5,Delightful for all ages,"This book is my first exposure to Demi, now I am hooked and will read all her books to my children who are quite young now but the message and illustrations will last for ages, from preschool to adult. Adults as well will delight in the gorgeous illustrations and deep spiritual message found in the text. A children's book of superb quality with a multicultural, philosophical and spiritual perspective."
4,Love,This is a nice story. I don't recommend it to read to a group of lower elementary students - they can't sit long enough for it. I tried it once and they got fidgety. But the story is wonderful and it sends a great message!!
1,B - HORRIBLE,THIS IS THE WORST CRAP I EVER HEARD!!!!!!WHY DID THE LABEL WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY?B - MORE NEEDS TO COME WITH IT!
3,dukeyman my man,i was just writing to big up dukeyman i used to go to school with him and seen him come a long way. from playing the keyboard behind dutches to doing his thing now. i'm proud to see them rep b-more and just to say you got a whole line of b-more soldiers behind you. you really shined on back to the streets i think and i like the way rich repped that. keep that spark alive baby. one
5,Great,Masterful history book. Shows how the Catholic Church built European civilization. Belloc is a very learned man and is a great writer
4,Great Stools....,"Went looking for two more Storehouse Portofino stools but the line is discontinued. Discovered these chairs at a fraction of the price. Purchased two, including shipping, for less than half of one of the Storehouse chairs. These chairs are of course not the same size, color or quality but look similar enough to use for extra chairs.They look great and like I paid much more than I did. Very happy with the purchase.++No assembly required!!"
4,gift,This was purchased as a gift for my mother who requested it. I'm assuming she liked as she asked for more in the series.
1,Not So Accurate ?,"I really wasn't enjoying this. The characters seemed one dimensional, the setting and plot in London seemed under researched. Then towards the end one of the minor characters is drowned off Australia's Great Barrier Reef, some 150 years before I thought they were discovered.So while I am quite prepared to be corrected on this it does leave me feeling doubtful about the book ( and the series)"
3,"Good guidebook, but the historical narrative is more narrow than in other books in this series","This is a combination history and guidebook for Caernarfon Castle in northwestern Wales. I'm a big fan of the series in which this book appears, but this one is below average in the group. It's more focused on the castle than some other books in this series, as opposed to providing a fuller narrative of the relevant history. This older style of narrative may reflecting the fact that the first edition was written in 1953 (though revised in 1993); most of the other books were written in the 1980s or 1990s.The guide part of the book, with extensive photographs and diagrams, is up to the standards in the rest of the series. If you are traveling to Caernarfon, this is an excellent choice.Postscript: it seems there may be a 2012 revision on the way. Investigate before making a decision."
3,Here's my opinion...,"I spent several months listening to Rostropovich, Yo-Yo Ma (Inspired by..), Wispelway, and Casals. I thought that Ma's and Wispelway's were the best recordings, with Ma's being a bit more dramatic, and having a bit more flair. Rostropovich's account struck me as exaggerated with ""squarish"" rhythms, over-interpreted. I really didn't like it. You can see the influence of Casals in Ma and Wispelway: quick,lively, dance-like, joyful, etc. The Casals is, of course, very well played but it's an old recording, and the sound is dry and, I think somewhat unpleasant. It's is possible that this is partly due to the transfer to digital. I used to like the LP a lot, but haven't played it for years. The recording quality of the Ma and Wispelway is excellent. If you were only going to own one set I'd recommend the Ma: Inspired by Bach set."
3,Off to the Races,"He plays Suite 1 as if he's in a hurry to get it over with.There are so many beautiful lines that just don't come through because he plays them TOO DOGGONE FAST.If you're looking for something to help you turn in a little faster time around the track, this recording just might do it. Otherwise, try another."
3,Not the greatest...,"I thought that these would be the best recordings of the suites but I sadly didn't understand them when played by Rostropovich.Casals's recording show the fire and dynamic drama, but when I listened to the Fournier, it all made sense!I would rather recommend the DVD version by Rostropovich over his Cd's."
2,Does not cut it technically,"I don't play the cello, but I imagine that these pieces must be very difficult given that Rostrapovich's recording is plagued with inaccurate intonation. When listening to this recording I find myself listening for the missed notes (practically every other one in some pieces) instead of to the music. In the liner notes Rostrapovich says he believes this to be the greatest music ever written. Unfortunately, the special affinity he has for this music doesn't come through in the performance."
1,Rostropovich's personality gets in the way of the playing,"It's not that he pulls tempi about. It's just that it is incredibly lifeless and mechanical in many parts, without much phrasing at all. It's hard to believe that a musician of this distinction could come up with a recording like this. Disappointing."
4,Apostrophe - Frank Zappa,"Every song on this CD shows the incredible genius of Frank Zappa, in my opinion one of the top 3 electric guitar players of all time. He was backed up by other rock greats such as Ansley Dunbar on drums, Jack Bruce on bass, and Sugar Cane Harris and Jean-Luc Ponty on violins, among others - as he should be, as not many artists of his time were capable of playing Zappa's music.The only disappointing feature of this CD is that this version does not have one of the songs I bought the CD for - Dynamo Hum."
4,Frank Zappa - His Comercial Peak,"Zappa had his first real commercial success with his previous album ""Overnight Sensation"" and ""Apostrophe"" would follow up with more novelty songs, especially ""Don't Eat The Yellow Snow"" which would actually garner him a significant amount of radio airplay. This is another album that gets mixed reviews from the Zappa faithful. Some loath it and yet it was Zappa's highest charting studio album and from a sales standpoint was probably the high water mark of his career. I like most of the tracks here especially the instrumental stuff which features Zappa at his best on guitar. I don't claim to be an expert on Zappa so I don't know how this compares to a lot of his material, but suffice to say it is a strong release and would probably be a good place to start if you were just looking into what Zappa was all about."
5,"dad, turn off that pots and pans music!","Apostrophe is a musical masterpeice in every sense of the word. yeah yeah I don't know the history of it or anything but frank zappa is the best artist the world has ever seen. The lyrics are fine just tying in to the odd times it was played and the hendrix/Zepplin inspired guitar is awsome. When I was a little boy I would yell ""turn off that pots and pans music"" but now I yell ""give me more oh great Zappa, give me more""."
5,What kind of guru are you anyway?,"This is great stuff, even all these years later. Excellent band and songs. During this era, Frank was doing some jazzy arangements but there's still alot of rock influence here too. The recording is a little on the dull side, which means you have to crank it up a bit to get the detail. See if you can find the secret message. Yellow Snow was a pretty big hit for the band but to me, Stink Foot, Cosmik Debris and Apostrophe' were the best part of the record, the crux of the biscuit!"
5,otra obra maestra,"que mas se puede decir....es lo mas popular de zappa, creo. lo mas digerible para un oido ocasional y aun asi no deja de ser una exquisitez.....ademas los musicos que reune en esta placa son verdaderos monstruos..basta con nombrar a jack bruce! que mas se puede decir, que mas se puede pedir??????"
3,Some good stuff ...,".... but way too short. This collection kicks off with the well-known ""Yellow Snow"" suite, which contains some good music (the ""Pancake Breakfast"" interlude), silly surrealistic humor ..... and then it just sort of ends. There is little else on this small collection of great consequence, considering the more groundbreaking work to be found on many other FZ recordings, though I do really enjoy the bit on ""Uncle Remus"" about getting up early and knocking over little plaster jockeys in Beverly Hills. Just why this album was the first by Zappa to score a gold record will forever remain a mystery to me."
5,is this zappa's best album?,"Maybe so. It is also probably his best band. FZ has often said that music shouldn't get in the way of good lyrics. He has also practiced (though not explicitly said) the opposite. This album is the exception. The two combine in a way rarely found: Humour and some of the most sophisticated music you're ever likely to hear come together here. I have a real problem if I have to compare this album to ""we're only in it for the money"" or ""200 Motels"" or ""Live in New York"", or ""Hot Rats"". But it may just be the best. I dicovered FZ through this album when I was 15. I have never looked back since."
5,How could this be out of print?,"As I read more and more O'Hara it is beginning to dawn on me that he is one of the pre-eminent American writers of the 20th Century. This book, in particular, looks at so many big themes across so many characters and storylines that it should be listed with the best novels of the century. Works by his better-known contemporary (but hardly peer) Fitzgerald are puny next to this writer's best stuff."
3,Ten North Frederick,I really liked the book so did my husband. The only problem being that it was so old it was falling apart as I turned each page. I had to put a rubber band around the loose pages so I didn't loose them.I also thought it was costly for an old paperback but since I never found it anywhere else I had no choice but to get it.
2,"Very good common sense summaries, low on scripture usage","This book does have quite a bit of actual Christian common sense content in the chapters; however, the actual chapters might have only two or three scripture references in them. To me, a book about ""What God wants"" should be quoting scripture a little more often to back up the content; scripture should be the ""meat and potatoes"", and in this book, it isn't referenced very often.To his credit, Michael Scanlan does an excellent job in the summary sections after each of the nine chapters trying to give actionable steps relation to each chapter. Again, though, it only gives you the ""big picture"", and has no supplemental scripture to reflect on while praying about the topic in the certain chapter.I'm not giving this book five stars due to the lack of scripture content to accompany the content in the chapters as well as the actionable summary items. However, I'm giving this two stars for the great summary sections."
3,"Conservative Opinions, Decent Decision Making Guidelines","Decent book with solid decision making suggestions if you are seeking a way to discern God's will for your life or for certain aspects of your life. At the same time, the author tends to be incredibly conservative in his approach and uses very classic gender roles in all of his examples. I don't always agree with his view, but it's a decent read. If you have a tendency to be liberal in your faith at ALL, this may not be the book for you."
3,Childhood fave missing great parts!,"This is an edited version of the Witching of Ben Wagner. Several parts mentioning witchcraft and nature have been cut out of this version. I'm going to be ordering the original version on VHS. Those of you who loved this movie as a child should be aware that this version is edited and should order the copies that specifically say ""Witching"" in the title."
5,I like it,I bought this dvd for my grandpa and aunts and uncles because my grandpa is actually in the movie. It was a good DVD and had good quality.
3,NOT HAPPY,"I WAS HAPPY WITH THE MESSAGE OF I CAN DO THINGS BUT I DID NOT CARE FOR THE REFERENCES EVEN IF IT WAS A JOKE FOR THE FRIENDS TO PRETEND TO BE WITCHES, I WILL NOT SHARE THIS WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN BECAUSE OF THAT ."
5,"Barber: Knoxville: Summer of 1915, Nocturne, Sure On This Shining Night, Adagio for Strings / Copland: Eight Poems of Emily Dick","Barber: Knoxville: Summer of 1915, Nocturne, Sure On This Shining Night, Adagio for Strings / Copland: Eight Poems of Emily Dickinson; Quiet City is a recording featuting the works of Aaron Copland and Samuel Barber. One also has teh immense joy to listen to soprano Barbara Hendricks. Michael Tilson Thomas conducts the London Symphony Orchestra. We also get to hear soloists Maurice Murphy on trumpet and Chrsitine Pendrill on English Horn. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."
1,The sky is falling!,"According to this fascinating, and well-researched book, the planet Earth is about to suffer a shift in the axis of its rotation, which will cause catastrophic damage. Worst of all, this shift is unavoidable, and will occur BEFORE the end of 2001.Oh...wait a minute...never mind.On second thought, don't buy this book."
2,help the axis of evil has shifted!!!,the problem wiht psychic prediction is that they can often be a bit 'symbolic'. Maybe Cayce was getting his metaphors mixed and was forseeing the drastic change in political climate from the 'axis of evil? shiftin!!!.i guess it keeps me entertained!i don't need a psychic to tell me that. But if you need one apparently the next opportunity to be proved right is in 2012.
2,confidence... ?!,"I just started reading this book last night, and could hardly continue. Not to offend anyone who did enjoy this book, but I did not like the writing style at all. Very basic and unprofessional with the word 'confidence' written over and over so many times that it was annoying. There were also other words used twice in the same paragraph which surely could have used a better synonym... it made it very difficult to try to figure out if there was really any substance to the book because I was busy trying to figure out if the author had used a good editor. Not sure that I will finish reading the book or not. Oh, and also, I bought it in 'good used condition' from a seller on Amazon, and it had a sticker ""clearance .49 cents"" on the cover! Not only tacky, but made me even more suspicious about the value of this book..."
3,Optimism,"I usually love Barbara's books & definitely always enjoy her writing style including this one. Her lengthier books written from heart-felt experiences are quite memorable. For me - this particular book barely made a blip on my radar screen. Was a very quick common-sense read & perhaps I need to re-read it. I was unaware there were different types of confidence, that much I learned."
1,Pass,"Could have been so much better. OK story line, but poor audio and shallow character development leave you bored quickly. Recommend skipping, isn't worth your time or money."
3,"First book was great, second book definitely lacking","I was thrilled with the first book in this series. It was so well done. It would make a great movie. But the second book, Captive Bride, was very disappointing. The plot jumps a quite a few years every few chapters. None of the characters were fully developed, not even the heroine. The author was trying to fit two separate stories into one book and didn't succeed."
5,THE GOOD WIFE:THE FIRST SEASON,I enjoyed watching the first season of this series because it seem to be so realistic to the way things actually happen in a court room.
5,Terrific Episode,"This show continues to maintain my interest with its top notch acting, directing and writing. The characters are well developed. The story in each episode, usually dealing with a new court case, is interesting as well as on-going plot lines. New characters played by guest stars such as Michael J. Fox keep the series fresh and exciting. I hope this series has a long run.This particular episode deals with the benefits and deficiencies of a jury deliberating on a charge of murder. Anyone who has sat on a jury will be able to identify with their dilemna whether to consider this or that piece of ""evidence"" credible. This episode, like all the others, is well paced and will hold your interest.As usual, David Paymer, does a great job as the judge."
5,Great show!,This is a very exciting drama with strong female characters. I am sucked in!! I will definitely get the whole series
5,Julianna Margulies at her BEST!,"If you liked Julianna Margulies is ER, then you'll love her as Alicia Florrick, the wife of a disgraced State's Attorney (played by Chris Noth from ""Sex and the City's - ""Mr. Big"" among other movies). She pursues her career as a State's Attorney, partnering with Will (played by Josh Charles as the tenacious detective in ""Four Brothers"" as well as ""Little City"" with Jon Bon Jovi); there is chemistry between the two, which adds as a side, on-going story line as to whether they will come together or not intimately. Alicia and Will are a great team and make for a great TV program with the suspense of looking for justice! A MUST SEE TV Program!"
4,"Excellent, yet understated show!","This is a well-acted well written show. While understated there are various plot lines going on, thus it never becomes rote or boring."
2,The Good Wife - DVD Packaging,"Ordered and received the item quickly. The problem lies inside the DVD case. When you have more than 1 DVD to any bundle/set you should NEVER - EVER - NOT EVER - attempt to stack DVDs on top of the other. First, they don't stay...thus causing scratches to happen to the DVD. SECONDLY you waste your customer's time in constantly trying to make sure they are properly placed so that they don't fall off which causes permanent damage to the DVD.Why not spend 50 cents more and place them back to back, like the other multi-DVD sets I own. It's not like your not charging a high price to purchase this product.This really bites. Now whenever I want to watch it in the future or lend it out to my DVD buddies, I will have to warn them of the cheaply made packaging and issues with the DVDs constantly slipping off and then verify that they are not scratched after each use.LOUSY PACKAGING....."
5,Compelling Drama,"This is one of the best shows out there. I love the fact that this show deals with contemporary issues and lots of moral dilemmas. It's fascinating to watch Julianna Marguiles' character navigate her way through the complications of life, all the while trying to stay true to her values.An edgy series that keeps you coming back for more."
5,Avast! No CD collection is complete without this CD,"Pirates. Pirate stories. Pirate songs. Just plain pirate fun! Captain Bogg and Salty's CD is well produced and beautifully written. It is fun through and through. Each listening gets better and better. Buy this CD you won't regret it for a moment! Children, adults, and pirates of all ages will find a favorite song (if not all of them). For the best song to turn a bad day to a good day listen to and sing along with ""Scurvy"". This song puts it all into perspective. Oh, just go buy the CD!"
5,Blasted Bilge-Rats!,"This CD is a delightful romp through life on the Pollywogg, a pirate ship captained by Angus Bogg. With stories and music that explore pirate life, the crew take up accordians, tipples, ukeleles and join a rock band.The songs are really well-written, and do not pander or condescend. Truly a CD for all ages to enjoy.I liked it so much, I joined the band."
4,First Christmas,"I saw this story and decided that I would purchase it for my SS class. When I received it, I was delighted with the pictures and the simple story for my Kindergarteners."
2,A dull effort,"'Jack and Jill' is as far from the entertaining March family as L.M.Alcott could possibly get. The story of the two friends never rises above the mediocre.The characters are so roughly sketched in that they certainly do not live in the book though the reader may be able to find similar characters in Alcott's other works. Rates high on my list only for the good, old fashioned values it tries to express but would probably be rejected by todays readers as being too preachy, a fault that does not plague Alcott's better efforts. On the whole a must only if you are a staunch fan."
4,I've read better...,"I have read many books by Louisa May Alcott, but this was definitely not my favorite. It was a little too childish, and was boring in some parts. It's not like I don't enjoy those type of books, I really love reading. Some parts of the book were really good. I especially liked the parts about Jill's friends Merry and Molly. It's a good book with a good moral, but not for those who enjoy exciting books."
4,very excitin book which reads well without becoming tedious,this is one of my favorite books.it is easy to read without being childish
2,Child's rhyme and story,"This has a sticky, preachy quality about it -too sweet. but although the beginning bears a resemblance to the rhyme, the story is for young adults and adults. No where as good as Little Women"
3,Nursery ryme to book,"Take the nursery ryme ""Jack and Jill"" for a starting point, speculate the consequenses, and you more or less have this book. Add in alot of moral preaching, make the kids way to good to be true, and you do have this book."
2,Surprised at the raves for this,I simiply can't understand the excitement over this disc; ... There are many better versions of Mathis der Maler on CD--some easily found here at Amazon...
2,Go Hollywood...!,"I am missing most of the excitement here. If you think 20th century music should be dull and boring, then this is your CD. Sorry, but this is no match, for say, the latest LA Phil recording under Esa-Pekka Salonen, which just sparkles with energy and ""Drang"". Just naming one recent example here. Sawallisch makes me fall asleep.A major disappointment. Go where the exitement is: Go Hollywood!"
4,Fine Hindemith from Sawallisch and the Philadelphians,"I'm not sure whether this is the best Hindemith recording I've heard, but it is certainly very impressive, starting with EMI's excellent recording. Sawallisch shows that he is a fine interpreter of Hindemith's scores, most notably in the Mathis der Maler, which is emotionally intense, gripping, and yet, not nearly as loud or bombastic as other accounts I've heard. The Philadelphia Orchestra truly shines in this recording, playing with as much warmth and technical skill as you'd expect from the likes of the Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic or Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Anyone interested in a fine introduction to Hindemith's major orchestral works won't be disappointed with this recording."
5,A Great Hindemith CD!!,This recording of Hindemith is great! Swallisch conducts it remarkably. The orchestra isn't overpowering and the overall sound of the CD is great. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Hindemith as much as I do. This is one of my favorite CD's
3,Claddagh Ring,The McCourts are not my favorite authors. Claddagh Ring is frothy. Doesn't say a lot. No original research that I could determine.
2,Tract Porter Artesian Road Salad Server,"Very delicate, I would never have use these if you still have children in the home. I don't even trust my own husband with these! They are long and very fragile. Looks pretty however with the bowl that comes with it but better be careful not to break it!"
2,This EHG is not good quality,Less than two months and half of them are in the trash. My old tapes are doing bettereven in the same machine
3,Watched through Roku,"This was a movie we rented through Amazon/Roku because Netflix didn't have it. Interesting to have movie Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) in scenes with TV Oscar Madison (Jack Klugman) where Felix is the drunk and Oscar is the voice of sobriety. Not great (a little Alcoholics Anonymous preachy and the characters aren't terribly likable), but a nice cheap evening."
1,Had to return it.,"I was unaware that there were ""Zone"" issues and I couldn't play a UK DVD in Texas. Should've been a clear warning on the selection and not on the package after I bought it.And I didn't need suggestions to purchase a universal code player!"
4,Hit Me!,"Jack Lemmon's character in this film used this phrase: Hit Me! for ordering another drink.His performance in this film ranks among one of his best, going all out and in a most committedmanner.His acting was strongly supported by the young Lee Ramick who gave a similar level of dedicationto her art.Blake Edward,the director and the screen writer contributed strongly to the end result of this film.A very well-made film on the subject of alcoholism par excellence."
5,It's Great Movie but wrong info.,I've already had this movieiTunes version.This item mentioned in this page...Color!!So I choose this.Great Movie. Great Jack Lemmon(I miss him so much!!)but....not COLOR.
5,Harrowing,"From the performances to the black and white film to the music, this film is a harrowing and realistic look at the ravages of alcoholism and what it can take to get sober."
5,i knew the child actress when this was being made,"at the time of the making of this film debbie mcgowan was my best friend. i never saw the movie but know enough about it by reading the book. i wasn't allowed to see the movie. i still haven't seen it . even though i have met the actors in real life. both jack lemmon and lee remmick were really alcoholic in real life. debbie and i were not treated so well by our parents. anyway i sure would like to see her again. they always choose redheads for parts, she was really lucky. .i am anxious to rent or buy the film and finally see it.it will probably bring back a lot of memories of being 7 again. they took a long time to finally destribute this film. it's not like today .sometimes produciton took 3 years.Days of Wine and Roses, Moon River and Other Academy Award Winners"
4,"The Title Song Won Oscar: The Movie Was Good, Too",I knew the title song before seeing the movie. Chronicles the destruction that alcohol addiction can bring to all involved. The performances by Lee Remake and Jack Lemmon were excellent. Ever drinker will see themselves. Well worth the time and the dime.
1,Wrong Format ( Days of Wine & Roses),Be careful ordering this it is from the UK and is in a different format than US. I cant watch it on my player. Be careful!
1,Do not pay to download this!,"Do not pay to download this article. Why, with the wealth of material on Ovid, would anyone charge for this review? Or worse, pay for it, as I did. The review skims through various versions of Metamorphosis without any compelling points to make, giving no sense of the argument of the book. This article does not even mention Ted Hughes, who is named in the title. The review spends one paragraph on the 18th c. and makes only superficial comments about Shakesepeare. You would do better to buy the book than buy this review. Had the review been free, I would have been much more charitable. But not for $5.95."
5,"Moving, haunting and absolutely lovely.","Everyone who has heard this CD in my home has been moved by it. Recently, I went to a Smashing Pumpkins concert at the Fleet Center in Boston. When my husband and I entered the arena, this CD was playing at full volume. It was probably the most spiritual experience of my life."
5,Masterpiece,"A True Masterpiece in every way. The songs are Great and different in style, though real Kate. The production is outstanding for 1985.Kate is sensitive, so is the album.Kate is experimental, so is the album.Kate is A Perfectonist, so is the album.Kate proved with this album she is the best female artists the UK has to offer(and probably worldwide).Kate captured the 80's but this album has proven to be timeless.And it still grows on me.Now about this Remaster; Back in 1985 I worked over at the Dennon dealer for the Benelux and this was one of the standards for listening and reviewing.And CD was still a new item back then.Listening to this Remaster, there is a more booming sound than earlier. But Drums do Boom (in real life!), so this is a more acurate presentation.I Like It, I Love It!Also the bonus traks are a real treat."
5,The kind of album that changes people's lives,"I first heard this album over 12 years ago when I was still a teenager and I listen to it this very day. Few other albums have that kind of longevity. It's the ""Ulysses"" of pop albums: an extraordinarily dense, lush, lyrical, damn-near cinematic journey full of secrets that it slowly reveals only upon repeat, repeat, repeat listenings."
5,Kate Bush at her finest...,"I bought this album over 17 years ago, when it first came out in 1985. I can honestly say I have listened to it at least once every year. Each time, I seem to find something I missed the last time I listened. How many albums can you say that about?"
5,A Masterpiece that grows and grows...,"This is still one of my favourite albums of all times. It's a complete masterpiece. Profoundly moving. It will move anybody. The more you listen; and get all the layers, you will be awakened. Thank you Kate for this incredible, beautiful album. It is NOT to be missed!"
1,I must humbly disagree with the other reviews,"I must be crazy but I think that this CD is simply awful! Maybe it is Kate's style but this CD to me is about as enjoyable as listening to fingernails on a blackboard. I mean just what in the name of Elisabeth Frazier, Sandra or Sarah Brightman is this woman trying to do? A real Excederin headache for me."
5,Kate's world,The whole work of Kate always inspired me: Since listening to the Hounds of Love I really get addicted to Kate's work and during the last ten years this unique masterpiece of music still moves me.
5,Masterpiece Material,"I can easily say this is the best Kate disc ever offered to the public. Each song running perfectly in unison, taking the listener a long walk through a forest. At first, it all feels fun and carefree until the trail leads to insomnia and then the waking of the witch. For me, this cd is so powerful because though it is filled with pop hooks, Kate allows for new and inventive way to present them. Each song is a gem. A truly remarkable feat."
5,What's she mean?,"A number of years ago, I heard a person describing what she was going to do for the weekend, ""...going home, kick off my shoes, open a bottle of good wine and get into some Kate Bush.""I had no idea who Kate Bush was but my curiosity got the best of me.Wine is so much better now..."
5,"wild, visionary, spectral","Simply brilliant. I never tire of its majesty. Yes, I said. Yes! Delicate weaving gives continual pleasure as on the 13th listen you discover a previously unfound connection. Practically hypertextual. Gothic, perverse, erotic, excessive. Yes, I said again. Dreamy. Lost. Underappreciated by so called 'Alternatives.' Essential. Thank you, Kate."
5,"Her best album, and then some...","""Hounds..."" was Kate's breakthrough album in the U.S., and earned her her only U.S. Top 40 single with ""Running Up That Hill."" This British version of the album features A and B sides from a string of 12"" vinyl singles that are fairly rare, and sound exceptional in this package.There are highlights all over the place, but the song suite ""The Ninth Wave"" (the original ""B"" side for the album) is a conceptual wonder that integrates Rock effectively with Kate's Irish-folk sensibility. Of the bonus tracks not originally available on ANY version of this album, ""My Lagan Love"" and ""Under The Ivy"" are quiet but potent ballads, and ""Burning Bridge"" will have you kicking up your heels.This version of ""Hounds..."" may not be the thing for casual fans, but it's an excellent choice for Kate's hardcore following.-Mic"
3,Overrated,"This album is not that great. So many people gush about how ""historic"" and ""stupendous"" the album is, but personally I just don't see it. Is this a bad album? No, it's not bad at all. But I don't think it's one of Kate's best. Actually, there aren't any bad songs on the album. On the other hand, there aren't that many great, exciting ones either. This album is certainly worth a listen, but it really isn't all it's cracked up to be in my opinion."
2,Not her best by a long shot,"This album always leaves me with mixed feelings. ""Running Up That Hill"" I find tedious and repetitive (though it's the best song here). The entire first side sounds like an introduction to drum machine programming. To my ears, it gets monotonous. The Big Sky, and to a lesser extent, Cloudbursting suffer from the same drum machine problem. When Kate sings ""Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen"" I don't believe her, and the delivery isn't ironic either. And what else is there? The second side (The Ninth Wave) is one disaster after another. Waking the Witch has laughable theatrics; the dirges on Hello Earth reek of bored composition from a bad Chant album. The deliberate Irish music injections feel out of place. Kate simply sounds out of energy, out of emotive powers. Her delivery in The Morning Fog is flat as the flat [Hello] Earth. Compared to The Dreaming or Lionheart or The Kick Inside, this album sounds bored, whiny...and not fun...and not interesting."
2,Not Lionheart,"I first discovered Kate Bush when she released Lionheart. I can no longer play that old vinyl album, so I thought I would buy it in CD. After logging on and reading the reviews, I decided to by Hounds of Love instead. If it's better than Lionheart, it must be great. I am very disappointed. She does not display her vocal range on this CD, which was one of the things I originally found fascinating in her music. I didn't find the haunting or varied melodies I expected. And only a few tracks demonstrated her abilities with lyrics. Several of the reviews suggested her music had 'matured' with this CD. My impression is that she dumbed it down, or made it more generic, to appeal to a wider audience. I'm going back to Lionheart."
3,Jedi for a month,"The Costume is unmistakably Jedi. Which is good. The belt way to large. it fit my wife perfectly, way too big for my 4 year old. The material sheer, poorly sewn and sans durability.We got four good trick or treat events out of it but it is heavily threading. sleeves and bottom of shirt especially.Overall a good costume to last a month. But would highly doubt it will last much longer. We got the robe and it really made the outfit. All cheap material. But this is Halloween and the whole family really should have fun as this is a holiday of fun."
4,Fair quality and could double as a Harry Potter robe,"This cloak is satisfactory on quality. I would buy it again. one of the things I found with it is it is virtually identicale to the harry Potter robes, So it has a double purpose. The length on it makes it useful for many sizes of kids. I would guess 7-12 years old can wear it comfortably.I believe this is a good buy."
5,Have had for three years and we love it,We have already used this costume for three Halloweens. What really makes the costume though is the deluxe Jedi Robe we purchased with it. It is durable and my oldest son has now outgrown it. The real reason I'm writing is that I was in the market for another DULUXE star wars outfit this year and noticed all the bad reviews on the other DELUXE versions of the star wars costume. If you get the robe you won't regret it. Hopefully they haven't downgraded the product since we bought ours like three years ago. We have also been very happy with the infant yoda baby fleece costume. I have three boys. The third will be wearing it this year. Firt each boy uses it as yoda. The next year they are a padawon (yoda without the ears). And then they move up to jedi knight (The obiwon deluxe outfit with his jedi robe).
4,Great Jedi robe,"I bought this robe for my 5 year old son. He loves it and seriously wears it every day! He is heavily into all things Star Wars, it was a perfect birthday present for him. I did have to reinforce the seams (there were 2 small holes along the seam when it arrived) But given that he wears it all day, inside and outside the house, it has held up just fine. The fabric is thick and durable and it washes nicely. If your kid loves Star Wars, I'd advise spending the money for this robe."
4,cute,It's a cute costume all around. It was a little big on him though. He is 5 1/2 and could have done the small.
2,Jedi sleeved robe,"This Jedi robe is a perfect halloween costume for your kids, includes a hood, with sleeves, that's it. But your child will feel like a protector of the galaxy, wearing this nice Jedi robe. Item does not include tunic, tan shirt, illusional pull over belt, or boot tops, it's just a basic jedi robe."
1,Eddie Hampton Armani should be ashamed of himself.,"I do not recomend this book to anyone, it paints a portrait of Tina Turner quite opossite of who she really is. It tries to tell you that Tina Turner is selfish and rude, while in reality she is just about the nicest person I have had the pleasure to meet. This book is also full of mistakes about Tina's life, her wigs, her tours, her temper, ect................... Don't waste your money on this title!!!"
2,Greed,"I'd just like to express my extreme disgust at the majority of the content of this frivilous book. Mr. ""Armani"" paints a picture of Tina that is growingly self-centered, manipulative and cold, which is precisely the opposite of ""The Real T"". He does a relatively good job at expressing his convictions and in trying to convince the reader of this, but, herein lies the key word ""Trying"". He certainly has not convinced me, nor will he. Anybody with half a brain knows that this guy is out to make money off of his 'idol'. Talk about hypocracy! Not only does he share with the entire world all of her most private and personal experiences, but he adamantly states that he would never ""hurt or embarrass"" her...hmmmm...I wonder what he considers this book to be doing...."
3,"Good read, but you gotta wonder...","I know this guy had to be close to Tina-but you really gotta wonder with these kind of books, what is true and what isn't. Some facts don't really line up. He says he made Tina her first big wig and she wore it the night of the PRIVATE DANCER Tour that made it onto tape. Well, I had seen her well before that with the big wig. And it also says she opened for the Stones on their STEEL WHEELS tour...she didn't. That was in 1989, I believe he meant back in 80 81."
4,Royce Toiletry Bag,"Overall the Royce Toiletry Bag w/zippered Bottom Compartment is a first class piece of luggagebut the bottom compartment does take space away from the main top compartmemt. Materials and workmanship are 2nd to none. If the top compartment were a little larger I'd give 5 stars easy. As it is, it is a strong 4. ****"
3,This toiletry bag is just OK,"I bought this bag for my son for Christmas. I opened the package upon delivery and was pleasantly surprised to see this toiletry bag came in a really nice sturdy box with the name Royce on the outside. This leather bag itself seems to be bulky and heavy, and the zipper is somewhat difficult around the ends or folds of the bag. Let's see what my son thinks on Christmas day. The jury is out!"
5,Very nice,Awesome music CD. Worked great for my husband's 50th Luau Birthday Party. Everyone enjoyed the whole CD look forward to our next Luau!!
2,Don't judge this book by its cover,"I give this book 2.5 stars. The plot line is good, heroine prejudges hero due to her past superficial attitude. (Who says construction workers have no ambition are not educated, what do they teach you all in the USA?) Hero rightly prejudges heroine for her high maintence, superficial ways. I did not root for them to get together, I wished there was a twist at the end where the guy dumps the woman permanently after finding out that she only finds him suitable, even tho she is very attracted to him after she finds out he used to earn big bucks and has 2 degrees.A weak link in a series that is not really about the romance and more about the town."
2,Just not well written,"I read this book without having read the others in the series. The story had enough background to stand alone. The plot was good. Two people are brought back to their hometown to care for aged and or ailing grandparents. The problem with the book was the author's lack of character development. All of the characters in the book were flat and one dimensional. The heroine was very difficult to like. She liked the guy was wouldn't date him because he was a construction worker. Without ever having any in depth conversations with him, she decided he lacked ambition. He was likeable enough but pegged her as high maintenanced, which she was, but he dated her anyway. At the end, he considered going back to a corporate culture he hated to please her...A lot of characters were sterotypes and not very plausible...Story just didn't live up to the potential of the plot."
2,Disappointed,"I had seen the Indigo Girls on Jay Leno TV show back in 1994-95, and they were very good. So recently I decided to purchase their early years DVD ""Live at the Uptown Lounge"" from 1990. I found it to be a disappointment. There was no back-up band, the two female voices were not as harmonized as in later years, they were dressed poorly, and the sound/picture quality was not as good. The two singers are young and enthusiastic in this DVD concert, as are their audience members. But overall, not worth the purchase price."

3,"Finding Rin Tin Tin is set in WWI Europe, not in the west of the 1950s TV series.","Finding Rin Tin Tin is some what interesting, but is set in WWI Europe, not in the west of the 1950s TV series."
3,slapstick hero,"This is good family fun, that is if you believe 2-dimensional characters performing slapstick humor is your slingshot to the simpler times. I didn't grow up watching the 3 stooges, but my uncles did. Therefore, it is always good fun in the family when you have somebody who can reminisce about this type of comedy, but it doesn't really resonate with me. FYI, I watched Disney and Ghibli Studio productions growing up; and Ghibli productions in general all have very complex character developments with very moving plot lines. I guess I was hoping to find the same in this film, because after all who says kids can't appreciate complex characters and storylines!All in all, a good relaxing evening if you've got nothing better to do."
1,This movie is a total fraud,"Since this movie's creation and release I learned that it is not a Rin Tin Tin dog in the movie, but dogs from a Bolivian breeder. It is not based on the actual Rin Tin Tin line and is a total shame on the trademark name of Rin Tin Tin. This is a lawsuit in the making and I only hope the owners of the REAL Rin Tin TIn do something about it. You can go to the actual Rin Tin Tin web site and find out that the makers of this movie knew at the time that they were violating the trademark and released it anyway. The entire movie is a lie that can only hurt the Rin TIn TIn name."
3,"Good movie, good DVD","Since Amazon unfortunately lumps all reviews of a given work together regardless of medium or edition, I'm writing this to say that my copy of the ""Endhiran 2 DVD Special Edition"" version is just fine. Good quality, good subtitles, good packaging. Appears genuine and not pirated. The film is not a masterpiece, but it's great eye candy, the story is not overly stupid (albeit predictable), and the acting is fine."
3,no friggin sound,"seriously, sound on the title screen hit play and nothing, thank god for subtitles, but I am really let down by the manufacturer, such a epic movie and 3 hours with musical numbers and no sound."
1,Might as well be written by Castro himself,This book is propaganda pure and simple. I had to read this for a poli sci class last semester and it is horrible. It begins with the increaing interest in Marxism and socialism. And then goes on to profile che guvara and Castro and the implications for socialism after the 5 billion dollar subsidies dried up after the early 1990's.Don't waste your time buying or reading this extremely short and biased work. Their is no information and only tiny philosophical reasons why communism didn't fail after the U.S.S.R fall. Very short and biased and contains nothing of substance. Also very expensive for what amounts to propaganda.
1,A Blatant Alteration of the Dore's Original Work,"This work is a blatant example of revisionism. The first 2 plates have been ""doctored"" to remove the human form of God from the creation and garden of Eden accounts. While Dore's work is beautiful, this book is not an accurate representation of it."
2,The Ghosts of Denver Capitol Hill,I was so excited when on Ghost Adventures I saw Phil Goldstein talking about his book. I had to have it. I mean it had to be good being on the show. By the way love the show! The seller got the book to me fast! So I started reading the 472 page book with excitement. The excitement quickly turned to what the heck! This book is about the detailed history of Capitol Hill with a few ghost stories. I will give it to Phil I have never seen a book so detailed about the history of a city he did a good job on the history part on the ghost part I'd give him an F. If your buying the book because you like history its a must have. If your buying it for the ghost stories don't bother.
5,Hauntingly Spooktacular!!,"This book is a fascinating read-- not just about historic Denver/ Capitol Hill area-- but also because of the ghost stories.Yes, there are many, many, many ghost stories in this book. You have to look for them, though, because they are interspersed among the fascinating historical content of the book.There are so many ghost stories` and in the back of his book you can also look up ""ghosts"" and it tells you what pages includes ghost stories.Taking Phil Goodstein's tour- Ghosts of Capitol Hill (www.freeu.com)- is highly recommended. The man is a genius- and he knows his Denver history AND his ghost stories.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book!"
2,"Although I love the poem, this copy is only volume II","I love Don Juan passionately and it's one of my favorite things in literature -- it's so witty and perfect. However, nothing in the copy or marketing materials explained that this particular hardcover edition by ""Don Juan and The Booksellers"" is only cantos 7 to 17. So, having bought it as a present for someone, I'm stuck trying to figure out how to find only Vol 1, or buy another copy. Don't be fooled!"
3,Decent enough for the wrong edition.,"I ordered this book for a graduate class. I used the ISBN which gives me the penguin edition that you see on the picture. All seemed right with the world. However, when I got the book in the mail, it is not a penguin edition. The cover is pink and white. I dropped the class due to other issues so I don't know how it stacks up. However, this is a concern for me since I know a lot of instructors issue the reading, qoutes, etc. based on a certain edition. Not to mention that some editions have secondary material that is not in all books (articles, footnotes, appendixes, etc). The novel, by itself, is pretty cool. I started reading it on a plane trip. My issue was just with the seller."
1,I struggled,"I struggled with the forced rhyme. I struggled with the story itself. I think the rhyme scheme got in the way for me. I was so lost and uninterested so frequently. I will put it away, and I will pick it up later some time. Maybe I'm not ""there"" yet."
4,It Really Grows on You,"This album originally seemed uninspired, nowhere near as cohesive as even *Hours*-- a pastiche.But after a few days of listening to it, it's grown on me, just like every Bowie ablum since 1980's *Scary Monsters*, but quicker--I just didn't GET it. Though Bowie will probably not attract many new fans with this album (as he did with *1: Outside*), every song contains references and allusions to a previous Bowie song: ""A Better Future"" echos ""Fantastic Voyage"" from *Lodger*, for example, and ""*Slip Away"" echoes both ""Life on Mars"" and ""Ashes to Ashes""...pop, yet postmodern at its most fun. Some poignant lyrics, too."
4,Almost Classic Bowie,"This is really good. Bowie continues the return to his 70's style that started with Hours but this is better. The album starts off with the ominous ""Sunday,"" which sports a very heavy sound followed by the catchy and accessible ""Cactus."" The best tracks on the album are the memorable ""Slow Burn"" and ""A Better Future."" Also notable are ""Slip Away"" and ""Everyone Says Hi."" The lower points are ""I've Been Waiting For You,"" and ""The Angels Have Gone"" but they are far from unlistenable. Definitely worth owning and a must-have for those who were fans of Bowie before its release."
4,The man can do Anything,"This was definately a new direction for Bowie, but I'm glad he took it. If you ask me, he's just proving that he can do anything. It's got some great hits on it, the most memorably ""Slip Away"" and ""Slow Burn"". Notice that this album is released through Columbia, and not Virgin records. I wonder if that means all his older albums will now get re-released. Who knows. This album takes an extension on the newer electirc style he seems to like alot lately, but it's still a lot of fun. If you're a fan, go for it. If not, feel free to pick it up, it's great stuff, but not what people from the 70s are talking about when they say ""Bowie"""
4,"Don't call it a comeback, he's been here the whole time...","This album is a lot different than his work as of late. Albums like Earthling seemed to focus on Bowie's ability to sound like a millenium man. That album was missing the feeling of a real band, all you heard were big beats and synthisizors. With this new album, you can hear the instruments, and feel the beat at the same time. This is a great combination of band and big beat techno.The other great thing about this album is how moody it is. It is a laid back vibe, especially on the first track ""Sunday."" My personal favorites for this are "" I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship,"" ""I Would Be Your Slave,"" and ""Cactus."""
3,"Oh dear, more ""Hours""","I bought this eagerly because I was sure Bowie would go ""Upbeat"" again after the downbeat Hours. Not so.I think that Outside and Earthling had much more ""sound"" to enjoy, and better melodies.There is a kind of girl singer I call ""weepy girls"". Like Sade. (Sadly most of them are not as good as her.) Well, this is weepy Bowie.Bowie said in an interview after Hours that he is very happy, but Hours was made about the typical person of his geneation, who isn't happy. Well, I wish he would get back to his own viewpoint.I don't wish to sound bitter, but I had such high hopes for this album."
2,"best of his recent work, which is garbage","Several covers and return of Toni Visconti make Heathen a worthwhile listen. It is hard to believe anyone who has actually heard early Bowie, would claim this is 'as good or better'. Every release has people saying hes better than ever, but a year later no one is listening to the same record. His 70s and 80s work, remains influential to this day, though his body of work overall seems out of fashion at the moment.This is pop from a pop genius who long ago lost his muse and inspiration. What remains is servicable pop, and a few excellent tracks to discover among the mire. It is hard to say Bowie ever made a bad album, everything past lets dance, has been at best unimportant, at worst mediocre formula pop."
2,Duped Again,"As with the Elvis Costello release earlier this year, I once again fell victim to the hype and rushed out to buy Bowie's new one. What a disappointment. I know it's almost sacreligious to denounce a Bowie effort, but I just don't see what all the excitement over Heathen is about. There's really not one tune on here that hops off like a ""Diamond Dogs"" or ""Golden Years."" In fact, the Bowie I hear on the radio these days is not Bowie from Heathen but rather Bowie from the early days. This cd is probably playing well with those grasping to hang on to their ""Aren't I cool cuz I listen to Bowie"" mentality that may have meant something in the 70s and early 80s, but it's over folks. Move on now. Bowie is washed up and Heathen proves it. Am I going to hell now?"
4,Bowie for Moms & Dads,"The best song on the album, ""Cactus"" is a Pixies cover. That is NOT a criticism. Bowie does for ""Cactus"" what Jimi Hendrix did for Bob Dylan's ""All Along The Watchtower"" -- he makes it his own.This album is similar to, but less daring than, ""Station to Station"", but anything compared to that classic record pales by comparison.What I particularly like about ""Heathen"" is that 1)Bowie's two best assests - his voice and his personality - are front and center. This is a well produced record."
4,A welcome return to form,"Well, it's been way too long since Bowie put out a really good album and fortunately that time has passed. ""Heathen"" is a lot better than I ever could've expected. The tracks ""5:15 The Angels Have Gone"", ""Slow Burn"", ""Sunday"" & ""Slip Away"" are definitely Bowie classics. I just hope after this album I won't have to wait another 20 years for another great one from Bowie."
3,Staying power,"3 1/2Some of the writing is decidedly average, but his seasoned studio band layers enough polish (great bass work) and of course Bowie's endlessly admirable vocal charisma elevate much of the space-pop-rock while this original chameleon continues to evade irrelevance."
5,He's Back (never left?),"From start to finish Heathen displays the range and depth of Bowie's talent.E.G., we have some of his haunting and somewhat discordant sax and echoes of Low.We have NEW lyrics that capture his ability to combine mundane with those little thought sparks we all have (i.e, Everyone Says Hello).Right now, my Favorite is Heathen. Its Bowie at what he does best - an listenable song that challenges God!"
3,It has my song of this particular moment on it,"I bought Heathen for the song the ""Everyone says""Hi"""". This song is low-key, slightly melancholy and intimate. In this song, in David Bowie's vocals and lyrics, I hear qualities of world-weariness, irony and perhaps a wish for the old times. I don't know what the song is really about but its tone and manner makes me feel nostalgic and reminds me of my student days and old girlfriends."
3,"Solid effort, but a step back...","Bowie's best work is undoubtedly from the 1970s up to Scary Monsters(1980) or Let's Dance(1983). From there, he took a nose-dive in quality. Personally, I've greatly enjoyed his comeback albums- Outside(1995), Earthling(1997) and even Hours(1999). However, I think Heathen(2002) is a step back: musically, it's simply not as melodic or interesting as his 90s work; lyrically, it's a bit flat. (This is probably due to the departure of Reeves Gabrels, Bowie's long-time song-writing partner.) Overall, a solid effort, but hardly deserving of all of the exuberant praise here."
4,breath of fresh air,"a co worker lent this to me. she said she thought it was junk. she could not be more wrong. in my opinion, bowie has returned to a more traditional rock approach. there is not the electronic-ness of ""im afraid of americans"" or the mellow-ness of HOURS. bowie presents us with a more middle of the road rock record with some enhancements both electronic as well as musical.the songs are strong although i found a few fell flat but for the most part, this is a well crafted and great sounding record. this is one of bowie's best."
2,1/2 of the story we wanted to read,"I expected a book about Robert Hanssen - how he spied and what made him tick. That came across in about half of the book. Unfortunately, Mr Vise didn't have enough material to write a book of reasonable length, so he improvised with a lot of uninteresting material on the life of FBI director Louis Freeh, and way too much rehash of the Aldrich Ames and Timothy McVeigh stories. Although a lot of interesting details emerged on Hanssen, I still don't understand the man. Several aspects of his life appear to contradict each other, and the psychiatrist explanations left me unfulfilled. This book in no way approaches the ""Betrayal"" book on Ames by Weiner, Johnston and Lewis."
2,Don't waste your money.,"In the beginning I found this book interesting but in the later chapters Mr Vise began to drift away from the crux of the book.In one chapter, he devotes 16 pages to then FBI Director Louis Freeh and his clash with former President Clinton. He touches on the bombings of the Khobar Towers, Oklahoma City, the Atlantic Olympic Park in 1996, and the investigation of Wen Ho Lee, the mathematician at Los Alamos National Lab. What has this have to do with Robert P. Hanssen? I suggest that if you really want to read this book go to your local [store] and spend a few hours there to peruse it rather than purchase it. I was very dissapointed in the author to add pages of useless information in an effort to boost the price of this book."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I was excited to read this book but was very disappointed. The book attempted to juxtapose Robert Hannsen's life with that of Louis Freeh's but, in the end, didn't do justice to either one. The background provided to Hanssen's upbringing was informative, but after the onset of Hanssen's spying, the book simply seemed to bounce chronologically in no coherent fashion between Hanssen's spying and Freeh's career at the FBI. Paragraphs seemed to be independently written and then patched together in the best manner possible from the author's point of view, but the book laked flow. Moreover, numerous digressions into events like the Oklahoma City bombing and Ruby Ridge served no purpose other than to increase the number of pages in the book. Having read and really enjoyed Stuart Herrington's ""Traitors Among Us,"" another book about Cold War espionage, I thought this book fell rather flat."
2,Simplistic writing; exploitative passages; naive analysis,"What a fascinating story and what a dissapointing book. The book is written at the high school level at best. But aside from the authorship, most troubling was the level of pure exploitation of Hanssen's perversity. The lengthy quotation from Hanssen's pornography (including an entire appendix) can only be considered gratuitous. Why humiliate Mrs. Hanssen by offering her husband's lewd tales of their sex life? Finally, the virtually fawning descriptions of Louis Freeh's career show a very naive understanding of the way such cases are brought, and it is disrepectful of the many agents and line prosecutors who actually brought Hanssen to justice."
1,Ninth grade level writing...,"The cover notes that the author is a Pulitzer Prize winner, but he won't get one for this book. I found it repetitive and trashy. A waste of money!"
2,Wait for the paperback version,"Obviously a rushed to print book. It was heavy on ""facts"" - not always about the main subject - and would've been well suited for a magazine article. While it was interesting, I recommend you wait for the paperback."
5,Fascinating Book,"This book was a page turner. The author built a psychological profile of Robert Hansesn as well as reported historical facts, to try to give us some insight into his motivation, as well as placed him in a historical context. How could someone who loved this country and was devoted to law enforcement become such a terrible traitor and cause the death of so many people? It gives an amazing account."
1,What a dissappointment.,"This book reads like a civics lesson for 7th graders. Atmosphere, texture and character development are pushed aside by oversimplifications and cliches (Freeh is described as ""square-jawed""). Juxtaposing Hanssen's story with Freeh's story is an amateurish device. Attempts at a psychological understanding of Hanssen lack depth, and ultimately collapse into pop psychology. In Hanssen's treachery there is an exciting, complex story to be told, but this book fails to do it justice."
2,Reads like a gossip column,"There are several books on this topic and I was uncertain which to read. I went with Vise based on his Pulitzer Prize. Frankly, I was disappointed. The book is not very well written. There's not much new here you couldn't get from the New York Times. Vise fills pages by writing alternating chapters about FBI director Louis Freeh. But Vise's lionized portrait of Freeh as courageous crime fighter rings hollow, particularly in light of September 11, and other FBI failures on Freeh's watch. The book gives you all the relevant information about Hansson, who was clearly a very dangerous and disturbed person. But the writing doesn't read like top rate journalism; it feels like gossip column filler. Although I haven't read the other books on this case, I'd recommend starting elsewhere."
1,general waste of time,"save your money and check it out from the library if you must read it. however, i'm sure there's better, more qualified books out there on this guy. do i have to give it a star? how about negative stars? disappointing book. gratuitous sex was insulting...bedroom antics didn't have anything to do with hanssen's destructive betrayal of this country. book seemed to be thrown together. was it about hanssen, ames, clinton, freeh? who? title infers it's about hanssen, but author must have run out of resources to copy. there's nothing new! glad i didn't buy it."
2,Superficial,"I was expecting ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" (a far superior book), but I got information which was probably lifted off of the pages of the New York Times. I heard the author on NPR and thought the book sounded great, especially after he talked up all of the in-depth interviewing he did with Hanssens family. I am pretty dissapointed."
2,Not What You Might Expect,"I bought this book expecting to read about how the FBI investigated Robert Hannsen, as well as the ""cloak and dagger"" aspects like the tradecraft he used and his interactions with his KGB handlers.Instead I found that about half of the book is about Louis Freeh and his ascention to the Directorship, and his accomplishments and failures along the way.Don't waste your money, borrow it from the library."
2,"A Striking, Compelling Dust Jacket...","Surely David Vise will exclude this anemic effort from his heretofore impressive professional portfolio. I echo the sentiments of several customer reviewers who accurately observe The Bureau And The Mole is long on opinion, weakly drawn conclusions and pop psychology, and short on documented fact. No doubt to compensate for a dearth of substance as to how and why Robert Hanssen did what he did, Mr. Vise sloppily weaves in a parallel biography of former FBI Director Louis Freeh which, while mildly interesting, only serves to distract and detract from what should have been a compelling narrative on the most dastardly spy in US history. A story this big and complex warrants a far more serious effort than that put forth in this altogether disappointing book."
1,Unfocused,This book was unfocused and the authors' method of paralleling the careers Robert Hanssen and FBI Director Louis Freeh failed miserably. Robert Hanssen began spying for the Soviets long before Freeh became Director and the mistake is compounded by detailing the fued between Freeh and then-President Bill Clinton in excruciating detail. For a more detailed story look to other books.
2,Poor writing,"I expected a lot from this book and was disappointed. The book is a strong example of a great topic with a horrible delivery. Hanssen betrayed our country' secrets and the best the author can do is bore us with how Louis Freeh should be our hero. After finishing the book I was struck by the feeling that the author had not done much research, as there was little substantive information about Hanssen's spying. It would have been more aptly titled, ""A short book in praise of Louis Freeh""."
1,garbage,"Did I just spend $(...) dollars for this. This book simply fails to deliver. It spends little time exploring the life and psyche of Philip Hansen, and dwells on useless filler. It provides us with a rather detailed sycophantic account of Louis Freeh. It juxtaposes this idealized picture of Louis Freeh to the dual, hypocratical, and deceitful Hanssen. This is supposed to give this book a pseudointellectual flavor, but instead it bores the reader and falls short on delivering the biography of the worst spy in American history. Lastly the appendix describing the sexual fantasies of Philip Hansen is an egregious move on the part of the author. It does not add to the already incomplete and shallow account AND it also victimizes innocent family members."
2,Bob Hanssen or Louis Freeh?,The writer describes former FBI Director Freeh's accomplishments more than Hanssen's. There were at the most 4 chapters regarding Hanssen's traitorous activities.I was very disappointed in the book.
5,ILLUMINATING,"I have wanted to read one of the books about Hanssen, but kept getting conflicting reviews about which was the best book.....So I saw this in paperback, realized I had hesitated long enough, bought it, and read it. It is very illuminating as to the reasons Hanssen is the way he is--for the most part an inept jerk, though scholarly intelligent. I will read another of book on Hanssen, because there is probably much more than is reported here. Though I found the alternating chapters about Freeh interesting, I felt they were fillers and really had no place in this book. Still, the book held my attention all the way through, and so I will give it 5 stars even though it left me wanting more."
2,Disappointing,"The Bureau and the Mole isn't the book it should have been. I'd been hoping for the inside story and lots of juicy details. And there is some inside story and there are some juicy details. But there's lots of dime-store psychoanalysis that is repetitive and not very illuminating. There's as much - if not more - about Louis Freeh to the detriment of details about the espionage aspect of the story. And the bottom line is that the writing just isn't very good. I wish I had better things to say - I'd heard big things about this book and was eager to read it. In the end, though, it was quite a letdown."
3,A lightweight Book,"This book is, unfortunately, full of puff and non-topic filler. The subject is fascinating, but the writing rambels into several irrelevant areas. Perhaps only 50% of the book actually deals with Hanssen. If it's Hanssen and his misdeeds you want to learn about, try a different book."
2,Two Stars,"I agree with those who thought the book was a rush job. It so disconjointed and messy that its hard to read. The author tends to jump back and forth a lot or go off topic even like the Oklahoma bombing which would be intereting if that was what I was reading about. You do get a clear view of what a creepy dude Hanssen was and wonder why the FBI dropped the ball when his brother in law told them Hanssen was a spy back in 1990. The Russians were more amusing in how they made sure to include ""thank yous"" and ""good work"" for the creep."
4,Why the Death Penality Should be Used for Traitors,"Dave Vise's Book ""The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History"" is a good chronology on the actions of one of the worst government employee that this country has ever had. It is not difficult to read and really makes you wonder on why people who can sell out their friends, their families, and their country have any reason to be left living."
2,Too small,"For the state of Texas, which is huge, this is too small to be very useful. Lamination and foldability are nice."
2,Another poorly made opera video,"Yes, I must agree with David Cady. This bad habit of producing opera videos with careless post synching is a serious problem about which film producers are remarkably careless. I've worked in the music and film business all my life and know that this lack of care is simply intolerable and unnecessary. Opera is not a naturalistic medium, and any attempt to make it so by re-setting it out doors, in the wrong acoustic setting (such as this Bohème), or acting as if the singers are not singing but in a play, is risible. It is hard to believe that professionals such as Karajan and Zeffirelli should have allowed this to happen. The Domingo/Freni Butterfly is even worse. A great musical performance ruined by an inept video production. Other similar mis-matches would include Glyndebourne's fabulous Porgy and Bess and the Decca/Solti Bluebeard's Castle. Horrible post-synching. The list is endless, sadly."
3,Total disagreement with other reviewer,"I absolutely disagree with Robert G. VanStryland from Denton, TX USA and his review of this DVD.I own the Australian, the Zeffereli at the Met 1982 and this one, all three and view them all repeatedly. I disagree with just about every statement made by Mr. Van Stryland. The Australian production is really fresh and totally fun. The Met production with Zeff is beyond beauty, it is a spectacular creation. This one with Ms. Freni? Sorry."
5,Freni Is Mimi,"I like this best of the four I own. The audio isn't good at all. I get to hear the true Mimi in Freni. Mirella Freni is truly a great singer and it's sad that the audio is the way it is. But that still can't make me subtract any stars because I love her performance so much. Please remaster this DVD and put it out properly. I know I would buy it again. Also buy,Fedora,Don Carlo,Carmen and Ernani with Mirella Freni."
3,La Boheme,"It arrived on time and in perfect condition. I am a bit disappointed, however, with the sound quality. I am not sure if my old equipment is a contributing factor to the poor sound quality, though."
4,"Well made, light yet solid","PROs:This tripod was lighter than I expected (a plus) yet good and stiff when locked-in place, in part due to the locking spreaders. No wobbles, nothing loose. Carries a Nikon D5100 DSLR with a 200mm telephoto lens without difficulty. The 6 leg-locking mechanisms feel solid; the ""fluid-action"" of the horizontal pan-head is smooth but a bit stiffer than I prefer, probably due to the type of grease used, or because of the cold weather. In all, a very useful, lightweight tripod that can bear weight well, and does not feel flimsy at all, at a good price.CONs:The detachable camera-connector mechanism is all-plastic, and although it snap-locks in place, and is secure, there is the nagging question as to how long the mechanism will work reliably. Probably for years, but it's hard to tell. The crank-centerpost raising mechanism is a bit stiff and hard to operate easily."
2,Cheap,"I found this tripod in an old box, apparently from my early film SLR days of 15 years ago. It's all plastic. It wobbles. The head is difficult to adjust and is never level. It finally fell over, and the head snapped right off. I shed a single tear, then tossed it in the dumpster."
3,broken cookies,"the cookies are good.my only 'complaint' is that almost every package i have opened has had broken cookies in it. it's really no big thing, just a little annoying to have to watch all the time to be sure you don't drop a piece. otherwise the cookies themselves are fine."
2,Lorna Doone-Shortbread Cookies,"I have been wating to try this for a long time now, hearing such great things about this cookie. I hear that they are soo good, and they are the best ever. I was excited to try them, and when I did was I let down. They are not that great, they taste so artificial and lack in major taste. These in no way taste like shortbread ata ll, they taste like a cookie that barbie would make with fake ingredients. I would not waste your money on them until you buy a small amount at the store to try first."
2,"Mediocre and muddled, despite a promising setting and cast.","I was impressed by some of the historical detail and entertained by the setting and some of the sleazy Vegas characters but mostly I felt dissapointed. The last 40 pages are a convoluted mess and the ""big secret"" that was alluded to all along turned out to be a dissapointing dud straight from a bad parody of a Fellini film.But Flemming does have a good writing style and I did care about most of the characters for a majority of the narrative.Definitely undone by ""Third Act Problems""."
3,This is a workbook!,This is a student workbook. The pages are perforated to be removed. I purchased this book for my 6 year old whom I home school. I don't fully understand Base 10 mathematics myself so I needed help teaching him. This book does not give explanations it just gives instructions to follow in order to complete the worksheets problems. We haven't started using it yet but I suspect it is closer to a third or fourth grade level.
4,Quietly Tense,"I cannot imagine a more believable entry into low level mafia errand boy than this. I would have liked it better if he pursued the wads of cash, instead of having it forced on him. However, once inside it's a subtle poison spider web that Cagney and Bogart only hinted at. Crime is less flashy here than most films."
1,I couldn't watch the whole movie,"This has to be the slowest, most meaningless and most worthless movie I have ever watched.Good actors wasted their time and talents on this disaster of a film.I could only wonder why the actors accepted roles in this disaster.I'm only happy that I did not see this awful movie in the theater or I would have been very upset over a ruined evening. I would have walked out in the middle of the movie, upset.I watched the BluRay again later and discovered I was correct the first time.However, I should have quit the first watch five or ten minutes into the movie, since it never got any better, and I never should have tried to watch it a 2nd time. First impression was correct.This DVD went into the trash as I'd be far too embarrased to give it to anyone."
1,too artsy for me,"As much as I like James Franco as an actor I can only give this movie 1 star. I assume acting in a movie like this is much more difficult than acting in a fast paced thriller. But in my opinion this movie is slow, boring, with endless close ups of the actors. It is not a movie someone would want to watch after a hard day at work when all you want is some relaxation and entertainment. Unfortunately I think watching Shadows and Lies is a waste of time."
5,"Excellent movie, but not for everyone.","When I ordered this movie, I was expecting an action packed film. This was not the case. It was a bit slow for a 'gangster film'. I still enjoyed the movie and I will be watching it again a few more times. I do not think this movie is for everyone because of how slow it is. I would say only true James Franco fans should buy this movie, because they will focus more on the acting of James Franco, than in the movie itself. James Franco's acting is excellent, just as it is in his previous very successful films. It is the rest of the movie that might bore some watchers. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely be watching it again, maybe on rainy days."
4,In Search of Stones by Peck,"The author guides the reader through a 3 week tour of Wales,England and Scotland in search of ancient stones. There is aguided tour through Abercastle to locate a prehistoric monument at Long House Farm known to be a meeting place between heavenand earth. The historic Briggs Flat has a meeting house nearSedber which is the 2nd oldest Quaker community. Glenelg brocksshowcases an historic pre-Roman stone set dated 150BC.South Callanish has a dozen or so of the smaller upright stones.The work is perfect for travellers seeking to view thesefamous stone-based landmarks."
5,dog Feeder,works awesome. size and capacity works excellent for my 70# dog. i did add a piece of metal on the inside to the top mount to avoid a problem that people mentioned after 10yrs of use.
4,Seed/food storage bin,"Works great, very nice, wish it was just a little bigger so I could get 50 lbs. of sunflower seeds in for the birds. It was the only one I could find. I am very satisfied, light but well made."
3,Dog Food Dispenser,"The product is covienant and holds a 40 lb bag of food. We had used a floor standing storage tub but it was space we needed back. My only complaint is the dispenser lever seal design. The food gets wedged in it, wiggling the lever gets it free but food mostly falls in the floor."
2,Great for Ants and Slugs,"I have used this container for a couple of years. It definitely makes it easy to pour food into bowls. As another reviewer said, filling the container is a little awkward, because the handle will not stay closed without any food in the dispenser. This container is NOT air tight, so expect bugs!"
3,Bird Seed Dispenser,"I bought this item to hold the birdseed that I use for our backyard feeding. It works pretty well, but the first one I received went back because it didn't close properly. So I would say that they may not be made all that well.If I had room for a second one, I would buy another, as I think it would be even better for the cat litter."
1,Poor quality control,"Great idea for storage however the handle that allows the food to come out is very poorly made. Does not stay in the closed position after use. This, I would think, would be a very simple thing to check prior to packaging. Will be sending it back."
2,Something's Changed,"VERY DISAPPOINTED....We had one of these dog food bins about 10 years ago (same manufacturer) and it was great.. they have obviously cheapened the entire product, the trap door won't stay shut and the dog food falls out the minute you fill it.. we ended up putting a door latch on the trap door to hold it shut because unfortunately we realized that it was a cheap setup AFTER we mounted it to the wall.."
3,"works as advertised, could be better","The dispenser works pretty much as you would expect, but the plastic is pretty thin. The dispensing handle won't stay up if there's nothing in the container, so refilling it when new or completely empty is a two person or three handed operation, assuming you are pouring a 40 pound bag of dog food into the top.The spout at the bottom is very wide as well, which makes it very difficult to dispense into a measuring cup, or anything smaller than a dog's dish."
5,Pour N Stor is GREAT,"This is second my unit. I had one for cat food, and purchased this one for dog food. I love the ease of use and being able to keep the food neat and clean."
3,"Of interest, but to who?","Andre Gide is an author's author -- winner of the 1947 Nobel Prize in Literature; a favourite of notable scribes like Yukio Mishima and Donald Richie; one of the fathers of the modern confessional autobiography -- but outside of the academy or academia, this doesn't make him an interesting read.Concerned to the point of myopia with the triviality of life -- fleeting thoughts, snatched dreams, fears and asides -- If It Die is akin to reading several hundred pages of arbitrary notes -- a stream of consciousness journal rather than a conscious literary work.Of interest certainly in a few places -- his meetings with Oscar Wilde of particular note -- it is hard nonetheless to recommend this to a reader without a purely academic or literary interest.This is an account of the years before Gide became an accomplished author, and in all honesty, nothing much is accomplished."
3,How do we know it's honest?,"I bought this book to see how this ""literary genius"" described his homosexual epiphany, but was disappointed to find a lot of hokum about his dull and sickly life. (Corydon, his dialectic defense of homosexuality, is even worse.) Other than his belief that dramatic plots don't make honest literature, I don't see the connection between Gide and philosophy. I seriously doubt that he knew anything about philosophy and cared only about writing convoluted fictional narratives. In this book he confesses that his main aim was to become a famous writer. He couldn't for the life of him tell a straight story. It's all innuendo sprinkled with touching emotions. Is this honesty? Phooey! The real title is Unless the Seed Dies, referring to John 12:24 on being born again. His seed died and so did his life."
4,A gripping read,"I grew up listening to my parents talk about Harry Truman and the 1948 election. No one thought Truman had a chance and everyone went to bed believing Tom Dewey would be the next President. But everyone was wrong, from the reporters who covered the campaign, to H.V. Kaltenborn, the famous radio announcer of that era, to the new political pollsters. All were left with egg on their faces when Truman won over 300 electoral votes and swept to victory.This book demonstrate the importance of the farm vote switching mightily to Truman as the campaign wore on, and how Dewey was impossibly arrogant and stopped active campaigning on mid-October, thinking he had the election sewn up! Most of all, this is a tribute to the plucky Harry Trumam, who never conceded, never doubted he would win, and throughout his famous whistle-stop tour, gave 'em hell. A stirring account of a great campaign."
5,Two Thumbs up for this great teaching tool!,"I manage an office of 70 lawyers that needed team building skills, but have a deep scepticism about the usual drills. I found this book to be clearly written, well organized and easy to adapt to my training needs. We used several of the games at a recent office retreat to great success. I strongly recommend Games That Teach Teams to anyone who wants to get their team to work, and play, better."
4,Essentials of Behavioral Research,"This book arrived prior to the estimated date of arrival in great condition. It is useful for upper level graduate students in psychology, especially if you are planning on conducting a meta-analysis. However, I have yet to use this text for the class that I purchased it for. It is also useful for planning the design of your research, but again I have yet to use this text since I am just beginning my graduate career."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"My background in statistics was not very helpful to understand this awfully soporific, pedantic book : it inflicts on you hundreds of references pages after pages. Not a single chapter is ended with exercises. To my misfortune I had it as a mandatory textbook in an Information System course at NJIT -- imposed by an unscrupulous ""distinguished professor"", whose background is sociology, as a favor to the authors, apparently."
4,Good Read,THis book is about woodsie and the new Wolfbay Wings. The year before this they were the best team in half the country. No one is more suprised when Woodsie makes the team this year. The former coach has left and taken the five best players with him. Woodsie knows that he is going to get bugged at summer camp but can everyone just get along and win hockey. You have to see.
5,"If you like jazz fusion, you'll want this CD","I own this CD and I have given this CD as gifts to people and the first thing everyone has said is, I love their version of ""I can see clearly now"". This CD is great to listen to while driving or just hanging out at home. The rhythems are tight as the band blends musical genres. Just give this CD a listen and you will be hooked on this band."
3,not THAT bad...but...,"Seeing people make love while skiing down the side of a mountain is great to jack to, but I found the story rather lackluster. The main character was completely unbelievable, and I found myself knowing exactly what was going to happen next, as the plot was simple and routine as far as porns go. I only suggest this to avid fans of skiing, mountains, and sex."
3,i like k's choice,"the k's choice extra cocoon cd is not very long, and although they contain b-sides and remixed or acoustic versions of songs, most of them are mediocre at best. k's choice's cover of the tom waits song, ""ol' 55"", sounds too country. ""julian"" is too sappy and a bit slow. but the high point and the only track that stands out is the beautiful b-side ""try to get some sleep"". however if ur a k's choice fan, the reason to get this is not for the music. its a wonderful interactive cd-rom, which includes great behind the scene video clips. and also has the complete music video of ""not an addict"". theres also other surprises. so get this cd if ur a hardcore k's choice fan, but don't get it if u simply liked ""not an addict"", because its not worth the import price."
4,Eco-friendly and works well,"I first saw this product at a ""Green fair."" It does a very good job cleaning floors, including spills and scuff marks (when paired with the Bona microfiber cleaning cloth.BonaKemi AX0003005 Microfiber Floor Cleaning Cloth, Twin Pack). It also drys fairly quickly and does not have the harsh smell that other cleaners have. The only drawback is the need to spray either the floor or the mop head repeatedly as you go through the room. I believe Bona remedied this issue with their new product line."
2,Same as everything else,"I bought this product because I was told that you HAVE to use it to clean the type of floor I have, you can use nothing else. I did a part of the floor side by side with my old standby that I use for everything - Mr. Clean and honestly, there is no difference. Well, unless you consider the difference in price. I am just careful to not let the mop be too wet because supposedly too much water can damage the floor, or make the tiles come up. For my money, I'll stick with what's worked for years and costs a lot less."
2,disappointing,"I was so looking forward to this due to the reviews as being the best ever used, well let me tell ya, it streaks on laminate just like the rest, not too happy with it"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This product cleans about as well as water. Of course it's environmentally friendly, water is too. Doesn't leave any residue because water doesn't leave residue. I am dumping it down the drain. Ended up with an expensive spray bottle I can reuse."
3,Good but......,"No cigar here. Hate to disagree with the other reviewer but it's not most are 12"" singles.Don't You Want Me? notIt's My Life? notThe Look Of Love? notTemptation? notWe Close Our Eyes? notToo Shy? notWouldn't It Be Good? not (track I bought to replace my 12"" record)Nowhere Girl? notVicious Games? notO L'Amour, 2 minutes 50 seconds? NOTNever Ending Story? notTalk About? notThe Night? a remix, an edit at the wonderful time at 3:09! Which is really sad since I have the 12"" single on ""blanco y negro""A Few Highlights:Blue Monday 12""Smalltown Boy 12""Gold 12""Tainted Love Suite 12""Dance Hall Days 12""Letter From My Heart 12"" tecno pop? replaced the bad pressing that the label left on the intro. A Treasure but out of place with these tracks.Relax 12""Vienna 12""Steppin' Stone 12"" and a treat to the ears.Overall a nice collection of tracks but far from the 12"" singles that have been known from this label. Nice to collect oldies, but not for true collectors."
4,Nice,"If you like choral music, Szymanowski's Polish work (in Polish) might interest you. I'm glad I tried the music. For me, at least, it failed to measure up to the classics among devotional compositions, including of course Handel's Messiah, and Beethoven's less-well-known Missa Solemnis Catholic mass, among others. Obviously, others disagree, and find this piece incomparable."
1,decent song until the cowboy comes in,The song is OK until the cowboy comes in. It doesn't mix well with the rest of the song. Outkast should rethink how to organize the song and then come out with it again. It will be a good song when they think of a replacement for the cowboy.
1,terrible cd!!!!!!!,"Man, what a waste of time waiting for this one. I love NIN, but this is more like a depressing slow song cd. And when the songs do begin to get heavy (which are few and far between) they sound like they should be on the top 40 pop countdown. I was extremely dissapointed by this cd. I know it is hard to try to create another one like the downward spiral, but with as much time that he worked on this one it should have been pretty close to it. Sorry Trent but you really let me down!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Come on...,"Dave Grohl? the Collector? come on, this guy sucks now.. maybe if you took an original idea instead of ripping off Skinny Puppy on your first cd, you might have actually been able to stretch your talent out through to this cd. Oh and the whole ""i am so cool i will make you wait for seven years before you see another cd from me.. haa haa haaha haa!!!"" makes you suck even more.. god... man.. Do we have any industrial left? not if this crap keeps coming out..."
3,Expected more......,"I waited patiently,and kinda feel let down.THe cd isn't bad,but it isn't great either.And I am a long time fan.I can't quite put my finger on what isn't right,could be it's more stripped down.The songwriting is superb as always.Could be I just got spoiled by the fragile.But needless to say it's worth getting,I'm sure in time it will grow on me."
3,disappointing,"not too bad, but, sadly, not too good either. this album has some pretty interesting music, but the lyrics are boring and i really dislike the 'song-oriented' approach. after listening to this, all i could think was ""that's all? i waited 6 years for this??"""
5,The Best Nails Yet!,"I've heard pretty much every track from this album in it's entirety, and I can tell you all without the B.S., that this is by far Trent's best offering to date!From the mellow 'Home' to the deep/crunch 'The Line Begins To Blur' this is the one to set the bar for 2005."
4,Great DVD-A,"Yes, the DVD side of this album also has DVD-A as well as an AC-3 surround track in the DVD-V portion. This isn't mentioned in Amazon's technical details (Dual Disc doesn't require DVD-A), so if you are looking for this excellent album on DVD-A, this is it.The CD side is a bit of false advertising in my opinion. While Dual Disc claims only a ""limited number"" of CD players won't play the CD side of a Dual Disc, this includes my main 2 channel system's Sony C555ES CD/SACD player and most of my computers (which have recent DVD/CD-ROM drives). No playback on my 2 channel system. So it look like I have to get both this for the DVD-A and the CD version for my other systems, contrary to the goal of what a Dual Disc is supposed to offer.Don't buy this expecting it to play in your CD player."
5,Trent keeps getting better and better.,"The wait is over, and it was worth it. Full of all the great lyrics and hard hitting music we all know and love,this is Trents' most polished and solid album yet. Yes, it does have it's share of slower stuff at times, but just give it two or three listens before you say it is not good and give it a one star review. As a NIN fan for the last ten years , I know I am going to enjoy this album for a long time to come."
5,Innovative and captivating!,If you are a lover of NINs earlier works only this may not be for you. I love the innovation and surprises in this album! Only is one song that I just can't get out of my head!
5,Fresh Industrial Madness,"I have been a fan since Pretty Hate Machine and Trent Reznors' progression through time is amazing. His music is well written, catchy and pure. This CD comes at a great time. The rock and pop world are so dull and boring, this CD brings music back to life. I would recommend this CD if you want a kick of hard rock/industrialmadness in your butt. NIN puts on a great show as well. Keep em coming Trent, the music world needs you."
4,NIN - With Teeth,"Nine Inch Nails' newest album With Teeth was a great return to the music world for them. Though the album is a bit different from their earlier CDs, the new sound is still good. From the driving beats of the singles ""The Hand That Feeds"" and ""Only"" to the harder edgier sound of ""Getting Smaller"", this CD is all a NIN fan could have hoped for after their 6 year break. Some of the other, more industrial-like tracks, are reminiscent of the album The Downward Spiral, a favorite among many fans. Though some of the songs on the album are a bit dull and repetitive, the good certainly outweighs the bad. It's not their best album, but I think that With Teeth was a great effort at a new sound that pleases old fans and new ones as well."
3,Generally uninspired.,"Although I am a NIN fan, I found With Teeth to be generally uninspired and lacking the edge normally found on Reznor's albums. The CD is worth having is you are a collector or if you like the softer side of NIN."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!,"PLEASE,.....You must listen to Right Where It belongs, it's the most beautiful song on this cd. If you need a song that makes you think about your life or any situation you're going through, then this is th song."
2,Deeply Disappointed,"""With Teeth"" is a very strange title for this record, as it has none. It simply doesn't have the raw edge of all of his previous work. This morning I listened to this and then followed it with Pretty Hate Machine, just to get a direct comparison. PHM is *much* more lyrically and musically interesting and involving. You can tell that there was a lot of emotion that went into PHM, whereas ""With Teeth"" just doesn't feel like he put as much of himself into it, and none of the tracks have the musical complexity of past releases. There simply aren't as many or as interesting layers of sound in it. Makes me sad, because I've been a NIN fan for a long time, seen them live, was an awesome show, but next time they come through, I hope the live show avoids the new material..."
3,"Meh, it's not *that* bad I guess...","I'm not feeling this album as well as I felt TDS and The Fragile. Perhaps I was hoping it would be more meditative, and less dancey/poppy. Even the songs that are supposed to sound a bit harsh and dark seem to be lacking a certain element of nihilism or something. I could go on about the aspects that I don't like, but the main fact is that I'm just not feeling any strong emotions from these songs. The album isn't completely awful though... just kind of mediocre and unexciting."
3,"Really, what is the point?","If this had come out fifteen years ago, it would be earthshaking, but things change, and Trent hasn't. You can't just continue to beat the same drum.Ah well, it's not like very many artists have managed it, most plow some new ground and then just go back over it again and again until they're on the retro circuit. Coming up with really new music is the hardest thing on earth. Name a group, aside from a bizarre fluke like the Bee Gees, that started off on top and came back to stand there again? Doesn't happen."
1,Pzzzt!,"Those of us who've followed this band since the inception are disgraced. However, there are two radio hits for those who love to chew bubblegum."
1,this is crap,"My Friend got ""with teeth"", and i burned it just to listen to it for a couple of weeks to see if i wanted to buy it. What a mistake. This whole album is crap, and i can't believe i wasted a dollar on a cd to burn this piece of garbage. If i could, i would give this album a 0 star. Never buy this album"
2,With Teeth is a parody of Downward Spiral,"The first time I tuned in on FUSE and saw the new ""Hand that Feeds"" video, I caught it near the end of it. At first, I thought the band was a bad NIN rip-off. But then I realized that the guy mired behind the increasingly-distorted digital effects and cliched screaming was infact Trent Reznor... again. This guy's in such a damn rut. He hasn't done anything unique since 94's Downward Spiral. He's milked that album for the past eleven years. With great success I might add. After all, there HAS to be an audience for this watered-down digital bullsh*t that Depeche Mode perfected by the time they'd finished their Violator tour in 1990, right? With a title that calls itself ""With Teeth"", this album is just asking for people to slam it. Let's see how many plays on the title we can come up with. ""With Teeth"" bites. ""With Teeth"" has no bite to it. Now come up with your own!I want more cutesy synth pop like PTM, Trent."
1,Anti Piracy encoding too intrusive.,"I could not get the CD side of this Dual disc to play in my computer, or stanard CD players including my original SONY CD player from the early 1980s. The DVD side works however works flawlessly."
2,An Unpleasant Suprise,"As a true NIN fan...this album did nothing but disappoint.I'm truly sad.I could get into deep descriptions on why, but it's not necessary. Just listen to a few songs, you'll understand.Why Trent?!?! Why?!?!"
2,Nine Inch Nails is dead !,"The Broken & The Fragile had blown me away. This (with teeth) is nothing short of mediocre. What happened Trent? What were you thinking man? Either you are losing touch with all things musical or you are simply too deafened by your own rants about how bad all the music is out there. You seem to be falling into that very category that you so arduously created in order make people believe that you are the greatest thing in music. It worked for a while, but its clear now that you are NO genius but only play one on TV. Good show man !"
2,I miss old NIN,I miss old NIN. This is the first time I've actually been ashamed to blast a NIN album. Somewhere between Trent's high-pitched chanting and obnoxious dance beats I decided that NIN just wasn't hitting the spot anymore.
2,Dissappointed fan,"I have been a huge Nine Inch Nails fan for years so it's hard to give this CD a bad review, but I will. On a positive note the CD is straight to the point and I'm sure the songs will sound great live because of the lack of extra electronic sounds, however it sounds like the whole CD was thrown together. Trent's lyrics at times seem quite jumbled and sometimes he sounds like he's singing in a garage. A matter of fact, major portions of the CD sound like it was made by a garage band. Many fans will hype up this CD but I feel that this is the one CD that doesn't need to be in your Nine Inch Nails collection."
4,"""sunspots cast a glare in my eyes""","My opinion is this is a good summer album, despite some generic tunes and recycled lyrics. At least they're catchy, and kept me busy for a pretty long while without getting to the point of overkill. I like that it's more song-oriented than The Fragile anyway. Trent can do songwriting and mixing like nobody else, and he's not the greatest singer but he has his own thing down pat. In this genre, I can excuse the lyrics. If it's something I can rock in my car to, then I'm probably not going to be giving a whole lot of thought to the lyrics, anyway. It would still be worth getting just to hear the immense soundscapes.fyi ~ I'm not under 13. I posted this a long time ago but it never got processed."
3,Always falling down the same hill.,"If you like Nine Inch Nails then you will probably like this album. I like this album, BUT I'd like for Trent to show me something different, something new, something a bit more challenging. I don't know, maybe it's time for him to do an acoustic album and then he can concentrate on better songwriting. It just seems like I've heard this all before and before it was just a little bit better."
2,NIN is done!!!!,"I have loved NIN for many years now and I was pretty happy to see this album come out. BUT I hate to say it sucks pretty bad. Trents ""I'm a dark depressed loser"" act has run it's course!! With the teethuhhhhhhhhhh it the worst NIN song I have ever heard!!! Also, stop with the DUALDISC CRAP!!! make one damn cd then stop! It's just a lame way to make money on a lame album!! Also, good ol trent just rematered the the downward spiral cd too. WHY???? Isnt that the whole point of cd's? so the sound is digital audio from the start?? Don't be fooled. I did give this 2 stars because I love RIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS, but other then that this cd blows. Keep your eye out for the re-mix of this junk, I'm sure it's on the way too!"
1,Very dull.,"I thought Nine Inch Nails was a band that had an edge to their sound, something that made you sit up and listen.Not anymore, forget this and get ""Downward Spiral"" and ""The Fragile"""
5,TRENT DID IT AGAIN!!!,"If you are a fan of nin,get your hands on this one because you won't be disappointed after the long wait..."
3,Now Im Nothing,Same Trent Reznor.. It was great back in the day but nothing really crazy on this one.. It does have a few good songs though.. If you like lots of distortion this is the cd for you! I think the closer days are gone.. Maybe Im getting old...
2,Damn that's a good Saltine,"For anyone who's seen Eddie Murphy's comedy...a person goes so long without something (ie. food, music), diehard fans of NIN will listen and say...mmmm...yeah!! that's the best damn NIN i've heard in years.Truth be told...If this is what Trent has come up with in 6 years...oh dear!!If this was NIN first album...very good..but it's not."
3,Get The Greater Wrong of the Right By Skinny Puppy Instead,It seems to me like he's trying to recapture some retro flavor in this release. The way it's recorded and the sound he's going for sounds kind of 80's retro. I just don't like this as much as earlier NIN releases because each one seemed to move forward and take unique directions. Because of all of these groups right now that are trying to recapture the 80's sound it just doesn't sound as unique as a NIN release should be. Get the new Skinny Puppy CD instead. That sounds pretty unique in comparison to this and that's one of Trent's major influences anyway.
2,2 stars for 2 songs,"This album is not good at all. I can not believe people compare it to Pretty Hate Machine, no NIN album is comparable to PHM, especially this one. The good songs I thought were #2 and #6, the last one was ok, but nothing stood out in it to make me remember it and want to listen to it again. Number 8 just makes me lose all faith in Trent. This album, and any other NIN album will live up to Pretty Hate Machine, but if your into nowadays music then you'll probably like it, but for oldschool fans, this sucks."
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited for this release. I thought I would love whatever it was, it's NIN! It's OK. It's not great, not bad, but really just ok is not what I was hoping for. I'll hold on to my true NIN cds, and just let this one mark the official end."
2,sad...,"well, i live in japan and the cd came out a month before it was released in the states... i wish i could have warned anybody about getting this cd because it is truly sad. i wasn't expecting another broken or the downward spiral and definately another fragile (which was also sad by the way). it's just not up to par with what i think reznor can actually do. what happened to orginality? anyways, the japanese release came out with three bonus tracks that are by far way better than the first thirteen tracks that came out on the u.s. version and that's the only reason why i gave this two stars."
4,Better than the Fragile,"This the the album for those NIN fans that couldn't force themselves to like The Fragile. It has some Fragile-like sounds, but it is mainly the old school NIN we grew up loving. I'm liking it more every time I listen."
1,WOW!!! What a....,"crappy cd! whoa nine inch nails sucks... their music is like hmm hard to explain... well any way i put it ill just end up saying this cd along with their other is trash. now about the backwards n on half their merchandise (Grade A crap if you ask me)they MIGHT wanna fix that. i learned to write N's correctly long ago. so if these juniors wanna sell, they better step up and start playin better... or step aside and let better bands earn that extra .00000001% money that nin is taking away. Ill put the same thing on a slipknot cd - just replace the nine inch nails/nin with slipknot and backwards n with holoween costume"
1,Boring as usual,"I tryed to give this album a listen but GOOD GOD DID THIS SUCK. I already heard the horrible bite the hand that feeds you bite the hand that feeds you bite the hand...oh sorry, I got repetitive..probably from that damn song. I was never much a die hard fan so when this album came out I said ""Hmm, maybe I will have a looksey"". Boy what a fricken nightmare! Lame and boring."
2,What's the Deal with this band?,"Yeah their stuff sounds cool, but for me, one CD of it is enough. I mean, With Teeth is basically the same CD that they realeased what, 5 years ago? The only real stand-outish track is the single, ""Hand that Bleeds."" The rest are all just kinda ehhh...If you want to get into really good industrial-type metal, then check out Tool."
5,"Very interesting, considering Trent is sober now","This is a good entry-level disc for the novice NIN fan and a well-waited for album for the hardcore fans who have been waiting for a little under 6 years for new stuff. (6 years!!)Some of the songs have that dance-type sensibility to them... which will either make you want to smash the CD or dance along wildly. It depends on what kind of NIN fan you are.Overall, this CD's got a good blend to it. Kinda reminds me of PHM (Pretty Hate Machine), but with more instruments."
4,A hitfilled adventure,"This album was a comeback of sorts. After the amazing, yet poor selling The Fragile, Trent needed a hit. Much like the Velvet Underground did with Loaded, he churned out a lean mean album, chock full of hits. Unfortunately, by doing so, he lost the depth and intelligence of previous albums. While I've listened to this a ton, it's usually more for the singles than for the entire album. As such, your opinion of the album depends on the type of music goer you may be. While some perfer the entire album effect, others are in it solely for the singes. This album is for those who like catchy songs, surrounded by industrial music."
4,"Hey, he's branching out...","No, it's not the best Nine Inch Nails record, (although I feel like ranking an artist's work is futile and silly.) It's a good, solid rock record, very focused on sticking a few songs to you and getting out of town. The more organic ""band"" approach is refreshing, and some of these songs are meaner sounding than anything Trent's done previously. The layers of guitar in ""Know what you are"" and ""Getting Smaller"" are absolutely stunning, and deserve to be heard on a huge stereo. (The thought of people MP3ing this record for tiny headphones seems tragic.) Overall, I really enjoyed this record, and have no idea why some people complain about it. He already made ""The Downward Spiral"" & ""The Fragile"", let the man do what he wants."
1,almost 6 years for this?,"This album only has 1 truly amazing song and that is the first single the hand that feeds. The rest was like what was that? In a bad way. It makes you think wow I waited almost six years for this? The first song all the love in the world is half a good song, the second half is good the first half is like what was that crap? Another one beside you in time, once again the second half of that song is good, the first half was like what is this crap. Do yourself a favor and listen to this before you buy it or simply buy the hand that feeds single with the remixes which are good. This is only the second time ever one of my favorite bands who has never come out with crap music, finally put out crap music. The first was fear factory with their latest album archetype."
3,Better than I expected,"I was prepared to give up on NIN after being bored by THE FRAGILE and by the long spans in between albums. But WITH TEETH actually has me interested again. Most of the reviewers here are correct in pointing out that this album sounds like a post-FRAGILE version of PRETTY HATE MACHINE. If you're old enough to remember that fun and sometimes lame album than you will probably enjoy WITH TEETH. It's definitely not a masterpiece in the way that THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL is. Hell, how many bands have multiple masterpieces this day and age? Hopefully Reznor will release another album in the next year as some have suggested so that WITH TEETH won't have to stand out in the open for too long. It's not strong or complex enough to keep new fans, or old fans that had given up, interested for an extended period of time."
1,KILL ME! KILL ME! KILL ME!,"I am an avid fan of Nine Inch Nails. And simply put this is the most worthless album next to an avril lavigne album. I am no music connoiseur. Not even sure if i spelled that right. But comparatively, Trent Reznor has gone into a downward spiral musically. PHM was the best album ever. Broken followed it up with its brashness. The Downward Spiral expanded into concept territory as none before. The Fragile awed me with its melodies. With Teeth is an album unworthy of NiN. It sounds like Reznor got up one day and said, ""Hey guys. You know what. I got an idea. Lets give up our roots and copy what everyone else is doing now. Only lets throw in some weird melodies half these other idiots never thought of."" That's all this album is. And I like Trent Reznor, the old Reznor, so that's really hard for me to say, but it is true."
2,NIN no more,"Trent once said that he would loose his job if he went and saw a psycologist (yes he actually said that!) and I think its time he does what he said. Everybody who likes it are his ""new"" genre, who aren't aware of his old achivements, that he was once a genre by himself. Now he is another rock-star, an entertainer, who is pickpocketing us to keep his luxirous life alive, like Marilyn Manson. Thats all he is trying to do.. Ripping the adult people who buy the image, rather than the music. I have always believed in him, I loved every single song of him, I didn't download his songs but bought original CDs because I thought he deserved it. But not anymore. I am not gonna listen his junk anymore. They aren't gonna rip my $$ anymore."
3,"""With Teeth"" doesn't bite.","This is an album I find sounds somewhat like all their previous albums rolled into one. In a way that should make it the best disc, but in another way it simply recalls something we've heard before. There are no mind-blowing songs to my ears, no metal ala ""Broken"", and ""The Hand That Feeds"" and ""Only"" are indeed the catchiest of what's here. However, I still really like it, and ""With Teeth"" is a move in the right direction after the bloated ""The Fragile"". The Dualdisc version of this is simply the ""Hand That Feeds"" video, a discography with some samples, and the album mixed in stereo and surround. Nothing I need myself. Overall, if this was NIN's only disc I'd call it excellent, but when compared to their other albums it's simply good."
2,Not worth the wait,"I keep hoping NIN will release something as great as BROKEN or THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL or even PRETTY HATE MACHINE, or if not then go somewhere new. Reznor's obviously an incredibly talented musician. And to be fair, SPIRAL was one of the best albums of the 90s, so he's set the bar very high. Now he has a tough decision to make: try to top SPIRAL and fall short more often than not, or try a new direction altogether. WITH TEETH is the former. The same layered, angry, self-loathing stuff as SPIRAL, just not as good. A few decent tracks, but overall a letdown."
4,Pump Up,"This ablum serves a great purpose of pumping me up on the ride work. What better way to start the day on the stinky subway than ""The Hand that Feeds"" blasting on the iPOD? It's almost as good as ""The Wretched"" which is still be best NYC Subway song..."
4,It is what it is,"I dont believe this record can be compared to any of his others, or you'd have to compare each individual part to a different record, which really means it ISNT like any of his records. As with the [Collected] DVD it seems maybe this is a turning point, a recollection on previous times, it is definately nothing new, but it is a firm mix of what has done before, both by NIN and by hit songs--which by this I mean to say I see it as a more mainstream album, hell and I say good for him, he deserves money for what he does, and what he has made here is art, it's not him just whining about things, and it's not him directly copying formulas, he doesn't try anything new, but he blends them together soo well you can't see the individual fruits of his efforts in this smoothie of a record. Solid, with promise and a new feel to it, this record is worth the money you'll put down on it, which has been quite reasoneable."
3,"""With Teeth"" doesn't bite.","This is an album I find sounds somewhat like all their previous albums rolled into one. In a way that should make it the best disc, but in another way it just recalls something we've heard before. There are no mind-blowing songs to my ears, no metal ala ""Broken"", and ""The Hand That Feeds"" and ""Only"" are indeed the catchiest of what's here. However, I still like it, and ""With Teeth"" is the right direction after the bloated ""The Fragile"". The DVD is simply ""The Hand That Feeds"" video, a discography with some samples, and stereo and surround mixes of the album. Nothing I really need to see more than once. Overall, if this was NIN's only disc I'd call it excellent. But when compared to their other albums it's simply good."
5,Deserves alot more recognition,"When an artist makes a cd and especially if they go in a totally new direction which in my opinion reznor did with this Cdyou have to give some credibility for taking such a risky decision.On top of that Trent Reznor isn't as pissed as he used to be...which necessarily doesn't mean its a bad thing but an eye openerand a door to new things to come..This cd is just the begginning in my opinion of the best yet to comeNIN has always surprised everyone and I seriously disagree with those that say they have lost their edge or aren't as hard as they arecause if you go see them live like I did this yrs at ""With Teeth"" tour you'll realize that they're back even harder and betterI honestly think the new line-up is excellent and Trent still gots it."
2,MAYBE IN TIME IT'LL BE BETTER,"i'M JUST NOT FEELING THIS CD! I HAVE LOVED EVERY TRACK TRENT HAS PUT OUT IN THE PAST. MOST OF THEM RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THIS ONE I'M NOT FEELING YET. THERE'S MAYBE 3 SONGS THAT ARE REALLY STAND OUT TRACKS. NOT YET READY TO TRADE IT IN, I COULD NEVER DO THAT TO TRENT EVEN IF HE PUT OUT A COUNTRY CD. THE FRAGILE TOOK A LITTLE TIME TO GROW ON ME SO MAYBE THIS WILL TOO. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY HARDCORE NIN FANS"
4,"Great album, could have been DARKER","This is definitely one of the most ""pop"" type of albums Trent Rezner has come out with. Its not dark like the fragile or broken. Has a lot of 80's retro feel to it which isn't really a bad thing. Overall I like it, but its not his best album by far and I was a little disappointed not hearing any real good ""Angry"" music. But I still love Trent and NIN and I'm looking forward for some remixes of this album!!!Ok well now that I've had some time to fully get used to this album and 1 live NIN concert/tour later. I appreciate this album much better more now. Yes it is different then his other albums but whats wrong with a little change? I think Trent knows his roots and he will get back to them in his next album."
2,Buy The Downward Spiral Deluxe Edition Instead,"After one listen, this cd was HIGHLY disappointing! I regret buying the album and after a few more listens would probably have purchased 3 or 4 songs online (The Collector - best song, You know what you are? - typical yell anthem, Only - great dance, disco song, Right where it belongs - piano ballad, good but not ""Hurt""). The album is incredibly disjointed and doesn't really flow well. Trent is obviously out of things to write about, you'll hear this when he uses lyrics from past albums like ""Nothing can stop me now"" and ""a tiny dot caught my eye"". Plus, there's the brilliant ""Flip, Flop, Flip"" lyrics in ""Getting Smaller"". Fortunately, I bought the Downward Spiral Deluxe Edition and took a trip down memory lane where the lyrics were fresh and full of feeling. One of the biggest fans of Trent Reznor who thought he was a genius is now eating her words."
5,its good,"not as good as TDS (hes too old to outdo his earlier masterpieces), but still very goodbuy it now"
2,With(out) Teeth,"After years of waiting for some new music from Nine Inch Nails, With Teeth is eaily the least interesting Nine Inch Nails Album, and one of the worst big-name Rock albums released in the genre over the past few years. With a few bright spots, the Synth-Pop ""Hand That Feeds"" and the almost too Happy for NIN ""Only,"" With Teeth still fails to get anywhere."
3,What the F*****,"This is still good but not like head banging thrill olympics good. The lyrics are much less refined and eloquent then the older albums. There are still some very good beats but this is certainly not the Nine inch Nails most people identify with. It pretty much carries on the trend of the The Fragile. The only hateful, anti-religious, or mildly obscene songs contain the F-word and no more. A 15 year old can listen and identify with the simplicity of this album, I bet it kicks ass live!"
3,"Not the worst, but not very much of an effort from Trent","Well I am into my 4th spin of this album as i am writing this, and it seems to be an album of quality from Trent Reznor, but nothing new to his credits. It has a few remeberances of the past albums (Starf*ckers Inc. can be heard throughtout a few tracks off the album). As for everyone who is whining about the *pop* tracks on this album, you have to expect some after 15+ years of making music, its just incluence. Overall my two favorite tracks are ""What You Are"" and ""The Line Begins to Blur"". The album isn't as dark as some other ones in the NIN library, but as you listen it definitely gets darker and heavier, with the exception of ""Sunspots"", which is a well designed and written tune, just doesnt fit on a NIN album. Overall a decent effort from Mr. Reznor, but I personally could have asked for more heavy industrialized tunes."
3,nin is back with a asome album,man this album rocks okay not as good as the downward spiral.but it rocks.
1,Why Trent? Why?,"I've loved every halo, single, soundtrack song etc that NIN has put out over the years. This on the other hand. No. I cannot force myself to digest this. All I can say is better luck next time. Basically Trent pulled a St. Anger on us. Yes I use that to describe really bad things these days. That should give you some idea of how bad I think this album is.An artist cannot always produce terrific albums every time, but this could have been better. Much better. The hype was so great but the music is so mediocre. I say buy something else that you don't already have from NIN. Like Still or Things Falling Apart. That way you can bypass the waves of dissapointment."
3,Not that good,"I am a rock fan. I LOVE NIN, System of a Down, etc. But I have to say that this album truely disappointed me. I was hoping for songs more like some on their old albums but they are very low key and not much heavy rock in them. All the songs sound the same and it doesn't sound good at all."
2,"Could be worse, could be much better","Say goodbye to experimentation, to anything new or exciting, or to something else that would leave you wanting more by the end of the album. Trent Reznor is out of ideas. Or maybe inspiration. Half the songs on With Teeth are tired retreads of previous albums, but with LESS bite. Trent has lots of reason to be angry, who doesn't? But don't take it out on the listener, Trent. That's not to say this album is terrible. Fans of Reznor are like starving people at a buffet, they'll go for just about anything. It takes you years to come out with something, Trent, I guess I just expected better."
3,I waited five years for this???,"I love NIN... but this CD is crap. I'm tempted to give it only 2 stars. Why did it take Trent five years to make this? There isn't one track that stands out on this album!! I'm glad I didn't have to buy this CD because then I would have to go through the trouble of reselling it here on amazon. I will continue to listen to the old NIN, which I love deeply- PHM, Downward Spiral, Broken, Fragile......the only people who are going to say they like this album are the people who are denial... they can't admit that Trent blew it on this one.If this is the evolution of NIN- I'll stay stuck in the past... this CD is boring."
2,At last....The weakest NIN album has landed,"I am a huge fan of NIN and always will be. I have to admit that i am very disappointed in this album, no matter what. They are all weak songs, nothing new. I can even say that there are no favourite tracks in this album. Most of them was constructed from the old materials. As i said i will always be NIN fan so i will look for the next album. I am sure they will come back in top form with the album more creative, more structure and hope that trent will co-produce with Flood again !!"
1,Trent has no musical talent whatsoever!,"Trent has given the world 16 years of his terrible music. By now its just time to quit, the world doesn't need this nonsense anymore.For truly talented music stick to Good Charlotte, 50 Cent, Britney Spears, Atreyu, Metallica (Load, reload, st anger) , and Any emo * nu metal band"
1,LAME LAME LAME,"Nine Inch nails are not cool, Gee what year was it 1992. give it up trent, You guys are posers, Yes you are.... Buy Ministry rather then Nine Inch Nails, Cuz Ministry is better"
1,Where art becomes craft...,"Trent Reznor is a talented artist.""The Downward Spiral"" was an instant classic; it still sounds not of its time.""La Mer"" was the only decent track on ""The Fragile"".""With Teeth"" is tired before it even got up.Artists should no longer make ""art"" when they no longer have anything to say. Trent Reznor has become a craftsman."
4,Hells yeah!,"I'm not a very big Nine Inch Nails fan. In my poinion, everything after ""Pretty Hate Machine"" was pretty weak. This album, on the other hand, is effing great! It's strange that I like it so much, because it's not as industrial / electronic as Pretty Hate Machine, or any of thier other records, but something really attracts me to this album. If you're one of those really hardcore industrial types, I wouldn't suggest picking this one up, but if you liked more guitar -driven industrial... This album is for you. Damn... I still don't know why I like it so much...."
4,4.5 stars,"I thought this album was excellent, pure and simple. As an avid NIN fan, I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers in saying, it doesn't quite compare to PHM, TDS or The Fragile. While I thought the Fragile was brilliant, I thought it had a lot of filler on it as well.This album sounds entirely different then NIN but at the same time it's totally NIN. A lot of the songs have a grungy kind of rock style to them, with ""Dont you know what you are?"" really being the only song to get angry too.There's not really that ONE song that stands on this album, but I can honestly say that ""Only"", ""sunspots"" and ""Right where it belongs"" are right up there with some of my favorite NIN songs of all time. Truly brilliant songs in my opinion.Highly recommended if your a true NIN fan and your not expecting every song to sound like ""closer"""
4,"Something old, something new...","All tracks are superb, and Reznor-esque. However, track one of the CD starts like Sting. From there, it's heavy drums, heavy guitar... it's more instrumental (as oppossed to overly-synthesized and mixed)and more lyrical than anything NIN has done to date.If you are a true NIN fan (i.e. since Halo 1) it may take a few spins through the CD palyer to get used to a newer sound, with SOME familiarity (The Hand That Feeds is VERY ""Head Like a Hole""ish.) However, I believe the wait was worth it as Trent has put out the typical well-thought and arranged music his fans have come to know, love, and respect. Not quite ""The Downward Spiral"", but then again, what is???"
4,Good Album.......TRENT ROCKS!!!,"i have always loved NIN but i get sick of waiting for new releases, why does it take 5 years to make a album? anyway, this album is good....i dont think its a Masterpiece but its a good album. i know dave ghrol, who is a AMAZING drummer, did alot of work on this album with the drums. i dont know what songs dave recorded but the drumming on all the songs are great. so i wouldnt be surprised to know dave did all the drumming...and im glad that trent didnt continue the ""downward spiral"" electronical sound and went back to the ""broken"" sound...dont get me wrong, i love the ""downward spiral"" sound but i always LOVED ""broken"" the best....so anyway, GOOD ALBUM, GET IT!!!!!!!!!"
2,toothless and old...,"if you're looking for the innovation of ""pretty hate machine"" or the emotional savagery of ""broken,"" you won't find it here. even the aptly-titled ""the downward spiral"" held more appeal than this album does, and, for all its soundtrack-like variety, ""the fragile"" was much more listenable.it's as if old trent reznor is pulling a ""depeche mode"" on his fans -- we all know that the man is capable of creating wonderful music, but it seems as though his intent on making something new and different winds up steering his quality ever downward.i'm going to unload this cd at the local used cd store a.s.a.p., and wait for gary numan's upcoming ""jagged halo"" instead -- better to leave it to the man that started the genre to save it. reznor may have contributed in his time, but i'll not be buying another nine inch nails album at the rate he's going."
3,Trent Reznor being complacent,"Well, the album certainly wasn't Downward Spiral or the fragile, it was a more positive feel, and while the album wasn't a total loss, it was a complete leap into the unknown , I welcomed the changes, but it seems to only have washed out what could have been a really compelling album.Good players, good singing, I guess the direction of the album could have been worked on. The CD well, a tad inconvinient with the whole turning it over to get DVD functionality."
2,what the hell happend?,"I honestly wasnt expecting much from ""with teeth"" after hearing rumors and specualation, and quite frankly what could you really follow up a masterpeice like ""the fragile"" with? Well I didnt get much either. This album has some serious flaws glaring on its slick surface. The 3 and a half minute pop ditties on this record dont fit anywhere into the NIN we all know and love. Honestly its like Trent died and they got some look alike to make another album unbeknownst to his fans. I see a trend coming,...that being a bunch of bad albums from this once shining light in music. NIN fans will defend this album to the hilt but of course thats there right. If you like it for what it is fine but DO NOT expect anything approaching a masterpiece. Maybe Its time for TR to hang up the black clothing and computers and call it a day..........."
1,Does not play in most cd players,"Please beware that the Amazon description does not make it clear that this Dualdisc album will not play in most cd players. It lacks a table of contents, and most intelligent cd players just won't read it. This includes PCs running both Windows and Linux, as well as many car cd players. (I've tried!)"
5,My favorite NIN album yet...,"The lyrics alone impressed me right off the bat. It's obvious that Trent is maturing personally, and letting the music tell his tale. While every song on the album is great and the album plays well in order, my favorite tracks are: 13, 6, 12.Keep it up Trent; looking forward to the next!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"On the issue of this album taking 6 years to makes no difference to me. Just because its been that long has nothing to do with how long production actually took. Also, yes the lyrics are the same context as they always have been and I hope to God that doesnt change. That is what he does. Dont expect him to start whining about his childhood, girfriends and the like. Overall, I think this is a decent album, but I didnt like the lack of instrumental solos, I didnt like the lack of sound effects or unexpected crazy stuff. All of the songs are clear and easy to understand...not really his style. None of the songs really go together, the are all just songs that stand alone. You could listen to previous albums all the way through as a journey. Not this one. Pretty good just not what I expected."
3,not bad at all,I will admit that i was one of those that dismissed this album when it first came out but now i'm digging it. it seems that trent reznor tries very hard to deliver his best with every album that he releases and sometimes he makes bad decisiones on certain things that ultimately hinders his work. I don't really know where does this album fails...perhaps the repetitive nature of the sound?? Or perhaps the fact that if trent would really learn to sing a melody or two the work would seem a bit more fresh. I don't know but i do know this album ain't bad at all. it ain't no downward spiral that's for sure but it's still good.
4,A good album,"You have to give NIN credit, they are one of the few bands to make it this far. I had read a review that the new Backstreet album will be beter. I'd like to remind that person the BSB can't play instruments, write songs, or even sing without major computer assisstance. I also read this was crap compared to TDS. Of course it is! TDS is a once-in-a-lifetime album that no one can touch, not even NIN. But i'm getting sidetracked. the first half of the songs is trent saying 'here you go, some singles to sing along to.' The next half of the album will melt your spine to molases. Tracks like 'right where it belongs' are one of NIN's better songs. This album has a place in every NIN fan's collection, and I recommend it, just not with gusto. So for anyone who thinks trent can't sing, at least he didn't blow his career like that tart, ashlee, now there's your phony."
3,Not Bad,"Not bad. Definitely some good moments, but it's missing the darkness and despair of The Downward Spiral. And that's natural, since the guy obviously has fixed up his life, grown up, has a few bazillion dollars and probably isn't completely miserable anymore. The production is excellent at always, but a lot of the songs don't really go anywhere interesting, and some of the choruses are pretty crappy. It's not a bad album, but it does have some of that tired aging artist feel to it."
5,Beautiful,"This is one of those albums that the first time you listen to it you'll declare it to be crap. But, like all the best albums, you need to hear it multiple times in order to grok it. Many of the songs are so fragile (ha ha) that they sound as if they are about to shatter. Lyrically Reznor has aged, and astonishingly, unlike most artists, his music still speaks to me. No longer about teen angst, it seems to speak more to some of the more barren aspects of adulthood. Just stay away from the DVD-CD album. It doesn't play in many players being of an odd thickness. You should buy the record anyways."
3,"Different? yes, Bad? not entirley, Did it work....?","Well NIN really suit more to be a band that fits songs into a soundscape rather than a song, but Trent Reznor this time wanted to go for a new idea (which is the opposite of what anyone else has done in a funny way) and made actual songs and used melodies (he siad so in an interview)Whether he will do it next time or not he does'nt know, but likely it will be a bit of both, well thats someones guess, which could be dead wrong.Was it worth the wait, not really, so there you go: 3 stars."
3,Some new stuff with an older sound,"Sounds a lot like Pretty Hate Machine. Lots of good songs here, but most of them are more suited as background music. Not too many jump out and grab your attention. Does not even compare to Downward Spiral which is a timeless masterpiece."
3,"To sum it up, innovative at best","This being the first Nine Inch Nails album I've ever bought, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. What I got was 53 minutes and change worth of loud metal and weird synth effects. Not really the kind of music I listen to, but if you are a die-hard fan, it's makes a great addition to NIN collections. For me, the only two songs that really stand out amongst all the songs on the album are the two singles that were released, ""The Hand That Feeds"" and ""Only."""
2,"Terrible lyrics, same old sounds","With one exception: ""Know what you are?"" is Trent at his best.As for the rest of the album: you've heard it already. The lyrics are woeful - you'd find better in a high school poetry class, with titles like ""Death"". ""With teeth"" looks like an attempt to rewrite ""closer"" but it backfires badly. Maybe he thought ""She gets you hard"" would be all sexy and shocking. Maybe it is to teen girls, I dunno.There's the trouble: the album's too juvenile in tone for older NIN fans who've been around since Spiral or before, and it's too retro in sound for the younger audience I assume he's attempting to market to.Not the worst music being released, but that's not necessarily saying much."
1,What a disappointment,"I eagerly awaited this album. I loved Pretty Hate Machine. I loved The Fragile. Even the half of The Downward Spiral that I hated, I still appreciated because of the inventiveness and general feeling of Trent pushing the envelope. I have tried and tried to like this new album, but it just bores me and Trent's lyrics are the worst of his career. I am curious if all the people that have given this album great reviews are still wild about the album now that it has been out for awhile. The only good thing that I can say is that most of the songs remind me of better NIN songs from the past. I've listened to the older songs again. They are much better. Trent has spent his career redefining himself right up until this album. I hope he goes back to his daring ways."
4,Great but not a masterpeace,But still this is better then most of the albums to come out in 2005. But compairing this to The downward spirle is not the way to look at itHere is what i think of the songs.All The Love In The Word: Kind of blandYou Know What You Are?: OkThe Collector: Should have been the first singleThe Hand That feeds: Sounds like a Fragile outtakeLove Is Not Enough: I liked itWith teeth: I liked this one alot. But not good enough for a singleOnly: FillerGetting Smaller: Another great trackSunspots: FillerThe Line Beings To blur: Could have been better
2,"Bad Pop, Even Worse Rock, and Terrible Industrial","I thought Trent was better than this. Almost every track is boring emo garbage with little to no electronic work. I've never really liked his vocal work, but here it just deflates because he has few to no catchy melodies. The good tracks are ""The Hand That Feeds,"" ""Only,"" ""Beside You In Time"" (which is nice and experimental) and ""Right Where It Belongs.""The Fragile was good for its length and fairly catchy melodies. The Downward Spiral was good for its lyrics, repeating melody, and storyline. Pretty Hate Machine was good for its vast sparseness and minimalism. Get those if you haven't.Don't be fooled; With Teeth has none of NIN's redeeming qualities or songs which will stick. Trent seems to have sold out just about completely now."
1,Tree Trunk Arms and Cereal Box Philosophy,"Have mercy!! Please Mr. Reznor stop making these terrible albums before you destroy your legacy. These lyrics sound like they were penned by a fifteen year old kid that just smoked his first doobie. You used to stand for something....what happened? Mr.Reznor who gave you the philosophy 101 textbook? What's coming next the ""Question Reality"" tour. Anyways, I'm sure all the little kids you're stealing money from are quite impressed by your lame ramblings............................Don't forget your 5 o'clock workout you muscleman"
1,A very mediocre album. Extremely dissapointed.,"I am one of the very few honest people who is NOT afraid to tell it like it is. Pretty Hate Machine was great, Broken was amazing, the Downward Spiral was amazing, the Fragile was decent, and this album is terrible. Going through each track, I found myself hopelessly tuning out due to sheer boredom. Most of the tracks are slow to mid tempo and sound like a 400 pound fat man trying to walk through quick sand. It really falls short. Melodies? Some people think it has a ton of great ones, but personally I think that A-ha has them beat, and a million other bands. I wouldn't be as harsh, but after 6 goddamn years of not releasing anything for NIN, I feel entitled to bitch and am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO glad I didn't kill myself buying tickets to the sold out shows. For everyone else, your a sucker."
2,With(out)_Substance,"When NIN released this cd, i was super excited, having fallen in love with TDS...But when I bought it, I couldn't help but feel like I'd been ripped off...There's a weird thing with this cd. It feels like the songs are more like demos from the band, not fully finished tracks. Another main problem with the cd is the way some of the tracks seem to be using a formula now. The cd didn't come with any liner notes, but if you've heard 2 or more of their cd's, you won't need any. You'll probably be able to just guess what he's gonna say next. It feels like he sold out on some songs. But it isn't all bad. All the love in the world, You know what you are, Hand that feeds, Only, Everyday is exactly the same, and right where it belongs are good, (and the bonus Home), but that's less than half of the songs, and the album is too short...It just doesn't feel like enough for a six year wait..."
3,Not what I was expecting,"This album is very different from other nin stuff and I can't decide whether that is good or not. I enjoy it, but not the same way that I enjoy TDS and the Fragile. To me it feels more like a remix album than a straight studio album. There are moments listening to it when I think ""this is really good"" but then there are also moments when I just want to skip the track. Who knows maybe it will grow on me..."
3,don't buy this one,this album is ruined by the excessive amount of reverb put on mayte's voice. I give it three stars because it's mayte martin and I consider her to be the best singer in flamenco. But still you shouldn't buy this one cause it sounds ridiculous. Go with querencia instead. You won't be disappointed.
5,Brings Back Memories of Days Gone By,I spent 10 wonderful years in Limerick many years ago and had the honour of watching the author many times in his hey day. He was (and probably still is) a great iron player. I have read all of his books and realy enjoyed them. I particularly like this one as I love golf books with a bit of a historical theme and the lovely links at Doonbeg. His dedication to the late James (Jas) Carew who I had the pleasure to play with and against touched my heart strings as I was unaware of Jas's untimely passing. This book is a must for all golf fans.
2,Disappointed,Tried the product on a concrete wall and it did not work. It was a picture in a frame and after a couple days the hook fell off the wall. I followed the instructions.
2,"Great adhesive, but the hooks are sooooooo ugly.","You know, I swear by the 3M command adhesive line of sticky tabs. It's a great product.But the hooks are just hideous, clunky and ungainly ...so unstylish. They look like something you'd find yellowing on the wall of your grandfather's garage in 1975. The form is old-school and ugly; a different design era - and not in the good way These are hooks you'd put some place that you can close the door on (a cabinet), so you don't have to look at them.Come on 3M, this is the age of the iPod, not the 8-track. You'd sell so many more of these if they weren't so naff. Hire a product designer from the modern era and revamp this line."
2,And they all came tumbling down,"Our indoor Christmas lights have all fallen to the floor. Evidently 3M hooks don't stick for long on textured walls, however I can find no warning about this on the product packaging or in the literature. Beware. Hopefully I will someday need this newly purchased pile of hooks for use on a smooth surface somewhere, but it certainly won't be on any of our walls as every last one of them is textured. Good product. Irresponsible marketing. We are not amused."
1,DISASTER !!!!!!!!,"I was so excited about this hooks coz i live in a rental property and wanted to hang something,so i bought a few and it looked like magic. But not for long in the middle of the night i was awaken by the crash of my picture and boy i will be in more trouble with that wall even more than had i drilled a small nail in coz the hooks came out with chunks of the wall plaster. What a disaster?????? please dont waste your money"
5,"Fantastic, especially for an apartment","Having moved into an apartment with little storage space, I needed places to put belts, umbrellas, bath robes, etc. Trying not to damage the walls or doors, these provided the perfect solution for me. Easy to set up anywhere, and very strong once in place. My only problem is keeping myself in check with how many of these I put up. They come in many sizes (and strengths) and I used the small and medium ones to great effect."
5,Better than I thought,"I actually bought my hooks from Lowe's, not Amazon but they are the exact same size and brand and I love buying online so I thought I'd share my experience.So glad to say these hooks stick a lot better than I thought they would - they were a last resort for hanging up my shoe organizer - I lost the original hooks which latched over the top of the door. I purchased some different over-the-door hooks, but they were too big for the holes. Luckily, the store clerk showed me these and said that a lot of customers actually come in to the store looking for them specifically.After 2 days, the shoe organizer is still hanging securely to the door even with several pairs of boots and other shoes on it."
2,No good,I'm disappointed with the results of my command strips though it organizes well it did not remove well from my walls! First I thought I was taking it off wrong but then a friend of mine who's an interior designer who uses this in his own home went to remove it from my walls and he had the same results as me! The paint on my wall ripped right off in multiple places from the hooks but I do lov the hooks just it doesn't come off clean !
1,Worthless,"Would not hold a small picture frame weighing about 1/2 lb. Fell, broke glass, broke frame, wouldn't support string of small xmas lights on inside wall, totally worthless product."
2,OK PIECE,"I HAVE HAD THIS ITEM FOR 3 YEARS NOW. GOOD PRODUCT, BUT I WASTED MY MONEY, COULD HAVE GOT SOMETHING ELSE"
1,Does not hold anything on the wall,"This was a waste of my money. It did not hold anything on the wall, not even small photos. I really wanted to send it back but they charge you so much for shipping it was not worth it. I just threw in the trash."
4,"Works well, but not perfect","Out of the box, installation was simple and very easy. Throughout the use over the past several months, I've had good but also mixed resultsSome thoughts:* Can certainly hold up to 3-5 lbs - be it jackets, umbrellas, keys, anything.* However, one or two of these fell, but that could partially be our error.* Saves a lot of space and looks good on the wall, or wherever you decide to place these.* Doesn't hurt your wall and easy to take off.Overall, a good solution to not having to put holes into your walls. Just be wary that potentially, one or a couple of these hooks may need some adjustment to stay on the wall."
5,Excellent hooks - have never let me down!,"I love these hooks! I set them up throughout my dorm apartment, and they have never once failed me. I can hang a bath towel (pretty heavy, I would say!) and hand towel onto one hook, and they will remain on it perfectly. I also use them to hang purses and totes, winter coats, belts, and a dry erase board. They have -never- ""sunk"" or loosened - all the hooks remain firmly in the position I set them up in (which, by the way, was a breeze!). I highly recommend these hooks and can't see why others didn't like them - maybe they messed up on adhering them to the wall? Or maybe they just tried to hang too much - every product does have its limit, after all. But, with proper use, these hooks sure have been a valuable addition to my apartment!"
4,Medium hooks,"I have only used one of these so far, and while I don't anticipate putting much weight on this hook there is one thing I must mention.They do NOT hold well on textured surfaces like dry-wall with said surface and latex paint. The first experiment showed that the surface had to be lightly sanded to give a more consistent surface texture, and then cleaned. I used a 400 grade sandpaper, and cleaned the surface with a rubbing alcohol swab.This time the connection is very tight, and I will always ""level"" a surface before I start putting one in place, if you are putting it on a smooth surface, just be sure to clean it with something like the rubbing alcohol.CCW."
2,Command Medium Hooks,"These are for texture surfaces only. They are NOT for smooth painted doors. The surface must be cleaned and prepared according to instructions and no weight applied to it for the stated time period. I have a small clock hanging from one applied to a textured, painted wall that has been in place for 3 years. Those that I applied to the backs of painted, smooth surface doors did slide off under their own weight after 4 days. I hung a plastic hanger on one after waiting 2 days before using it. The next morning the Command Hook and plastic hanger (7 oz) were on the floor."
3,Doesn't work in the bathroom,"I bought these hooks to hang in the bathroom since the hook behind my door had broken. After I hung the hooks, after a few days, it fell right off without anything hanging on it. I guess the moisture from taking a shower made the hook unstick. Haven't tried it in other areas of the house as I currently don't have a need for it."
2,1 of the hooks broke after a week,1 of the hooks broke after a week other than that the hooks have seemed to work well sticking to wood not plaster
5,Love it,Great Product and good price! I have gotten some from the stores before. They fall after 2 days. I have these on a rather rough surface now for about 2 weeks. They are still going strong. Love it.
4,"As described, made by 3M, same products, new name...","Just as described, I don't like being asked to write such a long answer for a very simple question. This should be optional and not a requirement."
5,These rock,"Everything about command strips is awesome. These worked great for hanging coats, towels, etc. in my dorm room, where there weren't a lot of other options. If you follow the instructions, you won't damage the walls/paint either. If you just yank it off, though, you probably will mess something up. Love that these are reusable with more command strips."
4,As expected,"These are decent little hooks if applied to a clean and dust-free surface; when they are removed they leave no damage or residue on the wall. Excellent for use in a temporary situation, they come with two pieces of double-sided tape so can be installed twice. Very handy."
3,Love/Hate,"I love these because you can hang them anywhere - the bathroom for towels on the back of the door, hooks for my daughter's bow hanger, and a shoe organizer on door full of misc items. But, they have all broken off - every one of them. My daughter has pulled on the towels, her bow holder and I pulled on the shoe organizer trying to shut a door. The hooks just snap in half. But, I am ordering another 6 pack so I haven't learned my lesson."
5,Best chairside tool to have in the operatory,"Whether you are a patient wondering more about how to enhance your smile, a dental student learning how to treatment plan aesthetic procedures, or a seasoned clinician looking for patient education, look no further. Dr. Dorfman's explanations of cosmetic procedures is both simplistic and to the polnt. I'm in dental school and saw Dr. Dorfman speak at my school and purchased this book so my patients could browse through it during our long appointment times and everyone really enjoys the read. A couple of patients ""accidentally"" tried to take it home with them then I told them to buy it from Amazon :)"
5,IF I ONLY KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW,"OK EVERYONE LISTEN TO ME IT'S IMPORTANT. TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH. I THOUGHT I HAD BUT, IF A SINGLE TOOTH NEEDS TO BE PULLED, PLEASE PLEASE GET A SECOND OPINION PLEASE. THIS BOOK ""BILLION DOLLAR SMILE"" OFFERED SO MANY SOULUTIONS TO MY DENTURE PROBLEM AND OPTIONS WHICH MY DENTIST NEVER OFFERED. THE AUTHOR IS DIRECT AND SO KEEN TO NOT ONLY YOUR SMILE, BUT FUNCTION AND THE EMOTIONAL SIDE. I HAVE SUFFERED FOR 2 YEARS NEVER KNOWING I HAD AND HAVE ALTERNATIVES!!! IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ELSE TODAY FLOSS! IF YOU ARE HAVING A PROCEDURE DONE = READ THE BOOK BY DR. DORFMAN FIRST. PLEASE. I HOPE YOU KNOW FUNCTION IS BETTER THAN LOOK AND HEALTHIER BUT DR. DORFMAN DOES IT ALL. IF I WIN LOTTO? I WILL FIND HIM AND ASK HIM TO PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME. I HAVENT EATEN SOLID FOODS IN 2 YEARS. THANK YOU FOR READING THIS SOME DAY YOU JUST MAY THANK ME. SINCERELY KAREN IN FULLERTON"
3,"A book on smile for the general public, not specifics","I was completed misguided regarding what this book was intended for, either by the description of the book or by my ignorance. But I bought this book thinking it was goign to give more specifics on how Dr. Dorfman ""does"" his esthetics. But the book is very generic review on what a smile is and what makes a good smile.I gave it a 3-star rating because it is not a bad book. Just not what I thought the book was about at all."
5,Just what I needed,"This item mates with the Delta Faucet U4301-PK:Delta Faucet U4301-PK Universal Showering Components Shower Arm Pin Mount, ChromeThe swivel connector is chrome plated plastic, but lasts for years. The old one it replaced lasted nearly 18 years, and I expect to get at least as much from this replacement. I ordered a second one, just to be sure.The illustration is not that great, but the chrome plated product I received is as advertised and looks great."
1,"Disappointment with ClickArt 360,000","I have worked with several Broderbund products before and enjoyed them, however when I received the software in the package there was no book, no instructions to navigate through the system, and too much switching of CDs to get to a simple graphic that I wanted."
1,Piano Bar Beethoven,"My, My! Where does one begin? Dull, flat, uninspired? Maybe, uninteresting. Beethoven is one of the more complex composers to interpret. Mr. Pratt shouldn't expose himself on such demanding material; simply not a career booster. Skip this one!"
1,Mr. McNuggets,"Strikes me much as eating Chicken McNuggets for Thanksgiving: anonymous, empty, liquified, semi-sorta-processed, wanna-be meat that one's a bit ashamed of ingesting, yet very amusing regardless that it exists in the first place. F+"
4,An intro to Tillard,"This book provides a good introduction to Tillard'swork. It was written in response to some questions aboutthe sources for Tillard's larger work _Church of Churches_,but the English translation of that book was rathersloppy. This translation, however, is very good, anda good introduction to the work of J.-M.-R. Tillard."
5,Caddy Hat,I bought this hat for a present for my boyfriend because he is all about Cadillac. He greatly enjoyed it.
3,Artists??,"I continue to be baffled why sellers insist on listing the composers of compilation collections. I realize that in some instances the composer and the artist are same, however that's not always the instance. I want to know who the performer(s) is/are and don't have any major interest as to who wrote the selections."
4,"wonderful music, some distortion","Excellent music, performance and orchestra; but there is some annoying distortion in some of the pieces during loud high trumpet notes. I had the original Kapp records and they had less of this problem."
2,SDX3 Squash Shoes don't hold up in weekly use.,"I bought these through Amazon in June 2005. I am a beginner squash player and play 1-2 times a week. By November, the seams were starting to rip (where the blue contacts the white on top). I sewed them up with mono-line and it held up for ~3 weeks and ripped again. I tried sewing them one more time and it was not use after another week. I used them for a little while longer but the fabric broke down inside and my toes would punch through. Never owned a sneaker that only held up for about 6 months. I would say they are wide shoes and very comfortable and work well on the courts. I would buy them again since the fit is good, but only if I knew they redesigned them to be stronger. But ~$70 (w/shipping) every 6 month would be a horrible investment. I am now looking for another brand. Any ideas for people with wide feet?"
1,Worst athletic shoes I ever bought,I paid $100 for these shoes and after three weeks I threw them in the trash can. The leather cracked on the tops and the entire sole came off of the left shoe. They felt heavy on my feet when I did wear them. There was nothing I liked about these shoes except the design.
3,Alphabet Flip Chart - Nothing Spectacular...,"I bought this for my son to help him learn, and while I know that he is too young for it now, I am not thoroughly impressed. For the price, I wasn't expecting this great toy, but I though it would be a little more well made. The wooden spindles/rods that hold the letters are pretty flimsy and pliable. While I read in another review that her grandson (I think) smashed theirs on the floor creating choking hazards, I do not see how a child would be able to choke on the letters. Maybe mine is constructed a bit differently? Overall, it is an ok product, but I would not buy it again."
5,slight correction to previous,"In the service of customer satisfaction I must correct a previous review: Dead Can Dance have nothing to do with ""Sahara Blue"". Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard do not contribute to the album, and neither is there a track called ""Black Stream"". It would be easy to mistake their presence, though, as the album revels in a variety of world musics, celtic included.Their absence is not a disaster, however, as there is a plethora of extremely talented musicians working with Zazou. ""Sahara Blue"" still sounds magnificent nearly 10 years since its release. If you like challenging yet satisfying contemporary music this is one of Zazou's best."
4,Pretty little earrings,"These are pretty little earrings, I worried they were going to be tiny little things, really cheap, but they aren't. I like them.I bought them as a gift, so I haven't actually tried them on myself, and the only thing I might change about them is maybe lowering the location to more center of the heart on the back, so less of a chance of them flopping ( pointing downwards ) when fastened on the earlobe. I plan on getting a set for myself if I'm able to.Delivery was prompt etc also :)."
5,Sabine is Sublime!!!,"A gorgeous, magical ride. Each and every note carries with it both sensitivity and anticipation. If you are lucky, the soundtrack that plays behind your most fabulous dreams."
3,Not the best!,"As a long time clarinet player I have 4 recordings of the Mozart Clarinet Concerto.Sabine is really good, technique out the kazoo but for me it's a bit much. It's as if she's competing with all the other guys who have played and recorded this lovely solo and while I could never have equalled her performance, I far prefer a much older recording by Robert Marcellus.His recording isn't so much about speed and flash, but it demonstrates a love of the piece - gentle, flowing and passionate. In his performance, less is more.You can actually get teary eyed in the slow movement."
3,Does not come with it's own containers,"After being tired of changing leaking gaskets I decided to give Hawkins Futura a try. I liked it's look & body and performance.I agree it is a good cooker ,but unlike my old Whistling Pressure cooker I cannot cook 3 different things at ""one go"". It does not whistle so i had to play with heat level & timing to get my Rice & lentils cooked . The CookBook Instructions where not good enough for me.Also my problem was it does not come with its own container,this is not mentioned in the product details.Another point i would like to mention is the cooker is not dishwasher safe, i put mine in and I could see the shine is gone and the water has left a mark , it is handwash only.I gave it 3 stars because you can use the cooker as a whole for cooking, its better if you have two ."
3,Good product,"It is very beautiful color, but the lid takes a while to get used to it. Overall, it is a good, not great product."
5,good is ok. great is the word. I owned one for the last 30 years. it's bigger!!,"i bought one for Me at least 30 years ago. I got this one thru a magazine issued by a bank. perhhaps at that time I hope It was Made in America. Any way it is goood!!!. I got this one as a gift for my Sister in law; She saw the pressure cooker 25 years ago in My house and did not expressed to me nor my Wife how much She liked the unit, and She started in her own looking for it and no luck; until few months ago She said to me she was in love with the unit since then. I serched and I found it one more time; I ordered the cooker. She is very happy with it.Was this to long?????????????"
2,Not worth the money,"The cooker has many cons, i do not recommend this1. It does not whistle so you will have to keep check on the time while cooking.2. It is not dish washer safe3. The lid is bit tricky to close until you get used to it and it might interfere with food.4. It is not non stick cooker."
3,it ok. need to get used to it,this product is different than what normal cookers are as it cooks very fast and sometimes too much. potatoes get mashed and so do some other whole grains . need to learn the timing of how much to cook with this product that is very important. you will usually learn that by yourself and there is not predetermined timing. instructions are easy to follow. overall the product is ok
1,It arrived damaged,"I was so excited to receive my highly rated pressure cooker. However, it arrived with a chip in the handle, near the edge of the pot.I've never had a pressure cooker before and have what is perhaps a irrational fear of pressure cooker explosions, so any sort of defect in the cooker only worsens my fear. This defect may or may not have had any effect on the safe operation of the cooker but I'm not taking any chances.The chip was deep enough to have removed the paint and taken a small chunk out of the metal/plastic or whatever the handle is made of, so even if it had nothing to do with the seal, I assume that over time it would reduce the structural integrity of the cooker.Plus, I'm wary of any brand new item that is already damaged. It doesn't make me feel confident about the overall quality of the item.So, unfortunately, I've returned it."
1,Less Bang for Buck.....Deceiving Do Not Purchase this!!!,"Liked previous reviews, that's why we bought it; however, this Pressure cooker has an inherent problem, the lid just does not open up easily it at all. It's a challenge to open this lid especially when the contents & the cooker is very hot; &, when it opens up , it will not simply go back in place & lock. It's a struggle to open & close. I will not recommend this to anyone. The photograph is deceiving & misleading, there is NO Handle-Ear on the other side of the cooker that can help in picking it up. Also when we got it, it was not new. We paid for new, but we got a used one with scratches everywhere & a very bad finish. Do not Go by the photographs.PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY & DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.But I must say that Amazon Return policy is excellent, they really helped me out in taking this back immediately."
4,Works as advertised,The pressure cooker is sturdy and and absorbs heat very well. The cooking times are fast. Food tastes good due to steam cookingThe reason for 4 stars is that it makes a lot of noise when steam is released from the top.
3,"Rating says it all. It's just okay. It's really annoying to put this assymetrical top on and off, and the so called non stick su","It's really annoying to put this assymetrical top on and off, and the so called non stick surface is non stick only if you use a steel wool pad the manual says not to. Unlike other pressure cookers, it has no gauge, so you adjust it based on the whistle, and it's very sensitive to burner changes. You have to keep the pot under a higher flame than they tell you, which is what causes the food to burn onto the surface. So no, I'm not crazy about the product."
4,My Childhood dream cooker.. enjoying it.,"When I purchased it.. was after reading all reviews. It is difficult to work with at 1st instant but gradually u ll discover its better than other ones. When I used it 1st time I felt its very difficult but then I found a easy way to deal with, it doesnt whistles like other pressure cooker so U ll never know whats the right time to remove from heat but it definitely sizzles..which indicates that pressure is built and steam starts coming out from lil nozzle..so its ready and u need to be alert and remove is just as u would with other whistling cookers.The lid locking is not difficult, u only have to keep it at right angles while inserting in body and then keep it parallel and apply some pressure to lock it. That is all. No difficulties as I read in reviews and was scared. Its similar to the prestige non stick handi if somebody used it.Body and make over is adorable simply.. u ll luv it beyond doubts.. and once u r used to u ll hate other brands..:) as I did."
5,"Great Buy, Best in the World","This is a without doubt the best Pressure Cooker in the world for home use.Its Design, Functionality and utility is unmatched.It is very Energy Efficient and yet thoroughly & quickly cooks food without loss of Nutrition or Taste.With this cooker, you are limited by your own imagination of what Dishes you make.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a quality Pressure Cooker for home use. Comes in several sizes and pricing."
4,Good purchase for the price,"Pressure cooker is an essential item for Indian kitchens and we are no exceptions. After using the conventional Hawkins pressure cookers for a long time we switched to this Futura range. The look is very nice, works really great and price is reasonable. Unlike other users we never had any issues with closing and opening the lid as we are accustomed to that."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I can't understand why this has ANY positive reviews. I would give it zero stars if I could. I spent 30+ minutes ""practicing"" how to put on and take off the lid. IT's supposed to be done without touching the food. IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE 2.0 LITRE SIZE. I challenge anyone to prove otherwise. After so much frustration following the directions (trying to fit the oval lid into the inside lip of the pot) I was afraid my blood pressure would blow. IMHO this is a defective design. It's going RIGHT BACK."
2,Will this get much use?,"I purchased this pressure cooker to use in my camper through Amazon.com, and I was sorry I did. I have used pressure cookers for cooking and canning for over 30 years. Each one functioned well and served our family for a long time. When I received the Hawkins I had serious doubts about the longevity this cooker would have in my camper because of its construction - thinner gauged sheet metal in the body, long thin handle with points that looked less than strong, unfinished interior, etc. I contacted the company, but have yet to hear back from them. I decided to discard the item rather than risk it."
5,Can last a lifetime,"Cooks fast,cooks well,looks good,extremely durable stuff and easy-to-handle pressure regulator.This is definitely better than other stock pressure cookers I have used.Its so sturdy, looks like it can last a lifetime. Highly recommended."
4,cooker,i order Futura by Hawkins Hard Anodized 4.0 Litre Pressure Cooker from Hawkins i received at time and i really like this product.i can recommend this product to everyone.
3,Ok but not upto my expectations,It's good but I thought it would be a little bigger. I had a 3 liter pressure cooker and that one cooks a little more than this. Also I cannot cook all Types of foods like moong dal . I use it a lot for Indian cooking and it's not upto the standard. However the cleaning is very easy. It cleans like a breeze. I cannot clean any off my other cookers so easy.
2,Not as good as expected,"Doesn't maintain pressure, steam leaks. Not sure whether this a common problem for this model; the one i received might be a faulty one!!"
5,Don't be afraid!,"Great product, I don't know why I was ever afraid of pressure cookers. The results are amazing & Futura is easy to use. It's also good looking."
4,first pressure cooker..,"i was a little nervous about this, but it really is full proof. had great tender meat with little practice under my belt."
4,Futura,This is definitely better the cookers you get at Indian stores in and around Boston. Its a better bargain too. This arrived in very good condition and have been using this for a couple of months without issues.
5,Pressure cooker,I have used pressure cookers all my life. This is the first one I felt comfortable using. I especially liked the release pressure valve. It is a keeper.
3,Recommended with reservations,"Nicely finished but the design of the lid requires you to put it inside the cooker and rotate 90 degrees. A little tricky until you get used to it and the lid can come into contact with whatever you have inside the cooker. Check the price WITH shipping, the current vender is gouging on shipping charges."
5,Excellent cooker -- just not for induction cooktops.,"If you have an induction cooktop, this won't work. On gas and electric cooktops, this works just fine. I've had a 5.0 litre for years now -- no issues at all. I just wish they made the same design in stainless steel that works on induction cooktops. The new stainless steel version, according to the company website, works on gas/electric/halogen cooktops, but not induction."
4,Fabulous First,"This is my first ever pressure cooker, and I must say that I am quite comfortable using it. It was actually a quick learn as the directions in the manual are quite clear. I have used it multiple times already to cook dried beans and chicken stock. I have no complaints."
5,Perfect!,"They arrived yesterday and I'm very happy with them. I've been looking all over for pants like these. I'm curvy and I wear anything between a 12 or a 14 and the large fits perfect. I would suggest maybe a size down if you want them more form fitted. I really like the ""great outdoors"" aesthetic they have and I personally think they look really cute with spaghetti string tops or babydoll t-shirts."
2,These run very big for size,I ordered these in small and they were huge. Looked more like a large to me. I put them on and they feel right off. I sent them back.
5,Just what I wanted!,"These fatigues are just what I wanted, they run a little big but they have an adjustable waste. Very comfortable. Perfect for the urban jungle! TY"
5,Magical.,"I initially bought the extra small vintage paratrooper fatigues, but today where enormous! I am 4'10"" and have a curvy figure at 115 pounds. If you have a Waist line that is less than 36 inches, these are the right size for you."
3,Camo pants,Pink camo..so cool. Better than what we wore in the service. I'm wearing these to the tropics on my vacation next week
2,not as advertised,"These are supposed to be polyester and cotton...they are not they are ramie (which is cotton) and cotton! BIG difference!also....the pink camo and the olive green are totally different in size even tough they are both mediums! also...the zipper on the olive pair (even though they are labeled ""womens"" are on the wrong side."
4,Lovr the pants,"There is nothing sexy about these camo cargo pants, but I do like them. Haven't worn them yet because they are too long, like for a six foot woman. The pants re sturdy and well made. I would reccomend them to anyone who likes pink camo."
5,Too cute,Love these fatigues. I like the way I can ajust the length to wear various shoes or boots. Great Item thanks
5,yes,"These are very nice pants, these fit me fine even though I am a tiny person! At first when i looked at them i thought maybe they wouldn't fit me because they looked so big, but they have stings to tie at the bottom and top. I love the pockets too! They are pretty deep and there is lots of them"
3,"Read both sides, please","If you want to read both sides of the Spanish Inquisition,(yes, there were some ""pros"" as well as ""cons""), two excellentbooks are ""Characters of the Inquisition"" by William T. Walsh,and ""Inquisition"" by Edward Peters....The Peters book is especially insightful (and delightful) becausein the first half of the book he gives balanced history of the variousinquisitions, and in the second half gives the history of how the historywas exaggerated and falsified into our popular view of the Inquisitionin the English speaking world."
5,I love to use grammar in sentences!!!!!!!!!!!,"Tom Ready helped my a lot. He showed me how to use grammar in sentences and let me tell you it is FUN!!! Let me give you some exciting sentences that you use grammar in. GRAMMAR is fun. You can have fun with GRAMMAR. You will have fun with GRAMMAR. You can't have fun without GRAMMAR. You can't do anything that is more fun than GRAMMAR. GRAMMAR is the only thing to do with your time. You can't live without GRAMMAR. You will die if you don't use GRAMMAR in every part of your life. See, this book showed me everything I need in life and that is grammar. I don't think I could live if I didn't have this book. Now there is another Grammar Wars book and let me tell it is even better. Well I want to thank Tom Ready for giving me something to live for and die for.........PRAISE GRAMMAR!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Northern Lights: the Soccer Trails,"This award winning picture book is the story of Kataujaq, a young girl living in Canada's arctic who loses her mother to a sudden illness. Kauaujaq greatly misses her mother, and several years pass with her dealing with her grief on her own. It is explained that the people of her village like to play soccer out on the sea ice under the moonlight, using a caribou skin ball stuffed with moss and fur. Her grandmother tells her that the thousands of thin strands of light moving about in the northern lights above them are really the souls of those that have passed on, playing soccer with a huge, frozen walrus head. This greatly consoles Kataujak as she feels her mother's presence, and no longer feels as lonely.Full of Canadian content, the text and illustrations realistically convey many aspects of life in Canada's north. Highly recommended as a read-aloud for children in grades 1-2."
4,Of special interest to longtime Mike Oldfield fans,"This CD showcases Maggie Reilly's silky, melancholy voice through several genres in the last two decades. Notably, ""Every Time we Touch"" is a much different arrangement than the previous album or single versions. Those familiar with her singing for Mike Oldfield will find her rendition of ""To France"" a fresh interpretation, more evocative of the Scottish highlands than Mike Oldfield's original arrangement."
2,Disappointing,"I teach 3-5 year olds, and was so excited to see this product,but I guess I was hoping for too much. I needed some good stuff foran Easter lesson and there were only 3 projects/graphics to choose from. I was also very disappointed in the small selection of coloring pages available. For the price they should have a lot more graphics and projects. It almost seems that the whole program is geared toward getting you to purchase add-on packs. The one thing that I did like, however, was the door-hangers you can make. But, that kind of project is NOT worth the price."
5,Landmark Soprano. Essential for Opera lovers,"Maria Callas may be the only female operatic 'superstar' working in my lifetime. In the 1950s and early 1960's, she had all the star power and paparrazi draw of Jackie and Marilyn, far outstripping the fame to the world at large of her primary rival, Renita Tibaldi. I am not an expert, or even an experienced amateur at evaluating operatic sopranos; however I've listened to several of the modern crop, and while the newbies probably do a better job of keeping on key, none of them can match the drama emoted by Ms. Callas on any given aria. All three releases are especially good buys, as they all run to over 72 minutes; however the recording quality does show its early (pre-multitrack, pre-digital) recording technology. Each is as good as the next regarding content, but 2 and 3 are a bit better in sound quality."
4,Good and solid,The bowl is very big which is good for my two smaller dogs. Why? Because Moxy likes to take the bowl way out in the yard and chew on it. She is not able to get a grip on this unless she finds a way to turn it over. I only gave it a 4 star because I can't get her to stop drinking the soap water that is placed around the outside to keep the ants out. I am thinking I will try squirting some lemon juice (or a lot)in there and maybe that will stop her. Any suggestions would be appreciated!
5,Bergan ant free pet bowl.,"Really good bowl if you want to keep ants out. It is too big for cats like eveybody says, but I put a smaller bowl in the food section of the bowl and it works just fine. Never had a problem with ants since I started using and would recommend this product to others. Very functional, just need to find a place for it. Hope this helps."
2,Not for Cats,"I was planning on using this for my cat. The one I received was huge, only suitable for a medium sized to large dog. I'm pretty sure I ordered one that said it was for cats so I don't know why I got the dog sized one."
4,Ant-free pet dish,"This product would be great for dogs, however it's a bit too large for my cats. This was the smallest ant-free pet bowl I could find and I'm just happy my kitties don't have ants in their food."
4,My opinion of the Ant Free pet feeder,"This feeder holds dry food and water for my 2 cats. I leave dry food available for them at all times. The moat system is a very good idea to keep ants out of the food. I tried to create a version of this on my own, and ran into immediate problems because the cats would move the food bowl to the edge of the ""moat"" allowing the ants to avoid the water. I didn't realize for a couple of days that being unable to remove the bowls from the moat was going to be a problem. I solved it quickly by placing their old bowls into the fixed ones. In a perfect world the unit could be disassembled to clean it. It works and will last for years."
5,Ant free pet bowl,This ant free pet bowl works great! Not one ant has made its way to our cats' food. It is a little large but we have two big cats so perfect for our needs!
2,Doesn't work,"Theoretically, the moat should keep ants away. However, I was suprised to see lines of ants in the food all the time. Turns out that little bits of dust, dirt, grass, etc quickly accumulate in the water creating a bridge that the ants walk across on.The only way I've found this bowl to work is by constntly cleaning out the bowl - about every 2 days, which totally defeats the purpose of having bought it. Looks like the moat idea just wasn't the solution. Anta are VERY determined creatures!"
3,Spill Proof,"I got this not because of ants. My large, male dog drinks his water by lapping it over the far edge. Always a mess indoors.Problem solved."
5,Great and wonderful!!!,"This is a great product. I had a serious ant problem and threw away a lot of dry cat food with regular bowls. Now, no ant problem at all. It works just as they claim. I have three outside cats, and the size works well for me. I would definitely recommend it."
4,"Good concertos, great performances.","We are currently in a Golden Age of violin playing with an abundance of outstanding young artists. However, even in this halycon time, Sarah Chang stands out. Her technical virtuosity is staggering, but her artistry is, perhaps, even more impressive. I would give this CD five stars for the Vieutemps concerto, but the Lalo is not quite on the same level. An impresive CD, nevertheless."
5,"One of the best, another superb piece by the virtuoso.",Fell in love with her skill and emotion. As good as any by anyone..
1,She tried too hard...and the quality of the book shows it.,The author tried too hard to create five different personalities. Her methods of doing this were crude and obvious. I rushed through this book only to fulfill a promise that I made to read it. The book isn't worth a tinker's damn.
3,Disappointed in the end,Overall this was a good read but the ending did not live up to the rest of the book.
1,Not for me,"After reading such stellar reviews of this book, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I'm halfway through it and I just don't get it. There are some really beautiful examples of writing in the book, but I keep waiting (completely in vain) for ""the point."" So far all it's done is given me the urge to shower again due to the descriptions of hoarders, cockroaches, pet tarantulas, yellowed teeth, crack houses, and an overwhelming lack of good hygiene from the characters. Not really feeling it, and I don't get the hype."
1,I must admit I was very dispointed with this book.,"I began this novel hoping to read something new and different. I am forced to admit that I gave up after 290 pages. I know, only 60 to go, but this novel is just dreadful. Goth, angst, lesbians, homosexuals, the war in heavan ( not very well explained might I add). Who cares? I realized I didn't care about a single character. Not a very promising debue."
3,"Beautifully written, disappointing story","The prose in this novel (and every other work by Kiernan that I have read) is magnificent. I read Kiernan because of her storytelling abilities.This novel was more or less a character study. There was a fairly interesting story in there, but the main focus of Silk was the experiences, feelings, and motivations of the main characaters - especially Spyder. I was simply left feeling lukewarm, at best, towards them. There are some creepy moments here, and Kiernan does an excellent job at making me feel the characters' fear... but that is about all I was able to feel for them."
3,Slow-moving gothic horror,"Traditional horror readers might be disappointed by Silk. The poetic descriptions are subtle, unwrapping too slowly to create enough thrill or tension. I was also distracted by the odd lilt of Keirnan's writing style. Her metaphors are strangely worded, and feel somewhat forced to me.The subject matter is much like Poppy Z. Brite. Goths will love the similar references to their subculture's music and attitudes. But Brite's writing is sharper and more natural. I'd recommend Silk to goth fiction fans only."
2,Confusing,"I read this book as part of a group read...and we were all confused. Many things are never explained and you have no clue what it was supposed to mean or why they did it. I'm not saying the story wasn't interesting, it was, but at the end of the story, I was left thinking ""Huh?"" Plus, to add to the confusion, the story time line jumps around, add in a few dream sequences and drug freak outs. Not a book I'd recommend."
1,Don't try this at home,"I bought this book because I had read a good review of the follow-up ""Murder of Angels"" and thought this would be a better starting point. I am a voracious reader, and I can honestly say I rarely use the word ""hate"" when describing a book. I won't use it this time either, but I will say that I can never get back the time I spent (wasted?) reading this book. To be fair, maybe it just wasn't for me. If you are really into super-confusing, creepy books with self-pitying, annoying, wear-it-on-their sleeve outcast characters-- this might be just the tale for you."
2,Maybe I'm Missing Something,"Silk has a permanent home on my bookshelf next to Poppy Z. Brite's Lost Souls. I've read them both twice, to be fair, and don't really intend to read them again.Perhaps I just don't understand this brand of ""horror."" Throughout the entire story, I wondered what I was intended to think of the characters. Was I supposed to like them? Was I supposed to care about them at all? If so, then I must have missed something. All I saw were a bunch of boring Gen X-ers in a small town who died in some bizarre, but ultimately inexplicably dull ways for no apparent reason. If there was a point to this book, other than ""Some stuff that happened to these people I once knew,"" I couldn't find it."
5,Kiernan at her finest,"If you aren't already familiar with Caitlin R. Kiernan from her fabulous short fiction, I strongly recommend SILK. This is definately NOT your mother's horror novel! I was completely blown away by the book. Kiernan's voice is distinct and powerful, and not for the squeamish. Five stars."
2,somewhere short of fantastic,"i enjoyed the book for the most part but it was nothing that i had hoped for and was quite dissapointing as the horror didn't arise until almost the last chapter and what was the horror was hardly imaginative or well explained. overall i would say that if you're looking for vivid writing buy this book but if you're looking for horror, this is not what you're looking for. the horror was shabbily thrown together and the ending was poorly examined which left me with a dissapointed look in my eyes and an urge to get up and pick up one of my ""good"" books just to get the horror i wanted."
2,disappointing,"I thought the first half of Kiernan's novel Silk to be brilliant-- sheer poetry and a definite return to the great southern gothic style that characterized Faulkner, O'Conner, and some of Oates' recent works. But after spending so much time developing her characters, setting mood, Kiernan falters into fantasy, garbled action, and typical horror schlock. She systematically does away with her characters in typical ten-little indians style, never fully exploring the threads she sows earlier-- the war of the angels and the effects of childhood abuse. Rather than a psychological exploration, it simply becomes another in a growing list of bodiless, rootless horror. She's capable of much better."
1,"Not a novel, just a big pile of sentences.","I will keep this short, as short as Silk should have been. Kiernan's verbose novel is tolerable only to those who have little or no interest in story, who wish to spend (waste) their time swimming in the superficial, faux-Gothic,pretentious crud known as ""Goth."" This bastardized version of Gothicism will not appeal to people who enjoy the work of true Gothic writers, such as Poe and Shelley, for more than just the ""spooky"" descriptions. Kiernan's Silk is all about the make-up, people. The most Gothic thing about this novel is the mysterious lack of plot."
2,Much ado about nothing...,"Very disappointing read, and don't get me wrong, I like gothic literature and knew what I was in for. The problem with this particular gothic novel is that it's really only a short story strung out over hundreds of pages. Very slow, but I kept hoping it was going to build into a real crescendo. Unfortunately, even the ending is slow and a let-down. I love Caitlin's writing and the ins and outs of the characters like Spyder and Robin kept me going till the end, but then when it was finished, I was like, what was the point? No monsters...not even a villain to speak of! It's just words on a page. It's like my brother jumping out of a closet saying boo! Not really scary, just kind of there. I give it two stars for writing style, but if you're looking for plot, look elsewhere."
5,A Balancing Act,"This novel walks the lands that lie between dreams and madness, roars and whispers, wonder and horror, sacred and profane. I couldn't put it down. Perhaps some Spyder silk had glued it to my hand? The music references created a perfect soundtrack in my head. Read it. You'll love it."
2,Like a high schooler's spiral notebook,"This book held promise, and then left it at the door. What is left is the musings of a high schooler who felt the need to include every cleverly turned phrase ever jotted down in the spiral notebook between classes. They all turn up here, and even one of the main characters pays hommage to the source by carrying a notebook of her own. If only she had lost hers like the rest of us do. Goths have taken quite a hit lately, and it's a shame that many will see this book and think it's a summary of the subculture. Not every Goth is bound by the need to be pretentious and sullen. Not every Goth writer will disappoint quite this way."
1,Boring and tedious,"I bought the book on a whim. I love horror fiction and thought, ""cool, goth and horror."" Sounded like a good combination.Kiernan is a fine writer. She has an intense, lyrical style. But I just couldn't get into the characters. They sounded so self-absorbed and stupid. I was pretty stupid and self-destructive in my late teens and early 20's but, man, these characters are purely implausible and I got really bored with them fast.The only reason I finished the book was because I was driving from Chicago to Denver with nothing else to read. So it was better than watching TV in motel rooms. I quickly donated the book to the local used book store. Maybe there's a teenager or two that will pick up the book for $.50 and think the book is really fabulous and intense. Yay for them."
3,Silk,"I rarely read horror, but when I spotted a story involving spiders, I couldn't pass it up. The characters were all quite believable with their own quirks and foibles. Kiernan tells a good story and she does it well with twists and turns leading off in unexpected directions. My only gripe with the story is that the ""monsters"" are too ephemeral for my tastes, and I thought the ending did not do the rest of the story justice - it was the weakest part of the story.With that said, I recommend this author to friends and family!"
5,Kiernan rocks!,"This book is fantastic, especially if you're into writers like William Burroughs, Thomas Tessier, Kathe Koja, Poppy Z. Brite, Thomas Ligotti, Katherine Dunn, Douglas Coupland, or Jonathan Carroll. Silk hits you in the head and the gut like a chunk of concrete wrapped in velveteen. It's smart, brutal, and beautiful. From start to finish, Kiernan draws us into a surreal (or hyperreal) world, and if the ending seems inconclusive, you probably weren't paying close enough attention - Kiernan is one of the powerful voices of her generation!"
3,Funny But Gets Old Fast,Ok I have to say I laughed my ass off the first time I saw this movie.I have never laughed that hard before but then I bought the movie and all the dvd's of the series and while I like having them I got tired of them real fast.There just alot of the same crap.Ok puking is funny and taking a dump in a store is to but I just got tired of it.I recomend you rent this movie an skip buying it.Its only funny the first time round.
2,For buying this I am a,Not particularly funny or interesting. I have enjoyed several of the series on MTV and I expected the best of the best. Not so by far. Very little creativity in the stunts performed. A waste in my opinion.
1,Inane,"There was a time when wearing a chicken suit was sufficiently humiliating to get a camera pointed at you but, as we see in this movie, it's now necessary to drink urine instead. Perhaps next time we'll see a human sacrifice and no-one other than a participant in this movie is more deserving of such a role. It's not all that surprising to see geeks biting the heads off chickens - anyone with minimal talent and a thirst for attention will do it - the real question is why the audience would be entertained by such incredibly stupid behavior."
3,"Sophomoric, BUT we laughed like 10th graders!!!","It's crude, appalling and amateurish. But there are many shining moments! Johnny Knoxville and his band of merry morons take you straight to the depths of human stupidity and way across the boundaries of taste! But it's not suitable for children of ANY age!Steve-O is then most egregious offender (although it's a close contest!) in this depraved, disgusting foul-fest! It would have been great if there were more contributions from 'Wee Man', the resident dwarf.This is definitely entertainment at its basest, but some of it was still pretty hilarious!"
1,STUPID,"This was the dumbest movie that was every made! I read the reveiws prior to taking my teenage daughter and friends to this movie. I would not waste the money to go and see it, if I had known what it was about!"
1,WHAT'S THE POINT,"I Saw this idiotic movie, i'm still finding out how this movie is funny, destruction of property, loitering, seeing a guy bowl a ball with him at the end of the lane. Is this some kind of live action cartoon or morons doing stupid things to get some in trouble. Face it if you like Backyard Wrestling (which I don't) you would like this poor piece of [garbage] ""movie"", if you can call it that! no plot, no story, in mean to a reason to watch it, just people doing things, BORING, take it from me, Tom Green is the worstest comedie ever, and this ""movie"" should be dispose of!"
1,Makes Paris Hilton look like Albert Einstein,"This is like a male version of Paris Hilton but wihout the money, the class, and the IQ. It wouldn't suprise me if Al Qaida uses it as a training film to help terrorists kill Americans without feeling guilty."
5,They are nuts,"You've seen the show, and you probably think: ""the movie must be like the show."" Yes, it is like the show, but 100 times funnier! They'll do things you'd never expect. This movie will make you laugh, puke and laugh some more"
3,Funny but weird,"This DVD is a compilation of the normal antics which the Jackass crew is always committing. There are scenes which are very funny such as scene 37 "" the burglars"" in which two guys fall down the ceiling pretending to rob the place and one of the men working at the place begins running out the door at very fast speeds. This scene is very funny simply because of the reaction by the man... I suggest that if you do buy this movie, do not watch it with kids. The scenes are very graphic especially when they show Johnny Knoxville getting his head sewn up. Buy this DVD if you want to have a good time..."
4,Sucsess!,"Being a big fan of Jackass, Viva La Bam, and Wild Boys, I was very happy to see a movie of jackass. After watching 2 minutes of this movie u will already b rolling on the floor laughing. I only gave it 4.5 stars because there was 1 or 2 skits I didn't really think were funny.Here are my top 5 favorite skits:1. Golfcourse Airhorn (Johnny Knxoville, Dave England, Ehren McGeney)2. Party Boy Japan (Chris Pontius)3. The Gong (Preston Lacy, Johnny Knoxville)4. Big Cone (Wee Man)5. Night Pandas (Steve-O, Preston Lacy, Wee Man, ???)"
5,Buy it.,"The lack of overall plot and the ever-present love story that seems to be in every movie is a welcomed change. I guess thats all i have to say, everything else good has been said about this movie. Buy it :-D."
4,The best Reallity TV based movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Jackass: The Movie is possibly the most entertaining, disgusting, and side-spliting movie that I've ever seen. the reason they say ""the stuff you'll never seen on television"" because 1.it completely UNCENSORED & 2.the stunts are both danderous and absolutely disgusting. If you've watched the show on TV then you won't want to miss this."

If you've watched the show on TV then you won't want to miss this>"
4,It's only funny when somebody gets hurt.,"This movie was insane and funny. Everything the Jackass crew did was over the edge and hilarious. My only complaint is that some scenes were too long and I felt like saying, ""I get it."" I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if I wasn't sitting behind 2 chicks who would squeal ""ewwwww!"" every 15 seconds. If you like gross and brutal humor, check this one out. This was more like CKY then Jackass but it was still good."
5,the movie was the funniest thing i've seen in my life,"i recently saw a special showing of the film, and even if you don't like the show, you must see the movie, you can't even hear your own laughter over everyone else in the audience. when i left, my sides hurt, my face was killing me from smiling. a must see, anyone that doesn't has no personality. must see!!!!"
2,Coming from a Bam fan....,"Although I do love Bam Margera, I have to say that this movie was not all that. I'll admit, there were some parts that made me giggle, but most of the parts made me shake my head and say, ""What morons!""The movie gets old really fast, I must admit. I think it was just a scam to get more money since they knew they made it off the show. I don't see how so many people are like, ""LyKe OmG, tHiS mOvIe WaS lykE tHe GrEaTeSt MoViE eVeR!!!!!!"" because there was hardly anything humorous about it.I guess if you have that sense of humor, then you'll like it. But I personally do not find sand vaginas and the constant hitting of the testicles funny at all."
2,Don't be afraid to laugh,"I would give this movie a one star rating but I have to admit I laughed a whole bunch of the time. Why do I laugh? Because these morons decide to do the stupidest things to get themselves into a whole bunch of crap. But they'll do anything. Its even scary what type of idiots are on the street today, what sort of moron you might come across. Nonetheless, it was funny. And disgusting. But funny ...Overall: Watching it once is probably enough, the stuff they'll do will probably get old if you buy it."
2,These guys are stepping out of the closet before our eyes..,"If you want to see a guy eat a urine favored snow cone and then vomit, a toy car x-rayed after being lubercated and inserted in a man's colon, & an obese man and his midgit side kick run around nude. Then this is the documentry of morons made just for you. I agree that these days you have to do alot to shock an audiance. But when you have to look foolish, why bother? Yes the film was a box office hit, so expect sequels. Even though it's all in bad taste, for some reason it will attract movie goers. In Jack@ss 2, I'm hoping for a hot tub party full of bubbling sewer, and maybe they will dig up a corpse and make out with it. What ever happens I won't see it first hand, I'll hear about it second and that's bad enough. A hardly deserved 2 stars is all I could do."
4,Funny..yet disturbing....,"I had seen the show ""Jackass"" before and thought it was pretty funny but at times just gross.It's the same with the movie. Some of the stuff they did were just hilarious such as ""the shoplifter"" and ""butt x'ray"",while most of what they did was just plain disgusting such as ""Wasabi Snooters"" and ""the Yellow SnoCone"".And of course whoever is doing the gross stunts is going to throw up, and i just can't stand to see vomit so I was very grossed out by this movie.But there are some very hilarious parts,also."
1,Dumbest movie ever made,"This is by far the dumbest movie that I've seen so far. The only things in it that I thought were kind of funny were the parts where Steve-O is trying to go across the pit full of aligators with dead chickens strapped to his butt and the part where Jhonny Knoxville is trying out the rocket skates in the park. All in all I don't recomend this movie, it's just stupid."
1,Welcome to New America,"Remember the good ole days of comedy? Well, now we have Jackass The Movie. Based on the television show on Mtv (incase you kids don't know. It used to stand for Music Television). After Mtv dissed all the music videos off the air (except for at 5 a.m.) they made Jackass. A show about people hurting themselves for money. Then this vile disgrace of American culture came out 'Jackass the movie'. Be stunned : As a man eats a urine snowball. Marvel: As a man inserts toys in himself (not mouth). Laugh: As.... well, ok. Don't laugh. Infact DON'T buy this excuse for a movie. NO WONDER WHY FRANCE HATES US!!!!!"
1,Should have come with Vomit bags.,"Not for the easily offendedThis movie convinced that the MPAA is braindead. It should have gotten an NC-17 rating. What makes me even more upset is that this movie made so close to my hometown. It has given the area much unwanted publicity. To be fair I watched the movie before writing this review. Though many in their late teens to mid 20 will like this, if you like south park you still may be offended by this."
1,what has happen to our society,"America now is a lost generation. A bunch of white boys making complete idot's out of themselves out in public. Their giving U.S. a bad name to other countries. Also men are getting a bad. I wish the show ""Jackass"" would get canceled off of MTV."
3,One of the Funniest you will ever see,"I loved Jackass but there is no way I am giving it five stars. This is one of the funniest movies you will ever see. It's tacky, raunchy, disgusting, crude, and a lot more. The critics will tell you all that, but they don't tell you how you will laugh your butt off. The stuff these guys do is insance. They paper cut the webbing of there hands and feet, eat yellow snow cones, shot bottle rockets out there rectums, get shot with riot control gear, beat up by a female kickboxer, and so much more. It's definetly not for the week stomached or people young in age. I gaurentee you will like it and you will talk about it. It makes fun of our saftey based society and is one of the ultimate worse signs for attention an inflecting self pain on yourself. I love it though. Don't miss out on it."
5,What The World Needs,A Little Controversy Is Nothing. This Movie Isn't That Bad Other Than Some Stunts Where I Didn't Even Look. It Waz Hysterical Otherwise.
4,Funniest... movie... ever,"I knew I was going to get my money's worth as soon as I opened the cover and started reading the chapter titles- some of the more attention grabbing of which include ""Rent-A-Car Crash-Up Derby"", ""Yellow Snowcone"", ""The Bungee Wedgie"", ""Ass Rockets"", and ""Off Road Tattoo"". It's obvious that these guys will do anything- and I mean ANYTHING to get a laugh. And for the most part, it works. There are a few less-than-spectacular moments (Johnny Knoxville getting shot with a beanbag comes to mind), but there's some classic stuff in here (check out Dave England in ""The Muscle Stimulator"" or Jason Acuna as ""The Big Cone""). As has been said, don't rent or buy this expecting anything but a bunch of morons performing gross stunts for our (and their) amusement."
3,Complete nonsense...but it's funny nonsense.,"Losen up for 90 minutes or so and take a look at this movie. It's basically an uncut, extended episode of the MTV show (Well, used to be, at least) Those with weak stomachs or ones expecting any sort of plot should steer VERY clear of this.2 stars must be taken off for obvious reasons. It's crude, stupid, painful, any negative word can describe this 'film'. Also, some unfunny skits dragged on for a long time.However, some skits were hilarious, and that's the whole point of the movie- to get a laugh or two out of you.Watch it if you're a fan or the series, or if you just want some brainless entertainment."
2,"Funny at Times, But Not As Good As It Should Have Been","I am not a huge fan of the show. I watch it occasionally for a few laughs, and I thought the movie would be even better. Perhaps my hopes were too high for the show. The opening shot with the whole cast in one HUGE shopping cart, with Caramina Burana playing in the background briefly confirmed my hope that this movie was going to be awe-inspiring. What did I get? An average uncensored episode of the TV show. Oh well."
4,Really funny movie,"The ""Jackasses"" never let me down. They always have something new up their sleeves. I especially like Chris Pontius when he plays as ""Party Boy"". That is so funny."
4,hilarious yet still gross,"i bought the movie because i needed something stupid to watch and it is just that. i enjoy stupid funny movies at times and so whenever i am feeling down i put this in and it helps me out. there are some gross parts of the movie just like in the show, but you would expect nothing less from the group."
2,some good laughs on a crappy pile,why this movie was made thats up for me to find out..but anyways the jackasses are here with more gross out and stupid **it that you may or may not handle and some will find it offensive..idiots will find it funny..because they have no taste whatsoever...the funniest moment would have to be in the beginning where Johnny Knoxville rents a car and then demolishes it and returns it to the owner running away...then it gets into real lame and crappy humor.....
1,"""better than Citizen Kane""??? i don't think so...",I watched the TV show many times... i stopped watching it when I saw one of the Jackassess eating his own vomit (yeah! you readed it well)...I can't believe that someone compared this gross movie (where the Jackassess eat their own urine) with Citizen Kane.
2,playing with urine and fecal matter... is that the new wave?,"I recently watched part of this movie at a friends house and although there are some funny parts, I have a hard time believing how can someone ""get a kick"" observing some crazy guy playing with his own frozen urine and then eating it like an ice cream cone or even taking a dump in his own pants and then showing it like some kind of trophy.SOS America,wake up,you're becoming the clown of the world."
2,Boys Will Be Boys.,"Juvenile, undeveloped, bone headed, asinine, self loathing, pathetic, transparent, pack mentality closet cases inflicting self torture often involving genetalia and nudity, disguised as male bonding and ""har...har...har..."" outrageousness, in lieu of actually having gay sex with each other. Boys, stop hurting yourselves and just cross pork swords already! Geeessshhhhh!"
4,Exterminate all golfers....,"I pride myself on being a cinephile, yet, despite that, I love this film. It's hilarious. It's just a 90 minute version of the TV show, and it's brilliant. No effort is made to connect the stunts with some lame story, and I think that's the best way to make a film like this. Can you imagine if they tried to tie in a love story or something lame like that? Ack! My favorite stunt is the golf course airhorn. Being a very crappy golfer myself, the few times I have ventured on a golf course, I was met with derision and contempt by my fellow golfers. I slice terribly, usually into other fairways, pissing off the other golfers. It's so much fun annoying golfers. Golfers are such pricks! Screw them! They're all like Ted Knight's character from Caddyshack. I thought Johnny and the boys were too nice to them! The rest of the film is great, too, but I adore the golf course scene. Could watch that every day for the rest of my life (and beyond). Go Jackass!"
5,most h-y-s-t-e-r-i-c-a-l movie in a long time.....,"THIS MOVIE IS FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO LAUGH! NO OVERPAID ACTORS IN THIS FILM, JUST A GROUP OF GUYS THAT ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THEY SET OUT TO DO..MAKE THEMSELVES LOOK [stupid] WHAT A GREAT TIME WE HAD, I HAD CRAMPS FROM LAUGHING!..."
5,R.I.P. Jackass,"This movie is sadly the finale of Jackass. This is the last time we see Johnny Knoxville do those crazy shenanigans. Since he's in Hollywood now starring in movies such as MIB2. At least Jackass retires with style,it's a laugh from beginning till end. I think it's the funniest movie of all times.Jackass still lives on with this DVD and of course with the MTV shows Viva La Bam which stars Bam,April and Phil Margera,Ryan Dunn,Raab Himself,Brian Dicamillo and new to the faces of Jackass fans Don Vito and Wildboyz starring Steve-o and Chris Pontius."
2,Good Music - Pathetic Film,"The 2 stars is for the music alone. The movie is vulgar and pointless. I'm certainly no prude, but watching some guy do a bowel movement in public or another inserting toy cars into his hind end really isn't my idea of entertainment. Nothing is sadder than watchng a sorry group of druggies trying for the attention that their parents never gave them. If this what we've come to, then I'm sorry for all of us."
1,Fine if you like that kind of humor,I bought this dvd for a specific research need. This kind of humor simply is not my cup of tea. It is vulgar and peurile to me.
2,Its got its moments...but not worth it.,"Im a fan of the series but the movie fails in comparison.Sure it has its moments ....but its not worth it.Go out and rent it somewhere,or wait till its in the [$$$] bin at [a local store] in about a couple of years.If you think you want it for the xtras-well there not worth watching....there is only so many times you can watch that one guy(cant think of his name right now)rip his pants off and dance in front of a huge crowd of people.The only REALLY funny part in the movie is when Steve-O jumps into a ceiling fan.But other than that...your not going to laugh as hard as you would watching it on MTV."
2,"A few good laughs, but not as funny as expected","This movie (if you can even call it a movie), is a new low in what ""entertainment"" is these days. It's definitely one of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. Some of the stunts in the film were funny, but there was too much repetition. Too much nudity, vomiting, and ""other"" things that you need to see for yourself. I didn't find it to be as funny as it was hyped up to be, but it was a little entertaining nonetheless."
4,Serious Stupidity!,"This is worst movie I have ever seen but I have to admit that is also one of the funniest!The movie contains a bunch of pranks conducted by a group of ""Jackasses"" who will try just about anything as long as it inflicts pain or can kill them. It sounds absolutely stupid but I could not stop laughing and I consider myself a mature, educated and conservative adult. You will wince in pain, feel a few disgusted gurgles in your belly, and feel totally offended but you will still watch the antics of these crazy dudes!So sit back and remember those old days of insane fun just because you believe your young and invincible. Everyone has been a jackass at some point just be happy these dudes are doing it for everyone to see and not you!"
4,"""Jackass"" had me in stitches","I can't remember laughing this hard in a movie. Those guys are crazy, yet equally brilliant. It takes a lot of creativity to do what these guys do and I enjoyed watching them perform these wacky and hilaroius stunts. I am still recovering from the papercuts scene and the golf coarse airhorns, that was priceless."
5,when was the last time you laughed for an hour and a half?,"well, now you can. quite frankly, jackass is the funniest movie i have ever seen. and if you ask anyone who's seen it, measuring funny by laugh-amount, they'll say the same thing. the intro to the movie alone is worth the ticket price, the rest is icing on the cake. granted, most of the jackass stunts revolve around self-destructive and reckless behavior. but what are you worried about? you're not going to dislocate your shoulder from your movie chair. just sit back and enjoy. seriously, after this movie all of the jackass members deserve worldwide celebrity. they are all total heros. no spoilers here, just go see it. trust me!"
3,A mixed bag,"I recently rented this movie with my dad and uncle. There was no women there just men. I first discovered that the ""movie"" is just a bunch of skits merged with a cool opening into a medley of pure juvenial dudes. I loved the opening, and some of the skits such as the demolition of the rented car, destruction of the golf course and terorizing of Japanese citizens and parents plus many others that gave me a huge case of laugh sindrome. However I was grossed out and mortified like so many other customers by pee, poop and vomit and other skits (can't tell you what they are cause I'd get kicked off this site.) but you know what they are. I would think twice before purchasing this than renting it!"
2,"Moderately funny at some points, but goes to far in others","Jackass is funny when it comes to the crazy and creative stunts they do. I've always thought it was commendable how they put their bodies on the line to bring us a laugh, but...I guess Johnny Knoxville needed an R-rated movie to show his boys puking in restaurants and crapping in hardware store toilet models. I don't know how anyone can find that funny. I have a sick sense of humor, but this stuff went beyond my level.If there had been some kind of plot at least this might have gotten a 3 out of 5 for attempting something worthwhile for Jackass fans, but I guess that's to much to ask. It staggers blindly from one scene to another and, as I said before, Knoxville couldn't resist not having his most disgusting stunts put on film."
2,Why should I review this movie?,"A star rating would be inaccurate on so many levels to describe this ""movie"", so here is what I have to offer.See it if you enjoy the television show. It offers a few poop jokes, four vomiting scenes, crude stunts, male nudity, cringe-inducing golf-cart wrecks, concussions, and a guy trampoline-ing into a spinning ceiling fan, and other antics ranging from the daring to the raunchy, and more than once the skits just feel self-serving and bloated and unfunny, which is a killer for this movie.Avoid it if you would find these things offensive or disgusting to the point of dry heaving.And as for myself? I laughed...more than once,..."
4,Three Stooges for the Modern Times...,"I wasn't really that keen on Jackass the series. I could take it or leave it and when watchiong the movie I really didn't expect much. I was wrong, I hadn't laughed as much in ages.Sure, it would be easy to dismiss Knoxville and the others as mere idiots but, despite the MTV formula, the ideas are classic and recognisable to all who love slapstick - this is mearly a modern take on the Three Stooges, or Laurel and Hardy (though more painful!)My favourite parts are when the kid sets off fireworks in his father's bedroom or when Knoxville takes on tank-built boxer 'Butterbean' in a department store (and gets stitches in his head as a reward)."
2,Formulaic love triangle amid wartorn London,"The title of this movie is deceptive advertising, the war is a backdrop to a very predictable love triangle. There is about 15 minutes of decent action which recreates (but does not credit)the Point du Hoc battle. Robert Tayor is sincere but 10 years to old to be a Captain leading troops in 1946. Dana Wynter is pretty enough to inspire two manly suitors but oddly doesn't seem to have any real passionate feelings for either. The brit commando third of this triangle is likable but out of the picture for all but a few minutes at the beginning and at the end. In short, a chic flic spun with a not very compelling tried and true wartime love triangle. Solid actors try but fail with mediocre material."
1,Don't waste your time,"Michael Bay must have studied this film before he made his own execrable ""Pearl Harbor."" In both cases, the filmmakers cynically titled their product after a famous WWII battle although they were really more interested in developing a dull, cliched love triangle than honestly confronting and exploring the meaning, experience, and drama of a significant historical event. At least, Bay relieved the tedium with some action. ""D-Day"" director Henry Koster doesn't address the actual invasion until the final ten minutes or so of this overlong film, and by then it is far too little far too late. Robert Taylor, Dana Wynter, and Richard Todd deliver their performances with all the animation of store-front mannequins. Taylor is far too old for this role, but Wynter, at least, is very nice to look at."
4,Entertaining,"I love this movie - always have. I guess I'm more interested in the entertainment value than combat scenes (after all, ""From Here to Eternity"" is considered a classic and there is only a very small amount of combat at the end in that one as well). Of course, I would probably like any movie that had Dana Wynter, Robert Taylor and Richard Todd in it. Do I think this movie is Academy Award worthy? Of course not, but this movie is reminiscent of the old Hollywood love stories that I have enjoyed so much throughout my life and it has a wonderful cast."
1,Always check the reviews,"I will ALWAYS check with the reviews here on Amazon before I purchase another ""Classic War"" movie. I purchased this at Suncoast video and was expecting an epic WWII movie, you can all imagine my disappointment after sitting through 1-1/2 hours of this mess."
2,not a war movie,"This movie is 1 hour and 46 minutes long. There is about 15 minutes of war footage related to D-Day. The other 1 hour and 30 minutes consist of 2 flashbacks by 2 soldiers. The flashbacks have to do with the woman they love. Each man is in love with the same woman, and the two men know each other.I wouldn't call this a war movie. I would call it a drama/love story with a war theme on the side.When I read the movie description, I was uncertain about it. Since there was no way to tell how much ""love story"" there was, or how much war footage there would be, I decided to give it a chance. Instead of sitting through the love story, I fast forwarded through it, and I'm really glad I did. It saved a bunch of time, which I was able to use for other stuff.Try renting it before buying it, unless you like 85% drama/love story and only 15% war footage, which I don't.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on ""Listmania! Lists""."
1,SOAP OPERA,I purchased this thinking that it might be a mediocre war movie. It does not even rise to that level. It is merely a well acted soap opera. Good actors for that but no war film
3,Love story in a WWII setting,"A nice love story set in England at the toward the end of the war. There are some genuine human elements frequently avoided in war films, and they're covered realistically. The actors do a fine job. Visually it's a lovely film with the lone drawback of Robert Taylor cast in a role of a younger man. He didn't try to look or act too much younger (Holden's fatal flaw in Picnic), but the problem could have been avoided by just having the character be a little bit older."
2,Three handkerchief weepie,"You've got to feel a little sad for Dana in this one. Her American lover went home to his wife; her English lover trod on a bomb; and her father shot himself. Well, that's life I guess. There is some interest, but not a lot, in trying to figure out along the way how the story is going to get wrapped up. On the marginally plus side, it seems a fairly accurate depiction of how the war panned out for some women in Britain; and it captures something of the atmosphere on the home front. Not much about the action on the other front. I suppose most of the audience were pleased it hadn't happened to them."
2,sadly he mirrors his work,for a lenghty bio no new revelations.it just becomes clearer that he is as removed and vague as the characters he creates.
1,Bland and obsequious,Gussow seems more intent on showing how pleased with himself he is for befriending the playwright decades ago than in composing a serious biography here. Albee's various flaws and ups and downs are all neutralized in the name of friendship. A disappointing bore of a book.
1,Only for the inner circle,"Indeed this kow-towing book seems to have been written merely to please Albee's friends in the Hamptons, his family (what there is of it), and Albee himself. I sure hope Mr. Gussow got a party out of it."
5,Intelligent and insightful,"Mel Gussow takes the reader on a singularly intelligent, yet emotionally astute journey into Edward Albee's works and life. He also evokes the New York scene in which Mr. Albee began his career. A beautifully balanced biography of a major figure in the American theatre. I loved it."
3,"I, too, was disappointed","I would join C. I. Wilson in his opinion about this volume. I also found it plodding and tedious. I finally gave up.Somewhere this was recommended for me to read, but can't remember where. But I approached it with interest and was disappointed with the stories. My field is nuclear physics and the little bit of detail about the bomb development was interesting and helped me appreciate the conflicting emotions about it, especially the tragedy of its development and use over Japan. And the descriptive style of C. P. Snow is very good writing, but again, it just didn't grab my attention that other good novels have."
3,"An excellent kids game, but for anyone over 10, steer clear!","Desperados are robbing the Red River Bank. As Sheriff, it's your job to take them in - dead or alive.

5,Jonas Gustavson,"I attend a day camp with jonas and he is the best ever!!! He tells me a ton about the movies and what he'd like ot do with his life. I hope everyone will buy this movie, because I know the day it comes out I am going to rent itCATIE"
4,Surprisingly awesome.,I absolutely loved this film. Some of the content may have been a little scattered alongside the in-depth character glimpses and quirky one-liners. Definitely a contender for the next best favorite indie movie among hipster kids though.
5,Wonderful!,The movie is a must see! It is absolutely wonderful and the storyline is so exciting. The timing for when my order came in was also very fast!
4,"For some reason it reminded me of a cross between ""Juno"" & ""Donnie Darko"", I enjoyed it quite a bit. I say B","It's hard being the new kid in school. Caroline (Dennings) and her father move from a big city to a small town and she is not happy with the move. She starts an affair with her teacher, and meets another boy her age. This is a very hard movie to review. The first half was pretty slow, the second half picked up and the last 20 min was great. I'd compare it to ""Donnie Darko"", but not nearly as complicated to understand. There is enough in the movie to keep you interested and watching through the slow parts, and after the ending you will be glad you did. Overall this is a good movie, but not great, definantly worth watching though. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - I don't think I would.*Also Try - Donnie Darko & Paper Man"
2,yuck,"terrible...serial killer indie flick? dont watch. I have high standards and this didn't even entertain me for the night. also it ruins josh lucas, sad times"
5,Lost for words,"If you want to let the person in your life know what they mean to you, this verse does it in a manner which is beautiful, honest and sincere."
4,Too thick,Like the poem and how well it's made. Only thing is to thick to fit in a frame. I had to take part of the backing out so the back of the frame could slid back into place.
4,Very Helpful,"In the process of learning the medical transcription field, I discovered this little book on Amazon. It has been a real help--a lifesaver--in my studies!! I plan to use this book and others like it to further my studies in medical transcription and to take a job in the field, compentent as a medical transcriptionist!! Thank you!"
3,Take it or leave it,"This book will not tell much that you didn't already know or could have guessed. It is very simple and redundant. It did, however, serve to dissuade me from pursuing this path by informing me that: 1) it is a difficult thing to learn and do well; and 2) it pays the minimum wage. For this service, it was after all worth the $3.00 I paid for it."
1,mis-informed,I PAID FOR RETURNED SHIPPING AND I AM OUT OF MONEY FOR NOTHING.SIZE INFO APPEARED LACKING IN THAT YOU MUST ORDER A SIZE 3 SIZES LARGER TTHAN NORMAL AMERICAN STANDARDS.I AM NOW AFRAID TO ORDER ANYTHING BY E-MAIL.HUSBAND JOHN
4,Good Gift Purchase,I bought this for my Mom and she loved it. The reviews I read were right - it runs a little big. I ordered a size smaller and it fit perfectly. The seller was great. The item shipped quickly and arrived right on time.
3,wrong suit,"I love the suits, however, you sent me the embroidered suit, not in a petite size~! I gave it to someone else~! That was very disappointing. Usually, you are very good about my orders. Otherwise, all was o.k."
3,is that a way to talk?,"a book for New Yorkers - if you're from there, currently living there, once lived there, you will recognize the territory. Otherwise it will all be Greek to you (pastries aside)the writing is uneven, sometimes annoying, at times poignant. needed more time in the oven."
4,Lots of laughs,"I listened to this book on CD while driving, and I was often laughing out loud at some of the language and characterizations. Unlike one of the publishd reviewers, I found enough story to keep me attentive; and even if I hadn't, the characters, the talk, the absurdities were worth listening through all 11 CDs. I miss the neighborhood already...."
2,Wannabe,"This guy wishes he was Philip Glass or Steve Reich. He tries to be a modern composer but just doesn't come up with stuff that is that interesting. Its like he is trying to make elevator music for the modern world. I guess he had to be the one who sucks out of the group of modern composers, so everyone could use him as an example of bad minimalism."
2,Not Effective,"This didn't help in stopping from Nausea and threw everything during air travel from Delhi to Bangalore, IndiaIt's not so effective for Air travel"
3,product did not provide desired results. It was recomended by a friend,The product was easy to use but it did not do what was expected. My problem may be meor servier and surgery may be my last resort.
1,This MADE me sick,"Do not buy this product. It made me, and the 3 other people I was with, sick. We used it exactly as directed, and within half an hour we were all nauseous. We had to wash it off as quickly as possible to stop from being sick before we even set foot on the boat!I am not 100% sure what made us sick. It may have been the extremely over power odor or the oil soaking into our systems and actually messing with our equilibrium. I believe it was probably a combination of both, because while I did feel better after washing it off, I did not feel very good the rest of the day. Needless to say, I threw it out that evening."
1,I'll give it one more try,"I suffer from motion sickness when sailing in ocean swells. Looking for an alternative to traditional seasick pills, which always make me very drowsy (even the ""non-drowsy"" type), I decided to try Motion Eaze. My first time using it I got sick twice on a three hour sail, so it doesn't seem to work for me. I will give it one more try, however, since the last time out I allowed myself to get hungry, which can enhance the feeling of motion sickness."
4,Motion Relief,I purchased this to take along on a cruise. It is an oil to be rubbed behind the ear. It's perfect to take along and tuck into a purse or pocket especially if you don't want to take a pill. I like homeopathic cures better.
1,Smells funny.,"So my husband and I were going on a cruise for the first time for our anniversary, and while we were really excited, my husband was a little nervous about getting motion sick. You have to understand my husband gets motion sick in a car, on a boat, on a treadmill, on a plane, on the Indiana Jones ride in Disneyland! I ordered a bunch of stuff. He tried these drops once but the solution itself smells bad. Its like a weird herbal smell... He put on the psi bands right away so we dont really know how effective the drops were. The Psi Bands, and Sea Bands worked better for him."
1,I must have severe motion sickness.,"I thought I would try Motion Eaze since it was all natural, and doesn't interact with other meds. It took the edge off for me. I didn't actually have to throw up, though I felt as if I would. It was so-so for the general bus ride, UNTIL the bus started making sudden stops like in NYC traffic, and at the tolls. Then I'm sure I turned green, started sweating, had to blow cold air on me. So it probably helps those that have a mild motion sickness problem. If I were you, I would bring along the Bonine/Dramamine just in case. Wish I had!"
4,3 ans d'attente bien recompensser.,"Apres 3 ans d'attente les fans de korn on pu se ruer sur ce veritable monument qu'est untouchables. en effet les precurseur du neo - metale reviennent sur le devant de la scene avec leur 5 eme opus ""untouchables"". il se resume en 1 mots : epoustouflant. en effet on observe une veritable evolution dans ce derniere album, Jonathan a fait un gros travail sur sa voie et le groupe a prit de la maturité, le resultat est tout bonement geniale. Il n'est qu'un conseil que je puisse vous donner, si vous ne l'avait pas deja precipité vous chez votre plus proche disquaire."
5,KoRn does it once again!,"Once more KoRn comes out with a killer album that set new standards for music. From the opening song, ""Here To Stay"", to the last, this is a awesome musical experience. This CD is a must have for ALL KoRn fans, and something anyone looking for a new group to adore. Jonathan's vocals are spectacular, Head and Munky's guitars are as awesome as ever, Fieldy kicks serious tail on bass, and David, well, his drums are as great as ever. Don't miss this CD!"
1,"Untouchables, Unlistenable.","If you think Metallica's Load and Reload were bad enough, then listen to this awful cd by korn, I Used to like them, but thanks to their stupidity, they will never be brought again, and another thing this is for fieldly, Mariah Carey got something on youAvoid this cd like the flowers in the attic."
2,not so great,well the lyrics are ok and vocals too but riffs are terrible! slayer has made good riffs! they should listen to slayer more!
4,"nearly great, IN A LEAGUE OF their OWN","KORN HAVE REMAINED TRUE, unlike tool BEAT OFF ADNUSEUMS AND deftone NOTUNES weve got, lets race off and find the latest PRODUCER TO kinda like madona change,cause all THREE NEVER wases neverHAd A SHRED OF originalty nor any IMAGINATIONS, korn has the opposite problem SOMETIMES THEYRE TOO GOOD THAT WHY LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE TRY TO TEAR EM DOWN TO SIZE, SOMETIMES THE SONGS CRAWL like a tooth ache,THEIR WHOLE SALE APROPRIATIONS sometimes, seem muddled in DIRE hoplessness, BUT ATLEAST THEY SHOOT FOR THE RAFTERS,"
5,"this is not KORN, its metallica",metallica is one of my favorite grops sence 83' and there are still the best.
2,Korn Rocks :P:D,"I have always liked korn ever since they came out in 93'. I felt the 3 year absense of music since their debut of issues. I'm so happy they made this cd, and hope they never stop making great music. ROCK ON"
1,Im growing up in a bad time for music,Oh when I heard the earler korn I was estatic. But I never brought the cd. I didn't buy CD's then because I would get diapointed by them. But I thought this CD would be different. Boy was I wrong!!! Never again will I buy a Korn cd. They suck so much!!! Its catchy I have to give them that but the lyrics leave something missing... like a meaning or something to think about. This is one to give to your little sister when shes going through a punk rebel stage.
1,A good band gone to waste!,DON'T BOTHER GETTING THIS! IF YOU WANT KORN GET ANY OF THE OTHER CDS BUT STAY FAR AWAY FROM UNTOUCHABLES!
5,best yet,the songs on this album are so different from all the past songs. korn is truly growing bcuz these are awesome songs. they r so deep. this is the best album yet
3,Un-biased review,"I would first just like to say that I have nothing agaisnt Korn, I am a big fan of their old stuff, but also i do not worship them and i will not automaticly give this album a 5, like ive seen so many people do. Korn has given up a lot of their trademark sounds in making this album. I wouldnt even really call this Korn. It's deffinalty not what i would expect from the same guys that put out ""Life is Peachy"". And its not their heaviest album like they said it would be. Dont get me wrong though, its not a terrible CD, its just not Korn"
5,Well Done,"This album took alot of criticism from the media and fans. I love korn's older style but the new is just as good if not better. I can really see the resemblance. This CD is no Issues but I'de say it beats out almost all of the rest. Favorite tracks are 1,4,6,7,8,9,10,13. I hope their will be a follow up with the same style."
2,weak cd,"This is a weak cd. Im a huge fan of their self titled cd, and I think that FTL is a good cd too. Ive tried to like this one, but it is just weak, and lacks trademarke korn sounds....oh and its too soft."
4,GREAT CD!!,"This cd is just awesome. The production is unbelievable and makes Jonathan sound better than ever. There are two types of people who buy cd's. One type who will listen to whatever openly and the ""before they were big they were cool"" people. Frankly those people ... and won't like this cd but to people with a true ear for good music, pick this one up."
4,Korns back. . .and better than before.. .,"Only recently have I found this CD, oh sure I saw the big posters in shops when it first came out -but I never bothered listening to their songs.Until now.After listening to the voice of Davis on Queeno of the Damned, I thought I'd better go listen ot some of his music. I feel in love instantly. Since that day I've bought all of Korns CDs, yet Untouchables is, yto me, by far the best. Full of haunting songs with Davis strangly compelling voice, its amazing."
4,Different but not bad.,"Well in my hunt to ceollect all Korn albums, this was the last one I bought. I had gotten use to the slowish guitars and drumming. Now I listen to Untouchables and what do I hear? I hear pop, and techno, and industrial. I put this album down immediately.3 weeks go by, I pick it back up and wouldn't you know, it actually wasn't bad. Untouchables it not a bad album, it just takes getting use to. Track 11 sounds alot like KMFDM and Track 3 reminds me of some black metal. The only reason this gets four stars and not 5 is that I love the KoRn i learned to love, and this is alot like Metallica's St. Anger; A great album, but not what I expected from Korn."
5,Untouchables by far best album,I was truly excited when I heard Korn had a new album. The only bad part was I had to wait until it was released! The wait was well worth it however!!! Every hardcore Korn fan must add this to their c.d. collection. It is my favorite album!!!!!!!!!!!
5,...,I think that this album was really good. Jon Davis is really experimented with his voice and I like it. And its got some phat... bass lines. I think I would like anything KoRn puts out. They know how to make the music!!
5,Outstanding!,"truly brilliant! I have been an avid korn fan from many years, originally gripped by their self titled album. I loved the pure emotion that Jonathan showed in his singing, and the musical stylings of korn were very original in my opinion. Although they were let down by Issues, which seemed rushed, badly put together, and the songs were not on par with korns usual, Untouchables showed that Korn still had it. With every CD, korn have reinvented themselves, and Untouchables is no exception. All round brilliant album, favourite songs are ""Hollow life"", ""Hating"" and ""Beat it upright"" but the whole CD is good quality music."
4,HEAVY,"To me, this CD sounds like a combination of all the Korn CDs with the exception of ""Hollow LIfe"" and ""Alone I Break"", 2 sorta heavy ballads. ""...Break"" is definitely something new for the band because of Jonathan's singing.. and the lyrics are very good. ""Beat it Upright"" and ""Wake Up Hate"" are pretty heavy and like their old stuff. ""Make Believe"" and ""Embrace"" don't seem that interesting but other than that, this CD is great. If you like their other CDs, I don't see why you won't like this one. Now if the band would only work on the DEUCE dvd and it's horrendous problems..."
5,Best Yet,"Every new cd KoRn comes out with they seem to go 10 steps beyond what everyone expects out of them. And this CD is now exception. It is full of heavy melodic tunes. Davis's voice has progressed so much through the albums and sounds amazing on this one. Head and Munkey have the baddest riffs and sweetest little sounds on this CD. Fieldy and David seem to be in more sync with each other than on any other cd. This is KoRn's best album yet, much more rock and steady beat to it. If you are looking for the best CD ever...check out this cd."
4,What can I say? KoRn is back!,"When i heard korn had a new album i thought back to ""issues"", a big disapointment to me (as a hardcore korn friend). But when i got a listen to the first single i was hooked. All the songs remind me of their first and second album's sound. Which is a good thing to me, i love this album, and highly incourage you to buy it. The hard heaviness of KoRn is back, and i look forward to seeing them in concert to promote this album"
3,Decent,"Korn is a band that I think is okay, but I think they should know when to call it quits. After they release their upcoming record (which I hope is better than ""Take A Look In The Mirror""), I think that they should disband. I'm not being mean to them, as they think that pop music sucks as well. They should also split since ""Head"" found Jesus and decided he couldn't play with Korn any longer...Oh, am I supposed to write a review for ""Untouchables""? Anyways, ""Here To Stay"" is a decent song, but my favorite is ""Thoughtless"". ""Alone I Break"" is a song I hate, since this isn't the dark, bitter Korn that they started off as. I'd advise that you can buy this album if you really love Korn, or if you hate Korn and want to use it as a coaster. Otherwise, stick with their first three releases, when they were less overrated."
5,Amazing,"This CD was worth the wait. The guys put together an absolutely amazing work of art. They set out to please the true fans by making a CD that flows together with all sorts of new heights musically. The talent, although, amazing from the start has only sent them higher on the totem pole becoming in some cases legends in a genre of music that they basically created."
4,Rises above the rest...,"Although this band has created the whole ""nu-metal"" subgenre, as some music fans and reviewers call it, KoRn has managed yet again to rise above the bland and unoriginal bands that they have managed to inspire.Accept no imitations. KoRn is definitely ""here to stay""."
5,"Hence the name, these guys are hardly untouchable!","Clearly the masters of innovation, korn have once again recreated their sound to create a whole new breed of music! Korn's fifth soundbreaking release offers a far more indepth look into the creative process of these boys and how they are clearly the true pioneers of the music industry. Tracks like ""Wake Up Hate"", ""Beat it upright"", and ""Thoughtless"" are a more updated version of their old sound and other tracks such as ""hollow life"" and ""Alone I break"" offer more of an amience and relaxed sensation. Truely another great work from one of the greatest bands alive!"
5,KoRn - Untouchables,Untouchables is the best album by KoRn. The long wait for Untouchables was worth it. This CD is worth it's price.
1,R.I.P. Korn,"I'd like to start by saying that Korn is my all time favorite band. That being said, other than ""Here to Stay"" this album is insanely weak compared to their original stuff. I understand that a band needs to evolve to stick around these days, but I truly believe if they had kept putting out albums much like their self entitled or Life is Peachy they would be just as successful. I thought Issues was bad until i heard this cd. Im sorry to say this but I will have to retire Korn from my listening until they prove that they can kick some serious ... once again. But, not unlike Metallica, i dont see that happeningR.I.P."
2,"DOESN""T HAVE THE FLOW LIKE THERE OTHER CD'S HAD!!","This is a ok cd......but not the greatest.......follow the leader is the best they ever came out with & issues is 2nd to that. In Follow The Leader every song I loved, but this cd is [not good] compared to follow the leader.......i remcomend buying FTL if you don't own it already. I've been a KoRn fan along time and they can do better than this......it's obvious some of these KoRn fan's don't know what there talking about when they give this albumn 4 or 5 stars.......i mean come on this album only had about 3 or 4 songs i like the rest is just junk...... ..."
1,3 years for nothing,To be honest I had thought this new KoRn album was gonna kick ... but when I bought it I right away didn't like the way it sounded.I thought it was gonna be some metal like in their Self-Titled album.The reason it was not good is because all you could really hear is the same way te music sounded over annd over and over so it got anoying.The only song that at least sounds alright is track 14.Lets hope that the next album will be a promising 1.
4,eating lettuce while on a field trip to croatia submarines,"i am an old school korn fan, and for some reason even though korn doesnt sound at all like they used to i still like every new release they put out and ubntouchables is no exceptionrawk on mofos"
4,Impressive,"I am not, as a general rule, a huge Korn fan, but like everyone else, I loved ""Here to Stay."" Surprisingly enough (for me at least) the rest of the album kicked ... as well. Check it out."
4,Not as good as Issues but really cool !!!,"Korn is a really cool band they have weird singing, strange lyrics, and cool guitar and bass riffs. All of the songs were good but, there is a little difference in the style of their music this time around."
3,"Not their best, but not horrible","If you like hard but slower metal, this is easily the best album for you. But if you like their older music, this probably their worst. Some of their great new songs are in this album, but only a few. Only half of the album is great, some of the others are good, and then several are just not good at all. If you like the old Korn music, this isn't for you, but if you like their newer image and music, it's pretty good. It's my least-favorite though.1. Here to Stay- 10/102. Make Believe- 9/103. Blame- 9/104. Hollow Life- 9/105. Bottled Up Inside- 8/106. Thoughtless- 10/107. Hating- 7.5/108. One More Time- 8/109. Alone I Break- 9/1010. Embrace- 5/1011. Beat It Upright- 4/1012. Wake Up Hate- 2/1013. I'm Hiding- 8/1014. No One's There- 10/10"
2,they have done better,i think that korn's new cd is an ok cd but i know that their past cds have been much better. i think that all the songs sound to much alike and that they didn't have enough differences between songs. i will still like korn but i miss the old stuff.~sonia~
5,A-W-E-S-O-M-E,"great album,in my opinion the best album tied with s/t,i love all the songs,if u are a big fan you should have bought this cd on june 11 if u are not you should check it out,its a great cd,vocals are amazing,jonathan davis sounds so good.if u love vocals and melody along with heaviness u should love this cd"
2,"What Happened To The ""Old"" KoRn???","I've listened to KoRn for forever. I love em, but what the heck happened to ya? This doesn't even sound like the same band. The ""old"" KoRn was MUCH better than this, go back to it!"
5,Korns Untouchables,"Korn is an awesome cd. It blends all of their sounds into one. Close to being my favorite korn cd if I could pick one. I bought it the 11th and it hasn't left my cd player once. I suggest ya buy it, one of the only cds you can find where you can listen to it all the way through."
4,Wow.. that song was kind of dirty...,"Finally koRn released their 5th album. Push back after push back and almost 3 years later, Untouchables finally came to life.After hearing the first single ""Here to Stay"" I knew this album would bring back the raw power we heard on self-titled and Life is Peachy.I couldn't have asked the guys to make this album any better. Whether you like your music to have insane sexual content, or you like to hear blatant screaming at things gone wrong, this CD is for you. I recommend this CD to anyone who even remotely likes the 'metal' genre. I guaruntee you will not be disappointed by this CD. I know I wasn't."
5,Another great album,"Three years since theyre last album ,and they've come back better then ever. I've been a korn fan for a long time... and although i usually prefer the older KoRn [first album][<-- altough i love all KoRn albums], I found Untouchables to be diffrent from what im used to from KoRn, but extremly good. It seems like KoRn has taken a diffrent aproach when creating this album, both lyrically and instrumentally. It seems heavier in many ways, but still has that authentic KoRn sound to it. I didnt know what to expect after three years without putting out an album.. but the wait was definatly worth the while .KoRn has once agian proved that they really are ""here to stay""."
5,One Of The Best,"This is not just one of Korn's best CDs, but one of the best CDs released thus far. Korn's flawless transition from Issues to Untouchables is, well, untouchable. The Korn fans wanted a heavier album, the band was more than happy to give it to them. Untouchables is an experience to say the least, I have listened to it at least 10 times already and I got it on Tuesday. Music making at its best."
3,Korn's Masterpiece???,"In the April issue of Guitar World, Korn memebers said ""This is our masterpiece"", yeah okay if you like listening to the same song through the whole album. I like a few songs on this cd but they all just sound alike, as an artist of music I like creative, something this album lacks. Some standout tracks are ""Here to stay"", ""Thoughtess"", and ""Hollow Life"".Jess"
5,Korn is back with a bang!,"After the release of 1999's Issues, Korn kind of dissapeared for about 2 years. Countless numbers of people would come up to me while I was wearing a Korn shirt, and ask me what happened to them? Well, now their back, and their new CD is nothing less than anything else they have put out. Untouchables is possibly one of the heaviest CD's I have ever heard. It's sound is totally unique, and Jonathan DAvis actually sings on most of the tracks! Untouchables is definately worth the money you pay for it. I would recommend it to anyone, a fan of any music style."
3,Just A Cut Below The Norm,"Having been a Korn fan for five years this week, since the Follow The Leader was released in 98, I looked forward to this, since I totally dug their fourth album, Issues. However, the record just didn't seem to deliver on many levels. Sure, the opening single, Here To Stay, had some of the panache that Korn fans might expect, as did the second single Thoughtless, but a lot of the tracks on the album seem to miss the thoughtframe of Korn, relying instead simply on a heavier brand of music. For anyone interested in buying the special version with remix, let me discourage you. I haven't heard a worse mix since the terrible ""New Old stuff"" of Limp Bizkit."
1,Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge KoRn fan, but honestly, they've gone majorly downhill since the days of Follow The Leader. They exploded onto the scene with their self-titled debut. Jonathan made it clear that KoRn was here to say (oh, the irony). But, honestly, each album carries less of the original, which is rather depressing. They've gone soft as far as music, though the lyrics are pretty good. I think it's time for Jonathan and the guys to return to the old sound or just put down their instruments and walk away with what little dignity they have left."
1,Enough Already,"I can wholeheartedly say that Korn represents pure hate better than any other band currently. Unfortunately, there is nothing original about their delivery or their sound. There is no outcome, solution, or message inherent in the songs, just emotional despair - despair that starts to sound like whining after the umpteenth song about hate, hate, hate. They have made a career out of profiling teen angst, while their songs are on second glance, vacuous. The shows bite, the atmosphere is depressing; Axl Rose and/or Mike Patton did vocal ventriloquy better than Davis ever could, and the current crop of Top 40 anger bands are thin, untalented shadows of them. At least they celebrated their anger rather than regurgitated it to the extreme."
4,untouchables is awsome,untouchables aint as good as follow the leader but its got some killer beats and awsome bass lines.just about every song is sumthing to headbang to.
4,progression,"I think that this album shows that they've grown as musicians, and they've bravely did something totally different at the same time than what might be expected. Untouchables may take a few listens to really get a feel for the songs, but I think that it really grows on listeners."
5,GREAT CD,"Untouchables is a great cd and a must have. The cd has 14 kick...tracks and one bonus track which is a remix of their single ""here to stay."" Another great plus of the cd is you can watch the video for ""here to stay"" on your computer when you put the cd in your computer. You will also be able to join the korn kamp until september 15 for free. Every track on this cd is great and this album is definitly one of korn's best. After waiting three years for a new album i'd say that the wait is definitly worth it pick up Untouchables now."
1,Horrible,"korn fans are like a cult. Korn lost the little talent they had after their first cd. And somehow they've managed to become MORE depressed and messed up. Ya wanna know how? It's fake! They're new stuff is grunge with repditive shallow lyrics. If your a member of the korn cult, pick up this cd. If you wanna follow around the korn cult and be ""cool"" too, pick up this cd for 20 bux. Or maybe you wanna have your own opinion about it and ACCUALLY think on your own, get a real CD."
3,Inchoate yawp,"not to be missedif toure a glutton for punishmentAND, if youve missed hearing morrisey wail"
5,Korn Rulz,Well the have managed to pull it off again this album is very good.I think that this album is awsome because it is so hard Its harder then any of their past albums even their debut.I think that this album is going to be the best of 2002. And if you havent bought it i would suggest that you go get it right now because this cd is awsome.Korn is here to stay and so am i as a fan
1,Terrible,"..., unlistenable followup to the Stellar ""Issues"" CD. They spent 4.5 million to make this piece of ...?! One or two decent songs, and the rest is just the same rehashed riff that has defined ""nu-metal"" for the past few years. Don't waste your money."
1,the emperor has no clothes,"I am a metal fan. but this album and the whole scene right now is a big disappointment. I believe the end of the world is coming soon if people think this is good metal... It seems all contrived and redone and polished in the studio. no surpises, no songs with any messages of value. Just sell the albums to dopey kids who are willing to buy them. Whats next, Korn is going to have their own fashion show?? Put another string on their guitars and take some voice lessons and maybe you will have a group. Thank goodness it will be over soon."
1,Kreamed Korn,"Korn has always [stunk],but they sink deeper into poseurdom withUNTOUCHABLES. No matter how hard they try to sound ominous,it'sconstantly ruined by Jonathan Davis's self-indulgent whining.I could barely stand to listen to UNTOUCHABLES; it's absolutelyawful and utterly bereft of intelligence and artful thought; this CD just glorifies meaningless rage. Quit listening to Kornand discover intelligent bands like Circle Of Dead Children andIntense Hammer Rage."
5,Korn Still Rocks,"Korn slightly changed their style again on their newest Cd. And It's pretty dang good music. I like there older stuff best. (Life Is Peachy, and Follow The Leader) are their best albumns I think. But this one is still good and worth buying."
1,KoRn Lost It's Kernel...,"I can't belive what I'm saying, but this album is so terrible it's sad!! It pains me to think the ONLY song on the disc is ""Here To Stay"" but it's true. I have never disliked any KoRn album (and never thought I could). To make this as painless as possible...I feel like I just ran thru a KoRn field backwards.You to will feel KoRn-Holed after you buy this insult of a new album!! KoRn needs to drop the K and spell it CoRn. Don't get me wrong...Of course after you wasted your hard earned money on it, you will try to make yourself believe that you actually like a song or two on it. But deep down you'll know the KoRn legacy is over. I know what your thinking...Either I don't know what I'm talking about or you have to hear it for yourself to believe it. Well guess what...I said the same damn thing!! Good luck and see ya in the funny papers if you take your chances!! You've been warned!!"
1,Please This Is The Worst Korn CD,"I don't know what you people are thinking saying this is a good cd. You must be all those people who came up to me when follow the leader came out and said ""Have you heard Of Korn"" F yes I did. They came out in late 94. Once Life is Peachy came out and addias became a hit they have lost their touch. I remember in 95 they were opening for megadeath. WHO REMEMBERS that? Also in 96 they played a small club in nashville and did not sell out tell an hour before the show and were playing with THE URGE of all bands. I never thought i would ever right a review like this about korn but they have gone commercial which is acceptable to a certain extent everyone needs money but they have lost their og style! What happened to ""ARE YOU REEEAAADDDYYY?"" After i seen the 1st family value tour 3X i gave up on Korn and understud they were not the same. I will admit though that after Issues i had hope but they let us real og fans down. Korn you are a clown."
1,This is a plain crap,"Well, well, well.I went to they concert ones, oh my god. I still have a headache till the present day. I thought that I came to psych hospital facility instead of concert.This is not a music. It can't be called rock or metal or anything else. This is a noise for people who are using drugs on daily basis. These Korn guys looks like on high doses also. And they have no talent at all, just hit the strings, and synth does the rest. Also listen to lyrics, my goodness, where we go? Hopefully great musicians like Dio, Iron Maiden and others still exist."
1,They STILL [stink],"And you might think after many years of bad music [they] have improved,well that isn't the case here.Don't waste your time or money on this."
3,"Typical Korn, but good.","As a casual fan, I find ""Untouchables"" to be mostly for fanatics. Overall I call it good, but there's only three tracks I really find to be great. Coincidentally those are the singles, ""Here To Stay"", ""Thoughtless"", and ""Alone I Break"". All three are excellent. The rest, decent. Other casual fans may want to pass on this album, since two of those three songs are on ""Greatest Hits Vol. 1"". So, unless you're just dieing to have ""Thoughtless"", which is awesome, I probably wouldn't touch ""Untouchables""."
3,A few good spots,"KoRn was the first band that I liked, ive been a fan of them for years. And before you judge this album too harshley, just note that all of their cd's have had a different sound to them.But id say this is their worse Cd. I liked 4 songs on it, but the rest were just techno voice overs that could only be done in a studio.Here to Stay, Make Believe, Hallow life and thoughtless are the only standouts on this Cd.The New Cd comes out soon, it will be much better than this one."
2,Untouchable... more like Unbearable!,"OK Korn's first and second CDs were groundbreaking and should be in every heavy music fan's collection but I guess it's true that success can make you jaded. This new CD is very weak musically and lyrically. The Amazon reviewer hit it right on the head.I dont think Korn can ever match the innovation of thier first 2 efforts. David sounds like he's bored, and the other guys in the band just dont have that fire and creativity they use to have. Looks like Korn have made thier millions and now it's time to give upthe music and live out the rest of thier charmed lives."
2,Disappointed,"Even though Korn is my favorite band, I was disappointed in this album. I tried to like it but I just couldn't. It just doesn't sound like Korn. When the ""Here to Stay"" came out, I had high hopes cause that song did rock, but the rest of the album is just bland material, its like they tried to do sappy rock ballads on some of the tracks. But I'm glad to hear that on the next album they're going back to their roots, so if you wanna check out Korn, just skip this one and get the self titled debut or ""Issues."""
2,Just Doesnt Stack Up,"This was touted to be KoRn's hardest album to date. I was PSYCHED when it came out, but when I listened to it, I was GREATLY dissappointed. Please dont get me wrong, I love kOrN, have all their other albums, and have seen them live, but this album just does not stack up to the others. If its your first KoRn album you will LOVE IT, but you MUST get their self titled debut album, KoRn and Issues. Then you will see what I am talking about."
5,Korns Second Best Album,"Buy this if you like nu metal. Korn's second best, if you dont already have it get it. It not wothout is flaws though, stay clear of beat it uright, one more time and blame."
4,Great Album,"Pretty good album, not the best but its still pretty good. There is too much depression in the album and that doesnt make it a top notch cd like Issues, or Follow the Leader. They should of put some louder guitars but this will do. Great album its currently #7 in the charts and its kick a** album wit some good hits. Suggest u buy it, go to a concert and bring some earplugs because i went to their concert and that is the loudest concert i have ever been to. Great concert reviews, and Cd reviews. Check out koRN.com for more info"
5,Winning A Critical Fan,"Before, I could live with or without any Korn album. I had no opinion of them whatsoever. Being a heavy rock musician myself, I was familiar with most of their music, but for some reason it didn't really grab me until I listened to Untouchables. This is a completely new Korn from what I had heard before. The guitars are so much tighter and more creative, the overall mix is better, the vocals are unbelievable, and the songwriting and studio production have improved massively. I really didn't expect to see the day when I would consider myself an actual FAN of Korn... After listening to Untouchables, I am already biting my nails waiting for their next release."
3,"Are they ""Here to Stay""?","When I first heard the Korn album, I was amazed! The album was great. I could feel their energy, but unfortuneatly, I could not feel their power. I felt this album was a little ""sloppy"" in terms of Korn's sound. It is a nice album, but not the best they've done yet."
5,KoRn ... new and improved,"The long awaited ""Untouchables"" is finally here. I personally have been playing this album over and over. I have found that this album shows a big lyrical and musical group in KoRn. KoRn has gone from Great to even Greater. They have surpassed even them selves once again. They have shown that they aren't going to follow the leader, but instead, be the leaders themselves. Some have credited KoRn with bringing out this nu metal trend, but now it seems that they're trying to stay away from that. KoRn has done it again and have managed to reinvent themselves once more. KoRn is definitely here to stay."
3,step it up,"being a HUGE KoRn fan, this is hard for me to say, but i believe that UNTOUCHABLES is their worst album. it doesn't meet the standards of issues or their self titled albums, so if you are new to the KoRn scene i would start with one of those. but KoRn still rocks and it still has the feeling of the band, their style of music just changed a little bit. i would say that TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR is better than this one as well."
1,Big disappiontment,"I was, and still kinda am, a Korn fan, but this album was such a big disappiontment. All the tracks seem to blend together and by the end of the album, I had fallen asleep. This album is far from the groundbreaking and memorable sound of the first two albums. I just hope that their next album's songs are actually distinguishable or else I'm going to rip their sticker off of my instrument case."
2,Are we listening to the same album?,"I'd give it 3 stars, but I feel compelled to offset all the 5 stars that people are tossing out like candy.I think this is Korn's weakest offering to date. It's OK, but a certain sameness permeates throughout. For me the only standout track is 12.This album doesn't have the raw power of #1, the anarchaic quality of #2, the power and innovativeness of #3, or the amazing riffs of #4.Most dissapointing is the overall rythym. On many of the songs the rythym section could just as easily have come from a drum machine and sequencer.Korn's now sounding a lot more like everyone else. Is that good or bad? You decide. This is an OK album. Better than a lot of the other stuff out there. For me vaguely disappointing considering thier previous stuff. Is thier best now behind them?"
2,Dissapointed,I have been a KoRn fan for years and greatly anticipated this album. I was almost embarassed as a KoRn fan when I heard it for the first time. The raw energy and emotion is lacking in this album.
3,Good Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am not a real korn fan it is just I heard there new song ""here to stay"" I actually liked it was cool and I also heard there album personally I thought it sounded all the same but if you are a true rock fan go ahead and buy there cd you will not be sorry,so BRING IT DOWN!!! With there music!!!!!!!!!"
1,Buy This CD...,"One of the most notable aspects of Korn's music is that it has continually evoloved. Some bands constantly churn out the same material and ultimately stagnate. Don't get me wrong, this CD is most certainly Korn; i.e., Fieldy's percussion style bass, etc.. But, Untouchables is certainly the current pentacle of Korn... My personal favorites off the CD are, Here To Stay, One More Time, Embrace, and I'm Hiding. The song Hollow Life, alone, has added a new dimension to Korn while at the same time showcasing the bands incredible musical talent.... In other words, Buy the CD!!!!!"
2,"Newer, but not exactly better.","I've always been a big Korn fan, I hooked in about the time that Follow The Leader came out. Anyways, when I heard that Korn was coming out with their new album, I rushed to the store to get it. Came home, popped it into the stereo, and all I got was disappointed. While the album has its few good songs, overall its not my cup-of-tea. I prefered Life Is Peachy and Follow The Leader to their new one. I think the band wanted to make something new, something that took it in a new direction. Bad move. Although it does have its good songs, like Here To Stay, Im Hiding, and Wake Up Hate, the majority of the songs were below average.If you're an older fan of Korn, I dont recommend this one."
2,Same old stuff,"Is it just me, or does every Korn album sound exactly alike?? I'll give em credit because they were at one time ground breaking and original. Korn's 1st album set a new standard for up and coming metal bands. But now almost every nu metal band sounds just like them. They're not really a bad band, they're just stuck in a rut. All their songs sound exactly alike - the same guitar riffs, basslines (Fieldy is a pretty good bassist), drumlines, and same whiny vocals. If you have one Korn album you have them all."
1,NU-METAL REIGNS SUPREME!,"This is the new Korn album. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you surfed to this page on accident. If you are truly dense and must hear this, borrow it from one of your mooky pals."
2,untouchable?,i bought this album thinkig it was going to be great what a letdown. this is easily the worst korn album ever when issues came out that was quite a let down to but this is just PANTS. if you dont have all the korn ablums dont bye this one buy one of the other far superior albums as buying this is just a waste of your cash!!!!
5,One of KoRn's best!!!,"When I first heard this album I was so amazed. They had totally changed into a new style and nobody can even touch them now. This much anticipated album has to be one of the greatest album's of all time. If you like KoRn or you're wanting something new, I suggest you buy this album."
1,Pure Overated Crap,"I wish I could give this CD 0 stars.The Fake Metal band every REAL metalhead despises is at it again with another crapfest of thrown together hooks and neverchanging guitar riffs. The drums are slow as a fricken turtle and he couldn't go any slower with those clicky ass double bass drums. Johnathan's voice couldn't get anymore annoying. He sounds like he has a twig up his ass and I want to punch him because he sucks. Fieldy is a pretty good bassist, I'll give him that but he should join a BETTER band, like Cryptopsy. If you think this CD is heavy, prepare to be blown away and listen to something really heavy, like BREEDING THE SPAWN by SUFFOCATION."
1,boring and crappy,I dont know what happened this cd really really really sucks the only good song in this is Bottled Up Inside... wow what happened KoRn?
1,Used to be a big fan,"I loved 'issues', it was inventive for them and fairly cinematic with odd hooks. Their original disc has great songs. 'Life is Peachy' was great when very angry and 'Follow' was kind of fun in a sick way. Untouchables is really unappealing to me, all the songs are just dull, like it's a parody of the band, I thought Jon was supposed to be more mellow from the prozac?I think they need at least one decent guitar riff, make new instrumentals, find a new way of expressing with better, less blunt lyrics or do not continue making music. Do something exciting, maybe a concept album with drawings or SOMETHING new. Get a haircut maybe, I dunno..."
5,Great CD,"Korn has been around for a long time now. Their music hasn't changed but Untouchables is by far the best of them all. Songs like 'Here to stay', 'Blame', and lots more are great. Be sure to buy it."
5,Sell your soul for it!!!,"this cd is awsome. kick [rear] even. theis is Korns best work yet thier other cds like Life is peachy and Follow the leaded, were all awsome but Untouchables is the best yet. its 14 heart pounding tracks of pure emotion and skill. this is by far the best cd yet of 2002 infact one of the best cds of all time if you cant aford it sell your house your dog your cat even your little sisters soul so you can get this excelent cd."
3,KoRn strikes again,"This album is nothing compaired to the previous four, and so it deserves nothing over a three. On the plus side, it's still awsome, even though not as much, so it deserves more than nothing. Here To Stay and Wake Up Hate are extremely good. Those songs alone make this album worth buying. But trust me when I say this: get Follow The Leader first! It is so much better."
3,Not As Good As Issuses,"KORN, UNTOUCHABLES is good album but as not as good as the album before this, ISSUSES. ISSUSES is one of my favorite KoRn albums. Untouchables on the other hand isn't one of my favorite albums. I became a KoRn fan after FOLLOW THE LEADER came out. This album doesn't capture the feeling of ISSUSES. This is one of those of those albums that only a few tracks are good."
2,Don't Change!,"Satisfactory, is the only best describing word I could use for this album. When Korn first came out, they were new to the nu-metal scene they were change from grunge. Their first few albums were classics, now they have changed their style of music to compete with various ... like Linkin Park and Sum 41 which does not compete with Korn's classical old style. I think they have had there day and they are just trying to keep in the runnings of the new millenium bands, which in my view are utterly ... maybe it's me or is there no room left in the world for decent music. Unlike this new commercial farce of nu-metal."
5,KoRn gets deeper,"And ""deeper"" in this case means good... The energetic elements of funk and rage are present like usual, but they have evolved and produced a deep and rewarding set of dark tracks. ""Untouchables"" is intense and twisted and in Jon Davis' world there seems to be no hope left. KoRn knows just how to blend together low bass riffs, chainsaw guitars, creative drummung and haunting vocals that range from whining to majestic shoutouts.One of the best albums of 2002 and maybe the best of KoRn? This one is a keeper..."
5,"Great Cd, And Ways To Know The Ratings of 1 * r by non fans","To begin this Review, I am a very huge KoRn Fan. I respect their music fully, and I HATE that this is their last cd ever. I really enjoyed the ride they gave with hits like Blind, Got The Life, Make Me Bad, A.D.I.D.A.S., Freak on a Leash, and more. Untouchables is a great cd to end their run in the Metal Rock Business. This album is by far a must have. One way to know the Ratings that are given badly are by Non-Korn fans, is when in the whole Review...they dont know the correct spelling of KORN. Instead they use CORN. Second, they can't even name one song Korn has produced before Untouchables. So when you are in the buying mode, IGNORE these people, and only listen to the true fans. This cd is a very great cd...given a very nice stars."
2,Very Dissapointing,"i like korn a lot, as a matter of fact they're one of my favorites. but this album is no good. not one track sounded good to me. there were a couple that i found almost listenable. what happened? his voice is different in this and there are no drums. it's all synthesizer. my favorites are issues, follow the leader, and their self-titled album (awesome cd). this album is not like any of those. no talent was displayed on this album."
5,"KoRn has done it again, even edited!","This cd is an awsome, although the explicit one is better! Either way if you don't like cussing, but you like good music, buy this, but if you want it all, buy the real version! You won't regret it, because this is one of KoRn's best cd's!!!"
1,"I really like this, it ranks up there with zeppelin,","I heard J Davis got voice lessons, cant you tell? Boy, from the first single I thought it was Korn featuring Robert Plant. His voice is amazing. And Fieldy is getting so much better at the bass, and the Head guy is shredding out beautiful power chords. Korn rocks, I've never been to a Korn show, but if my mother ever let me go, I would meet my boys of Korn and ask them how come they are so remarkably talented and how Davis can get his voice to sound like he was being pinched by a crawfish. Korn will SAVE ROCK AND ROLL. we need more bands like Korn, well wait... I shouldn't complain, we do have Paparoach, limp biscuits...you get my point. Real music fans love korn.Let me rate the songs for all you::::1. Here to stay - Terrible an absolute mockery of everything rocknroll once stood for2. Make believe- Terrible. Davis whines like my sister-3. Blame - This is music? How do they figure???4. Hollow Life - Stop whining already.. PLEASE....."
1,Unoriginal!,"I'm sorry, but these guys are just trying way too hard to sound like Adema. I have no idea who these guys are or where they came from, but they might as well just go home now, because there is no chance that they will ever go platinum."
1,Absolute GARBAGE!!,"Korn is like alot of some cool fans before TRL decides to market them to snotnosed 13 year old kids who claim they are the greatest band, if you want a good band listen to bands like Aerosmith the Beatles bands that can stay together and not sell out. I made the mistake in byuing this new cd hoping that it would be good I was dead wrong it [STINKS] the only good song is the 1st one. The rest of the cd is Jhonathon Davis winning and moaning like a 2 year old baby. Come on Korn you graduated Berkley College for MUSICANS Act like it not like Sell Outs"
1,Not worth the money.,Cd is not worth the money to buy it. Plain and simple. Don't waste your money on this cd.
2,this album SUX!!!!!!!,"Korn are my favorite nu metal band.Us Korn fans waited 3 years for a new album and we got THIS!There are 5 good songs on here.""Here To Stay"",""Blame"",""Thoughtless"",""Alone I Break"",and ""Embrace"".All the others are boring.The riffs are lame and the songs are NOT as heavy as the old Korn.""Here To Stay"",""Blame"",""Thoughtless"",and ""Embrace"" can all be found on the Korn Live DVD.""Alone I Break"" and ""Here To Stay"" can be found on Greatest Hits Vol.1.Do not waste money on this when you can get the 5 good songs elsewhere."
1,Bring the old-school back!!,"This is by far the WORST KORN ALBUM EVER! Forget about the rage and emotion from the first 2 albums. Korn can be defined by their first 2 albums, period, the rest of the ""experimentation"" side of the band is pure crap, where are the dark, sick and full of emotion Jonathan's screaming? where is the funky-fast riffs of ""Divine""? forget it, it' gone! When i started listening to Korn (back in '94) I was amazed by the refreshing and incredible sound, specially for the emotion on the lyrics and the singing...but now, everything is about money, MTV and fame...just like in the song ""Got the Life"" but the saddest part is the video clip for that song became real...so sad. I still dreaming of that crazy wild Jonathan wearing sequined Adidas track-suits on-stage and screaming his guts out while he was singing from the bottom of his heart...but those days my friend, are gone."
1,"Same old, same old.","You'd think after 10 years, Jon would have something better to do than whine some more. The sound is thicker and heavier, yes. But lyrically, they haven't grown much since 1992.The bass line about halfway into ""I'm Hiding"" sounds almost exactly like ""Here to Stay""'s bass line."
5,Untouchables,"this is a wonderful cd as i thought it would be , you can tell the band really mutured *not that thier other cds wernt fantastic too* jon and his volcals on this cd are amazing the way he uses his voice beautiful and the lyrics are incredible the gutairs on this cd arnt bad eithier of course my opinion this cd is a must have ALL korn cds are so run out and get them!"
5,Best cd ever,If you like hard rock you will love this new cd from Korn. It is the best new cd of the year. It seems that everytime Korn puts out a new album they manage to blow away there old ones. If I were you I would buy untouchables even if you never liked Korn in the past you will like them now.
1,Don't Bother,"Korn have outdone themselves by releasing what is not only their worst album, but the worst album i have ever had the displeasure of owning, i sold it to some kid for 5 bucks. This album is the worset album of the year, don't buy it."
3,"Worst Korn CD So Far, But Alright.","I like all of Korns Cd's, but this one was the worst by far of them all. Its not bad,but it is by far the worst they have made yet. Here to Stay, and Thoughtless are probably the best songs here. I listed the order of all the korn cds1.Follow the leader ( BEST )2.Korn ( Close to #1 )3.Take a look in the mirror4.Issuse5.Life is peachy6.UntouchablesBefore getting this one, get the first Korn and follow the leaderfirst."
2,They continue to disappoint.,"Now don't get me wrong I loved Korn's early work, Life is Peachey is still one of my favorites, but they are really losing their energy on their last two albums. Really Follow the Leader was there last good album. Issues was a mess. Untouchables is better but with only so few great songs on the album we have go to worry where they are heading. We all know they can do better. Anyone that things this is a great album is in denial about this band. Unfourtanetly this will probably be the last Korn CD I buy. When the only good songs on a CD are the ones on MTV why buy it?"
1,What were they thinking?,This is the most horrible cd by korn definately (Issues ... too but at least had 2 good tracks on it). Old school korn lovers will hate this album. The old harder stuff by korn is awesome....this just plain ... There isnt really a good track on the whole cd. I dont know where korn is goin with this new ... sound but they need to bury it.
5,Great cd!,I love this album! Korn really came through this time! I suggest anyone who likes Korn to buy the album now!
3,Just doesn't click,"I can't quite put my finger on it, but this album just doesn't click. All of the elements are there to keep die-hard Korn fans interested, but it seems like Unmemorable would've been a better title.A few tracks do stand out, and the album is certainly not bad. However, it sounds over-produced, especially when a chorus rolls around. I don't know. Perhaps Korn has become a victim of their own stylistic creation or perhaps, a dud was inevitable."
4,Worth the year-long wait?,"For me, Follow the leader is Korn's best album, mostly because Head & Munky got so many wicked cool sounds out of their guitar, and because fieldy's signature bass sound was very audible. Those things arent nearly as present on Untouchables. Sure Thoughtless and Hollow life (which has a very Dead bodies every-esque intro) dont follow the normal Korn formula, the rest of the album is non-stop anger, self-hate, or various (negative) emotions. Dont get me wrong, i like the CD, but my heart yearns for some Difference occaisionally.David's drums sound better, not as good as they could but its improving.Untouchables is far superior to Issues. But was it worth the one year wait? Depends on much of a fan you are"
5,straight out opinion,"hello,well i indulged my opinion too say korn is very interesting group the new cd UNTOUCHABLES IS GREAT MAN I THINK IT ROCKS THE ONLY THING WRONG IS NOTHING THE BAND HAS REALLY DONE IT ON CONTRIBUTING THERE TALENT THE BEST THING IS THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT MUSIC USED HOW ODD IT SOUNDS AND HOW JOHN DAVIS HAS USED HIS VOICE ALOT MORE THAN USUAL WELL I HAVE NOT MUCH WORDS TO SAY BUT THAT KORN HAS PLEASED ME BECAUSE I NEW THE CD, ALBUM WAS GOING TO BE A HIT SOMETHING TO LISTEN TO AND CONNECTS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS .ALWAYSSILLY -ANNA NATAL"
5,best korn review ever!,"ijust recently bought the korn cd (the new one) and ijust loved it, i mean if you havent even heard one of the songs on there you dont know what your missing because of course korn is the best band in the world so of course you have heard about them either on mtv or e! or somewhere else any way korn rules buy the cd and i just want to say that korn you guys rock you guys dont know how much of a fan i am of you guys and i know that they/you korn may not be reading this but i will propably do any thing to meet korn for even a second so just buy the cd and listen. the endp.s. KORN RULES THE WORLD OF MUSIC"
3,"A little more Korn, a little less bean...","A slightly different Korn that we've all come a custom to hearing. But in my opinion, it's a better Korn.. Davis has the voice of a one of a kind. Still loaded with anger and yet, he seems just so emotional perhaps... Such as ""Alone I Break"", it's a well crafted song with a chorus that just sticks in your mind.. ""Wake Up Hate"" in another one that just seems to stick to your ribs.. And Yet, there are flaws here too. A few of the tracks seem to be lacking just a touch of something, perhaps they just need a little, spunk?..? Whatever the word may be, mid through the album it just seems to drag along until a couple of good ending tracks.. One thing that has seemed to stick with Korn over the years is their own style of playing music with the same booming sound on very track.."
2,Korn has sold out,"I have been a Korn fan for many years and I was hoping they wouldn't sell out like other bands do when they become succesful. Musically speaking, Korn did a good job with 'Untouchables,' but I think they tried too hard to appeal to the mainstream-pop crowd. When they first came out, Mr. Davis was full of rage and aggression, which is why I liked Korn so much. Now the vocals have a whiny feel to them. Unfortunately, Korn has gone soft."
2,KoRn has Lost Their Touch,"Don't get me wrong, I L.O.V.E. KoRn, and must take a lot for a KoRn fan as deticated as I am to say anything by them [is horrible], but this album [is horrible]! The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one was because of the songs 'Here to Stay' and 'Embrace', the only songs that have something I can bang my head to. The other songs sound all sweet with Jonathan makeing all thses squeeky noises, and with Munky and Head playing one or two strings at a time, and with Feildy gently plucking at his bass, and with David lightly tapping on a tambarine, instead of rocking hard like KoRn is supposed to. I for one wish they had stopped with Follow the Leader, because KoRn has really lost their touch."
5,NICE!,"Jon, Fieldy, Munky, Head, and Dave have sent a strong, clear, message to all the other rock bands out there that to be the best first you have to BEAT the best. The reason they're the best is because they are innovators, they had the grapefruits to try something new. They took hard rock and mixed in a little rap, and got rock-rap. This new genre took its time in making it big but so did every other music innovation. KoRn has spawned such hit bands as Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Orgy, Adema (whose lead vocalist is KoRn frontman Jon Davis's half-brother), Kittie, Staind, Disturbed, Papa Roach, and even Kid Rock. KoRn shows its stuff right off the bat with the lead track HERE TO STAY, and continues on to Thoughtless and Alone I Break. and on through NO ONE'S THERE. This an outstanding album vintage KoRn."
4,review of UNTOUCHABLES,"I have been listenig to korn since their self-titled album ""korn"" was released. I own all their albums, have seen them in concert and have been waiting for UNTOUCHABLES to come out. This album is pretty good considering that is is hard to maintain the same sound and unique style that their past albums have had. I would not say this is my favorite or possibly their best album and i may skip over a couple tracks but overall I enjoy listening to it and It is worth. here to stay is one of the best songs on the CD and the other tracks are pretty good as well. This Cd and your opinion of it really depend on your taste of music and whether or not you prefer the sound of some of their past albums. My suggestion is download or preview some of the songs and then decide whether or not u care to buy it but I do strongly urge you to purchase it because it is a good album and does show Korn has maintained their talent!"
5,Korns Best.....,"This CD is korns best...it mixes metal, rap, ans soft music all together in 1. And it also features a remix version of Here To Stay....this is one of the best rock songs of all time...and is a must have for ne rock fan..."
5,"THEY DID IT AGAIN, AND BETTER!...","This is one of my personal favorite cd's period. The main reason why i love this cd so much is because i can sing along to every song on here. I love Korn and I love to sing which makes this the perfect Korn album for me... (My favorite song to sing along to on this is ""Hallow Life"". that song is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.)..."
2,A very un-Korn Korn album,"Don't get me wrong; I love Korn to death, but the magic isn't there anymore. The fact is that the style of metal that they created has been beaten to death by countless imitators(Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Disturbed, Slipknot and at least 60% of the bands on modern rock radio). I doesn't sound as fresh and as innovative as it once did on their first two albums, Korn and Life Is Peachy. And they even beame revitalized with making their nu-metal more progressive with their best album, Follow The Leader and Issues. But Untouchables and their most recent album Take A Look In The Mirror did something that actually few rock albums actually do; it bored me. I rarely listen to either of them, and I do hope that the band recaptures the creative spark that the had through the 90's. Peace."
2,"another album, another fred, chester, and manson","The pain and misery of ones childhood embraced through spine tingling vocals, and crying guitars, beatiful! the shreiks of a man so deep in the abyss of torture just went bye bye. untouchables is a POP album, im sorry to say it but it is. i no longer listen to these guys very much, unless its the first two albums, and rarly ill pop in the other two, but this! this is a mistake or somthing. what a dissapointment i thought i knew o johnny boy better than that. ah well. Children of Bodom rules the ruins!"
5,korn are...,"back on track - awesome.this album reminds me why i got into korn in the first place - with a spacey, futuristic sound. after the disappointing 'issues' this album is a godsend.. fantastic!"
3,Not bad.,"I guess Korn wanted to experiment and they did a pretty good job, but is not as good as their first four albums."
4,Good rock metal album by a good band who can pull off both sounds,"Korn's Untouchables has been giving mixed reviews over the years. I personally enjoy 11 out of the 15 songs on it, the cd says 14 but their is the bonus remix song of Here to Stay as track 15. They comined a musical sound of both metal and rock music into the same cd. I actually enjoy this new cd of their's because of the lryics in the songs Hollow Life, Thoughtless, Alone I break, and No One's There. I didn't care for track 2 Make Believe, Track 3 Blame, Track 5 Bottled up Inside, and track 10 Embrace. But if your looking for a good mixture of music both lryically and for the music then this rock metal cd will be great for you to enjoy time and time again. Just keep an open mind and ear to the music on this cd and see how many songs you end up liking out of the whole cd."
3,A decent album,I'm a big fan of KoRn. When I first heard Hear to stay I thought that this was their heaviest album. But really it isn't. Their heaviest album I always felt was their self titled album and Take a look in the Mirror. This album does have some heavy tunes. Thoughtless is one of my favorite songs. And beat it up right and wake up hate are pretty heavy tunes too. Not my favorite korn album but however I don't have any regrets buying this album.
1,Worst KoRn album to date!,"I can never say I've been a KoRn fan but I know what heavy metal is,...and sadly this is not it! I think KoRn has been getting softer after every album and more commericial. If you were looking for another KoRn CD like there first one then don't buy it, but if your looking for something like poser wannabee rock (*cough cough* Limp Bizkit) then by all means buy it! I gave it one star cuz of ""Here To Stay"" was pretty much the only ""heavy"" song on the CD or else I would have gave it 0 stars. But if you like new metal & who doesn't go downhill after every album then I suggest Slipknot or Mudvayne."
5,CD HASN'T LEFT MY CAR,"I admit, I'm one of those people who went online and downloaded this cd weeks in advance. However, I am now the proud owner of Untouchables, the latest release from Korn. This by far is the best Album I've listened to in recent history. The only thing is, now I want more. Here to Stay, the first track on the album, is a great song, with a great bassline. If you have tricked out audio in your car, this album is a must have. Blame is one of my favourite songs by Korn ever, and that's backed up by Embrace which was one of the songs they played at the telecast concert in new york. I definitely recommend that anybody with a taste for music or for all-out head banging, buy this album now. The free membership to kornkamp and the bonus track make this one of the best valued cds I've ever bought as well. So, buy Untouchables so Korn can follow up with even more new sounds."
4,Korn rules!!!!,A music fan from USA has no clue what he's talking about. Untouchables is more like Korn's debut album than any other they have released. The only thing that has changed is the production values and post-studio attention that they spend on the songs now. BUY UNTOUCHABLES now if you are a Korn fan. The only thing I would like to hear more of is Jonathan Davis' scat vocal work that was so cool in the first couple of CD's.
1,P.U.,"I remember when Davis was interviewed for this album, Davis said it will be the hardest album yet. Great I said 2 myself,but the problem with this album is that if there wasnt a space between the songs it would be 1 long drawn out song. Korn has had there day I think, now all they seem to be doing is living off the name. This album is very weak in every sence of the way, if you are new 2 korn start with the early stuff first. This album smells of eggfarts, Pull my finger they r done. And 2 eveyone out there stop following the crowd and think 4 yourself, for if this was a new band debuet album nobody in there right mind would buy it, it would be passed by. And that is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, blah blah blah."
4,Album of the year,"The wait is over! Korn have returned and have indeed reclaimed their place as the kings of nu-metal. Their fifth studio album ""Untouchables"" is worth every penny and is the best of korn so far.Untouchables kicks off with the first single here to stay and delivers a great start to a great album. Other standout tracks include: blame, hollow life, thoughtless (the next single), embrace, wake up hate, and beat it upright a song that is ten times more freakier than tourmates (Puddle of Mud)""Control."""
4,untouchables they are,"korn have been around since the early 90's and since then there music has progressed into something very different from there old 'style', this album see's jonathan davis sing, yes sing, about different 'issues' and seems to have moved on from the past a little bit [....] any way, i think this has to be there best work to date, fair enough its not wot the little kids are used to but i assure you, once youve heard it for yourself, u'll be blown away, its all korn but at an all new level.bring it down guys."
3,Untouchables could be more untouchable,"as any other Korn album I could recommend it to any nu metal fan, not only for it's sheer energy and 'positive negativism', any Korn fan should own this album. the only point of criticism i could spill on this album is the fact that i can't imagine that many songs will be brought live, because i don't quite think it's a live album, like issues really was. anyway, as any other cd from the five, THIS ALBUM ROCKS!"
1,The orange kangaroos,I did not receive the orange kangaroo sneakers I ordered. Instead I received a pair of lime green canvas Kangaroo shoes in the box when I opened up my overnight package. I have yet to hear a response about this mix up...
5,Fascinating blend of history and mathematics,"As a high school math teacher, I found Dunham's book perfectfor filling what is sadly lacking in math textbooks--the idea thatreal people have contributed to the progress of mathematics. Dunham makes it clear that mathematics is not simply calculation, but an exciting journey of discovery. I have included the book in my Advanced Mathematics courses for several years now, and my students always name it as one of the best parts of the class. The other day, one of my calc students corrected an underclassman's pronunciation of Euler, commenting, ""he was great enough that we should pronounce his name correctly."" Journey Through Genius is where he encountered Euler's greatness."
5,Amazing book!,"This book is simply wonderful! It's the perfect combination of history, science and mathematics proofs. I would recommend this book to anyone from amateur mathematicians to numerologists to math majors."
4,A nice book,"This is a very nice and elegantly written book. The proofs of the theorems selected as great are presented in simple terms. They require no more then high school mathematics(although some of these proofs are not rigorous, for example on the summation of infinite series). The only problem I can see is with the choice of the theorems (too many from geometry) but of course that is a matter of taste. I would have given the book five stars if there had been a chapter on Godel's theorem in it."
4,"Amazing in so many ways, yet not for everybody.","The content within the book is truly amazing, but only for those who love mathematics. There are a lot of proofs discussed and explained within the book but it does not explain how numbers were even created! If a book was going to give theorems in mathematics they should at least start with how mathematics was born as a subject. Furthermore to a mathematician this book might be a blast to read. But to the layman this book might get a bit tricky as it gets to the end and will lose interest in reading it. This book is definitely for those who love mathematics and are willing to learn the ideas behind each theorem.I suggest those who view this book to have at least completed high school math to read it so you will be able to understand and grasp the beauty of everything inside this book."
3,Make sure you're up on your high school geometry & algebra,"Dunham gives a whirlwind tour of the history of mathematics, stopping along the way to consider 12 great theorems and their proofs. The journey is interesting, but not for everyone. It is not fully accessible unless the reader retains a fairly full working knowledge of high school geometry and algebra (and a bit of calculus). My algebra II skills are apparently a bit rusty (and calculus skills non-existent) and I was adrift through many of the proofs in chapters 6-10, which somewhat hampered my enjoyment of the book. (Regarding the three star rating: it's not you, it's me)"
3,A mostly sub-par selection of theorems,"The historical background is interesting, however, the selection of theorems is not at all comprehensive or useful in my opinion. Most of the book is devoted to very basic theorems in mathematics. It is not until the latter part that you encounter anything worthy of lengthy discussion (personally, I did not want to read a hundred pages about approximations of pi and the area of basic geometric shapes). Bell's bookMen of Mathematics (Touchstone Books)is far more preferable.Despite this, the theorems are, in fact, great. Their creators were 'geniuses' as well."
5,Best Diet Book Book Ever!,This is the best book ever to get you right on track to eating the right way and be balanced. Does not feel like a diet. You dont have to deprive yourself. It was written several years ago but the basics to this book are the best. I went from a size 10 to size 4. I lost 30lbs the healthy way in 4 months. The book also shows how to maintain your weight and keep it off so that your way of eating completely changes. I have adapted this way of eating for over 10 years. I have given books to all my friends who struggle with weight loss.
5,YOU DID IT AGAIN NINTENDO (R)! BY LEGOLAS,"THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, THE ADVENTURES OF LINK, OCERINA OF TIME, MAJORA'S MASK. ALL THOSE GAMES COME WITH THE BONUS DISK, IF YOU MISS THOSE GAMES YOU PLAYED WHEN YOU WERE A KID,OR NEVER PLAYED THEM THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU! WOO-HOO! THIS MAY GET YOU ADDICTED. THERE'S PROBABLY NO OTHER WAY OTHER THAN GETTING A RARE N.E.S TO PLAY THESE CLASSIC GAMES OF THE 80'S ARE YOUR TICKET TO ADVENTURE TO THE PAST WOO-HOO!"
4,NICE!,"GameCube is a must-have console.The best graphics of all the 128bit consoles!The best games of all the other Nintendo consoles!The controller is very confortable, much more than X-Box and PS2(I can tell that becouse I've played on the 3 systems).But BEWARE!If you already have one, and are buying this just for the Zelda games, don't waste your money.Go to the official Nintendo site, register your GameCube and 2 games and you'll got it in 2 weeks!!!For those who does't have a GameCube, I recommend to buy it now!"
1,deception,"The advertised item is not what you get. It says this is the came console and legend of zelda bundle, but all you get is the legend of zelda game bundle. I was very disappointed in this seller."
4,Good Games and A Good Price,this the best bundle you can find for gamecube that is actually affordable. The best part of this is the games. If you dont play your n64 and you like the games this really comes in handy. this beats the xbox bundle too. real cheap too at walmart.com they had them on sale for $79.99.
5,Wow not to be passed,"This game is the epitome of free games along with a console, its Zeldas version of SuperMaRio All stars. Comes with the best game ever- Ocarina of time, and has the very hard to fina nowadays, LEGEND OF ZELDA, also comes with majoras mask and zelda 2, it gives newer gamers like myself a chance to play the first 2 zelda games. As for the gamecube itself- i have never been more happy with any other system, the controller is perfect, after the adjustments, the ""A"" button is giant, but its right in the middle wich is nice cus its the most frequenly used of all of em. The graphics are up there with x-box(wich i have never been a fan of) and th loading times are exellent now is a great time to buys gamecube because they got all the good games coming out like final fantasy and mario kart and metroid prime 2 and the sequel to zelda wind waker, now is the best time to get a cube, and now with the free disk there is no reason not to."
4,Very good.,"Overall not his best work but considering the many years he has been a comedian i say job well done. This is darker more sarcastic humor but it is his evolution as a comic. Some people do not like it , other do. I am neutral on it. I would prefer that he always be himself and write and talk about things that are in his mind. I wouldn't like it if he were more optimistic in his routine for the sake of pleasing more people. He has never sold himself out and i don't think he ever will."
2,Doing old material by Bill Hicks now too ???,"There's no denying Carlin's importance as a comedian or his brilliance as an original voice and thinker. But you wouldn't know it from listening to this CD. George is way past his best with a misanthopic laughter-lite performance you won't want to listen to more than once.But worst of all is hearing him do a piece on how it's always the good people(Jesus, Martin Luther King, JFK, John Lennon) who get assassinated - a complete steal from an identical routine from the early 90's by the late great Bill Hicks, except without a funny pay-off.I can understand an opportunist like Dennis Leary notoriously stealing from Hicks, but the great George Carlin too? What's going on?"
1,Worst Carlin Album,"When I saw this became available, I immediately had to have it to go with the rest of my Carlin CD collection. If this is his last album, it is a sad reminder of what was once a great career. This has to be the most unfunny comedy album ever released. I'm not saying just Carlin, I'm talking about every live standup album ever. I think I smirked at maybe two observations. As a whole, it is like Carlin mailed in this album and figured he has a built in fanbase so it'll sell at least a few copies. I'll recommend one not buy this album and purchase 'A Place for My Stuff' or 'Parental Advisory'. This album will remain in my collection but it will never get any play time."
2,george carlin swimming in stale routine,I feel as if George has become a bitter old man.I haven't heard much cursing since i stumbled into a local dive bar near the fishing piers.I had the priveledge to see him perform too and after awhile it got old.You can be funny and he is but without the profanity.It worked well for Richard Pryor but stuff like pussy farts and necropheliacs and suicides?!?!? Come on now! That is not funny thats just sick.I stopped buying his albums and somehow i don't think he's going to mellow any time soon.Oh well he still packs people in to his shows and as long as he's happy working profanity into everybodys eardrums thats all that counts.As far as I'm concern I'm not subjecting myself to that.....Good Ridence.
2,depressing,"I have all of George's albums, this being the last one I bought. And I'm certain this is the least funny. I went through long stretches without being the slightest amused. In fact, these stretches (mostly in tracks 3-5 and 7, talking about suicide, hopelessness and the awful behavior of the human race) were downright depressing. George normally talks about depressing topics, but on this album there are no funny asides or humorous points of view -- so that all that's left are the depressing facts. Throw in his normal ""glass half-empty"" point of view (which is OK when he's being funny) and you realize he's making these topics more depressing than they really are. Some of the other tracks are enjoyable, like when he talks about ""Dumb Americans"", but overall this album is hard to take."
5,The Owners Of This Country Don't Want You To Buy This!!,"I've been a Carlin fan for decades and recently saw him during hisIt's Bad For Yatour. Never seen a funnier, more true patriotic american than Carlin. As others have said not every track is a master (he goes a bit overboard with the suicide-channel bit), but he does make you think.My personal favorite is his ""attack"" on dumb americans. We don't like to admit it, but we are as long as we continue to follow and praise a system that doesn't care about us...at all!! When you really think about it, you'll (hopefully) realize that Uncle George is right!"
3,Darkly funny but nowhere near as good as he can be,"As much as I admire George Carlin, his more recent stuff has been more hit and miss. This is much better than You Are All Diseased which I found only mildly amusing but not as good as his previous album which I find genuinely funny. In terms of the more recent Carlin (1992 to the present), this is a very middle of the road album that could have been much better if he had gone for more balance.As for the tone, Carlin has always done this type of humor only this time it's even darker than ever, I can imagine this is what Bill Hicks would have come up with if he hadn't died so prematurely. That being said, the good stuff is spaced out more than usual and Carlin seems to be more interested in pushing the envelope than making the audience laugh. He can still be funnier than anyone on the planet (watch The Aristocrats for an example) but here he only succeeds partially."
2,Almost to the point of not even funny..,"man, do i LOVE george carlin. I love his hillarious views on life and the stupidity of humanity i loved all of his work, even in his later years, he became a little darker and more harsh, but it still had that cute comic edge to it. This material is more shock value than funny. You will be saying to yourself ""did he just say that?"" more than you will laugh. When he starts diving into necrophilia and suicide, i think its gone to far."
4,Extra Extra Extraordinary,"Wow! She's done it again...another awsome album. I was a bit worried when I found out Jon Brion wasn't going to be producing this one - but what a relief Mike pulled it off. Who would have thought? My only complaint is Red Red Red...I prefered Jon's version by far. There are vast improvements to Not about Love , Window, and Please Please Please - much more palatable.Favorite tracks:Not about LoveTympsOh WellExtraordinary Machine"
1,Dual Disc CD won't play in many CD players,"How idiotic. So far this CD ONLY plays on my computer. I have 4 other CD players, one of which I bought ONE MONTH ago and the CD will not play. On the back of the CD there is small print saying that ""the audio side does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players"". Maybe Amazon needs to make that very obvious in the writeup on the CD.I pay my money for the music legally and I can't listen to it. I am not likely to pay return shipping on it to Amazon b/c it isn't worth the effort or money. I feel pretty ripped off. Now I'll have to COPY it onto a CD to listen to it."
3,no new direction!!,"I have to say, as a fan of fiona, i was excited as the next fan to learn that she had a new release. I went right to the store and purchased it. Unfortunately, i find this cd to be lacking new direction for fiona. It's the same old thing. The album is ok, there are a few good catchy tunes on here...but no comparison to her previous 2 releases. So my suggestion is buy it if you want her entire collection, but if your looking for something different from fiona, leave it on the shelf."
5,An Extraordinarily Beautiful Reintroduction to Ms. Apple,"In Fiona Apple's six year absence from the music scene, listeners of the female voice have been subjected to every rip off Barbie doll that record companies could churn out. Not one of them performs with the capitivity, the mystery, and the illusivity of Apple. Extraordinary Machine, Apple's latest album, is a testament to the power of angst and heartache without the usual whining.It has a 40s influenced sound style, but it does not belong on a record player. Jazz, cabaret, blues, funk, rock, and soul all permeate the essence of this album. Forget what you thought of ""Tidal"". Forget what you thought about ""When The Pawn..."". Extraordinary Machine is on a whole other level. On this album, the 28 year old Apple is saying to the 19 year old Apple of ""Tidal"" that she is here to stay. She's not going to hide under a rock."
2,Overrated and tedious,"Listen to this album and you may feel trapped somewhere between a drone and a whine. A singer who appears to have a good voice, Ms. Apple wants to project toughness but merely bores by keeping her melodic line tightly bound while she repeats an overly puncutated, superficially perky delivery, number after number. Where is the lyricism? More than most performers, Ms. Apple seems trapped in an unengaging style singing in a petty way about petty stuff. Despite the many glowing reviews on this and other websites, this machine is hardly extraordinary."
2,Hmmmmm,With the exception of Never is a Promise and O Sailor I'm nonplussed. I miss the old piano-driven Fiona of Tidal.
1,What was I thinking?,"This album is a mess!!! It is almost unlistenable from my humble perspective. It simply is not suited to my tastes, but I thought it would an interesting purchase after reading so many glowing reviews.......best of luck."
2,What happened?!,Until this album I don't think Fiona had done a song I didn't love. So I bought 'Extraordinary Machine' without hesitation. Unfortunately I do not like the album at all. Obviously others disagree but I found none of the songs memorable and most have an unfinished feel to them. Many even have hints of previous songs that would normally not be so bad but in this case it simply feels like she is searching for something she knows the current songs lack. If nothing else try and hear as much of the album as you can before paying money for it.
2,disappointing,"I know there was a long wait. And I also went through an eighteen month period of complete devotion to the vocals stylings and dark poetics of Miss Apple- (Tidal, of course) during which I thought the woman could do no wrong. But with the exception of the title track (in which the lyrics speed-dance through in a gorgeous self-affirming ditty of a song), I found this album to be a great disappointment.Gone the delicate gestures of Tidal, Apple stomps words into her songs with clumsy and over the top imagery. Her melodies and voice are still pretty (I do like the sound of Oh, Sailor) but her poetry seems thinner, falser. Broken-hearted, hate-him-so, ""on my knees""- themes she mastered in her previous two albums that lyrically, just don't cut it on this one.A reverting to teen angst that sounds pretty but leaves no mark."
3,"Extraordinary songs, less extraordinary production","I wish I could have rated this CD higher, but Mike Elizondo's production of it reduced the rating to 3 stars: One for Ms. Apple, one for Jon Brion who produced 2 of the songs, and one for Elizondo's version of ""Get Him Back"". Fiona is as articulate and talented as ever, as one would expect. But Elizondo's synthesized rhythm track and muddy mix tends to push Fiona off balance and forces her to adjust to the music. The one exception is ""Get Him Back"" which is most likely the hit that Sony was looking for. The Jon Brion produced tracks, by contrast, are built around the rhythm and meter of the lyrics, which sounds more natural. Fans who have been begging for the release of this CD based on Brion's work will be disappointed with the producer switcheroo and should keep begging for the ""real"" recordings."
5,Real Depth,"This is one amazing artist. If you can listen to this CD and not feel her pouring her soul into every note you must not be concentrating. Many people have compared this to Wilcos ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"", also a personal favorite of mine. I would make that comparison but not for the usual reason of the studio stupidity of not wanting to release what is obviously a masterpiece. This work, like that great work of art, is perhaps not the ""catchiest"" tune on first listen, like many bubble gum pop tunes, but grows deeper and more substantial with repeated listening. She bears her heart in this work and that is rare among today's recording artists. This takes an uncommon strength and fearlessness and when that is combined with Fiona's musical talent you get a CD of extraordinary beauty. Buy it, put on your headphones and concentrate. It's her gift to you if you are open to accepting."
5,Bliss,"After the long wait for this album, there is no disappointment. The title track shows her trademark of blues and big band influences that are synthesized to create something utterly comtemporary. ""Get him back"" is reminiscent of her earlier albums in its tempo and tone, and, indeed, there are many elements of this album that are different by discreet nuances only noticeable after several periods of listening. The song ""red red red"" is, perhaps, one of the most brooding and beautiful songs ever written.This is an artist who will not be fully appreciated in her own time. The layers of meaning are too deep and multifarious. Eventually, if history gives her proper merit, she will be mentioned with the likes of Fitzgerald, Joplin, Holiday, and so forth."
2,Regrettably awful,"Thje most important aspect of her first album is missing here. The chord changes on this album are dreadful. What makes music compelling is the way chords progress, one to the next, in a manner that amazes us and makes us want more. Think of Beethooven's Ninth. Dah-dah-dah-dah.....compelling right? And the difference between that and mediocre music? Not compelling. And that's the problem with this album. Not compelling. Many of the chords progressions are similar to Shadwodancer but where Shadowdancer's changes were delicious andsublime, songs you could listen to again and agian, this one is missing all of that. The changes are dischordant and utterly lacking in that harmonious resolution that makes you want to hum it, sing it and play it over and over. I ended up going from track to track, looking for that one ""hit"" and never found it. I doubt I'll ever listen to it again. So disappointing."
2,Boring album,"Based upon ""critical acclaim"" I checked this out. I gave it a fair shake, and after it was done I ejected the cd from the player and snapped it in two via a trip to the wastebasket where it now lays. The problem? It's just not that good (with the exception of ""O'Sailor"", which is good). Yes, she has an interesting, smoky voice but the material doesn't stand out at all. It's quite dull, despite sincere efforts to come off as unique. This is yet another album that fails to generate any palpable excitement. I ended the cd wondering, ""WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT?"". I was utterly nonplussed. Perhaps she should think about abandoning contemporary music and re-establish herself as a jazz / torch singer, which I think she'd fare much better at."
1,Extra-unordinary Machine,"I hurt's me now to say that I am a Fiona Apple fan because this is her worst CD I ever heard. Tidal and When the Pawn... are great CD's and are hard to beat, including her single ""Across the Universe"", but Extaoridinary Machine just plain SUCKS BALLZ. :("
1,Cheesy noodling in the studio.,"I can't call this music but I guess it is.F. Apple shows ANYBODY with a computer these days can pump out some basic songs, getting them out there is the hard part. F. Apple's fame is the mystery.There are no songs on this album. Just noodlings. Not even clever or original noodlings. This album was released in the 21st century but sounds like half the bad pop you can find in any used CD bin at the local record store. The nineties never died, it appears.An embarrassing reminder of how low music has fallen over the years..."
1,lost her touch long time ago,she was popular in the 90's but I didn't take this mtv-produced music crap seriously at all when criminal was all over the place. And the public has moved on too embracing the likes of norah jones over this carole king wannabe crap
3,it has ups and downs,"I love the music, the melodies, the usage of piano, guitar percussion and such, and her smoky bluesy voice that reminds me of lisa marie presley but some of the songwriting made me think of a teenager throwing a temper tantrum while on pms. She is talented though and for that she gets props"
2,Please Please Please bring back the internet version,"After hearing and enjoying the internet version of the album, I found EVERY song on the CD version disappointing.On the internet version, Please Please Please is by far the best track, with superior orchestration and vocals compared to the CD version, which everyone appropriately described as flat and lacking something.I hope Apple brings back Brion for her next release."
1,Terrible pressing - avoid Plain Records Pressings!,"I am completely disappointed in the quality of this release. This is one of my favorite albums and to hear to treatment this company, Plain Records, has given it is truly upsetting. This company has repressed many great 90's LPs and from what I'm reading on forums [...] they are all terrible in quality."
3,Jon Brion's production is what you need to listen to,"For those of you who haven't heard the 'leaked' version of Extraordinary Machine, find it, and listen. We all know that Fiona herself has said she wasn't completely happy with the production of the material. However, I agree with the first reviewer that something is missing here. Fiona seems restrained. The first time I heard the 'leaked' version I was completely blown away. Brilliant production from Jon Brion. What we all expected Fiona's new album would sound like..Brilliant. So along comes Mike Elizondo in what I believe was an attempt from the record company to make the album more commercially viable. Although, Fiona herself has said this was not the case. Listen to each track side by side Brion vs.Elizondo and you tell me. Don't get me wrong the album is good, but not great. If I were Fiona I'd keep her good friend Jon's number handy for her next album."
1,I hate to say it but...,"...this album kills me! After several heartfelt attempts to like it, I eventually had to retire it to the depths of my CD cabinet. The fact that I truely find it to be impossible to listen to is devasting because I have so enjoyed Fiona for many years. The songs on this album are terribly depressing and musically I just don't find this work to be pretty or inspiring. I'm sorry Fiona, and I will always love you, but this album just didn't cut it for me."
3,Not Quite Extraordinary......,"Let me start by saying that I Looooooove Fiona. Shes Brilliant...usually. Ive never heard the leaked version but I think that it might have been more..Fiona? I mean that to say that this album is an evolution that im not really comfortable with. It definitley wasnt what I expected. I mean, on some songs its like why are you singing off key, or not with the music at all? Maybe because i loved When the Pawn so much im comparing the two. I honestly think that she and Jon Brion are a great team, musically. I would have bought it anyway, just because its Fiona and we LOVE her! JON PLEASE COME BACK FOR THE NEXT ALBUM...PLEASE!Some Favs:O'SailorExtraordinary MachineParting giftTympsRed Red RedWaltz"
4,please welcome fiona back to the airwaves...,"...where she belongs.this was an impulse buy. i heard 'o sailor' on the radio and loved it. i picked this album up on a whim and fell in love. 'tymps' is my favorite, an upbeat, dancy fun number with a cynical edge. 'get him back' is great driving music and the opening track is whimsical and, i dunno... dorky in a good way. the album tends to lag towards the end but it's still brilliant. welcome back, fiona."
5,Apple of my Eye...,"Wow. Fiona Apple continues to mature (musically, at least -- and she hasn't acted out in public recently, so there's hope there as well...), with ""Extraordinary Machine."" The title track (""I'm an extraordinary machine"") reveals an artist with, perhaps, a deficit of humility, but it's hard to argue that she shouldn't be very proud of an effort like this. Stand out tracks like ""Please Please Please,"" ""Get Him Back,"" and ""Not About Love"" continue the trend of excellent songwriting apparent on ""When the Prawns..."" ""Not About Love"" also features a serious work-out on the piano, in addition to the now-expected haunting vocals and biting/clever/colorful lyrics.A really beautiful, powerful record -- highly recommended. Now, let's see if she can get a follow-up out before 2010!"
1,"Great music, bad media","I wish that I could focus this review on a fine artist and the great music she's created, but just now the media of this release overshadows the art. The DVD side of the DualDisc has just ruined my DVR. After playing the DualDisc my Sony DVR will no longer play ordinary DVD's. An EPIC/Sony DualDisc and a Sony DVR. I've contacted Sony support and they refuse to address the problem. Sad."
5,Encroyable,"Dont believe the nay-sayers, I own over 750 cd's and this beauty is in my top 25. Ok when u listen to it first but then that magical thing happens: it gets better with each spin. The depth the depth...Kind regards from the Netherlands"
3,"Not her best, but still great.","I don't know what happened during the record of this, but there's something missing. The thing is that after 'When the Pawn...', that was a masterpiece, I was expecting a great follow up.The album lacks the power of her previous ones. Maybe Jon Brion's absence as the producer, I don't know. The highlights are the more direct songs like 'Window', 'Please Please Please' and 'Get Him Back'.I hope she teams up with Brion again for a return to the glorious times!"
5,I love it.,"Great album.My favorite tracks are 'extraordinary machine,' 'red red red,' and 'not about love.' kind of a dark, sad album, even with some poppy beats and melodies. can get depressing after 3 straight spins. the lyrics are, as always, great. her voice is a pleasure to hear."
3,Love her still but the production is dull,"Great lyrics, great voice as always, but found the leaked Brion-produced songs to have a lot more life, creativity, and passion than the lame Elizondo-conceived (diminished!) versions . I'm happy for Fiona that the album is released and doing well but the duller arrangements and simplistic percussion on the released version leave me wishful for what could have been. Elizondo has made the songs formulaic and AOR-friendly which fits the bottom line but some great art has been lost in the process..."
2,disappointed,"i loooooooooove fiona and have two of her other c.d.'s. this album is not even in the same ballpark though. she sounds like me trying to sing her songs when i was in high school. trust me, it wasn't pretty. do go get ""when the pawn"" and ""tidal"" if you haven't already. i'm still hopeful that she'll come out with another amazing c.d."
3,Could have been better,"I thought this was going to be a better disc. Fiona has a rather flat, but haunting voice. Unfortunately, the music part of her disc wasn't catchier."
2,One Hit Wonder,"Sorry, I know I am going to have everyone give me bad helpful buttons but I really liked her first album much much better. This is a strange overly quirky assortment of bizzare songs with melodies that do not grab me. With the first album there was more hooks and angst. This is some pretty tepid stuff here. I really wanted to like this album and I am still trying, but I leave asking the question: Is Fiona Apple really in essence a One Hit Wonder, besides Criminal what other hits does she have?? This is a cacophony of strangeness. Talent or not I am dissapointed. I also would like to see Fiona use some real instruments like guitars and rock out a little, I know with her voice she is capable. Somebody want to buy a almost new Fiona Apple CD? It is a good thing she has a huge fan base because this is a really really bad entry on her behalf. It is like bad poetry set to really bad music. Just listened to ""When the Pawn"" 100% better, what happened to this miserable offering?"
2,Nearly tuneless,"Very disappointed. There is almost no melody on the entire album. For virtually every song, the musical theme is so constricted that there is virtually no melodic line to speak of. Her vocals and imagery are occasionally beautiful but frequently banal and her delivery lazy with more vibrato than I've ever heard from her. I have to agree with her record company - there is no record here. It's too bad, her previous albums were so good I was expecting more, not less."
1,"a much more tired version then the ""internet release""","It's really problematic listening to this record.I'd really like to own it like the rest of her records, but as most of you already know - there was a pre-released version that leaked to the internet and downloaded by many.Something in this official release sounds somewhat ""tired and tamed"". All the songs are great, except that they are NOT.How to describe it...just download the original release - and feel the difference.. here passion is lost somewhere in the process (when Sony people are standing behind the one way mirror)Sadly, dissappointed."
1,"Fiona Apple is awesome, this album however is awful","Ive just about burned my eardrums out listening to pawn, sleep to dream, etc, the ""early days"" of Fiona apple, some of my favorite music. The angst is present in the new album, but theres no soul and depth in ""Extraordinary Machine"", its flat, unmoving, and a lifeless corpse. Just listening to the songs brings images that shes thinking ""i need some more $$, heres some more music, blah blah, zzzz"", she just sings it like she lost all her soul, and that shes got a gun to her head and someone is forcing her to sing. Just no soul at all in this album, its not in the same ilk as her earlier works. Absolutely love Apples music, to the Xtreme in fact, but this collection is a snoozefest without soul."
1,Broken teeth,"Tidal was a masterpiece; a soulful texture of diminished and augmented chords with clever lyrics and strong, digestible harmonies...this was not."
1,Worst vinyl I've heard,"I bought it thinking, ""How bad can it be?"" There is noticeable distortion on the vocals on several tracks (""O Sailor"" and ""Not About Love"" are the best examples). The mastering is all over the place, and levels noticeably will jump up and down. Overall everything sounds a bit top-end heavy and tinny. There are also waaaaay more pops and clicks for what should be a brand new vinyl. I didn't think a vinyl could sound so bad - looks like I was wrong! I guess anything from Plain Records is definitely still to be avoided."
4,Vinyl version review - buy it on eBay,"Why would someone expect to sell via Amazon at around 400% mark-up? Buy the vinyl version on eBay brand new for about $22 instead of the almost $100 people are asking for here on Amazon.Well, the album is terrific. The leaked version I'm sure has some stronger emotion to it but either way it is a powerful album."
4,Both versions are worth having,"After many listens to both the released and unreleased versions of this album,I am actually changing my original review.I give this released version 4 stars,but I give a combination of the two,5 stars.I was surprised that over the long run,I actually prefer more of the released version.That was not the case initially.Certain tracks on each seemed to drag and not hold up to multiple listenings.Specifically,""Better Version of Me"",""Tymp""(or ""Used to Love Him"") and ""Window"" I prefer on the unreleased version.On the other hand,I much prefer the simplicity of the released version of ""Red Red Red"".The unreleased is a bit heavy handed and convoluted in production.""Not About Love"", I like both versions~even though they are quite different from each other.The addition of ""Parting Gift"" on the released is quite missed on the unreleased.I really enjoy this combination and ,thanks to the internet, we can have the best of both worlds."
2,What a disaster!,"If I had never heard any of these songs before listening to this version of this album, I would have given it 4 stars. Unfortunately for Fiona, I have heard the leaked version she produced with Jon Brion...and they are FAR superior to the majority of this album. God bless her for not destroying the song Extraordinary Machine the way she did Window and Better Version of Me. The new verion of Red Red Red is better than the original, and the song Parting Gift is the best track on the album. All in all, I'm going to listen to my illegal mp3's of the original instead the retail version."
3,Great Music...Bad CD,I have to say this is by far my favorite Fiona CD...BUT I hate this stupid dual disc thing. The more I seem to play the cd the more it starts skipping then if I take it out of the cd player and put it back in later it might not play at all. I just think you are better off getting her cd without the DVD side...and to tell you the truth I haven't even watched the DVD side.
3,"Very good, but not as good as her other albums","Tidal and When The Pawn were works of perfection so it's really hard to compete, however, this is still a very good album. I love every song on Tidal and When The Pawn, but found that I will only listen to 6 of the 12 tracks on Extraordinary Machine.I miss the brooding and angry Fiona. This album is much more upbeat, but that isn't all bad. Most of all, I miss the piano. There isn't nearly enough, and instead, way too much synthesizer and string-plucking.The live DVD performances are great, and Fiona has really polished her range and vocal control."
4,Unique album showing extraordinary talent,"Fiona Apple's 2005 offering Extraordinary Machine remains one of the most challenging and strikingly original pop music albums to emerge in the 2000's. Unpredictable, yet pretty melodies and dangerously intelligent lyrics make the record not the kind you play when you chill, but rather when you want to spend your ""listening energy"" on something potent. Anytime is plays, it assures of the genius lurking within this artist. Music once reminds of a Broadway show, other time sounds like a composition from 300 years ago played by modern instruments. However, the album never leaves much the realm of pop, which makes it rather -- if not completely and for all listeners -- accessible."
3,Apple Sauce,Have not heard much from Ms Apple except for radio play. Ordered three compact disks at once. Have been working my way thru them. Neither good or bad. Interesting production.
4,Great album but...,"Does anyone know where I can find the orginal, Jon Brion-produced version of ""Extraordinary Machine""? I've been hearing so much about it that I wanted to download it just so I can compare the two. Some sources I've seen, such as Rolling Stone and Blender, have claimed that the new one is better, while others, including Pitchfork and a whole slew of hardcore Fiona fans have said that the old one is far superior. So anyway, if anyone has a link to the leaked version, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks."
3,This is why we don't hear much about Fiona Apple,"To keep it short, this was an unusual sounding CD. It has some positives, is original and some good lyrics, but on the whole not a very good collection of songs. My girlfriend couldn't even stand to listen to it all. If you were a big fan of Tidal like me, you'll be disappointed with this CD. If this was 5 stars (as some have indicated) then what the #### is Tidal???"
4,For those who don't like this one...,"I would recommend you buy ""When the Pawn..."" if you don't have it. It's much more traditional in songwriting structure, Jon Brion produced it and played many of the instruments on it and he's quite brilliant, and Fiona's a little angrier which gives the songs a passion that's missing this time around.I like ""Extraordinary Machine"" despite this, because I do love her voice and her lyrics. Currently, O'Sailor is my favorite track. It's the one that dug its way in. If you've given up on the album, I would suggest listening to it in its entirety a few more times. It may surprise you."
5,Video's are AWESOME! Music is FANTASTIC.,The video's on the DVD are awesome! The music is naturally FANTASTIC.
1,worthless talentless garbage,if you're an angry woman between the age of 18 and 30. You'll probably like this mtv trash. enjoy
1,why was this ever released??,"Fiona Apple has no musical Bite whatsoever.She can't sing&the Production is more polished than what is in a Bottle of Pledge. the music is pretty generic.the Lyrics are bland as well.Her Album got held up for quite a few years&I see why,bu I gotta wonder what has she ever done as a Artist to even merit getting signed?? Vocally She is about in the same Boat as Hillary Duff,Lindsey Lohan&Ashley Simpson."
2,Disappointing,"I'm not a huge fan but have really enjoyed some of her prior songs. This album is very disapponting-to me, all of the songs end up sounding similar. There are few hooks, no great musicianship, maybe the lyrics are the attraction, but I don't understand all the great reviews. If you are not a huge fan, I'd think twice before buying."
3,hm....,"This album is alright, but it is a huge dissapointment. Fiona- stop with the cutsey BS and make another album like Tidal please?"
4,miss apple,"id like to first start off by saying that the only reason im giving this album a 4 is beacuse i assume that this version will grow on me. but right now im really giving it a 2. the original version or what some called the""leaked""version is a 20 on a scale ranging from 1-10. and for those who cant hear the difference beteween elizando and brion are pretty much deaf.nevertheless of course the 2 standout tracks are ""extraordinary machine"" and ""waltz"" becuse they are brion's untouched masterpieces but also listen for""oh sailor,tymps,and parting gift"". either version you listen to buy the store copy to help our girl out so she can put more great music out.hopefully w/brion next time!sorry elizondo."
5,Excellent!,"Long awaited new album by Fiona Apple! She's so talented and passionate and her songs flow so beautifully! Definately a good purchase, LISTEN to the samples and enjoy!"
4,Knobs and more knobs...,"Good to a fault... JB's version has more soul, depth and intrigue...Some tracks have improved based on technical merit and cleaner production, but there is no substitute for the ""original"" version.JB version - Imagine Fiona playing in a smoky downtown music hall with a troupe of gift musicians. A musical stomp of styles ranging from baroque to chamber to carnival-twirling numbers. Great richness.This version - Imagine Fiona playing solo or with a few musicians at either a university club or a mid-sized music venue. More polished and shiny. More direct. Better than most, but more average in comparison.Great to have two versions, but for those missing out on the original... seek it...(My four-star rating is based on 3.5 stars for musicianship and lyrics, .5 stars for cleaning up a few of the tracks and stripping the rest)"
4,Flawed Masterpiece,"Like all Fionas albums, Extraordinary Machine has fantastic, creative lyrics backed up with a wonderful voice and perfect instrumentation.So where does it fall short? - the mastering, sadly someone made the decision to have the album mastered by ""Big Bass"" Brian Gardner who is famous in the industry for making 'hot' or overly loud recordings.Perhaps having the volume turned up to 11 works for hip hop albums, but it does Fiona no favours here. Having the volume level almost constant all the way through just makes it tiring to listen to.There are leaked MP3's floating around the net which contain early studio recordings of Extraordinary Machine, although clearly unfinished the leaked tracks sound better simply because you can hear the full dynamic range of the music.While it's far from being the worst victim of the 'loudness war' it could have been so much more."
1,It's all messed up in English...,"I have almost all of the original books in Japanese, and I find this series to be really good, especially the plot and the cases. but now that they translate it to english and change all the names to English, like Richard Moore and Rachel Moore, and try to westernize every detail, it just doesn't feel like the same thing."
5,Fabulous,"What a fabulous book! I just read it with my eight year old and he loved it and so did I. We just got introduced to the Mr. and Miss books by my son's teacher. We read this together and both laughed. Mr. Forgetful forgets everything. He is walking along when a police officer asks Mr. Forgetful to deliver a message to the farmer saying his cow is in the lane. Poor Mr. Forgetful tries so hard to remember. He walks to the farmer's house repeating to himself, ""A cow is in the lane. A cow is in the lane."" By the time poor Mr. Forgetful talks to the farmer, all he can remember is, ""A goose is in the rain."" It's a fun, light hearted book. Read them all. The adults like them too."
1,Dissatified,"I built a set of cabinets for a client to match some preexisting cabinets and bought these magnetic catches because they were similar to the ones in the original cabinets. Big mistake, the magnets are so weak they barely hold the doors closed. Hickory doesn't say in there description of the product what the hold power is in pounds so you don't know how strong they are, in comparison, Amerock tells you what the hold power is in all there catches. I recommend you don't buy this product"
1,terrible Fit,I rated this product one star because there is no lower rating.Very poor fit and does not lay flat on my dash. If you are reading this review I would recomend that you choose another brand. I now have to waste my time sending this back.
4,Looks good but ensure that the equipment you own is covered,"So far, the book looks like a great buy. However, I was sorely disappointed after purchasing it, it did not cover the Nikon N80 body which I had just bought. It covers in great detail the most popular but not all Nikon cameras/flashes. If you are thinking of buying this book, look at the sample pages (index) to ensure that it covers your camera!!!"
5,leinsdorf a great conductor in MOZART,the opinion of someone is completely false.I have just received this sending of 2 CD.This box contains:1 symph. 27 to 312 symph 32 to 35very excelsjupiter 06-CANNES 20/07/2005
2,disappointing,"this was the first karen kingsbury book that i have read. she has been touted by my friends for so long, that my book group chose this for our july selection. the consensus at the meeting was mixed. half loved it, half hated it. i was in the latter group. i felt the characters were underdeveloped and the story too sappy. this will not discourage me from reading any of her other novels, however. others that did not like this book, love her others. if you want a quick read with a sappy romance, choose this."
2,Where is the spirituality?,"I have read so very many of Karen Kingsbury's books and have always been so impressed by the spirituality of the characters but not in this one.The characters in this book never prayed together. Not once. I was so disappointed in the lack of faith and trust in God.Karen has written yet another gut-wrenching, tear-jerker of a story but the spiritual aspect was dismal.I sincerely hope that she quickly abandons this format and returns to her previous way of writing. One that actually contains scripture texts and prayer by the characters instead of angry bitterness and acceptance of circumstances that don't seem to have anything to do with God's grace.Not her best effort."
1,What happened?,"Karen Kingsbury has long been one of my favorite authors, but this book let me down. I found it exceedingly hard to believe that a thirteen year old boy, with absolutely no roughstock experience, climbed onto a bull and rode for eight seconds. I've seen bullriding--more importantly, I've seen bullriders who have never been on bulls before ride for the first time. NONE of them stayed on.And then Ali--a girl with a fatal lung disease that holds her breath for the better part of twenty seconds? Even if her lungs were in top physical condition, it would be difficult at best, considering the fact that unless she's just hanging on and letting the horse do all the work, she's putting her body under stress and wouldn't be able to hold her breath for quite that long.Ali seemed to have faith in God, but I never saw it in Cody. I wanted to like both of them, but I had a really hard time believing them. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but this book fell flat for me."
5,Incredible and touching,I didn't like this book when I first started reading it and it is my first by this author but as I went along the story line and the characters really touched me and it ended up being a great book and truly a blessing.
3,Okay,I love to read stories written by Karen Kingsbury and I did finish this one but it was a sad one.
2,cliched and trite,"ok,so this is a christian book.i found it boring and full of trite phrases.karen kingsbury is a great author for a limited audience."
1,Not good,"This was the first of her books I've read - and it will, without a doubt, be the last.I'm sure the story might be lovely, but I wouldn't know as I quit 25 pages into the book. The writing is awful. There's no beauty to the language, and the reader isn't allowed to draw their own conclusions about any character. Every last little bit of information is spelled out and interpreted for you. I would not recommend."
3,"A heart-warming, inspirational tale","A heart-warming, inspirational tale of two rodeo stars, rugged outdoorsman Cody Gunner, and dainty cowgirl Ali Daniels. Cody has issues with his family and Ali has cystic fibrosis. Despite her illness, she endures the dust, hay, and allergens associated with her sport fully aware that it will shorten her already brief life expectancy. They find comfort in one another's company and ultimately fall in love.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry author of the Set Me Free Series -Possibilities and Resolutions. President of Just My Best Book Publishing Company. www.janetsueterry.com"
3,"A Nice Story, but...","A beautiful story, but I'm disappointed in it. I had come to trust Karen Kingsbury's characters as being of strong Christian convictions, but this book gives me no reason to even believe the characters are Christian at all. It is a beautiful tale of loving and giving, but there is no scripture, no exhibition of faith short of a brief mention of prayer, nothing to draw one closer to God in the writing of the book. I don't believe that every book one reads has to be loaded with Godly talk from start to finish, but when it is being sold as a Christian book by a known Christian writer, I believe a person has a right to expect strong Christian characters in the story and writing that will help strengthen the walk of the Christian reader. Nothing in the book was offensive, but it just didn't have the depth I've come to appreciate in Kingsbury's other works. I wish I'd have read it before buying it."
4,Good...but not one of her best...,"I was very excited to read the next book by this wonderful author. However, I will say I was disappointed. This was a good romance book but was not ""up to par"" with her other books. I haven't gone back through the book page by page but I am almost positive ""God"" was not mentioned anywhere in her book. I also missed Karen's regular scriptures references as some of the other reviewers mentioned. All in all, it was a very easy and enjoyable read. I still needed the tissues at the end but still would have liked to see more of Karen's faith from previous books."
5,"CONFESSION TIME <Sept. 17, 2011>","O.K., so I admit I've never really liked Ms. Kingsbury's books- too ""preachy"" for me. But, WOW!, this one's GREAT!! Yes, I am a Christian, but I leave the preaching to those more qualified. This story was a wonderful joy. I understand there's a sequel: I will certainly read it. There was romance without all the graphic scenes that fill the novels lately. It proves that ""less is more"". Christian fiction CAN be exciting. This truly is a ""DAILY DEAL"". Thanks KINDLE."
1,Don't buy emprex,"Don't buy from emprex, I use their product for 2 days and then it's broken. Try to contact them but never got any return. You're just throwing your money away for this product"
4,Nearly snatches defeat from the jaws of victory.,"I am an avid fan of Billingham and 'Ray's a laugh' really is remarkable. Powerful with a gift for storytelling that reminds me of Nick Waplington (see Living Room & The Wedding), but Billingham here is much more intimate. The courage to put your family on public view, is breathtaking.So Why do Scala try to mess it all up, with really poor layouts. Some really strong images lose their stock as they disappear into the book gutters, and the compositions of many of the pages and their counter pages are just plain wrong.A brilliant book marred by bad design. We are indeed fortunate that the images really are strong enough to breakthrough."
1,Disappointing CD,"I was very disappointed when I received this CD. While the list of titles seems impressive for anyone who loves '70s music, what the listing does NOT say is that these titles are not performed by the original artists. Needless to say, don't waste your money on these imitation versions."
1,Terrible Singing By The Choir And Ray Charles,"1. All their standard songs were changed to what THEY thought the ALL WHITE AUDIENCE would want. If they sang their normal songs, they would have been great- but they had to be RACISTS. To be RACISTS they held their notes until their voices cracked. They sang louder until they were yelling- yelling to be yelling, not praising. For this reason they were lying- pretending to be praising but were realing singing to suit their own racist minds to please the all-white audience.2. Ray Charles kept on forgeting his lines. At one point he was taken off the stage unexpectingly. Ray Charles should have paid everybody in there to have put up with him. He demanded top money when he was good- now he should give back when he is terrible. Fair is Fair."
1,Egregious,This was beyond belief from the forced commercial at the beginning to the lousy production values and poor Ray looks and acts ill.Avoid.
4,Good rockin' with a great campiness...,"If you want hear a predecessor of the great Elvis, here is a really nice place to start. Pretty nice recordings. If you want to have some fun, listen to an evolutionary sequence of Good Rockin' Tonight:Roy Brown and Wynonie Harris (1940 - 1950)Elvis (1958)Montrose (1973)"
2,This is NOT 'the Joshua James' that you are looking for,God bless who ever this rocker is...:) But don't confuse this with Joshua James who's just released From The Top Of Willamette Mountain...Just sayin! :)
1,I would assume give it 0 stars,"This book was written entirely from ignorance. Homeschoolers live very active happy lives and have very functional families. I would hope in the future that this author would do a little research before writing another book. Oh, and by the way my children would like to tell you that their ""ears don't burn"" when asked about homeschooling. The people they have encountered haven't been so narrow minded as the friend in your story was to him when told about his homeschooling.Just remember, there are many people in this world who choose to live the lifestyles they have,they might not be the same as yours but their just as relevant and should be given some respect."
2,new jack factory...,"From the Teddy Riley ""new jack swing"" vault comes this failed attempt. Track 3 ""Want to Be With You"" is the same borrowed track from Deja's ""Made to Be Together"" and more recently Booby Brown and Whitney Houston's ""Something in Common"". They all have something in common in that the track IS THE SAME!"
1,Don't waste yourself!,"Firstly I must state that I have been looking for this album, on and off for the best part of a decade. Teddy named checked Zan, in his version of `New Jack Swing', and seeing that I had most things that Teddy had produced in that time, I wanted this. Finally, Amazon had it, and I copped it. Alas it wasn't worth the wait. There are numerous problems with this CD. Firstly, Zan doesn't have an even half decent voice. Secondly the production seems lazy, and predictable, and hasn't lasted the test of time. I only liked `I wanna be with you'. Brings to mind the female group `Abstrac' and the Good Girls, who looked the part, but couldn't sing. Not for big people"
2,Okay for Basic Curtains,"This book was okay for examples of basic drapes without valances. Emphasis was on hand sewing techniques instead of machine sewing. I can't speak for the reader of this review but I use the machine for practically everything. Also, not much instruction or examples of decorative embellishments which lift a drape from bland to something special. Bottomline: Okay if you wish to make simple drapes (by HAND) without swags, jabots, valances, etc. If you are looking for something more -- purchase another book."
5,design and make curtains and drapes,"This a good beginners book. It gives a lot of good basic instructions. The pictures and directions are clear and easy in understand. And although it does seem to focus a bit on hand sewing instead of the machine, there is no reason why you can't use either one to make your curtains. I especially like the large full color photos of the finished products."
2,please change the title.,"The title is seriously misleading as this book is mainly about Jefferson's relationships with women and his postcript really doesn't make sense. The book is short so there wasn't too much waste of time, but I would have picked other books if I had known. For somebody as brilliant, complex,and erudite as Jefferson, this book did not do justice."
2,"So, so, not a very entertaining read...","Halliday is purely interested in the man's sexual behavior and his romantic exploits. Contrary to some of the quotes about the book, I did not feel like it allowed me to get to know Jefferson better. There is practically no mention of his public life and accomplishments. Halliday expends tremendous energy on criticisizing other historians for their conclusions, which becomes very cumbersome and boring."
4,Surprise twists!,"OOOh, how do I share a review and not spoil anything?From the upstairs ""ghost"" visitor, to flashback memories, to the disturbing and sensual neighbor, you will be on the edge of your seat following the character! Well written, with just the right amount of emotion and ""thoughts"" of the people in the story. I enjoy both viewpoints, and will definitely read other stories by Teresa Hill!Be ready for a surprise that will ""Unbreak Your Heart""...but only after it is broken."
3,So so read,"Nice story but the writing is a tad redundant. Love the characters, and the twists. Theresa hill is an author I will continue to look for."
1,PASS ON THIS ONE,"This is the first Teresa Hill book I've read, and I have to say it will probably be my last. However, from the rest of the reviews, I'm in the minority. I found the language to be stilted and awkward. It's hard to believe that this isn't the first novel TH has written. If that was the case one could almost excuse the sappy story and hope she did better next time around. Not for me. Buy a used one - don't pay full price."
3,"Pretty boy and pretty paint, not much else","Don't hate him because he's beautiful: A willowy blonde-tressed teenaged boy (Leif Garrett) who looks more like a 70s pop-star than a Pony Express Rider teams up with San Domingo, his loyal medicine-hat pinto Indian Pony, and the two embark on mail-delivery adventures in pre-Civil War Wyoming. Based on the novel by Marguerite Henry, but liberties have been taken. Nice enough made-for-TV Disney fare, and certainly a treat for admirers of pinto and Paint horses.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Horse Lover,"Since I love horses, Leif Garrett, AND Marguerite Henry books, this movie is a must for my collection. Though the quality of filming and acting is second rate, I find it enjoyable (keep in mind, it was filmed in 1978). It is also very informative for those looking for movies about the Pony Express."
5,Great movie for the time period it was made,I had seen this movie when it originally came out and hadn't seen it since than. Its a great movie for the time period that it was made. For the horse lovers out there....young or old you will enjoy.
1,"I agree, Print shop is no linux","I have worked with Print Shop for years in Window department of the computing world. It works very well, and I can make many shortcuts from using my Pagemaker. However, I almost bought the Amazon version which states very clearly all the different OSs that work with it. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Lucky I read those reviews, I would have had to send it back and then go through the hassles of not paying the credit card charge.Some people are just not business people. They operate on a crook basis. Thanks.Joseph Martel"
5,Classic computer science book,This is the 1995 reprint of the original 1960s book. It has a new preface by Feigenbaum with help from Feldman that gives the history of the book. This is the first computer book I ever bought (after McCraken's Fortran manual). I gave it away in about 1980 and have regretted ever since not still having it on my bookshelf.
5,A slice of history when baseball was a game,"Not much I can say about this book. It's dated, to be sure. It's a book for elementary school children. It was something I had (and lost) and read as a child. After years of being out of print, I saw it in the used book section of Amazon and took the opportunity to reacquaint myself with a bit of my past.The book very, very briefly covers the careers of the first 5 Hall of Famers, including a story or two with each micro biography. Then there are a few pictures for each player. Finally, there is a statistical chart for each individual, as well. And that's it.I give it a 5 because of the history I share with this book. But it's sorely antiquated. The best I can say is that it represents a better time in the history of baseball."
2,should have been recalled!,"This TV has great sound and a beautiful picture....when it works. The TV will not turn on anymore and it is only 4 years old. I am not the only one with this problem, there are thousands. The TV should have been recalled for quality issues. Dell will not replace past 3 years. The TV originally costed $1,200. Now I am stuck with an expensive paperweight. The quality of the TV is garbage. I will never buy anything from Dell after this terrible experience."
1,"THIS CD IS OBVIOUSLY A ""PIRACY"" VERSION","I have never, ever come across such a horrendous CD with unclear vocals, aqnd instruments. Take ir from me. DO NOT purchase from this seller!!!"
1,Couldn't give 0 stars,"Another demonstration of the right wing's lack of acquaintance with a concept known to the rest of us as ""reality.""Let's put this in terms that arch-conservatives can relate to: in the marketplace of ideas, success in the marketplace equates to quality -- right? So let's look as a market statistic: Amazon sales rank.Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot: 7,360Al Franken Is a Buck-Toothed Moron: 527,850'nuf said."
1,this book is a joke,This book is so pathetic and full of attempts to have wit. It fails horribly. I'm for the right and I think Al Franken needs to keep his thoughts to himself as do all political satirists...it only hinders advance. Don't buy this book its not worth the paper it is typed on.
1,"A lame attempt at humor and wit, nasty and subjective","While Franken's books use facts to illustrate their points, this book relies on the author's constant barrage of insults and subjective attacks. If you want to read a baseless war on the left, this book is for you. If you enjoy comedic writing, satire, or political banter, avoid this at all costs. Don't waste your time. It's a rant from start to finish, and with nothing to even remotely back up the arguments, it's more like a bad mood than a good book."
1,Republican wit at its most searing.,"You think George W. Bush calling himself ""bold and decisive"" is funny? Republicans have always been renowned for their biting satirical skills (think of Gordon Liddy and Put Buchanan), but this is perhaps the finest example of the fact that Republicans can do more than speak at racist, anti-Catholic colleges and triple the national debt in eight years ('81-'89)--they are also sans peer as political satirists. With this book, ""J.P. Mauro"" demonstrates that someone can actually write three hundred pages worth of ""jokes,"" and still fail to include one that is actually funny. No small feat. This book is a truly pathetic attempt to counter Al Franken's brilliant, hilarious ""Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot"" (perhaps the most accurately titled book of the '90s) with some right-wing barbs. I hope everyone in America buys this book. It will prove everything I've been saying for years about Republicans."
1,Foul-mouthed ranting,"Al Franken took the trouble to do a lot of research and carefully blends humor and politics. Joseph Mauro did a quick slam job, full of hate and bitterness. Not worth the trouble of ordering, much less the money."
1,learn a little first,It's probably a good thing that most conservatives don't have a sense of humor. They certainly won't use it reading this book. Go get Al Franken's book to learn something and laugh at the same time.
5,If the shoe fits...,"...then it's not ""name calling"".Thirty years ago, Al Franken was genuinely funny. Sadly, like everyone else who was involved in the original-cast of _Saturday Night Live_ (execpt for Bill Murray), Franken stopped being funny and switched to ""preachy"".I don't know why being liberal and being humorless go together so well, but being humorless and thoughtful don't.Anyway, this book does to Franken what _Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man_ does to Michael Moore. Hoist them on their own petards! Give them tastes of their own medicine! And if they don't like it, let them move to a country where the government shares their political philosophy, like Cuba or North Korea."
1,Not a good representation of conservatism...,"As a conservative, I must say that this book left a bad taste in my mouth. The public's perception of the Republican Party as ""mean spirited"" comes from works precisely as this one, which aim to only attack, and really offer nothing substantive to say. I'm sure I'd agree with many of Mr. Mauro's ideals, but the way they're presented here really turns me off."
1,A Satirical Failure,"I was annoyed and perplexed after reading both Al Franken's book and Mauro's attempt at a counter. As a Republican I was insulted when after reading Mauro's attempt at literature, I found myself asking one question: Since when did liberals get a higher education than a member of the GOP? And why does Mauro choose to advertise this fact to the public? With weak insults to JFK and a basis for wit, Mauro starts up a humorous story line but can't seem to shift out of neutral. A loyalty to the GOP may well be the only reason to even contemplate reading this book, and still, that loyalty must be incredibly strong, like that of a puppy to its master. I was surprised that even I could muster the Republican spirit to agree with even a couple words of Mauro's drivel."
1,Painfully bad,I had to stop reading halfway through because this is so awful and painfully bad. Frankin did a nice job with his book - it had flair and wit - but this is trying so hard to wring any humor out that I finally gave away my copy. Find this in a library or borrow it from a friend.Too bad zero stars is not possible.
2,The Greatest Book Ever,"I believe that the author was trying to write the stupidest book ever, and succeeded grandly. That is why I would recommend this book to everyone"
5,If you only get one Pollard solo album...,"Pollard's solo albums tend to be clearing houses for songs that weren't quite good enough to make the regular GBV records. There are usually a few great tunes, but for the most part they're for the fanatical only. This one is the exception. The songs here are actually better than what ended up on a lot of the latter day Guided By Voices albums and overall it's remarkably consistent. ""Pop Zeus"", ""Tight Globes"", and ""Life is Beautiful"" all rank with the best songs Pollard has ever written. The production is mid-range, not quite as slick as ""Isolation Drills"" but a bit clearer than the tape hiss/four track style of those early GBV albums. If this had been the follow-up to ""Mag Earwhig"" instead of ""Do the Collapse"", the GBV legacy would stand a lot prouder than it does today."
4,gbv fan in illinois,"I have purchased everything that i can put my hands on by gbv, robert pollard and tobin sprout.I received this cd about a week ago, and simply find it amazing. I am convinced that mr. pollard is one of the greatest composers of catchy harmonic choruses & tempo changes on earth. This album, like most of gbv's stuff gets more interesting with each listen. I know you here that in alot of different reviews, but it was deffinetly true for me on this particular album.Please keep it up mr. pollard,your educating many more people now, than you did in your classroom. Thanks"
5,Too Good,"I truly am sick of hearing of ""indie purists"" whining. I dig all phases of GBV but you know what? I would rather this (if forced) than anything in Guided By Voices vast catalog.The guitar solo in Slick as Snails--where the hell did that come from? ""Life Is Beautiful"" is something else... I saw them live the night before this album came out--Bee Thousand? Pah. This album is beyond belief. Gillard (Death of Samantha, Cobra Verde, solo) recorded the basic tracks and Pollard laid some vocals from what I understand. The result? One of the best albums ever made. It is that inspired, that good. Move over, Whos Next, Pet Sounds, Loveless, Nevermind, Daydream Nation....If you are even reading this please do yourself a favor. I have a life to live too besides posting crap on Amazon--I just want to tell you that this album just needs to be heard. No hype, not opinion, just fact."
5,One of My Top 5 Albums of All-Time,"This is seriously one of my top five favorite albums of all time. One of my friends let me borrow the ""cassette"" of this album in the late 90's and I haven't stopped listening to it since. I only think that one track isn't as good as the rest (and I'm not going to say which one). And despite what someone has posted, I think Ahmet's voice is great. His vocal style is quirky and avant-garde, just like this album. This album is very tongue and cheek at times, or its right in your face at other times. I would recommend this album to any Zappa fan, guitar player, or people who like semi-silly tunes that kick-ass. I am very critical of music, so for me 5 stars are given maybe 2-3 times a year."
3,Confessions was much better,"Shampoohorn shows off Dweezil's chops as a guitar player. He certainly is talented in that area. However, the songwriting was not as good on this cd as it was on his earlier release, ""Confessions"". Another flaw I see in this cd is the fact that Dweezil's brother, Ahmet, ""sings"" on it and co-wrote some of the songs. Ahmet's vocal melodies make absolutely no sense; they sound totally amateur-ish. In spite of his brother's ""input"", most of the songs are saved by Dweezil's talent. Dweezil is a very talented musician and a very good songwriter on his own. He needs to keep it that way."
1,Drew's Hawaiian,"Never did recieve cd I ordered. Sent seller 2 different e-mails, never did get a resposne. Will not order from seller again."
5,Laugh out loud funny,I am a native of Kansas and am familiar with the part of Kansas where this story takes place. The book had me laughing all the way and the characters ring true. A real gem.
4,A Delightful Tale of a Fictional Cattle Drive,"Robert Day has written a whimsical story which entertains and informs. Much of the humor, which is in abundance, is tongue-in-cheek. The characterizations are somewhat cartoonish, but fit the story line and make the reader care about events unfolding. Spandler Tukle is a character, the likes of which we have all met at one time or another in our lives. The reader will enjoy the journey through modern day Kansas under some old-time conditions. We know that this cattle drive can't happen with today's city ordinances, laws, speed limits, littering rules etc., but what a pity it can't. How many of you would sign on for this adventure? A majority, I think."
5,A classic but hilarious,This book is true classic. It is a hilarious account of cattle drive across modern day Kansas. The book is written from the perspective of an city boy who has just graduated from college and takes a job teaching at a small town in western Kansas. He takes a job with a local rancher for extra pay and ends up driving cattle across Kansas. Its more than about cattle but a lot about the characters found on the Great Plains. The route will be a familiar one to Kansans but the drive will be one never to forget for anyone else reading the book.
4,WW 1 romance set in Egypt Author makes you imagine the grit of the sand everywhere!,"I found Arabian Winds to be very interesting. I enjoyed getting to know the characters and there are many,and especially enjoyed the author's vivid descriptions of the Arabian desert and what it must have been like dealing with it during that era. There is espionage,and mystery and some romance,but I confess that I am one who detests romances where the hero and heroine are constantly separated so if this story goes there,I will refuse to follow!"
5,AWESOME!!,"I loved it, I loved it, I loved it. This is one of my most absolutely favorite books. Alison is a young woman who gets caught up in murder, espionage, betrayal, faith,romance, and adventure.This is a must read! Not only because of the previously listed attributes, but also, it is a good Christian novel, with nothing dirty and zero profanity.Will Alison and Bret stop the murderer and rescue the important papers? Will Alison lose faith when she is betrayed by one who she thought she could trust?YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK"
5,This book totally rox!,"i borrowed this book from a friend, and once i started it, i couldn't put it down! this book is a definate must-read! it's about a young nurse who gets envolved in espionage, finds true love, and oh my gosh, you have got to read this book! so, what are you waiting for??? you won't be dissapointed"
4,"Quite good, but a bit cold","Actually, I'm a fan of neither singer.I find that Olaf Baer sounds at times like he's whining and Anne Sophie von Otter does a good technical job, but there's a distinct lack of spontaneity that existed in a lot of singers decades ago.The name Irmgard Seefried comes to mind.Sure, I've heard it said that von Otter very precise, but I'd rather more emotions and would even be prepared to hear a few false notes.What's more there is nothing particularly distinctive about her voice.I'll give them 4 stars anyway because there are very few singers that meet my requirements.So this is a box set I dont listen to much (and Wolf is one of my heros)."
2,They Must Have Placed The Wrong Cover on This Book,"On the cover of my book it says ""Her (Iris Murdoch) wise, witty and compulsive novel. I have spent many hours of my life reading a wide variety of ""important"" authors, and finally got around to reading Iris Murdoch. The fact that IM is a philosopher was an added attraction to me.What to say. The only one word description of this novel that comes to my mind is ""pedestrian"". It was an easy read. It had a few interesting people in it, and they had various issues in need of resolution. The story moves along at a good pace, but something is really lacking. I am sorry, but I did not find it ""wise, witty and compulsive"". I found it to be a plain, uninspired narrative.Perhaps I picked the wrong Murdoch book. I'll try another one soon."
4,Murdoch explores the religious life,"I love Murdoch and I love everything she writes. This novel had a particular focus on the religious life-- not faith exactly, but rather religious practice, icons and rituals. My favorite character was the least seen-- the Mother of the convent. She seemed, to me, to be the only character who had faith in addition to all the trappings of religion."
3,1001 reasons,"2 stars actually! This is one selection from the first list of the 1001 books you must read before you die (and now it can be said that I read it). Perhaps, at the time it was written, it was a surprisingly refreshing read, but this literary novel has many flawed characters from Dora, the wife who doesn't know how or want to be a wife, to her husband Paul, an abusive man who loves Dora, to Michael, who has desires of the flesh that don't coincide with his desire to be a man of the cloth. None truly find happiness, but some of them find their lives to be okay. One of the most repeated words in the text: rebarbative (I had to look it up myself)!"
5,It was very impressive,"I read before Her 'severe head' and 'Italian Girl'.Although both were very interesting , my favourite one is the 'Bell'. All characters were very interesting and Michael's passion for men were so real that makes you think a man can really be in love with another man . The idea about the bell was fantastic . I really recommend you to read it ."
5,Great Tool,"My buddy has one of these and I thought it time to get my own. Works great in a drill press for cutting felt dust seals for old tractors. It makes nice gaskets too. They come out looking very professional. Not a tool you use everyday but when you need it, it's nice to have. General's quality is good, stays set to dimensions you want."
5,The White way or the wrong way...,"Paints the White man as a disease , a cancer eating the earth and its inhabitants with a demonic appetite. More corectly, the White race as a virus. A virus performs no other function but to replicate itself endlessly. Whites come in contact with a culture and replicate themselves, forcing the natives to adopt white religeon, white customs,white goverment, white culture, white calendar, and if any refuse...like the indians,aztecs,etc etc etc then they Are SLAUGHTERED. Exellent and important read."
4,Probably As Pertinent As Ever,"I remember this interesting book from the 1970s. It begins with a corporate president interviewing three auditing firm representatives. The president asks, ""How much is two plus two?""#1 replies, ""It's four.""#2 replies, ""It ranges from three to five.""#3 replies, ""What do you want it to be?""Just guess who got the engagement. Given the recent fiasco at Enron, and the stuff that's starting to emerge over Arthur Andersen's ebola-virus-meltdown of an audit at Enron, ""Unaccountable Accounting"" might offer information that is as pertinent as ever in the book-cooking world of big business.P.S. It's a good thing Andersen is a partnership, and not a publicly-held company. That way, there won't be a whole lot of damage to the public when the firm gets sued into oblivion over this Enron mess."
2,32x10 Case,"Case did not have pouches out the outside as shown in pictures... It's still a nice soft case, but not the same as the pictures describe."
5,Very nice,Nice padding and great design. Looks amazing compared to the picture. Shoulder strap hurts the should due to the metal links but i consider the shoulder strap a bonus because some of the other bags do not have should straps and cost more.
5,Good Case,"Like it fits my AK very well. Holds 5 mags. Good . I will buy one in Black when I get an M4 soon. Good Price, Good Product. Basic and Sturdy. I would recommend this for sure to anyone who has an assault rifle. Give it a try."
5,Good Value!,"great value sturdy, heavy duty material plenty of storage (5 mag pouches) plus shoulder strap and carry handle. the only downside to this is they made one flap for all the mag pouches this should have been individual flaps, other that that well worth the 17 dollars fits my AK snuggly"
5,Great case for the money,"The case is very well made and has ample padding. Side pockets are roomy. Has a heavy duty zipper. I use it for a Marlin Model 60 .22 with a 3 X 9 variable scope. The case is big enough for the scope with no problem, but I wish it was a little longer. I got the 40"" case and the gun fits lengthwise but there is not a lot of room. As usual buying from Amazon was a great experience. Great price, nice selections, and speedy delivery."
2,Nice case...does NOT fit AK47 or 30 rd clips,"Not sure what the rest of the people reviewing were thinking when they said this fits an ak47. Mine is squeezed in like a sardine. It does not ""fit"" it bulges out the sides and you have to wedge it in. This would work if you have a folding stock but not a normal butt stock. Oh, and forget about fitting a 30 round clip in the clip holder correctly....it will fit but the flap is too short to cover it and the velcro will not stretch to close it. I would be ok with it if the clip holder was designed better...but all and all for a stock ak47 this will not fit and it will not fit 30 rd clips.....not sure if the longer cases have different clip holders but i doubt it."
5,A Great Value!,I bought this for my Marlin 60 that has a large scope. Fits perfectly and the thick padding protects it very nicely. I was told value equals quality and features divided by the price. I cannot even find another gun case that comes close to the value of this product.
2,"32 "" is not angled",I ordered the 32 inch model and it it not tapeded down on one side. It is just a rectangle shaped case. The case is good but not what is pictured next to it. Also no pockets on the side
4,Hi-point 995,"Fit my new hi-point 995 the 36"" fit perfectly. But just barely. The bigger calibers won't fit. For the price, a great deal."
5,Excellent value,"Great case- tall enough to fit my Ruger 10/22 with pistol grip and 1"" scope mounted. Measured exactly the length specified in the listing and fits perfectly."
4,single rifle case,"I bought this in May of 2011 for an AR with a collapsible stock, knowing I was getting what I paid for. I only used it to take the rifle to and from the range and it has held up better than I expected. I would not expect it to last long if it was being used every day (for instance if a Law Enforcement Officer had to transfer their weapon from their patrol car daily) but I would have purchased a different case if I needed that."
4,"Great price, great product","Being a soft-sided case one must treat it more gingerly than you would a hard case. That being said, I'm really a fan of this - I was able to fit my Ruger 10/22 in it without issue (40"" case length, no optics attached) and I feel the construction and materials are solid. Thick velcro secures the outer pocket closed, meaning even heavy items won't cause it to open out of turn. I'm pleased with the purchase, and for less than 20 dollars you can't beat it!"
5,Great at Twice the Price,I was somewhat hesitant about the quality of this case because of the price but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it. It was far superior than a case I recently purchased that was twice the cost. I highly recommend this case.
5,"VISM by NcStar Gun Case 36"" Digital Camo","The photo doesn't do this case justice. I was a little sceptical at first, but when I received the case I was glad I ordered it. This case is a quality case with a nice amount of padding. I've spent more money for less of case in the past and I will most likely be buying more of these even for my none AR type guns. What you probably don't see is that this case also comes with a quick detach shoulder sling. My AR and 30 rd Pmags fit well and I am very pleased. You can't go wrong here. Buy with confidence."
4,Good bag,I bought this as a gift for my father in law to hold his AK47. I thought it was a great bag for the price. The black border was not on it like the photo shows so it actually looks better than I thought. I'm thinking about getting one for my AR15.
4,Good bag for under $20,I can fit my scoped Mini-30 with no problem. Pretty solid and the inside didn't melt or burn when I put the rifle in it with a hot barrel (the material made me think that was an issue but apparently it wasn't). Looks like I should get many years out of it.
1,Not the same as pictured,I received a case that had one small zippered pocket on the side instead of the five magazine pockets that are pictured. The case would have been great if the magazine pockets were there instead of the zippered one. It fit my SW MP15MOE perfectly.I returned the item since the zippered pocket is useless.
5,"40"" fit an AMD 65 with stock extended.","Fits my AMD 65 with the stock extended. Should fit any ak, sks, ar 15 with this length. Has 5 magazine pouches that will hold 20 round AK magazines just fine, but just barely fits 30 round magazines, the flap won't fold down perfectly over 30's but will still velcro in place just fine to cover and secure the mags. Forget fitting a 40 round mag in there. I've seen this same bag sold at stores and noticed it is just rebranded by different companies and the price increased. Saved 5-10 bucks ordering it here over getting it in a store."
4,Kind of tight.,"My own fault. I purchased this for a 9mm carbine that is 32 inches in length. So there's not a lot of room. This was my first 'case' purchase for my first firearms purchase. I decided to keep it. I just keep a towel over the barrel so the zipper doesn't scratch it. Construction seems solid. There are three large internal pockets, perhaps for very flat cleaning supplies. Not much room for extra magazines. I like the handle (a double handle with a velcro wrap) though the shoulder strap seems awkwardly placed but its just as likely that I am doing it wrong."
5,"36""x13"" Good Fit For My AR-15","I bought the 36""x13"" version for my AR-15 which is currently barebones with just the iron sights. I measured my gun from the butt of the stock to the tip of the barrel and came up with 35"" so I gave this size case a shot and it worked out nicely. I can fit the gun inside the case with a magazine in if need be, and it appears that I can add a scope and fit the gun in the case minus the magazine as well. I purchased the camoflauge version hoping to receive a digital camo version as a previous reviewer said they were and that's what I got. It looks very good, well made, and the seam/handle material is tan in color to match the rest of the case. The seller (WSports) ships via UPS Ground from Southern California."
4,As advertised...no frills gun case,"Basic, good, sturdy, no frills gun case ordered and received super fast! To be used for an airsoft M4 gun. Great deal!"
4,Nice little case!,"I was quite impressed when I received this. It was sturdier than I expected, especially at such a low price. I bought it for my Walther g22 bull-pup, it fits nicely. If it had some outside pockets, I would have given it 5 stars..."
5,Nice Case,I order two of these one for my DPMS AR and the other for my pre ban AK. If my Colt AR would fit I would order another for is but the Colt is a pre ban stock AR. If you need a case and don't have alot of $$ these are great.
2,Cheap,Bought to hold standard ar-15. Bag zipper broke after 3 months. The carry strap also came unsewn. Save your money and buy one that is made withquality.
5,Good!,"As usual, Amazon does it again. This is a nice case, well made, great price and it shipped with no problems. I had needed a case for a larger optic setup and this one did the job for me. Another thumbs up for Amazon and their prices."
4,Good rifle case for the price.,"Ordered this for my Daniel Defense AR15. Got the 40"" one and it fits my AR with an Aimpoint Pro optic mounted on it just fine. Will not fit the AR if you have a 30 round mag and an optic mounted. Did not want a hard case as it takes up to much room in the closet. With this soft case I can even fold it up to put it away. Would have given it 5 stars if it came with some adjustable Velcro straps."
5,great case for AR's and Ak's,The padding is very nice. I was surprised with the quality for the price. Im gonna purchase another one and would recommend it.
4,A good item,It's padded enough for taking my carbine to the range and back and I really like the pockets on the outside. It does what I need.
4,Happy,Good product. Seems fairly well made and is well worth the purchase price. My only complaint(s) are the design itsself. It forces you to carry an AR with optics with the weight bearing on the optic. This should not be a problem with high quality sight or scope but if you have any issues with your optics mount or zero I think it will cause problems. Also it is tight enough on an M4 with stock collapsed that you simply have to place the gun in an exact position to get the zipper closed. Any variation leaves you with stock or muzzle protruding.
5,Amazing Value,"I bought in the 38"" for my Sig 522. The fit is perfect. Plenty of room for my red dot mounted on top. The trim on mine is not black, it is actually green and matches the camo...looks great! The padding is thick, the zipper is heavy duty, and the pockets on the side are handy to transport magazines. A great deal for $18, would cost at least $50 at the local sporting goods store. Such a great deal that my dad bought one for for his mossberg 500 in 42""."
4,Nice Case,"Great case for the price. The pockets were designed for AR-15 mags. My 30-round AK mags fit, but the flap just barely velcro's. It works fine though."
5,Great case for your AR,"I bought the 36"" case for my DPMS AR and it fits perfectly. (With about 2"" to spare). Case is nicely made w/ thick padding and magazine pockets on the side. I got 2 for $30. You will pay between $60-80 in gun stores for these. The quality of this bag is very durable and I love it!"
5,Just Fits,"I have a Combat machines M4 and i decided to use that in this Case, until i get my moist nugget, the M4 fits perfectly, with just an inch or 2 of space between the muzzle and zipper, which is good considering it wont shake around or wobble, its gread and a nice build of material."
2,"I read the reviews, and I bought it. But shouldnt have","I was looking for a reliable case to carry my AR in. After reading reviews after reviews, i concluded this bag was the best bang for the buck. Although, my AR(rock river arms lar-15) fits nicely inside, it seems like the bag was not thick enough. I noticed last week that the butt side of the bag has a large rip on the seam, where the zipper has torn apart from the fabric. I'm not thrilled about it, because now i assume this product was so cheap because it was cheaply made. I'll probably have to end up buying some blackhawk $100 bag now. Hooray"
5,NcStar Tactical gun case,"I am well pleased with the case. It has nice padding and it came in the black color I wanted. It also came with the 5 magazine pouches as shown in the picture. Because of the padding, the length of these cases have got to be two inches longer than the length of the gun you're going to use. Otherwise you won't have any wiggle room and will have trouble closing the zipper. For example, the gun I bought the case for is 36"" in length. So, I ordered a 38"" long case. I found that each magazine pouch will easily accomodate a Mossberg 715T 30rd magazine. These magazines are about 7 1/2"" high and 3"" wide. I'd say you could comfortably fit magines up to 8 1/2"" high and 3 1/2"" wide. Any bigger would be awfully tight. In addition to the carry handle, it also has a removable shoulder sling. It only took 3 days to receive my order."
3,it's ok,"this case is alright, the mag pouches wont really fit my mags the good news is the zippers look strong the case looks well sewn, I wished I would have gotten a little bigger case because the measurements given was not exactly what I received what I got was some what smaller than what was written so it's a real tight fit to fit my tac rifle in....."
4,Good affordable soft case,"I bought this as I wanted something ""cheap"" carry my Ruger 10/22; didn't need a hard case for this gun. I easily fits my 10/22 and has pockets and such for my mags and ammo. Great deal, especially with Amazon's free shipping!"
3,Gun are,"Guncase nicely designed. 36"" case too short for 36"" gun. Wish it had fit a 36"" rifle. I ended up ordering a.42"" case from another dealer, much cheaper"
5,Perfect fit,My husband has a bullpup with all the accessories on it and that was making for a very hard time to find a case that would fit and we don't have to dismantle the gun to put it in the bag. 5 stars for a smooth transaction and super fast shipping. Thank u
4,NcStar Gun Case,"The NcStar Gun Case was received promptly, and is a quality product that should last for years of hard use."
5,"Good quality, good price!",What more can anyone ask?Fits the gun perfectly with scope.Check barrel length before you order to get correct. length.
1,Item Received totally different from item advertised,"I received the case (item # gun-66, 36"") within a week which is pretty good for shipping it to Hawaii. The case is completely different from the item that they advertise. Instead of individual magazine pockets on the exterior there is one zippered pocket. I specifically ordered this case for the individual pockets, not for one pocket that can hold maybe 3-4 mags. Everything that I have ordered from or through Amazon, I have been happy with up to this point. I can't say how good or bad the case is since I just received it but, I'm not happy about the misleading advertising. I hope I'm the only one that got screwed."
5,"Ncstar 38"" case","Very durable and a perfect fit for my AR15, would recommend and the pouches on the side have a really good Velcro system to keep your stuff secure!"
2,"36"" Not as pictured","The 36"" case looks nothing like the one pictured. It's shorter in height, and doesn't include the magazine pouches. This wasn't made for an AR, as pictured, either. I would suggest not buying these if you're looking for a case for your AR15. My basic 16"" barrel basic carry handle AR with no accessories barely fits. My 16"" barrel flat top AR with an Eotech and Magpul stubby VFG won't fit, even with the stock collapsed completely. Lame.I feel a bit cheated here as the picture shows an entirely different bag with an AR15 in it. Thumbs down!"
4,A good case for the price,"The case arrived, after a slight delay in shipping. The case itself was shoe horned into a box so small at first I thought they had shipped the wrong item. But once I got it open it could be unfolded and seen in full view. I took it to the range the next day and it serves it's purpose well. Having 5 or 6 mags stored and ready to go is a bug plus right there on the bags exterior. I'd probably use it again"
4,You Can't Sleep On This One Baby!!!,"If you're a true rap-a-lot fan, you have to have this CD. I'm not from 5th Ward, but I definitely represent these boys. I have all of there CD's and they keep getting better and better. It's like having 3 of the tightest rappers on one CD, bringing different flows, but on the same level. Keep it comin' Boyz."
4,Rustic Charm,"I was surprised these were so difficult to locate locally. There were several on Amazon, but this one was the best choice for us.Unfortunately, it seems to be silver in color under black spray paint."
5,Just Right,"I needed something to hang over my dining table, but I didn't want anything too large or too difficult to assemble. This looks lovely over my 4 person seating table. It arrived in perfect condition and fits all votive tea candles."
4,"Good quality, looks good, but a bit smaller than expected","Would've given 5 stars if I would've had a better expectation of the size. A bit smaller than I think will fit a full size table/area, but great for smaller rooms/tables/areas. Good quality and design, and the glass holders are a good idea for outside (had a traditional candle-holder that drips wax everyone and blows out)."
2,Outdated,"This book is well written, and explains some concepts of ActionScript and OOP that will stand the test of time, but for the most part it is outdated. I should have taken a closer look at the review dates before making this purchase.I browsed through this book for a couple of days wondering why the heck I hadn't read any of this material in my other sources, before finally making a trip to my local bookstore to do a little research. And lo and behold I found my suspicions to be correct. Do not buy this book if you are using Flash 8."
2,"Too Abstract, Too Soon","This book was written from the point of view of an advanced Actionscript coders' list administrator, who does a right lousy job of taking an intermediate AS coder from zero knowledge of OOP to 100% in 20 pages. The writing is too full of weak coding analogies based on irrelevant stories from the author's past; it fails to provide concrete examples that would give form to the abstract principles of Object Oriented Programming. In short, it fails.The book will suit you best if you've trolled the Flashcoders list for the past few years, but for many more of us, the leap from 0-250 mph is far too jarring. As an OOP resource, this book is fine ... but an instructional book it ain't."
5,AS - a great language,"Some other programmers come from C, C++, Java consider ActionScript (AS) like a toy. They must read this few line about OOP with AS and they should change there approach.I know Flash since its version 2 and for the first time i meet a book focus on concept and not just language.If you need to learn OOP thinking, with examples, no doubt this book is for you.Authors explain how to think OOP in the real world."
3,Good but not great,"I read a review (not on Amazon) by a testing agency that said this thermos would keep hot items hot until my kids' lunch times at school, but it hasn't quite lived up to that expectation. My daughter said her mac & cheese was lukewarm but far from hot, and it was only 4 hours after it was made (within the five hour window promised by the product). I'm going to try again, but so far, I'm not wowed."
3,The Word in one word.....,"alright. The only reason I own this CD is because Joan Jett's on the title track ""The Word""."
3,Came apart.,This cane always draws comments when I use it. But it is made in two pieces and the head came off in a few months of regular use. I had to reglue it with a good wood glue. So far so good. Also sanding the ears slightly made for a more comfortable grip.
3,"Classic story and illustrations, awkwardly organized.","There are three stories in this book, the first of which is the Tale of Peter Rabbit. I think that this edition could be better organized, given its intended audience: First of all, you need to be able to read the table of contents to know where one story ends and the next begins. Also, the binding is very tight, making it difficult for the ""baby-preschool"" age group for which it is intended to flip through at the book independently. In my copy, at least, about half the story of Peter Rabbit is included a second time, presumably in error, after the third story. A small child might do better with a smaller, hardbound version."
3,california straight ahead,"mistakenly listed as California straight ahead. Seller identified problem immediately, refunded money and contacted me at once. Great job during an unfortunate error. I appreciatede the quick service and the honesty."
4,Distorted pop,"Catherine Wheel's Adam & Eve is a record at odds with itself. Borrowing heavily from Pink Floyd and early Verve, the album offers many effects that are candy to the ear. Although the album lacks cohesion after Masolituda, and the lyrics are somewhat childish and empty, you'll be blown away by four of the best guitar pop songs crafted in the 1990's. Future Boy is a face first dive into avant-garde power pop. The distortion and break fills are amazing, and you'll never tire of it. Delicious, Phantom of the American Mother [lacking heavily in lyricism] and Masolituda are very much in the same vein, and make for one of the 100 essential rock album's of the 1990's.. A couple steps away from being a classic.. Catherine Wheel will probably never better it."
2,Disappointing,"I still like Catherine Wheel a heck of a lot.I wonder if the new direction of ""Adam"" caused the bands' riff. Seems like they're trying to replicate ""Cats and Dogs"". They would be better off trying to write ""A"" sides again.Here's less melody on melody, more forward vocals (thus more noticable lyrics, cry-boy, slightly sappy), and that formerly trendy ""unplugged"" feel (well sort of).I've listened to this quite a few times waiting for the dawn of understanding some others mention. To no avail. DAMN!Concept album or no, this is not a must buy. I kept waiting for a home-run like ""Idle Life"" or ""The Nude"". Nothing. Not even close.I'm glad ""Wishville"" showed up. There's still hope."
5,Utter and sheer domination,"Without a doubt the best album ever!!!!! I have been following Catherine Wheel for about 5 years now and I continue to be amazed by the work they put out. 'Adam & Eve' absolutely knocked me on my butt when I listened to it for the first time and it continuely gets better every time I listen to it. 'Future Boy,' 'Phantom,' and Ma Solituda' are my personal favorites, but how do you pick a favorite from a masterpiece? If you don't have it, get it immediately. If you haven't seen them in concert, GO!! I pay homage to the best."
3,Emotional vocals and solid music,"Catherine Wheels Latest disk ADAM and EVE is a mix of acoustic and elctric music with a slight resemblence to pink floyd. Songs like Future boy and Delicious showcase the bands strength. The slow build up in the beginnig of future boy that drops off to an acoustic guitar and vocals is wonderful. Of course the stand out tune on the album is the single PHANTOM OFTHE AMERICAN WOMAN, what a good song, the melody the music, the lyrics. Having never heard any of the songs on this album, save PHANTOM, I was not disaapointed it is a good solid listen."
4,New Catherine Wheel Fan,"While I had heard about Catherine Wheel for sometime, I had never purchased any of their cd's. I finally made my first purchase when I picked up ""Adam and Eve.""This record is great from top to bottom. Songs like ""Delicious,"" ""Broken Nose,"" ""Phantom of the American Mother,"" ""Ma Solituda,"" and the rest of the album are great tunes. It is not a hard record, but it is not a soft whimper either. It is a nice combination of songs from the band.While Catherine Wheel will not get the notoriety and press of some other bands of their generation, they prove on this album why they are considered to be one of the more underrated bands of the 90's. Give them a chance. You will not be disappointed."
5,A great collection of B-sides!,"The Hellacopters deliver a great collection of b-sides....this band is criminally underrated. Great power, hooks and riffage. Some cool covers and rare tunes make this one a good listen. Rawk on!"
2,book w/o cover,"book took longer than I thought it would since I had paid for expidetited shipping. But included a holiday so I should have just sent it regular rate. Also, book came with the cover, but the cover was not attatched to the book. Happy Birthday surprise. oh well."
3,Bark if you love me,It was a cute story but predictable. It was the book selected for our book club. I would not have selected it.
5,Bark If You Love Me,"I read John Steinbeck's ""Travels with Charlie"" because I loved Steinbeck, not because I loved French poodles. I read ""Bark If You Love Me"" because a bookseller friend of mine handed a preview copy to me knowing that as a writer I love good writing. This book is good writing, a quick read, filled with insight about life (and dogs), and much cheaper than 45 minutes with my shrink. (It also just reduced my Christmas gift decision-making by about a third.) Get it and chill."
5,I Loved This Book!,"As someone who was thrown into the world of dogs and ""dog people"" after acquiring my first dog 2 years ago, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I could relate to so much of the story, from the author's initial bewilderment and frustrations of new dog ownership to her development of a love and bond with this animal so strong that it indeed becomes a personal life transformation. A humorous, touching story I would recommend to all dog owners!"
5,"Te amo, Libro!","Ms Bernikow writes her true story about rescuing a dog (Libro) in a park in NYC. What makes this such a charming, funny, heartfelt story is that she has never had a dog...not even as a child, and is able to share her experience..this love affair with her beloved dog, in a way that every dog owner will recognize. She is not hesitant to admit mistakes made, and I appreciated her honesty; even though you had to cringe when she got mad at her dog and struck out, she was able to evolve from that, and you knew that Libro had found a good forever home. I loved both the author and her dog, and it was an extremely enjoyable evening spent reading her book."
1,A shallow story that lacked insight,"I love memoirs and I love dog stories, but I found this book to be painfully shallow and whiny and too self-indulgent. A good memoir to me sheds new light on ""the human condition"" but all this sheds light on is the author's endless condition, and I found her hard to care about it. DOn't waste your time on this. Caroline Knapp did this story already, and she did it a thousand times better."
1,This book is a real dog!,"I am a dog lover and usually I find books like these to be entertaining and sentimental. This one has a mock heroic, self-congratulatory air about it. It also makes some nasty, judgmental remarks about people who own dogs in the author's neighborhood, and who in the author's ""mind"" are neurotic and have instilled neurosis in their pets. A thoroughly awful read!"
3,I was enjoying this book until....,"I agree with the other reviewers that the book is a fun, light read - for the most part. I was enjoying the book until she wrote about the dog having chewed up her appointment book and she ""kicked him. hard. in the ribs. he ran for cover under the sink."" I couldn't read anymore. I understand that the book is about how the two of them came to understand, trust and love each other. I just would have preferred NOT having to read about her abusing a dog that was so loving and had, most likely, been previously abused."
2,Animal lovers will cringe,"Having just gotten my first dog at the age of 29, I was really enjoying this book. Until I got to the part where the author's dog eats part of her organizer one day when she is out. The author writes, ""I kicked him, hard."" I was appalled! This woman adopted an ABUSED animal and then beat it the first time it did anything wrong? Anyone who has ever lived with a pet knows that you have to be flexible with regards to housetraining and chewing and all of that, and I just couldn't relate to the author at all after reading that passage. I reluctantly applaud her honesty for sharing that bit of information with her readers, but I frankly wish she'd spared us."
4,"good shirt, just one problem.","When I purchased this shirt I thought it would have thumb holes as was mentioned in the description. It does not. There are holes throughout the entire shirt, which is to be expected, so I've just been using a random hole to put my thumbs into to keep the sleeves down. Without my thumbs keeping the sleeves down, the sleeves sit at about elbows length. Overall it was a good shirt for the buy, however I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known it wasn't coming with thumb holes."
4,"Snags easily, but fits tight","This product has lasted me over a year. It does fit well, though the day I got it, it snagged and now has a hole. The neck was not as pictured, but it still works great!"
3,"Magic bus, whatever it takes","I love this album and have a very scratched up LP - and this was the only CD I could find. It's not great sound, and I'm nota hardcore sound person, but not a softcore one either. It's just barely good-enough, if you want to revisit Magic Bus.Timing and other issues related to this purchase were fine."
2,Do Not Ride This Magic Bus,"It would be generous indeed to describe most early Who albums as uneven. Before TOMMY, The Who really wasn't trying. If you doubt, check out this disturbing little curio. Sure, `Magic Bus' and `Pictures Of Lilly' are pretty damn good, but the rest of the album is basically unlistenable filler. If you are interested in pre-TOMMY Who, stick to comps like excellent MEATY, BEATY BIG AND BOUNCY which collects all the hits without the extraneous nonsense. Especially grating is the shrill, idiotic `Doctor Doctor'."
2,A Chance Missed,"This was an odd choice of tracks when it was released on vinyl in the 1960s. It still is. The sound quality then was poor. It still is. The tracks don't really give a fair impression of how The Who were pushing the boundaries of pop into rock, and r'n'b into power-pop, at this time.Worth getting for the cover - however confusing it might seem. For the casual browser - warning! This is NOT a live album, as it would appear from the title. These are all studio recordings, many of them B-sides to singles issued between 1965-67.For the more devoted collector, worth getting for ""Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde"".For the merely curious - save your money, and buy ""The Who Sell Out"" instead. THAT is utterly wonderful!"
3,Great Record... Awful Sound!!!,"I always loved this album as a kid, but I was totally bummed out when I heard this CD. It has to be one of the worst CD mastering jobs I have EVER heard!!! It's almost unlistenable! What a shame.Despite that... I still give it 3 stars for all the tunes off of it that are unavailable elsewhere. Maybe someday they'll do this one right. I hope so. It's an interesting piece of ""Who History"" that deserves much better IMHO."
2,disappointed,"be forewarned! - this recording is made from a live performance, and it suffers from the usual problems found in recordings made from live performances."
4,A laided back Robin Zander,"I'll I have to tell ya, When I first played this cd, I wanted to toss it out the window. I thought that Robin was going to go alittle heaver and go balls to the wall. Well, I was wrong. So, I let this cd sit for about a year or two before I gave it another try. Well, second time was a charm. I really liked it. The first two songs are great songs. (#1 reactionary girl) and (#2 i've always got you). Then skip to the best song on the cd( #5 time will let you know). A slow song but, a song that should of gotten some air play.(#7 tell it to the world) and the song with the Great Stevie Nicks (#10 secret) are also good.The rest of the cd, you'll have to listen to them and, you'll can rate them when you buy it. If you like Cheap Trick, it's a must have. Peace."
1,They don't make it easy.,"The material is all over the map -- a little grammer, a little vocabulary, proper nouns, country names, numbers -- perfect for a generation with a short attention span. A French Sesame Street for adults. I found the CDs interesting -- often the vocabulary included words that had not been introduced so it made understanding a real challenge. I have trouble enough hearing the French even when I *know* what the words are.I purchased this text because an alternative language school designated it for beginning French. Interestingly, they barely use it, instead coming in every week with copied material from other sources.A note on the book itself. It is made of very slick paper with a lot of pictures and color graphics (see Sesame Street above) so don't get it wet. I spilled a cup of coffee, and all the pages *instantly* glued themselves together. My book is completely ruined. A total (but not a great) loss."
4,Light and Amusing Story,"Set in the 1740's in England, Sir Richard Eden ""Dick"" tells us a story from his point of view of a foppish young man determined to win the hand of Lady Penelope Chester. Sir John Chester ""Jack"", the father of Lady Penelope, gives Mr. Tawnish three tasks he must accomplish in order to prove his manhood and then he will give his permission to court his daughter. He believes Mr. Horatio Tawnish isn't a man because he writes poetry to his daughter.Amusing dialogue and interesting cast. I didn't give it 5 because there isn't much depth to the characters since the story is told by Sir John Chester's dear friend Sir Richard Eden. It's a book one can finish in an hour or two."
4,"Great ""go to book"" to have in the critical care setting.","I love this book. Its a easy read and has lab values and blood gases to lead your critical thinking skills in the right direction. What I also like is that some cases are so difficult that the prognosis is poor even with best efforts. These are real world cases of clinical conditions that I see often. Barbara is a good teacher and if you get a chance to attend one classes...do. My wife and I always discuss the cases to sharpen our skills. This is a later publishing, I still get a lot out of the book."
3,Zabriskie Point - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack(Rhino),"Without a doubt,this is one interesting soundtrack due to the diverse line-up of contributing artists.The best songs would be the three Pink Floyd numbers ""Heart Beat,Pig Meat"",""Come In Number 51"",the somewhat country-like ""Crumbling Land"" and the Grateful Dead's ""Dark Star"".A total of nineteen cuts on this 2-CD expanded reissue of the 1970 film score.'Zabriskie's Point' displays each artist's full-hearted attempt to provide a decent piece for the movie's love scene on the beach.But apparently none of the songs were suitable for the film's director Michelangelo Antonioni.It's been noted from Floyd bassist Roger Waters,""It was a sheer hell,there was no pleasing this man whatsoever"".With this reissue,you get four extra tunes by Jerry Garcia and four extra instrumentals from Floyd as well.I liked ""Love Scene Version 6"" the best.Other performers on the CD include Patti Page,the Youngbloods,and Kaleidoscope."
1,not as advertised,"First off, it has no zipper, second, it doesn't turn off the device automatically, so it just stays on in there until it times out."
3,Hidden Controls: Good vs Bad,"This microwave works well and is easy to keep clean. The aspect we did not consider, and has caused considerable controversy, is the control panel. Typically, one must open the door to program the time; the exception is a one-minute external button that can be repeatedly pressed for additional minutes. Obviously, opening the door and programming the time is easy when placing the food in the microwave; it is inconvenient when adding time. This feature may prevent children from starting it, except the external button, of course."
4,YZ the Wise,"YZ (EP)* When The Road is Covered With SnowInteresting play on words (metaphor based) song where rapper YZ paints a picture of a people's struggle despite the odds. Uses a nice Isaac Hayes sample.* Taggin' It UpReprise of the same song found on the ""Sons of The Father"" release giving homage to the art of grafiti.* Thinkin' of A Master Plan (remix instrumental)Instrumental of the video and 12"" version... why wouldn't they put the actual remix on this album, i do not know.* Crocodile DundeeRemix version of ""Diss Fe Liar"" where YZ settles a score with lead emcee of PRT.* Go YZInterlude cut with crowd cheering on.* Mixel Plic (remix)same song from ""Sons of The Father"" album.Overall this EP release is pretty much a must-have in the YZ collection. Good Beats and Solid Lyrics."
5,Excellent.,"The jacket is excellent. It is warm and extremely comfortable. It is informal enough to wear to any event, yet nice enough to wear to church. I love it."
3,A mixed bag.,"This recording is an ideal introduction to the more ""pastoral"" side of Vaughan Williams. The performances of the 5th Symphony and the Norfolk Rhapsody are serviceable if not remarkable.However, the disc loses appeal for me with the performance of The Lark Ascending. This gorgeous piece loses its beauty when it is rushed through by Sarah Chang. She plays it as though she had to catch the next plane out of town.The Chandos recording with Bryden Thomson (without the Rhapsody) is a far more satisfying album."
3,NOT ONE OF LEMMY[s BEST STUFF.....,"HAMMERED got some good tracks like DOWN THE LINE, BRAVE NEW WORLD and KILL THE WORLD....but among the many many MOTORHEAD albuns, this one is really not one of my favorites....if you like the MOTORHEAD sound, HAMMERED may please you....but it[s not inspired like the previous WE ARE MOTORHEAD and INFERNO.....i think HAMMERED, ROCK N ROLL and MARCH OR DIE are BY FAR the less inspired MOTO albuns, but still got great tunes....instead, through the 2000[s, LEMMY and his mates created masterpieces like INFERNO and MOTORIZER...."
4,Motorhead still got it,"Motorhead, formed by Lemmy back in 1975, have provided us with some excellent albums and some not quite as good. But this one - Hammered - is absolutley one of the better since ""Overnight sensation"" or even ""1916"". One this record Lemmy and Co give us a rather melodic Motorhead, and it shows the band's blues and rock 'n' roll roots (just listen to the riff to ""Mine all mine""). ""Hammered"" includes some tracks that have the potential to be classics as time goes on, such as ""Walk a crooked mile"", "" Brave new world"" and ""Shut your mouth"" to name a few. It's obvious that Motorhead isn't just a tired dinasour who's in it for no other reason than money."
1,Aptly titled...,"Well after all this time I guess Motorhead have earned the right to release a bad album...WHOA is this bad. Every single Motorhead album preceding it is better. When you buy a MOTORHEAD album, you expect A) Power and B) Speed, neither of which you get on HAMMERED. ""Brave New World"" and ""Red Raw"" are the only tracks even close to their prior standards; the other tracks are slow and lifeless. Have fun with it, but you'd be better off buying any other Motorhead album."
3,ABANDONED!,"Jessie is the MOST UNUSUAL DOG Neil has ever met. Left at the kennles late one night by her mysterious owner, she soon proves to be expertly trained and an excellent tracker dog too! Neil suspects Jessie's owner is up to something sinister. Will he ever return for Jessie-or has she realy been abandoned forever?"
5,Krall's Love Scenes,"This is better than what I expected, and I rec'd it very quickly. I am enjoying it a lot. Thank you."
4,Soothing OLD School,"If you love beautifully polished standards, mid 20th century style, you'll love this cd. ""Peel Me a Grape"" is, as always, irresistable."
5,Sexy Sexy Sexy,"I really love this recording by Canada's best jazz export. Sultry voice and excellent diction. I've been waiting for her to do 'Cry Me A River' but haven't found it yet. Maybe she thinks it's been overdone? Also would like to hear her sing 'fever'. Oh well, live and hope."
2,Saloon Singer,Sounds like this Saloon singer had a little too much.Over use of the breathy sound is not very good vocal technique and to me is not sexy. The breathy sound should be used sparingly otherwise it sounds lazy and boozy.
4,"Very Nice, Smooth Small Piece Versions of SomeOld Greats...","..But not really Diana's top effort. I suggest WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES as Diana's supreme achievement so far.That is the one for all prospective Diana fans,mainly since it displays more styles,including such terrifically orchestrated ballads...Even so, LOVE SCENES is definitely a worthy companion. Perhaps WHEN I LOOK is so outstanding that anyone would have a tough time equalling it. Every piece here though is a winner too, even if the sets includes a few more familiar old standards.(WHEN I LOOK has more less known songs.) The rarely done ""Garden in the Rain"" is my favorite here, along with the better known ""How Deep is the Ocean?"", and ""I Don't Stand A Ghost of a Chance"" .By the way,oddly ""All or Nothing at All"" is not played too much either these days,unusual perhaps since it was Sinatra's first big hit way back in 1939,and Diana's wispy, snappy version is fine too."
4,Excellent Recording (SACD),"Very well recorded with amazing musicianship. The instruments are well defined and the SACD multi-channel spatial feel is excellent. The only negative comment is that Diana's vocal has so much reverb in the mix it's to the point of overkill and detracts from the natural beauty of her voice. Now I know what Mr. Costello must hear when she's singing in the shower. Would have loved a drier more intimate up front vocal mix. She certainly has the talent, no need to bury it. Overall though highly recommended and a great listen."
3,Just not very inspiring....or melodic...,"I love to discover new artists and I am trying to appreciate jazz. For me, it seems to still be an acquired taste.There's no doubt that Diana Krall has a rich, low voice, but I wonder if it's being wasted - at least on this CD.I have tried now several times to listen to this album and I find it monotone and lifeless. This is not a commentary on the Diana's potential, but for those of us who like more of a melody, this may not be the album for you.I'll give it a few more listens and leave some more commentary."
3,wrong disc,"Indicated ""DVD-Audio"" on hereBut this disc is DTS-CDDTS-CD is playable all standard CD playerand play back 5.1 surround sound with A/V receiverThat's it , That all , nothing moreDVD-Audio is better than DTS-CD of courseHigh sampling sound and multiple sound options , Lyrics ,add video and moreOnce againThis is DTS-CD"
5,Romance At It's Best,"Diana Krall will be viewed as one of the greats years from now. The rendition of ""peel me a grape"", is lush and sexy. Her style on some of the classics, like How Deep is the Ocean is unique and brings another feeling from the song, than heard by other artists who've recorded it. The songs are romantic, smooth, and mood setting for an evening of cheek to cheek dancing."
3,Lovely songs ... too lovely?,"The title ""Love Scenes"" says it all, this CD is dedicated to love.Diana's performance is once again phenomenal, her voice more sensuous than ever, her piano-playing has clearly matured, and the guest musicians are simply amazing.This said, Diana please, sing more of the Straighten Up, This can't be love or As long as I live of the debut album ""Steppin' out"". ""Love scenes"" is simply too mellow to my taste, making it hard to listen to in one-go..."
5,too awesome !!!!!,"Her choice of song material is wonderful, thanks to her some of the great old forgotten songs are like new again. Her voice is to die for !!! 5 stars plus"
4,smooth Jazz,"This is a great album, filled with smoot relaxing Jazz...you won't be disappointed...enjoy!"
2,I guess I don't get it......,".......but I don't think Diana Krall can hold a candle to many of the other jazz vocalists of yesterday and today. Her voice is great and her stylings are all right, but the song arrangements are mediocre at best and despite the ability of the other musicians on her cd's, her own playing is little more than chords with an occasional 8 bar left hand riff. A jazz pianist she is not. If you want new female vocal jazz, you're better off with Stacy Kent or Weslia Whitfield."
5,Brooklyn Boy Swayed To Jazz,"This is the first Diana Krall CD I purchased. I first heard ""Peel Me A Grape"" on a jazz radio station I came across while channel surfing, right then and there I was hooked. That silky smooth sultry voice, somewhat enchanting is what got me. Aside from ""Peel Me A Grape"" my favorites are ""I Miss You So"" and ""All Or Nothing At All"", whether I'm listening at home or in my car she can always make me feel like she's singing to me. I've always had the habbit of channel surfing while driving, which to some of my riders at times seems very disturbing, but if I wasn't a channel surfer just look what I'd be missing."
5,Sweet seduction,"With a voice as smooth as 25 year old Scotch and a truly unique interpretive style, Diana Krall's Love Scenes is a must have album. True, there are some Jazz Nazi's addicted to a style that has been out of vogue for 50 years that may disagree. However, if your musical taste tends toward the eclectic, and your idea of relaxation involves a fireplace, adult beverages and wonderful music, then this is definitely for you."
3,"ok, 3 and a half","I'm young, so I don't really know Ella from Billie from Nina (sue me). I know listening to Diana and her crew puts me in that groove where you wish you were in some club downtown right in front of her. That said, this isn't my favourite Krall CD - the song selection isn't as strong as ""All for You"" or ""When I look in your eyes"" and it lacks the uptempo numbers that gave ""Only trust your heart"" zing. It still is pretty cool, but there seems to be not enough instrumentation from a very talented ensemble (the guitarist Russell Malone rules) and it's a pity Diana didn't go for more piano either. Ironic though, considering my highlight on this disk is ""My love is"" where Diana sings accompanied solely by Christian McBride's juicy bassline.Go get ""All for you"" to see what people are on about and if you like it, come back here :P"
4,Excellent late night listening,"I enjoy listening to this CD in the late hours when burning the midnight oil. The selection of romantic songs make for a quiet and introspective set compared to the bouncy uptempo songs on All For You. Ms. Krall's voice is in fine form with an understated reading of the lyrics.At first listening (on an erratic portable CD player), I thought the sound level was uneven on this CD, but after careful listening, the recording is excellent, if not exactly the same as All For You."
5,Isn't This Great Jazz!,"Searching the local music stacks recently to explore something new in Jazz, I came across this as one of the featured Bestsellers to listen to on headphones.As others have well documented, hearing just a little of her smooth voice, nice piano, bass and guitar, I was sold.Remain more sold after playing the CD through many times. As the reviewer said, ""if you're looking for the album to play while watching the city lights at 2 a.m., this is it."" Enjoy ""Peel Me a Grape"" and the great guitar/bass solos on ""I Don't Know Enough About You"" ""Lost Mind""This is silky smooth, luxurious jazz, so well done and mixed. Got to try more of her talent."
4,good lotion.,"Great product, but doesn't make you as dark as other lotions I have used- I have a fairly pale complextion so for those of you who tan within being in 5minutes in the sun will probably see different results. But used in a tanning bed or in the real sun you'll def see a difference."
1,Choose something else.......,Won't even try the lotion to see if it works because the smell is extremely unappealing. Don't do it folks!
1,HORRIBLE FOR CHILDREN !,"I purchased this CD set for my 4 year old about 8 months back, and today was the first time i have listened to it with her ! Song # 10 on Disc # 1, is a story about a little girl being murdered by her stepmother by being beheaded with an AXE !who makes this stuff for children is SICK SICK SICK !Do not buy !!!![...]"
5,Simple Shortbreads for the Sophisticated Palate,"Most of the recipes in this book are as easy to make as a packaged cake mix, but the results are far more satisfying. I especially like the Savory Shortbread chapter. At last I have found some interesting hors d'oeuvres (let's face it, we're all tired of crackers and cheese) that can be made ahead of time, don't have to be heated or iced and don't involve messy dips or sauces. They pair wonderfully with a variety of wines. As for the sweet shortbreads, the White Chocolate/Black Raspberry Shortbread is to die for!"
2,Hard to Read Print,"Another example of a trying to make a book aesthetically pleasing at the expense of readability. The ingredients (packed light brown sugar, for example) are printed in black, bold print whereas the actual amount (1/3, or is it 1/2 or 1/4 ? cup) is printed in a very light gray,including then placing such numerals against a decorative side border such as a light green plaid. As the book itself is smaller than your traditional cookbook, choosing to use such light print for critical information is definitely not user friendly. Too bad, as the variety of recipes and over-all instructions are otherwise very good."
4,"""The"" shortbread cookbook","This little gem was a purchase for my husband who received a shortbread mold for Christmas. It has lovely recipes and ideas, and was just the companion for his mold that he needed! His only wish is that it was bigger/longer! It was in excellent shape, although used, and arrived promptly--pluses worth mentioning!"
3,Can't really tell you...,"Sorry folks, got this for my step-mother's Kindle Fire so haven't really got the chance to read the book, so this is not a good review for your selections help, however, it is a classic story I think everyone knows (part of the reason Disney made a movie out of it) so it could be worth your time, espicially sense the download is free, thanks for reading, have a nice day!"
5,Great anime,"Gunslinger Girl is a great anime. I won't explain the story, but I'll tell ya what makes the series so great. The animation in this series is amazing. This is to be expected from a newer anime, but the coloration and backgrounds are very beautifully drawn. Much of the time you would think that you saw the characters superimposed onto a painting in an art gallery or something. The voice acting is also very good. The music in this series is also very beautiful. The relationships built between the characters are very well written and also pretty touching. The morality of saving a child's life but using them for a dark purpose is also explored pretty deeply.All in all I can't think of a single bad thing to say about Gunslinger Girl. I am very glad I tried this one out, and I hope you get the chance to enjoy it too. If you like it the 2nd season, Il Teatrino, is even better in my opinion."
4,"Brilliant Animation, but sad story","A tragic tale of doomed orphens who become assasins. Thankfully, the action scenes are the best I have seen in anime since ""Ghost in the Shell"". I like the Mafia government angle in the storyline.Ghost In The Shell (English Dubbed)"
4,Not for everyone,"I liked this anime but it's not for everyone. Having childs and young teens used as war machine and often only seen as weapons, it's kind of hard. I mean, the girls still act as child when they are not fighting and they seem to suffer to be treated as weapon. It's the kind of anime that will make you think.... If you are looking for something different, something that will make you feel something for the characters, that anime may be for you. Lots of violence, be aware."
4,Not bad for a quiet anime,"I wasn't too sure about this anime at first, but after watching the first few episodes, I ended up liking it. It has a great storyline and the action is decent. The characters are likable and not so annoying like how most females are portrayed in anime. The story sucks you into wanting to watch more and they go into enough detail to let you know what's going on and how each girl ended up the way she did. I also like the idea that ALL the storyline of each character collide with or will eventually collide with each other to become one. I still don't understand why it's just girls (besides the fact that the title is Gunslinger Girl) and not boys as well, but besides that, the anime is well worth watching and owning."
1,Terrible quality,"I waited months for this to be released and was sorely disappointed by the video quality of this blu-ray. Generally love videos on blu-ray. When a blu-ray release is done well, the clarity and video is literally breathtaking. I can only assume that this is a DVD upscale since it is absolutely terrible.Had I known this I would have never bought this blu ray. There is no point in buying this when the DVD release is readily available. You essentially bought a DVD that cant be played on DVD players."
2,"Time to Hang it Up, Guys...","These warriors are in their 40's now and like all great athletes, have lost a step. This would be a pretty good album, IF the entire Manowar catalog previous to this didn't exist. It just doesn't measure up. The fast, heavy tunes are just re-hashes of previous tunes, with the usual paint-by-number lyrics. You could just write a bunch of words on index cards, such as ""death,"" ""blood,"" ""sword,"" ""metal,"" ""wind,"" ""battle,"" ""black,""etc. etc. Pick these cards one-by-one out of a hat and you've basically written a Manowar song.It seems the bands only purpose for existence now is to sell tons of merchandise with the Manowar logo. They're following the KISS marketing plan to a tee!!Manowar should just step aside and let RHAPSODY reign as the new KINGS OF METAL, because Rhapsody just kicks their ass in every single way!"
2,Too little music for such a long wait,"I also have been a Manowar fan since 1982 when Battle Hyms was first released.First of all; I can't beleive it took them over 6 years to release a new studio album!! Second; After 6 years they give us only 48 minutes of music?? Actually it's a lot less than 48 minutes.An Elvis cover tune,and an Italian Opera cover tune?? So, we are actually getting less than 40 minutes of new original material after 6 years? What happened to the old intricate songwriting days of Battle Hyms,Hail To England,Into Glory Ride and Sign of the Hammer? Joey always played some incredible Bass on those albums,like ""Guyana Cult of the Damned"".The writing on this album is so basic and uncreative."
4,The Metal Legends Return,"Good to hear MANOWAR back in action after an agonizing wait. WARRIORS OF THE WORLD is a cool disc with lots of inspiring metal anthems & classy arrangements...in particular, (The Ultimate) Singer Eric Adams really stands out on the operatic ballad NESSUN DORMA...and when you thought the CD was ALL anthems & ballads, the band shreds through a trio of fast, blistering death-metal attacks: HAND OF DOOM, HOUSE OF DEATH and FIGHT UNTIL WE DIE. Manowar prove once again they are the most talented musicians in all of heavy metal. If there's a flaw, it's in Joey DeMaio's rather cliched lyrics--even the most battle-hardened Manowar fan (me) wants to hear something new once in a while besides KILLKILLDIEDIE. This CD blows LOUDER THAN HELL off the map, but falls bit shorter than the heights of TRIUMPH OF STEEL or SIGN OF THE HAMMER. Still a good value though."
3,Manowar's Final Exam,"If you can listen to, like, or think of any possible reason for doing a version of An American Trilogy you have passed Manowar's mighty test of sensibilities.I'm afraid that I must report that I failed this test.Check and mate --- victory goes to Manowar."
5,"Manowar knows how to rock, not how to make solid albums...","After 7 years Manowar finally puts out a new studio album, and it definitely rocks, but you'd think by now that they'd realize that we don't want the one or two stupid songs that they always have to put on their albums. There are a few tracks on this album that you'll probably want to skip, so the album isn't solid, but there's a lot of triumph and promoting of Manowar. Amazingly, the word ""loser"" is not said once on the album as this is one of the most positive albums about victory, honor, pride, thunder, wind, rain, steel, blood, and Manowar. Probably their 2nd best album next to Kings of Metal or Louder than Hell. A must have for any man who loves to hail and kill!"
5,Manowar warriors of the world,"Heavy,beautiful and diverse,sounds like no one but manowar,a mark of true greatness,ultra fast- mid paced -heavy ballads-great vocals -great musicianship,cant say enough,this has put them over the top in europe home of true metal people,if you fit in that category,buy and enjoy."
4,"Not quite as brutal, but still Manowar...","The long awaited Manowar album has finally arrived. ... this is the very album die-hard fans have been salivating over.After releasing two live albums between 96 and now, Warriors of the World is 45 minutes of bone crunching and triumphant symphonies. Many may view this as a toned down effort, with odd tributes (one most notably to a bunch of Elvis fans), the album still comes off as a typical concentrated effort from the Kings of Metal. Eric Adams sounds better than ever, and with such lyrics as ""I'll hunt you down and tear you limb from limb"" one can be sure that Manowar has not lost their edge.There are, however a couple of surprises, like the famous operatic Nessun Dorma, and this is where Eric Adams truly shows his versatility in vocals. 6 year absence, two stellar live albums, and now this, Manowar truly show that they are Warriors of the World, fight for metal, metal that's real."
1,Don't Buy This Album!!,"This is the worst Manowar album ever. If you grew up on them in the early days and liked that sound, this is nothing like it. Check out ""Fighting the World through ""Louder then Hell"" era. That is What Manowar should sound like. I bought it for $1 at a pawn shop and feel like I was ripped off."
5,manowarrior,"this album is intense to say the least, thats all, its unbelievable. metal is god and so is manowar."
4,Manowar for the 21st Century,"This CD has it's excellent points, it's good points, and maybe one bad point. First off, the excellent points. The songs ""Call To Arms,"" ""Warriors Of The World United,"" ""Hand of Doom,"" ""House of Death,"" and ""Fight Until We Die"" are all what fans of the Kings of Metal would expect: Hard, heavy, and brutal! (""House of Death"" has to be one of the most brutal Manowar songs I've heard so far.) ""Swords in the Wind/Valhalla"" are nice ballads done in classic Manowar style. ""Fight For Freedom"" borders on excellence in my opinion, with a positive message that encapsulates the American Spirit. ""Nessun Dorma"" and ""An American Trilogy"" are both very nicely done, once you get past the shock of hearing Eric Adams sing opera and Elvis. ""The March"" is just ""eh;"" It's just an intrumental and a cheesy one at that. But overall, the good far outweighs the bad on this CD in my opinion. Buy it if you're a fan of Manowar and if you're prepared for a couple of surprises."
2,Lack of likeable characters...,"When I first started reading this book, I simply could not get into it. I ploughed through most of ""The Man of Property"" before I finally was able to get into the story, and even then I find myself wondering if I only finished the book because I have never not done so.As for the characters...Soames is nothing short of detestable, and Irene simply got on my nerves. Out of the rest of the characters, the only two who truly stuck out to me were the Old and Young Jolyons, and I am sure I only liked them because they were the least ""Forsyte-ish"" of the whole cast.This novel may have been named one of the great romantic sagas ever, its author may have won the Nobel Prize, but I simply cannot place it up there with works by the likes of Jane Austen and Henry James."
3,A worthy find for the budget minded.,"Zoetrope in their prime featured Barry Stern (R.I.P.) later of Trouble, and Louis Svitek later of M.O.D. and Mindfunk, and played their own style of thrash that they termed ""Street Metal"" (which was supposed to reflect the rough Chicago streets they came from). Their first two albums were thrashing classics, with A Life Of Crime coming close to, if not actually being a milestone of the genre. This is their third and last album and is somewhat of a comeback, having been recorded 6 years after A Life Of Crime and retaining only 1 original memember - guitarist Kevin Michael. While only a shadow of their former greatness, this CD really isn't that bad at all. Something any oldschool thrash fan could appreciate. Most definitely worth the .01c that so many copies are being offered for currently."
1,Wont stay running,"Right out of the box, it wont stay running after it warms up. Looking into sending it back or having it serviced, if it has a warranty. very dissatified."
1,Only lasted two summers,"I will say this trimmer ran great for two summers. It was powerful and easy to handle for this woman in her 40's. This third summer it won't stay running. I read another review with the same problem. Good trimmer for 2 summers, moderate use, maybe 6 times all summer. Maintained, stored in a dry place. Third summer it starts but won't stay running. My mechanic friend said all the filters are clean, good fuel, but its only getting the fuel you pre-pump to start it. It would cost about the same to fix what is probably a carburetor problem as buy a new one. Not worth it. And after reading other similar reviews I'm going with something else."
5,I LOVE IT!,"After two weeks of reading reviews, talking to friends, checking consumer reports, and comparing many different units, I finally decided on the Troy-bilt TB20CS. I bought it from Lowes for $98.99. When I got home, I put it together. Took about 10 minutes. I put gas into it and read the fairly easy starting instructions. It started right up. I took it behind the fence in my back yard and started chopping away. It works like a dream. Ten times better on the 3 foot high weeds, than my old electric trimmer. It's a little heavier than my electric, but not too bad. Great power, good balance. It's so well balanced, that sometimes I let go with my left hand and just held it with one hand. I told my wife I should have bought one of these ten years ago. All I can say is ""I love it!"""
4,Troy-Bilt Trimmer,Due to the weight of the trimmer you will need to add a sling. That is why I will only give this item four stars. The line is used up very fast which requires constant loading of the spool. The trimmer is easy to start.
1,hard to start,"Add my review (to the many others) stating the hard-to-start characteristic of the Troy Bilt curved shaft weedeater. It has been hard to start (dozens of pulls while fiddling with the choke lever etc according to the manual instructions). Always used ""fresh gas"". The first time I used it, and every other time I tried to use it, it has been hard to start. Avoid this piece of junk."
1,Troy Bilt Sucks,Don't buy Troy Bilt. Parts are missing from the box and when you try to ask for it they outsource their parts replacement and that place gives you the run around. Better off with another brand. Don't ever buy troy bilt.
1,Problems with fuel line,"We have had the Troy Bilt TB20CS for about a yr and a half. Up until recently it worked well - started easily, was easy to maintain, light, and easy to use. Recently though, the fuel line and filter that reside in the gas tank, disintegrated. I have taken it apart and now will see how costly the parts are, and how difficult they will be to install. I am not satisfied because I bought Troy Bilt thinking this product would last a long time with minimal repairs. Dependent on the cost of the repairs, I may just chuck this weed eater and get a husqvarna or other quality brand. Substandard parts do not result in brand loyalty. Buy another brand."
2,String Trimmer,Don't buy this trimmer unless you like to continuously work on getting the string to feed through the head. The part on the trimmer where the edger attachment is supposed to connect to broke off about 30 minutes after I got it out of the box. I did not get rough with it; this is a flimsy product and I regret buying it!
4,Troy Bilt,Easy to assemble. Great for trimming along fences. Not as great for edging without an optional attachment. Good value for the price.
1,garbage!!!!,"do not buy!!! do not by!!! piece of crap!!! wont run, wont bump feed, when it runs line breaks and must manually respool... do not buy!!1"
1,Troy Bilt TB20CS will not idle. I year old trimmer,"I have a Troy Bilt TB20CS, well kept and maintained and use fresh gas always. Had it now for about a year and use it at least two or three times a month. I went to use it recently and now it is not idling after it is warm for about 3 minutes. I cleaned the air filter, replaced the spark plug and cleaned out the carb and exhaust. It still will not idle. All the comments on the internet lead to replacing the carb, no real good detail how to adjust. I will just scrap it and pay double to have something that is going to last more than year!!!"
4,Trimmer,"Had one of these previously. Lasted about 7 years. Carb went bad and was cheaper to buy new. New product seems 'cheaper', but so far, works fine. For the money, and the functionality, especially the ability to swivel the head and add other products, this is a great product - as long as it lasts."
1,Piece of Garbage,"Do not buy anything manufactured by Troy-Bilt.The warrany on any product they produce is worthless. The clutch went out on my troy-bilt string trimmer with less than 4 hours of use, and their service center wouldn't even look at it because they claimed they were too busy. My advise is to spend a couple bucks more and buy a decent brand."
1,TB20CS TRIMMER- JUNK,"I bought the TB20CS trimmer directly from Troybilt because none of the local stores had it. This trimmer was hard to start from the beginning. Well its been a little over a year It still starts Hard & now the pull string has broke. troybilt has a 2 year warranty, which does not cover broken pull ropes or carb adjustments, wow what a warranty. I have used this trimmer aprox. 8- 10 times.I do not recommend anyone buying this model."
3,Not bad for the price,"This unit started right up out of the box. It takes a long time to warm up. You have to let it run about five minutes before you can give it full throttle. Overall, the timmer runs pretty well once it's warmed up. Tall grass will easily become entangled around the head of the trimmer. The guard offers no protection so you will be covered with debris after you use this trimmer. Be sure to use good eye protection."
1,Trouble awaits,Once you have it for about 6 months it becomes the hardest starting machine I ever owned.
3,"18 months, now dying",worked as a charm for about 18 months. now chockes with open throtle. newsgroups suggest to rebuild carb or replace gaskets.
1,Buy anything else!!!,"Have had the trimmer for a couple of years now and have hated it since day one! Dumb on my part, should have returned it, but thought it was just me having a bad day when I couldn't get it to start, thought it will start easier next time..not. This thing is so hard to start and once you get it running it stalls every 10 seconds, again thought it has to just be me .. nope was recently telling a friend how much I hate my weed whacker and he chimes in how he hates his as well and has the same problems, go figure he has the same POS . Lucky for me it just died and I got a new one -different brand- and this is when i realized what a hunk of junk the troy bilt was. The new one starts right up, idles perfectly and is so much quieter..just runs so much smoother. The new one I got is a Toro, I've only used it once so far but already love it compared to the troy bilt."
3,OK -- with caution,Had for two years now with mixed feelings:Pros:- Price is right- More than adequate for any light to moderate cutting- Easy starting- Relatively lightCons- String feed reel tends to tangle more than I like. Not a major issue but annoying- Easy start feature nonfunctioning at two years- Wacker stopped running at two years for unknown reason. Unfortunately cost to just walk though the door of local small engine shop makes it unattractive to repair this inexpensive unit unless you plan to do it yourself. Basically a disposable machine at this price.Still considering options. May elect to buy another TB20CS -- however would do so only on expectation that it would be a two year throw-away machine.
1,Sorry Product,"I had a Troy Bilt tiller for many years without any problems so I figured they had to build a decent string trimmer. I was wrong. I had this trimmer for two years and last week the motor just seized up. I have no idea why. It has a significant design flaw. The pull string should be elsewhere on the trimmer. It is situated right next to the motor. When starting, if you pull too closely to the motor the plastic housing will shred your knuckles. I cannot tell you how many times I have torn the skin on my knuckles starting this thing. I finally resorted to wearing gloves every time I used it. Also, after a season, it was extremely hard to start- and I service my stuff. In addition when it got hot it would run smoothly for ten minutes then shut off and it was nearly impossible to start again. No way, I would recommend this string trimmer."
3,L'Eclisse (1962) - Michelangelo Antonioni,"L'Eclisse is the thrid film in Antonioni's trilogy of isolation, and never has he made the audience feel so, well, isolated. There isn't really much plot, which is typical of an Antonioni film, and it's often why they're so appealing. However, in this film the silence becomes more self indulgent then meaningful, and the meandering style becomes tiresome. Antonioni balances both the quiet times and loud times of city life, while attempting to find love in between, but it just doesn't work well. The film is irregular, and the performances by Vitti and Delon (both great actors) feel stilted. The film has nice photography and has a very modern feel to it and Antonini's films are always interesting. L'Eclisse is not Antonioni's most ambitious film, but it is easily his most pretentious."
3,"ANTONIONI'S ""MODERN MALAISE"" STILL DISORIENTING","Michelangelo Antonioni's 1962 ""L'ECLISSE"" (Criterion) is the last film of his unofficial trilogy of ""modern malaise."" Set in Rome, the story of a young woman (Monica Vitti) moving out of an old and into a new relationship with a driven young stockbroker (Alain Delon) features Antonioni's trademark compositions and issues of alienation and disorientation. The pristine transfer looks like it just came from the lab. There's an incredibly esoteric commentary from film scholar Richart Pena and the second disc includes ""Michelangelo Antonioni: The Eye that Changed Cinema,"" an Italian-made documentary. Plus a 32 page booklet with essays by critics and Antonioni himself."
2,All terribly arty,"I suppose I should have realised that if I hated ""L'Avventura"", I would probably hate this, too. Just wish I'd thought of that before buying it. Ponderous, slow, self-consciously arty. A milestone in cinematic history, and all that, but terribly off putting and, in some instances, terribly obvious in its ennui. There will be much eye-rolling on your part. You probably only need to see this if its part of a film studies course. Really.Good package by Criterion, though."
2,l'eclisse,"Ok, so it's boring as hell, pointless, with no plot and about characters who are not even remotely interesting. Then how come this film is actually good? Because you feel obliged to think so. Antonioni is a big name, you know."
4,Excellent Gift item,"I bought this gift for my dad...he is very difficult to buy for, and this kit was a big hit...he loved the treasure hunting aspect of it!"
4,Good gift,"I gave one set of these to a coin collector and another to an ancient history lover. They were both delighted. I think this item is meant more for young people than adults, but my two recipients got a big kick out of them."
2,Coins much much smaller than they used to be,I had purchased this same set from UC Berkeley's Lawrence Science Museum only about six years ago and still have those coins in olive oil. I compared this set with that one and these are almost half the size and almost everyone of them are half the size! While it's still fun to clean them and discover what I have I wouldn't buy these from Amazon again since they are so mall and frankly most of them won't yield anything identifiable in the end which is the whole point of the process. Very disappointed.
5,Excellent Thai Massage Instructional,This video is a must have for people that are or interested in practicing Thai massage. The video demonstrates every technique perfectly. The video quality is professionally done and is so clear that every little detail is shown. It is definitely one of the best massage instructional available.
3,"Great price, lots of spaghetti","I bought this DVD as my first ""home theater"". I think it is a great entry level system. Those who wrote that it is easy to install, however, were perhaps being a touch rosy in their statements. The instructions are multiple and it takes a while (at least it took me a while!) to figure out which set to follow. Still, that is a minor gripe. More problematic are the miles of wire to cram behind your TV and to trail across your room if you want the surround sound. My wife complained at the mess...Only about one half to two-thirds of my CD's will play and, easily the most irritating problem, the sound on my DVD's sometimes goes off and it takes a lot of messing around (skipping forwards and back, switching on and off) to get it back. This is a decent system for the price but it is not problem free."
4,Movie Theater Move Over,"Unbelivable sounds,feels like your in a movie theater,great base,surround sound gets you right into the movie,easy hook up.ONLY down side for me was that I have A 1996 TV w/o jacks Had to buy A R/F box (...). Over all Great system 4****"
4,good book,"Hi, I'm not an expert on book reviews but a friend reccommanded this book to me and I just loved it. I don't care for paperbacks so that is the reason I only gave it 4 stars. I simply love the cover and title very appealing. The story was very well written, I was never bored. I give three cheers to Ms. Anderson and I hope to hear from her more."
5,BEST OF RAGOSSNIG AND FEYBLI,"Just a short note here - This disc is an unbelievable bargain because it has the best of the Ragossnig & Feybli Spanish guitar favorites. Can't figure out why is it going so cheaply in ANY condition, but it is not to be missed if you are looking for these two artists. We are pleased that other reviewers feel the same about this recording. You won't regret adding this one to your classical guitar collection!"
3,Surprisingly Good!!,"I first listened to this CD at Tower Records expecting very little. But then I heard Track #2 Peace God and it slammed me. Then I skimmed through the rest and was surprised on how tight it was. The only drawbacks to me are his attempts at reggae jams (which take up half the album), and I noticed that sometimes he sounds like Cannibus now.... I didnt hear The Carnival or The Ecleftic but on the Score he didnt sound like that.... I know he produced Canibus's first album that bombed... Then they had disagreements.... Hmmmmm Still tho check it out. Its pretty tight. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.Peace"
4,Still Making 'Em Hot,"Wyclef Jean's album Masquerade is yet another example of his eclecticism. The album is packed with 22 songs that exemplify Clef's ingenuity in mixing sounds. He fuses different cultures, languages and beats to create a sound that is like no other. He blends Kompa, a Haitian music genre, hip hop, Creole, and English to form an album that pleases all. And in the midst of all the innovative and creative beats, his lyrics have substance-songs that have messages, morals and challenge the mind. This album is innovative and entertaining..."
4,CLEF HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!,"Wyclef Jean's third album Masquerade combines the best of both his worlds. He takes hip hop and adds his own native twist, kompa. Kompa is a music genre in Haiti. Being born in Haiti and raised in America has allowed Wyclef to be exposed to two different styles of music. And he sought to use that to his advantage-mixing what he knew with what he learned, he came up with an original sound. His songs are widely ranged in sound and substance. The song Daddy is about the passing of his father and how he was affected, while the song Two Wrongs featuring City High's Claudette Ortiz is about a couple that made it through problematic situations. Wyclef's 22 tracks visit several different situations and walks of life, underlying the central theme that life is a masquerade..."
4,"GOOD,SOLID ALBUM","Wyclef is back with a really good,meaningful album. He sings with an excellent flow in most songs. And some tracks,such as ""Pussycat"",put you in a really good mood after listening to them. They are really positive up-beat songs that just make ya feel good. But there are also some more serious tracks,like ""Daddy"" and ""Knockin on Heavens Door"",in which he pays tribute to a lot of people who have died. Wyclef Jean is a very creative artist and i look forward to hearing all of his future work."
5,His best album next to The Ecleftic,"Standout tracks: PJs, 80 BARS(80 scars), MASQUERADE, YOU SAY KEEP IT GANGSTA, PARTY LIKE I PARTY, PUSSYCAT(Hilarious how he got away with that), THUG LIKE ME, THE MIX SHOW, PEACE GOD, MVP KOMPA, GHETTO RACINE and AFRICA. Note: the last song was a circuit city exclusive on my copy. Filler: Oh What A Night is so corny its painful but thats it. Bottom Line: Wyclef kept the good album streak going with Masquerade his most consistent work. Upon hearing this album I found out two things: Wyclef is an underrated emcee and an even more underrated producer. The production on his album was solid(minus Oh what a night)and he bought his A game on this album. I strongly recommend this one for Wyclef fans."
2,"Not The Shining, but not bad!","This movie was actually a lot of fun, if poorly acted at times. If you're looking for something in the slasher genre, you could do a lot worse than this one. Great for killing a couple of hours on a lazy afternoon - especially if you have bills to pay or laundry to fold. It's a perfect brain-candy accompaniment to that kind of a day."
4,good movie,"i ordered this movie after seeing the beginning of it on tv, i wanted to see how it ended. it wasnt the greatest movie ive ever seen, but i do like it a lot. lots of silly teenagers doing dumb things, with a few good twists. all in all, i think its worth watching."
1,Who the hell actually liked this?,"Let's be clear about those rave reviews for this: either they're plant reviews or are by ten year olds. This is garbage, pure and simple. I love horror but ""Dead Tone"" is insulting. Someone took ""Scream"" and decided it would be much better if they took out all the humor and played it straight. There's not much actual gore in any sort of interesting or convincing way so you don't have that. There's no nudity so you don't have that. Not a single scene played for laughs but not a real scare either. What is it those people liked about it? Oh, yeah, they liked that someone paid them to give this a good review. Hell, the DVD isn't even anamorphic...in this day and age. A new dvd. WTF? And Flavor Flav's introduction? He shows up and says, ""I'm the Timekeeper"" and walks off. Literally, that's it. There's nothing about this that makes it worth any one's time."
4,Was skeptical,"I think I got it a size too big. Im a size 22 in dresses and and 43 in waist, I got a size 6x. I think next time I'll get a 5x. Great craftmanship and very comfortable to wear and very easy to put on!"
2,Waist Cincher,This waist cincher did nothing for me. Very hard to put on. Maybe if you are a size 14 or below it might do something but not for the plus size woman.
3,Wasn't happy,"The sizing chart wasn't as accurate as i thought. The shipping took at least two weeks. When i got it i tried it on and it wasn't as tight as i liked it. I ordered a small since my waist size is a 26 but it fit a little loose. It does do its job but it doesn't give me the look that i wanted. It also shows the brackets when you put a shirt over it. It kind of looks like you have had your stomach cut open. Another con about this product is once your wearing it, the back of it rides up and it makes your arch on your back look distorted."
4,Great to flatten your tummy - not so much to narrow your waist,"I ordered this to wear with a clingy dress for Valentine's Day. Ordered the 3X/36 and the 4X/38, and I'll definitely be going with the 36. According to their size chart I should be 4X/38, and it definitely flattens my tummy, but the 3X/36 does the same and nips me in a bit more without creating any bulges at the top or bottom.If you're going for that super curvy hourglass figure, this is probably not going to be quite enough for you. But if you're just looking to slim down a bit and get rid of that food baby, it's excellent. It's very comfortable and of high quality - the stays are very sturdy, as is the fabric. The back and sides are sheer, so it doesn't have that horrible medical-garment look to it, either."
2,I do not care for this cincher,"It is simultaneously too big (even though I ordered down a size indicated from the size chart, I can slip my finger between the garment and my skin if I suck in) and too small - too short, as it's cut up in the front - which makes it flip up in the back."
4,Satisfied with purchase,"I really like this item especially for its price. It visibly makes a difference on instantly. Seems comfortable but haven't worn it for a long period if time. If the outline shoes through your shirt, you can wear a tank top to hide the outline. Just make sure you get your correct size so it works."
1,ummmm,I got a size bigger so it will not bend but that didnt work the quality is great but it just doesnt do the job i was asking for. I guess i was expecting a miracle but i guess its back to the diet n gym i go
4,Explorations of the mellow,"This remix album takes the mellower, lounge-y side of the 4 Hero album and pushes that. I greatly enjoyed the remixes of Planetaria and Star Chasers, they put a new spin on the jazzy, soulful side of the group. The Escape That remixes are interesting, but they may or may not hold up to repeated listening because the original was so good. The rest of the album doesn't stick out in my mind either way, but it's definitely solid listening. If you are looking for something Rainer Truby might pick as opposed to something Goldie would pick, you could work with this one. Relax and put it on next time you want to have a soiree or just some scotch."
3,"Just not enough change,man.","Well,worra disapointment! Two Pages was the best album ever released by a Drum and Bass artist..but this takes tunes from the original and makes them worse. Escape That has been ruined along with Star Chasers...only The Action and the two We who are not as others inspire me and make me happy about spending 14.99 for it.I expected better."
1,A disappointment,This book is a disappointment. It is the first cookbook that I have read that contains baking recipes without including the required oven temperature. It is not for serious food lovers.I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking Polish recipes - in fact I would gladly return it if it were possible.
1,This book could be a magazine article,"First, to be fair, the author's make some mildly helpfull points. However, anyone who has spent even a few hours interviewing builders and/or architects will already be familiar with most of the points made. The book is very brief. Only the first 30 pages are actual text. The remainder of the book is example forms (4 copies of each to add girth to book, no doubt). I should think that anyone, after building one home, could write as well or better."
4,Rock City Angels,"Ok this album was intended to be released before their debut ""young mans blues"". I loved YMB, so was thrilled to see this CD finally out. It's musically different, but still rocks.If you like the New York Dolls, you'll love this CD. It could be a dolls release. I havn't heard a band sound so much like a single influence since Rhinobucket released thier AC/DC influenced debut. Bobby Durango sounds just like David Johannson, and they even do a Johnny Thunders cover.If you like raw sleazy rock check in out."
3,"I play on the disk, but don't get credit","The mix isn't bad but it's got a lot of reverb. I don't understand why Dirty Dave and I don't get credit for playing on the six tracks we are on. I even wrote the music to 'Need Some Luv.' Some of the original backing vocals were mixed out, leaving a bit of a whole in the music. I guess I've been listening to my original mixes from the sessions for to many years and just got used to them. It's good to see that stuff finally get released though. I like the re-recordings of LA Woman, Lipstick Boys, Lets Go!(originally, Big Black Cadillac), Dark Angels,and Cherry Street, but the other six tunes have Taggart on guitar and Dirty Dave Johns on drums. I think I should have received a free copy at least. Good Health and Memory Angels, Peace"
2,What Happened?,"Not really sure what happened here. Billed as a reunion with esteemed past members of the Horace Silver Quintet (especially the Brecker Brothers), this CD disappoints. The batch of tunes Horace assembled is quite undistinguished, mostly simple blues forms with some hesitant soloing by the leader. Each tune seems like a pastiche of a real Silver song.Obviously, he was told there would be no vocalizing this time out, even though he had written a complete batch of lyrics. Was Horace disappointed? Resentful? I also think that symptoms of his later affliction may have begun to appear."
4,wonderful music & wondeful music for classical dance,"I was a little skeptical the first time I heard Marcel Khalife wrote music for orchestra (I had only heard his ""Jadal"" album at this point.) A friend gave me ""Summer Night's Dream"" and man, was I impressed! His writing for classical dance goes right up there with Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and others who wrote great dance music!The melodies are full and rich. This is definately music written in the east though. There are plenty of arabic instruments (kanun, oud, etc) in addition to the western orchestra. There's great development in the pieces and you can certainly tell that there is a progressing story. Khalife has managed to successfully bridge the gap between east & west with this CD. That's not to say that this is fusion music...it is far from it, however, this is certainly music that can appeal to folks from both sides of the world.This CD is excellent, and highly recommended (not to mention that we share a last name!)"
4,Oriental Classical Music,"Summer Night's Dream is how the orient views classical music which the Europeans invented. It allows for instruments such as the lute, nai, riqq and even buzuq to interact with the usual ones. Marcel's work is a must for whoever needs to discover the struggle and harmony that the oriental culture consists of."
4,What is the model number for this item?,What is the model number for this item? I want to verify this before I place the order. Thanks.
5,I feel so good!,"I initially bought this for my six year old daughter to get more vitamins into her diet - but she found out this was a kind of 'medicine' and she is absolutely against it. I didn't want to take it back, so I've been taking a spoonful in rice milk before bed and WOWZA.... my sinuses have never felt so clear before bed! How weird is that, I know, but seriously, I refuse to go to bed at night without taking a drink of this awesome stuff. I wake up less groggy, my sinuses are cleared the night before. I don't want to be without it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2,pass on this - too much overtalk by the narrator,"Will the people who make these things ever learn how to do it properly? Although there are few complete performances here, the DVD is marred by the frequent and all too predictible overtalk by the punter who narrates the DVD, riuning the said performances. In addition to the annoyance of such narration, the people who do it usually don't know as much about the band in question as those viewing the DVD. Bottom line. Pass on this. If you want high quality Kinks performances, I'm certain you will be able to find plenty of ""alternative"" DVDs out there.Don't buy this garbage or anything like it. Send a message to video producers: ""IT IS NOT ABOUT THEM OR THE NARRATOR, IT IS ABOUT THE MUSIC, STUPID!!"""
2,Don't waste your time,"I hate to give less than 4 stars to anything Kinks related, but this DVD does not even begin to do the Kinks story justice. I am a die-hard Kinks fan and I couldn't even make it half way through. . . the video quality and sound quality are dreadful, and to be honest, it just seems like they pieced together various clips together with no rhyme or reason to it. If you want to watch a high quality documentary on the history of the Kinks I recommend going to iTunes and downloading The Biography Channel's fantastic Kinks documentary for $1.99!! It is cheaper and 100000000x better than this waste of money and time."
3,Not what it should have been.,"The Kinks were one of the best groups to come out of the British Invasion and laid the groundwork for many types of music. This DVD is disappointing on many fronts, the sound is uneven (too loud in spots, too soft in others), the narrative is boring and repetative, the DVD focuses too much on the later years and does not pay enough attention to the early and mid-period of the band, and not all of the members of the band are given their fair share of attention. The only positive aspect of the DVD is that many of the older, lost performances are represented."
5,Deserves the highest recommendation to fellow music lovers from all walks of life,"You Really Got Me: The Story of The Kinks is a rousing DVD collection of footage from The Kinks, one of few British bands that has been commercially successful in America. Covering the band's career from the sixties to the nineties, You Really Got Me includes highlights from the band's greatest moments on stage; their most beloved songs; and comments from band members including Ray Davies, Dave Davies, and Mick Avory. ""You Really Got Me"" deserves the highest recommendation to fellow music lovers from all walks of life. 87 minutes, colour and black & white."
1,The good songs are missing,"The soundtrack to this movie was ecclectic and truly great. The movie mixed Gavin Friday rockers with Van Morrison's Madam George with The Buffalo Springfield's For What It's Worth and added several really great songs by virtual unknowns. Unfortunately, whoever selected the songs for this CD thought commonplace marginal songs like Patti Page's How much is that doggie in the window or Bobby Goldsboro's Honey was the key to capturing the essense of this movie. It boggles the mind. There are a few good songs on the CD like Sugar Baby Love,Children of the Revlolution and a Gavin Friday or two song but It's unfortunate that you can't get all of the really good songs from this movie and have to settle for watching the movie so that you can hear snippits of the best songs in the movie....but I'd rather do that than listen to dribble like Morris Alberts Wedding fare, Feelings. Save Your Money!"
4,A Four Star 'Breakfast',"Although some of the songs on this soundtrack aren't nearly as good as the others, it's well worth it for the ones that stand out. This is not your typical soundtrack with popular songs that everyone will know - in fact, the best ones are those that I hadn't heard before.Highlights - 'Sugar Baby Love' 'Good Looking Woman' 'Breakfast on Pluto' 'Sand' 'Children of the Revolution' and 'Wig Wam Bam'This is definitely a great soundtrack as far as soundtracks go and worth more than what it costs in dollars."
2,not what i expected,I saw the movie and enjoyed it. One of the reasons I stemmed from the good music played throughout. Turns out some of the songs I had more interest in were not on the soundtrack.
1,disappointed,i was very disappointed with this cd as it skipped on the songs-it seems as if it had been damaged and resold
5,"Gravity : different, sleeker, still OLP, still rocks.","Yes Our Lady Peace have changed, but they still have that special something that makes them better than all the other bands. Even though at first listen the tracks strike you as sleeker then previous OLP cd's, they still hit the deep emotional part that is so important in music. Most Pop-rock bands forget this key that ties your soul and mind to the music. Besides being an more personal album Gravity really rocks. My favorite songs are ""not enough"", ""do you like it"" and the moving ""bring back the sun"". The uplifting and Upbeat ""innocent is a good example of Olp's ability to help us notice the good in the face of hard times. Overall this is my favorite cd purchase of 2002."
2,Not Their Best,"I love OLP, and I have for years. That's part of the reason why I won't listen to this album. I gave it 2 stars simply because this band can't produce anything that completely sucks. The 'pro' who reviewed this album for amazon.com must not have listened to any of OLP's other albums, because it's a crime to say they aren't 'inventive'. Listen to Clumsy, to Naveed, and especially to Happiness..., but leave this record for the radio. I understand there's a point in any musicians life where you just want to make a buck, but when OLP moved in this new direction, they lost a lot of what makes thier fans love them. I'll always support OLP, but I can't listen to this album without wondering is they've left their fans behind."
2,What happened?,"I am a huge fan of Our Lady Peace. I became a fan about 4 years ago with ""Happiness is not a fish you can catch,"" and my love for them skyrocketed with ""Clumsy,"" and ""Spiritual Machines,"" so when I found out ""Gravity"" was coming out, I took the first chance I got to pre-order it. And what did I think when I heard it? ""Is this the same band?"" They lost almost all of their individuality with this album. Gone are the soulful lyrics of their previous 3 albums. They went from amazing to cookie-cutter in 1 album."
2,The sinking of the titanic,"I've been an OLP fan for many years and this album isn't quite worth the acclaim the others have been noted for. It was a breakthrough album helping the band regain a large portion of recognition in the states because of one large radio hit. ""Somewhere Out There"" is a good song, but they somewhat crossed over into the radio-friendly world of pop and left their breathtaking creativity behind with Mike Turner in the dust somewhere. Notable tracks ""All For You"" and the Leppard-esque ""Not Enough"" give this album a rating of 2."
4,Give them a break!,"As one of the only people I know who likes Our Lady Peace, I have a hard time understanding why. Gravity is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I like a variety of music, but OLP will always be at the top of my list. The songs on Gravity are moving, musically brilliant, and they are easy to sing along with. I have been waiting for months for this album, and I am NOT disappointed."
5,Not Enough,"This albom is my favorate for 2002 - so far. Almost every songhere can become a big hit. The songs are melodic, the singer isgreat. If you like Creed, Incubus, POM ... you gona love thisone. Buy this albom just for one of best songs ever - ""NotEnough"" - The first time I listen to it I start to shake,and when it ends I needed to wash my eyes from the tears."
4,"Not as original, but worth rockin out to","After getting obsessed with Happiness..., Clumsy, Spiritual Machines and Naveed, I had no problem getting into Gravity. Once I listened to the whole CD, I began to realize that the talent's still there. Yeah, with Turner leaving the band, there's a lack of the great guitar we're all used to, but they're still OLP, they're not selling out. You just can't expect EVERY CD to be the ""best."" OLP's still got it going on, and they still don't get the recognition that they deserve. The talent's there, and hopefully more people will begin to see that. This album is worth the money, I love it... Bring Back the Sun is a great Ballad, while All For You is a GREAT opening slammer. Most of the originality is still there, OLP's still awesome. I can't wait to hear more. Bottom line: BUY IT."
4,mixed feelings,"On one hand, I like this album. A lot. I'll play it on repeat, get the songs stuck in my head, they all sound pretty damn nice and they sound like... our lady peace.But on the other hand I'm dissapointed. I've been an our lady peace fan for more than a year now and all their other albums have been so brilliant. Especially clumsy, which is my favorite album. but this album doesn't seem to have the brilliantly creative and somewhat quirky lyrics that they've had in the past. Which was the biggest reason i loved our lady peace so much.I'm not saying this is a bad album or even that you shouldn't buy it. I just know that our lady peace could have done better. It almost sounds like they are trying to sound more like bands that are popular these days. Some of their lyrics are a bit bland. But all in all, I still like the album and I'm still glad I bought it. My favorite tracks are innocent and not enough."
2,Bob Rock-ed,"There's not a whole lot that can be added to what real fans of OLP have already said. Compared to most of what you hear on the mainstream radio today, this album will stand out a bit. However, compared to all of OLP's previous 4 albums, this one is crap. The vocals are boring and repetitive, the songs are boring and repetitive, the lyrics are boring and repetitive... basically, ""boring and repetitive"" describes this cd. What kind of a name is Bob Rock, anyway?? If you are even friends with someone with a name like ""Bob Rock"", it should be a clue to you that youre a tool, and everyone is probably standing around making fun of you. The only people who will buy this album and love it are 9 yr olds and tranvestite strippers, or both. If you plan on buying this album, take the $18.99, buy a good kitchen knife, and castrate yourself so your future retarded children wont be around to promote crappy sell-out music."
1,Don't bother,"Not nearly as good as previous releases (Clumsy being my favorite). This is formula rock, and I suppose if this is what you want then go for it, I would just prefer to listen to some of the other albums. I'm just glad I got it for [less]."
3,............,"I love Our Lady Peace, but honestly, I thought Gravity was horrible compared to OLP's old stuff. OLP's last CDs (Naveed, Clumsy, Happiness... Is Not A Fish That You Can Catch and Spiritual Machines) I thought, really stood out among most music, like on the radio and stuff. I thought it was very different and unique. Gravity took all the talent they have, put it in a nutshell and released it to the pop world. Rock made it so simple sounding, which I think, isn't OLP at all. They should have stuck with Lanni, and I don't know why they let Turner go, he was an awesome guitarist that helped make OLP so unique. But, don't listen to me, I don't know anything."
3,"Good album, But not the Best of Our Lady's Albums","I had the chance to hear the new album live at a small club performance 3 weeks before it came out. While I admit it is a good album, it is not the best of all of Our Lady's albums. Perhaps I had the upper hand and was not as shocked as many were when first hearing it. Hey, It's hard to top spiritual machines and happiness.Gravity is a nice change of pace, but might seem a bit dissapointing to those who were looking for the typical Our Lady Peace style. Hey, you've gotta flex a bit to find staying power in music. For having just recruited a new guitarist during the actual recording of this album, I say it's great. Give them a bit more time together...they will gel as they've done before."
4,"Different, But Good","With the hiring of producer Bob Rock (famous for Metallica's Black Album), the leaving of guitarist Mike Turner, and subtle changes such as placing a photgraph of the band on the cover of the album, Our Lady peace is trying one final attempt to make it big in the United States. Fans of the band will no doubt cry ""sell-out"", but the album, although losing the distinct sound of other OLP albums, is still a good rock record. Songs like ""Innocent"" and ""Made of Steel"" are solid alternative rockers while the erie ""Somewhere Out There"" and the catchy ""All for You"" are more in line with their previous outings. All in all Gravity is a solid listen for all rock fans. .... Good luck to OLP, I hope this album brings them the success they deserve in the States."
4,This is the Our Lady Peace we've been missing for two CDs,"OLP came out with Naveed, their first, grungy CD followed by Clumsy of almost the same caliber. Raine's voice blew me away on these two CDs. The way he could change from the typical 90's grunge sound to a higher pitch, while keeping the song from turning into a mess. When Happiness... came out it just seemed that OLP had gone through a testing phase with a new type of music and did a great job but Spiritual Machines came out with the same type of sound and the new type of music OLP had created on their first two CDs were lost. But now we have Gravity, the in-between of the two types of sounds that Our Lady Peace have played around with and it seems this works the best, rather than one or the other. I'm not going to go through each individual song like some people do, but if you like the sound of Happiness.. and Spiritual Machines, but miss the sound of Clumsy and Naveed, make sure you pick up Gravity."
2,gone too pop...,"I was sucked into buying this CD after reading some decent reviews and hearing the new single ""somewhere out there"", and actually enjoying it. Our Lady Peace has a great fanbase and they used to be able to seperate themselves from the other rock bands with creative riffs and good lyrics. but this cd is terrible. From the minute i popped it in, i kept thinking corny radio-friendly music played at top 40 radio, like linkin park, puddle of mudd, and nickelback. i know they are better than this, but this CD shows no talent or creativity onesohever and i am very disappointed. they have gone to their last resort to find success in the US--> selling out to top 40 radio."
3,Well....,"I kind of suspected this to happen. I absolutely fell in love with Spiritual Machines. Now i normally listen to stuff like Boards of Canada, Pavement, and Yo La Tengo, so it took a lot for me to really want to buy Spiritual Machines, but after hearing the album once from a friend, i knew i'd love it. But now, ""gravity"" is just radio friendly rock. Maybe one or two stand out tracks, but really they all feel the same. As well the new guitarist is really one dimensional, no real talent, only know a distortion pedal. If there is one thing to really latch onto, it's that Raine's lyrics and vocals are as good as ever. And i really don't like Bob Rock, bring back Lanni, Rock's production is too slick. I still think it's a worth purchase though now, before they jack the price up. Because in the end it's not as good as Spiritual Machines, but it is decent, and probably the best commercial album this year."
3,Bittersweet release...,"The very mention of the albums title will bring fiery discontent to the eyes of any Our Lady Peace fan who has been with the band since it's debut (myself included). I hate this album, and everything it stands for. I only hope that when the band sits down to record the next album, the sessions are preceeded by a unanimous ""Oops."", and things return to normal.So why three stars? Because the album is consistent with itself. As a stand-alone release, it's decent music. Mainstream music fans will enjoy these songs a lot, and that's obviously what the band was going for (enlisting the well-known Bob Rock (Metallica, Aerosmith) to aid them in it's production).As a fan of the band, however, I can only hope that this was just a phase. I hope they got everything out of their systems, because the world doesn't need another four-chords with heavy distortion, 'miss the girl' rock band... it needs another Our Lady Peace."
3,"Sold out, but not burnt out","The fifth and latest album from post-grunge band Our Lady Peace, Gravity is disticntly different from their previous four albums. Missing their former guitarist Mike Turner and Raine Maida's whining, crying falsetto, it seems much as if the group has sold out. In fact, many of their fans claim this. Even the cover of the album seems more like a mainstream pop album than their previous, bizzare covers.Yet, even though the group has ""sold out,"" it's still better than most other music you can find out there. The album is still distinctly an Our Lady Peace album, and Mike worked with the band on two tracks. While it's not Spiritual Machines or Happiness...., it's still a solid album. Buy this one after you've got those two."
1,Oh dear...,"It's been nearly a year since this album came out and I'm a U.K. fan as well as a long time fan. The truth is I can listen to this album and think its good... its okay... but that's all. Hate to sound like everyone else but while I like it as an album I hate it as an OLP album. All for progression and moving on hell I even liked adore... but this is a devolution designed to grab the nu-pop generation. Nothing against there new guitarist he's good and all but Mike if your out there i'm with you it was time to leave. The sound is, well you've heard it before its creedish very typical and radio rock. The albums sound lacks the depth of all previous releases. Its almost laughable to think that if you sat around a table with these guys they'd try to convice you that this was there finest hour... I'd love to hear there arguements, i really would it would be comical."
4,Our Lady Peace Beginners,"I find it very hard to believe that there are many reviewers out there who seem to think that they know all about Our Lady Peace. I also find it hard to believe that they seem to think that they can over analyze a cd that seems to return OLP to some of their origninal roots. To call ""Gravity"" a primarily pop album, would be contradicting everything that holds true about alternative music. This cd is, by far, one of their better cds, since spiritual machines and the whole eastern influence didnt really work for them. The music on this album is catchy, melodic, and highly addictive. It not only represents many of the things that the group portrayed in albums such as clumsy and happiness is..., but adds a fresh flair with a new guitarist. This album comes highly recommended from someone who is tired of bands selling out to the majority of pop fans, and is glad to see our lady peace returning to their signature style and unique alternative rock blend."
5,OLP'S BEST,"This CD I think is Our Lady's Peace best. I think the top best 5 songs on the CD are. All For You, Do You Like It, Somewhere Out There, Innocent, Made Of Steel. Don't get me wrong here because Not Enough, Sell My Soul, Sorry, Bring Back The Sun, A Story About A Girl are are all awesome too. This CD is a must get for OLP's, Alternative Rock, and Rock listeners. You will enjoy this CD very very much."
2,disappointing,"if this album had arrived after naveed or clumsy, i would have received it better. but after watching the band grow better and better with each album, reaching their peak with spiritual machines, gravity was quite a disappointment. bands who experiment should keep experimenting, not produce a way-too-made-for-radio product. newer fans may enjoy this album, but for we longtime fans, it's rather a letdown, especially after such an eager wait.it's nowhere near as soulful, or strong lyrically. many of the lyrics play heavily with repetition, which is good for a few songs, but song after song of repetitive lyrics is a bit grating.for a cd, i admit it's okay. but for our lady peace--not good enough."
2,A clarification to my previous review..,"It seems I was in error on a bit of text during my review of Gravity, and I am writing to clear one thing up. During my section which mentions the aim of producer Bob Rock to make Our Lady Peace ""the next big Canadian group"" to break out in America, I mistakingly identified him as having produced Nickelback's Silver Side Up, which I later found to be inaccurate. These two albums do share the same mixing engineer, Randy Staub, which likely led to this incorrect correlation, so I guess I was only half right! Still, with that said, I feel the aim of this production team here was to throw OLP onto the Nickelback bandwagon by homogenizing the quirkiness that gives OLP such an engaging quality, and shaping them towards something more commercial, thus breaking them out by riding on Nickelback's coattails. Given the sudden hipness of mainstream Canadian bands in America, I'm fairly sure this was exactly their intention."
3,"dull, but still good","While I'm not an anti-mainstream snob, I just find most rock music uninteresting. So when I first heard ""Gravity"", I actually felt bored. Powerchords all the way through, no melodic layers in the music, tunes didn't stand out to me, and no jazz drumming. Yawn.Granted, after listening to repeatedly, it grew on me. All For You, Not Enough, Bring Back The Sun, and Innocent (though cheesy) are actually good songs. I even started to appreciate rhythm guitar. This is a decent album, but I just wish the band hadn't thrown so much of their old style out the window. They seem to be confusing simplicity with blandness.If your quirks are a vital part of your music, and not superimposed on top, you can have a simplicity that is both sophisticated and interesting. Instead, they've approached simplification with a steamroller and a straight-jacket. Hopefully they bounce back a bit with their next album."
4,Another very good CD,"I'm very happy with this CD.They've gone to a more mainstream sound here, but the lead singer's uniqiue vocal style and the band's talent & ability to create atmosphere help separate it from other stuff out there.I do miss the old guitarist's neat guitar work, but the straight forward denser guitar sound here does provide a good contrast to the vocals in my opinion.I don't think there is one bad song on this CD.""Somewhere Out There"" is obviously a great radio friendly song,""Not Enough"", ""Sorry"", the haunting ""Bring Back The Sun"" are some of the songs I like best.My favorite OLP CD is ""Naveed"", ""Gravity"" is #2, I'm not saying it's better than the others, I just like it more and think the sound change is to a good effect.Over all this is a very likeable set of tunes that has me excited about the future of this great band."
4,Our Lady Peace's new cd Gravity,I heard the song Somewhere Out There on the radio several times. After listening to some sample tracks at the music store I bought this cd. I very pleased that I did as this cd has a variety of songs that show the bands versatility as well as musical style. If you're a person that likes the sounds of the more modern music of todays generation you'll probably like this cd as well. It rocks with out being overly heavy but yet keeps you pumped up while listening to it.
5,A VERY KAC CD,I am so glad I bought this cd. I seriously can not wait to get up in the morning pr take a shower to listen to it. The words and the music it's self are GREAT!!!!! I really think anyone who buys this cd will enjoy it.
3,Do YOU like it?,"When I first started listening to Our Lady Peace, the enigmatic vocals and the awesome music behind Raine Maida's voice drew me in. Gravity is totally different. The old Our Lady Peace was eerie and had a creepy sound to them that was so alien to the American ear that it was either totally accepted or utterly hated. Their sound stayed the same during the first four albums, but Bob Rock took the helm, producing Gravity. Rock, who produced an album for Metallica, took what was OLP and made it into part of the machine we now call ""rock"". What happened to the ellusive and cryptic lyrics of ""Spiritual Machines"" or the cutting rifts on ""Clumsy""? Please, Our Lady Peace, if you are reading this, don't fall into the trap that is modern music. You seem to be on the brink, and you need to reaslize that if you do, you will take one of the best bands of all time down."
3,From Creative to Radio Friendly,"From the point when I heard ""Somewhere Out There"" I knew this band was not the same. What a difference the departure of Turner made. This band does not sound nothing like before instead drifting into the radio friendly path of many bands of these days. So sad from a band who took out ""Naveed & Superman's Dead"". The album has a few good songs (Bring Back The Sun, Not Enough), still not the same OLP of 10 years ago."
5,awesome,"This CD is great. I just picked it up last night and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. It is so good. It's a lot heavier than Spiritual Machines, even heavier than Naveed in some places. It's so good though. Get it if you're a fan of the band, and even if you're not"
1,Glen Ballard is The Kiss of Death to All Artists,"This guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers. OLP have no business working with him and the result shows. OLP is way out of Ballards league and I have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music. Perhaps OLP wanted to have a sell-out sound, otherwise this disc is a disaster. Somewhere out there is pure disposable pop. None of this material would be on ""Happiness"" or ""Spiritual Machines"" How can you go from a concept album from a Ray Kurzveil book to a horrible Glen Ballard. over produced, pop record?"
5,Gravity - OLP,"I just cant get sick of listenning to OLP! Even if i like the spiritual machines album better! OLP is one of my favorite bands, and i think it's a shame that we dont talk about them so much in France! Actually they're unknown here, but fortunately i could get the cds through the amazon website! They're really talented and the music they play is so great! but in France people like to listen to music that sounds s**t! I really hope that french people will make some progress and open their mind!!"
2,Raine Maida said Mike was limited no Raine this is limited..,"My feelings about this album... well it is poor because Our Lady Peace always had a unique sound and now quite frankly now they sound like everyone else out there. I'm going to agree with the others who have reviewed this album that Bob Rock is no Arnold Lanni this is a luke warm album. They produced the whole thing in ten weeks and believe me you can tell the whole thing feels rushed, I mean even the cover look at it, grey yeah it is quite fitting. Some think this is a return to OLP's roots I disagree I've been a fan of there's eight years If there going to make more albums like this they should change there name I don't want the words Our Lady Peace on this material. Thank you Mr Bob Rock."
2,Good times rolled off a cliff...,"I have been an Our Lady Peace fan for some time now. I bought Spiritual Machines and it was great. Bought Happiness...one of the best albums I own or even heard. Ended up buying Clumsy too and it did not disappoint. Gravity on the other hand did disappoint. I heard Somewhere Out There on the radio and I was less then impressed. But it sounded like radio type music, popular stuff, so I figured Id check out some other songs. That was a waste of my time. I didnt really think about its Creedness until I read a different review, and Id have to agree. Not worth the time or the money, especially for a college student like myself."
3,Our Lady Peace? Are you sure?,"Naveed was pretty good, Clumsy was better, Happiness.. was incredible, Spiritual Machines was revolutionary... and then along comes the accurately-titled, uninspired Gravity, whose overwhelming drollness throws us right back down into the depths of mainstream ...rock with the likes of Three Doors Down and Lifehouse. What ...happened? Sure, it's a listenable album, and it's more accessible to the public - but it sounds like a completely different band. If you're looking for an actual Our Lady Peace album, pick up Happiness is not a Fish that You Can Catch."
5,They have done it again!,"Our lady peace has not let us down again! With their new album, Gravity, they are still on a roll with Raine's amazing lyrics and the beat of Jeremy's drums that gives you a tingle in your spine. Now, their 5th album, the CD includes the catchy, ""Do You Like It"" the hit that has been playing on MTV like wildfire, ""Somewhere Out There"" and songs that are mostly sympathizing for others and songs that so intuitively describes the pain and troubles in relationships. This album has been a part of a continuous progression throughout their albums seeing and learning how Raine has matured and his view on how people feel, his own self included. This album is yet another shockingly straight forward collection of writings put into music."
5,Great!,"Being a huge Our Lady Peace fan, I bought GRAVITY the day it came out. It's a great CD, and the songs are just so meaningful. My favorite songs are ""Innocent,"" ""Made of Steel,"" ""A Story About A Girl,"" and ""Not Enough."" The other six songs are awesome too, and if there's anything that could be better about OLP's fifth (!) album, it's that it could have more songs."
5,"new album gravity has me floating,","our lady peace has a way of putting their words in my mouth. i can relate to everything on any occasion. they are moving, and inspirational. the new cd GRAVITY should be a must have in everyone's cd collection. don't be left out in the cold...buy this cd and let the magic of our lady peace fill your ears!"
3,"A Great Band, But Buy Some of Their Other CD's First","This is not Our Lady Peace's best work. It sounds like they're trying harder to reach the mainstream crowd this time. As far as success goes, this strategy obviously didn't work, so now we're left with their least impressive album. Sure, everything on here is well-done, but there isn't much music on here that will hook you. The opener ""All For You"" is a tired, melancholic song that only leaves more desire for the older Alternative/Indie Rock sound. Songs like ""Somewhere Out There"" and ""Innocent"" may leave a positive impression the first time around, but still, this just isn't a very breathtaking peace of work. Not what Our Lady Peace needs to finally break through and become popular in the states. Not terrible, but not as good as their earlier stuff by any means."
4,Creed knock off my a**,"To the person that wrote the first review saying that OLP is a Creed knock, you got your timelines wrong. OLP has been around a lot longer than Creed has been so if anything Creed is a knock off of OLP. Though not their best album, it still has its' high points. I suggest you listen to some of their earlier stuff like Naveed. Then tell me that they are a Creed knock."
2,Could've been a lot better than this.,"I bought this CD a week ago and it was a bit disappointing. The music isn't hard enough. I like hard rock/pop and heavy metal, but Gravity is nothing more than just another boyband. The only song I really liked was track # 6 ""Not Enough"", which is very moving. Tracks # 2 and 5 were O.K. but not worth listening to all the time. Our Lady Peace is a sellout. This album proves it. Buy Vertical Horizon or Linkin Park, but avoid this. The singing is cheesy and the music stinks for the most part."
2,"For Shame Guys, For Shame","I absolutley enjoy listing to OLP's older realeses, but this new more modren, less Meaning full lyrics, and vocals has caught me dissapointed. I cant wait to go to there Show in Calgary Alberta, on the January 27 2003, but im not really looking forward to there new promotion to this CD.I did run out and buy the First copy and the DVD copy when they came out... (*im sorry i love OLP to much and ever So Much)) but I find my self listing to the cd Clumsy, Neevada,ect.. way more offten then I do to this new clatter...I LOVE OLPS MUSIC, but this time guys you hit rock bottom :("
2,A Disappointment to OLP fans,"As much as I love OLP, this just doesn't sound like them. The heartwrenching, insightful lyrics and experimental sound that set OLP apart aren't on this album. I disliked Somewhere Out There because it was so mainstream sounding. It made me feel as if OLP was dumbing down their music for Joe MusicFan, and abandoning the rabidly loyal fanbase they've set up over the years. I used to take something away from every OLP album, and this one could have been any other run of the mill alt rock band. I hope OLP realizes their music is good the way it is, or was, and goes back to what we know and love. Gravity is a quality album just because of the caliber of the musicians that play on it, but other then that, it's just not the band what I've come to love.To anyone looking to buy this album, I would say, listen to Happiness... Is a Fish You Cannot Catch, Clumsy, Spiritual Machines, or Naveed if you want to hear Our Lady Peace. This album doesn't do them justice."
