3,speatzle schmeckt gut,makes real schpaetzle however not the best engeniering I've ever used. the upper part moves a kind of loose on the main part therefore it takes too much effort to make the pasta.
2,item not as pictured,"Works okay, but the hopper becomes rusty after first use. While the grater probably is stainless steel, the hopper certainly isn't (it's cheap metal, not plastic as in the product description and picture). If one uses a spatula to press the dough through the holes, the grater is still useful."
3,Making Spaetzel,"For the price this item gets the job done and works well, it is just messy. Still looking for a better Spaetzel Maker that does not cost a fortune."
3,Special Features not so Special,"I would have given this movie four stars for many of the reasons already covered in other reviews, but I have to lower the rating because on the commentary track, there are clearly two people, but we only know that because one guy pauses and responds to the other guy. We don't hear the other person! Fortunately, the one person conveys a lot of info, but I bet the other person says interesting things. And it's annoying to hear him respond with no knowledge of what is being said. I wouldn't buy it for this reason."
5,good filter,This filter fits perfectly in my 2002 Hyundai Elantra. It was really easy to replace the old filter with this one. It was one of the first things I did after buying the Elantra pre-owned.
5,Bettter than I remember...,I received the item before the date promised. The package was perfect. No mars and/or problems. I plan on purchasing the remaining box sets. I would not hesitate to order from this company again. I say go for it. You will not be sorry.
4,"Great, but....","OK, this is hands down my most favorite television series of all time. And these DVD sets are great for my collection. But what I don't understand is why the episodes are out of order. ""Subway"" is not the 4th episode of the season, it's the 6th. A tell tale sign is when Frank is asked how many kids he has he says ""two"", not ""one and one on the way"". That's because ""Subway"" aired after ""Birthday"", the episode in which Mary gives birth to their son. I'm not, by any means saying not to buy this collection, it just bugs me."
3,"Here we go, though a little fast putting these sets out.","Well here we go again.I hope A&E; actually took the viewers advice and actually put some thought and care into this new set.I mean with all the dough we have to put out, it's only right.And in this season Junior Bunk goes mad in the squad house shooting up the joint, now if anyone remembers in season 7 Baylis is remembering what happened and they show the scene of Junior Bunk in WIDESCREEN! So listen NBC and A&E;, treat the show right we know you can make it WIDESCREEN so do it to it man!And for craps sake, how about some damn DELEATED SCENES?We know there are some, the actors even talked about some cut out for time.And NBC even joined two episodes with new footage, so its there, just dig it up.I must be the only kat who cares about this show."
5,A great read,I ordered this book primary because of my interest in service animals. There is a great deal of good information about service dogs in the book but the stories were so compelling I could not put it down. It is a great read.
5,Musical snapshot of a great variety show+,"I don't even remember those quality 'variety shows'.Yet,thanks to 'YouTube',you can see the various musical shows from yesterday.I had ordered this dvd,and it was well worth watching.So many talented singers,from their twilight years or those just arising to stardom.'The Andy Williams Collection' is perfect to watch,and see all the stars of yesteryear shine.Sadly,music shows today are rehashing old tunes.The classical lyrics are clear and the songs smooth honey-flowing.Some of the teeny glam bands can't be understood.Thesedays,the words are even more banal and the music manufactured simply to sell for a fast buck.The classics are still the best.Enjoy this dvd!"
3,Not as helpful as it could be,"In reading the book, there were many great platform idependant ideas for debugging applications. I think it would have been more helpful if the book would have at least cursorily implemented some of those ideas in code (my preference being C/C++). Some examples of what I mean are it says that one of the oldest ways of debugging applications use a log. It even goes to say what elements to include to make it as useful as possible. I think it would have been better to include the code implementing a logger they describe."
3,Hat,"I turned my twins into thing 1 and thing 2 for Halloween. I will wear a Cat in the Hat - Hat. My hubby is gonna wear this hat. It is awful tight, but gets the job done. And it makes a great conversation piece, but kinds takes the attention away from the twins."
3,kayson,"i this thought this dvd was hardcore ladies wresting but it strippers fighting strippers but some of the regular matches was alright or decent but this dvd is not really for litter kids advisory ""semi-nude ladies"" in this dvd hope this review was helpful."
5,the Stars say I loved it,"There is nothing like watchin hot, badly trained exotic dancers beating the poop out of each other. A nice little bit of nudity. I personally recomend it."
5,"*Great* book, but recommend Hardback.","I can't say enough about what a great story this is. And the illustrations are fabulous, too! My two and four y/o love this book; and I do too! I never tire of reading it. It's especially good in conjunction with FIAR and Homeschoolshare. HOWEVER... I bought the paperback, because I was having trouble finding a HB copy. I am very careful - okay... neurotic! - about treating books well especially around little kids. This book remained put up and we would get it out 2-3 times a day and sit in the chair and read it together. There was absolutely no abuse to the book, but after two weeks pages 1-16 fell plop! out of the book and onto the floor. Then the next night more pages began to loosen. It is only glued and apparently not that well. I guess I'm going to staple it together for now. But I'm going to be looking to replace it with a HB, because it is very much loved. I recommend trying to find a HB copy... this is too good a book to miss!"
4,One of the best paper yo-yos,"The quality of this yo-yo is excellent! The stick itself is of a fairly durable plastic, but still a tube as opposed to a solid cylinder. The paper is well-waxed and they're plenty of it; I'd estimate that it can extend to about 3 feet with a very smooth flicking action. Definitely a good value for the money!"
3,Partial order,"Product exactly as pictured on advertisement. Received within stated time frame. However, received only a portion of quantity ordred. No indication whether unfilled quantity will be send."
2,Wait for it go on sale.... for it surely will.,"I give this movie one star for the sharks, as previous reviewers mentioned the shark footage is pretty amazing, and one star split between wonderful shots of S Africa and equally, (for this viewer) pleasant shots of Mr Martinez. The story line itself was almost unpalatable. As someone else stated, mbee for the girls, I doubt even then. Without giving any spoilers there is little to say other than any action above the waves was plain tedious and even annoying. With that said, I am not sorry to have rented this, I really loved the underwater footage, but I really wish I had waited until it was the 99 cent special, as it is obviously destined to be."
4,Halle fan,Movie was Ok - story was alright and kept moving - good movie to watch on DVD not necessarily a theater big seller
3,"Ok, worth 1 watch but not 2","Well, I love sharks, love the water, films set on the water & of course I love a seeing a beautiful babe such as HB.The movie was worth watching once, but prob not a movie I would watch again.HB looks great as usual. The 'scenery' was quite nice. Love the fact they used REAL GREAT WHITES & not some weird fake looking sharks & we see plenty of them. The best part was seeing the real great whites 'breaching' (flying up out of the water & in to the air while hunting their prey).But the movie itself was just sort of bla.So, I gave it 3 stars in trying to be halfway fair. It wasnt horrible & was worth a single viewing & I listed the 'good' above, but again, aside from what I listed it was just bla so it garners 3 stars from me...2 may be a tad too low considering it did have some good stuff but 4 stars would be saying this was 'better then average', which in my opinion, it was not."
3,If you like Halle Berry then watch it.,Any movie where Halle Berry shows some skin is worth watching period. The great white shark footage was a bonus.Movie was ok for those two things only.
2,Poor effort,"While the star of the show looked very good, the movie itself was slow and predictable. I will put this one in storage."
3,Beautiful Cinematography,"Kate Mathieson (Halle Berry) is not afraid to get into the water with sharks. She has such a way with these deep sea species that she's been called `the shark whisperer'. After tragedy strikes, she stops taking tourists shark diving and her business starts failing. When she gets an offer to return to what she used to love, will she take it?I viewed this film because I haven't watched a movie with Halle Berry in a while. There are educational moments, so I now know some things about sharks I didn't know before. I liked that there were subtitles - that made the film more interesting somehow. Some parts were predictable, some parts made me flinch and there were times when I turned my eyes away. What I liked most was the scenery in and out of the water - beautiful cinematography."
1,Rip-off,"This is not a bad product, simply over priced for what it is and the $6.95 s&h charge added to the total which amounts to $17.95 for something worth $5.00 or $6.00 is nothing short of outrageous."
4,"A good book for 4th, 5th, and 6th graders.","I think it was a good book. It was sad, but had a happy ending. It was about a jewish girl, named Anna, who was in hiding for 2 years. Her parents won't tell her where they were over the World War Two. Anna is having a hard time adjusting. There is a lady, who Anna, thinks is a Nazi. The so called Nazi turns out to be nice."
2,Take a different road,"1st this is not science fiction. This book is about a Native American in the USA--No Aliens! No weird Alien ecology! That said.....I agree with the reviewer that said this book is like a car wreck that you can't look away from. Only in my case, I found the book extremely well written and greatly paced. It just made me sick inside. If reading graphic description of a child being tortured or killed is your idea of a good read then this book is for you. If not, I recommend not starting this book. Once you start this book, you won't be able to not look away. And, like the wreck on the highway, (the worse thing you can imagine, in my case worse than that), you will ask yourself, why the hell, you didn't pull over and take a different road?Don't do it, dude."
1,Boooooring,"This would probably work as a very short story, but even then the ending is very predictable. It tries to say something so hard it loses any value it would have."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"This book was like a car wreck, in a way, for its allure. I didn't want to finish it because I was afraid of what would happen in the end but I couldn't stop from reading it. It is a beautiful but frightening tale of man's inhumanity to man. Katsuk must do what he has to do and David must follow. David grows as an individual through the ""teachings"" of Katsuk and learns what it is to be alive. Ultimately a book that I will remember for the rest of my life."
4,Early Herbert is still great Herbert,"It is truly amazing to read some of Frank Herbert's early work. Soul Catcher is a search of the human soul in a wilderness setting with a Native American twist. It is a great read and keeps you wondering up til the very end...which is VERY shocking I might add. If you enjoy a good fictional human interest story this is a must. Not to mention that it was written by one of the greatest authors to ever grace the pages of the literary community. Try it, you might be pleasantly surprised. I know I was."
5,"One of the best ""historical series"" ever.","This is only one of the ""Angelique"" books in the series consisting or 9 or 10 books. It is an excellent series for women or teenage girls who like a good book without all of the trashy ""quick reading"" books and series out there, as well as we are now discovering, many men enjoy the series as well. Just a good old fashioned read. I have a couple of copies of each of the books, the last one I have is ""Angelique and the Ghosts"", there may have been one or more written after that title. I have the original paperbacks I bought in 1973, as a teenager myself, and find myself re-reading this series once every other year or so."
5,Angelique Returns to France from Her Mediterranean Adventure,"Following her escape from captivity in Sultan Mulai Ismael's harem (see ""Angelique in Barbary,"" also known as ""Angelique and the Sultan""), Angelique returns to France. Once again faced with becoming the mistress of King Louis XIV, Angelique leads a doomed rebellion against the royal forces occupying her home province. Forced to flee with a price on her, she goes into hiding with the Heugenots in La Rochelle. Eventually located and hunted by the police she decides that her only recourse is to flee France. This decision brings her once again face-to-face with a ghost from her past, the pirate Rescator. Again I hesitate to add detail to this review, because the fun for the reader is in the reading of this fine story. This book has been out of print for decades and would be an outstanding addition to anyone's collection."
1,The Secret Garden,"This is the most annoying book I have ever read. The informational text is regularly interrupted by an inane conversation between two people spending the day in the garden. The conversation sometimes starts mid-sentence, making it very difficult to follow the line of thought in the text. Moreover, the author tries to make the topic more interesting by waxing poetic and calling mites little cars. Actually, the information is interesting on its own. and his feeble attempts to be ""cute"" or ""special"" make this book very hard to read and difficult to believe. I really wish that he had told the stories in a straightforward fashion and added a bibliography so I could follow up. As it stands, it is just a bunch of unbelievable gibberish."
4,The Book Helped Me Figure Out The Kewl Moves OfTheCharacters,"I dont know why u think the game sux , maybe u guys suck , i love it its the best rpg ive ever played and its way better than that crappy game xenogears that everyone loves so much . the book shows u moves that u would love and it really helped me on boss's that gave me a migrane so u better leave off the rpg and dont make fun of it again!"
1,This Book rThis is a very bad guide to the game,THis is a sorry game to beguin with i never played uch a bad game and also this book dosent really help me out with the game this is a bad guide and I would advice for you to stay away from this guide
1,Game need no strategy guide,Who actually bought this?? The game was easy and really did not needed a strategy guide. There were no real puzzle to solve or real strategy needed to fight a boss.
5,This book shows everything!,"There is nothing wrong with the content of this book, and if you're looking for an easy way to get out of a sticky situation, this has just about every secret there is. :"
2,Poor design,"This hub has several rotten design features. First, it is extremely lightweight, and the weight of its own cord makes it tip on its back. Thus,you have to set something at least as heavy as a coffee mug on top of it. The USB ports in the back are in two pairs. Unfortunately, the ports in each pair are so close together that unless you have a super-flat USB plug, you cannot plug in two USB devices in a set, effectively making your four port hub a two port hub.It works okay, I really don't find a difference in speed from a cheaper port I had, and I don't care about the lights. I usually really like Belkin products, but this one is trying to fake us out with bells and whistles (or in this case, ports and lights)."
4,vacu vin stainless-steel pineapple easy slicer,"I am sorry I didn't know about this pineapple easy slicer before. I wouldlove to have known that there would have been perfect pineapple roundswith hole in the center, however, if the pineapple is not perfectly centered, that is that it does not tilt, you need to straighten it fromthe bottom so that it will sit straight up allowing the corer to cutstraight down creating perfect circles. We love it. Buy it."
5,great fresh pineapple,"I was skeptical when my friend got one, but once she showed me how it worked and I tasted the fresh pineapple, I was sold. I got one for myself and several others as gifts for friends. Really a must for anyone who likes fresh pineapple."
5,Works perfectly!,"The pineapple slicer works amazingly well. I cut through two pineapples in less than 3 minutes. Key to success is to get it set into the pineapple, then start twisting. When you get to the bottom of the pineapple, just pull up on the handle as though you are removing the cork from a wine bottle. It will have a slight vacuum about it, then pull right out. Very slick gadget."
1,TOO SMALL!,"While I thought this slicer would be great because it is stainless steel and would last longer, it was small and not great for slicing normal sized pineapples. The plastic version is about 4 inches on the bottom while the steel slicer is about 3 inches in diameter.I would not recommend purchasing this slicer because it will waste about 1/2 inch of the pineapple when slicing."
2,Not too thrilled,You need a strong grip to get this slicer to work well. It takes a lot of push to work it all the way through the whole pineapple.
4,Works. A bit wasteful and hard to clean.,"First, it works, is fun to use, and is a crowd pleaser. If you like slightly silly kitchen gadgets, this will do it for you.On the down side, you probably get more pineapple out of your pineapple by peeling it with a knife. This tool will often leave a fairly think rind with lots of good fruit still in it.Also the stainless steel version, at least, is a bit hard to clean. It is made of three riveted-together pieces of steel. It's well constructed, but there are cracks between the pieces that catch bits of pineapple fiber, which need to be picked out before you stick the thing in the dishwasher. I've never seen the plastic version and don't know if it has similar problems.But, hey, it is fun to use. Enough fun that we've been buying a lot more pineapples than we used to, which is a good thing."
3,pull too hard.,Need to reengineer this product. Does what it says but it ain't easy. This is probaly the last review I will do for awhile . Too much red ink when I type a review.
5,Pineapple slicer-greatest gadget ever!!!,I'm a gadget person. If I see something that could make life easier I buy it. Some work fine. Some work not so fine and some don't work at all. This pineapple slicer is one of the greatest tools I have ever bought. I took the advice of another review about a plastic slicer and went for the stainless. It's really fantastic. I have arthritis in both hands and using this slicer is a breeze. Much easier than opening a can and fresh is so much better.
1,I would give zero.,"They said it is Vacu Vin product, but I didn't see any trademark or logo or instruction, on the product web page, they use Vacu Vin pictures but shipped other poor quality good, I can tell from the handle to the joint part, all different, very bad steel with wiped joint, poor plastic head, I even can't not insert it in the metal part, damaged box with ""flagships"" logo on it, I don't know what it is."
4,Great Tool for my Kitchen,"I bought this product online after I saw it being sold at Williams Sonoma. This metal pineapple corer makes slicing and dicing pineapples easier than ever. When I use it at parties, people are always impressed with it. If you do not like your pineapple in rings or small diced squares, this product won't be good for you. You don't get the same big chunks you would cutting a pineapple traditionally. When finished, you do get a nice shell to serve more fruit out of and there is left over pineapple juice. The only downfall is that there is still a lot of edible fruit left on the edges of the remaining pineapple shell and it seems like a waste to me, so i usually end up going back and trying to salvage those remaining parts after I have successfully cored the pineapple. All in all, this saves you a lot of time and takes the headache away from traditionally slicing a pineapple."
4,Vac U Vin Pineapple Slicer,"We found this slicer to be very nice. The only drawback it left a lot of pineapple waste, did not get as much as I would like. The slicer makes one large coil, which then needed to be cut. Otherwise, it is a handy gadget to have."
3,Not an original Vacu Vin Pineapple Slicer,"The ad states it's a Vacu Vin pineapple slicer when in reality it is a similar product made by ""Flagship"". I contacted the seller and was given a refund. Both items work the same but if you want a genuine Vacu Vin pineapple slicer look elsewhere."
1,WRONG DELIVERY!!!!,"I ordered the item on the picture because of its ergonomic handle, but I got totally different thing.I think this is not correct.The item should be the same.This is what I got.http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004O0TJHC/ref=asc_df_B004O0TJHC2248672?tag=thefind0181318-20&creative;=395261&creativeASIN;=B004O0TJHC&linkCode;=asnThanks for this,Ante"
3,Works great - does not match the picture though,"The item works as described. However, the picture shows a black and stainless slicer, what was delivered was a stainless slicer with a puke green handle... just the image you need before eating. It looks like it is straight out of the seventies. Not a fan of the puke green color, but it does do the job."
5,slice those pineapples,This is a most useful tool. It cuts pineapple rings so easily. I am very satisfied and highly recommend it.
2,steel pineapple slicer,"I bought the stainless steel pineapple slicer because I had been given the plastic model. The plastic slicer did a very nice job, but I knew it wasn't going to last very long. However, for some reason the steel version is smaller than the plastic model, and as a result, the core often isn't completely cut out, resulting in some tough pieces attached to each slice. Also, since it doesn't slice as wide a diameter as the plastic model, I am forced to manually trim the pineapple that the cutter failed to remove from the outer skin, in order to reduce waste. However, the steel slicer cuts much easier than the plastic model because it's edge is much sharper. I am very disappointed with the steel model, especially since it costs 2 1/2 times as much as the plastic model."
4,Pineapple slicer,The slicer works just fine but where the blade is attached to the handle there is a small space that is very hard to clean. You have to use a pointed knife to remove the pieces of pineapple that get stuck there. I had a plastic slicer before where the cutting blade and the handle were one piece and very easy to clean.
5,Truly amazing,This little tool amazes me everytime I use it. Takes the core out and make great pinapple rings everytime. It slices in real easy no pressure needed. If you have trouble getting it out once it bottoms out just keep turning in the same direction and pull up at the same time it'll slide right out.... Dishwasher safe - Great kitcehn tool.
5,Love it!,"It's easy to use, and does exactly what it's supposed to do. I always felt that I was wasting a lot of pineapple when I cut it by hand; there is some waste with this tool, too, but no more than when cutting by hand, and it is a breeze to use."
5,ultimate pineapple slicer,"I read about this item in Reader's Digest. Since cutting a pineapple was always something I abhorred, I decided to try it. It works great! It does leave part of the fruit on the rind, but since pineapples are cheap and easily assessable here, it's worth the loss. As one review said, one can use the rind as decoration or to drink from."
2,Would not recommend,"Works ok with a pineapple that is not very ripe, Will juice it instead of cut it. When pulling out of the pineapple after cutting the handle comes off poor design. I would not recommend this product to my friends."
3,Compromise,"Passed on the plastic version for stainless steel. Button release mechanism already hung up, and actual pineapple meat retrieval much too small. Would not recommend for family use."
5,pleased,After you get used to keeping the knife in line with the core it works great. I am very happy with it.
5,PINEAPPLE CORER/SLICER,"LOVE THIS GADGET!!![ IT MAKES AN OTHERWISE MESSY JOB SO EASY, NEAT AND QUICK.[ASIN:B000GA53CO Vacu Vin Stainless Steel Pineapple Easy Slicer]]"
2,Wastes a lot of pineapple,I read some of the reviews before purchasing this item. I was considering the PC pineapple slicer but this one was cheaper. I don't like it at all! It works just fine but wastes a ton of the pineapple!
2,Be forewarned,"I used this once then gave it away. For entertaining, the rings make a nice presentation. But you can easily cut chunks to look appealing. For normal use, know that a thick layer remains in the pineapple shell. Also, plastic handle feels flimsy."
5,Solid State Microwave Amplifier Design,A very comprehensive book covering everything you need to know about solid state microwave amplifier desing. Ideal for beginners and experts alike. A handy reference tool and memory booster. If you interested in or working in microwave amplifier design then this is an invaluable book to have.
4,Entertaining and historically informed account,"A superior and engaging account of how progress in the physical sciences is intertwined with the development of music theory and the evolution of musical instruments. The conversational tone of the text is never dry, and is liberally sprinkled with illustrations. There is music, science and history a-plenty here. You do not have to be ""scientifically minded"" to derive a great deal of pleasure and edification from the book, it has definitely been thoughtfully shaped by a professional educator. I first read this in 1990 and return to it time and again for reference, only to find myself absorbed in re-reading sections. Obviously a labor of love, ""Measured Tones"" deserves a wide audience. I wish Prof Johnston had written more!"
1,A Lurking Disappointment,"Interested in the men who played the national game in 1908, I eagerly plunged into ""More Than Merkle."" What I found was a book filled with syntax errors, either of the author's creation or of the publisher, the University of Nebraska Press. While most of these errors were minor, many served as great distractions from the reading of the text. The biographies of the men involved in baseball at the turn of the century really turned into nothing more than a verbal recapitulation of the statistics found in the ""Baseball Encyclopedia"" or ""Total Baseball."" Finally, the author seemed intent in finding a new villain or a new victim, or maybe even a new mystery to the ending of the 1908 National League season. Much of his argument proves to be superficial, often trivial, and sometimes just plain nonsense. On the positive side, the book does also examine the American League race of 1908, something that is often lost in the wake of the Merkle incident."
4,2 part means 2 different labels,"I was looking for a dymo lablel that was long and found this and didnt know what 2-part meant - it means that if you use this template with your dymo software it will print on 2 different labels. I think the overall label is 7 1/2"" long but that actually means that one label is around 5"" inches long and the other label is 2 1/2"" long."
3,Be careful choosing your postage provider,"I bought two rolls of these labels because PayPal and ebay said that they supported the labels. After trying to do this, I found out that while they say they support these labels, the software doesn't work, so you end up with useless labels."
5,An appealing relief from Hollywood junk,"This is a film about the friendship that develops between two lonely bachelors in 1950s rural Norway. One is a reseacher assigned to study the kitchen habits (why, I don't know) of Norwegian bachelor farmers. He is not supposed to talk or communicate in any way with his subject, the farmer, but eventually he does and thus begins the friendship.The movie is full of subtle humor (the premise of studying kitchen habits is rather silly to begin with) and proceeds at a peaceful pace that allows the humor to (I can't think of a better word) resonate. There are a couple of memorable images (one is a shot of a wet horse) and a few of the Norwegian countryside.You will probably like this film if you are insulted by most Hollywood productions (as I am.) No tough guys with guns, no T&A;, no exaggerated facial expressions: just a story about a sane friendship with a very unpredictable ending."
4,GCi404 audio interface,This is an decent product. It works as it says it does but the manual leaves something to be desired. Definitely not top of the line but it will perform the basic tasks that an AI does. One thing that I enjoy it sits in the cd bay but am unable to get to the back knobs unless I remove the side.
3,Only one per order,"These liftgate arms are fine, picture perfect replacements.However most sites sell these in pairs; it is strongly recommended by this manufacturer and others that both be replaced at the same time.The cost at many places for a pair is equal to the cost of a single lift here, so it's easy to assume that this amazon item is a pair of liftgate arms. However it's not. You get one single liftgate arm for twice the price. So pull your wallet out and get two if ordering from here.So 3 stars for OK quality, minus 1 stars for selling in a quantity not recommended for use by the manufacturer, and minus 1 star for costing twice as much per liftgate arm."
4,Good quality,"This product is high in quality, but is much bigger than I expected since it's listed as a small. I've kept it and am using it -- it's just larger than I expected."
2,crappy item,"well i got this i noticed that a battery was missing and it seems like just a piece of junk but i cant even tell because it doesn't even work right now and the batteries probably wont even last that long and i cant afford to keep buying them, another thing i was supposed to get a cord so i could plug it into my computer, i never got that either... so its a cheap piece of crap but im hoping it works the way i need it to."
5,Best XM Antenna Option,"Great product. I have one in my '01 Pathfinder, mounted on the rear left glass. Although it is bigger than you think it is from the picture, it doesn't have an ugly appearance like the ""dog tick"" antennas. It comes with a simple mounting template and you just peel & stick. No problem with the adhesive.Just be careful you mount it on flat surface. My installer mounted mine on a curved surface, and after several months water leaked in and ruined it. Terk replaced it free. I put the replacement in the same position, but ran a small bead of silicon around it to keep it dry.Highly recommended for auto XM installations."
5,A Delightful and Compelling Read,"The author clearly did a great deal of research on a broad array of interesting topics. The trenchant and witty manner in which the book is written makes for a decidedly compelling read.In addition to the standard reference sources, the author also includes many websites for those who wish to obtain additional information on the topics covered.In sum, I recommend highly this book and hope that the author writes another of this genre. Bravo!"
4,"Gorgeous soundscape, low on the songwriting.","I suppose it's an empty critique to say that the album does not showcase much strength in songwriting. Yet the album was the collaberation of 19 established vocalists (e.g. Cat Power, Robert Wyatt who is also featured on the new Bjork album ""Medulla"", and Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth), none of whom are working with their own lyrics but are converting the poetry of George Seferis to music.The poetry is gorgeous, no doubt. The music itself matches and maybe excells Seferis' kaikus. Ranging from light acoustic experimentation to what borders on trance, the album is musically varied and stunning. It's amorphous in it's form and has little in the sense of forward motion or climax, but works tremendously well in it's soundscape and emotive atmosphere. In many ways, the work sounds like the product of a marraige between Miles Davis and Sigur Ros, with the occasional passionate affair with Bjork.I like."
1,I thought editors actually edited...,We purchased this book for our daughter who needed to learn about someone who had done heroic things. I scanned the book so that I could review her report for accuracy. There are a couple of pages in which the chronology of Mother Teresa's life and that of WWII gets quite mixed up! I find that inexcusable.
5,God came here,"This is a testament of everything that is good, great, heroic, of our country and God.These POW's are saints and patriots. I am proud to call them my inspiration.GBU, flyer!"
2,so many movies like this,there are so many movies like this....movies which showed the american hardships during the war. every movie blames the vietnamese as being evil. particularly this one. in every war....there are people who suffer.....and people who do the suffering. vietnamese people suffered in the war too...even more so than the americans. every vietnamese was affected with the war. lets not forget the my lai massacre and countless other incidents. both sides were to blame...not just the vietnamese. and because of that i dont give this movie a high rating.
5,Excellent product & fast service,"A disturbing and eye-opening movie based on true events. It was hard to see the brutal torture experienced by our men. At the same time, it made me think of our own Guantanamo Bay prison, and made me wonder what kinds of torture we may have used to extract information from our POW's. We see the Vietnamese as being vicious in their treatment of our people, but of course, their people were being killed by our armed forces. They would want to retaliate. It seemed to me that the men looked awfully healthy and well fed when the time came for their liberation, and I wonder how that compares with the reality. All in all it was an excellent movie and I highly recommend it.Philip Stel"
5,Great value for the price,"I was actually just looking for ""Where Eagles Dare"", but found this to be better value for the money. Four classic war movies at this price, just great !"
2,Without recommendation,"I cannot recommend this four movie set, which I purchased solely to receive ""The Big Red One"". This flick is one of World War II's most memorable, but not in this set. The DIRECTOR'S CUT of ""The Big Red One"" is available on amazon for $7.07; a full three hours long. The DIRECTOR'S CUT is memorable and worth having.""Where Eagles Dare"" is unbelievable; almost ridiculous. Kids might enjoy it.""Kelly's Heroes"" is more of a comedy set in the European war theater. As a comedy it is okay.""Hanoi Hilton"" is a film with real actors but done as a documentary. It is not entertaining."
2,No chapter index - bummer!,"I bought this DVD because, many years ago, I worked on this film. I've had the VHS tape for a long time but, because I use the film in teaching a class, I bought the DVD, hoping that I could access certain scenes quicker than winding and rewinding a video tape. I was wrong - there is not chapter index so, if you want to cue up to a particular scene, you have to hit the Forward Button on the remote to get it ""kind of sort of"" where you want it. So, I now am going to use both the DVD and the VHS tape for the two scenes I need."
1,Disappointed,"I received my DVD in less time than expected, but was disappointed that it was a re-make. I'd seen a black and white version several years ago, and feel it had so much more drama. I can't blame the seller for this...........he did fine. But I really would like to get hold of the original someplace."
5,"Easy to use, good enough adhesion","I use these labels continuously for shipping Amazon Marketplace items. I never have any feed issues and the consistency of the paper and print are very consistent. The adhesive on these is very good and will permanently stick on packages, even on top of packaging tape. I would fully recommend this product for anyone wanting to print address labels as well as address labels with return & address on all one, or any other need for larger labels."
2,Cartridge faulty,"My problem is with Amazon, when you receive a faulty cartridge that doesn't work, there is no way to return it or get a free replacement for it, you're just stuck with it. I received 2 cartridges recently and both were bad and there's no way to get a refund or replacement."
3,Necessary for CatGenie,"This product is great for what it does - clean the CatGenie, however the price just jumped by 30% - both on Amazon and on the CatGenie.com site. The price increase makes the whole system less appealing - especially considering one of CatGenie's major selling points is supposed to be: never buy litter again. You may not be spending it on litter but you're still spending it on the box."
2,Emptied as soon as installed,There must be something wrong with the cartridge...it completely emptied as soon as I put it in. Maybe it is a re-manufactured one. Did arrive quickly and price was reasonable until it was all used up at once.
1,Wrong cartridge,The Cat's out of solution and the cartridge did not work. Turns out they have two different cat genies and cartridges. They look exactly alike. How Stupid Amazon will not accept returns. How Stupid. The Cat's mad.
2,Pricey and a waste,"You would think that a product that was ""Enviromentally Friendly"" would come in recyclable packaging, but it does not. The actual clear packing plasic is not marked for recycling and neither is the cartridge.It would also only be 2/3rds empty and it would be ""EMPTY"" and there was still a LOT of solution left in it! With 3 cats, we'd go through 2 cartidges in one week! Wasn't worth it anymore!I'm selling my CatGenie on Ebay."
4,Love the Cat Genie - be frugal with the accessories,"Love my cat genie as it has revolutionized by pet care, however keep in mind all of the accessories are expensive. Sanisolutions, Granules, etc - that adds up. Shop around! I first bought the single sani solutions, then realized that they are also sold on Amazon in 3, 6 and 12 packs!Sani-Solution Smart Cartridge, Unscented (6-Pack)"
5,Everything about it is true. Belive it!,This is a marvelous product that performs exactly as presented. I have had it for several months now and it has never malfunctioned. Have even done the complete cleaning process with no hassles. Customer support is first rate. It ain't cheap but it is the best solution and worth every penny.
5,I am Happy and so is my Cat,This is a great product along with my CatGenie. I love it and so does my cat.
3,NOT for the Cat Genie 120!,"The description mentions the 120 a couple times but this will not work with the Cat Genie 120. Also, it's classified ""hazardous material"" so you can not return it to Amazon."
4,Nice Frame,I love this frame and have several of them. It looks great mixed in with some of the standard black w/white mat frames I have in our display. Just make sure your picture doesn't completely clash with your wall color. You do have to use some acid free double-sided tape to stick the picture to the back piece of glass or it can sometimes slip down. The frame itself does not seem to provide enough pressure to hold the picture in place forever.
2,Power Yoga with Rodney Yee,"I tried the series hoping it would be fun for a beginner. I found it too rigorous ""flowing"" from one position to the next a little bit too often to ensure proper posturing for me. Thanks, but no thanks. I want to feel centered and revitalized after a yoga session - not Jane Fonda exhausted. I'm sure some instructor somwhere loves it. I'm an average size 16 and it just moved too fast for me, after one year of yoga experience."
3,"Like Reviewer: Johnny from Plano, TX said!","""The timing between Yee's visual and audio cues are inconsistent, i.e., sometimes his movements are ahead of his words, other times behind. This is not a big deal if you always follow Yee on the screen but becomes a big deal if you mostly listen. While most of his movements are slightly behind his audio cues, Yee does move ahead of his own words on multiple occasions.""This video is too difficult for a beginner....you need to already know the poses."
4,good,I am new to yoga and I liked the faster pace of this tape. After 2 times I had the moves down! This program is for the go-getter! I would not recommend for the severely out of shape or overweight person.
4,Love Rodney,"I love Rodney Yee yoga videos. The scenery is great. His voice is soothing. He doesn't talk too much. The music is good. The only thing that surprised me is that when I first bought this yoga routine years ago on VHS, I found it strenuous. Now, after doing so much yoga, this routine seemed easy to me. I still like this DVD because it's Rodney. But, I won't do this video when I want a vigorous yoga workout. I'll do this one for a light yoga routine."
3,As Advertised - But Not Right for Me,"Many other reviewers complained that Yee's pace was too quick. I thought I knew enough about yoga to keep up so I ordered it. But all those reviewers were right. I do not have the flexibility to change positions as quickly as he does. While I don't have to watch the TV screen (I know what position he is going to when he says the position's name), most of the time I end up scrambling around very un-yoga-ically (apologies for the bad grammar) to get into the next position. By that time he's on the third one. Only get this if you are VERY fit and VERY limber and you know your poses."
3,does not live up to its potential,"Although the three half hour routines were pretty good, I was disappointed that the ""complete workout"" was just the three of them strung together. Since each half hour takes you from warm up to relaxation, they do not go together very well.This DVD is good for a quick workout, but not really usable as something that'll make you break a sweat."
4,yoga-at-home,"This is really one of my favourite workout dvds, but it's NOT for beginners. I would not recommend this tape to anyone who is not already familiar with downward facing dog, upward facing dog, and triangle poses -- you will just hurt yourself or get discouraged because Yee does not provide much instruction or modification for a safe practice. He does give good cueing though, if you already know the poses. I've had the dvd for over a year and feel that I am just now mastering the first practice after practicing almost every day. Yee has put together sequences that are sufficiently challenging to keep your interest and encourage you to keep improving. There is enough on this dvd to keep you busy for a long time. The flow between the sequences is quite fast so I memorized the first practice and often do it in a slower form. My one complaint is that he often stays longer on one side than on the other, which is annoying because you have to stop the dvd or try to catch up somehow."
5,Nice alternative to weights,"After badly injuring one of my shoulders doing the bench press, I had to find a safer alternative to weightlifting. So I decided to look into yoga. Rodney Yee was about the only guy who caught my interest. I have a number of his tapes, but this dvd is the main one I've used over the years. The workouts are challenging and will make you sweat. Some of the poses in the strength section are particularly difficult, but I was able to eventually do them all with practice. Of course, you prolly won't look as good as Rodney Yee doing the poses, but if you're able to get your feet up off the ground that's the main thing in my book! I've always enjoyed the strength section the most as it focuses on arm strength and is quick to the point. All in all, I really have enjoyed the DVD and Yee's workout is definitely a nice alternative to lifting weights for hours on end and chugging protein shakes. And if nothing else girls love a guy that does yoga. ;)"
2,NOT for beginners,"The DVD says it is for beginners, but Rodney goes WAY too fast for anyone who isn't well versed in the poses to follow. Do not get this DVD unless you are already familiar with all the poses, it will not teach them to you."
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"I'm a beginner in yoga, I've taken a few classes and followed a few videos. I bought this DVD by mistake cause I did not know what power yoga was. Power Yoga is a type of Yoga that moves through the poses at an accelerated pace, which makes it difficult for beginners to follow.I've also read a lot of reviews that Rodney Yee seems to move into poses before he explains them or indicates that he is going to do them, I agree with these reviews.One last point, I actually find his voice kind of irritating, which is frustrating, cause he's such a beautiful man. If you've got the dvd and you notice the way he says ""exxxhale..."" then you know what I mean.Maybe if you're really good at yoga and are used to power yoga and rodney yee's voice, then this dvd is alright for you. but it's NOT FOR BEGINNNERS!"
3,So so for Beginners,"I am an advanced beginner and has been taking yoga lessons at the local gym and doing yoga to videotapes for the last 3 months. I found the DVD a bit disappointing since to me, it was not very challenging, particularly compared to the Power Yoga classes and DVDs I've seen and practiced. In comparison, Rodney went through the motion far too quickly (for my taste) and I hardly broke a sweat when doing his routine. I also found it disconcerting that what he narrates might not be what he is doing at the same time. However, once you get used to the routine, I just listened to him and rather than watch his positions. Lastly, some of the positions are also way difficult for beginners (for which I assume this DVD is). The cinematography in this DVD is great though. If you truly want a challenging power yoga workout and is advanced beginner/intermediate like me, I really enjoyed Bryan Kest's Power Yoga series."
5,Good power yoga video for beginners,"This is not the most challenging power yoga tape if you are already familiar with power yoga, but it is definitely good for those just starting. It's also really good for morning workouts or for long days when you're a bit less energetic and less flexible. As someone else said, the DVD format is wonderful for a quick 20 minute workout or for extending it up to an hour. Yee is such an awesome teacher--his form is great, his voice is calming, and he gives just the right amount of instruction. However, if you are new to yoga, I would not recommend this tape just yet. Begin instead with a tape like Yoga Journal's Practice for Beginners or Yoga Journal's Flexibility, Strength, and Relaxation (you can buy them in a set or individually). These will help you learn the poses correctly before jumping into this tape's more flowing rhythm."
3,Amazon's title is COMPLETELY WRONG,"Amazon list's the title of this DVD as ""Power Yoga for Beginners - Stamina, Strength, Flexibility with Rodney Yee"". This is not correct. The title of the DVD is ""Power Yoga - the complete workout."" Nowhere on the DVD package does it make a claim of being for beginners. The package says it is ""accessible to anyone with a familiarity of yoga and a moderate level of fitness.""Do not buy this DVD if you are looking for an introduction to Yoga. Don't be fooled by Amazon's misleading title."
2,Not challenging,What a terrible yoga workout. The person narrating the video was inconsistent with the poses. There really wasn't a challenge to this at all. It was a nice idea that you can choose to do three shorter workouts or one long one. I've been doing yoga for quite a while and this isn't a video I'd recommend to anyone.
2,Bought the wrong DVD,"If you are new to Yoga, this DVD will not help you. Everything goes by too quickly. Most of the really good beginner yoga videos are only on VHS for some reason. I hope this changes."
4,first time yoga,"First, just a word to A.Vegan. If you have been performing yoga for a while, why would you choose this DVD? It does say for beginners, so it doesn't surprise me that it wasn't challenging enough for you. Maybe you should try something with ""Power Yoga for Intermediate or Advanced Students"" instead? That being said, this is pretty tough for the beginner. Not really in a fatigue sort of way, more the flexibility and the familiarity with the routine. At first, you are constantly looking at the video at the same time as doing the moves, and like people have said, it isn't quite in sync all the time. After a few times through, however, you can follow the voice alone and just look up now and then to double-check. I have become addicted to Yoga through this DVD and my flexibility has improved as well as my sense of balance. I think this is a worthwhile DVD to purchase, along with other DVDs that complement it.Mike"
3,Very good but too fast for meditating,"I purchased this DVD to get in shape after massive back surgery. It worked. I agree with the reviewer that said, ""It kicked my butt"". When I purchased this DVD I had never been to a yoga class. Now that I've been to an hour-long class, these programs are too short. The three do not link together into one 1 1/2 work out, they just play one right after the other. I have to pause every pose if I'd like to hold it. I have a much harder time meditating because of the pace. The workouts ARE good and you WILL get in shape. But if you'd like to do some meditation or stress relief, they move too quickly."
2,Not for beginners,"I have taken about 10 or so beginner yoga classes and this tape is not for beginners. It moves so quickly that if you have never done yoga before you will not be able to follow Rodney's moves. It requires basic knowledge of yoga postures and Rodney only holds them for a second or two. He does not explain them in detail. If you are a yoga regular and you prefer to move rapidly through postures, this video is for you, otherwise try something slower."
3,Kindle Price Set Wrong,"Pardon me if this is fixed by the time you read this review, but this Kindle edition is priced at $47.96 right now. You can get a used paperback of it for 39 cents plus shipping. What is wrong with this picture?"
1,Useless,Moths don't care about these. Putting up with the smell isn't worth the money you will spend on this garbage.
4,Pleasing Smell,"I'm not sure yet of the effectiveness but the smell is very pleasant. Easy to use and,hopefully, it will repel damaging bugs."
2,Same footage,"Don't get me wrong I like TAPS. I like the crew, the quality and the stories. However you don't need to buy this particular DVD to get the stories. These are copied stories of season 1 & 2. I bought Season 1,2, and part of three as well as this one at the same time. I figured it would have additional features, added stories and commentary. It didn't just the same stuff. Keep your money and just buy the seasons you won't miss anything."
5,Best Paranormal Show,This show is by far the best paranormal reality show! They are great! It is very informational and you are always waiting to see what is going to happen next! It is highly recommended! Tune in to SCI FI Wednesday at 9....new season is going to be continuted sometime this month! IT is great!
5,The Dead Don't Dance,"As far as I am concerned Charles Martin does not write a bad read - or at least I have not found one. This story is true of most of his writings being set in a small town or countryside near a small town and full of ""good neighbors"" throughout the story. They all have a strong Christian theme and beautiful love stories filled with the angst of living. He does a tremendous amount of research into the area featured and the occupation or hobbies of the main characters so that the reader feels they really know these people and can see them in the setting."
3,Eighhhh It's okay,This book was definitely a lot slower and more painful to read than When Crickets Cry. I am not sure why it was so drawn out but I guess I was glad I read it.
5,Amazing Story!,Charles Martin is an exceptional writer! I could hardly put the book down! I highly recommend all of Charles Martin's book!
5,A good read.,"From the time I picked up this book, I was transported into the main character's world. Begining in the middle of Dylan's tumulultous trial-his wife in a coma and his first child still born-the author weaves a beautiful tale of sorrow, hope, spirituality, and triumph over one's darkest moments. With beautiful settings and heartfelt memories, this is a tale that will inspire for generations! Original story and characters. I give this two thumbs up!"
5,Where have you been all my life!??,I positively loved this book! A great story all the way through. There is just nothing bad to say about this writer. I liked it so well that I bought all that he had out which was 4 at this time. I'm anxiously waiting the next one! I generally get my books from the library but this one is one to share with all my friends and relatives and then keep.
5,Great Story,Don't buy one without the sequel. You will want to keep reading! Both THE DEAD DON'T DANCE AND MAGGIE are wonderful. Charles Martin has a gift for writing not common in the literary world.
5,Excellent Author,"This book was awesome, it brought me to tears and it held my attention all the way through to the end."
2,I've read better...I guess it's not my style,I was really looking forward to reading this book. There were a lot of 5 star reviews on it. The plot and the idea behind it seemed good. But I didn't really get his writing style. He uses lots of similes. I didn't have time to picture what he was talking about before he told me exactly what it looked like. It was also very predictable. But the most frustrating thing was...many of the rising actions throughout the book that I thought were meaningful later were hardly mentioned and not given much justice. Then on the opposite end of the spectrum things that I didn't realize mattered were substantial to the character's well being. I just never felt envolved and quite frankly didn't get it.
3,Pretty good,"I thought this book was good but a little predictable, and a little odd in spots. A dog in a hospital, and spelling trees and flowers in the hospital from outside? Just a few off things that created pet peeves for me, but overall the story was engrossing and Maggie a character I rooted for."
1,Not worth the money!,"This was such a disappointing movie. The previews made it seem like it would be great--starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Peter Facinelli and Matthew Lillard. All three of them had been in movies I loved before like Can't Hardly Wait. But this was a very disappointing movie.First the majority of the movie takes place in a pizza parlor where Dash and Facinelli work. It is mostly about life after school where some people are going off to make the most of their lives and these guys are working in a slow pizza place. Hewitt is by no means the star or even a major role in this movie--she palys an obnoxious girl and is on screen for a total of less than 15 mintues. A total waste. And Lillard plays his usual role as a hotshot, but like Hewitt, has his talent completely wasted in this film.I was so disapointed in this movie. I expected more from a cast that had produced other great movies in the past. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this movie."
3,Kinda slow,"This movie is not fast paced at all, good for drinking and a pizza. fun night at the mates house. But you can't go past the gorgeous jennifer. WoW!!"
2,I'm telling you this movie sucks!,Take a group of college graduates - 2 of them work at a pizza place. They lose $1100 of their bosses money....panic what should we do? lets throw a party...the end! The cast is really good but they are wasted on a the story. The story may seem OK but there are too many long pointless conversations and boring moments which left me reaching for the ff button on my remote. Theres nothing really going on in the movie...if there is it takes forever to get going.If you're a hard core Jennifer Love Hewitt or Peter Facinelli fan then this will be bearable...if not just catch it on tv!
2,I WANT A REFUND!,i give this movie 2 stars because it would be downright cruel to give it anything less... i think that it was hyped up way too much for what it really turned out to be. they used big stars like jenifer and matthew on their poster when the probably had a combined total of 15 minutes screen time.. it really was just a huge dissapointment to me finding out i wasted 13 bucks buying 15 minutes of my fave. stars.
1,SHOULD BE ILLEAGAL TO SELL!,"This movie was auwful. The commercials for it on She's All That made it look like the next movie in line for a teen Oscar...so I went to Blockbuster and got it right? I had such high expectations so I kept waiting for it to get good. IT NEVER DID! What was the point of this movie? Umm- a story about a JEALOUS lover in the beginning- a physcho stalker (JHL Who acted well as her part- Love, I commend you) and then some money gets takin by a homeless guy. Well great movie!...not THIS MOVIE STINKS!"
2,missed a good chance,"The director should take the blame on this one. Obviously somehow he got his hands on a good script with fairly amusing dialogue, cast good actors who were able to keep it floating most of the time (particularly when the director himself isn't in the scene), but the actores are left alone out there. There's no pacing, no mind behind the telling of the story. Looks like a vanity production for the little director guy who dropped himself in scenes. What happened? Couldn't get cast in a project with someone else's money on the line? Stay away from the biz, director. If another co-writer ever takes you on again, be thankful."
4,"Well, it was good!!","The only thing I didn't like about this awesome movie is that stupid guy who showed up twice in the movie. He's tall(just to describe, not that tall means anything) and he can't act worth beans. He made the movie worse in those appearences, luckily, it was only twice and that's what saved the movie. That, and JLH was absolutely amazing!! She was the best! 4 stars for her, and none for the movie! Plotwise, well this movie didn't have a strong plot, but was pretty funny! LIke when JLH falls off her bed answering the phone! The other actors weren't so good, especially the main actor! But this movie was good enough, mostly JLH, but what can you do, not much, see this, it's worth it!!"
4,Lots of Options,"This is a very easy to decorate cake. I put it on a sheet cake, half green (grass) and half blue (sky) for a house warming party. I have also turned it into a church, for Easter."
5,Good Product,"This is a great product for any haunted house, barn house, any kind of house cake you may have to make. I have used this pan many of times and it works great each time! Don't overfill!"
1,Not Very Good,You have to buy a specific brand of supplies to duplicate work. DVD is genericused in many other books.
5,Scoop,"Since I already owned the same ice cream scoop, and was very pleased with it, I knew it would make a good gift for anyone."
5,Grandma says it's the best,I gave this to my arthritic Grandmother after trying her old plastic scoop. She doesn't have a strong grip and likes to eat ice cream every day! She liked it so much she insisted on including it in her gift for both bridal showers she attended this summer. High praise!
3,Too big,"This scoop has a very clever design, but the ""wings"" are so far apart that the scoop becomes somewhat unwieldy. It creates huge scoops, and as a result isn't very practical unless you're scooping from a gallon drum of ice cream. It would be much more handy if it was smaller. Also, if the ice cream is really hard, I don't see much advantage to using this scoop - you're going to struggle just as with a ""regular"" scoop."
2,Stainless Steel?,"If the scoop that I received is stainless steel, then it's chrome plated stainless steel.... and what's the point of that? From the first I thought it looked chromed, but it worked so well that I kept using it. Then after less than 3 months the top layer began to pit after soaking in water, which is precisely what I bought stainless steel to avoid.I would give it 5 stars if it weren't chromed. It works great, especially with the standard round ice cream container.Well, too bad. And too bad that it's too late to return it.If you do get one then keep it clean, dry, don't let it soak, and you should be fine.LATER NOTE: Nothing in the description states that this is stainless steel: It's Amazon's search & in-house description that does: ""Wilton / Copco Ice Cream Scoop - Stainless Steel ""."
4,"Am I color-blind, or...?","It's a great scoop, no question about that. The only issue I have is that I ordered the one with black accents, not the one with orange accents, which I received. While my daughter loves orange, I usually prefer to get the item I actually order."
5,Great scoop - but overpriced at Amazon,"I stumbled on this icecream scoop at a store called Kitchen Collections. They sell it there for 6 bucks! The design is similar to Kenmore but this one has a rubber backside whereas Kenmore is hard plastic. They're both sold for the same price so I'm glad I got this one. I wash it in the dishwasher all the time, no issues! It scoops up really hard icecream. My husband and I love it!"
1,Bait and Switch,"When I read the review about the poor guy who got the fake scoop, I figured he was just an unlucky dude. I was really impressed with the looks of the one I received. The problem is that the scoop is not stainless and built in China. It may work real well but I am not going to buy a lie. Take the ""Stainless Steel"" off the description! I bought this one because I already broke my other China scoop in half. I sent it back immediately when I determined it was a great looking fake. At least Amazon made the return very easy and covered the shipping costs."
1,this is not the wilton scoop as shown,the scoops I received were Copco chrome versions of this scoop - not the stainless wilton version that is shown in the picture.You cannot was them in the dishwasher without dimpling and ruining the finish.very disappointed!!!!
5,You will never buy another ice cream scooper,"I have owned many other ice cream scoopers before picking this one one. I always had the same problem with the other ice cream scoopers. Basically I can scoop out ice cream easily when it is a freshly open container of ice cream. After the ice cream has been opened up and not so soft anymore, then it is a battle to scoop it out. I recently picked up the Wilton ice cream scooper (I have many other products made by the company and love them all). Anyhow, this is hands down, by far, the best ice cream scooper I have ever owned in my life time. The corners of this scooper cuts into the ice cream, making scooping out ice cream so easy (even if it is not freshly open soft ice cream)! I am even able to get the same size scoop ice cream out each time, I am very impressed by the design of this ice cream scoop."
2,not what I ordered,"I ordered a Wilton ice cream scoop and received an off-brand made in China one that is not stainless steel. It's the same design as the Wilton one I used to own and loved. There is a Wilton copyright on the back of the card so I guess this company bought the design from Wilton. I'm still not happy. Too much trouble to send it back but I feel cheated. The Wilton one comes with the rubber grips in bright, cheerful colors and this one is black.I do not appreciate the brand switch. I expect better from Amazon."
5,Panasonic EW3152A Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor,Was looking for a home tester similar in operation to the big testers found in super markets ect. and this machine is it. It is fully automatic with a large screen that is easy to read and operate. The ability to test several times during the day at home has resulted in a prescription that better controls my pressure on a twenty four hour basis. It adapts to virtually any size arm and in less than a minute you have a result. For anyone interested in monitoring blood pressure in an attempt to get the most effective medication for his or her situation I can definately reccommend this machine.
2,"Returned because got more ""error"" messages than readings","I do not recommend this product. While it's a wonderful design and would be very much easier to use than my current pump up one. It gives more error messages with the readings than readings. I was VERY disappointed.Amazon made the return very easy, and I appreciated that but the product is a definate PASS."
2,I returned it,It works ok when u get it to work.It's too big and hard to make it in the right position unless you have the special desk to setup for it.
3,It is what it is.,"This rack works well, but I have trouble getting both holes to line up with the screw hole sin my gator rack. Still, its an elegant solution for small stages and even around the house, holds my basses securely, and looks pro."
5,well worth the money!,"The second season is great! I'm buying my copy of Part 2 today! Many episodes have evidence of paranormal occurances, and the episodes that don't are still very entertaining. I highly recommend this to fans of the show and curious skeptics (this series will make you a believer;) )."
5,"Ghosthunter Season 2,Part 1","Again this was a gift and 95% of the things I buy from Amazon is for gifts because Amazon has everything you could ever look for in most retail stores all under one website and its so easy to purchase from Amazon. I have never, ever had any complaints on the gifts chosen from Amazon and I will continue to be a repeat customer over and over and OVER again."
2,"Great show, but DVD quality is poor, especially audio","I love Ghost Hunters, but the quality of the audio/video encoding for these DVDs is very poor. The audio is overloaded and 'clips'. People's voices have a tinny quality and it's very annoying. How could Big Vision Entertainment have let this get by to release?Bottom line: Video quality is barely acceptable, but audio is just unacceptable for a professional DVD release. I think Big Vision should re-release this with corrected audio and replace them."
3,Great show--poor quality DVD,I thought I was the only one with a bad quality DVD. I love this series but the DVD quality is just horrible. What is the deal? It's almost a challenge to listen to the audio at times--and I have episodes from Season 1 that won't even play and I just have to skip them. I took one of the sets back to Best Buy thinking I just got a bad copy but the replacement is no better. Hope they can improve on this because this is a great TV show.
2,ghost hunters DVD,We love ghost hunters but you at amazon are sending people the defective discs. their video company has produced new ones to replace the first ones made. on the originals the audio is messed up.
4,Horrible audio problem corrected,"I'm a Ghost Hunters fan and watch every week. The Season 2 parts 1 & 2 DVDs are really good, content-wise but the original versions have abysmal audio.Big Vision Entertainment just released ""new"" versions in Sept 2007 with the audio problem remedied. Owners of the copies with the bad audio can send in the paper wrap that covers each DVD set to them and they will replace the set for free. I just received my exchanged copies a couple of weeks ago.Look up their website and call them for specifics, if you have any questions.Hopefully newly ordered DVDs will be from the improved stock, but if not you can exchange them through Big Vision Entertainment directly."
5,"Dont let Amazon fool you, This is not the complete season 2","Ghost Hunters is a great show, and I love Amazon, but I must warn you that this is NOT the complete season 2 nor do they have the complete season 3, so if you buy the on demand versions of these seasons you will not have all the episodes, I would recommend just buying the dvds.Season 4 however is all there except for the live Halloween special."
3,Great show but...,"I'll be blunt - I love the series but the DVD Seasons 2, Part 1 and part 2 have a grainy video quality about them and the sound is just so horrible I was having a hard time comprehending some of the investigators. This is a major disappointment. Why should fans have to settle with poorly translated DVD's?Re-release something that is above VHS/Beta quality."
1,Horrific,"The video and sound are more frightening than anything seen on ghost hunters. It sounds like I'm playing the dvd and listening through a walkie talkie (its that bad!). This company hasn't taken the steps to correct the issue properly even if people have claimed they have. Why GH or Sci Fi or whoever signed on with this company in the first place I have no idea. I wish a quality company would have access to release dvds for this tv show. Simply sad, do not buy these as you will be dissapointed."
3,Can't say I didn't know it!,"Well, I've read a bunch of reviews on this prior to purchasing, and I've seen all the complaints about the video quality, so I can't say I didn't know. I was just hoping it wasn't as bad as all that.Well, it is.I mean, this is ""Ghosthunters"", my favorite TV show, so I was gonna buy it anyway, however, that still doesn't change the fact that the video quality is downright crappy. It's a shame, because a show of this caliber deserves better. That is why I only gave it three stars instead of five.I hope the subsequent volumes are better."
3,Audio Quality very poor!,As with the other part of Season 2 the audio quality of the dvds was very poor. The cases were also poor with one spindal on the inside for all 4 dvds. The only way I can be made happy is to get these replaced with high quality replacements but I won't hold my breath.
5,"Ghost Hunters - Season 2, Part 1","As in my previous review of the other DVD I bought of Ghost Hunters, great fan, will continue buying their seasons and probably will watch them over and over again. Great TV Show, glad they are out on DVDs."
5,Ghost Hunters,"Great DVD. I reccomend any of their dvd's. I had the honor of ghost hunting with Jason and Grant on the Queen Mary (a non televised ghost hunter retreat). These guys are exactly the same in person as they appear on TV. They are genuine, honest, nice guys. They are the best at what they do! I hope they continue ghost hunting for a very long time."
3,"Great Show, Horrible sound and video quality.","Many have already said it, but I'll say it again. This is one of the best shows on T.V. So why the crappy video and sound quality. The audio in particular is horrible. It reminds me of what it sounds like when you talk to close to a microphone. And the video is very choppy and the colors vary. Watching the show on the SciFi channel is ten times better than this DVD. I have never complained about DVD quality before, but this is so bad that it is actually a distraction. I don't want people to not buy the dvd, but you might be better off getting the itunes version."
1,Ghost Hunters dvd are poor quality items,"Having experience numerous freeze and skip issues with season one, I was very disappointed to find that season 2, parts 1 and 2 had such atrocious audio problems as well as two disk 6's and no disk 7.I fired off a very sarcastic email to Big Vision Entertainment and was extremely surprised to receive a gracious response from their Vice President offering to replace the sets via Fed Ex, which I accepted.The replacement sets never arrived and my subsequent emails were ignored.The moral of the story is that Big Vision produces a bad product. They fooled me twice, but will not do so a third time.Buy their product at your own risk."
1,STAY AWAY,What ever you do stay away from this video. The sound quality is D- and the video quality is F. I love this show and never miss an episode and could not wait for the dvd to come out. BOY was I DISAPPOINTED. I spent my hard earned money on a dvd that is so dark you can not even see most of the evedince. And the sound is all mumbled and static beyond belief. Supposedly the company that produced these are going to come out with a cleaned up version (sometime). So far it has been almost a year and nothing.
4,Great Series,"This is a great series, if you are a fan of ghost hunting this is probably the best show out there. The only thing I was dissapointed about was the DVD case and this seems to be a manufacturing problem with the company who handles the GH series on DVD. The DVD's were all loose in the case and the center piece (its supposed to lock them in place) was broken. This is now the second time this has happened with brand new DVD's in this series. With that said my family has been having a lot of fun watching the first few episodes of season 2. A must have for GH fans."
2,An Incomplete Order,"It is quite aggravating to get 3 of the 4 discs (actually, I did get 4, but got 2 of the #2 disc). I hope Amazon doesn't expect me to pay and download the episodes I have missed."
1,Should be only on TV,I was disappointed to see more personal/business issues as ghost/haunting issues. I am living overseas and never saw any of the original broadcasts. Truly disappointed.
3,Nothing new or interesting,There was nothing exciting about the pictures or the writeup. Nothing new...same old same old.
5,"It's good, but watch out for move 43",My girlfriend did not like that one! Ho ho ho boy let me tell you...
3,Good but. . .,"This book has some very interesting photography and some good basic positions as well as a few more creative ones. I liek some of the writing along with the positions and very clear directions about where body parts go. There is nothing too ridiculous that I don't think most couples could physically actually do. Though, I will say that both my partner and I are physically fit, one being a dancer and the other an athelete, so take my perception with that in mind.The only criticism I would have is on the models. I am in a bi-racial relationship and found it hard to relate to the models. They are all beautiful, but they all look the same to me. If you appreciate models who represent more different types of people, this isn't the book for you. Or use a companion piece with this one. The photography is stunning sometimes though.It is worth a look."
4,Lots of good info,"I'm new to Bonsai, and this is one of my first books on the subject. I'm happy to have it as a resource."
5,A unique documantation of the history of New Orleans.,What better a way to document the colorful history of New Orleans than to do it from the tables of its legendary saloons. Institutions that have played and still play an important role in the story book setting that is New Orleans. I keep this book on my living room coffee table and have gotten constant compliments on it.
1,Ahem,"Some of the history in this book is correct, but it's mixedwith a lot of dubious legends and a lot of outright inaccuracies.Also, I would not recommend this book as a bar-hopping guide for tourists ... the author leaves the reader with absolutely no indication of which bars are in safe neighborhoods, or how expensive some of them are. This book has some nice photographs, especially of some nice neon signs, and some of the write-ups are legit, but on almost every page there is something to make a New Orleanian cringe, like when it calls the steamboat Natchez ""luxurious"". All in all, this book is a gyp."
5,Great book,Lovely book to have in your collection is more poignant post Katrina this takes it back and reminds you of the rich history of the saloons of New Orleans photographs are spectacular
5,A Bourbon Street Hopper,"I don't think I've ever experienced anything quite like the bars in New Orleans! They are fantastic! The press has given Bourbon St. such a negative view, but I had no trouble the two times I went down by myself! I mean if you use a little common sense, then there's no problem! The people were some of the nicest I've ever met! Everyone treats you like family and you have such a great time! This book shows that down-home, friendly atmosphere! It was interesting for me too, to see a lot of the places off of Bourbon that I didn't get to see! You know, the 5 star places that cost an arm and a leg, and require reservations! This is just another great book to relive memories of your trip to ""Sin City."""
1,Don't buy it,"Don't buy it. Very disappointed with the product. I had high expectations for it after reading reviews at Gizmodo, but once I ordered one...Sound:No Bass - at all - even after a 24H burn in. I am not talking about ""subwoofer bass"" - this thing sounds more like those headphones we get in airplanes.The specs promise a 15hz - to 35KHz range, but a can't frigging hear the kick drum or bass lines (which sits between 60 and 80Hz).Build:* Solid;* The way the foam rests are glued to the cups is pretty rough - we can see glue spilling out. Not the kind of quality you would expect from Tascam.Beware that the seller (Redmonger) charges a 10% restocking fee for returns."
2,Fostex t50 rp,"Not what I expected..will need modification..for the price,its.excellent.Great build quality..These phones need a good amp to power them.I rate the Fostex t50rp a 5 star product..My issue is with the seller-redmonkerPrior to shipment,sent him 2 e-mails, never got a response.Packaging was poor..bottom part of the box was almost entirely opened,he did not even put foam in the box.I give redmonker......1 starLook elsewhere if you need these headphones...B&H; is highly recommended"
5,Excellent Headphones for the price.,"This is a great pair of headphones for those who want good headphones for home use. They are a bit ""bassy"" for my tastes, but otherwise they are great. Music is very detailed, and human voices sound naturally through them without colorations."
5,Over 10 years and counting...,"Ok, so after well more than 10 years of home studio use the pads are starting to fray a bit. Having said this, they sound as superb as the day I got them. I'm looking to buy another identical pair (or two), which made me notice some reviews, which made me realize that after a decade of satisfied use I should finally offer up my $0.02 too."
2,as andy warhol wanted to name a tv show: Nothing Special,"just like baudrillard and zizek, he's provocative but too often predicting last week's news -- and getting it wrong. are all wars now like video games? NO. that was such an easy thing to say, but premature and unoriginal. you can get half of these so-called ""insights"" from any pretentious college professor in the world."
1,False advertising Wrong credits listed,"This movie shamefully is using the Credits for THINGS 1989 even though it is a film by the same name from 1993. Do Not be fooled - Amber Lynn, Barry J. Gillis, Doug Bunston and others from the movie THINGS (1989) are not in this movie. If you are a fan of THINGS 1989 or looking to buy it, avoid at all cost."
4,Enjoyable,"I never watched this series during its original showing. I was pleasantly surprised. Good plots, writing, and acting, around relevant societal issues."
1,Don't Mix With Grey's Anatomy,"I had to forward through the cross over from this series when trying to watch Grey's Anatomy. It was like extra commercials. I was not sure where to complain about this, but I do not like the Private Practice series at all. I have similar reasons what I do not like this series as other 1 stars. It is hard to believe they used same writers as Grey's. I did not enjoy drama, characters and story. The red head lady doctor was my least favorite character from Grey's, so this made Private Practice ieven worse for me."
3,"Could Be Better, Great Acting Though","To be honest, I'm not quite sure what to think of Private Practice. The show focuses more on the sexual relations of the doctors and their egos than on medicine or their practice, Oceanside Wellness Group. And for me, that gets old really fast!If I had my way, the show would focus more on why the doctors started the practice than on their personal lives. Because the idea of a medical practice that wants to bring back the ""small town doctor"" and cares more about the patient's well-being and less on money matters, more on caring for the ""whole body"" and less on simply trying to fix the ""symptoms"" is such a breathtaking idea--and one that I would hope would catch on in real life.I received a complimentary copy to review."
1,Destroyed Chemistry,"Dell gone and moving on I am no longer interested in Private Practice. Bummer, just purchased and won't even finish the season. Waste."
3,Better than its preceeding season but not good enough.,"I admit that with this season the quality of the show raised but there are still some holes in the storylines. The show doesn't do its best to keep the audience watching, it doesn't have that comedic but also dramatic feeling as strong as its parent show. I appreciate the writers for not making this show ""The Addison Show"" and giving other characters highlighted storylines. It's an improvement on the first season and I hope it will keep getting better as it continues but it still isn't a brilliant or a great show. 8/10."
5,Exciting challenge!,"I tried this after using Rodney Yee's beginner tapes for 6 months. It's a more challenging workout, and I was thrilled to learn that I could do headstands, elbow stands, etc. The tape is broken down into three sections, so if you're not ready for the upside down stuff, you can skip to the next section. A great addition to your workout library!"
2,INSTRUCTOR ASSUMES PERFECTION,"Only buy this tape if you can do head stands without assistance and if while sitting with legs extended you can place your forehead on your knees and your hands around the bottom of your feet. if you can't do things like this you won't be able to do at least 1/3rd of the poses in this tape. Yee doesn't offer any easier modified alternatives so you if you can't do these things you can miss out on entire segments. the tape is also a little too dreamy for my tastes as it emphasizes the hawaiin surroundings and spiritual enlightment aspects of yoga throughout the workout. i prefer more practical, down to earth deliveries of yoga instruction."
2,Not for Beginners,Don't make the mistake I did of thinking that a flexible person in fairly good shape could skip the beginning tape and go straight to the intermediate. I can do Patricia Walden's yoga for flexability (a great tape and fairly challenging) so I thought I could do this tape. This tape is absolutely only for the experienced practicer of yoga. I found about ninty percent of the moves impossible and gave up on the tape about half way through and returned it to the store.
3,COOL,THIS ITEM IS COOL BUT I PREFER NORMAL CONTROLS OVER ANNALOG. I DONT LIKE THE CONSTANT SHAKING BUT IF U DO THIS IS FOR U!!!
1,One of the stupidest games ever,"Stupid, don't waste your time on this game, even if someone give it to you."
3,"A handy ""Aviation Art "" primer - drawing aircraft in pencil.","Occasionally turns up for sale used. Good chance someone can track one down for you if you are patient. This is a friendly little softcover book- almost a booklet. 92 pages, landscape format- approx 8 inches by 5 inches. Mostly text, with many small sketches. The book has plenty of sound pointers to steer you clear of the common mistakes. The whole thrust is to help you enjoy sketching airplanes and cloudscapes in pencil. I wish it had been published in hard cover. I want my copy to be around for a long time.Cam Martin"
3,"Good reading, but funny idea about enligthenment","Interviews with disciples of Papaji/Poonjaji. Good idea, nicely done. Only the interviewd people, except the son of Papaji, seem to be rather brain-leaky. One may like it, if one likes the non religious aproach to spirituality. But even then, it sounds too easy, that one just walks in with a guru and realizes the highest spiritual truths, then soon becomes a spiritual teacher and would have reached the end of wisdom. So I'd take the book as an example, how it should not be, but it's hard work, to figure out exactly whats wrong, because it sounds quite authoritative and unrefutable at certain pages. It's just simple interviews, but their omisions imply a lot which needs rethinking, (which, I think, is good:-)."
3,Not as nice as the picture.....,"It's a nice frame, but not as high quality as the picture made it look (and as I would've expected for the price). Mine came with a small chip in the corner and cracked paint at one of the joints. It's not a luxury product - but is acceptable."
3,"Great Product, Not-so-great Condition","I was looking for a classy frame that holds 5 4x6 pictures, so my options were somewhat limited. I liked this design for its simplicity and Umbra makes a good product. However, both of the frames I ordered arrived with noticeable scratches/scuffs in the paint. Otherwise, the rest of the finish was very nice and this product is still quite a bargain. I am pretty happy that I paid less for 2 frames on Amazon than I would have for one in a store."
4,great little vocab book,"A Basic Latin Vocabulary by J. Wilson & C. Parsons is a pretty darn good little handbook for a beginning Latin vocabulary. Words that are similar in spelling are grouped together so you can remember them better. For example, the book lists all the ""post"" words together, i.e. post, postea, postquam, posterior, postremus. It is a small, light, easily portable book that is very cconvenient for studying in the car or on airplanes or waiting in a doctor's office. Also, it does not contain too many words so you do not get overwhelmed. If you are interested in a good book for starting a basic Latin vocabulary, buy this one!"
5,Great service,Product was sent fast and was exactly as it looked in pictures. It now looks great on my wall. Would certainly recomment this store.
2,came with a broken branch,when I opened the box I found that a branch was broken off from one tree.Disappointing! But superglue did the wonders.
3,"Not bad, but not smooth","This isn't the smoothest compilation out right now, even if you're into lounge-oriented stuff. I was looking for more of an ambient vibe from this disc that just wasn't there. It had a really strong undercurrent of 60s lounge stuff, which is cool if you're into that, but won't necessarily chill you out like, say, ""Serve Chilled"" or the ""Om Lounge"" series. This one's for more of the hardcore suit and martini crowd, not the laid-back blunt on a sofa, 3 AM cool crowd."
4,"nice, nice, but....","This cd it's very nice given you the right atmospera not only at home but also in your prefered lounge.The mix of the music is going from the pop trought the jazz passing from the latin sounds. In a very smart cover you can find important names like Bent, Groove Armada, Nicola Conte but the best music is coming from the unknows (for me) artists.In my title ther is a but....infact this cd it's very near at the five stars..but...but there is the last song by Trafalgar a tremendus la la la for more than 4 minuts. Why this song is in this cd? I don't know and it's a pity. Somentime it's better a Cd 67 minuts long than a 71 but with a very last bad song that give you a wrong impression of the whole cd."
5,Perfect results.,"Fast shipping, packaged great, and loved the paint! Went on well and had a nice hard finish. Would rccomend this company and this paint. Thank you!"
2,Not that good,"i thought the the new empire earth II would be as thrilling and exciting as the first version. Wrong. Requieres too much ram resources, and the game it's just not fun anymore, even tough has some cool new features but the game isn't friendly enough."
1,Don't waste your time and/or money!,"This unbelievably slow-paced game adds nothing new to the genre: Empire Earth 2 is just ""yet another"" RTS. The plethora of units only detracts from the game (who needs to memorize 300+ units and their special characteristics), and the division of the game into ""territories"" has been one of the worst ideas EVER.This game has been reviewed as ""Rise of Nations""-esque. Don't waste your money with this, as Rise of Nations is a better game than this will ever become. The plethora of resources (remember, Rise of Nations already has had complaints about the number of resources IT has, Empire Earth II just increases even more resources you have to run around) are not manageable as there IS no idle-citizen auto-control.All-in-all: Empire Earth II may contain some brilliant ideas, but the entirety of the game is pure, utter crap."
1,Doesnt work,"The only good this game is good for is crashing your computer. when it works it extremely slow and unplayable. You have to hack the configuration files just to get it somewhat playable when it should work right out of the box. The developer abandoned support. If you get it working for the 10 minutes that it does work the graphics are terrible. Empire Earth 1 is better, the graphics were better and the game was playable. What happened this time??Do not buy this game. Save your $50 and get Rise of Nations or Empire Earth 1 instead. Wait until this in the 9.95 bargin bin if you want to try this junk out. Mad Doc please spare us Empire Earth III."
3,Great graphics - Poor playability,"I have been playing Strategy games since 1985. I remember a game originally written for Unix computers that was illegally translated to the PC called Empire. The first RTS games like Age of Empires blew me away and I followed that line until Age of Mythology. At that point, I switched to The Empire Earth series and played Empire Earth until Empire Earth II was released. I couldn't wait to buy it, but I have been very disappointed. The game has great graphics and sound, but the computer opponents don't play very well and are pretty easily defeated. Age of Mythology chased me away from the Age of Empires series and Empire Earth II has chased me away from the Empire Earth series. I am now playing Age of Empires III. It is a much better game. If you are new to RTS games, you will have fun with Empire Earth II but if you have been doing this for a while, I would pass on this game."
3,"Good Game, But EEI Is Better","Don't get me wrong, EEII is a good game. But it isn't as good as EEI. The thing that messed it up is it tried to combine the characteristics of Rise of Nations with the classical EEI. Rise of Nations is not as good as EEI, and when the two were mixed, you got a slower, much worse off game. The people who play the Empire Earth series are not looking for borders and what, seven different resources. They are looking for an RTS that you build and you conquer, quite simply. Bottom line- Empire Earth should not play like a game which has features beyond conquest and economy. In Sierra trying to do that, it has wrecked a game I thought would be a better version of EEI. What I got was Rise of Nations II."
1,Beware! Beware! Beware!,"Hi to buyers of this game,Beware!I played this game at my friends house and guess what, it SUCKS !!! Do you know why? Because when I tryed to put some buildings on the terrain it turned red (that means that I can't put the building there), and guess what? My terrain wasn't at a mountain or something, it was on a flat ground!! Plus it doesn't have any custom civ. option and it doesn't have campaign builder.Either way, Empire Earth 2 is just a game.As a reviewer below had stated Empire Earth 1 is better because it have calamities that are caused by prophets, which are not in this game for some kind of reason. Either way save your money on Empire Earth 1 which is now very chip, and the BEST! Or wait till Empire Earth 3 comes out in about 2 years I think, which I hope will ROCK THE WORLD!!!"
3,Empire Earth II ??,"i received the item in a timely manner, and is in great condition, however the item received was the expansion and not the full version of the Empire Earth II, so the item picture and description was very misleading."
1,Major disappointment,"I thought this game would be a great one and an improvement over the first EE. Well, not quiet, this EE2 has nothing to offer, the grqphics look like the ones in Age of Empires II (realeased in 1999 I believe). The game runs slow, i have a computer with the following specifications:*Windows XP*Dx 9.0c*Intel Pentium 4 3.06 GHz*2 GB of RAM*256 RAm video cardand yet the game runs slow.I love Empire Earth I because the graphics are good, and the game runs smoothly...This new released now is a major disappointment, and I dont understand why if the graphics are not good. The gaphics of this game look like a paint by an abstract painter.If you have played the first Empire Earth, you will see the difference between EE I and EE II, and you will go back to the first one.Save your money and play EE I ntil these guys come with a real improvement over EE I."
4,In regards to your question about the game I purchased.,"The person I gave it to for Christmas really likes it, I don't know about the likes or dislikes but for my mid-twenty's brother it was a good gift !"
4,Its a good game and works on Windows 8 with some tweaking,I have to switch my resolution down to 1024 x 768 to get it to work but other than that its a pretty good upgrade from the 1st EE.
5,Has lasted us 3 years!,"I purchased the chalk board paint when we first moved into our new home three years ago. I used it on a large piece of wood (former table top) that I sanded down. I wanted an area that would be large enough for my two girls, then 2 and 6. I primed the wood with the magnetic paint first then applied the chalk board paint. My husband was very skeptical, he said it would never work and it was a waste of money....3 years later my girls are still enjoying the huge chalk board! It is an awesome idea for a play room or kids room. For the cost of a couple of jars of paint and some time, I repurposed a table that we were going to throw away. I am exceedingly pleased with the product and how well it has stood the test of both time and children and it is used often. From keeping score on the Wii to playing school....we love it!"
1,Excellent product but...,"I used this to cover an entire wall in my garage and it worked amazing. However, I'm only giving it 1 star because you can get it for much cheaper at Home Depot. I got a 30oz container for $9.98. Go to Home Depot!"
5,Chalkboard paint is awesome!,"I had purchased a quart of this paint local over a year ago and used it on a diy project inthe kitchen. Loved it! However, when I needed another quart for a laundry room project, I couldn't find it locally. What gives? Anyway, Amazon came through for me and with prime membership, it didn't even cost for shipping. I painted a wall of drawer fronts with it and could not be more pleased! Chalk lets me label the drawers to indicate the contents, and if I decide to move things around, I can change my labels no problem. Love the paint!"
4,Works just like it says,"I painted a cabinet with this paint, on top of magnetic primer and it looks great. Looks slightly bumpy, but that is most likely from the roller I used to put it on. Super fast and easy to use, though it seems like it might be a bit stubborn to erase. Overall, a good product and now I have a nice looking chalkboard wall."
3,Rather quaint,"I consider the sixth installation in the series to be rather weaker than the others. There is not as much variety in the art presnted within, and there is far too much (for my tastes) pseudo-fantastic art - the kind that deals with erotics, ""babes wielding giant weapons"", super-powered combat, etc. The volume does have many redeeming qualities, but they are not numerous enough to atone for the book's flaws. The fifth volume was SO much better."
4,a great book,"""In vain did the Bedouins strive to cut down and overpower the two champions; in vain did they urge their horses to ride over them. With each sweep of his axe the king either dismounted a foe or clove in the head of his steed, and a wall of slain around them testified to the tremendous power of their arms.""Winning his spurs by G.A. Henty is a well written HF story during the time of the crusades. In the story Cuthbert, a young boy of Saxon and Norman blood, along with his friend Cnut and Cnut's band of outlaws do the Earl of Evesham a great honor by saving his daughter the Lady Margaret from a nearby enemy. In return the earl takes Cuthbert on a crusade with him as his squire. As a crusader Cuthbert fights against the muslin army, saves King Richard the Lionheart, befriends a hermit, and kills an evil knight trying to steal his inheritance.I think it's a great book about the crusades and middle ages and I would recommend it to anyone who loves adventure and war."
1,"Excellent story, Extremely poor edition by this publisher","The G.A. Henty story was excellent but this edition by Quiet Publishing was horrible. The book wasn't rectangular but wrongly cut on an angle and all the text was crooked inside. The binding was so poor the book fell apart as we were reading it. Order this book, just not from Quiet Publishing."
5,My Favorite Laymon Book,"Like Stephen King said, Richard Laymon is a real treat.If you are a lover of over-the-top horror, blood, sex and great endings Laymon is your man! All of that remains true in Island.I banged out this 504 page masterpiece in about 3 1/2 days reading it at the gym on the Elliptical, on a break from work, and before bed...I could NOT keep it down!The storytelling is great with enough detail to the characters (nothing excessive), supsense, twists, turns, nasty deaths and boobs glorious boobs! Everything that makes a Laymon book fun.If you've never read anything from Mr. Laymon, I suggest you start here. You will not be disappointed. Then check out Night In The Lonesome October and The Travelling Vampire Show."
1,don't waste time or money on this one,"I read a number of reviews from people about Laymon, and thought I'd give him a try. This is the second book of his I have read. I can't imagine spending any more more money on him. I couldn't care about any of the characters. The dialogue was juvenile at best. Some of the actions of Rupert either made no sense or were simply stupid. In reading this one and Darkness..., I was reminded of something a creative writing teacher said years ago to his class: sex is fine in a novel if it serves or furthers some part of the storyline. Don't just put it in to fill pages. Laymon should have been in that class. This neverending fascination with breasts is ridiculous. It kills the flow of the story and at times seems completely out of place. Save your money and avoid this one."
4,Perfect waste of time...in a good way!,"I really liked this book! I just could not put it down. It has sex, horror, gore, torture; you know all the good stuff!! Narrated by your typical sex crazed teenage boy this is a fast paced thrill ride!! I have only read on other Laymon book (Traveling Vampire Show, which I also liked) but from now on he's on my must read list. This book would have rated 5 stars except I'm a chick, and I had to deduct one star for all the feminist out there (due to all the graphic women oggling contained in the book.)"
1,This is one island you don't want to visit.,Extensive and unnessary use of foul language; main character obsessed with sex. Ending totally out of line with rest of plot. I wish I could get my money back.
3,It was different,The part that disturbed me the most was in the end the author decided to incorporate 14 year olds into the story and it's disturbing ending.
1,Misogyny disguised as literature,"This book lavishes loving detail on the juvenile sexual fantasies of the admittedly unattractive protagonist, who winds up enslaving all the sexually attractive women in the book,and graphically punishing the unattractive woman who does not succomb to the protagonist's sexual overtures. As a woman reading this book I was extremely disturbed by its pandering and objectification of the novel's women. I suppose the author excuses this misogyny by attributing it to his character, but there is nothing in the book that censures, punishes or even disapproves of the protagonist's attitude. I felt slightly nauseated when I gave up reading this book after it became clear that it was nothing more than an extended pornographic depiction of some man's fantasy."
2,Island,"Island Poorly written, too long for such a bad story line, not worth the read. Would not recommend though I did finish it disappointed"
3,"Ten Little Flies, Layman style.","Poor Rupert Conway quickly comes to regret going on a Caribbean outing with his soon to be ex-girlfriend's family. Things take a turn for the nightmarish when the yacht explodes, leaving the group stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere, and one of the party begins killing them off one by one. ISLAND is a sex and sadism heavy blending of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians (aka And Then There Were None) and Golding's Lord of the Flies told in Layman's own distinctive voice and style. Loaded down with the late author's trademarked sexual tension, shocking violence, taunt suspense, and wicked humor, this novel will no doubt satisfy the late author's growing number of fans."
1,"Started out interesting, then (seriously) degenerated.","It's as if a sexually twisted13-year-old rendered a slightly interesting plot. It's one of those ""I wish I hadn't read this"" books. I didn't finish, because about halfway through it turned into something really unpleasant and was getting worse."
5,marcy's books,RICHARD LAYMAN IS A MASTER AT HORROR. HE DOES IT AGAIN. THIS BOOK WILL GRAB YOU AT THE VERY BEGINING AND NOT LET GO. JUST LIKE ALL HIS BOOKS. YOU HAVE TO READ THE INTRODUCTION BY DEAN KOONTZ. FOR A HORROR WRITER HE CAN BE FUNNY. THE ONLY BAD THIND IS RICHARD LAYMAN IS NO LONGER WITH US. NO MORE NEW BOOKS. I'LL HAVE TO MAKE DO REREADING SOME OLD FAVORITES. IF YOU LOVE HORROR LIKE I DO YOU WILL LOVE ANYTHING FROM RICHARD LAYMAN. THIS BOOK GETS 5 STARS FROM ME.
1,Repetitive dull,This book is a waste of time too gory and unsatisfying and exhibitionistic depressing Don't keep looking for it to improve as it wont
3,It's okay,"The premise isn't too believable but all in all a good story. Somewhat long getting from point A to B to C. Typical Laymon writing, good if you like it.........."
4,Horrorified Hemingway? Gilligan's Island Gone Bad!,"Who can give this book one star? Obviously someone who doesn't understand that horror books, or any other book, should contain great characters, a sense of humor, unique perspective, and twists galore.Laymon has had some amazing books out there that are straight out horror, but this one is a slow builder, although entertaining all the way. It's a mystery/suspense novel moreso than horror, but so what? All that matters is that it's worth reading.Not many writers could write and layer characters like Laymon did, especially with such deceptively simple prose. Yet in this manner, he allows the story to grow, layer upon layer until this ""simple"" novel is deep & entralling.Hopefully, more readers will give this & all his novels a chance."
5,Island,This is Richard Laymon at his best. The book typifies all that makes it impossible to put down a Richard Laymon book. There is mystery and humour as well as the usual liberal sprinkling of violence and sex.A must for anyone who has enjoyed any of Laymon's books.
4,"Great start, great story - but the end is weak...","The funny thing about that book is - Rupert (the guy telling the story) is so horny that it's hard for him to think about another thing than to stare at (or if possible under) the bikinis of the girls which are with him on the trip to a lonely island.He's still horny, even when man after man gets killed in a very brutlal way and it becomes clear that he is the next on the killer's list . . .After a few pages of the book you won't stop reading because it's really thrilling an (as I wrote above) very funny sometimes.It also has some sudden and unexpected turns during the story.The whole story is great, from the beginning up almost to the end.But it seems to me that Laymond was in a hurry when he finished the book - I was not really happy with the end.Nevertheless - I can recommend it; everyone who likes thrillers will love this one!"
2,Not a book I care for,It started off promisingly. The writing itself was ok. At times there were amusing moments. The story is told from the point of view of an 18 year old boy. I'm sure lots of people will like the book but I didn't care for the almost constant sexual commentary the main character spewed. I didn't like the prolonged descriptions of corpses. I found the characters cartoonish. The book is like an immature sexist fantasy. Finally a little over 2/3 in I couldn't take it any more and skipped to the end. I hated the ending. What a monster. Now I just need some time for that garbage I read to leave my head. There are lots of other writers. I won't be reading any more from this author.
2,Why are all the main characters stupid?,"This could have been a good book. It had a great plot and for the most part good characters, but why in the world can the author actually think a person reading it would want to continue to the end knowing that the main character (who's telling this tale) can be so stupid and so horny as to put himself in jeopardy over and over and over and over again. I'm really becoming disillusioned with authors today. Do they think we (the readers) want someone who is stupid to survive. Very sad to think Dean Koontz thinks enough of this author to write such a lengthy and interesting introduction. I'm just glad I didn't pay more than $2 to read this."
3,One of the better ones...BUT....,"3.5/5 stars. I thought it was a decent book. But you really should know what Laymon is all about before you go ahead and get into his novels. There is a lot of sexual stuff and rape that can be disturbing. The one major thing that bothers me about it is that its not realistic. When someone is being murdered or hunted they shouldn't be getting turned on...especially in each and every one of Laymon's novels. It is also disturbing that he always speaks sexually of teenagers. I'm currently 29 years old and find it absolutely disgusting that Laymon talks about sex and nudity of 14 year olds like its completely okay. I'm no prude but that is wrong. Anyhow, if you'd like to read my full review of this book you can visit the site listed in my profile (Shivers of Horror) where I do horror movie and horror book reviews."
1,Purile Idiocy,"Simply one of the worst horror novels to come down the pike in a long, long time. The late Laymon was perhaps the biggest misogynist to ever set pen to paper.Avoid this drivel at all costs.Utterly inane and devoid of any entertainment value whatsoever."
3,Kinda Makes Me Feel Bad About Being a Guy,"It's a very well-written book and it keeps you wondering what could possibly happen next. The story is told from a horny young male's point of view and his interest in sex borders on the obsessively perverse. Throughout the story his point of view is virtually always about glimpsing a peek at the female castaways bodies. Titilating as it is, the familiarity of such thoughts and tendencies made me blush in embarrassment for the amount of testosterone in my body. There are some shocking and shameful moments, particularly a gruesome scene involving child sexual abuse that made me want to throw the book away, but I held on to see if the character could in any way redeem himself. I should've thrown the book away when I had the chance."
3,bad closeure!!!,Good storyline... good characters......great villans.....keeps your interest...but weak ending...laymon always seems to have a strong start and keeps you interested throughout.......but ending disappoints......
3,Rubert,Rupert was a nerdy young man with a lot to learn. I like this story. Why do I have to post so many words when I only needed 15 for my review?
3,Different,lot of teenage male sexual fantasy. The story was pretty good but a little slow. It is not something most people would like.
2,Island,I I thought it was a sorry read and kept hoping it would have a good ending. IT DIDN'T Sorry is the the word tahat fits.
2,A no-brainer,"I was extremely excited about reading this book when I saw that both of my favorite authors had written so highly of it. What a disappointment. A few pages in, I suspected what the outcome would be. I found the book to be disgusting. I continued to read ONLY because I was hoping for a fairy tale ending. I definitely will not be wasting any more of my money on books by Richard Laymon...may he rest in peace."
2,Not good,Plot is simple and predictable. Story told first person by a sexually starved 18 year old boy. If you like good prose and interesting tales then don't bother with this one.
2,Wild story,"The story line is weird and unbelievable. Also, many spelling errors. I probably will not read another novel by this author real soon"
3,Different,Very perverted but great story line. I wish the story ended with a much better hero. I had high hopes for him.
4,First timer,I will not give any story line away. I am a first time reader of R. Laymon books. I enjoyed the fleshing out of characters and did not want the story end. What more do u want from a book?
2,Island - could have been great,"This story started out with a bang, then became so redundant, I could not wait for the end. Sorry, I really liked it in the beginning, it was very suspenseful. Then it was a lot of repetition, and just kind of seemed stuck in a rut. I did however enjoy the forward by Dean Koontz."
4,A story of conflict and great responsibility.,"Adiamante seems to follow the underlying theme that most of Modesitt's works incorporate. Once again there is found a people who wish nothing more than to be left alone, yet are forced to protect themselves at great price. Modesitt continues to write of the inherent lack of understanding by most people. There are those characters that will not listen to reason. They must go their own course untill they are forced to act differently. The main characters cannot, by their very nature, act in a pre-emptive manner for any reason. Modesitt's developement of the ideas expressed in the ""Paradigms of Power"" and the ""Construct"" work excellently with this theme. All in all a good read and I look forward to the next book sent forth."
4,"Well done, but blandly seasoned","This novel presents a compelling entree to a mythos/universe that the author expands in other novels, but Adiamante may lack the vicersal tug that you get from a truly great novel. Well worth reading, even loosing sleep for, but by the very nature of its characters and message, not one you'll push on your friends.More mature and thoughtful readers will remember this one fondly, and return to it often."
5,Utopia encounters Empire,"This is a unique book among Modesitt's works. It describes the restraints a Utopian society places upon its own actions to preserve its state, even when encountered with an opponent whose intention is to glass the entire planet. It has such gems of thought as the concept that most societies tend to avoid honesty (or full honesty) because of the destabilizing effects of the high priority individuals and groups of individuals place on the ego.To be fair, I've noticed this to be the general case. Different societies have different rules for what truths are spoken, and when it is appropriate to speak them.Whether you agree with the concepts you encounter or not, they will expand your ability to think practically about humanities tendencies towards power and the controls that societies put in place to override those urges."
5,Great!,"This has to be my favorite book by L. E. Modesitt Jr. (I've read about ten).I'm prone to multi-volumne series, but this one is short but sweet."
5,It's just labels,How to you really review Labels? They work just fine and are OEM.. I haven't tried non-oem on the dymo machine and this works just like I expected.
3,WORK BOOTS COMFORTABLE BUT.............,Purchased boots for my husband who stated they are very comfortable however the seam in the boot is beginning to let go already - haven't had them for very long so I do not believe I would purchase them again
4,A monster's manipulation at it's best. . .,"Can any person actually travel at the speed of light ?MaybeOr manipulate the physical atmosphere, by having you to be standing one moment and then in an instant, in a blink of an eye then having you holding a gun in a sitting position and aiming it at your own head ?PossiblyThis thing called 'ticktock' or better known to the reader as Bryan Drackman can do all of the above, or at least to the naked eye it seems that way. With the ability to control and manipulate time and Space Bryan Drackman bears virtually any of these abilities and then some.The extent of ""ticktock's"" powers will leave everyone is his world Absolutely Vulnerable, but just as we have weaknesses and flaws so does this Koontz character, That's what makes this piece worth the readDean I have one thing to Say to youYOU GO BOY !"
2,some parts of it were really good.....most of it stunk,"Something about this book was off. I have never read a Koontz book i didn't like until this one. Right off the characters were hard to relate to, and just about everything was not explained. Like what Bryan Drackman was ""Becoming"". Was it a Devil, a god, WHAT?? It never said!!! Also the thing it never said that bothered me the most is Drackman's motive - why did he want to kill Janet, Danny, Harry, Connie and Sammy??? When Koontz said ""His Greatest and Most Secret Power"" over and over it seemed so childish. Why did bryan act like such a child??? There was one pretty exciting part and that was the Pause. That was about it though. All and all this book didn't do enough explaining, the characters were 2 dimensional (had no depth) and seemed to lack the ""horror"". If you don't like books that you have NO idea what is going on - i suggest you do not read Dragon Tears."
4,fast paced and intriguing,"I have read just about every Dean Koontz book with the exception of ""Fear Nothing"" (which I still have to read) and ""Twilight Eyes"". It started off quite differently and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get into it but once I was in, I was hooked. It was fast paced and the characters were as usual very well described. Not perhaps his best, in fact I would give it only three and a half stars but nevertheless entertaining and fun!!"
1,I thought the book lacked style.,"In my opinion the book was a two thumbs up book. The begining started off fastpaced and intresting. It made you want to keep reading, at first. Then it started to get slow and boring, it was unable to hold my intrest so i stopped reading on page sixty-five. The way Dean Koontz shifted from story to story kind of confused me, you were'nt getting the answers like who was the rat guy. So I thought this book was weak, I read some of his other books and they were exellent. basically I give this book two thumbs down."
5,a fantastic thriller,"This is the kind of book you just got to finish in one sitting. It keeps you hooked with a strong need to know what will happen next. The only thing that bothered me was the end, which was less climaxing thant what Dean had made us to expect from all the tension he built up. Nevertheless, another master piece. Read it."
3,Good up to the end,I enjoyed 99% of this book. It was fast paced and the characters were well developed. The ending however was pretty bad. I don't want to spoil it but the book was so fast paced and full of action then he just stopped. It almost seemed incomplete.
2,Flawed,"Suspenseful and somewhat literate during the first few hundred pages, Dragon Tears is way too long. I lost interest in it about halfway in. The stock characters became annoying (why don't they ever do or say anything besides the usual horror genre prattle) and the plot became extremely linear. I knew the ending and did not want to meet it once again under such miserable circumstances. Koontz is better than King and Barker is better than Koontz but does anyone really care?"
1,Forced myself to finish,"It's been a long time since I read this book, but I have to say it left a mark. I always rush out to buy the latest Koontz book and was really happy when I found one I'd missed for only $5 in hardback! Well, when I finished the book, I was rather disappointed at having wasted $5. Clearly the worst book he's written, I felt like he was beating me over the head with his views of good and evil and the decline of morality in today's society. Nice try, Dean, but you can do better."
1,Would Not Sugest,"I have read a lot of Dean Koontz books and have enjoyed all of them, up to this point. I literally had to force my self to finish this book. Usually I finish his books (Watchers, Cold Fire, etc.) within a matter of a week TOPS. This one took me at least 3 months. It had a lot of depressing themes, more so than others. This was clearly his worst book yet."
1,"Whew, ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","This book was one of the biggest letdowns in a while. I was all pumped up for one of Koontz's good ""get your attention and hold it hostage"" books but the ENDING. THE ENDING was beyond terrible. I was just sitting there going WHAT! Is that it?Highly disappointing, bland, run of the mill, no imagination ending. Sorry folks but that's how I saw it in my world."
5,YOWZA!!,"This is the book that really hooked me on Dean Koontz. The creative characters jump out at you. Koontz creates an empathy with the protagonists that has you biting your nails until dawn, the time when Tick Tock comes to call. I am not naturally inclined to the macabre, but this book is absolutely spellbinding. It is a GOOD STORY."
4,"Slow start, then spell binding. Loved the dog!","Unlike most of the authors books, this one was harder to get interested at the start. Once the characters were presented the book takes off. I loved the dog! The ending is also great, just ask the dog"
1,Awful...and I was a fan!,"Do not waste your time, while Koontz does have some ability this one is so cheesy and stupid it was torture to finish. When I start reading books in the perspective of I dog, I know I am reading something for a child."
3,Another Good title for Koontz,"This book was very interesting. The characters were fun and fairly engaging. The killer was were the book really shined though. I would put the book in the same category as The Bad Place, as far as how good it is and the originality of the villains. If you want a good read and don't mind it not being based in reality, pick up a copy."
3,Interesting but far too verbose......,"Well it's an interesting concept in occult thrillers, and certainly well read by Jay Sanders, despite occasional lapses into boring monotone. His voice describing the world as seen through the eyes of a dog are hilarious. My complaint with this presentation is the meandering verbose style of the author that regularly has you screaming for him to get back to the story.In the middle of crucial scenes he takes wordy diversions, through the voice of his characters. The ramblings are not always relevant, often preachy and irritatingly moralizing. By the time he has finished you have forgotten the point of the current episode or have lost the feeling of suspense. If ever there was an author in need of a good editor, this is a prime example."
3,Not his best effort,"Dean Koontz is known as a razor sharp writer, who can keep the story going and at the same time develop and nurture his characters. This is the case in Dragon Tears, but the story, lacks the optimistic and satisfying quality that his other novels had. This novel couldn't get me to jump on the wagon to solve the mystery behind the events, in a nut-shell I didn't really care, what happened. I will say that Koontz(as always)keeps the story going and this was an entertaining read, but it just had a dark cheerless spirit behind it."
2,Decent--Could be Much Better,"I have read several Koontz novels. It seems like we are beginning to see patterns from previous novels(i.e. dogs, TICKTOCK(actually another book), supernatural, warped personalities). I feel like I have read a similar story from previous stories written by Koontz. I think the dog piece is a stretch. The explanation of Bryan was another reach for the reader. I didn't feel the characters and their interaction with TICKTOCK was a good fit. I would recommend the book--but if you are a Koontz fan--you have seen this type of story before."
4,A very well-drawn portrait of police detective fiction!,"Dean Koontz has drawn a compelling profile of police work, the stress involved, and what unexpected things can happen in an ordinary day. While his heros are a bit prototypical, his villain is anything but. The referrals to actual crimes heightens the sense of reality and immediacy that is sometimes lacking in mysteries. For once, the female lead is neither screechily hysterical nor ""tough broad"" mean. The male lead is equally not a predictable type--quite refreshing! The use of the references to fairy tales to solve the crime, including an all-but-talking dog, shows the inventiveness and thorough research the author has utilized. Not many people realize just how sensitive a dog's nose is, but by the end of this trip with Woofer, you'll understand why your dog looks at you ""that"" way! All in all, an enjoyable, believable, fast-paced run through life in the cop lane."
4,An ENTERTAINING thrill-ride,"Koontz creates an action-packed thrill-ride that sparkles and shines despite some slow spots!! His characters are first-rate and fully developed with likeable personalitites and fresh persona's!!A gripping tale about a supernatural serial killer who is hunted down by a male-female pair of cops. Nothing really new here but in the hands of Koontz a very enjoyable novel! DK has a way of taking an old premise and working his special brand of magic to create a new idea!!Koontz is a joy to read and if u haven't picked up his novels, u can certainly start with this one!!"
3,First Koontz Novel... Interesting but not for me,This novel was pretty good at the beginning but as it went on i believe it lost my attention. The introduction of so many characters broke the flow of writing itself. Like at the beginning the crazy man in the restaurant was an awesome part then it took a 180 degree turn and started talking about a single mother and her child running away from an abusive boyfriend. The one thing I thought was interesting was the analysis from the dog but other than that it was an okay book. I was expecting just a normal murder mystery but it had some supernatural qualities to it which just confused me and thought it could be better without. Overall its an okay book; good if you like the fantasy aspects of it but if you are looking for just a solid mystery book inquire somewhere else.
2,First Koontz novel,"Could not agree with Milo ""gjm"" more (see second page of reviews). Although the story line captures the imagination some of the writing is down right atrocious. The author often felt the need to 'explain' what he means which I found demeaning and I think if I had read ""...it's the 90's"" one more time I would have flung myself off the nearest bridge.He digresses, pontificates and includes trivia that has no place in the story. Had the novel been 300 pages instead of nearly 400 I suspect it would have been a tightly knit, less frustrating and more coherent novel. This was the first book that I have read by Koontz and will be the last which is a shame because I do see a great deal of merit in the book. However poor writing is to me like chalk across a blackboard."
4,Must Read,"This book keeps you going from page one to the last line. The characters are real people it seems. You get frustrated, anxious, nervous, and happy all in one little book. Koontz does a good job of swtiching off from character to character to tie all parts of the story together. Harry Lyon is an unsuspecting hero, and Connie Gulliver is a hard-nosed woman who knows how to live life. A definite read for all Koontz diehards"
2,not his usual work to me,"i read this book yesterday and i was quite dissapointed. this book was not as suspensful as some readers stated or for the review it rcvd. alot of confusing scenes and got off to a good start then towards the middle, it got slow. Very graphic and grotesque in some scenes. the ending to me was quite weak, coul've made a stronger ending but anyhow, i am a Dean Koontx fan and love almost all his books, this however, was not to good."
4,"A great book, although a little slow at the start.","Dean Koontz is one of my favorite authors. I love the way he describes EVERYTHING so that it seems that you are standing right there with the characters. When the story finally started to move, it never stopped. I love the way he twists reality, and make even the impossible seem possible. Although this book was very good, my favorite of his books is INTENSITY. If you haven't read that, I highly recommend that you do."
5,"No ""pauses"" in this read","This start's rather bizarrely and Bryan's golem gets a tad boring. But the description of scenes in the pause is amazing. The excuses for Bryan's powers are a little run-of-the-mill and the main goodie characters as predictable and narrow minded as ever. But overall a memorable book, Koontz may not be good at creating goodies but he's an expert when it comes to baddies."
3,"KOONTZ, NOT AT HIS BEST, BUT AT LEAST KOONTZ","This is a cop story-- bad part-- written with a plot only Koontz can come up with-- good part. I felt like I was reading NYPD Blues-meets-The Twilight Zone. Excellent story, just lose the pigs (cops, this clarification is for my bf who is a little slow)."
3,King is better,Well I got the book to my Kendal without any problems. I am having a hard time reading this book. I prefer to read Stephen King and find it hard to read Dean Koontz. I don't think that he writtes as good as King.
2,Same old story,Koontz just changed the name of this book (ticktock) but the price was right and it is a good story.
4,Dragon Tears,RECIEVED PRODUCT PROMPTLY. I WAS UNABLE TO FIND THIS AT ALL THE BOOKSTORES I VISITED. I AM A VERY PLEASED CUSTOMER.
3,Mac's Line,"I was so excited upon finding this item....I waited and waited for it to arrive. Then it finally came, upon opening the package ready to put my filter back into operation and then the let down...it would not fit the housing from my old fluval 304 and one of the parts was broken. Now for the return, I had to take a picture of the item and upload it to the company. Thanks goodness I was able to do just that."
1,Don't waste your money,"Not worth the 5 bucks. Latch doesn't stay closed, doesn't fit well and the ""light blue"" is very dark, not at all what is pictured. This is the first time I have actually been disappointed enough to write a review."
3,better than nothing,"If you have no lead time, this is better than nothing. In the past I have resorted to keeping a bottle in a large Pyrex bowl with water and ice. This product is much better than that approach. I keep it in the freezer all the time, and I bring it out when I want a white on the spur of the moment. I agree that it will not keep wine cold for three hours, even if you started with a very well chilled bottle. It is nice, though, for covering up a label if it is ugly or shows that you bought cheap wine!"
1,Did not work for me,Did not chill a bottle that was room temperature that it claimed to do. Might be alright for some types of red wines that you just need a little cooling. Would not recommend
5,Great wine cooler does chill wine in 5 minutes,"Some of the reviewers said they wouldn't use this cooler to chill the wine, despite the manufacturer's claim to be able to cool it in 5 minutes. So, of course, I couldn't resist the challenge and bought one for my husband who prefers wine colder than I do. After putting the cooler into the freezer for the specified amount of time, It did a great job chilling a room-temperature bottle of wine in 5 minutes!"
4,Good Value,"For the money, it definitely does a good job. If you buy 2, you can have one in the freezer while using the other, and just keep rotating them. This is best if you plan on drinking more than one bottle."
4,Another fun romp in the Familias Universe,"Esmay is a hero who doesn't know how, or why, she did it. Or how to explain why she had such a natural command. Throughout the novel, she spends a great deal of introspection focusing in on herself -- and as a result, we learn about her culture, the military culture, and she is a real person. It sets up future novels beautifully, and is tied directly to the previous 3 novels in this universe."
4,The best of the Serrano/Suiza series,"Good solid space opera. While some aspects are clicheed, the heroine (along with some of the other supporting characters) is genuine enough to make the book worthwhile.The book can easily be read without reading the three earlier books in the series (Hunting Party, Sporting Chance, Winning Colors), which aren't nearly as good. The later books are also weaker, in my opinion."
2,bad editing,"A good adventure marred by bad editing. For example: Why would the Bloodhorde mine the ship, but then also put themselves aboard? I thought we'd discover that the mine was a feint, but after it is defused, we NEVER hear about it again. Other reviews have pointed out further inconsistencies, but this is the most glaring. Re: the debate about rape in the reviews, it is not the rape per se that put me off, but the clunky, heavy-handed description of treatment and the weak ending related to this. As a psychotherapist, I have to say that this section was poorly written and edited as well."
4,"good, but similar characterization and some discontinuties.","The book of 'Once a Hero' was a good story, but is this book along with her other one's all the characters seem to say the same phrases, and uaually act in a similar manner. Also there is the subject of horses, throughout all the books in this particular series horses, and all to do with them was said to be unconventional, and never done, but it is shown time and again, that they use horses for more things in her futureistic universe than we do now. I'm not saying this is a bad book, quite the contrary. As a side note, in her new book 'Rules of Engagement' It was said near the end that everyone uses the metric system, and no other, but the characters still speek of things in feet, and miles."
3,Good (but not excellent)SciFi,"""Once a Hero"" is good fantasy. The plot is ok and I do not agree to most of the critics mentioned below. I do, however, wonder why they have an important psych-department on board ship, but apparently no Marines that could deal with intruders. The main character is an interesting person and it is developed in a way that makes it coming alive for the reader. Probably Esmay is a more realistic character than Elizabeth Moon's Paksenarrion in the ""Deeds of P.""-trilogy. But that leads to the most serious shortcoming: In my opinion Moon did not do as well in describing a scifi-world as she did in discribing the fantasy-world in ""Sheepfarmers daughter"". Part of the atmoshpere-feeling I had there was missing here. Summarizing I would say, that Once a Hero is good SciFi, but not as dense as Moon`s fantasy, and not as technically perfect as for example David Weber's phantastical Honor Harrington series."
3,I would read an instruction manual if Elizabeth Moon wrote it. And I think I just did.,"On page 196 something finally happens. I enjoy Moon's writing style very much, and was introduced to her with the great Deed of Paksenarrion trilogy, a fantasy classic. The Heris Serrano trilogy was a fun sci-fi series with lots of action. But Once A Hero has little action and the thinking defects of the good guys (except for self-doubting Esmay)are all that can possibly enable any of the scant action by letting the twenty-five bad guys gain control of a gigantic spaceship crewed by twenty-five thousand good guys. But Moon's extensive, almost exhaustive info about the ship is interesting and enjoyable world building. Even though it was about as exciting as reading a shopping list, Elizabeth Moon has an engaging writing style that keeps me coming back for more."
2,Elizabeth Moon should stick to writing fantasies,"Before one sits down to write a space opera, one should have at least a nodding acquaintance with the key elements of a good one. Moon's science is laughable. She apparently has no knowledge of things military, either, as her military characters act, speak, and think in ways that are not credible. I'd have given this book 2.5 stars if that option was offered, because this is a purely average book. If you want good science fiction, read Heinlein or Pournelle. Ms. Moon should stick to writing fantasies."
2,serious disconnect,"i'm not sure whether it's jerry's automaton sounding voice, the speed at which the material is read, or something else, but for some reason this set of cds did not work for me. there is a serious disconnect whenever i try to listen to them and i quickly lose interest to what is being said.it's attributable, i think, to the way the material is read - in a monotone, dispassionate and at times hurried manner. jerry doesn't connect with the words he's reading, and it makes me lose interest.for me, trying to listen to this cd was a waste of time, and buying it was a waste of money.i do have many other abraham cds and i like them very much, but these sets (both part I and part II) are ones i was sorely disappointed by. the material is great, but the delivery is extremely disappointing."
2,Reads it Way Too Fast with No Emotion,"The issue isn't the content, but the way its read. It's like he had somewhere else he had to be and is rushing through it and not even caring about what is coming out of his mouth. I have also read the book, and this material deserves a better, slower, more thoughtful delivery."
2,Ask and it is given 1,the album titles do not display any order so I have to search my media player to find to next cd
1,what is this?????????,"This is a great way to spend one's hard earn money. Perhaps it is me, but I think most of the ""knowledge"" is common sense. The Hicks should be ashamed for coaxing up ""Abraham"". Believe in yourself, and remember ""Birds of the same feather flock together"" and what you give back is what you will received in return... Nuff Said."
5,Awesome!,"I finally had the chance to listen to Ask and It Is Given Part I (The Law of Attraction)on a recent road trip. I enjoyed it SO much that I had to purchase Part II ((The Process) while on the road and paid twice the price that I got Part I for on Amazon :( I would suggest if you get part I, get part II at the same time...awesome."
5,The real book on The Secret.,This book and CD set (I purchased both) are a practical and effective manual on how to get what you want and need and deepen your connection to yourself and your Source.
3,Interesting concepts,"This was an easy fun read, I just wish I could get their techniques to really work in my life. I've honestly tried to no avail."
3,A collection of articles,"This book contains some good information. However, it's clear that the publisher merely solicited a bunch of articles and sort of threw them together without much in the way of an overarching design. The result is that you can find answers to many common Tomcat questions in this book, but others will go unanswered.I agree with the previous comments that this book has some major gaps in its coverage of the topic. I would also comment that some of the presentation is pretty confusing, such as the whole area of data source configuration, which is actualy covered TWICE. Which section of the book where it's covered are you supposed to follow? And, as it turns out, even though this subtopic is covered twice, they still don't manage to give a complete explanation, leaving out the important issue of setting up a context.xml file.It's better than not having any Tomcat book at all, but this is not an exceptionally complete or well-organized book."
3,it is worth $25.,"I looked through it in 1 day, from the programmer point of view, what I learned is totally worth I paid for the book, I have a clear overall picture of Tomcat, the components ( server, service, host,contexs),directories,especially the class loaders that helps me develop my web applications.if you are just a programmer and a looking for some systematic inforation of Tomcat, you just need read 3 or chapters,probably this information is publiclly available in tomcat's offical website. this is why I finished in just 1 day."
5,"Buying my second copy, one for my workout studio, one for the kitchen!","This is a very effective book for living a healthy and fit life. Martina did a great job with this. The functional exercises that she includes are well-researched and state of the art. I enjoy them and I think they are more effective than what one finds in other books and fitness magazines. Great job, Martina!I am a former triathlete and was getting stale with my normal weight and cardio routine. Her exercises are great and seem to be working very well for me. The recipes are also wonderful and a great way to get out of my old rut.This is probably the best food and fitness book I have ever purchased, and I have bought a lot of them."
4,Functional exercise rocks!,I really noticed a huge improvement in my core strength after I started doing the exercises Martina suggests. I am a runner and competitive road cyclist and over the cycling season my core strength usually deteriorates. With these routines I definitely hope to maintain more of my core strength over the next season.
2,Yet another star tells us what to do,"I was looking forward to this book as Martina's story is a fascinating one, but the book didn't deliver what I expected. It is quite badly written and seems to jerk along from topic to topic. I didn't feel connected to the author in any way when reading it and it ended up being ""just another book about diet and exercise"" with nothing really new or inspiring."
4,A realistiv view to bettering one's own self,"I enjoyed Martina's book - she put into words what I couldn't. Her common sense makes it easy to understand why she is the professional that she is - it takes self-control and clarity of thinking to realize that it's not hard to have the shape you want - and thinking it, is what its all about - no need to kill yourself trying to get skinny - just go about your daily business and apply these methods in your normal daily thoughts and actions and you will be exactlly what you think you can be. Get to work and you will get what you put in to it. -Shape Your Self: My 6-Step Diet and Fitness Plan to Achieve the Best Shape of Your Life"
4,Insight into a Champion,"While Martina gives expansive -- and useful! advice on nutrition and fitness workouts, as a long-time avid tennis player I enjoyed the insight into her as a person. She includes vignettes of personal experiences over the years, which are wonderful for players who have followed her career since the days before she became a US Citizen. A really fun book!"
5,Was Recommended,"I haven't read the book as my daughter requested it for Christmas. It is larger and more substantial than I thought it would be by the photo, which makes it an impressive gift. My daughter wanted it because of an article she had read about the author. Apparently it is very inspiring and written to encourage women of all ages to get fit, in a no nonsense, easy to follow way. The author was (is) a women in her forties who shares her amazing story of being the oldest women to win a gold medal in tennis, I believe she was 43 at the time. I might be off a little on the facts as I recieved them second hand, but her feat is no less amazing. She is very fit and a good writer as well."
3,"Ok, but not very cheesy","Packaging is nice and they don't taste bad. They just don't taste good. I'll eat them cause I have several more boxes of them, but I won't buy them again. The shape is cute and maybe for a little kid they'd like them. I'm used to Nips and Cheese-its, so I may be a little biased. Over all I'd say that they are very bland."
4,The Most Useful Book!,"This book rocked! We made last-minute travel plans to Brussles with no idea of what we would find once we got there. The book contains practical and interesting walking tour maps of plenty of towns worth visiting. This came in quite handy when we began taking the trains throughout Benelux using Brussels as our hub.Of all the books we brought with us on the trip (Frommers, Fodor, Time Out and others), This book turned out to be the most useful of all and was the most dog-eared by the end of our two weeks.We only used one of the restaurant reccomendations -- no great shakes, but then again, that was not what the book was for."
4,A practical way to chart a course through the Benelux region,"This book can take the place of a tour guide, allowing you to chart your way through a day's touring and make sure you don't miss the high points"
1,Bad,"I ordered this product looking forward to the great reviews I had read about it. I get the package, open it, and it had exploded everywhere. It soaked the box it came in and the other products that were shipped with it. NOT HAPPY!"
5,Perfect Wedding Gift!,"I have given this little tray as part of wedding gifts for years now. I especially like the saying on this one. Itsends a special blessing for a special person on their big day! This year, I had trouble finding one. This tray exceeded expectations by arrivuing early! Great service!"
5,"From Destrehan, LA It is a great CD! Everyone should have!","The Artist playing guitar (Michael LoCoCo) is unbelievable, the effects are truly mind boggling. I plan to spread the word to others I know who would love it. I can't imagine anyone not loving it! Look forward to new stuff from Lococo.Sir Simoneaux"
4,A rewardiing read set in Liverpool in the 1930's,"This book written in 1931 should make the reader reflect on their own start in life. Set in Liverpool in a depressed time probably in the 1920's and not without fault this is a book which should have a wider readership.The book's notoriety is sadly a reflection of Political Correctness albeit a 1930's version of what is sexually acceptable in print. In the 21st C it is difficult to note which passages were not acceptable.James Hanley very realistically portrays an account of a boy (Arthur Fearon) who stows away with dreams of a new world. His decision to runaway results from his parent's decision that he give up his education to bring in much needed income, a dilemma not often faced today. To some the narrative may seem bleak but unlike most bleak narratives ""Boy"" is an inspiring read as it follows the struggles of an intelligent 13 year old boy yearning to be accepted in an unfriendly man's world but increasingly feeling isolated and friendless."
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!,Yes... VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! Can't think WHY it was ever banned ?!!! Don't bother! Wish I'd saved my money so don't waste yours!
3,A Slow Starter,"I really do love Dorothy Garlock and I have thoroughly enjoyed all of her books that I have read up to this one But More than Memory was a major dissappointment. First of all, the first 100 pages were just plain boring. I didn't really start to become even slightly interested in it until around page 130. I would have put it down and not finished it but I try really hard to finish every book I start. I thought the last 4th of the book was good, but as a whole it was unsatisfying. The 2 main characters, Nelda and Lute, are in constant battle and then suddenly they'll just have sex. The next thing you know, they're fighting. It's a constant circle that repeats itself. I would not recommend this book to anyone, Especially if you have never read a Dorothy Garlock book. Try Annie Lash, With Hope, or The Searching Hearts. These are a few of my Favorites!!"
4,Enjoyable book set in good ol' Iowa,I thought this was a nice read. I felt both characters were pretty endearing and enjoyed the side stories as well. I have to admit I did enjoy that the setting was in Iowa...my home state :)
2,Not Dorothy's Best,"I have read almost all of Ms. Garloch's stories and loved them. This is not her best. The storyline of Nelda and Lute was annoying and predictable. On again, off again. They were married years ago and seperated. She moved back to their hometown to sell her grandparent's farm. There they meet again and slept together, then fought. Very boring. I felt the main character, Nelda, had little compassion and did not truly love Lute for taking his words to heart as much as she did. I did not like her very much. She had witnessed the last concert of Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Richie Valens and it did not seem to affect her at all when they were tragically killed in a plane crash. She was too wrapped up in her own pity party to care. By the time I got to the end, I did not care whether they got together or not. I just wanted to read something else.I will continue to be a Garloch fan, but this one was a disappointment. Still, I urge you to read her other stories. They are awesome!"
2,"Predictable, Stupid Character","The thing I like most about this book was the dog. Nelda married Lute young because she got pregnant, but didn't tell him. Then they got divorced due to her father's demands and after eight years found him living next door to her grandparents' farm that she moved back to after they died. Guess what happens--it's very predictable and not very believable.Karen Arlettaz Zemek, Author of ""My Funny Dad, Harry"""
1,totally disappointed,"I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances."
1,Not Great Escapes,"I also read the book ""Who Goes Next"" that tells the true stories of daring escapes from prisons and prison camps throughout history, but this is not it. I ordered this book used and was disappointed to find it to be a 1960's detective/police novel. I would like to find the prison escape book."
3,You need to know about post-independence politics in Nigeria,"This was the first Wole Soyinka's book that I have read after the Man Died. While the Man Died won him a Nobel Prize in Literature, this novel is not far behind in it's literary composition.Soyinka did a brilliant job in this memoirs, at a young age of 28 yrs at the time the memoir covered, it goes to show that Soyinka was destined to be one of the greatest living souls of his time.If you want to know the thinking mind of one of the greatest dramtist of our time, this is a book you should not miss.Ibadan is the greatest city in Africa, and this book did great justice to it. (May, 1999)"
3,too brief,"I liked this book because of it's elegance and the fact that there are hardly any errors. But, I thought it expected the student to make too many assumptions in order to do the problems. This is frustrating for a first course (or any course) in electromagnetics when you're just gettting used to using vector calculus and are new to Maxwell's equations.Another problem I had is the lack of down-to-earth descriptions. To derive a formula and add one sentence at the end does not convey what is physically going on.I thought ""Fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics"" by Fawwz T. Ulaby was much more accessible for a first course in electromagnetics."
2,This book is no good,"It's a condenced version of another one of Mr. Cheng's books and every example has you flipping back and forth between 5 different pages no less then 10 pages apart. The ""Preface"" says, ""Much of the material has been adapted and reduced from my larger book, Field and Wave Electromagnetics..."" Examples do not explain the work, I found these reviews while looking for a substitute book to help me through this class."
4,The most complete book of electromagnetics I've ever read,"Being myself a undergraduate of electronic engineerings, I see this book as one of the most complete books that has ever got into my hands. Concise, full of examples, leaves you with thirst of going deeper into the topic."
2,Series in Decline,"I found watching 'The Ark' again quite sad. To me it illustrated how much the Doctor Who series under William Hartnell had declined, since its hey-deys in 1964 and 1965.The setting of the story was interesting enough, but somehow the episodes themselves just seemed to drag on. For me however, the worst aspect was the lack of interesting companions for the Doctor. Steven and Dodo were a poor substitute for Barbara and Ian. The actors themselves (Peter Purves and Jackie Lane) just seemed to lack the presence of their predecessors. Without an absorbing enemy to face, this Doctor Who story does not have enough to maintain the viewer's interest.For me the final negative was the use of the same sound effect within the Guardian hall on Refusis, as that used in the first ever Daleks episode. It just made the comparison more stark, that being one between a new and exciting series and one struggling to find its way."
2,So lost...,"...and it's not really anyone's fault. The only story you can purchase before this one is story 17, which leaves a whole season of information out. Like where is Vicki? Who is Dodo? And what happened to that part they stole from The Monk?It was just an okay episode. Like the part about how we need natural immunities. Contains episodes 26-29 of season 3. Again, the last DVD stops at season 2's episode 39."
2,Rough around the Edges,"As much as I like Doctor Who and William Hartnell, I still try to give my honest impression of the quality of the story. Unfortunately this one is not too gripping. The main let down is the Monoids. They just do not have a stong presence nor do they convey any real fear. Sometimes they speak like a normal person and other times their voice is modulated. Many small details are off which makes this appear more like a play and failed to make me believe in the adventure.The story creaps along at a very slow pace. Don't get me wrong I prefer slower paced stories when they are intellectual and provoke thought. I think it was an error to refer to the Monoids as Monoid 1, Monoid 2, Monoid 3 etc... That would work for Daleks or a race of Robots but the Monoids are suppose to be an alien race. There charactor was never developed and without a stong villian and not the best supporting acting this story feels flat."
3,"""Where did you get those stupid clothes?""","When I first viewed ""The Ark"" on a PBS station, I really didn't enjoy it much. But after purchasing the video, ""The Ark"" has amtured into a satisfying Hartnell outing. Dodo and Steven are a little silly sometimes, as the same with the guests(nice to see Michael Sheard). The Monoids aren't that bad, except the design in their feet or legs. And the Guardians' uniforms leave very little for the imagination. Although, the design is incredible for this era. Many different animals can be found in the forest section of the Ark(including an elephant!). The effects are pretty good. And the idea of returning to the Ark 700 years later is wonderful. It's nice to see a story set so far into the future(at least 10 miliion years), actually showing the earth being destroyed. Thumbs up!"
5,Doctor Who BBC restoration,The BBC is atoning for past sins (destroying so many Doctor Who episodes) by providing first-rate restorations of those surviving. The Ark looks good and includes a multitude of special features which illuminate the history and the making of the early Hartnell episodes. Highly recommended.
3,A classic that just falls a little short,"I always like watching the old Black & White episodes becuase it reminds me of when I was in High School, and first started watching Dr. Who-my parents tryed to stop me from watching it but I snuck an old portable B&W TV into an attic room and watched the old episodes. I liked this story except for a few things. First of all, as is the case with many early episodes, things have names that are too obvious. The planet they are escaping to is called Refusis (as in refuse) and the one eyed creatures are called monoids. The other problem I have is Dodo. She is just not a very good companion. Still the story held my attention and brought back fond memories of nights spent in an unair-conditioned room defing my parents to watch my favorite show."
5,Reality of WWI,"My Grandfather was with an Artillery Battery. A lot of what he described was the same as the memoirs in this book. He had 2 vivid memories one was the constant noise of the Artillery firing 24-7, and the other was 11-11-11 1918. His description was the knew the Armistace was scheduled to take effect but they were told the firing would probably taper off and stop but instead it was like somebody flipped a switch. At the exact time suddenly there was dead silence and it was over.EB Sledge wrote With The Old Breed about the Marine Infantryman in WWII and I think this is one of a few books which does the same for WWI."
3,real slow and less action then the rest of the movies,"THIS MOVIE IS TO SLOW AND DRAGGED OUT,NOT ENOUGH ACTION COMPAIRED TO THE REST OF THE TITLE MOVIES."
3,"Paramount,how about some extras please!","This is a good movie although the special effects are disappointing,especially the last shot of the Enterprise in the film which has a plastic look to it.Paramount,give us more extras please,such as-deleted scenes,how the special effects were done,interviews,the music soundtrack,production notes.For once Paramount,give fans their moneys worth."
2,Didn't like the Federation cast in the role of villain,"Gene Roddenberry had a vision of humanity that had overcome its worst tendencies, which is what makes the original, and to some extent the Next Generation, so appealing. When the writers of this movie decided that the villain should be someone approved of by the Federation, they subtley betrayed Gene's principles. Whether they created a good movie with that betrayal, judge for yourself."
2,and entry point and average trek film,"probablly one of the worst of the Star Trek film series thanks to a thin plot and flimsy direction. But the chrachters manage to keep it alfloat slightly, but like said before Im not crazy about the Next Generation cast.The film seesm standard Trek and jsut feels like a along episode. ITs watchable but hardly noteable"
2,Terrible.,"Let me start by stating that I am a die-hard Star Trek fan. But this movie was just...horrible. I don't know where to begin. I gave this movie two stars, one for the simple fact that this movie is Trek, and another for the superb acting. But regardless of the latter, this movie has nothing going for it. The story all together is terrible, and unrealistic. How come the Baku look EXACTLY like Humans? How come the planet looks EXACTLY like Earth (besides the fact that it was shot in the Canadian Rockies :)? This movie felt more like a mediocre episode than anything else. If you want to see a good Trek film, buy The Wrath of Khan or First Contact."
1,"When you rely on ""schtick"" to keep going...","...it's time to take a hard look at the franchise. Probably the most irksome characterization was that of Worf who has since his inception undergone a journey of self discovery, fallen hero, resurrected man of honor and now a foil for acne jokes in ""Insurrection."" For the next movie -- Deep Space Nine anyone?"
5,Star trek Insurrection,Excellent movie. Filled with all you would expect from Star Trek. All of the roles were laid out well and fun to watch.
5,It's like one bit fat sweet Next Gen episode,"It's like one bit fat sweet Next Gen episode with a much bigger budget, you'll love it. Just buy the video and see."
5,"I Don't know what everyone else is talking about, but this movie is great","I've been a Star Trek fan for a long time, and for the most part I agree with most people on the Trek movies. For instance, I think Nemesis, is horrible. But then I hear people saying this is a horrible movie. I have to disagree, this movie is great.One of the things that I love about Star Trek, is how the episodes are all about contempory and controversial issues, that is what this movie is all about, issues. Society at large in this movie have decided that they can take advantage of a civilization because it benefits them more than it benefits this group of people. This movie is much more complex than many of the older movies (and definitely more complex than the one movie that's newer).What makes any movie great? Issues that are covered in the movie that challenge society, I feel that this is something that's in any movie that is successful over the years, and this movie does that."
4,A spectacular sight yet lacking in story,"Star Trek Insurrection, the ninth movie in the Star trek movie franchise was eagerly anticipated by me. As a devoted Trek fan I of course liked it but was a little disappointed in the story. It seemed like a big bugeted TV episode and when you have to wait two years in between Star Trek The Next Generation appearences a glorified episode doesn't quite live up to par. On the other hand the special effects were incredible. With most of the SF shots being computer generated it was nice to see the reality that can be achieved (as you know, coming this summer, Lucas' Star Wars I is mainly digital too). Needless to say the Movie itself was entertaining and I'm sure that the average viewer will get a kick out of it. However, for us fans it fell a little short of the mark."
2,Slow movie it's the worst one.,I;m trying to watch this movie but can't stay interested. It's very slow with very little action 1 hour through I'm beginning to fall asleep. If you have insomnia try to watch this movie instead of taking a sleeping pill. No side effects and will do the job of a sleeping pill.
1,Paramount needs to seek out new life,"It timidly goes where the series has gone too many times before.At least #5 tried to push an envelope. It failed, but at least they tried. The creators of _Insurrection_, though, didn't even look for an envelope to push. The weakest of the bunch."
1,I've never seen such an awful flick,"I would have to describe Star Trek: Insurrection as THE Worst Film Of The Year.It SUCKED.People: I warn you, don't see it!!!, it'll be a waist of time and money."
2,Not much point,"This movie really should have been an episode in a series rather than a full-length movie. The plot was ok I guess, but I expect Star Trek movies to be a bit more eventful. Who cares what happens to 600 people who have lived the perfect life for 300 years already? There's a war on! What is the flagship of the Federation doing futzing around with the beautiful people? The good Star Trek movies have involed monumental events such as wars with Klingons and the Borg, potential destruction of Earth by alien probes and the death/rebirth of a main character. The war with the Dominion gave the writers a perfect opportunity to continue this tradition, but instead all they could come up with was a lame attempt to milk just a few bucks more out of the die-hard fans ...Sigh. I'm sure I'll buy it eventually anyway."
2,Meh,"There have been a lot of reviews that discuss the fascinating effect or wonder scene of importance, etc., so I won't rehash it all. Here's an easy way to decide if you want to own this film... ask yourself this question: ""Did I like Star Trek 4: Save The Whales?"" If the answer is yes, then you'll like this ST:TNG version of ST4:STW. If you found it intolerably preachy without enough of the reasons you watch a ST film (like I did), then this one will just piss you off (like ST4:STW did).There, I just saved you hours of reading other reviews. Thank me later."
4,Star Trek IX(Insurrection) is one of the BEST EVER!,"I've been watching Star Trek ever since I can remember, but THIS ONE has to be one of the BEST yet! Wonderful special effects, Frakes did a great directing job, and the story brings out some of the best aspects of the previous Star Trek films ACTION. If you're a DIEHARD Star Trek fan, or just a fan of the Next Generation characters, then this is deffently a must buy. If you're not that big of a Trek fan GET IT ANYWAY, or you'll really miss-out."
4,"Great Movie, but...","Star Trek: Insurrection is a great movie! I am a die-hard trekkie and I thought all the ST:TNG movies have been excellent. I think Insurrection was kind of not what I expected from the Star Trek creators. The third movie in the series could have been a lot better. The ""fountain of youth"" theme was kind of what I would expecet from an episode...not a movie. Other wise, the movie exceeded normal standards. The graphics were excellent and the cast acted very well. Star Trek: Insurrection is one movie that will be added to my relatively small video collection!Peter, 16"
3,The best of all Star Trek Movies,"I've panned everyone of the Star Trek Movies, because they were thoughtless and boring, but Star Trek: Insurrection is diffrent it has a better villian , better fight scenes, and more importantly good visual scenes, but it wasn't that good, but it does deserve a standing orvation."
5,"Insurrection, the best Trek film!!","I had seen this film only Yesterday, but immideatly I have understood that is the best. It contains all the caratteristics of the TNG serie and have a lot of humor, suspance, action and Trek. It's more than First Contact, which had nothing like Star Trek even if was a great adventure. Only one ""defaiance"": Picard is more like Kirk than himself, but for one time that's not bed..."
3,"Not the best , not the worst!","Well, What can you say? It takes two years to get a new star trek picture. I really love startrek and hope the next one will be better."
2,Star Trek Filler,"The Star Trek franchise has been rather successful and Paramount has done a good job(overall)with the Next Generation films thus far. However, ""Star Trek Insurrection""-DVD does not cut it.1. The DVD format/screen layouts and features are boring and unimaginative.0 out of 1 star2. The sound quality is average compared to other DVD's on the market. The DD format is fine ..but for a film like this -- DTS should have been used. The film transfer and visual quality top of the line 1 out of 2 stars3. The story is a typical Trek film with some great scenes. I got the feeling this film was put out to make sure we held on for the next great Trek film after First Contact. Thank you world for DVD Rentals. 1 out of 2 Stars"
3,Star Trek 101,"You loyalists will probably hate me for writting this but I think this is one of the weakest star trek movies ever made. What I mean is with the exception of Star Trek 5 the plot is the most poorly executed of all the Star Trek movies.Some parts were great,when Worf and Picard sang Gilbert and SulivanAs always, the space battlesThe Picard diplomacy tacticSome parts were badData and the childrenTori and Riker getting their hormones messed withPlease be kind to me, I just didn't like this movie all that much."
2,How to beat a dead horse.,"More of a TV episode than a regular movie, does not offer the moviegoer more that. Another exploitation of the Star Trek theme or how to beat a dead horse. The new Star Trek is minus the old cast and spirit and plus some who cares characters, the new technology and the preaching. Requires patience to watch."
1,Weak and Flacid,"This is definitely one of the weakest of the trek movies. I liked The Final Frontier (#5)better than this. Not enough here of the real Trek stuff that made the universe all that much better. Too bad too because Frakes has really resuscitated the trek movies better than LN ever did. Nimoy was good with #6 and Frakes with Contact. This just doesn't cut it. Oh well, that dasturdly odd number curse of the Trek Movies I'd say."
1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with this movie. This is worse than the 1st one: Star Trek The Movie. I saw this in the theatre and fell asleep before it was over. I am still ordering it because this will complete my collection of the Star Trek movies. I'll probably not watch it again.
1,Gooey and sickly sweet nonsense,"A tired story seen before in other sci-fi stuff like outer limits and twilight zone. Machines make mistakes; people are suspcious of the machine; want to get back to nature, but machine is providing the comfort of the good life. Machine falls, people awaken.... blah blah blah. I agree with the other reviewer - the Final Frontier was better and I hated that one. Bring on the big screen battle scenes, the Enterprise and running and jumping - yeah that's the trek I love. Skip this tape and see the Phantom Menace - that's got probs too but at least we have your gratuitous battle scenes and big box battleships."
2,Yawn Trek,"Repeat after me---Star Trek is NOT a comedy!Star Trek is NOT a musical!Star Trek is about exploring strange new worlds and exciting adventures...which this is NOT!An revengeful alien wants to remove some peaceable people from off ""his planet"".Not even F. Murray Abraham can save this movie!"
4,"Nice and light, humorous and comfortable","I agree with everyone else: What was Frakes thinking of with the Joystick maneuver? LAME! The rest of the movie did have an episodic feel, but I am comfortable with the characters so the movie did not feel overly long. Berman, et al needs to do something more with Dr. Crusher. In every movie she seems to have a bit part. Also, Gordie needs to loosen up, he always seems a bit stiff. As always, Stewart, Frakes and Spiner were exceptional. However, the women need more depth. I think McFadden can handle more than giving out a few hyposprays! I've been a Trek fan since I was a child. I'll always watch the new movies and am looking forward to a STTNG and DS9 combo."
4,Excellent Star Trek film - TV episode feel,"This film was critisised right from the start for being a long TV episode. To be honest, I don't care. Rather than the majority of Star Trek movies, which have a 'universe - threatening' feel, this kept it simple and enjoyable.First Contact was a better film, it has to be said, but this does not make this any less of a film than it was.True Star Trek fans will, of course, snap this film up. The general public will like it because of the TV episode feel, and all over it's only sufferance will be the complaints that it could have been shorter (hence a TV episode). I disagree. The film was enjoyable from start to finish, and has added to the rapidly improving quality of the ST film series.I won't be buying the video. But I'm going to catch it on rental, and also when it's on TV. Good fun for all the family (except the plastic surgery bits) - especially Troi and Riker getting a bit hot under the collar..."
2,Perhaps the concept is getting tired..,"One of the things that has always been a problem with Star Trek (all flavors) is the tendency to lower the plot level to elementary-school levels. One person is always good, another always bad. There's no grey area, and the good guy always vanquishes the bad guy, followed by a lecture from a social worker.The effects were good, as usual, though not spectacular. Maybe my standards are going up, but, I think this is the last Star Trek movie for me."
4,The Prime Directive.....,"Okay, this wasn't too bad. The plot is about the Prime Directive and what it means. Well, an alien force and certain Star Fleet members express interest in a planet with regenerative properties. Their interests violates Star Fleet's golden rule, ""The Prime Directive"". The Federation may not interfere in the development of other civilizations. Picard makes a very hard choice and go against Star Fleet's golden rule. Picard and his crew must protect and defend the planet. Even if it means the end of their careers at Star Fleet."
2,Shame on Paramount!,"When Paramount released the Director's Edition of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"" they showed an interest in giving fans a truly special and well crafted DVD. However, since II, they've gotten chintzier with each release. Now, Insurrection is packaged in a completely asinine case that literally has the two discs touching one another! It's bad enough that, editorially speaking, the Trek DVDs have gotten weaker with each release, but can't they at least continue to ship them in packages that promote the physical protection of the discs inside?"
3,Bland,"Although I consider this to be the worst of the Next Generation movies, I believe I'm giving it the same rating I gave First Contact, which I think is the best Next Generation movie.If this is true, then all of the Next Generation movies are pretty much the same. Indeed, I feel they are. They're all on par with what I would call an ""average"" episode of the series. For instance, I would call the episode Symbiosis average. This movie is like Symbiosis, except longer. I would give Symbiosis 3.5 stars, but I would give Insurrection 3, just because Insurrection is longer than it needs to be.The film isn't bad. I can't really identify anything bad about it. It's plot isn't bad or forgettable, the acting isn't bad, the atmosphere isn't bad. Nothing is bad. Everything just seems bland. I don't know why I didn't like it, but to me it just didn't stand out. I guess I was spoiled by some of the great episodes of the series that involve things like shifting time periods and dimensions."
3,A tolerable Trek entry,"Though this would have made a fine entry as an expanded TV ep, as a movie it feels somewhat flat (and puzzlingly so). Sound and visuals on the DVD are crisp and detailed. Oddly enough, there is a fight scene on the 'behind the scenes' disc involving Data in combat with the Ba'ku that was deleted - odd, because it's actually fairly good and would have probably improved the film on the whole. Definitely not a bad film just underwhelming. Also nice to see that F. Murray Abraham is still working since Amadeus and Last Action Hero."
5,Compelling?,"I am a British Viewer of Star Trek, and wish to write in defence of Star Trek: Insurrection. I know quite a lot of people who hugely dislike star trek, but when I introduce them to it, this is the film I show them first, I mean, okay First Contact is a great film for Trekkies and non-trekkies alike, but in Insurrection, you are subtly introduced to the charachters, which strangley I find, makes all of the previous films (TNG) more enjoyable. The story is a mixed affair, and alot of character relationships are explored. I find it thouroughly enjoyable and reccomend it to anyone, a Fan or Not."
3,An expensive episode,"It was easy to tell that during the seventh and final season of TNG that the series was winding down. The stories became a little bit more introspective and seemed to focus on a different character every week. This movie would have fit nicely in the seventh season. Basically a Picard episode with great special effects that really come to life with the 5.1 audio and Digital picture. Die hards will like it. Luke warm Trekkies won't, and if you don't like Star Trek - don't bother. I agree that bonus scenes and documentaries would make this a must have, but as is - it's a nice to have."
3,An Average Film.,"This was an average film on the whole. I don't believe it was as good as some of the other preceding Star Trek film. Not bad, but not great either."
4,A light adventure film with some food for thought.,"As a Star Trek fan I was curious about the so called curse of the odd numbered Treks. I think this one finally broke that. This film was everything one could expect from Star Trek. I liked that it was a light outing as the last one was intense. This one was like a taking a breather without compromising the series themes. The idea of slowing down, that each moment is a universe in itself appealed to my Zen sensibilities.We should take this to heart in our fast paced lifestyle with all its stresses and crisis. Once again Star Trek gives a message to our culture . Perhaps we should listen closer. A worthy entry in the series. I can't wait to see what lies ahead in this series."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,"The Son'a and the Federation Council are out to distroy a peacefull race called the Ba'ku. Only through insurrection can Jean-Luc picard and the Enterprise save the Ba'ku. Patrick Stewart is at his best. The movie is the first since Star Trek 4 to successfully have large ammounts of humor, and still lots of plot."
2,Star Trek Insurrection Collector's Edition,"I bought this movie believing I had never seen it, but it turns out I had watched the end half of it when it was on television. Imagine my surprise when I started getting deja vu! The plot of this movie was interesting, but it would have made for a better TV episode. The love story between the Baku woman and Picard would have been better left out of the film. It was interesting that the two races wound up being the same, though. The story was decent, the movie itself followed Star Trek: TNG's usual stories, but just not a good plot choice for a feature length film. There wasn't really enough action for me. I'm not an expert movie critic, just my opinion."
3,"Better than ""Nemesis""","I think that this movie had better writing, acting, and directing than ""Nemesis"". You can tell that Star Trek was starting to falter when this movie came out."
4,A Good ST:TNG Episode,"This is a good Star Trek _episode_, meaning it would fit in very well as an episode of the tv series. It's not as flashy or dramatic as most of the movies, however. The story leans more toward the characters and their inter-relationships than toward big space battles. It's a movie for the long-term TNG fan, not the casual SF action movie fan. The story isn't terribly memorable, but does have some very nice character-developing moments for the Enterprise regulars. Worth watching and no where near living up to the ""odd-numbered movie"" curse!"
2,Well....um.....Okay!,"Insurreection for lacks two things:1) An interesting story and,2) A convincing enemy. F. Murray Abhram is a great actor, but this role, couple with his ""holding back"" may have made this movie fall a little short.Again the film is filled with cute scenes and certain actions that interesting. But overall, the director (Johnathan Frakes again (Commander WIlliam Riker) didn't seem to have as much fun in this one.The most ridiculous thing in it was that in the 24th century when you have a spaceship that is five football fields in length and the size of New York, is that your steering apparatus for this gigantic ship is a JOYSTICK! Yiches!Anyway, after you buy all the other films, this is the second to last to by of the Star Trek movies. (The last being ""Star Trek V:The Final Frontier"")Hopefully movie number 10 (Due out in fall 2002.) will be much better. Take a chance on this one."
3,It could be worse!,"Star Trek: Insurrection my not be the best Star Trek movie made but it is definitely not the worst (can you say Star Trek V: The Final Frontier). As for as the story goes it is a great story and it definitely has a lot of humor, which it always a good thing. So if you love Star Trek in any form buy this movie."
3,Not of galatic proportions.,"The movie was a two hour Star Trek The Next Generation television episode. It was nice getting together with our old friends from NCC-1701-D. Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard) was again exceptional. Please kill off Counselor Troi (What is her reason for being?) Data was also exceptional. Jordi was refreshing as was Riker. I think that guiding the E Model of the Enterprise with a ""Joystick"" was a bit over the edge (What were they thinking of except maybe for the comic relief?) Overall the Enterprise and her crew are exceptional and I also would like to see Q as the bad boy again. The special effects were not up to Star Trek standards, not even Star Wars standards. I will purchase the video for my collection."
2,Reminds Me Of Generations (ST 7),"Okay was I the only one who felt like they were watching Generations all over again? What did Paramount do recycle from that movie into this one? Where is all the villians we've come to know and love? I mean they got First Contact right with the Borg. (A Favorite among us Star Trek fans). Why couldn't they get it right the second time around? Well it is an odd trek film and for some reason odd number films don't seem to do well. But still no excuse.It seems though that the cast will wait three years before making the next trek film. They have reportdly stated it will be their last and pick up from where Insurrection left off. My advice: If the next film will be your last why not have Q as the villian? I mean after all, hes one of our favorite characters and has been with ST since TNG came on the air. And still makes appearences on Voyager."
2,Less than Average Trek,Nothing worth commenting on here.Below average effort.Dumb.Was this written by Forest Gump?
2,Would've made a better tv episode,"The special effects are acceptable. The acting top notch. The story line is good though the plot somewhat weak. This would have made a much better tv episode or made for tv movie than a theatrical release. I feel this movie doesn't know what it wants to be--a love story, an action/adventure, a drama, a comedy. It tries its hand on all the elements yet comes up short. It's a good effort that just doesn't pay off at the end. It's one of the weaker movies in the series, but still enjoyable enough to watch on a Saturday night with the family."
1,So forgettable I actually forgot it once.,"This film is actually worse than most episodes of the Next Generation. It might give the die hard trekkers who don't care about plot or logic something to guffaw at with its nearly soap opera qualities, but those of us who actually can remember when a star trek movie was a good movie and not just a good inside joke yearn for better than this. Along with Generations, it consitutes the worst Trek film yet."
1,"Are you kidding me? No, Trekkers won't swallow everything!","The ""mighter-than-thou"" crew of the USS Enterprise decide that they know better than the entire Federation Council (including the Vulcans) and override the decision to remove the _non-native_ Ba'ku from their _non-native_ planet. Humph! The audacity of the Council! Remove these handful of vagabonds so that the planet can be used to save the lives of wounded Federation defenders from a genocidal race that wishes the erratication of all Alpha-Quadrant beings?? Ridiculous!! Now, let's have cheesy love scenes, crappy special effects and a horrendously CGI-rendered Enterprise-E debut and call it a Trek movie!!Rent this movie for 99 cents...DON'T buy it."
2,please some one save Star Trek!!,"I have allways loved Star Trek ,but this one I am sure can't be a real Star Trek movie it must be a fake made by satan to torture us trekies . Or Maybe the ""Q"" had something to do with this movie,Because it's bad ,simply put. If you doubt my review than rent it or just watch it.. one of 20 times a day its on cable . However one redeaming quality of this movie is that Star Trek X has got a good shot at being a better movie than the previous film. One way to improve on the movie would be to have Mystery Science Thearter 3000 Have go at it."
3,It was much better then Cat's I will see it again and again.,I loved it much better then Cat's I'll see it again and again
3,"Humorous, action filled, light-hearted, filled with effects.",It's a good addition to the venerable Star Trek family of films. Not every film should be about a terrible battle with the borg. It was nice to see love blooming in the stars and humor finding its way back into our heros' hearts.
4,"Good, but not the best","Like most of the StarTreck movies, it was good, but compared to others, the storyline was just a little strange."
2,Not to great,I think it was okay but no where near worth $88. I say the heck with buying it until I can get it preowned for $9.99
3,amazon.com said it best....,"Adequate. Nothing more. The film's humor saves the film, and so do the acting and interplay between the characters. BUT... the story is predictable, and quite frankly a snoozer!!"
2,Would have made a good 2 part TV show.,"If you are a trekie, you must see it (of course). But this is not movie class stuff. It's all about a single planet. No saving the Universe. The Enterprise gets attacked and they run! The impulse engines are over worked, and smoke! Picard learns a new trick. He can effect time, or slow down things around him. Maybe he himself speeds up. This new talent is not used. At one point the crew are shooting down small objects, lots of them. This is when Picard should have used his new skill. He could have made Data look bad buy firing 10 times per second, then Data could have said ""How the hell?"" or something. This new trick does seem stupid, I wish it was not in the movie. Anyway, this movie would have been a good NG TV show!Treker"
2,Good Movie,"This was a good movie. Not as great as its predecessor Star Trek: First Contact, but has great f/x, and an ok story line. It was time for the producers to add some light comedy to a series that has had 2 previous movies that had a serious undertone to them. I enjoyed it this movie a lot. It also helped to explore the Picard and Data more fully since First Contact. It also showed that Picard has a human heart afterall. It was funny and intense at the same time."
2,"How did this insult to ""Star Trek"" fans happen?","Michael Piller should publicly apologize for everyone to developing the story for this film. It's nothing more than an ill-fated attempt to apologize for all the war-like stuff we were seeing in DS9 at the time of this film's emergence. I was actually offended by this movie, as though Paramount was talking out of both sides of its mouth. Worse yet was the way the advertised this movie as ""action-packed,"" which it most certainly is not. What happened to the drama? This movie doesn't even have a happy ending, it has a sappy ending! The Enterprise and her crew don't have to blow something up every five minutes, not by a long shot. That's not what ""Trek"" is really about. ""Star Trek V"" pulled off a much better show, compensating for a weak plot with some great moments between the characters. ""Insurrection"" offered even little of that, and as far as I'm concerned, we haven't had a real Trek movie since '96."
4,Good Film,"Over all ""Star Trek: Insurrection""was a good film. It had everything I look for in a good story; plot twists, humor a little romance and a fair amount of action. It wasn't quite as good as ""Star Trek: First Contact"" But then, that is a tough act to follow."
2,Insurrection could've shined but stumbles.,"Insurrection begins with a supurb teaser opening with Data running amuck on the peaceful Baku planet. Downhill from there. While trying to maintain ultimate 'cuteness', this film becomes silly and unfulfilling. Frakes decides to deep six the starship models and opts for CGI only - and it shows. When I saw this movie in the theater I thought the Enterprise looked fuzzy because of the screen I saw it on (although it was at Mann's Chinese theater in Hollywood!). Upon DVD viewing I saw that all the starship shots are fuzzy because of the CGI rendering. They almost look video game-ish. Nothing, plot-wise, is taken to fruition, except the warmed up left-over we've eaten once before - the bad guy gets blown up in the end. Stewart and co-stars are capable of so much more - let's hope the next time the crew dons their space tights they become three dimensional characters that are actually headed somewhere."
2,what were they thinking???....,"When i heard this film was gonna be more funny and lighthearted the last one i thought it would be awful and i was right.Star trek films are better when they have a darker tone eg: ST2, ST6 and first cantact , when will they realise that??"
5,Great movie....,"This movie was great, not the best in the series, but a great movie by its self, excellent story ans casting and special effects....Great job ParamountThe only problem I had was with the little 10-minute behind the scenes featurette, i mean come on, a little bit more please!! For those of you who don't know this is the same featurette that was and probably still is on the STInsurrection website, paramount didn't really put any effort into this."
3,Entertaining...to a degree.,"Not the best of TNG movies by far, this one is never the less entertaining. More like an episode of the series than an actual motion picture, I personally believe the script should be blamed as the director, Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker himself) did an amazingly wonderful job on the previous entry in the series, Star Trek: First Contact. The film suffers from a lack of a significant and powerful villain. Never the less, there's a lot of fun to be had here. The crew seems more like a family again."
5,BREATH TAKING!,"Ok, this is short, sweet and to the point.Startrek Insurection is the BEST of all of them (IMO) it's incredible, ok it's not action all the way like Startrek II: The Wrath of Kahn or First Contact. But it has a story, it falls in line with the Startrek episodes that were made at that time and it is funny!!! Yes, there are a number of one liners in there as well!You may not agree with me, but I don't care. It's Startrek, it's a fime. And it's the best, if you havn't seen it (And I will want to know why not!) go an watch it. If you have seen it, WATCH IT AGAIN!!!! :-)"
2,Not what i expected from paramount pictures!!,"If your a true trekie you will still like this film im sure, but this movie doesnt live up to the movie before this one First Contact, but in general it is a good movie, it has its ups and downs, i was hoping to see more of the enterprise E in action but im sure in time we will all get to see more of it, i hope. If you consider yourself a true star trek fan then do your self a favor and buy it now!!!"
4,Good but not the best,"At first I was thrilled. Second viewing, I was a bit disappointed. After all, the movie does not have the physical threat to the human race that many other ST movies have had. Yet it had a grace, great special effects, and good humor. And the ""threat"" was just as real. I imagine one of the reasons it didn't do as well in the box office is that it didn't attract as many younger viewers.But if you're looking for a night of fun, this is a great movie. The scenery is awesome, the acting is well crafted, and this is one you don't want to miss."
2,What Happened?!?,"This by far, has to be the worst Star Trek Movie made, even worse than ST5. The one thing it did do for me though, was to increase my appreciation for the plights of DS9 and Voyager's crews. I mean think about it, while the enterprise crew is entertaining diplomatic guests and enjoying their newfound youth, DS9's crew was on the frontlines in the war against the Dominion and Voyager's crew, perpetually alone in the Delta quadrant, was fighting off the borg and species 84...whatever. This should've been a movie showing the enterprise E's prowess in battle and involve the Federations war against the dominion. It was almost like the enterprise was in an alternate universe for crying out loud!!!"
1,Worf with a pimple?,"There were too many ""cutesy"" things in this movie. Riker being shaved by Troi? Trying to play footsey on her couch? Really!! How come Picard never gets the girl? Any female that shows him any attraction he rejects harshly! Maybe Picard has been in space too long. Data singing? This was hard to image him doing.Worf with a pimple? Worf being a warrior would rather kill himself then show this ""childish"" side of himself. The most absurd part was Riker steering the Enterprise with a ""joy stick""! Surely Star Fleet Engineers could come up with something more dignified. A ""Nintendo"" Enterprise!! What will they think of next?My kids were delighted to think Nintendo would be around in the 24th century!!"
1,Worest Star Trek Movie,"Insurrection was the worest movie over Star trek. What i liked about Star trek, It was the peaceful exploration mission Enterprise crew do. That's what Star trek is all about and thats what Gene would have wanted it. Leave the fighting to Star Wars, Star Trek is peaceful. I feel Star trek is dieing out so start collecting. They ruined the chance to make DS9 Movies by splitting crew up at the end. I hated it when they took Star trek themes out of the shows. ""...To Boldly Go Where No man Has gone before"" Gene would not be happy."
1,Worst Star Trek Movie,"This is by far the worst Star Trek movie ever made. TNG made plenty of bad movies and this one is no exception. First off, this does not even feel like a movie. Instead, it feels like a two-part TNG episode. So instead of watching this disgrace, watch any two-part TNG episode because it will be better. Many minor characters were given lame lines just to give them screen time."
1,this is the worst Star Trek movie EVER,"I wish that you could give no stars. This movie is exactly what is wrong with Star Trek. No plot, just an excuse for location shooting. No character buildup, you are expected to believe that picard would just leave Starfleet without a fight. He takes everything at Adm. Dougherty's word. Maybe he should check it out with hq? No, being to bootlicker that picard is, he just takes authority's word on it. Kirk would have had the guts to find out on his own. Now that the bald frenchman's fans are mad, Stewart's performance seems like he's sleepwalking through it. Like it's giving him a check, but little else. Maybe it's time to retire the TNG crew, unless paramount can do better than this dreck. Where's the Final Frontier when you need it? Unimspired script, lackluster performances, stupid excuses to make fun of characters, I think frakes (riker)does not like Micheal Dorn (Worf)."
4,Zion like community and values,"The show is better with repeated viewings... It successfully shows a Zion like community and perhaps all that idealism is reflected in Picard where he deals with an issue that's just as pertinent as survival, how we use our power."
2,"Been there, seen that","This is really a TV movie which doesn't have a story to tell. The ""exploitation of the fountain of youth"" plot was one of the weaker ones from the original series (""Omega Glory""), so it's surprising that the producers would choose to recycle it for a movie. The writers attempt to comment on America's ""forced relocation"" of Japanese Americans during World War 2, but it comes across as forced and awkward in this setting. The love story between the Baku woman and Picard is about as romantic as stale toast. Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham is totally wasted as a villain with some major skin problems. Troy and Riker get to play on the set rather than act. As usual, Data saves the day with some funny lines, but it's not enough to save this ill-conceived project. Disappointing after the fun and adventure of ""First Contact."""
4,"Insurrection, ODD-ly good.","An odd numbered Trek, it's supposed to be bad. But surprisingly it isn't, I found myself enjoying this one alot more than any other odd numbered Trek, and a few even ones. I think it's an admirable addition to the impressive Star Trek franchise and sci-fi all together."
2,Eyes Treked Shut,"This is by far the weakestStar Trek movie.Exceptionalspecial effects only help somuch,the story is a bore.Thebig moral question here is: ifit's wrong should we rebel orjust go along with the crowd.The last two Star Trek moviesfeaturing the Next Generationcast were so very good,thisone is a crash landing.Eventrekers and trekies are likelyto be disappoited by this one.Most two-parters from theTV series beat this dog.GALAXY QUEST the knock-off ofSTAR TREK puts this movie toshame! See it instead. I knowtrekaholics will have to seefor theirselves.Let's hopethere's something worthwhile left in the universe for thecrew of the Enterprise to filmnext,'cause I really like STAR TREK!"
3,"Craftmanship - yes, Great sci-fi - NO !","Well, Insurrection is coming to DVD in May, usually it takes 6 months after release to go to video - this must mean this film did terrible in the box office. Jonathan Frakes in an interview said he put less time into this film than in FC so that he could be with his family more, well it shows. And as for Rick Berman, all I can say is that I wish he would spend ALL of his time with his family and let someone else with more imagination and daring take over the Star Trek franchise. And that's all I have to say about that!"
3,The plot doesn't have the Star Trek feel.,"Burried beneath great special effects, the plot comes out as being pretty exciting. I've got to tell you, this movie didn't give me that feel you get - the one that makes you say, ""I must be watching Star Trek."" Call me crazy, but Generations, and First Contact, both gave me that feeling; Insurrection just lacked that enthusiasm. I'm hoping for a better movie in Star Trek X."
5,insurrection,"This is THE Star Trek movie. If you dont know Star Trek, You must see this one. It has it all. The best movie ever."
4,"This Movie has Humor, and it has A PUNCH TO IT!!","This Movie has it all, Humor,action,drama,and a GREAT plot. Yes all trekers will love this, but the average movie goer will also enjoy this movie. This is a movie for the WHOLE family. THE PLOT: Captain Picard (Stewart) and his crew up for another movie (the Third one) the main plot is Data (Brent Spiner) the andirod shorts a circut while on a top secret mission he becomes damaged. So the Enterprise goes to investigate, when they recover Data (Spiner) they go to the suface to invatigate why Data goes crazy, they find a HOLO SHIP in the middle of the lake LOOKING exactly like the Village of the B'ako. The Sona and the Federation want the B'akos planet because it is the long lost FOUNTAIN of YOUTH. And the rest of the movie, the rest of the movie is, well you will just have to watch it for yourself. JUST remember it is the BEST STAR TREK MOVIE YET.GREAT ACTION GREAT PLOT GREAT HUMOR and great MOVIE"
2,This isn't Star Trek material,"This movie was so bad compared to other Star Trek movies. This is why people look at Star Trek and call it boring. They try to mix romance with science fiction and it DON'T WORK! If you want a good Star Trek movie, go buy one of the first eight(except for the final frontier)."
4,Exceptional Trek,"I think most people didn't get this movie because they were expecting something else. Get over it! No Shatner! (Read his books! He saves the day!) No Borg! (Watch Voyager!) Its a much more subtle Star Trek picture that even the TNG series has done in various pictures, but that isn't the point. If you take the time and listen to what everyone is saying, you'll realize why Patrick Stewart doesn't have to repeat his ready-room rant from the last film to nonetheless give another stellar performance, among other things. The humor is well-placed and the action scenes are fantastic. Just give it another try with a more open mind. Then you'll see."
4,It's ok.,"I just watched this movie, and when my wife asked me if I liked it, I didn't know what to say. The special effects are good, the acting is fine, but this movie just didn't grab me. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it, but it seems like the story is too small for a movie. The whole premise seems a little weak and then there's all the usual ""save the day"" tactics with no surprises.It's not so much that this is a bad Star Trek movie, but that I was hoping for a lot more. If they took this back to the cutting room and remove 40 minutes they could make one of the all time best TV shows. Instead, you have a movie which lies somewhere in the middle of all Trek films.If you're just going to buy one, I'd get the Wrath of Khan. If you've already got a few, this isn't a bad one to add to your collection."
4,Not as good as First Contact but still great,"When I first saw Insurrection, I had high hopes for it. When I left the theatre, I wasn't disappointed. Sure, there isn't a lot of action in this one like there was in First Contact, but it is still a great movie. My favorite scene is where Geordi, with his newly regenerated eyes, is seeing a sunrise for the first time. I am legally blind, and this scene was a very touching moment for me. The DVD is great, but the only downside is the lack of extras. The only extras are the two trailers and a short behind the scenes bit. I would have liked more, which is the only reason I did not give 5 stars. Other than the lack of extras, this is a great addition to the Star Trek universe."
3,"So much potential, so little punch","While this latest installment of the Star Trek franchise was certainly entertaining and fun it left me wanting more. A lot more. Supposedly there is a desperate war being waged between the Federation and the Dominion, yet the Federation's flagship is out picking flowers and dancing through the tulips with 300 year-old hippies. Forgive me if I don't shed too many tears for these happy folk, who have already managed to leech off Utopia for centuries while Starfleet is going 15 rounds for their freedom.There's nothing really wrong with the movie itself. It's lighthearted, fast-paced and exciting. But for those who follow the Star Trek universe this movie falls very short."
4,StarTrek Insurection,All in all it was a good film. However it was not near on the scale of Generations. It lacks the Action given in other Star Trek movies
3,"Good movie, disappointed with special edition","I have been excited about most of the special edition releases of the Star Trek films and was hoping to see much more on this one than I did. I still like the story and the movie. The text commentary by Okuda is wonderful as always. But there really isn't much more to this version than the previous release of it. The first release had digital 5.1 and widescreen and a behind the scenes documentary. The special edition has all that, DTS, the text commentary, and subtitles, as well as background featurettes that aren't all that inspiring to watch. I was disappointed to see no deleted scenes or a audio commentary by the director or any of the actors. If you are a fan you probably already bought this. If not and you are happy with the original release, save your money or wait till you can buy this used. If you need the subtitles (I never understand why any dvd would be without them) or DTS mix then maybe this is worth it to you."
2,What happened to Star Trek?,"I havent been keeping up with the most recent Star Trek movies so I decided to rent the most recent one, Star Trek: Insurection. Though it had its moments, I thought the movie was stupid. It just didn't have the Star Trek magic of the eariler movies. It seemed like a long episode rather than a movie. I just hope that Star Trek 10 will be lots better."
3,An underrated Star Trek film.,"I enjoyed this underrated Star Trek film that improves with repeat viewing.It has the largest outdoor set ever built for a Star Trek movie and also has more outdoor scenes,and extras, than any other ST film.It has some very big outdoor scenes and the photography,with the mountains in the background,is spectacular.The special effects are disappointing because ILM was replaced by a cheaper firm which was a big mistake on the makers part.The film does have some good action scenes,although I would have prefered that the Enterprise ""fire the photons""at the villians in a battle rather than release explosive gas,which was the weakest part of the film.Fans would prefer a bigger battle and this was an opportunity missed.But overall a good story and a rousing adventure."
4,"A special Trek film, I love it!","Insurrection is not the best of all Trek movies, but also not the wrost one. I think it is the most beautiful Star Trek movie than ever made. When I saw this movie at theater first time, I have a terrible feeling. Because it doesn't look good as First Contact. Then I watched it again with VHS version, my feeling have changed and I find out myself really love this film. Although the storyline is not epic, and I really like the scenes that Enterprise-E fight with Son'a warships. It remind me THE WRATH OF KHAN. I comment if there are one or more TNG movies, they should direct by Jonathan Frakes. Because he is the best STAR TREK movie Director."
2,Its OK,"I was very disappointed the first time I saw this movie in the theater...but upon further viewing on DVD, it wasn't that bad. I was really trying to like it as I was watching it...until Riker takes manual control of the Enterprise with a mid-90s JOYSTICK that pops out of the floor!! I subtracted one star just for that!"
1,Worst trek film ever,"Without a doubt the worst Trek fims ever made, This movie and Nemesis practically killed the Star Trek movie franchise.While I may buy this to complete my collection I would not recommend even renting it, let alone buying this film.Try ANY of the other Trek films instead."
1,Very Pedestrian and Even Wrong-headed!,"A very boring installment in the franchise, as my date actually feel asleep during the movie. Would have made a decent 2-part episode of the series but as a feature movie it was a big disappointment. Also, I was not convinced by Picard's argument. I don't know... moving 600 people so countless billions in the galaxy can be saved by a new medical technology... sounds like a compelling reason to me. Very weak plot and the joystick control on the Enterprise to boot, just made it a bad, bad movie... time to put the Trek franchise to rest I'm afraid..."
2,MAKE THE NEXT ONE LIKE THE FOLLOWING ANIMATED FILM:,"TEH SECRET OF NIMH- THEN YOU CAN BOAST ABOUT IT ALL YOU WANT SINCE THAT FILM IS EASILY THE GREATEST ANIMATED FILM EVER THANKS TO INGENIOUS STORY WRITING AND A UNLIMITED SPECIAL EFFECTS BUDGET. CONSIDERING IT WAS MADE IN 1982(THE YEAR OF THE GREAT FILMS-BLADERUNNER, TREK 2, ET, NIMH) IT WAS MADE LOOKING AS IF IT COULD BE PASSED OFF FOR 1992. AND KNOWING PARAMOUNT, THEYD MAKE A TREK FILM USING NIMH 2 AS A ROLE MODEL WHICH OF COURSE WAS THE WORST SEQUEL AND FILM EVER! BUT WHY WOULD THAT COME AS NO SURPRISE???"
3,PARAMOUNT HAS FAILED-ITS TIME FOR FOX TO BUY TREK,"PARAMOUNT HAS FINALLY FAILED MISERLY CUTTING BACK TREMENDOUSLY ON BUDGETS AND IT NOW APPEARS THAT ALL CHARACTERS FROM THE CURRENT SERIES WILL NO LONGER HAVE ANY ROLES IN THE LAST TREK FEATURE COMING OUT IN LATE 2001. PARAMOUNT INTENDS ON RUINING TREK WITH A ""LOW BUDGET "" WING COMMADER SERIES AND MOVIE BASED UPON STARFLEET ACADEMY. THIS WILL NO DOUBT BE THE FINAL FAILURE FOR THE DYING FRANCHISE. FOX CAN SAVE THIS EPIC BY BUYING IT OUT AND GIVE US WHAT WE REALLY WANT-- A GREATLY WRITTEN ACTION-PACKED BLOCKBUSTER, SOMETHING PARAMOUNT COULDNT EVEN DO WITH FIRST CONTACT AND KEEP EVERY WRITER/DIRECTOR/PRODUCER EVER ASSOCIATED WITH TREK AWAY FROM IT (EXCEPT FOR IRA STEPHEN BEHR WHO GAVE US THE IMPROVED DS9 WITH THE DOMINION WAR-TO BEHR, THANKS A LOT!)."
1,"a complete bore ...almost, very dull, no tactics or strat.,","This is not a ""Wrath of Khan"" episode, It's oh so ""soap opera-ish"" and prdictable. A lil glamor but falls short of military tactics that made Star Trek famous. It's for the ""socker mom"" type. Not a real ""man type"" movie. This was kiddie fare stuff, nothing but wimpy crying men scared to excercise their machoism. It lacked adventure and mystery. They spent more time looking at their hand-held ""tri-corders"" than they did observing what they had to do, I don't see how they got where they were going. One redeeming value though, the movie wasn't all that ""cartoonish"". i.e. Star Wars. And I haven't seen Star Wars yet which have become just another yawn, ya see all that on ""DOOM 2, & QUEST 1,2,& 3."
1,Shaving Ryker's Beard,"I watched this movie recently on Netflix and it's easy to tell why it failed. You've got a franchise premise that enables you to explore new worlds and seek out new life, so what do you do? The aliens look like humans, the surface of their world looks like Earth.There was an episode of Mystery Science Theater, where the mad scientist provided Joel with a one-word movie review: ""Climbing."" I can't tell you the secret recipe for a successful movie, else I would be writing movie scripts instead of Amazon reviews, but I can tell you this much: If you want your movie to be popular at the box office, don't go overboard on the climbing."
1,Movie? What movie?!,"According to the reseller, the movie was ""sold in the store"" before my order arrived. :-("
3,I GOT A COPY OF THIS ON JUNE 1st!!!,"Don't ask me why my local store had this on the shelf, but here's a brief review. I've also been buying all the ""Special Editions"" of the Star Trek movies, and this one is a bit disappointing. The two biggest are: 1.) ABSOLUTELY NO AUDIO COMMENTARY! Why, Why,Why?? Frakes did First Contact why not this one? It is his film. 2.) The menu is hard to use with the colours that indicate your movement.That being said, if you are collecting like I am, buy it now. If you are expecting some insight from the director, skip it. Now the positives: 1.) Disk 2s extras have Deleted Scenes that will make you wish they put them back in the film for this DVD. 2.) Oluda's text commentary is always nice and sometimes funny. 3.) Star Trek's women short doc. was a nice bonus.I only had a two hours to play with DVDs, so you may find some hidden features I haven't found yet.LIVE LONG AND PROSPER---J.C."
3,"If you liked Star Trek 5, this movie is for you!","Actually, it's a lot better than Star Trek 5, but it still suffers from ""Odd Numbered Star Trek Movie Syndrome."" For all that, it's one of the better odd numbered ST movies. It has a few cute scenes and a few not-so-cute scenes, and at least represents the first Star Trek DVD I've seen that has some decent extras on it."
5,Incredible!,"I loved the ""Imzadi"" scenes and how they softened Picard's demeanor. I don't think they used enough of the whole crew that we're used to seeing, or the battle scenes, but the special effects and stunts (costumes, etc.) were awesome!!!"
2,Slow with a few enjoyable scenes!,"I am a Star Trek Fan, however, this movie lacked energy. As with Star Trek 1,3,5 and now Insurrection the Movie was slow, even boring at times. The only thing keeping it from getting one star was the great special effects and a few really great scenes. I would rent this one!"
3,"Was it one of the ordinary two episodes TV series, or what?","As a trekky from outside the US, the only thing I enjoyed much during the movie was to see old friends; Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Geordi, Diana, and Doc, together. It was really like one of the ordinary two episodes TV series, nothing else."
3,New Age Trek Fest 99',"Not every day do I catch myself shedding a tear for Star Trek, but I couldn't help it. I bet you know which scene I cried at...it was the scene with Data on the mountain top talking about....breasts?! Of course, I was laughing so HARD I cried, I still did cry. Other than that, this trek adventure was fun. It had something that trek has never really covered though--emotion. When I speak of emotion, I am talking about Picard. I'd never really seen him so...uhhh...what's the word...ahh, mushy. Well anyway, I couldn't help but like the films goffiness. The team over at Trek studios worked real hard for this one and they failed...but still this trek does have one good thing to say for itself. It is the BEST of the worst! That truly is something, now isn't it."
5,fun,"I am a big star trek fan, but not all of the movies were as fun as this. I liked the beginning the best because Data kicks butt. It had some of that classic trek flavor but with all the effects we have come to expect from the new series. I hope the next movie ties in the cool stuff thats been going on with DS9 the last few seasons."
1,After-market batteries -- cheap and unreliable,Always keep in mind that the difference between a GENUINE Canon battery and el-cheapo GENERIC battery is HUGE.Currently the cheapest you can get the genuine battery for is $40 USD. Anything less than that is after-market stuff.I am surprised people expect good performance out of $7 battery. Of course it dies quickly! Of course you cannot expect it is going to last! Let along the risk of frying camera electronics because of fluctuations in the battery power and specs.Do yourself a favor and always use genuine manufacturer accesories for your digital camera.
3,"Pricey, but necessary!","... the NB-1L is ridiculously high priced, but you will definitely want to buy one if you do any amount of photography with your Digital Elph S100!"
4,whiny little guy,"this battery provides a good amount of power considering its rather small size. however, when being charged, the battery produces an easily audible whine. At least you'll know it's done charging once the whining noise is gone."
3,doesn't last long,You have to get an extra battery so you'll have a spare. It just stinks you have to pay that much for a stupid battery that doesn't even last 30 minutes most of the time.
1,Canon Elph Batteries,"Like a previous review, I also bought an extra battery for my digital Canon Elph... and am very (VERY) disgusted at how quickly they lose their charge. A few photos and the low battery lights up...a few more photos and the battery is totally useless. The photo quality is fine...but why did I bother to buy a larger memory card when I only get four shots (if that) on a battery? I wouldn't buy one again...and am considering replacing the entire camera due to the battery situation."
4,Must have for Canon S100 owners.,"This battery lasts about 20 shots with the Canon S100, if you're lucky. You simply have to buy a backup battery if you want to do some serious photo taking. It's a bit pricey, but since no other battery fits the S100, Canon can charge whatever they want. It does a full recharge in about 2 hours and doesn't seem to have a ""memory effect"" with constant charge and recharge. If the price was less I'll give it 5 stars."
5,A must have accessory !!!,"An extra battery is a must for any of the Canon Powershot Elph cameras. This one would work for S100, S110, S200, S300 or S330.A newer version of this one is NB-1lH with 840 mAh rating. Which is 25% more capactiy than the NB-1L model which had 680 mAh rating. The newer one is included with S200 and S330 cameras.So when buying the extra one, try to get the newer version. Some marketplace sellers have it here on Amazon also.As for the working of battery its flawless. And its so light weight and small that it can be easily carried in any camera bag. And the small size means its also easy to loose it, so watch out !"
5,Don't leave home without it,"The battery charges quickly and is compact. It is indispensible because the camera batteries quickly die after the low battery indicator lights up. It fits easily with a spare compact flash card into the soft case, both of which I also highly recommend."
3,Conceptual color eye-opener,"Although I am an Architect, I find choosing and using colors still confusing, though I roughly know red from green. I have read some color books and am still confused. When I picked up this book, I thought, ""Oh, another color book. Won't help me much."" On reading it, I found the DK concept, that colors should reflect the real richness of color mixes found in the natural world, to be an eye-opener. The book goes on to give examples with explanations. The concept is refreshing, but the examples and explanations is quite conceptual, and not as specific as I would have liked, on choosing the actual colors. Still, I find my eyes slowly opening more and more as I read and reread the book. I intend to get the other two related books."
2,Lovely but not at all instructive,"I found this book to be quite lovely, much like flipping through an Architectural Digest Magazine. However, it didn't help me at all in determining appropriate paint colors for my home. The text was a bit arduous to get through and more descriptive than instructive. Overall I was disappointed because I got no help at all with specifics on selecting color palettes. With a title like ""Color Palettes"", one would expect otherwise."
4,Beautiful book to match color combos up,"Decorating certainly begins and ends with the color palette one selects. We have found ourselves puzzled continually over wanting to add color, but afraid to venture out.This book, although the Donald Kaufman Collection is expensive to obtain, allowed us to get enough palette combinations together which we could then match up with color samples from our local paintstore.It worked out great1 We're now in color all over the house and planning more! Great idea generator with wild, bold colors placed together. Excellent concepts on the flow of color throughout the house!"
2,"A fine coffee table book, but not much more.","While this is a beautiful book visually, it provides little concrete guidance on how to choose colors for your own home. The text isn't well-organized, and is presented in rambling narrative chapters rather than in a reference book format."
1,A dud,"The reviewers who love this book must be looking at a different book than the one I received. Or maybe those reviews were written by the author's mother! This book is so dull and the color choices are so limited that I don't see how the book's contents begin to match the title. Color palettes? It's all variations on beigy colors-everything the subdivision builder put in our new home and everything we are now trying to get rid of. Atmospheric interiors? If you like the atmosphere of a brown grocery bag, then you might like this book. Give me COLOR, please, and not variations on a safe, dated beige scheme that my mother would like."
1,Sadly old looking,"This book is old looking and is not giving me the inspiration and help I was looking for. I'm trying to get away from my ""builder beige"" house so the idea of ""atmospheric interiors"" sounded great. Unfortunately, this author seems to think that ""atmospheric interiors"" ARE beige or variations thereof. Depressing, dated."
1,Boring,"This is a fine book IF YOU LIKE BEIGE and variations thereof. If you want color in your home, then this is NOT the book for you."
1,"""Atmospheric"" ?","Well, this book was a big waste of money. If you want to live with all the ""atmosphere"" of a brown paper bag, buy this. If you want to put color into your home, don't."
1,Pretty but limited in its scope or value,"I admit that I don't know who Donald Kaufman is or what his color collection is, but the cover looked inviting, and I need color help, so I bought it. Mistake! It's a pretty book, but there's not much IN IT. The color choices are very, very, VERY limited. It seems that the creator of this ""color collection"" has a very narrow view of color choices and schemes-as in beige, beige, and beige. Will some amazon reader recommend a GOOD color book to me please?"
4,A fun book,Planning a weekend getaway? This book will help you decide where to go in the diverse Bay Area region. It has alot of interesting tidbits about areas even long time residents may not be aware of.
1,Pointless buy,I'd like to point out that you can just buy generic and fun stickers at cvs that are way less expensive than this.
2,Okay watch,I purchased this watch as a deal of the day ($49). I have several other Bulova watches but I have to admit this watch is only worth at $50. The quality of the watch is not what I expected being that it was from Bulova.
4,"Fish likes it, but too big","While my fish does like this food, they're simply too big for him; he constantly spits them out at this size. I have to break them up by hand to make them small enough (he's not a small betta by any means, either). He happily devours them afterward, but it's a pain having to grind them up every time.However, I must say that I do very much like these pellets for one big reason: They don't cloud up the tank at all. Most leftover pellets make the water a cloudy, goopy mess, but not these. Though breaking them up by hand might be annoying, I'd still recommend them for this reason."
2,It's beta food and there's not a lot,"Although I knew the amount included in the product, we were still amazed at how little food there is in this container. Our two fish likes the food OK, but we'll be buying the stuff from the pet store next time that comes in the much larger container."
3,My fish like it but..,"They like it, but I don't know if I just got a bad batch but the pellets seem a little to big for their little mouths and they have trouble swallowing it. But of course if I crush them up a little they no longer float, creating a mess of uneaten food that I was hoping to avoid."
2,Tetra Betta that my Betta hates,My late betta would only eat them dried worms. She would always spit back out the pellets contained within this fish food. Perhaps my betta is not acclimated to this product? So I gave 2 stars instead of 1.
4,exceptional information,"Bennet's book is detailed, readable and contains all the information that is needed to start rafting, though the information on the types of boats available is a bit dated. His chapters on the river bed morphology and the effects on the moving water are understandable and excellent and far makes up for the older information on this years raft models.We have used this as a basis for our white water rafting cours."
4,Nice bag,"Nice bag. I've had good luck with Case Logic. They seem to be about the best their is, at a fair price."
4,Handy but small,"This bag has most of what I have been looking for but nowhere in your advertisement could I find the size. Guessing by the picture, it is smaller than I expected. It is well made but does not have room for more than 2 extra rolls of film and there's not a place for my passport!"
3,Decent Bag,The bag itself is okay. I didn't like the material though. It is actually entirely black vinyl (like a kids backpack) and it doesn't have the contrasting colors like it shows in the picture. It holds cameras well though. I have a rather large point and shoot and it fits quite nicely. I would have been happier if it looked like the one in the picture though.
4,Does the job,I bought this bag for my Canon Sureshot 85. The camera and 3-4 rolls of film fit into the bag well and it is easy to carry.
4,Very good bag for my little Fuji camera,"Well, like my title says, this bag was perfect for my little Fuji digital. I'm able to throw in 2 sets of batteries in the side pockets, carry my wallet and cell in the front zip, the camera in the middle, and an extra memory card.My only complaint about this bag is the lack of stability in the middle. Unless your very careful, with a lot of bumping, I think the camera would get damaged = not a good thing. But overall, if you need a quick, down and dirty bag, this is pretty darn good. For the money, it's worth it."
3,Shipping disappointment.,"Unfortunately, I ordered three different products of this type and all of them had some broken during shipping. Other than that, I love the idea and they are a fun gift for kids in the summer."
5,Great Album,"I got this album like 3 years ago and i gotta say it has solid lyrics, solid beats, and it is a nice canada/u.s. colabo. Although they only got one video (at least to my knowledge)dont be fooled, they just have a small record company and not very good publicity... so if u've actually heard of Al' Sham & K.P. and u've looked into this album, get it, trust me u wont be disappointed."
5,Bless !,Product came in a timely manner and in excellent condition. Classic Wailers sound from the 80's par excellence.
1,don't even think about it!,"The only pro is it perfectly the clie tg-50. Other than that:1. Wears out fast. Mine lasted a few weeks. Also, does not stand a heavy use (say 1/2 hour ecah day)2. It get dirty fast, too. do not believe you can wash it, as advertised. Won't work3. Did I mention it is quite expensive?"
1,Did not even make the list,Brighthand did a comparison article about screen protectors and they did not even consider this brand to be one of the top five. How good can it be? Go to the brighthand website and see the results for yourself before you buy.
5,This is not an advertisement,"In short, these are the good features of this protector:1. Easy to install, just match up the bottom edge of the protector and screen and slowly apply the protector from bottom to top.2. Durrable, Ive had other sony protectors for extended periods of time and they are still perfectly functional and do not impede my ability to do anything with the device.3. Compatibility, you can be guaranteed that this protector will work with your tg50, which has a non-standard screen, because it is from sony.Don't listen to that last review which plugs some other company, i checked their website and couldn't even find one compatible with the tg50! This will work just fine."
1,The material is more fragile than other Sevylor Snow products,"I have quite a few Sevylor products for water and snow and in general I am very happy with them. This is one of three Sevylor Snow products I bought. As the weather went through freeze/thaws, the material became brittle and then on the first ride, the whole bottom tore out. This is very different from the other products that are just great."
4,Handle Luggage 6 Brwn,"I needed a handle that would be 6 inches long. This handle itself is about 5 inches long, but I guess the distance between the outer edges of the brackets is 6 inches. I sent it back for a return, but the company did not refund my money. Otherwise, for a 5 inch handle, it looked ok, without opening the plastic package."
4,Nice to not need a new machine,"My husband drinks a lot of iced tea. The newer models of Mr. Coffee's Iced Tea Makers have smaller pitchers. These are labeled to make 3 quarts, but he has a system where he squeezes 3.5 out of them. With the smaller pitchers he goes through 2 a day. His original pitcher was stained and scratched up. It really grossed me out! So, for Christmas I got him this 2 pack of nice, clean pitchers. So far they seem great. They are exactly the same as the original. After receiving the pitchers and reading the inclosed returns policies from the seller I am glad they worked out because food and beverage service items are not returnable."
4,"Fun Read (I know, I'm a geek)","The book is written in clear and understandable english which I thought was nice. The point of view expressed was completely new to me which is always refreshing whether one agrees or not. Alegro makes a good case, but as I am not an expert in his field (and few that are agree with him) it's difficult for me to substantiate his claims. His arguments are clear, well thought out, and well described in this book however. I read it, I enjoyed it, and I'm proud to have it in my collection."
3,One Star or Five Stars,"This book does not deserve the three stars I gave it. As a work of scholarship it deserves one star (if any), as a speciman of original thinking, it deserves five. Three is just an inappropriate average. It is one of the great crackpot books of all time, ranking with When Worlds Collide, The Day after Roswell, and The Lost Continent of Mu. It is a work of sheer genius. It is also absolute nonsense. Christians misunderstand the New Testament because they don't realize that Jesus was really a mushroom. Why hadn't this occurred to me before?"
5,Basic DirecTV dish,"This dish works to receive single satellite non-HD DirecTV. I put it up myself using simple tools. It took about one and a half hours including finding and tweaking signal on the satellite. (The Sony receiver I have has afunction for aiming the dish, and I presume all sat receivers have this. It is simple.) Works great."
1,This is horrible service. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON,I ordered a Direct Tv dish from this person and it said it would ship within 3 weeks. Why does it take 3 weeks to ship something? I sent 3 emails to this person and never got a response at all. I will be canceling my order and filing a claim with Amazon. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PERSON.
4,good value for the price,"A good quality item for the price, I used on a long trip, very useful, there is a slight looseness with eye piece."
5,It is a crime that this book is out of print.,"I discovered Frog after reading Interstate. In both novels, Dixon plays with the possibilities afforded characters by way of choice and fate. If this sounds overly experimental or postmodern or tricky or whatever, be reassured: Dixon cares nothing for funny stuff or flashbang. Page by page, he is about the business of exploring what it is to live inside a single head, and line by line we track the progression of life through the mundane, and surprisingly, we find that we become as fascinated with the seemingly mundane events of his characters' lives as they do. It's no magic spell he's casting. It's that rarer thing, at least in contemporary fiction: the reality spell."
4,My Aunt Loves It,"The design is unique, so i got it for my aunt who collects kaleidoscopes. The images formed are very cool, and one could argue will never create the same image twice. There is essentially an infinite amount of images formed due to the glitter filled stick at the end of the scope."
3,Alright,"Carl Thomas' album has two sides to it: the one is his silky-smooth voice. He sings well and it shows on songs like ""Emotional"", ""I wish"", ""My Valentine"", and ""Cold, cold world"". The production, however, is the downfall. He enlists a variety of renowned producers such as Mario Winans, Heavy D, and D-Dot, as well as Mike City and others, but the production just sounds dull and monotonous for the most part. With that many different producers one would expect the album to be inconsistent, but instead, it's too monotonous. The only tracks that really differ much are the four mentioned above, the rest sounds like one and the same. If you don't mind this one major flaw, I'd recommend this album, if not, maybe you should pick up Joe's latest."
4,An excellent example of the genre,"This album is a well produced, well sung and very well written album. It really does have an old-school R&B feel to it (a la early Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding, The Four Tops, Gladys Knight and the Pips). This is a first rate slow jam. It is not revolutionary, don't look for anything overly innovative. Carl Thomas knows his strengths, an excellent voice and good song-writing skills, and he works with those. He is not D'Angelo, he's not going out on a limb. If you liked the Deborah Cox cd I think you would like this cd."
2,ALright Voice Formula Material,This Disc is Basically Current R-N-B Formula.His VOice at times Sounds Like Brian Mcknight's did when he first came out.I Wish was a Catchy Song but with the Right VOcalist it would Have Blown Up.The Music Never Rises above being Average.Maybe He will Get Better With Time.
2,Its Not As Good As Everyone States,"After reading the reviews, I immediately went and purchased the CD. The CD has a few (maybe 3) good tracks, however, it is not the greatest CD that I have heard. I purchase alot of R&B and I would rate this CD on the lower end of those purchased. Maybe he'll improve over time."
1,Emotional about wasted songs,"There are 17 tracks on this CD. Seventeen! And you have to get to 14, 15, 16 to hear some great singing (Supastar, Summer Rain, Hey Now) outstanding songs. Why? Why is it some artists feel they have to bombard you with 17 tracks of useless noise instead of focusing on 9 or 10 great tracks? I can't believe I put the time in to find the 3 songs that are simply outstanding on this CD....I didn't give up after the first dozen of painful tracks..wish i had a delete key to get rid of the horrible songs....this guy can flat out sing...someone give him a new producer or songwriter"
1,"Could I give this a zero stars, please?","It's been said that for every 8-10 artists the RIAA supports, only one returns a profit. I now know why that is.I'll admit to not owning the album. Just the first song I've heard (""I Wish"") is enough for me to toss the disk into the garbage if someone bought me the disk. It doesn't even warrent being a coaster. Yes, it's that bad.""Then she dropped the bomb on me/When she said that she/was unhappily married with children/and I wish I never met her, at all"" Or: ""Oooooaaaaaooooo. Anything. I am anything. I am the one that you're perceiving in your heart."" Yes. Such deep, meaningful, high quality lyrics go so well with music that sounds like someone just got a new keyboard and thought that music consists of pounding a few keys."
4,"""SO EMOTIONAL"" , yet slightly uneven.","I just purchased SO EMOTIONAL, and just finished playing it, and for what it's worth, it's pretty good, yet pretty confusing. On certain songs, his voice fits perfectly, on others, it's like he TRYING to make it fit perfectly. There are tracks where his voice shouldn't be on it at all! Believe it or not, I focused on the music more than the artist. Carl Thomas has potential, so I won't write him off. What is needed is for all tracks on his next offering to blend in and fit with his voice, so that the end result will make a more balanced effort. Last I heard, square pegs still don't fit in round holes."
5,Phenomenal!,"This CD is breathtaking. Carl Thomas captures your soul and your feelings. He is clearly a phenomenal artist and shows it through the way he sings and the depth of his songs. This CD will keep your Head bobbing and your lips moving. Be prepared to really Enjoy this CD, Many people can relate to it . It is perfect to listen to at home, on your job ,in the car and of course with your special sweety.Who can go wrong with having this CD, Noone!. There was not a song on the CD that I was dissapointed with! It was all Great!"
3,"AT FIRST NOT CONIVINCED, BUT....IT'S OK","This is definitely a CD that had to grow on me because when I first listened to it I thought it was trash. But I started to like it alot more after playing it several times. ""I Wish"" is the best song on the CD and the other songs are ok. It is very hard to like this CD immediately because Carl Thomas has such a unique style. I can only give it 3 stars."
5,the voice!!,"When I first heard ""I wish"" I could not wait for the entire album. Carl has a beautiful voice. He has great jazz phrasing. I was really disappointed with the production. For this beautiful voice it sounds as if they put some casio-style production behind him. Don't get me wrong, there are some beautiful songs here but they sound like demo's not the full on production. He gets 5 stars for the voice! but I would pass on this c.d.. Wait for the next one. Perhaps he will have more control."
4,shocked,i was shocked that this cd was actually good. great voice and great sound. good one to have in anyone's cd collection.
4,Wonderful Album,"This is a great album to have. Carl Thomas is great in show, he really pours his heart into the music. He is so theatrical in his movements and has great annuciation. My favorite song on the album is ""Cold, Cold World"" you feel the hurt and emotion in the chorus as Carl pleads, ""It's a cold, cold, cold world leaving here without in my life."" This album is must have for all true music lovers. Carl incorporates an ol'skool, groovy type feel to the music esp. with ""Emotional"" ,""Valentine"" and""Woke Up This Morning"". His soulful style is somewhat reminiscent of an Al Green or Curtis Mayfield. Carl Thomas does not receive as much gratification as he is deserved."
5,sheila's (name means music ),"Well, with my name meaning (music).I know good when it's there .and this is one of them! good emotions is what I feel when,I hear ""EMOTIONAL"" and all of Carl's music. and that's just the bottom line so far! THANK YOU. Truly;just love good music ""SHEILA PATE"""
4,One of the best soul/R&B releases of 2000!,"I do not usually get into R&B/Soul music that is embraced by the mainstream audience, but I decided to give Carl Thomas a chance after hearing so many good things about the album. I am glad I listened. I do not know how to classify this album because it is much better than most of the stuff that you hear on urban radio, but it is not quite neo-soul. This album is an example of what real R&B/Soul music is supposed to sound like. Hey Now and Supa Star are some tunes on here that are reminiscent of old-school sounds. Summer Rain, Emotional, Supa Star and Cold Cold World are some of my favorites. Get this album and if you are like me, the only button that you will be hitting while listening to this album is the repeat button."
5,Excellent,"This album is truly ""Emotional"". A release from all the ""sexin"" type of r&b songs on the billboard. A return to the poetic nature of music & songwriting. Something that can take you back to an old love, new love, and heartbreak. Some special tracks: ""You Ain't Right"", ""SupaStar"", ""Cold Cold World"", ""I Wish"", & ""Hey Now"". This is a MUST BUY for any music lover."
4,Great Freshman effort....,"Right out of the box this CD is fantastic! I don't think during my first listen I hit the FF button once! I continued to let EMOTIONAL and MY VALENTINE play...over, and over and over! Great production and Bad Boy has a keeper in Mr. Thomas. There are VERY few R&B albums these days that let me ""blast to the past"" with the old school, this CD belongs on that list. I'm ALREADY looking forward to CD #2 from Carl. This one belongs in your CD collection, under SMOOTH....."
5,Excellent,I find this CD to be the epitome of R&B. Carl Thomas' voice is extremely sultry and soulful. I enjoy listening to every track on this CD without fast forwarding anything. Each song shows his ability to reach phenominal heights of expertise. I highly recommend everyone purchasing this CD.
2,"Nothing New, Interesting or Noteworthy","Given that the DPRK, as a topic, is a source if nearly limitless curiosities, anachronisms, and other fascinating potential, this brief 60 Minutes piece provides little more in the way of interesting content than the most cliched sound bytes we've all seen on the news during the recent escalation of tension during the North Korean nuclear tests (a.k.a. ""Kim's Folly""). At less than 15 minutes of actual footage, aside from Dan Rather's repeated mispronunication of Pyongyang as ""Poy-nang"", there's little, if anything new to be discovered herein.I'm surprised that the 60 Minutes producers didn't just raid the stock footage archives instead of the time, expense, and hassle of making a trip all the way there for this. It would be overpriced at half the price."
2,Pass on these. Get Bosch or Rain X.,These were ok when I first put them on. They became streaky and noisy in no time.
3,"GOOD PLAYER ,HORRIBLE POWER","I recently purchased this player and overall have been fairly happy. I use it primarily for recording lectures, and transcribbing. One problem I have with this player is that the record level as well as the playback level are rather low. The biggest problem for this unit is the batteries. The one key point many of theses other owners are overlooking is the fact that these ""great rechargable batteries"" are NiMH. THEY BUILD MEMORY !!! The bad part about this other then the usual, is the fact that you need to ""dock"" the unit in order to download or upload. Every time you dock, the charger automatically is set on. One could argue and say just disconnect the charger but the unit runs solely on the freakin' batteries ! If creative comes up with a way to upgrade the power to Li Ion they will have themselves one heck of a unit !"
4,"Good little Mp3 player.. I mean little, this baby is small",This mp3 player is small and has tons of functions.. its sturdy and works ok. only problem is these rechargeable batteries dont work...
1,Great While It Lasted,I purchased my Nomad II in December of 2000. In October of 2001 it died on me. I threw it away and purchased an Intel player. Beware of Creative MP3 players.
1,Get To Know Nomad Warranty Service,"I formerly owned a Nomad II, which broke after about a year. I then purchased a Nomad II MG, which I had to return because the charging cradle didn't function. I purchased another one, and that one stopped working after about thirty days. I would steer clear of this frail product.(P.S. Why would anyone with an IQ higher than a chimp buy three of these things? I couldn't find another one with expandable memory and an FM tuner)."
1,Save your money... bad product...,"A review that I should have written YEARS ago - I know that this product is no longer made. It peformed very poorly and finally gave out just after the warranty had expired. This technology has come a long way since - I would never buy an ""iPod"" knock off - unless it had a very good track record of performance and ease of use."
2,Quality issues,"I have generally enjoyed this player (quirks about the layout of the buttons notwithstanding), when it works. I have had to send it back to Creative three times at about $7 a pop for different reasons (a stuck button, audio cutting out, display cutting out, volume control only going up). Generally, support has been of little help until badgered into giving me an RMA. The last time, I sent it back I was told I would receive a new player. I have no way of knowing for sure that the player is ""new"" or ""refurbished"" (they said it would _not_ be refurbished), but judging from the condition of the case, I'm a bit suspicious. The player, however, is having problems with the display cutting out. Aside from that, it functions normally, but if this is a ""new"" player, and given my problems with the last player, I would be wary of their quality control."
2,Great Player When it Works,"I have only owned the Nomad II MG and I loved it at first - the sound is great, the software is simple to use and it's small enough to take to the gym and run with. After a few weeks one of the batteries stopped making contact and the player wouldn't work. I sent it back to Creative Labs to be fixed and purchased a new one to have as a back up. The new one that came had the same battery contact problem after one week. I have since sent that one back and am now searching for a new model. I don't recommend the purchase of the Nomad II MG until they correct the battery contact problems."
5,Great Product,"The Nomad II MG, is definately a good buy. I would highly recommend it to others. It is easy to use, easy to connect to your pc (it comes with a docking station) and easy to transfer MP3's back and forth. I have read many other reviews about this, and the only complaint I had heard was that there was no wired remote...well, that's not true. I purchased the wired remote for this player online at Creative.com. It works great, although I have found that with a little practice you don't even need it...you can easily manipulate the buttons on the actual device right through the case it comes with. This is a sure buy!"
2,A lot of money for features that don't work.,"I was very disappointed by this product. For starters the normally ships in 24 hours ended up shipping in about a week. When it did arrive it was fairly easy to set up. The software that came with it was very good and made it very easy for a novice mp3 user to both add internet music and rip stuff from my CD's. The mp3 functions are fine and the sound is good. Now the problems- after about three hours use the unit stopped working. The battery clip wasn't holding enough tension on the battery to make contact, when I tried to fix it broke. With a small piece of tinfoil I was able to make due. Now my major complaint- The FM tuner is garbage. I'm in the NY Metro area, less than an hour from Manhattan, and I am totally unable to pull in the major stations and those that do come in switch between stereo ad mono making them un usable. For what they are charging for this unit it is ridiculous to have this kind of performance."
4,Still working after 2 years,"Felt I had to add this after reading all these reviews. I got my II MG over 2 years ago and it still works fine. Only problem is the display sometimes flickers on and off, but if you tap it it comes back. I use this for the gym, travel and in my car. I've dropped it numerous times and gotten it wet and it still works fine. I have deleted songs accidently as others seem prone to as well, and agree button placement was poor. Overall this player has been great, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Creative product."
2,"Great features, if it works","I bought this unit about 6 months ago but have only been able to use it for half that time, due to repeated battery/dock station failures. And, as previous customers stated, the customer service (is bad)(not to mention it's a long-distance number). After the warranty runs out(3 months!!!), they charge you a $20 ""diagnostic"" fee on top of the cost to repair it.I did like the features and look of the unit, but it's definitely not worth the hassle of the shipping and long-distance charges to get it fixed. I'm moving on..."
1,What's with those darn battery contacts?,"I had the thing for less than a week and the battery contacts break and now I read this is not uncommon with the unit. When I sent it back to Creative they tried to screw me by claiming my warrenty was up (information I only got by constant badgering). I swear these guys must be trying to lose customers. If I do manage to get a new one it's probably only a time bomb waiting for those battery contacts to break again. A waste of money (and more importantly - time!), don't bother!"
1,Nice and just as expected,nicely put together; fits well and is attractive. Well worth the price. I wish they made ones for food processors.
4,Fits Ok but cheap fabric,"Pros:Nice off white colorFits the toaster fineHas a pull tab to pull it off easilyBig enough to drop over the toaster without effortCons:Not very high quality fabric like the Kitchenaid coverThat said, I think I'll get the matching Ritz cover for my mixer. It's less than a tenth the cost of the Kitchenaid covers. And it'll match my toaster cover."
4,Toaster Cover,"I bought a new toaster and needed a bigger cover. I like the cover, but it is about an inch too short. It does not fully cover the bottom of the toaster. It fits the rest of the toaster fine. Today's toasters are much bigger than the old one I had. Perhaps the company should adjust the measurements to accommodate the new appliances."
4,black toaster cover,"It fits just fine, exactly what I wanted. What can you say about a toaster cover. It works. This product is harder to find than you would expect."
5,Toaster cover,"I wanted to change my kitchen color to black but I barely use my toaster; therefore, I didn't want to have to buy a new one. The Toaster cover looks beautiful in the kitchen and works out fine, I recommend this product."
3,The essentials...,"Miles Davis Influenced Music like no other person, with a beautiful personnel of Coltrane and dizzy Gilespie, there are some really great miles material here, Not For novice!If your a novice I suggest check out Blue Miles, some of the highlights of his beginning period!"
2,good..but no illustrations,Typical Tom Swift Jr classic but the lack of illustrations detract from the story. Some of the best books in this series were well illustrated.
1,worst show ever - do NOT be fooled by the 5-star reviews!,"This is the worst show ever produced - taking advantage of Seinfeld fans misguided loyalty, and the wrongful thought, that since this is made by Larry Davis, it has to be good... it don't!After a couple of episodes (if you actually get this deep into it before throwing away the dvd's) you realise that the dialogue actually follows the same structure and speech patterns that Seinfeld does - only this show has no proper actors or comedians to deliver the lines.It's stiff, slow, tries to hard but keeps on failing, annoying, embarrassing and quite frankly a disaster.I have no idea who these guys are that gives this 5 stars, but they have to be family of Larry's.I bought the entire series based on the stupid 5 star reviews and the fact that I too thought that 'Larry Davis, this can only be good' - but I've had to through the dvd's out without even seeing all the episodes.Waste of time and money!!!"
5,One of the Best TV Shows Ever,"Curb is basically a continuation of Seinfeld... if you love Seinfeld, you'll absolutely love Curb.Larry David = George, and HBO gave Curb the oppertunity for longer R rated shows."
5,Want to get in a better mood?,"Truly, one of the best for elevating any bad mood you are in! You can't help but laugh -- even when you don't want to!"
4,Mediocre,"I loved season 2 and season 1 was ok. Season 3 is hits and misses. There are great episodes like ""Soda water and salt,"" and there are bad episodes. Curb is a great show where the littlest things are blown way out of proportion."
5,I love larry,The funniest show on tv is Curb your enthusiasm. Larry David is so funny and if you loved Seinfeld you will love this too. I recommend buying all the seasons.
5,"""The absolute best season yet""","HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm really takes off into overdrive in the 3rd season for this series. I am finally glad to see this series get some recognition. This has to be, by far, the funniest thing on television. And this, the 3rd season, is my very favorite, with several of my favorite episodes from the entire series, particulary ""Chet's Shirt"", ""The Corpse-Sniffing Dog"", ""Crazy-Eyez Killah"", and ""The Grand Opening"".For the first time, a central theme is loosely followed from the beginning of the season to the end, where Larry along with several celebrity (and non-celebrity) business partners decide to invest in a restaurant. The season finale ends with the grand opening of the restuarant, and it is the most hilarious season finale a comedy show has ever had, in my opinion.Very Highly Recommended!"
4,Second- Hand Magic,"What a great book! I can not believe how creative the author was about the book. Paul and Caroline found a kite up in a tree and were wondering if it was magical. I wonder how the author came up with the idea? Maybe she found a kite and thought it was magical. However she got the idea , it was a good one. The author, Ruth Chew did very well. Her writing was detailed. For example the kite had very fine embroidery thread as the kite's string. I also liked how many characters were in the book, not too many and not too few. I really enjoyed this book. I know you will enjoy this book if you read it, and I think you will."
5,Best moisturizer for sensitive skin,"I have used this moisturizer for many years, and it's the only thing that does not irritate my super sensitive skin. Love this stuff and would definitely recommend!"
4,Works Well...,"I've been using this moisturizer for years. Although, I'm not a kid anymore, my skin can still break out. So, I have to stay away from the heavy moisturizes; lest I look like I've been afflicted with the pox. Using this product (in addition to the Neutrogena foaming face wash) seems to solve both problems... keeps me well moisturized without the breakouts."
1,Waste of space !!,I bought this as a filler. Forget fillers and buy Prime!! This cheap little cutting board was a waste of postage. I couldn't even give it away!!
4,Great songs-not so great transfer to CD,"The songs on this album are excellent, and belong in anyone's reggae collection. Unfortunately, the CD transfer from Shanachie doesn't hold up well. I have the original vinyl record and wanted to get the CD. The CD version makes the horns and keyboards in particular sound ""tinny"" and wavering. I took the CD back and exchanged it for another, and it does the same thing. I'm keeping it because the songs are great, but I'm unhappy with the quality of the transfer. Does anyone else out there notice this on their CD???"
5,O2 sensor,"You don't need a costly O2 sensor with an auto manufacturer's name on it. This part was over $200.00 at the dealership. I installed almost 3 years ago, still no faults."
4,Works fine,I have a 1995 VW Jetta and the part has worked fine for about 90 days. We will have to see if I have any issue but I will say after buying some no name part for my car and having to swap them out a week later you get what you pay for in brand name auto parts. 90% if your car is from the EU get the Bosch parts!!!
3,Interesting....,"This CD, although excellent in recording Titanic survivors eyewitness accounts, just doesn't live up to my expectations. The abridged version, I feel, cuts out some interesting information and leaves standard information surviving. Interesting accounts on Captain Smith from Eva Heart and a well prepared ""speech"" from Captain Rostron add intrest to this CD. Good to have but could have been jucier."
5,Counter-cultural insight/social conscience/sense of humor,"This book manages to criticize the dominant culture without being self-righteous because it is also a sensitive story of a young man from a small town as he develops and refines his social conscience. As he gets his counter-cultural education in the big city punk rock scene, he manages to maintain his perspective and sense of humor. This is a great book with a truly unique style and voice."
2,Mediocre at best.,"When I ordered this book about a jewish punk, I was expecting something a bit more exciting than a tale about a whiney midwestern boy moving to a big city. The concept of this book had so much potential, I can't understand why the author didn't do a better job of conveying the adventures of a punk across to the reader. Eliot, the main character, was active in the DC punk scene, but there was only a terse interaction within that scene. Overall, the book reads like one giant zine. If it's a zine you want, buy a zine. If you want a book, don't buy Tales of a Punk Rock Nothing."
4,"""tales of a punk rock nothing""","i really liked this book. It was very realistic in the way the way the events turned out. I like how Elliot did what he wanted to do despite the way other thought about it. Elliot also has a very ""independent"" way of thinking and viewing of the world and that made the book very interesting to read. The book shows that just because you don't go to college you are not doomed for failure. he had to go threw a lot of things, relationships with family friends and ""riot grrrls""."
3,an okay read...,"what i liked and disliked most about this book is that it felt like i was reading someone's lost misplaced journal. this is odviously exactly what the authors were going for, but at times it felt like all whinning and no winning- no progression. i'm happy to have read this book because it reminded me of everything i love about d.c. adams morgan etc. i could visualize the places in my head and wish that i was there too. this book is a must read for anyone who has interest in punk/feminist -remember the 90's, wish i was still there lifestyle (like myself)."
3,Interesting,"I enjoyed the style this book was written in. It was a good read. Nothing phenomenal or life-changing, but definitely enjoyable if you are interested in the punk subculture."
2,"Right city, wrong person, wrong tme","The DC punk subculture that Elliot satires and critiques is much different from the one I knew. Elliot moved to DC about a decade too late - after the punk/hardcore underground had long been drained of its choler & fury, replaced by apathy and infiltrated by confused, bourgeois transplants with delicate ideas. Elliot, not surprisingly, btiches about the state of affairs in DC punk, lives and works in all the trendy spots, starts an emo band, rubs shoulders with aging sXe scensters, and then promptly leaves. Too bad. Underneath the camouflage of Elliot's DC is a tremendously interesting city; flavored with Go-Go music, endless summer heat, and some of the most eclectic, gritty neighborhoods on the East Coast. That's hardcore."
1,Didn't last,"Nice looking watch and my son liked it very much until the second hand fell off after only a year or so of use. Very disappointed in the quality, not what I expected."
3,sentimental education,The book itself is great but the size of it I do not like. I should have bought a nicer one.
3,amazing novel,"This novel is a masterpiece. However, if you read French, give it a go in the original. If not, find another edition. This translation is rubbish, and not at all accurate. The translator took many liberties with the text, often straying from Flaubert's words greatly."
5,Lord knows the world does not await my 5 star review of this classic..,"Yes, yes, I'm sure Mr. Flaubert will do quite fine without this review. What do I have to add? Not much. But, I do want to say that this novel captures the passage of time better than any other novel I have read.I read the Penguin edition. I cannot tell you how the translation stacks up. I picked it out for the pretty cover and the way the pages laid flat when I read it. I used to always choose Penguin editions, but I fear the type is too small for my eyes now."
1,I agree this is an unreadable translation.,"After plodding through 50 pages, I sampled another tanslation at the library and realized that it was not Flaubert, but the un-named translator responsible for the awkward, unreadable sentences. Was this translated by a computer?"
4,A novel about unfulfilled promise,"The personal story of Frederick Moreau and the political setting of mid-19th century Paris reflect one another in the unfulfilled promise of his obsession with a married woman and the revolution's unfulfilled promise of reform and change.The novel offers little in the way of character development and that may be the entire point. Since Moreau's sentimental obsession with Madame Arnoux drives the action to a large degree and he never lets go of it despite his experience he is a study in arrested development. He lives through tulmutuous times , witnesses fortunes made and lost and yet in the end returns with his boyhood friend to where he began and seems to have absorbed no lesson from any of it.Flaubert's prose is eloquent and at times incredibly poetic in it's descriptions of settings and expression of feelings and the translation here is excellent."
1,Extremely Disappointed!!,"I have ordered a lot of used books on Amazon and always had success. I ordered this book for a class my daughter is taking and it was photocopied! It is the size of a book and has a cover, but it is photocopied. This is illegal and extremely unethical behavior for the dealer to mislead potential customers."
1,pathetic excuse for a novel,"This book did not appeal to me in the least. I think that Madame Bovary, with all its sexual incantations and rudeness is far more interesting. this book is sentimental and does little to further my educationi regret reading this book, and had I not been confident of forgetting most of its content within a few days, i would regret it bitterly.thankyou for reading"
5,Give me more of that Sentimental learning,"I agree with a reviewer before me that this masterpiece is overshadowed by Bovary and, for the life of me, I can't understand why. The main character is better, Emma Bovary's complaints do little to outshine Frederic Moreau's idle lifestyle. It's wonderful--the language, the descriptions and, most of all, the way in which Flaubert can make the reader see how utterly wretched the ""upper class"" lifestyle is. Excellent, from beginning to end."
2,Bad finish,"I bought two of these rotors thinking that they are Beck Arnley premium and the finish on the drum is real bad. These are made in China and the quality is real bad. I bought another set for my hyundai from Amazon and they sent me a nice set with great finish, which were made in Brazil. These items are cheaper on amazon but not worth it."
2,"Cute shoe, pained feet","SKeetcher's excursions are a very cute sandal/shoes! May be great for biking but for walking no. I'm not sure why. Could be the lac of instep support. Perhaps not the right shoe for thos of us with fallen arches. After walking five minutes, my feet hurt and I had blisters. SO I'll just wear them for going out to dinner or such where I won't be walking much. The price is a bit high. I would recomment hghly Keens brand for walking shoes if you're looking for a good walking shoe. I have a pair of those and they're wonderful! (Excellent arch suport and comfort.)"
1,Not impressed,"After having these as long as I have, I got 2 pairs expecting something more. They are not as comfortable & the elastic over the ball of the shoe doesn't have much give."
5,Excursion Sandals,"I was happy to find these shoes in a Size 5. I wear them almost every day. They are comfortable, and they are made of smooth leather. Truly a great looking shoe."
5,love these shoes,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have, I wear them all the time and I may buy another pair."
4,Beautiful shoes,I was recently on a cruise and saw these shoes on a woman...I immediately fell in love with the look and I generally love Sketchers (I have 3 other pairs)...I received them today and they look and feel great...the only downside is that they are very difficult to put on. Hopefully they will stretch a little.
4,out of this world funkyness,"This cd will metaphorically put a cap in your arse. It's really good, it's funky, you can put it on and listen to it over and over and keep finding new parts to it that you never noticed before. The best word I can find to describe the sound is labryinthe. There's lots of intellectually stimulating playing by some obviously really accomplished musicians.Its like all the parts in the song will be good, the singing, the guitar playing, the bass etc, so that you don't know which part you like best , so you humm different parts as you listen to it. I have ""Feel like livin"" in my head permanently. The sound is relaxing, and the playing and lyrics are very smart and conscious."
1,no stars from me!,"i am currently in school for carpentry. i don't have a whole bunch of tools, yet this piece of crap broke on it's first day (the seams in the cover, split while i was putting it together). as a matter of fact, it was already broken before i was in class (it broke while putting it in my car). if you are a REAL tradesman, DO NOT BUY THIS CART. every aspect of this cart was constructed from cheap materials and eventually (SOONER, rather than later) it WILL BREAK!"
2,Poor Quality,"Within the first week I had to fix the handle, which will no longer telescope. The front support legs are now also breaking. I will use the canvas portion of the tool organizer to build my own tote. Save your money. Great concept, poor execution."
4,"Good product, POOR shipping.","The product comes in a light duty cardboard box -- the kind you would expect to be unloaded from a pallet in a big home center store, not shipped by itself by UPS, Fedex, etc. Amazon just places a label on the box and ships it as is -- so naturally it arrives pretty beat up. Shame on them. The reel itself seems to be very good quality. There are issues with the assembly -- the directions vary from the actual product somewhat, so you need to improvise."
2,"Sturdy, but poor finish","Received this 1.5 years ago. Has been under the deck semi-protected from rain. Green paint has completely flaked off, creating quite a mess, and the metal underneath is completely rusted. Won't be long before the metal is rusted through and this goes to the dump. Looks like gardeners supply sells one nearly identical, but it is powder coated, which is generally immune to the weather. Unfortunately, it is unavailable now."
4,hose wagon,"Great product, easy assembly. A storage basket on the handle would be nice for nozzles, etc."
3,This is $49 at Menards under the name Yardworks.,"A decent review of this product I wrote on my own domain here: http://intelliq.net/blog/?p=354Keep in mind this unit is sold under the name Yardworks at Menard's for $49. You cannot touch any metal hose reels with metal fittings at this price anywhere. The wheels are a novelty in my opinion since I dont move the thing.If you want a quality metal hose reel, get this one without emptying your wallet."
2,Marginal design and quality,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009H5T2I/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleAssembly is too difficult for the average buyer. I had to go to the hardware store to purchase missing bolts and nuts. The angle from the metal tube (part of the reel assy) with male fitting to the hose which is taken up on the reel is insufficient and causes any hose to 'kink'. I fixed this by routing the hose to the outer ring of the reel and tying it with a tie-wrap. This affords the hose a more gradual and kink-free bend. Overall, if I spend $ [...]+(including shipping)I expect a design that works out of the box and I also expect all the parts necessary for assembly to be included in that price."
3,Hose Reel,"The first one received, had a badly twisted frame and missing hardware. It appeared to have been welded that way. Amazon was very quick to send another, which was in good shape, except for missing hardware. The manufacturer does not pack this item well. The hose reel appears to be fairly well built."
1,Arrived missing many parts...,"One piece of important advice... if it arrives with missing parts just send it back! We ordered this hose reel Oct. 18 and it arrived with parts missing and two months later we are STILL trying to get them. It took a search to find the company on the internet and get a phone number for them (no contact info on the enclosed paperwork). They said they'd send the parts right out. When that box arrived it had the wrong parts and wrong hardware packet. Another call to the company... more incorrect parts. It's now Dec. 16 and we're calling again for more parts (getting only voicemail and a message that they'll return our call on the next business day). We should have simply returned the hose reel in the first place instead of trying to ""work with them"" and make it right. The instructions are poorly done, not that it's rocket science to put together a hose reel. The parts look sturdy enough... if we ever get this thing put together it might work well. We'll see..."
1,poor quality junk,"First of all, Amamzon did a good job of giving me full credit without any arguments, but I had to call back until I got a person who's first language was English. This is an example of junk made in China or some third rate country. It leaked after one week and rusted in TWO days. Ames True Temper sent me a complete new cart for free {because the defective part was not available}. The second cart leaked the first time I used it and I swear it rusted right before my eyes. This junk reminded me of the last mid 80's GM car I owned. Stay away from this lousey cart."
2,Long term extented review,"I just finished my third season with the True Temper Hose wagon. The good points are:1) It holds a lot of hose.2) It is easy to wind up this large amount of hose.3) Easy to transport, but since I leave it in place most of time, it's not that big of a deal.The downside is that it probably won't make it through another season.1) The reel is starting to get very stiff and hard to turn.2) The chrome handle, pushbar and wheels are rusting badly.3) The green paint is peeling and rushing underneath.At this price I expected this to out live the cheaper plastic reels, but I'm very disappointed with the quality."
1,Parts missing,"If I had listened to previous reviewers, I may not have bought this item. As they said, many bolts were missing, the instructions are hard to understand and it came with a flat tire. I did not want to bother with trying to return it, so I purchased some carriage bolts at the hardware store and fixed the tire myself. You may want to buy this from a local dealer so you can return it easier!"
2,Very Questionable Product,"Poor instructions, poorly designed...leaks at connectors, no return address for ""lifetime warranty"" I wouldn't recommend this purchase"
1,Ruined by locking mechanism,Locks barely worked when new. Inferior lock. 7 months later RUST!!! I keep my truck in the garage 100% of time. Too bad an otherwise good design is ruined by the locking mechanism.
4,4.5 Fuzzy Green Stars,"Quite simply, the book is awesome. It's nothing short of delightful, that you can pick this book up, and randomly sort through level after level of creative inspiration, to discover that by the end, you too can't help but notice that you have a much higher appreciation for all of the things in your own life that affect everything you do. It makes its way elegantly into that special area of books on my shelf that i always reach to when I'm ""stuck"" and just need that little something going again. in short...READ THIS BOOK, then READ IT AGAIN. Then wait a little while, and don't read it because three times in a row and people start talking about you and your ""fuzzy green book"", and that's a hard one to shake..."
5,"Fresh, Fuzzy & Fun!","I saw the author-Pash, speak at the How Design Conference in Chicago (June 2005). His presentation was about how he got the idea for this book. It was very cool and inspiring. I couldn't wait to get a copy and start reading it. This book is filled with 40 top graphic designers perspectives on what inspires them. Photographs of the designers and their work stations. As well as a survey page that they all filled out (and one for you to fill out too). It is the kind of book that is so much fun to read. You feel like you are right there in the moment. This book draws you in, includes you and most of all inspires you. This is a great book for a graphic designer to own."
4,Inspired!,"This is a fun read, like you are listing to the conversations between the author and the 40 top graphics designers. Besides their works, this book also let you know more about these designers in an approachable way. Different disigners get their inspiration in different ways. I am definity inspired by their conversation through this book."
2,Just a way to multi-class,"I found this book to be somewhat limited. It is just small book of how to mutli-class a half orc around the barbarian class with the prestige classes to follow them up. Including, however silly, a barbarian paladin. If you are a big fan of half-orcs or dont already own a different race supplement, this might be a book for you."
5,The Food of Italy,"I keep this book open on my kitchen counter in an acrylic holder.The photos are amazing as everyone else noted but they also give rise to great food inspired by the traditional earthiness of Italy. Simple and straight forward all the food I have prepared has been sublime. The Roman Gnocchi, pared with The Florentine Pork Roast is beyond sublime.........Today I am making the Roast Turkey with an Apricot and cranberry ""Mostarada di Cremona"". You will love this book. My daughter a teaching chef even borrows it for her classes!"
4,cookbook of Italy,Very speedy delivery and product was in great condition. Give the seller a hand for gr8 job.I will buy from them again.
1,case also doesn't fit olympus 3030,"can't believe this case is too small, after reading reviews that case is too big for other cameras. I think it is irresponsible that these cases are being sold for cameras they don't fit. WASTE of MONEY..."
3,Not for the Olympus C3030,"It's a nice enough bag, but the C3030 won't fit in it. Don't buy it for this camera unless you enjoy sending things back."
4,Good product,"This carry case was perfect for my Kodak DC240. It was only big enough to carry my camera, extra batteries and perhaps 3 or 4 extra flash cards. In other words, there was no needless bulk (the padding seemed to make much of the size - but it gave necessary protection). It was much easier to access the camera and extras than all the other bags I've seen (due to its outer flap and inner zippered flap that both opened wide). The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the outer flap did not seal in such a fashion that sand and such could be well kept out (it was not really a problem on my Caribean vacation however). The other point and shoot camera bags I've seen which could handle sand better due to a zippered enclosure - also were terribly difficult to get my camera in and out of."
2,It is not for Olympus C3030,"I do not understand why this bag is on the C3030's list of accessories. It's to small for C3030. I bought it, hardly could squash the camera, than forgot to send it back. Just a warning for others ....."
3,Bag not as pictured,"Bag I received has a zipper front entry, and a zipper pocket in back for batteries, card, etc. The zipper front/top is stiff and awkward to open. The entrance is narrow, and since the case is rigid, it is hard to get manual in case, and manual must be curved once it is in. The mesh compartments and battery loops are a nice touch, and quality seems very good."
2,Case Logic DC50 Digital Camera Bag by Case Logic,"Very Disappointed. Too bulky, and way too spacious for my small digital camera I also bought through Amazon. If I saved the receipt, I'd return it in a second!"
5,Great For Kodak Digital Cameras,"I have the Kodak DC 3400 camera - and this carry case is perfect for it. This case is compact - but yet large enough to take everything along that I need: extra batteries, PC cables, the camera's manual and CD disk, and a Kodak AA battery charger.It works so well with the DC 3400, it's almost as if it was made for it. Good case for the money.To see if this case is right for you, compare your digital camera's dimensions to Kodak's DC 3400. If the cameras are similar in size, you're all set."
1,Not worth it!,After printing only a dozen pages I started getting a wide black/gray line along the left side. I ended up using it as a trade-in for another cartridge I bought at a local store. Definitely not worth the money!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SMOOTHIE MAKER!!!,Terrible Blender! Worst ever..THE Spout Leaks. It ate the silcone gasket. I ordered a new one. Now THE MOTOR JUST QUIT...When it was out of the box it smelled of electrical heat. I gave it no thought because many electrical tools and appliances sometimes smell that way when first used. It is going back.. Nothing but problems.
3,This book is holariousy funny and is great for all ages,This book is great it has good charictor plots and a great story line it is loads of fun and is still good to read even after the 7th time!
1,Ick Ick Ick Ick,"This book makes me think of something that could be made in to a very bad ""TEEN"" movie. It has a plot, that goes nowhere, and was really annoying. It is packed full of bad jokes, corney puns, and other bad stuff."
2,JOIN THE FRIGGIN' CLUB!!,"This is just a dumb story about a kid from a fictional country whose nose always bleeds called his ""post nasal drip"" and all the other kids are in a club who hate their school and try to make a scam against it. This book sucks."
5,Fun book,"This is a really cute book with actual photographs of kids and their animal friends from around the world. Very educational/interesting. My daughter loves it because it's the actual photos. Makes it seem more relatable. No real story to speak of, the draw is in the pictures of the children and animals. Fun."
4,Super cute pictures,This book is perfect for introducing your little one to the many animals and ethnicities of the world.
5,Legend,A great movie regardless if you are a Marley Fan or not.. I will purchase the movie.The life of Bob Marley is a true story of triumph and heartfelt reality.
5,Loved it!,This was a great and informative documentary. I am only sad that they took out so much to get the movie to 2 1/2 hours (read that in an interview with the director). I would've gladly sat in the theater for another half hour of looking into his life! This documentary gave me chills at some points and brought me to sadness in the end because we lost such an influential and great man. The only other disappointing thing is that I would've loved to see interviews from all his children...but it is still worth watching again!
5,A lot of questions answered,"As much as Marley is about his music, the documentary answers a lot of questions about who he was and what he believed. He is a fascinating person and this gives you an appreciation for his effort."
5,A must see!,"There are no words. This is a well researched, very well put together documentary that will make you dance, laugh, and cry."
5,Inspirational!,"Bob Marley was a guiding light. A Spiritual Leader on a level of Ghandi. Without looking to do so, many people were drawn to his words and music and lifted their spirits and their lives!This movie tells this story very well!"
3,Marley documentary,In my opinion the movie is quite chaotic and long. The background story has not been structured together specially for those of us who do not know much about his life. His life seems quite dark from the context of the movie. There are though some lovely concert scenes. It could have been done much better.
3,"Good, but not the best!","As a huge fan of reggae music and Bob Marley i was really looking forward to this movie. I have to be honest i was a lil disappointed. I gave it 3 stars, but its a weak 3 stars1.Failing to deal with Marley's other children is now a problem when documenting bob's life. it would have been great to hear from julian,kymani, robbie etc.2.Way too much time on cindy breakspeare and bob. We have heard this story in every documentary made.3. the subtitles were too small (ok i am being picky)this is a good movie. marley/reggae fans need to get it. but this is not a definitive movie1Love"
5,Fantastic,"I have been listening to reggae since the '80s,and while the Marley' s haven't been the top choice, this documentary was great. It puts his life in review, starting in the trench town slums, through his success as an adult. Of particular interest was how he got the cancer.Great movie"
5,Great movie,A great recount of Bob's life and I learned something's that I wasn't aware of. It's a great history lesson on reggae music and the impact on our culture.
5,Excellent!,One of the better documentaries I have seen. Came away much more informed about Marley personally and his philosophy on life.
5,Great documentary on the KING OF REGGAE!!!,This documentary gives you a detailed summary of Bob Marley's life and the struggles of his time. I highly recommend watching it!!!
5,marley,My husband was very pleased and watches it every chance he gets. We look forward to purchasing more Bob Marley items from you.
2,"Bland, Unfocused Effort","Bland, Unfocused Effort is a good way someone put it. It's an alright movie. I like Bob's music but if anything this movie shows that this life style is not healthy. The biographical points were interesting."
2,Marley,Movie okay but didn't really learn any thing new from movie. As a big Marley fan really disappointed for was expecting new information.
2,Not a Fan,"If you're into not working, smoking weed, and making (young) women subservient to you then you'll love this movie! The movie itself was fine, well produced, and portrayed Marley in a neutral light. I was interested in learning more about the man, but now I'm glad that I was never into his music. I have to admit that if I didn't have a streaming video credit, I would not have wasted the money on the movie."
5,amazing,"amazing documentary about an amazing man, not much to say if you know or heard of bob, you must watch this documentary;"
5,Great!,This was an excellent documentary on Bob Marley's life. It focussed on his love for the music and his philanthropy. I am from the Caribbean and never really knew much about his final days. This documentary gave more insite into it.Strongly recommend this movie.
4,Texturizer NOT a Relaxer,I've been using this product for about 15 years or so. I love it! I have 3C curls and it reduces the frizz. I can blow dry my hair straight or leave it curly. Make sure to read the directions several times carefully if you're planning to do it yourself.
2,not a very good buy,"the product arrived on time, but the quality is poor. The light is too dim. would not recommend buying"
2,Dick likes to hear himself talk,"This book is a wordy testimony to the author himself. The entire 1st chapter is nothing new to anyone who has ever looked at statistics or data of any kind. Nor is much of the rest of the book for that matter. There are a few good ideas near the end, however, he spends so much time talking in circles, quoting himself, and using writing styles that I would never accept from my students that much of the meaning is lost in the process. Perhaps it is simply the style of his writing I do not like. It is hard to follow and seems to repeat itself."
4,Solid Slip-On Dress Shoes,"The Good:- Versatile look- Fairly comfortable- Great for those of us who travel frequently (airport security)The Bad:- had to add heel pads to minimize slippage- the shoes seem prone to squeakingI got these for less than $30 so I'd say they are a definite buy at such a low price. At a $70 to $80 price point, I'd probably drop my rating to three stars as there is nothing special about the shoes."
5,Great quality,No break-in period but there is some discomfort on the top of the foot. The ones in brown color are definitely richer and more attractive looking then the black ones. Of course Clarks quality is superb!Arthur Chachuna[...]
3,NOT MADE IN ENGLAND!!!,"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT MADE IN ENGLAND AS AMAZON CLAIMS IT TO BE. It's made in CHINA! I did partially base my purchase of this Clarks shoes over another pair of Clarks shoes because it was supposedly made in England, but IT ISN'T! BUYER BEWARE!"
2,Shipping is horrid,"I ordered this book paying extra for overnight shipping, because my next class was 4 days away, and a week later, the book is still not here, along with the estimated shipping date being another week away.I've called Amazon and they said it was in the hands of UPS now. I call UPS and they state it's a backlog from the holidays.If I pay for overnight shipping, which is quite expensive, I expect it to be here in at least 3 days. The book was ordered before the holidays, and honestly, I wouldn't mind if my book were to be backlogged one or two days, but it's taking two weeks now and I'm falling behind in class.I should have paid the $250 at my local bookstore and gotten it the day before class. I guess I won't order from Amazon again."
1,Is anyone under the age of 65 who reviewed this book??,"Only reason I ask that is because the first review used the phrase ""stick-in-the-mud..."" which hasn't been used since before WW2...Ramone! Hogwash is what Jim does in the tub after he abuses the gargoyle of a fat girl."
3,Ok. not bad-unless a fanatic don't buy,"Virtua Athlete is a fun game, but if I had a choice to buy it again, I would have said no. Graphics are pretty good, but not fantastic. I would only buy this if I were a real fanatic about track, which I'm not. If you really like this sport, a good buy, otherwise, don't. Get Soul Calibur instead."
4,WYSIWYG,"Okay; if you want something STURDY this may not be the tripod for you. Out of the box I was a little afraid, but I liked the fact that it is this small, while extending a fair length. I do miss a quick-release and the (easy extending & retracting) legs don't spread out very wide, but for a cheap, lightweight tripod compared to the price I paid I cannot complain. In practical use it does all that I require it to do and it holds my 2.2 lbs camera stable and still (I shot some long exposures of the moonrise over Palm Springs from a windy 10'000ft peak). Nifty carry bag easily clips to your belt, but as mentioned elsewhere it may raise some eyebrows (looks like you are into something kinky). So; if you don't like to tote around a big tripod and you don't require easy (or any) panning and your camera is at or below 2 lbs, this may be all you need."
3,Not so good,"The tripod is small, and very nice to carry into a backpack. The materials are not good and the head comes with a loose screw."
3,Does the job,"I use video for training purposes and have to carry 3 camcorders and tripods at a time. The size and weight of this tripod is great. It is true that it is a little flimsy and somewhat shaky. I only use it with a very light camcorder and leave it in place for 15-20 minutes of static recording. While the different segments ""lock"" with little spring mounted balls clicking into their receptacles, the top segments lock by twisting and so far, one of the 3 I purchased does not lock well. Again, for what I do with these tripods, I am satisfied and I would not be upset if some electric tape was necessary to secure the legs in place. I may not trust the tripod with my SLR digital camera, especially with a significant lens on it. But I have not tried so..."
1,I wish I could return this,"It only works when you don't extend the legs AT ALL. The legs are absolute crap aluminum. Had they gone with plastic legs, this might have been a decent product. Don't buy it for anything more than setting on top of tables, books, etc."
4,Good little tripod,Does what you'd expect. Know that you have to give the first tube a twist to start the collapsing.
3,Big band fans watch out.,This DVD is only Brian and two of his budies - drums and base. Thats it!! Not a big band behind him!!
5,CONCERT DVD OF THE YEAR!!!,"This exceeded my expectations-which were already set high.Excellent behind the scenes footage,tons of goodies from the early years.Can't ask for much more!A big THANK-YOU TO everyone involved with releasing this!!Brian,Lee+Slim Jim are really having a good time here--totally immersed in the energy they create------feeding off the crowds enthusiastic delight!Most of the songs are very true to the original recordings(extended intros and solos hype the excitement)!!!The sound is fantastic---Lee's bass playing will shake your walls(nice!!).If you buy any concert DVD this year--buy this one!Rockabilly at its finest,as only the Cats can do it."
5,The Cats Rock The Place!,I just I love This Dvd & you will too. it's soo good it's criminal. put this dvd in & rock out with the cats. the disc worth every penny.This Dvd is For Stray Cats & Classic Rock Fans.This is a Great Dvd To Crank Up The Volume On.
5,Fantastic DVD,"Up til now, I haven't been a huge fan of the Stray Cats. Of course I was aware of them and enjoyed their music over the years. But this DVD has opened my eyes to what a great band they are. It's simply fantastic. This is what a DVD should be.Brian Setzer can really work his way around a guitar. What great tone. The drummer and bass player are huge. These guys are so cool. Great audience, too. The camera work, sound, editing, the packaging are all first class. The extras are fun and worth watching.These guys stay true to their style and their hardwork shows in a superior performance."
2,New formula = weaker band,"We had the original Red latex-free TheraBands. When those wore out we went to get another batch from Amazon. We were surprised with how much thinner it was and how much less resistance these new ones offered. Right on the box it does say this is a new formula. We wound up returning this in red and got the next resistance level up, Blue. Those were just right and comparable to the Red ones made in the original formula."
4,non-latex vs other,"I am used the latex version, purchased this in case anyone has an allergy. It doesn't seem to be as wide as the latex version, that's my only comment. Otherwise, it's just fine."
4,Polar RS200sd,"It's a very practice and functional product. It has a very friendly software, with every function you need to monitorize your trainning.Why for stars? Because of the SonicLink system that bring me some connections problems."
4,The Basic,It is not very flashy and it does what It says it will. It is a great starter for people just getting into running and trying to track their progress.
2,Good - if it worked,"Reliability seems to be a major issue based on my own experience and the reviews I read on various sites. My watch went blank after a few months of careful use and is now completely useless. The wristband also cracked after only a month. The construction of the unit doesn't seem up to par and I found the buttons to be fiddley and unresponsive. Also the software seemed slow with a lot of waiting when switching between screens. It does the basics well though - the footpod and chestband both worked fine and I found it to be pretty accurate for measuring heartrate, distance and speed. However, until they sort out the reliability problems I have a hard time recommending this unit."
4,Good watch,"This is a good entry level watch for a runner that wants to follow their HR during runs. The watch is only moderately complex. The numbers are legible. The basic kit comes with a strap, the sd kit comes with the footpod.You really need to buy into the HR zones to get the full function of this watch. Otherwise, it may be a bit of overkill. The polar website has some additional instructions that help with this."
5,Great product,"I bought this product and i have to say that i'm completely satisfied. It has a lot of functions (i'm still discovering all that) and it is easy to use. It shows me my heart rate, speed, distance, all i need to control my running. I feel very animated to running with that and all the information it gives me. I recommend it for all who like running. The footpod is a bit bigger that i was expecting, but it isn't heavy at all and it don't bother anyway while running. It gives confiable measures after calibrating. Great product!"
4,Works Well,"This watch/heart monitor is just what I expected. Comes with all the features I was looking for. As other reviews have mentioned it is a bit complex at the beginning. But stick with it and it will be easy to use in no time. I would have preferred the red version, however purchased the black one because at the time the red was $50 more. Same features different color shouldn't cost that much more. I'm not a stupid consumer."
4,was ok,"I use sprayway products for just about everything. Now, i can't give this product a fair review because i did not use it for my automobile, yet i used it for my house carpet. It did not really remove the stains off a light beige carpet, but it did help lift them a little bit.. I used it as a pre treatment before shampooing. I can see how it would work better for automobile carpet since that kind of carpet is dense. wanted to leave a review so that people who were buying it for home use would have an idea of what it might do.."
3,MS VPC is Free to Download,Hopefully you have read this far in the reviews; FYI you can download MS VPC for free from Microsoft directly.
4,Works for me,"These tapes work well - have had no problems whatsoever. In the absence of TiVo and DVD Recorders, blank VHS tapes like this one does the job."
4,Pleased!,"Tape worked well -- no problem. It's hard to find VHS tapes, so I was pleased. And they arrived promptly."
5,SONY 8HRS,I like the 8hrs. Can't even find the 6hr tapes anymore. Guess it's time for me to move into the right time zone & get a dvr. My order was promptly delivered.
2,good tape to use for beginners..,tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper.i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you.but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality.
1,Don't buy this Cascade--ever!,"I've used Cascade for years, but this new one--Cascade powder with Dawn--is awful. White residue on everything and, yes, I've cleaned my dishwasher with CLR, prewashed dishes, adjusted whatever I could and the results are the same. The Cascade website admits to--literally--a 1% satisfaction rate. Beware!"
5,amazing,Great book with an extraordinary plot line... absolutely amazing and genuine to the core. The characters evoke emotions that books now a days only wish they could compare to.
3,"Great soundtracks, average quality","Glad that these songs are available on a commercially-produced CD. That said, I was a bit disappointed that the sound source for these CDs is a print of the film, rather than the original source.If you have video tapes of these pictures already, you already know what these CDs sound like. Grainy, dull, but thankfully (what I've heard so far) no sprockets torn or frames missing.If you're hoping for a clean source recording of this material, this ain't it. But if you want all the musical bits from these films on one collection, then the price is right. Original source material or not, the songs and performances are fantastic."
3,Fred and Ginger fans take note...,"Fred and Ginger fans take note...Re-recording of music from their classic films has been released. If you are a fan of the period, this is a good cd for you. Through remastered, some songs still suffer a bit in translation. Personally, I'd rather just watch these scenes on video but if you are a diehard fan, you'll love such classics as ""Let's Face The Music And Dance"" and ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"""
4,A Subject for Talk Radio,"This is the second try..for some reason it disappeared. I cannot actually review the book now having just ordered it. I will, however. There is a popular, but controversial, Talk Radio program hosted by a guy..who is equally He is planning to discuss your book tomorrow.( February 18) His name is Jay Severin, and he hosts the program from 2;00P.M - 6:oo PM Monday - Friday. He can be witty and/or sarcastic..but always enjoyable The call letters are WTKK, numbers 96.9,,web site WTKK Boston Talks. He has his own blog there. He is smart, funny and I listen daily. If you ever read this..he'd love to hear from you ! He says your book is his favorite funny book ..a compliment as he's a very bright guy, and ,if you are still living in Massachusetts..he lives here too..North Shore..It's makes for a good time.If you miss the show..get onto his blog, or call the station [...]"
4,must have,Like other reviewers have said this is not a scare tactic book. The book explains why smokers believe they smoke and the some funny excuses we use so we can continue to smoke. I would say quiting for me wasnt as easy as the book described but it isnt as hard as i thought it would be. I have quit so many times but this time is the last time.
5,The EASY WAY TO STOP SMOKING,"BOOK WAS RECEIVED IN GREAT SHAPE. This was a great price. I hope my husband will read it . I have heard that it works, we will see."
5,it works,Six months so far....it really is the best best mothod I have used.....different approach.....do it.
4,It works,"My husband wanted this book and it worked for both of us. We both managed to quit 6 weeks ago. However you NEED to actually want to quit for the book to help you at all. And don't go into this believing that you won't have a craving and that you will just lay them down, walk away and never think of them again (and be happy about it). It doesn't work like that. More than anything it forces you to pick a quit date (the day you finish the book)."
4,Easy Way to Stop Smoking,Purchased this book for my husband who was determined that he could quit smoking on his own. It worked for my daughter and she swore by the book. Looks like it worked for my husband too
5,An amazing tool if you are ready to quit!,"This book will restore hope to anyone that has failed to quit in the past. It's an extremely easy read, from the perspective of someone that has been where you are. The magic, to me, was in the approach. If you want to understand the 'why' behind smoking, and overcome your addiction logically; look no further. This book is a life changer, and asks for no upfront commitment on your part; the author asks you continue smoking during the read. By the end of the book, when he asks you to light your last cigarette - you won't want to. I promise."
5,Great tool!!,This has helped me and several of my friends to quit smoking. Great way to prepare to quit smoking.
4,It worked for me.,"This book assisted me in breaking out of the mental bubble I was in. I knew the risks of smoking but chose to justify it rather than face up to the truth. It helped me understand the facts, about myself and cigarettes. Looking at it honestly has stopped the brainwashing that took place over the years. I recommend this book to anybody that has a desire to quit."
5,Yippie! I'm a NonSmoker!,"I smoked for 15 years even with chronic asthma. I tried to quit 13 times, but it was this book that helped me stop smoking. I can't say anything better than the other 500+ five star reviews of this book. I just wanted to add my success to the group! Hooray for Allen Carr! Hooray for this book! I'm free!"
5,The Easy Way to Stop Smoking,"This really works! No cravings, no regrets. I'm ecstatic! At last I'm free! The book delivered all it promised and I've tried and tried other ways to quit."
4,Hope it is effective,Book seems fine. I hope it is effective as well as it did for the friend that suggested teh book to me.
2,Not great,"I read the reviews and thought this book would be great. It's not. It's very redundant and telling me 100 times it's easy to quit smoking doesn't make it easier.In the first chapter, the author tells you he got hypnotized and quit smoking. My question is ""then why should I listen to your quit smoking method? Shouldn't I just get hypnotized?""I read the book and got little out of it. I got hypnotized and I haven't smoked for a week now."
3,the easy way to stop smoking,"it is a good book, long storie before the author comes to the point. i am not sure if it helps me, because i already quit smoking, but i heard from other people that this book convinced them in a way"
1,Useless,"Don't buy this book without reading the reviews that give 1 and 2 stars - there is nothing revealing or revolutionary in this book. It is short, useless and doesn't ACTUALLY tell you HOW to smoke smoking!"
5,Works if you really want to quit,"This book works....But, sometimes you gotta read the book more than once. Also, make sure you read the ENTIRE book within 3-5 days. If you take longer than that, it loses its effectiveness.If you can't quit.. just keep reading it. You will be able to quit.Everyone I've given this book to have succeeded."
5,All smokers need to read this book.,"My good friend recommended this book to me and reading it is the best thing I have ever done. All smokers know why they should not smoke. Yet, they do. This book does not dwell on just the reasons why you should not smoke. More importantly it helps you understand why you do smoke. With that knowledge you can stop. It is that simple. Read it, and afterwards the choice is yours."
5,yay!,"Both my husband and I were serious smokers. One day on holiday I picked up this book, and stopped smoking the Allen Carr way (ie EASY!) - then my husband read it. Neither of us have ever looked back - and this was in 1989!!!! Just think, we would have smoked for another 14 years to date if we hadn't stopped then. I have bought and given countless of these books away to friends.Read it all - and enjoy the freedom."
5,Free at last,"After 35 years of smoking and spending thousands of dollars trying to quit, this book was given to me as a gift. The day after I read this book I have been free of this deadly addiction since. It has now been 7 months and I will never smoke again. Thank you Allen Carr for giving me back my life."
3,Good book,"I think this book has some excellent points in it, however I did not quit smoking. I think knowing ahead of time that I would have to quit smoking when I finished the book made me nervous the entire time I was reading it. I read it pretty fast and when I got to the end I wished I had taken my time reading it because I wasn't ready to quit yet. When I decide to quit smoking again I will re read the book and I think it will really help me out when I am ready. If you plan to quit smoking and are truly ready to do so then I recomend purchasing the book and also taking your time while reading it. GOOD LUCK"
5,This book is magical!!,"I started reading this book with no intention on wanting to let go of my smoking habit. However, I finished the book yesterday, and today is the first day out of 16 years that I had zero puffs without any cravings! This is amazing! No matter how much you smoke or how little you want to quit. YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!!!"
5,WoW!,"I saw this book in the mall as well, thought, ""yeah, right!"" When I started reading it, I thought, hey, this might actually work!! When I realized that, I had to put it down for a week because I knew I would have to stop smoking when I finished it! (If you read this book, you will realize how silly and ironic that statement is!) The de-brainwashing methed is highly effective -- I don't even miss the smelly cigarettes at all. Great book, even if you ""don't"" want to quit!"
2,Ummm...its a start.,Okay. So I tried this book about a year ago and it helped me quit for a few days. It didn't really address the important psychological aspects for intellectuals like me. The book Quit Snap has been the most useful (I was able to quit after reading it).
3,Mostly A Self Promotion Book,"The Easyway method achieved it's goal. The goal is not to get you to quit, but to shamelessly advertise itself. It's secondary goal is to make smoking seem disgusting. I read the book twice, and I'm still puffing away. Except now I feel subhuman and stupid when I smoke. Alan Carr's method is good, but there is not much meat to it. To truly get someone to quit, I think the book needs to keep the reader's attention better. The first 100 pages or so is all about how good the method is. There's literally about 40 or 50 pages of actual instruction on what to do. The Easyway may work for you but it just makes me want to smoke more."
1,Doesn't help if you actually enjoy smoking!,"I had high hopes for this book, but it didn't help me at all since it didn't address the one reason I smoke - I really enjoy it!I read the book twice, hoping I messed something the first time around, but I didn't."
4,I never got it.,"I ordered this book after hearing so many positive reviews about it, but it never came! I told the buyer the dailydeal and they refunded my order cost right away including shipping. Kinda a bummer but I can always reorder and hope lighting wont strike twice. I have been lucky to not have needed this book and still quit ciggs cold turkey 2 weeks in counting..."
2,The easy way to stop smoking,"I wasn't impressed at all with this book. I read the reviews before I bought so thought it was a good one. A lot of repetition, nothing wedon't already know. He did say at one point he went to a hypnotist andquit, so thats what I did and that has worked. Two weeks so far and joined a group for extra support. You really have to be ready."
3,OK but repetitive,"Once you've read the first chapter, you've read the whole book. It's a very good way to look at your habit but you won't quit smoking just by reading the book and the withdrawal effects will still be present and very strong. The only way to kick this habit it to quit cold turkey (which the book suggests) and sleep for 24 hours a day for a week. Even then, it will still be painful and you will still be tempted for months if not years. Sorry, just the way it's going to be if you're a long time smoker."
4,Helped me,"There is one line in this book that says it all. ""A cigarettes only job is to make you want another cigarette"". Reallyrang true with me. Now you don't need to buy the book!! ;-)"
5,"Wow, it works!","I've now given this book to eight of my friends who smoke. Five of them have quit for good. One is reading the book as I write this. This is a no-nonsense, non-scare tactic way to quit if you really want to quit. He really breaks your addiction down simply and and effectively. If you truly want to quit (a lot of smokers say they do, but they don't, actually) this book should do the trick."
5,It worked!,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he quit before he even finished reading it, after numerous failed attempts. This time it stuck, he doesn't miss cigarettes. We've since ordered copies for his parents and our friends."
5,Free at last!!!!,"I found this book when I wasn't even ready to quit smoking. I was convinced that I was never going to be able to quit. I tried every treatment possible, hypnosis, accupunture, medicine, even shots and I always went back to smoke. In January 10th I celebrated 2 years of not smoking and I did it thanks to having the opportunity of reading this wonderful book. If you are struggling with quitting, please buy the book, take it from a 23+ years heavy smoker who quit without trouble and is still strong and determined. Good luck!!!!"
5,Don't think this is just another gimmick!,"This book really puts smoking in a new perspective, one that I believe to be the most reasonable one. I read this book with an open mind and it worked in a pinch. It has many revolutionary points, which are drilled into your head through repitition and real life examples. After the book, with no hesitaion, my Marlboro Lights pack went on a one-way trip to the trash can. I then just stopped, and for a long time reflected on the cigarette that started it all, how smoking has interfered with my life each day, and most of all, what a waste it was! Bought 3 more copies for co-workers and family."
5,"1 year and 6 months, still a non smoker!","I smoked for 10 years and bought this book and I stopped smoking the first time. It has been almost 4 years and I will never miss smoking. I gave the book to all of my smoker friends and almost all of them quit as well. This book does not brainwash you because when you are a smoker, you have already brainwashed yourself into thinking you need to smoke. I wish I could give this book to every smoker on the planet. Allen Carr knows what he is talking about."
5,Well done!,"This is a great book! Anyone who wants to quit smoking should read this and ""Never Smoke Again: The top 10 ways to stop smoking now and forever."" With these books, you are armed to beat this devastating addiction."
5,High Return on Investment,"The author reminds tobacco users of the insanethinking which accompanies the insidious habit.Logical thinking seems to out-perform drugs,potents, hypnosis and other less successfulquit-smoking therapies.I had decided to quit smoking 'cold turkey' aboutfive days before I received the book; however, Iread it anyway and it reinforced my resolve.I haven't smoked in over a month now and it didn'thurt me one bit.In fact, after 35 years of smoking up to 2 packsper day, I enjoy full breathing again; I enjoy thetaste of food more; and, my energy level at agefifty-eight has sky-rocketed to pre-40 levels.I recommend ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" by AllenCarr to anyone who is ready to break out of thetobacco prison and start enjoying life again.Two thumbs up!JG-Hooks, TX"
5,How SIMPLY AMAIZING...,"It worked for me. I did not believe it will, because on page 160 I was smoking and thinking that this book isn't helping me, few pages and 15 minutes later I simply quit. It was similar to jumping in a cool water - you have to make yourself to jump. Give yourself a chance."
5,Free yourself!,"I read this book and wish I could hug the writer Allen Carr. I smoked for 16 years but after this book, no more, no way!! It is the best money I have spent in a long time. I tried to quit several times before, ""tried"" being the key word, after this book there is no ""trying"" ONLY succeeding! I love being free of cigarettes. Even if you are skeptical, read this book if you smoke. After reading, you will be ready to quit for good!"
3,eh...,"I don't know if I should be jealous of or angry at the other reviews. I read the book 3 times, Iagree with everything he says yet I don't feel as though quitting smoking has become EASY and itcertainly is NOT fun. I am still smoking even though I truly want to quit. The addiction part is inperspective and perhaps, after the fourth read something magical will happen and I will smoke mylast cigarette.I gave the book 3 stars because I can see how it can be helpful to some."
2,"Good in theory, but doesn't work in practice (for me)","I've ready this book three times now, each time in the hope of miraculously not wanting/needing to smoke when I got to the end. And it has never worked for more than a few hours for me.I never had that ""a-hah"" moment while I was reading, and although it all made sense, it was never powerful enough for me to quit.I have since started on the medication Champix, and have quit for over two weeks now and everything's going well.This book is definitely work a try because it does work for a lot of people, unfortunately I just wasn't one of them."
4,Nothing has helped want to quit more,"Though I have not finished the book yet ( if you get a copy you'll know why) it has been a wake up call that I've needed for a long time! The pointing out of obvious psychological triggers has made me become aware of them. In reading you will definitely have a greater understanding of this disgusting sidekick we carry with us, to make it easy is just a side product of the easy way., I can't wait till I am through this entire book ... Then no doubtely I will use it as a reference book."
5,Best buy,"I have never left a review for Amazon, but I read themA lot so here is my two cents. This book is amazing. It's fromSomeone who actually knows what he is talking about and has extremely valid points. I had smoked for 5 years and stopped smoking around page 90 of this book with no regret or feeling of bring deprived. He just puts it in to such a simple aspect that it is hard to understand why you ever smoked before. Now when I see people smoke I feel bad for them and want to lecture them. Even though smokers HATE that.I'd highly advised this book for anyone who wants to quit and is sick of being tied down to cigarettes."
4,It was a gift,"I purchased this for a friend who had used the book before with good results. After falling 'off the wagon' he didn't have time to sit and read, so this was used instead and once again he was able to stop smoking within a week. It doesn't appear to have been as effective as reading the book had been, he is fighting cravings more this time, but it did get him to stop smoking when nothing else seemed to work."
5,It worked!,It worked! I no longer have the desire to smoke. No nicotine substitutes of any kind. I recommend the book to anyone.
5,30 years & stopped overnight!,"I can't recommend this book enough. I smoked for 30 years and stopped overnight with no withdrawals... Yup.. None... Never missed it... I haven't smoked in almost three years now and know that I never will again... I look at people huddled outside resturants etc trying to get a quick smoke in, and feel sorry for them... I want to tell them all how easy it is if you understand WHAT causes your addiction... Alan Carr explains this beautifully and makes stopping smoking a painless, even pleasurable experience... I owe him my life... Or at least the extended portion of it."
5,Probably the best way to stop smoking,"Take my word for it. If you really want to stop smoking, read the book, understand it and follow the instructions exactly. Soon you will be free from nicotine slavery."
5,Seems like magic!,"I bought this for a friend's 60th birthday. He said that the day he turned 60, he would not be a smoker anymore. I gave it to his wife to give to him. They read it together and poof, neither one of them seems to have any problem at all with not smoking. I can't wait to get this book for myself and my husband!"
5,5 months and counting!,"I quit 5 months ago using the prescription drug Chantix and about a week later I read this book. The medication certainly helped me quit, but it was this book that helped me realize there was no reason to be miserable about it, and that life was not less enjoyable because i had ""given up"" smoking. I've read the book twice now cover to cover. The 2nd time i highlighted key sentances that helped me. It's been 5 months and I still reference those highlighted phrases when I feel like I'm somehow struggling being a non-smoker. Every time I reference those parts it makes it a lot easier to stay quit. It really is getting easier as time goes by. To summarize, Chantix helped me quit, but this book is the sole reason I stayed quit!"
5,Amazing Book,I truly love this book. It creates the right mind set for the motivated person to successfully quit and just like the book says - even makes it enjoyable. No BS. I've been smoke free for a month and haven't wanted a single cigarette since I smoke the last one - per the books instructions. Get the book. If it doesn't work then you are no worse off than before - but if it does - you've just saved yourself a boat load of money and freed yourself from the prison of smoking. Can't recommend this book highly enough!
5,The Book Title Says It All,"I have an app on my phone that tells me how many cigs I haven't smoked and how much I saved. It has been 1 year 24 weeks since I quit. I have not smoked 15,992 cigarettes and I have saved $4264. And it is all because I read this book. If you are ready to quit, here is the way to do it."
5,Really helps!,"I've tried to quit smoking so often with so many methods, but this is working. It gives you a much better way of thinking about the process. Great book!"
5,Smoke free for over a year and a half thanks to this book.,"This book helped with fighting the mental blocks and war before finally quiting. I've been smoke free for a year and a half and cant beleive I ever let smoking for 10 years control my life. Great book, highly recommended."
4,Brilliant book,easy way is the way it really helps a lot I haven't finished as yet but has started working for me :-) I advise anyone looking to stop smoking for good to ready this book
4,Helpful,"I am so happy for all of the people who read this book and find success. I knew that quitting smoking was not going to be easy, but after reading this book and other reviews, I thought I wouldn't have much problem handling it. I have been reading it again. This is NOT easy (for me). I think his book is wonderful because he understands the addiction and is not preachy, he's like a supportive friend. I will say he has given me a new perspective, and I think that many people can benefit from this but do not go into it thinking it's not going to take some work."
5,My sister is now a non-smoker after 20 years,"I bought this for my sister and it helped her quit after 20 years of heavy smoking (atleast half a pack a day starting first thing in the morning). The title sounds rediculous and I'm not a fan of self help books in general but I took a chance on it because of the great reviews on amazon. This book did what 20 yrs of me nagging her to quit and angry spats could not accomplish. She had tried to quit 3 times before without much success but after 4 months of letting the book sit on her shelf, she got a prescription for chantix (nicotine inhibitor) and read the book. She has tried other prescriptions, patches and gums before and none of them worked. I don't know how much chantix helped her but she is convinced she could not have done it without the book. Whatever combination it was, I am greatful to Allen Carr."
5,best 99 cents ever spent!,"I know it's a little more expensive here. I bought this book at the garage sale and April 6th 2011 was my last cigaret and I never looked back! My roommate was a smoker in the house, my boss smoked in the car, most of my friends are smokers. And when I quit they were all telling me how much will power I had, I just smiled and said ""it's not will power it's the book. Read it""It does changes your mind about smoking. It doesn't make you a victim but a victor over your addiction. A lot of other people said that half way though they wanted to quit and so did I. Give it a try you have nothing to loose but FREEDOM to gain from an addiction."
5,Amazing,"Half way through this book I never wanted to smoke another cigarette. I couldnt believe it was that simple..this guy is a genius. A must read for all smokers that feel trapped by those killer sticks. After almost 20 years at a pack a day or more, I finished the book and the desire to smoke was gone. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!"
4,Never thought i could do it,It cut through all the misinformation smokers tell each other about why they should keep smoking even though all smokers wish to be free of the ugly habit. Thanks for this book!!
2,This guy needs an editor,"I got this book after reading so many great reviews of how it helped people quit. Well, I have no idea how they even got through this waste of paper. At first I thought it was just me, not paying attention to where I left off, but then I saw that some pages were exactly the same, word for word. How many times can you tell someone smoking is disgusting and you don't need willpower to quit? Apparently many. The repetition in this book made me so angry at the poor quality, I wanted to smoke more. This guy is a joke- He quit smoking through hypnosis and now he thinks he knows all the secrets? Um, no. He is just trying to make money (and apparently its working) off people willing to try any way to quit.I almost feel guilty trying to re-sell this book and get some of my money back..."
1,Save your money,"This book was alright, if you don't mind reading the same thing over and over and over. I keept trying to find what the ""easyway"" actually was. There really isn't an answer to that question. Carr tells about how bad smoking is, how no one needs to smoke, etc. Things smokers already know. He says not to use willpower, but the ""easyway"" is nothing more than willpower with a fancy name."
2,The Easy Way to Stop Smoking: Join the Millions Who Have Become Non-smokers Using Allen Carr's Easy Way Method,The author wrote for 100 pages about himself and how great he was. After that I threw up.
1,didn't help,"I used to smoked forever, was a chain smoker, and couldn't stop, was getting sick a lot, didn't feel good physically or emotionally. Really wanted to quit smoking but I was powerless. Only God knows what I have tried. Read this book but didn't help either, I think I was too screwed and used smoking to cope with my daily stresses and any uncomfortable feelings. Then a friend of mine recommended Nicotine Anonymous, a self-supporting 12 step program pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous. !2 step program is the fastest growing spiritual program in the world and the most effective for any addiction, compulsion and psychological dysfunction. Long story short I did quit smoking, and changed my life for the better because I use the tools of this program in my everyday live. The point of this program is you're powerless over your addiction, so you need to reach out to some sort of higher power for help. It's humbling but it works. Good luck everyone and I hope you have a smoke free life!"
5,Best $ I've ever spent in my life,"22 years I smoked! TWENTY-TWO! I don't do drugs, drink and I thought, "" I can smoke....it's my only vice.....I like smoking!...why should I quit?"" I truly believed that I liked to smoke. Until I read this book. It spells it out. I quit smoking even before I finished the book although it encourages you to smoke during it. Buy it! This is my first online review too. I am that passionate about it. If it worked for me...it will work for you!"
5,Made me quit....,"My husband and I knew we should have quit smoking YEARS ago. He saw Ashton on Leno and told me to order the book. Well, the book(s) arrived and he finished his in less than a week- obviously the smoking stopped also. I can't say I was ""ready"" to quit (we ALL KNOW we never will be) but I read it anyway. I'll admit, it was tough, but if you make it past the first month you're golden!!!!!Highly recommended!!!!! This book is probably the only way we ever would have quit smoking! One word of warning- pay attention to your weight gain! That's the worst part of quitting."
4,Helped me quit,"I purchased a few books on quitting smoking but this one had the most impact on my decision to quit. Although I did not agree with Mr. Carr's presentation 100%, I was able to incorporate a great deal of his approach into my own program. I definately think reading this book helped me to finally put the cigarettes down. I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about quitting. It will help you to change your perception of why you smoke which will make stopping a whole lot easier."
5,The EasyWay is the Best Way,This book is great - as crazy as it sounds it really works. Myself and friends have used this book to stop smoking. I've been smoke free for six months after smoking for 24 years. It's fabulous! I bought this book for another friend who was so pleased with our sucess that she wants to join us and stop smoking too.
5,Another quitter : ),"The only time quitters ever win !!! 30 year ex-smoker, thanks to Allen Carr !!! Brilliant... What more can I say... Oh yea, read the book : ) hugs"
4,Quit,"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in quitting smoking for good. Although quite repetitive, it really is effective."
5,The only thing you need to quit smoking.,"The best way to stop smoking is by quitting once and for all. This book explains why and how. Follow it and you won't be an ""ex-smoker""; you will be a non-smoker: you will live as if you had never smoked."
3,Trying,"Makes sense, but still haven't stopped...it wasn't the miracle cure. But it is me not the book/author. Still trying. I'll reread it."
5,Nicotine Addiction Stopped Dead In It's Tracks,"I had been smoking for 30 years. A pack and a half to two packs a day is what I was up too until I found this book on Amazon. One of the best things about Allen's book is that he wants you to continue smoking while reading the whole thing. Which for smoker's is a relief because there is no pressure put on you from the onset to quit. Smoke as much as you want while reading this book, it is one of the rules listed at the beginning. So I smoked as much as I wanted too while I read it. At the end of the book...I was done smoking on the day of my choosing. If you want or need to quit smoking, this is a wonderful way to do just that. Your life, health, and happiness is worth far more than the nominal price of this amazing book. Thank you Allen, for helping me to stop destroying my health."
2,lhooka,I'm half way through but it is enough. Useless and boring. If you were/are a light smoker (5-7/day) and you enjoyed them you won't find much on this book. If you begin to read it as you already quit smoking looking for motivation and support you better go out and spend your money in nicotine gums and patches. There are good chances that this bad review come from the lack of nicotine ;)
3,Condition of Book,Book was Awesome but looked like it had been folded in half before or during shipping. Didnt affect content it just looked damaged.
5,It Is True. It Is Easy!,"Yes, I too was skeptical. I thought, 'I am sick of being so unhealthy and especially sick of being a social outcast. Let's try it.' To my surprise it worked and it worked wonderfully. In Allen Carr's book you will find the key to deprogramming all the negativity that you have associated with ""giving up"" smoking. You will find the secret to your own success. I had tried everything and had failed in misery previously with ""Easy Way"" I became a non-smoker and enjoyed the entire process. I know it is hard to believe, I didn't believe it when a friend recommended the book to me but it's true. Read it and you will never regret it and your family will love you all the more for it. I'll wish you good luck though you won't need it!"
5,I quit,I read this book over 2 years ago. I stumbled upon this book in the library and hadn't really intended on quitting. I read the book not taking it seriously but by the end of the book I was ready to quit! I just knew I would never smoke again. I still had half a pack left. It was my ninth time trying to quit and it was easy. I didn't gain any weight either. It sat on my counter for a week. I forgot it was even there. I gave a copy of this book to a friend and she quit too. I never think about ciggerettes anymore and certainly don't miss it. I highly recommened this book. It probably saved my life.
4,I quit smoking.,"This book was self-helpy past the point that I would typically enjoy and I didn't enjoy the repetition of the ideas, but it worked. I really did quit smoking and it really is because of things that Allen Carr's book highlighted for me. Depending on where you live, it's the same cost as two or three packs of smokes and has saved me [as of this writing] 45 packs of cigarettes."
4,I bought this based on sooooo many positive reviews....,"and after reading the first few chapters, feel I can do it but am finding myself just not ready so I set it aside. I know I shouldn't, but there you go. It is sitting next to me now, not out of site but I plan on reading from cover to cover in one sitting. I do hope it helps and I am sure it is mind control..... got to do it!"
5,"Cheapest,easiest way to stop","I've been a non smokerfor 6 weeks now.This book is every bit as amazing as claimed. I doesn't force you to quit, but it does make it pretty easy. thanks amazon for offering this great product at your always low price."
5,Best method yet!,"I've tried patches, pills, hypnosis, acupuncture, you name it! This book was awesome. I read it, stopped smoking when I finished the book, and haven't looked back since. I highly recommend it for smokers and even non-smokers who are friends with a smoker. It really puts the addiction into perspective and helps us understand why we keep doing it and how easy it is to actually stop. Thank you Allen Carr!"
5,This book changed the way I view smoking,"When I first heard about this book I was skeptical to say the least, but after it worked for about ten of my friends, I decided to give it a try. I finished the book on August 23rd 2011 and haven't looked back. I have not had or wanted to have a cigarette in almost 2 months and it feels wonderful! I was smoking a pack a day, sometimes more, for almost 12 years. I never thought I would quit but I did. I let my boyfriend, who was also smoking almost 2 packs a day, borrow it and he too has now quit. My only con was buying it on the kindle app on my iphone made some numbers not come up, they were just blank little boxes, but that is nothing big! Pick it up if you are tired of smoking. What have you got to lose?"
5,a 10 out of 5 stars,"this book is not a dream, it works. I havent smoked in half a year. I still work in a bar, and i am a non smoker, very nice book."
5,I quit!,"I totally credit this book with helping me to finally quit. I had tried it all, and finally cracked the book open. I haven't had a cigarette in over 3 years and RARELY think about them. Losing the constant train of thought and cravings was truly the best part. I buy copies of this book for the cigarette smokers I love and want to support in their efforts."
5,AMAZING EXCEPT WRONG VERSION,"I became a non-smoker after i read this book and I've been smoking for 13 years. The only thing I would caution you against is that this version does not doesn't display numbers - so buy this version:The Easyway to Stop Smokinginstead.If you read this and don't at least give the book a try it means you're not mentally prepared to stop smoking. It's easy though - please just spend the $8 - same price as a pack of smokes. This book will save your life.If you buy it and don't finish it that means you're scared of finishing it because you know what comes at the end..NON SMOKER.All I have to say (and I promise these are my own words): YIPPEE I'M A NON-SMOKER, I COULDN'T BE MORE HAPPY ABOUT IT AND IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN EASIER.I'd love to talk to anyone who thinks otherwise. Just comment saying ""I don't believe it"""
5,Worked for me!,"It has been 30 days since I finished the book. And 31 days since my last smoke. While reading the book, my way of thinking about smoking changed. By the time I finished the book, I was already a non-smoker. I really didn't have a lot of faith when I bought the book, but thought what the heck, it costs about the same as 2 packs of cigarettes. If it works, it will be worth it.And it was so worth it! I went through a big crisis 2 weeks ago. My first reaction was to think, ""I need a smoke."" And then I started thinking of what I had read and learned...that it won't make my problem any better, it won't make me feel any better, when I am done with the smoke, I will still have this crisis in my life etc etc. And I didn't even think about smoking again.I am a non-smoker! YAY!"
1,Well - that didn't work,I had high hopes for this one! Read once - nothing. Twice - nothing. Listened to both CDs several times - nothing All the information is regurgitated over and over. We've heard it all elsewhere too. I am just one. Try it if you like.
3,Mediocrity,"The book purports to offer a system, but just repeats the same information over and over. It offers very little in the way of a systematic approach to quitting smoking."
2,EASY WAY????,"I kept waiting to hear how it would be easy. On and ON and On with the same points over and over. Some of the book has some sound bits of general information on nicotine addiction. But it's really nothing we smokers don't already know. I am desperate to quit smoking, and I was really hoping this was it. It certainly was not. There is no magic ""EASY WAY"" He basically touts, just stop smoking and be glad about it."
2,Not a success story,"I was very hopeful upon receiving this book however and read it with an open mind but after completion I am no closer to 'snuffing out'. Everything Mr. Carr says in the book regarding smokers; I'm an addict, a social outcast, disgusting, etc are all things I'm already aware of. I feel I didn't get any new information or an ""aha moment"". His arrogance and repetition did annoy me though. I'm not sure how this method is helping so many people. I want to quit smoking but sincerely find it to be a pleasurable activity; it does not taste gross to me. I will begin to explore other options."
1,"should be titled ""my easy way to make money""","If you want to hear all about how successful the author was in writing the book, how nasty and disgusting cigarettes are, and reading over and over that you can live without them (really? no kidding*), this is the book for you. I put down the book after struggling to read the first 3/4ths of it. As for as for easyway methods for quiting.. maybe it was written on the last page, I didn't get that far. I quit using Smoke Away sold at Walmart. It really worked!! Its all natural and doesn't put more nicotine in you and you don't have to listen to any ""former smoker"" lecturing."
5,Smoke Free!!!,"I actually was purchasing this book for my sister. I bought the book for myself over two years ago. I would stand outside on my patio, puffing away, reading my ""quit-smoking"" book. When I finally finished the book, I went out to have my final cigarette and to dispose of the 4-5 packs I had left in my carton. I stepped outside, lit up and about half a cigarette later decided I didn't want to be a smoker anymore so I put the cigarette out and threw everything away. The next day I felt a little off because my routine was different, I had more free time. No more 10 minutes here, 10 minutes there to go smoke. Instead, by the end of the day I had an extra hour or so to relax. As each day went by I felt better and better- still going strong.If you read the book, and take what he says seriously, you can quit. It's that easy."
5,Good Investment,I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone who needs to improve their keyboard skills. I actually purchased the entire set and it has really helped my church rhythm section to be able to play all of the modern styles found in today's worship music. Definitely check it out!
2,Way Under the Radar,I bought this DVD to see more of a spot I surfed in Morocco.. Having a lot of local knowledge of the area it really clued me in to how bad this movie was edited.. And the Indo part just made me turn it off because it was so bad. Not a very positive surf movie..
1,Boring,"I bought this video in preparation for a trip to Morocco. I expected a modern day adventure, some beautiful scenery, and local culture. The movie is pretty much solid surfing. Brief comments by the surfers are inane, there is no interaction with locals, and no historic or cultural context. There isn't even a sense of journey, just hanging out on the beach and watching wave after wave after wave ... . Monotonous, and disappointing."
4,Nice speakers,"For the price the sound quality is good, haven't had a chance to bury it in the ground yet, just tested it out indoors and it sounds good. Can't complaint, it will serve it's purpose as ambiance in the backyard when we have our barbeques on the deck."
3,OK Speakers for the Money... Some Great Things,"What I like about the speakers:LONG cables includedThey appear to be well builtThey are inexpensiveWhat I don't like about the speakers:The sound is not great (ok, I am spoiled as I have expensive speakers at home)They don't sound as loud as other speakers for the same size of a receiver, so you really need to crank up the volume to get something audibleOverall they are OK if you have modest expectations"
4,Tic Speakers,They work very good. Not as loud as I would like but they do work well for the price. I would buy more and I reccomend them to anyone wanting a good deal.
1,Defective speaker in less than 1 year,"I've had this set of speakers for less than 1 year and 1 speaker has already gone bad. Can't get a full sound out of it, only treble."
4,Great Frozen Pizza Plate,My husband and I fight over this plate when we have frozen pizza. A Tombstone pizza fits great on this plate!
1,waffling bollocks,"Bannon writes haphazardly and with no structure whatsoever, all he seems to be concerned with is filling the pages of his borderland history with insignificant missionary characters who play little part in the development of the Spanish frontier. The book is boring and very disjointed and difficult to read."
3,Good for beginners,"After my 10+ year cycling career, having raced in Italy, this book added very little to my knowledge. It tells some good stuff about crosswinds and echelons, but I think that Boresewick's Road Bicycle Racing is a better book in technics and tatics than this book.If you are an novice or cat.4 this book may add a lot to your know-how! Since this is not expensive, it's worth giving an try. If you are an old-cycling-man like me, leave it alone."
3,mildly entertaining. some good things. but not that great,If you are a beginner it is probably a pretty good book. If you have lots of experience and have read other things then you probably won't find many new ideas or concepts. It is mildly entertaining and I guess it just gets you thinking about strategy and reviewing different scenarios. So from that perspective it is ok. Its kind of written haphazardly like ideas went from the brain to the pen as they came up.
4,Pretty Good,"Decent introduction to a number of tactics that are key to organized bicycle racing. If nothing else, it'll help you understand what's going on when you watch racing on TV.Obviously, the best way to learn all of this is to go out and ride/race with others more knowledgeable than yourself, but this will at least get you started."
2,Great conductor - poor orchestra,"This recording was among the early studio versions; consequently, there was not much for comparison at the time (Bernstein, Leinsdorf, Scherchen, Barbirolli, and Adler). The first notes expose the weaknesses of the Utah symphony. Rather than a forceful beginning, the result is weak and almost indecisive. The real deficiencies of the orchestra becomes even more apparent in the slow movement and in the high string open sections in the last movement. The middle movements are ordered: scherzo, andante. Throughout I found the orchestral balances to be the most annoying aspect of this performance. Other than the pacing within the movements, I was not impressed with much by the recording. Now with more than 100 recordings of the 6th, this one lags far behind."
4,Hodgson Mill WW Pasta,"Nutritious and health pasta to enjoy any time.It sticks if not eaten right away, regardless we like and enjoy it very much."
5,"My family, including 3 toddlers, love this pasta!","Don't be concerned that whole grain means it will have a rough texture or objectionable taste. We all love it. It cooks up great, either al dente (slightly firm) or really soft for the kids. The flavor is mild, meaning that you won't think you are eating a piece of 9-grain bread when you eat it. We love that we can feel this to our kids and know that they are getting all the great health benefits of whole grains, as opposed to refined grains in typical pasta. For our 2-year-old twins, we cut the cooked tubes in half, just to be sure they don't choke on the longer pieces of pasta. Everybody perks up when Daddy says, ""How about if we have pasta today?"""
5,Very inspiring message....,"As a healthcare professional, I was very inspired to watch this story unfold. It is almost unreal that there was so much limited knowledge about the heart and not that long ago. We have progressed by leaps and bounds, and it's due to this research that was portrayed in this movie. Great movie!"
4,Pretty good for a made-for-tv film,"The only reason I ended up watching this was because of Alan Rickman. I will watch anything he's in. The actual topic didn't particularly interest me, but I was quickly enveloped in this movie. It really is quite informative and amazing how it was based on a factual event, because its such a historic and important event. Mos Def was actually quite good in this and he and Alan were wonderful to see interact on camera together. It is a quiet little film, but a powerful one."
5,Something The Lord Made,"An awesome picture and worth every minute! I just loved this DVD. Great support of our black brothers and sisters. For those who have an interest in medicine, Vivian will inspire you!Great Picture to have invested in!"
4,First open heart surgery,"The content of this movie was excellent history. The movie itself was rather dark and the words hard to hear. The actual facts that this was the first successful open heart surgery, guided by the genius and courage of the people involved. The fact that it took place in the 1940's and the racial bigotry was painful."
5,Outstanding! Heartwarming. A movie worth watching.,"I saw this last night and will order a DVD for my son's Father's Day gift today. Based on actual events, we might wish that Vivian Thomas had been treated equally during past decades in our culture's evolution. However, as one reviewer noted, his excellence in service and skill was suitably acknowledged at last."
5,SOMETHING THE LORD MADE...... IS SPECTACULAR !!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE, BASED ON A TRUE STORY IS MOVING AND AMAZING, I COULD NOT KEEP MY EYES OFF OF IT..MOS DEF DELIVERS A BRAVADO PERFORMANCE AS LAB TECHNICIAN (VIVIEN THOMAS)WHO WAS ORIGINALLY HIRED AS A JANITOR,AND WHO STRATEGICALLY ASSISTS A HEART SURGEON IN PERFORMING THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL HEART BYPASS, AN EDGE OF YOUR SEAT DRAMA- SET IN THE 1930'S THRU THE 1960'S. ""INFORMATIVE"" ""ENCOURAGING"" AND ""UPLIFTING""!!!!!!"
5,Moving lessons....,This is a story that bears telling over and over again. I'm sure I will be watching this one day with the grandkids to teach them many lessons about hard work and humility.JB
3,Good Story/Very BAD Language!!!,"This is an excellent story of a black man who amid racial inequality helped to pioneer a medical procedure that saved thousands of human lives. But, do not let the title ""Something the Lord Made"" fool you into thinking this is a Christian movie. It is laced with several insults to God's name, the ""F"" word, the ""N"" word & several other curse words. I would have enjoyed and recommended the movie had it not had so much bad language."
4,Christianity never discouraged racism,"This docudrama showed how much the unmentioned undeclared caste system is an integral part of Christianity. IT was very sad to watch one more aspect of christian people and their caste system in full display.Here was a person of alleged low caste where the upper caste christians denied the rights of a lower caste person.The christian caste system is still very much alive in America and the west.. Eve after 300 years after converting to Christianity, white christians hardly marry black christians.This wonderful move is another docudrama of the christian caste system at display.Shame Shame!"
2,Incorrectly rated vudeo,"The acting is well done, at least the part we watched. The beginning said it was rated for all age audiences, but...finally had to turn it off because the bad language increased as it went along and permeated it and distracted from what would have been a good story. I would not have gone past the first few minutes if a young person or teen had been present, but I stuck with it for about 25 minutes. Wish I hadn't! I cannot believe HBO rated this as acceptable for all audiences. I also cannot believe that a professional doctor who is worth anything would lower himself to continual gutter language. Don't buy it unless you are somehow immune to trashy speech. I really resent the fact that the title leads one to believe it is a Christian video, but it is not."
3,Could do without the swearing,"Watched this movie, called ""Something the LORD Made"". I would have enjoyed watching this inspired movie with my daughter WITHOUT the doctor swearing! I wish it was rated, I prob. wouldn't have bought this. Will be giving this DVD away to someone who doesn't mind curse words in a movie."
3,"surprise surprise, the essay was better","The movie is good, probably better if you didn't or don't read the essay in the WP that the movie was made from. I ended up regifting the movie--gave it to mom for mother's day, and that really says it all."
5,"Too little, too late","I know my review rating (5*'s) seems like a mistake. Well, as an African-American male, I appreciate quality knowledge of the past. Without telling the movie, it's great overall. Situations like this one will show blacks aren't ""crying wolf"" when some examples of racism are documented."
5,Excellent historical movie!,"Not only was this movie well-written and well-delivered, but it actually happened, and history was made. To this day, children with Tetralogy of Fallot benefit from the research and medical science rewritten by these two men, and the courage of the first parents, to place their only child in the care of these two mavericks, was beyond comprehension. There is so much to learn from this movie. The quiet demeanor and consistent excellence of Vivien Thomas made groundbreaking strides for advancement of African Americans, and changed the attitudes of the establishment, during a time when Democrats were very much against equality and weren't afraid to show their racism."
5,Great movie...,"In a day we some of us take racial equality more for granted, this wonderfully created movie shows how not too long ago, bigotry was quite the norm. Based on a true store of Dr. Blalock's first open heart surgery, this movie will bring appreciation and inspiration to all ages."
5,Truly Something the Lord Made,"Excellent acting by both the uncomparable Alan Rickman and Mos Def; they stood out in a striking story. The entire movie was memorable, and if you're a fan of either man or movies based on true stories I would highly recommend it."
5,Something the Lord Made,I have not received my two copies of this film that I ordered a few weeks ago
5,something the lord made review,this was a great movie that made a excellant christmas gift for my wife she enjoyed it. both the price and shipping was incrediable also.the movie arrived before christmas thank you again.
5,One Of My Favorite Moveis!,"I ordered this movie on Netflix and wanted to see it again. My husband said why not just order the DVD and Amazon is always my first stop for everything. I was so excited Amazon had this movie because this movie is at the top of my favorite movie list.Shows us how far we've come and how far we've yet to go in this country. But I'm so grateful for people who persevered through this horrible era in this country. It cannot be ignored and we can't wish it away. It is a part of American History although the history books do not show this side, it's a harsh reality of who this country really is.To all the men and women who've made historical contributions to this country, black and white. We salute you all!! It's simply a very sad thing that most Black contributions are often swept under the rug and ignored............this movies sheds light on one of those contributions! And I am so proud!"
3,Not so useful as a belt accessory,"The clear plastic bobble on the back side of the case, intended to connect the case to the belt clip, became loose after only one day of use. Other than that, the case is what I expected. I now use it without the belt clip, however."
3,works,the cover works well due to some clerical error i was sent the wrong case and i told then and they responded quickly and i had a new case in a short time after.
3,"Tough as nails, but causes scratches","I had one of this type of cover. Not rubberized, so that may fix the problem I had. Dropped it many times and no damage to the phone. However Once I took it off after many months, all the dust that got in between the phone and case acted like sandpaper, and destroyed the finish on the phone. Little pits everywhere, except where the case wasnt."
4,As expected,The product is as expected. But be careful while snapping on the case it is a little hard to snap on and off.
2,enV VX-9000 case cover with belt clip,The front cover blocks the use of most of the keys. I had to use an exacto knife to cut it out to be able to use the front keyboard. The belt clip broke off within days. Otherwise the fit is good and it protects the phone from drops now that it falls out of my pocket every time I bend over.
4,lg env case,rubberized case is great and protective. use with belt clip inside a pocket as the weight of the phone separates from the bottom half and phone is on the ground and the other half is still attached to pocket. or don't use the belt clip.
3,OK I guess --- but hardly one for the ages,"A nice touch, I suppose --- the only surviving original Wailer singing a variety of Marley's pre- and post-1973 hits --- but this album seems largely uninspired and smacks more of the desire to make a quick buck than anything else. Bunny acquits himself decently but seems mostly to be going through the motions here. I suspect that the world of Reggae, running thinner & thinner on original ideas, turned once again to the well of Bob Marley, hoping to generate some more interest from the mainstream. It didn't work. The result is an album which isn't terrible, but nonetheless remains quite average & forgettable. If you never were to hear it, you wouldn't be missing anything."
1,OPERATING SYSTEMS: INTERNALS AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES 3RD ED.,"This is the driest book I have ever read. Contrary to what some reviews state, this is NOT a book for beginners. It is very wordy and hard to understand. This book assumes an advanced level of knowledge (computer science) and written as such. It is not an introductory book and is very comprehensive. At times, information is presented in an obscure manner. If you are the type of person that needs to have something explained in a cut and dry manner and do not like deduce the answers yourself, you will not follow this book. Save this one for the Computer Science majors."
1,The most horrible book on networks I have ever read.,"This book is completely and utterly useless. If you want a good book on networks get Tanenbaum. If you like O'Reilly titles - concise and to the point, this book is a complete OPPOSITE. Wordy, and most of the time pointless! Even if you have to get this book for a course, don't!"
1,Pass on this one!,This book is wordy and confusing. The questions at the end of each chapter could only be answered if you have experience with operaing systems and computers. This is not a beginners book. It is probably a fine graduate level book or a an adv. operating systems book in undergraduate. BUT NOT A FIRST COURSE IN OPERATING SYSTEMS.
4,A Good Value,"This LCD for the money has the best picture to be found. Quite a few of the reviews I read previously made note of the inability to hook up external speakers and they are correct. This short coming is not a problem for regular TV but on DVDs I have found the sound to be a problem so I have added a home theater system. While this flaw points out that the Norcent 3215 is not perfect, it is still a very good value for the money."
3,'Tis a fine bag indeed.,"fine bag. holds my Olympus D-460(and manual), 4 extra smart cards, 8 AA batteries, my kodak photolife k1000 AA battery charging kit, various cables, and FlashPath 3.5' floppy adaptor with ease."
4,Perfect for Sony Mavica FD75,"I find this is perfect for carrying my Sony Mavica FD75, the batter charger and a few disks. There not much room for anything else, but then what's in it doesn't flop around - which is something I really like. The quality is good, I think this bag will last a long time. For the price, you can't beat it."
2,Case Camera Bag,"This bag has lots of pockets for batteries, cords, and memory cards, and plenty of room for my Olympus C-4000 camera. Unfortunately, within 3 months of purchasing it, the attached handle began to tear, and I can only use the included longer strap."
5,Great camera bag,"Well made, great camera bag for the price. Plenty of storage for batteries, charger and extra media smart cards. Excellent value for the money."
4,The logical case,"I purchased my bag for its size and price. Was not the least disappointed. Didn't want a large one, and this one is just right. I pack in (firm fit) my Sony 707 along with Sony flash all in the main compartment. Sure it is a ""shoehorn fit"" but nothing rattles /moves around. All the other stuff go into the other 3 compartments. Super contented with this one."
1,This bag is way too big,I bought and returned this bag. It is huge. I could have fit three digital cameras in there. The reason I bought the digital camera (olympus 3020) is that it is small and compact. This bag is almost as big as my camera bag for my SLR. My bag was also missing the divider so the camera would just flop around in the bag.
1,too big for Olympus 4040,"just purchased the Olympus 4040 and this case, The camera fills about 20% of the area set aside for the camera. The camera is just too small and bounces around with no protection! Not a good choice."
4,Good Bag !,"The Case Logic DC70 Digital Camera and Accessory Bag is great for Olympus C-3000, C-3040, C-3030 and the HP c315 xi and a couple of other HP and Olympus models. However it is not big enough to room the Sony Mavicas. So dont bother getting this for those.I do have a problem with this bag and that is that it seems like the accessories on there are really stuffed onces your camera is placed inside it. Because the camera comes with the USB Cable and the tv connection cable and it's hard to pack all of them in here with the camera without stuffing them in.....There's place for a battery recharger in there and a set of batteries along with the Compact flash cards. Overall this case is pretty decent although you've got to be careful not to let the case swing about from your arm and hit a wall or something. There are other websites selling this a little cheaper."
2,Case LogicDC70 - Not what the description told me,The bag I received does not fit the description listed here on the site. The bag is much larger and has no divider to keep the camera safely inside it. It is so large I could fit about four of my Olympus Camedia 520's in it. Even the hangtag on the bag describes things that are not in it. I had a great deal of trouble finding how to contact Amazon about this problem and am now awaiting and ARS container to return it for a refund. From reading other reviews I see I was not the only one to receive a bag much different from the one described here on the site. I will be buying a replacement from a store where I can actually see what I am getting.
1,2 Case Logic DC70 Cases,"The top loading Case Logic DC70 is SUPER!! The one selling at ..., is a front loading case. Not good for large cameras. Company makes 2 models using the same item number of DC70. Worth looking for the one that the camera goes in from the top of the case."
3,collars are worthless,"I agree with the other reviewer. The collars are junk. Only one of mine was cracked and didn't tighten right, but even the working ones are just a pain to use, and I wouldn't trust 'em. The other components, however you cant really screw up on, and are not bad for the price. I just ordered the Valeo Standard spring collars and they fit and work slick, so I think if you order these, just plan on ordering different collars at the same time. It's still not a bad deal, salvageable anyway."
2,I was not impressed,"This film has some impressive production values, but the storyline is pretty lame. The idea that a weather girl could flip up her skirt on air and that would somehow make her famous nationwide is just silly. There's a brief moment of eroticism in the film after a powerful female producer assigns a girl to become the weather girl's personal slave, and the girl is consequently shown bathing her new mistress, even licking soap off of her legs! But that one scene was hardly enough to save this otherwise silly, pointless video."
1,Strange Japanese movie,I watched it twice and I am still trying to figure it out.Maybe there is a book that can explain this movie...
3,Oh Kei!!!,Like all Japanese softporn movies Weather Woman is interesting from the standpoint of allowing us to exam a foreign culture and I'm sure there are many culturally pertinent things in the movie we Americans will never understand but that's what makes it such a trip. On the negative side is that typical childlike silliness that seems to invade these kind of movies and it becomes a bit repulsive. But we don't mind do we? After all if Andy Warhol had made a movie of Kei Mizutani standing nude next to the Empire State Building for twentyfour hours we would still buy it wouldn't we?
4,pretty good if you liek the weird,"it's weird, suprising, and sure to please anyone into odd japanese movies."
1,No Legal Right,"America has no obligation to pay reparations to the offspring of American slaves. Why is this still an issue today? When do we get past this issue? Most of the harm that happens to blacks and others come from themselves. Slavery was a horrible thing, but our nation has come way past that now. Time to change and be Americans."
1,Grow Up!,"The issue of reparations for slavery is not a black and white issue as Mr. Raymond Winbush (PhD in psychology, not history) would contend. Slavery was multiracial and international. The United States represented only a small percentage of the total Trans-Atlantic slave population."
3,No Debate Needed,"No matter the argument, no matter the highly intellectualized words, no matter the mantra of a ""A wrong done"" A people harmed! and money is due: the idea of financial payment for slavery is abhorent. Remember that Black Americans pay taxes as well so they, are in reality, paying themselves. But money is not the main issue here, there are those, both Black and White, who want to either wallow in perpetual anger or in perpetual guilt. If we wish to study the practice of slavery we should first begin with the Africans themselves.."
2,We're All Paying Now,"America is already paying for Reparations in the forms of Social Welfare, Black Crime, Special Classes and Affirmative Action. This is not to say that American Blacks should be isolated from the mainstream of American society; American Blacks should have had their rightfull place in American society a long time ago. But Reparations are an insiduous form of Guilt by association, an attempt by a small minority to feed forever on the cash cow of White guilt. But why now? as Black Americans are beginning to reap the benefits of America. I think there are some Black Americans who miss the old days of racism, those days where they could talk (and brag) about ""what the ""White Man"" done to them."" Now, realizing that most whites arn't racist, these people are emotionally lost, who can they blame for their own failures?. If Reparations are ever approved only Afro-Americans will pay; not with their lives but with an increase of racism much more subtle of those long ago days."
5,beautifully written,"From the mathematical point of view, this is an enjoyable read; it could even serve as a first exposure to algebraic topology.It is without question that Penrose's remarkable insights have come a long way in helping physicists foster new mathematical ideas, and put them on solid footing; and this is what the authors have set out to do. It is written in a very clear and lucid style, and it is the most comprehensive expository work in mathematical physics that I have seen in a long time.-A"
5,A model of clarity,This is an extremely well written book. Couldn't be more clear. The authors derserve an AMS award for clarity of exposition. They even explain to physicists (read mathematical idiots) what a sheaf cohomolgy is. Hats raised to their efforts.
4,not so easy ...,"I'm another one of the ""total idiots"" physicists. Unfortunately, I wasn't so lucky with the book. While I find here and there a few pages that I can understand without too much stress, there are other parts that caused me to abort reading - symbol stack overflow. Why do I get the impression that others here may rate this as a five star book simply to express their (probably well deserved) pride to have understood some of it? It's more than just a little difficult to read this book. They call this an introduction?"
2,Yuck.,"I was trying to experiment with alternatives to Feline Pine so I decided to give this a try. First, the smell of the pellets themselves is terrible... reminded me of old Pizza Hut... and not in a good way. Second, it doesn't absorb odors NEARLY as well as Feline Pine, which masks it (for my three cats) for several days... this didn't even last several hours. Plus, the tracking was TERRIBLE in comparison. If you want a pine litter, stick to Feline Pine... this isn't worth the money at all."
2,Tried it,"Well, we had one of those litter systems that you put the chips in the top and the pee comes down into the pee pad. I tried these pellets instead since I didn't like how dirty the reusable pellets were. I think this is good if you are trying to be organic. The pee turns these pellets into sawdust. The poop just waits for you. I have to use something more powerful to still love my cats."
1,Not impressed.,I was not happy with this litter.It's messy and doesn't last as long - moving on to the next one.
4,interesting,we paired this with the SCD diet and use it as general knowledge or for specific recipes. good one for sure
1,Kindle owners! Do not download this book!,"Regardless of the content. I must point out if you download this book on your Kindle, you will not be able to read the illustrations and none of all the ""figures""( and there are a lot of them). You can not change the font size.Nor can you darken the print, for it is light gray. Secondly, many of the ""in the box"" text are incomplete.So do not buy this book for your Kindle."
3,"Good dietary advice, but too one-dimensional...","There is some solid dietary advice in this book for those looking to make some positive changes from mainstream dietary habits, but it's too one-dimensional to be used as the basis for an overarching nutritional program. I say this partly because there are many factors that enter into an informed nutrition plan beyond an inflammation score. Also, the listing of foods and their inflammation scores is very limited.This is a good book as a Level 1 source of information for those looking to make dietary adjustments, but if you've already successfully implemented standard healthful dietary changes, this isn't a book that would be very helpful in helping you finetune those further."
4,great to start learning with,"This book was the first one I read, great information , easy to read. Great for the beginner in learning what causes inflammation in the body. Would recommend to friends that wanted to learn about their diet."
1,Terrible advice - good idea,The book has a point behind it that we should be eating less inflammatory foods but here is a list of foods it says in inflammatory:Pomegranates and its juicePrunesOld Fashioned Oatmeal (not the instant stuff)Pumpkin SeedsSunflower SeedsYogurt with live cultures (studies show this is actually anti-inflammatory)GrapesThis is a just to name a few... I'd like to know how she came up with this.... pulling numbers out of a hat?
4,Inflammation and Diet,"This book is well-written, though not in an authoritative, academic style, with references.I am motivated to follow the recommendations of the author, by observing her diet constraints.After several months, I will see if it works for me. At that time, my opinion would be more definitive.AA"
4,The Inflammation-Free Diet Plan,"This book is immensely helpful to those interested in lowering inflammation levels. The food index as well as the supplement suggestions are, in my opinion, the most valuable parts of the book.The recipes are fine but the rest of the book was ""dumbed down"" to the point that it left me with too many questions and a desire to read material about the subject that was written by a medical professional."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"I'm excited to find this information on how to reduce inflammation in the body, but disappointed to find several discrepancies, or if they're not discrepancies then the information needs to be explained; as with cherries. In the book they are rated as inflammatory, when in reality cherries and especially cherry extract can cure gout and treat arthritis inflammation. And there are several ratings that don't concur with the website ratings. Also I think she misses the boat when she outlines meals that can come out with a minus score, having the day end with a plus score. This causes spikes in inflammation attacks throughout the day. Why not have each meal end with a plus score?"
2,not bad,"So far I'm a little disappointed with the product. Ink flows great, and I'm not having a problem with it getting dirty or anything. But the ink hitting the bristol bleeds a little. I'm not getting the sharp sharp line I'd hoped for. I'm still working with it, perhaps a different paper or ink, or just really moving the pen quicker. Again it's a pretty cool pen set, just not quite as good as I'd hoped so far."
2,Leaks!,"I got this thinking that it work well to hold my hot tea in my bag when I am on my Vespa, but it leaks through the lid. The topmost colored part unscrews from the plastic part and leaks like crazy. It also creates a tight seal which suctions the tea right out and into my bag. I would not recommend this for anyone not using it in an upright cup holder."
3,Fits on a 2004 Sportsman but....,"I bought this with the Superwinch lt2000. It fits well, but really sticks out in front of the unit. The mount plate is so long that the winch is just about completely exposed, about 10 inches in front of the atv. Calling them now to see if they offer a shorter one.Easy installation though, just way too long. If they could cut 8 inches off the plate and move the bolt holes back, it would be perfect.2004 Polaris Sportsman 400Alex..."
3,Did not like it,The price was good but the problem I had was that I have celiac and even though the oats said gluten free they made just as sick as if they had gluten in them. My doctor told me that there is no such thing as gluten free oats and that the oats in the fiber does have gluten in it.
1,ORGANIC TRIPLE FIBER,Not a good product clogs you up unless you drink over 10 glasses of water Found real help with Oxy- Powder it works !!!
4,triple fiber,"it was ok the first couple of days, it did what it set out to do then afta i started gettin diareah so i stopped."
4,Worth It!,"My first portable MP3 and I am not disappointed. Positives: sounds great, small, lightweight, reasonably well-made, built-in memory, fast downloads, docking station with rechargeable batteries. Negatives: FM radio weak (does not compare to Sony FM Sports Walkman). Docking station quirky - lacks the reassuring 'click' a la Palm Pilot. Creative software awful - grab MS Windows Media Player instead (but to use it, you'll need the firmware update available on Creative's web page). Plan on replacing the headphones (unless you like being uncomfortable). And in general, requires careful handling (cannot take abuse like a sports walkman... forget about taking it out in the rain). In-line remote would have been nice. Arm or belt clip even nicer. But trust me, if you like to exercise to music you'll never go back!"
4,The Porsche of MP3 Players,"Okay.. well.. after demoing a lot of mp3 players, I bought this player. I have a Rio 500 as well. Between the two: The Nomad II MG has FAR louder sound than the rio. The docking station is just annoying compared to the simple cable of the rio (I think you can buy a cable for the Nomad though) The timescaling function is useless (Nomad II MG) Nomad II is not much smaller, but feels smaller.Software on the PC: Rio Audio Manager is lame, but not as bad as the default creative software. It is clunky to use. I will just use the winamp plugin I think.Also, the RIO does copy files slightly faster, but not much."
5,Big Bang for the Buck,"After an exhausting search of the MP3 market I decided to go for the Nomad IIMG and I'm glad I did. The user interface is excellent and the sound quality is superb. If you look at the other packages on the market you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal for the money. The cradle has a dual function, recharging the player and connecting your pc via USB port for file transfer. With the flash memory on the unit upgrades to futures are a snap."
5,My favorite Culture album,"I've always loved the Sonia Pottinger produced Culture albums, this one in particular. There's no filler material here, but Innocent Blood, Poor Jah People, Natty Never Get Weary and Down In Jamaica stand out for me. A lot of Jamaican history is told in this album, and history has never sounded sweeter. You might be moved to shed a tear or two if you listen to this while intoxicated, it's that powerful."
5,Very Nice Camera Bag,"I recently purchased this camera bag for my Canon G9 and all its accessories. I really like it! When I was looking for a bigger camera bag, I asked around. People suggested either Lowepro or Tamrac camera bags. I looked at those brands and none of the bags fit my needs. This bag met my needs. I am hooked on Mountainsmith camera bags!"
3,a HEAVY bag..,"well made, but sort of looks like a lunch box or padded cooler. The rubber bottom really adds a lot of extra weight...kept it, but bought something lighter to carry around."
5,"Gracias, Señora Scruggs","As an elementary Spanish teacher at a small independent school, I found the book a delight. I am already incorporating some of the songs into my curriculum. I look forward to integrating more of the songs with our music and Bible programs, as many of the songs are perfect for chapel.I really enjoyed how Kathy Scruggs personalized the project by describing her experiences alongside the history or tradition of many of the songs."
4,Wrong Dimensions,"This product is listed with wrong dimensions in all amazon stores, the listed Product Dimensions: 25 x 10.2 x 18 inches ; 18.9 pounds is mistaken, the REAL DIMENSIONS are: 21.1/2 x 14 x 8 in; 14.3 lb.But if it could fit my telescope I would be very satisfied with the product. Unfotunely I have to return it."
1,the end of BOA,"as a huge BOA fan back in the day, i remember being so disappointed when this came out. it was literally the end of the line for the band. rickie lee had left the band, and soon after this was released, BOA split up entirely and later jim and jimmy formed a new version and recorded 2 bad albums for capricorn. stick with their first cd all the way through x rated."
2,Disappointing,A nice introduction to rangefinders for those who have no idea about them but it's not more than that. I was hoping for more information but there was none. Very disappointing.
5,I love these shoes!!,"I know these are suppose to be for men but, I have a wide foot and the new style ladies loafers just don't look right on me. I always loved my penny loafers from when I was in high school so I decided to get these since they look like the same style. They are now my new favorite shoe!!!"
5,THE BEST,"This food processor can do anything (except actually make the meal). It is also very quiet to use and a breeze to clean up. Careful with the blades, they are very sharp!"
2,Arrived broken!,"Sadly, I have learned to be skeptical of breakable electronic appliances arriving without being damaged in shipping. This item was only packed with some crumpled brown paper but looked okay when I opened and unpacked it all. I was ready to make a smoothie this morning for my kids but when I added the fruit and milk, I realized it wouldn't turn on when plugged in. I think the motor was damaged by too much banging in shipping. I will go back to purchasing my household electronic kitchen items from Bed, Bath and Beyond."
1,Does not come with stem!,"I received this only to realize that the detachable stem needed for the shredding and grating discs is not included. So basically those two blades are useless until I spend more money. The instruction DVD casually tells you to attach the stem to the discs, acting as if you should have it with you as part off your new purchase. My processor also came without the instruction manual. I'm not sure if Cuisinart or Amazon is to blame for this, but I'm deeply dissatisfied with my purchase and will likely return it."
2,Awkard design requires food pusher always be engaged,"This lovely strong machine is driving me nuts. I kept looking for the off/on switch that would allow me to add stuff while operating the maching. No way...safety first has killed a great product. The only way to use this is with the food pusher all the way in any time you turn it on. I did find that an ice pick will also engage the switch and overide this feature. Perhaps this should be standard with the purchase. Otherwise, it is a lovely tool."
1,HIDEOUS! Best ad possible for Kitchen Aid!,"This thing STINKS! It takes forever to get the %^^^%$ thing to work. Unlike normal food processors, it is not a simple matter of clicking everything in place ... everything has to be aligned ""just so"" (and, if not, the machine freezes for five minutes before you can even try again) - but neither the booklet, box, nor DVD acknowledge this, and swiftly skim over assembly. Yuck! Buy a Kitchen Aid and forget about this huge, expensive doorstop.Cuisinart food processors used to be awesome, and I never even considered trying another brand until I bought this atrocity. I would NEVER buy Cuisinart again!"
1,Disaster,"I was sent an appliance with an electrical plug and voltage (in this case fixed at 120v) that were incompatible with New Zealand specifications (230-240v). Nothing to indicate the potential problem was apparent from the product description on the website. Considerable expense would have been needed to purchase a transformer to make it work safely and the cost in terms of preparing and posting the return package has been most frustrating, made all the more so because the food processor itself seemed ideal for our purposes. Back to square one!"
1,"oooops, not so great","Replaced my trusty and cheap ($39) Hamilton Beach food processor with this. Expected splendid quality. Oh, HAHA. The safety feature is a show stopper (yes, I need to use the feed tube with the processor running). Sometimes it was near impossible to get the top on, or the large tube back into the top. Then the stinker broke, sort of, the safety feature no longer worked, and I couldn't get the work bowl off the base. We won't even mention how very large and HEAVY the base is. Nor mention that it only has one speed, which is too slow to really mince stuff well without grinding it to powder. So, my husband finally figured out what was wrong. The $46 work bowl part of the safety feature was broken. So, for slightly more than the price of a new Hamilton Beach unit, I can replace the work bowl. Hooray for Cuisinart. Sucked me in with their myth about quality."
5,I love this thing!,"I cook a lot, and waited far too long to buy a food processor. This Cuisinart is easy to set up and take down, easy to clean, and makes short work of so many prep tasks. Well worth the money."
4,A good food processor,I have used this product primarily for dough making and it works super good for that.I can make dough within a minute. I have made plain dough as well as mixed that with various thins.I would have given 5 stars to this product but the only problem I have faced is cleaning the blade. The blade is super sharp and I have cut my fingers every time while cleaning the blade. There should be a blade handle or something that we can hold the blade with while cleaning.
2,so disappointed,"I had become so excited waiting for my processor to arrive. It finally arrived and I set it all up. I made one recipe with it and it was so easy.The next morning, I went to use it again and it would not start. I took it all apart,obviously not the motor and reassembled it and still no luck.The best part of all was how easy and quick the return was.My package was picked up so soon and my refund was also so satisfactory."
5,Great!,"I am so happy to have this full-sized food processor. I wonder how I managed so long without it! I have used it for pastry dough, soups, all kinds of things. I haven't used the slicing blades yet, but that's not really why I bought it. I can't think of any way this product could be improved upon."
1,Frustrated,"I have a lot of Cuisinarts because I use them to make cosmetic products. However, I can't even get this baby to turn on at all. Safety pusher engaged or whatever. And wouldn't you know it, I've misplaced the instructions and can't get them online at Cuisinart.com. When you click download instructions a 2 page document comes up in Acrobat. Please just help me get it to turn on. My other Cuisinarts are no problem and they require the safety pusher be engaged too. Any ideas? velvetneedles@hawaii.rr.com"
5,Love my 14 cup Cuisinart!!,"Just purchased my first food processor last month. LOVE IT, I've used it for bread, brownies, cookies, meatballs, chopping and slicing carrots, strawberries, potatos, cucumbers, bread for breadcrumbs, & onions. Even made my frosting in it. Been married 15 years this month and wish I would've gotten one 15 years ago. Easy to clean, safe, I even dirty less dishes which is a good thing since I don't have a dishwasher either. Buy one, you won't be sorry. Just be sure to leave it on your counter and use it, even for the simple things, cleanup is a snap."
1,Overkill on the safety features,"I received the stainless steel version of this processor as a gift. I have only had it for 2 weeks and I am already discouraged with it. I seems to work fine, however, because of the ""safety features"" I find it awkward and inefficient. The large sleeve is designed so that you must disengage the lock each time you want to add more food. I can imagine that it will break in a short time if you use it often and this lock is necessary to start the machine. Also, you cannot put any food in the processor that is taller than the pusher because the pusher cannot be removed from the sleeve. If these things don't bother you, you will enjoy it. I haven't had a food processor for about 10 years. My old one had a removeable pusher and was much more convenient than this model."
1,Get ready to replace $70 of parts every year,"First - Cuisinart has the worst customer support I've encountered lately. If you should need parts for this, and try to order them, you will encounter a slow-as-molassas and confusing website with incorrect photographs and descriptions, persistant backorders, long hold times, and telephone representatives who really don't give a darn.I am not basing this on a single call I was unsatisfied with, rather a series of them, all with different representatives.Our unit is used lightly (1-2 times per week to chop potatoes, onions, and the like, but the plastic (lexan?) portions are incredibly fragile. We are not the only ones - the plastic pusher for the item above is backordered SEVEN weeks.The Kitchen Aid Pro Line is better."
1,2 year life span,"I share the same disappointment as other reviewers. I ran this unit once a week for 2 years and then it stopped working. The beefy looking hardware is not so durable. Unfortunately this product suffers from the same ""China syndrome"" that so many products seem to be afflicted with these days."
1,Bowl made of BPA,"Good processor but bowl is made of BPA (a component of Lexan). Boo. Just spoke with their customer service, they said there is no plan to manufacture BPA-free replacement bowls. Double boo. Very unhappy since I use/d this almost on a daily basis, also to make baby food."
2,Over zealous safety,"I agree with all the criticism of those folks who rated the product 2 or less stars. Power, yes, but the manufacturer has gone overboard on the safety bit just as other folks have described. Of course, that may be due to our over lawyer-ed litigious society! I have had my machine for about a year, use about once a week, and find the construction awkward too. Fortunately, no cracks yet but I am sure they will eventually show up. I have another criticism, the machine leaks terribly. I like to make soups, gazpacho etc. There is always a lot of liquid left behind on the bench when the bowl is removed. Furthermore, when you try to pour out the liquid, the cutter falls out unless you are sure to retain it. Hint: I fixed that problem by wrapping some teflon pipe tape around the shaft. Add that to overseas customer service, an oxymoron, and I am sorry I spent the bucks."
3,Love cooking,Really love the job it does but the plastic piece is junky! Cracked at second use:( very disappointed! But I do still use it
3,Good but not great,I like this product because it has a better locking system than my older cheaper food processor. It has sturdy construction and a nice look on your counter. It comes with a good assortment of attachments. The downfall for this processor is that it can your turn vegetable to mush when chopping or slicing for your recipe. I haven't used it for much else yet so it may be just what you want.
2,Liquids always escape the processor bowl!,"I have used this processor for several months now. I am really disappointed because every time I use it to create a large batch of something that contains liquids, the liquid always flows out *somewhere* and ends up underneath the processor bowl. What's the point of a large bowl if it won't contain the food? There is a marking on the bowl for liquid level, and even when I don't go over that mark, the liquids still flow out. It seems that eventually the liquid will seep under the central post and into the electronics and there goes an expensive food processor. I would not buy this model again."
5,Great product!,"Quiet to operate. Unlike most food processors, you can have a conversation while using it. Really satisfied With the choice"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I've had my Cuisinart food processor almost 2 years. A few weeks ago, the center spindle just froze. The motor continued to hum, but the spindle didn't move. I called Cuisinart, hoping to find a local repair shop that could fix it. NOPE!!! You have to ship it back to Cuisinart, with no quaranty that anything can be done. So, my expensive state-of-the-art food processor sits - not working. I was VERY disappointed with Cuisinart. I had heard horror stories of their lack of customer service, but really didn't believe them. Well, I DO NOW!!! So I am now finished with Cuisinart."
1,not worth it,"We had this for less than 2 years and finally took it out for some baking, and it doesn't even turn on anymore. All the parts are made in China, what do you expect? Not a high quality tool."
4,It does the job!,"I have been trying to find a food processor that I liked and that worked, as well. It is very quiet and I love the look. There are two reasons I have only given it 4 stars. I have only had it about a week and the sheer weight of it. It is a snap to clean and it stores with no issues. I did have to clear out some space in the lower cabinet (weight and all). I am vegan and constantly making sauces out of soaked cashews. This food processor has been the only that has completely obliterated all minuscule bits of the cashews. You may laugh, but you should try it. It's a pain. The 4 stars may turn into 5. Stay tuned."
5,What a time saver,"This powerful Cuisinart 14 cup food processor allows our family to choose more interesting, healthier, and more nutritious meals. This powerful machine makes short and easy work out of chopping and mixing.Like many machines, there is a learning curve. The user has to accommodate its limitations. For instance, as other reviewers have mentioned. liquids can be a problem since the lid does not seal tightly. With careful sequencing of ingredients or judicious pulsing, it will work fine.This is a great machine especially for big jobs."
4,Excellent Product,"My husband loves homeade salsa and I make it every two weeks. I needed a bigger food processor to make it easier and less of a mess to make. I've got a smaller Cuisinart that works well - my biggest complaint was leakage if you used much liquid.I debated the brand for a long time, read all the reviews etc. and finally decided on the Cuisinart. Having had the brand before, I didn't have the problem I read about with the locking mechanism as the small one works the same. This larger one works great (though you can still get too much liquid, but it's much harder than with the small one) and I'm very happy with it.The other reviews are correct in that it weighs a ton. I keep the small food processor in the pantry, but this one has to stay on the counter because it's too heavy to move on and off. Fairly small price to pay for a good machine."
5,Amazing,This will devour anything you put in it. Works great and is easy to clean and set up. I would also recommend getting the storage accessory for the blades as they are extremely sharp.
4,Sensitive mic with a long cord,"The microphone stand can only be adjusted in one plane, but otherwise this product is excellent in design and sound quality. The cord is conveniently long."
2,"Okay, but has flaws, lots","I bought this microphone thinking that it would be good for many applications. When i got home, i plugged it in and it was a huge disapointment. I had bought it for voice recognition. I had read good reviews on it and thats why i bought it in the first place. When i tried it with my voice recognition software, it only had 40 percent comphrehension. It said it wasn't compatible. then other voice recognition software had hardly any comprehension at all, i tried using it to do commands on my PC. The only thing this was good for was when i used it in sound recorder. To those who want to buy this, i suggest that you dont. What good is a mic that is only good for one application?"
1,Masochists need only apply,Do you enjoy throwing out 1/5 of your blank CDs? How about crashing after every other successfully burnt CD? Then this drive is for YOU!
1,Dont Buy,I bought this product and all it led to were problems. The software that sony provides is problematic in particular when you try to install it through a DVD drive. To make things worse it is very difficult to remove this software once it is installed. The standard uninstall was not sufficient for me and I was forced to reformat my hard drive twice.
1,Haven't received it yet.,"I haven't received this product yet, but when I do I will let you know when I do get it."
4,JET DC-1100 DUST COLLECTION SYSTEM.,THE UNIT IS VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED. IT OFFERS ITSELF FOR MULTIPURPOSE USUAGE. IT IS VERY LIGHT WEIGHT ALLOWING ITSELF TO BE EASILY MOVED OR CONNECTED. AT THIS POINT I DO NOT HAVE POSSESS AN EXTENSIVE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE USING IT. I HAVE RUN THE UNIT WITH A TEN INCH DELTA CONTRACTOR'S SAW WITHOUT DIFFICULTY. A MAJOR CONCERN WITH UNITS OF THIS TYPE ARE AMPERAGE PROBLEMS TRIPPING BREAKERS. THIS UNIT IS RUN ON THE SAME 20- AMP CIRCUIT AS THE SAW AND DOESN'T APPEAR TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF IT.OVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND THE UNIT FOR GENERAL ALL PURPOSE SHOP USE. IT WOULD BE NICE IF JET WOULD INCLUDE THE MICRO BAG SET. THIS ISN'T EXACTLY A LOW END UNIT.
4,A Great Dust Collector,"This is a good collector, it collects all my jointer/planer shavings and a lot the dust from my table saw. I have trouble with the metal band that secures the top bag - some times there are loose areas and it spews out fine dust. Overall a great tool, and I back it up with a JDS Air-Tech air filter."
3,Quiet? Not Mine.,"I don't think this tool can be described as ""Quiet"". Yes. It has less noise than my ear piercing Ridgid shop vaccume, but I wouldn't call it quiet. I am not sure how can you do a normal conversation with this machine on. I have two other problems. The top bag has dusk leaking at the sealing and lower bag is very difficult to remove.Am I just unlucky?"
5,It's what I expected plus...,"......As far as the Dust Collector is concerned, it assembles easily in about 45 minutes. I've never worked with one before, but it is so much more quiet than the shop vac. That alone makes it desirable. I will need to do much work to mount ductwork, blast gates and connector hoses before I can fully evaluate it. Just sticking the hose in the wake of the radial saw discharge makes a measurable difference. The fit and finish are great. No hassles with the assembly and it looks good in the shop. Good first experience with Jet and I would recommend Amazon to anyone."
2,AMAZON.COM your just a bit off with the 40% off crap,"this unit is a little above bottom of the line in the 1 1/2 dc category, there are numerous better dust collectors at this price range. the jet is noisy and loses a lot of compression if used in a static system...."
2,Disappointing in lack of information,"While any accurate photos and information on Skara Brae are a gift to the world, this book is a disappointment. It appears more as a quick way to make a buck than an homage to a marvel of pre-history.My impression, however accurate or not, is that the author skimmed what travel brochures she could obtain at the site and reformatted the information for the pages of a hasty book.But seek out any windows, including this book if nothing else, to see the world of Skara Brae, where people didn't have wood and had to build with stone, leaving intact their great rooms, tables, bed-nooks, and even niches in the bed-area walls, (for personal effects?). I feel the centuries between us erode when I see pictures of their everyday structures, which are otherwise lost in houses build of wood.- Jane Yett"
3,Okay for us,"Our experience is that this falls short of the original cartridges for print quality. Uneven toner throughout... not because we did not follow directions.However, our needs have changed over the years and this is now okay for us.The price was right and we did not need to buy a new printer because ours was so old that toner cartridges were no longer available.I would buy another from them in the future."
5,35 Watt Par36 Halogen Bulbs,Great lighting products at great prices. Plus fast shipping. I will definitely continue to make my outdoor lighting purchases here!
2,Warning: there are two kinds of 30251 labels,"These labels have only two rolls of 130 labels in each box. You can find boxes with two rolls of 350 each if you look, and these are a much better value. This item suspiciously does not seem to include information about the number of labels."
4,A Good Product At A Fair Price,This is a fine product that I have been using for a few years.I use this for both personal and for business.This is one of the most useful pieces of hardware I have ever bought for my computer.It is both a time saver and does actually expedite my mailings because it puts the proper shipping bar codes on the labels.These labels are the best brand for my money and the seller delivered them when promised. I do recommend them and this product to others.Dean
5,needed for label writer,"These go with the Dymo Labelwriter my husband got me for my birthday. Yep, I'm that organized. But these are the address size and therefore the ones I use the most even though I don't only use them for addresses. The Labelwriter is a must for anyone who wants to be organized. We use it ALL the time and being able to print out the address labels quickly is so much nicer than handwriting them especially when paying bills."
3,Nice all in one combo but poor FM audio.,I was disappointed in the FM audio quality for the FM broadcast band. It sounded limited and mushy. Also it could not reliably pick up a distant station which I can now get on a boombox(I returned this unit). It's very well made and very easy to program and I would recommend it to anyone who only wants FM as an extra and doesn't plan on listening to FM a lot.
1,product not up to acceptable standard,clock loses time on a daily basis and the set frequencies drift.stataic almost impossible to clear.have returned product.dosen't seem to be up to Uniden standards
1,Outdated,"As the world slowly departs the 450 band, this is becoming a boat anchor. Since it doesn't have an aircraft band its becoming rather useless to me."
1,You get what you pay for...,"Not at all thrilled with this knife...doesn't cut like I thought it would, even after sharpening. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more for a better knife."
1,"I bought this to get Funky Poodle, most of the other songs suck","If you remember the song ""Funky Poodle"" which was an LA hit in the 80's, the only way you gan buy it, is to get this hodgepodge compilation. There are a couple other fun tracks...Funky Comidina and Bust a Move, but the other tracks are really bad. It appears the music supervisor for this film searched through Itunes garage bands, or maybe recorded these ""gems"" himself, just to make some quick cash. Do what I did. Buy the album and be ready to hit ""delete""!"
5,So real you'll want to trash your cell phone!,"If you like THE BRIDE WORE BLOOD, you will love DEATH ON A CELLULAR LEVEL. Hunnings writes a fast-paced, tightly woven tale that will keep you spellbound till the very last page. What I liked about this book is that she has more fully developed the characters. Cece is so real she could be your nextdoor neighbor. If you have a friend who's a mystery lover, buy him or her a copy for a special occasion. You'll score big points!Jo Williams"
5,Brilliant and engaging,"After having purchased almost all of Amazon's collection on sundials, I eagerly awaited this book's delivery. From the first page, I regretted not having bought it before as Sir Mark Lennox Boyd has produced a masterpiece. Anyone who has an appreciation for gnomonics should get this book. Although it contains technical information, it's the historical journey which is most engaging."
1,Get the Paperback,"My mother bought this for me for Christmas. She used the ""available new and used"" section to get it a little cheaper. She ended up paying $160 or so. When I put this on my wish list I thought that this hardcover version would be the Arabic-English/English-Arabic, considering that it was $175 and the paperback of the Arabic-English only was available for $45. As it turns out, this is only the hardcover of the Arabic-English only. So for one, my mother paid an additional $115 for only the hardcover version of a book that I could have gotten in the paperback for $45. I still do not have the English-Arabic of the Hans Wehr edition."
3,Not a Kaleidoscope but a Teleidoscope,"A kaleidoscope makes pretty pictures with the help of colored glass, dried flowers or other colorful bits which are ""fractured"" through a set of prisms. A teleidoscope has a magnifying lens which ""fractures"" the things you see through it and is most effective when your surroundings are colorful.Teleidoscopes can be a lot of fun, and possibly they are safer for smaller children because there are no small parts which can fall out.However, I wanted another kaleidoscope for my collection since I already owned enough teleidoscopes. It's like getting a pickup truck when you ordered a convertible. That is why I only gave it three stars.I. Alde"
1,Junk,"I was very diappointed with this product. It is very cheaply made. The tube is little more than reinforced papertowel-roll quality cardboard. Unlike other kaleidoscopes, the image does not change when the kaleidoscope is rotated and the image itself is very fuzzy, as if the lenses are clouded. The ""lenses"" appear to be no more than a half circle of plastic (guessing this is the ""marble"" they describe in the product title) on one end and thin bent platic on the other. This is promptly being returned! Its junk!"
4,Kids like them,"Unfortunately our dog liked them too. Chewed them to pieces. Just a vinyl covered cardboard tube with a plastic chrystal glued to one end, but they work and are fun for the children."
2,OK for short-term.,"I purchased my 3"" full-size memory foam mattress topper about 10 months ago. Initially, the memory pad provided the comfort and support I needed, but about two to three months ago, the pad developed a significant depression in the middle. Flipping it over didn't help. It has a large permanent sag in the middle, there are tears in the foam where the sag has formed, and the edges of the pad have begun to discolor.This product deteriorated very quickly. I do not recommend you purchase this, unless you can afford to replace it every 6 months."
4,good topper,this topper makes the bed so soft! i have it in my guest room and some really like it and others not as much. I slept on it for several years and it really improved my sleep.... especially since i put it on a really old mattress. the memory foam is somewhat temperature sensetive and it will get softer with heat and more firm when it's cold.
3,"Good Story, but a little long",The story has a great foundation to build upon but the book left me wondering why it had as many pages as it did.
4,Great little case for the money,"This case is ideal for the digital elph. The mere fact that you have purchased a very small camera is the same reason that you would want this very small case. Size matters!!! regarding the case, it protects the camera and has a handy little zippered compartment in which to carry your extra memory and battery. The only downside of this case is the velcro, used to hold the camera in the case, which in my situation of having used it extensively has come loose. There is really not much danger of the camera falling out at the moment, but eventually I will need a new case. Fortunately, they are inexpensive, and I will buy the same case again."
5,"Cute, Form-fitting, in one word: PERFECT","This thing is great! It fits the s100 perfectly. You can wear it on a belt like a ""holster"", which is perfect for guys because we don't have purses to throw a camera in. A few suggestions: don't carry both a memory card and a battery in the front pouch at the same time. It makes it too bulky. Also, when velcroing the camera in, push the front and back of the case together as far as possible before letting the velcro touch. In conclusion, a great buy for [for the money]!"
4,"Simple, soft, great","It's a simple little soft case that fits snuggly on the camera. The case has a belt loop on the back so you can slide your belt through and hold it safely at your side. The case also has a nice little pouch on the front for an extra battery and memory card, and if you REALLY cram it, you can even get the cable that connects to your computer inside that little pouch. I only wish there were an easy way to attach a should strap to the case for the days I don't have a belt."
1,Be careful if you buy this product.,"My mom and dad bought me the Elph 100 for x-mas with this case. The first day I put it in the case then on my belt the worst case happened, it dropped out of the case VELCRO is what fastens it to inside the case and cracked a plastic piece off the camera.Man was I upset. Didn't even get to take one picture. Luckly It still works. I am going to write Canon to get it replaced.Good Luck."
2,Velcro latch wears out,"I love the style of this case (with a pouch to carry extra battery pack and compact flash disc), however, the velcro latch on the side of the case lost it's ""sticking power"" after 2 months of use. While I don't believe the camera will fall out of the side that the latch covers, it is still worrysome that it does not hold tight."
2,there are better choices...,"This case is flimsy and poorly sealed; a velcro tag is all that keeps the camera from falling out or getting wet. Instead consider the LowePro D-Res 8S, it's better made, padded, and just a bit bulkier. The 8S is sized for the 200/220, whereas the 8 (no S) is bigger and made for the 330. You will want a case -- you would not want to leave the lcd screen exposed to scratches."
3,Decent but not fantastic,"This was a great little case - we used it until, well, it fell apart. The thickness and size were perfect - protected the camera without being too bulky. Unfortunately, the part that broke was the belt strap. After multiple times of sliding it on and off my belt, the piece of fabric the belt slid through wore away. It wasn't immediate, which is why I didn't give it 1 star, but a better material and stitching could have prevented this problem."
5,Just what I needed,"I was first introduced to this product in a store where I bought some walking shoes. I requested something that would prevent blisters when I walked. I have a LOT of foot problems and I am very prone to getting blisters if I walk for any length of time. I purchased the socks and they worked like a dream. I now purchase them through Amazon.com because it is easier and more convenient.I absolutely love these socks. They are so comfortable and they do protect my feet from blisters. Now, walking as far as I want is no longer a problem. I would highly recommend them."
4,Its pretty cool.,"Its kinda hard to keep up with. I was kinda dissapionted to find it doesn't have ""Reflection"" on it but the songs are awesome!"
3,Good for first time,"It is the size of a small hotwheel. the instructions were not clear about the paint and primer as this was my childs first car model at age 7 and he thought the white was a color option (as it that was connected to the other colors and was not identified) and so chose to have his car white...later in the instructions we figured out that it was actually the varnish to put on for later....ALSO WHEELS WILL NOT STAY ON and STICKERS HAVING TROUBLE. so he cannot really play with it, he keeps losing wheels."
4,pretty good buy!,"I am a student and was looking for an affordable, functional camera bag for a digital SLR. I decided to go for this due to its size/price ratio - and am quite happy with the buy! The bag is not as dull as it looks in the picture, is well made, has ample padding , and has adjustable partitions inside (which was not mentioned in the description). Needless to say, the camera fits easily with enough room for accessories like flash, charger, 2 more lenses."
5,Comparable to Salinger,One of the best short story collections I have read. Comparable in many ways to Salinger.
3,"Good organizer, good screen, good size, but poor PC-Link","This yo-180 is quite good, the screen is a 5*18 lines, the keyboard is smooth and responsive... For that price, it's a good deal. I'm happy with it...Except one thing, Sharp announces a PC-Link. In fact this is just a backup utility with no possibilities to update or upload massives data from your PC (one by one only).They need to improve this Pc-Link software..."
4,YO-180 New Electronic Organizer Does a Good Job,"This is a great Electronic Organizer. Size just right for coat or shirt pocket. Good memory size for most users. Very Light in weight. Has good size fonts easy to read. The note function is great, pleanty of lines to put a lot of information. Only down side is software that comes with product is sub-standard can only backup data. Can not update calendar or lookup phone numbers on your PC from information downloaded from this unit to your PC. Upside this is a new product and hopefully software is in the wings."
3,"Looks good, packable, wish it were made of something else.","I can fit two full bodied cameras, super wide lens and a 100-400 zoom with lenses attached to bodies.There is still room for filters, batteries and other misc.Backpack is made out of rugged fabric and though it is quite heavy , the straps and loops are far from being practical, but add to looks.It looks great and can pack a lot of gear, but i woudl not buy it again. The biggest selling point for me was the fact that i could fit both cams with lenses attached, but i'd rather look for a different one that can accomplish the same thing with les weight and definitely not made out of fabric. Looks great though."
3,Pas assez profond...,"Le matériau extérieur est de bonne qualité, mais les séparations des cloisons sont trop fines et le velcro insuffisant.De plus, les dimensions en profondeur (épaisseur du sac) sont trop justes pour un boitier avec Grip style D700.Il manque également une attache haute pour éviter que les bretelles ne tombent en marchant.En résumé, ce sac est un petit sac d'appoint pour la balade et petites affaires, qui serait bien plus intéressant et pratique avec les améliorations sus-mentionnées.*"
2,dissapointed,"despite mesurements, this bell was smaller than i would have liked. i was expecting a big teacher's bell, this was small, more like a dinner bell. it was for my elderly mom to call me- i can hear it, barely. if anyone knows of those big bells like the nuns used to have let me know- that is what i need."
4,Long- handed bell could have had a longer handle.,"Though louder than the bell we had, this bell could have used a longer handle! It is not too hard to ""sound"" and serves its purpose."
5,CLASSIC,"This CD is awesome. The best Badlands put out. Healer is an awesome opener. Sun Red Sun, I think is the best song Badlands ever did. Tribal Moon is my favorite. The Fire Lasts Forever, Dog, Fat Cat, and Ride The Jack are all good too. You owe it too yourself to get this one."
2,Brian Brandywine,"In my never ending quest to find a great hard rock band with great,heavy guitar I had first heard of Jake on Ozzys BATM album . So with all of the stellar reviews , I thought , this can't miss . Well , I was wrong . What a boring typical snoozer of an album this is . I bet whoever recorded it had to snort tons of coke just to stay awake during the making of this gem . I will NEVER take stock in any customer reviews again . Next time I go to get gas in the car , I'll just leave it laying on top of the pump like I did with that great Izzy Stradlin CD I purchased a year or 2 ago . What a POS that was . Guess I go back to my old standbys from Megadeth , Peace Sells and Rust in Peace, hey , they both have Peace in the title , Maybe I need to look for other stuff with Peace in it for it to be good , because this Dusk album is a piece all right . Adios muchachos , and good luck in your quest for ""the right stuff "" , cause it ain't here with DUSK....."
1,Good reason you never heard of this CD,You wonder why you never heard of this CD? Why you never knew it was never released? Because it sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Where did this music come from? This is not the same Jake who did great stuff with Ozzy and the first two Badland records.I can't want to re-sell this CD.
5,WOW! This is Incredible!,"This is Raw, Heavy And bluesy with Melody! This is quickly becoming my favorite cd! You wont regret this, It's a mixture of the first 2 albums but with a heavy edge to it. Everyones playing on this is amazing!"
4,A Fitting Tribute to Ray Gillan,"Being a blues rock purist, I found this disc most refreshing, sadly it was the last that we heard from Ray Gillan, due to his untimely passing. Jake and the boys really turned down the lights and cranked up the amps on this record. Granted it is not as stellar as the first album, but there are some great blues rock gems on this disc, especially Fat Cat. If you are a fan of Jake E. Lee, then you need to add this to your collection.Adios from the Texas CoastCraig Williams"
2,loose but cool,"Dusk is quite different than the two previous albums in the fact that it's much more of a jam and little mistakes were kept. (timing,key) Gillan sounds great but very different which is cool because he really sings in his lower range a lot which is nice. Song writting is isn't too hot but if you dig Badlands and have the other two cd's then better get this one too."
5,Twilight Bittersweet Joy,"This CD is a poignant and bittersweet tribute to Ray Gillen. This band that rocked so competently in the 80s still displays feverish guitar riffs and stiring, powerful vocals. Anyone who is a fan of guitar driven rock must check this one out. All though not as comercial as Voodoo Highway, this work still rocks with the visceral passion that the great rock bands of the 70s and 80s all displayed. Jake E Lee is still fabulous on the fretboard.The power and virtuosity that seemed lacking in much of the rock of the 90s still lives!"
5,A Must for die-hard fans of Ray Gillen/Jake E. Lee/BADLANDS,"This album was recorded in 1993, live to tape with no overdubs. The songwriting is superb, the performances are top-notch and it's a fitting tribute to the legacy of the late, great Ray Gillen."
3,It's about time,"Finually another release from Badlands. What a great band. Too bad they are no more. Well this CD definitely isn't as good as their first two, but if your a die hard fan of the group like myself,I would recommend it."
5,buying on amazon,"i am very pleased with my purchase,the only downside was for some reason i could'nt use paypal,i was concearnd about my info being out there,but no problems so far!this is an awesome cd buy one of the most talented bands ever,with one of the greatest vocalist in rock-n-roll period!R.I.P BROTHER RAY GILLEN."
5,Not Overproduced Electric Blues Rock,"This ablum shines for what it is... AND WHAT IT IS IS AMAZING! Rarely are we moved, in a live groove experience way, by recorded material and if you loved the first two productions from these blues rock gods, this will hit the spot. Ray will be missed. Jake is awesome. Are these practically first take demos? Yes. Is every transition perfect? No. Is this TOTALLY ECLIPSED by the pure tallent of the band, and the amazing things they're doing? YES! Does this album have more soul and feel than ANYTHING else I've experienced lately? YES! Is the sound quality excellent? Yes. Enjoy..."
4,Dickens and Holmes,"I must confess to never having read the unfinished ""Mystery of Edwin Drood"", so I really don't know if the characters met in this book, and their actions as described by varous narrators, are true to the original story. All I can say is that this author does a rather good job in weaving together all of the incidents from the Dickens book into his, and then departing from there, giving the case over into the capable hands of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. There's a lot of tooing and froing, and in the end the ""mystery"" appears to be solved. My only quibble with the book is that the solution appears too easily obtained, and not really adequately explained either by Holmes, or the author. Anyway, it's a short book and useful for passing a few pleasant hours wirh our favorite British consulting detective."
5,A truly valuable contribution to the neuroscience and mental health research literature,"""A truly valuable contribution to the neuroscience and mental health research literature. It is a formidable task to cogently explain underlying mechanisms of brain function and the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders; however Dr. Pliszka's book delivers in being both replete with citations while being written in a very engaging style. His articulate explanation of the role of catecholamines in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is just one of many noteworthy examples. This book should be a required psychopathology text for all mental health clinicians-in-training.""--David R. DeLorenzo, PhD, Private Practice"
3,Worked for the first few days ...,"I have been using this unit for a few day and loved it. Now the however... the right click botton just quit working. Well, it works 1 out of 10 times. Pretty sure it isn't the battery because I replaced with new ones to see if the problem goes away.On another note - the bottons may be a little stiff and noisy for some. But I think it's acceptable.I'll contact IOGear product service tomorrow. Stay tuned..."
4,Making the Old into New,"Vol 2 of Troublesome Bible Passages continues with the valuable background, interpretations and commentary found in Volume 1. At times the commentary can be a bit off the wall in both of these works, but after all, they deal with troubling words to begin with. In using these with adult study groups, we have had provocative, sometimes even disturbing discussions. But I know we've been led to better understanding and respect for other's beliefs. A very satisfying experience that we all look forward to in the next lesson."
5,great quality,Book was just what I ordered and in great condition. Very pleased with my order. Saved money for my Sunday School Class.
1,Another appalling Christian Kim poetry book!,'Jesus the Radical' really is utter rot. It is by far the worst poetry book I've ever read.The poems just ramble on like the dreary drone of a lecturer in the most boring subject imaginable i.e. Tax law. I almost fell asleep after reading about five poems. The content was complete and utter drivel; yet again Kim focuses on the idea that Christians must kill Jews. Kim seems to be completely obsessed with the Jews.The book was full of errors and inconsistencies. I wonder if Kim even bothered to edit the book. This book should be avoided; it really is drivel of the worst sort.
1,Terrible,"Another example of Kim's terrible poetry! The poems are frustrating to read and distort the Bible. I find it hard to believe that Kim persists in writing poetry; he really doesn't have a clue about what makes a good poem. These poems are likely to offend many Christians as they inaccurately portray Jesus Christ in a bad light and justify the hatred felt by certain detractors towards our lord 2,000 years ago.These poems are absolute drivel and should be avoided at all costs!"
3,Not current,This cartridge is not current. My kid has a 2005 textbook which is not in the cartridge.
2,Who knew?,"Who would have thought that my son's 5th grade Social studies book wouldn't be included on this cartridge? When the item description didn't mention that it wouldn't be compatible with all curriculums, I didn't think twice about ordering this. My school system uses all of the mainstream text books, yet I keep striking out with these cartridges because none of our books are included in any of the subjects. Amazon should list the textbooks that are included on the cartridges in the product description. It would be easy enough, as the books are listed right on the back of the package."
3,Interesting,"This disc contains some of Philip Glass' early organ works, showcasing the repetitive style that made him famous. the first and last tracks on the CD are more repetitive than the middle track, and are somewhat like musical ""paintings"", not meant to be actively listened to, but just played in the background, where you can visit them from time to time.The middle track, ""Mad Rush"", might be rushy but certainly isn't mad. It is in a strict formal structure, with a quiet theme contrasted by a fst, loud theme, and going back and forth between the two. This track is overall the most enjoyable on the CD.I don't understand the two versions of ""One+One""; first why are they on an ""Early Keyboard Works"" CD, and second, I've just never been able to understand the intricate complexities of music meant to be played by banging on a tabletop."
5,UNA OBRA TRAGICA Y CLASICA,"escrita de manera impecable... al extremo de que al leer, casi puede uno ver las imagen y con un importante trasfondo moral..."
5,I like this product!,"I bought the Megular's Complete Car Care kit and have begun personal care for my new Prius. No automatic car washes for this TOYota.The birds have given me a fit, but this Quik Detailer and a Bounty paper towel do a quick effortless clean-up every time the birds strike! Cleans and brings out the shine."
4,Good....but not as great as earlier albums,"I've been a sugababes fan for years and have enjoyed all of their albums, from the more a cappalla one touch to the more dance Three. I looked forward to this album, but was a little dissapointed when I got it. The songs are still quite good (I still can't see why they haven't caught on in the US - I think that they are superior to many things on the radio now), I'm just don't think that the album has that same unique songs that you jump out at you like earlier albums do. Overall, it's great driving music, very repetitive in general is my one real criticism, several of the songs don't have many verses but just a repetitive chorus."
1,Not Like Me,"Not a poorly written book, and mildly entertaining on a superficial level as an autobiography. But much like the spiritual ramblings I've seen on numerous occasions on public access TV, I find the enlightenment bestowed upon the masses by Gangaji to be vacuous and self-important. While it's a heartening journey she's undertaken to find peace with her own life, and admirable that she wants to share that with people seeking their own direction, I find her ""teachings"" to have an irritating smugness and all the substance of a bag of air. One must question the spiritual enlightenment of one who sells pictures of themselves on their own web site.An Ok read purely for entertainment...seek enlightenment elsewhere."
2,Natural materials?!?,"I fail to see how polymer clay, paraffin wax, tacky glue and acrylic paint are natural materials. In addition, the actual natural materials used for these uninspired and basic crafts are generally things one can't find in their own backyard - spanish moss, sheets of bark, grapevines, etc. This book was extremely disappointing in content, with simple and unoriginal ideas. The ""love-the Earth"" message reminds me of all those supposedly ""green"" products that purport to be earth-friendly but actually fall far short - considering the amazing amount of earth-unfriendly materials used in the majority of the crafts."
2,More Creativity Needed,It is a great start if you have never created art wth natural materials but it would be best used with children under 8 years of age. The project ideas are basic and do not match the capabilities of the children's imaginations. The premise of the book is great but it is disappointing inside. Keep looking is my advice!
2,"Ok, But the Cover is the Best Part of This Book.","Out of all the projects featured in the book, I probably would only make one or two. A lot of the materials for the projects are not easily found in my neighborhood, which was something I was hoping for in a book like this."
2,nature-wash,"This book seems awesome at first glance. I bought it at an honest-to-god bookstore after having looked at a few projects. Came home and immediately tried our luck with the twig basket with my daughter - instructions called for 20-24 sticks which would not ever work out to make the whole thing.Then I noticed the extremely heavy use of hot glue throughout the book. Not exactly a natural material. I own a hot glue gun, but we made the basket by tying the twigs together with twine rather than hot glueing.There being no photographs, I wonder if some of these projects are maybe a tad 'theoretical' in nature.My daughter is still extremely into the book and has a long list of things she wants to make. This is where the 2 stars come from. Maybe I'll amend my opinion if things change."
1,don't buy,"I love creative ideas especially when the materials used are abundant and easy to find, unfortunately there is more creativity in the illustrations of this book than the ideas for crafts (I give it one star for this reason alone). This book proves that ANYONE can publish a book. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Disappointing,"A few of the diary entries were interesting to read (I especially liked the story of the china doll), but the quilt blocks were a major disappointment. Each block was named after an entry in the corresponding diary entry rather than by its commonly used name. No patterns given for the blocks, only a line diagram and a small picture of an actual fabric block. Civil War Women by Barbara Brackman is a much better choice for historical background, diary entries and actual patterns."
4,great reading on a cold night,If you love history and quilting then you'll love reading this book! The diary accounts are in great detail about life during the civil war. And they're in the writers own words which makes you feel like you're right there! I found myself picking up this book and reading it each night. Even up to the last story which stole my heart!! But this is not a book for a beginner quilter. You will find enough block patterns to keep you busy for years! Yet there are no instructions for making the six inch blocks. That you have to figure on your own. But I found the book worth reading anyway!
1,Quilting Book,"I still do not have the item I ordered, It might be that I am overseas, but usually it does not take a month to receive something. I will come back when or if I get the item."
3,Civil war diary quilt,"Very interesting stories. Quilting instructions are lacking, not for a beginner if you want to piece the blocks. You could paper piece them as they have full size pictues of the blocks."
5,The Civil War Diary Quilt,I purchased the 3 books and this was my favourite. I love the quilt blocks but also the stories that give you a glimpse into peoples lives during this time.
4,Informative collection of patterns,This book combines history from a personal perspective - using letters - with a nice collection of designs.
2,Cheesy 70's Electro-Music,"I bought this CD because it was a West German pressing, and I figured that early on (in the life of CD's), they'd only be releasing good, back-catalog stuff from artists like Nelson Riddle. Unfortunately, this is not representative of his big band work. Most of the tracks remind me of the awful music they played on Disneyland's Peoplemover back in the 70's. There are a couple good tracks that don't evoke the 1970's and are instead lush and traditionally orchestral--but not enough of then to make me want to keep this CD in my collection: West German or not."
3,Working with the bias,"The main theme of the book is how to use the bias to quickly construct quilts and to do this _after_ you have sewn much of the quilt top together. I haven't made anything in this book yet because I don't understand how you can incorporate the 1/4"" for the seam allowance when you cut your work in half on the bias."
1,A real Disappointment,"This detector works very poorly. Although it is a new model, the technology seems less effective than that of radar detectors I owned many years ago. I am going to replace it with something I can count on, like the Bell models."
3,"Good for radar, awful for laser","I have had this radar detector for six months. I purchased it after getting a $300 ticket. I will say it has saved me a number of times. It's radar detection is very good. I have never failed to be alerted to a cop using radar. However, Its laser coverage is highly lacking (I just got a ticket yesterday from a laser gun). It has never alerted me to a laser signal. despite the fact that I have driven by a number of officers using laser guns. If the police in your area use laser, don't get this detector. It doesn't work. However, if you want great radar detection this unit is very good and inexpensive."
5,One of the top reggae albums of all time,"A must for any roots reggae fan. 'Jah Pretty Face', 'Two Sevens Clash' and 'I'm Not Ashamed' are worth the price of the cd alone. Pick this one up!"
4,We go ride the lion!,"This album is awesome. I haven't heard it in years, but man I used to own it and every single song was great. Culture is all about amazing harmonies and Hill's mesmerizing gravelly vocals.Truth is I probably would have given this five stars back when I was in highschool, but now I am so far removed from this album and that age that I can only review it based on how great I remember it to be, rather than how much I currently enjoy it.This is a highly recommended album however. Better than just about every Bob Marley album (talk about overrated, though Marley had maybe three or four classic albums and his early stuff rules, not one of his albums is a bonafide barn burning hypnotic historical document in the Handsworth Revolution, Tribute to the Martyrs, or Marcus Garvey tradition), this album belongs just below some of the greatest reggae albums ever produced.This is a must have if you love this type of music, and a very good purchase if your just a music lover with an open mind."
4,GOOD,"CULTURE IS ONE OF THE TOP ACT THAT HELP WITH THE BADLY NEEDED UPGRADE IN REGGAE MUSIC SOUND IN THE 70'S , JUST GET A HOLD OF 2 OF THAIR HIT SINGLE ,BALD HEAD BRIDGE, AND ZION GATE.THIS THIS IS A HARD DRIVING HIT U IN THE FACE NO NONSENSE KIND OF MUSIC.BEST RHYTHM AND A CULTRAL MESSAGES YOU CAN DANCE AND RELATE TO WHAT MOORE DO YOU WANT.PEACE."
5,Pick up Cultures other equally Classic Cd's,This is a great Culture release no question. But pick up these other equally classis Culture releases that know one seems to know about or talk about- INTERNATIONAL HERB & HARDER THEN THE REST. They are just as good as 2-7s Clash or better. Then you will want to get 7 or 8 other great Culture Cd's. Joeseph Hill is da man.
4,this is a good album but intern. herb rules,"this is a good album but international herb is better. the latter album is a good introduction to the group. i saw culture in concert recently and most of the songs performed were from IH.there are some good songs on this album. you cannot go wrong with the title song. marcus garvey's black starliner is a common theme throughout the album (this is one of the album's high points). favorite songs on the albums are: get ready to ride the lion to zion, black starliner must come, see them a come, natty dread taking over (which is wickedly good), and of course, two seven clash."
2,Not What I Expected !,When I purchased this book I was looking for a dictionary full of words that a novice would not understand reguarding computers. Instead I ended up with a book with limited definitions and silly jokes ! If I had time I would have returned it ! Half the definitions I look up arent even in the book. Save your money and buy a better dictionary.
4,A great reference in addition to your library,"This book is exactly what the title implies. If you find yourself having little difficulty describing a computer term, then you can turn to this reference. Everything is in alphabetical order and comes with simple illustrations. Before the alphabet there are medic characters any of these are described.Due to the accelerating advances in technology many terms are not in this edition."
5,"OBCON Dual 12"" Slot Vented Hatchback Speaker Enclosure","I love this box it looks awsome,it sounds awsome,and with the 2 PYLE subs i put in it at 3200 watts each,and a boss 3000watt class D amp the whole neiborhood can hear it."
2,Unintentionally amusing book from 20th century Nostradamus,"Century 21 was written in 1968. The author makes optimistic predictions about life in the year 2001. A few are dead-on accurate, such as determining the sex of children before their birth. A few are conceivable, if you stretch your imagination; for example, he predicts the widespread use of happy pills (Prozac?). But most are just complete nonsense, which is what makes the book so amusing. However, hindsight only entertains for the first hundred pages or so, and the book becomes tiresome."
5,Great,"I got this not needing much more than a simple device to use for memos and schedules, but now I find it is the PDA I use the most. The keyboard, while by no means perfect, is easier than writing on the screen, ala the Palm series. Also, it has plenty of memory for what I needed (who needs more than 1.5 Mb for memos?), and the interface is very simple to learn and use. Also, it is smaller than most PDAs, and for what you pay for those, you dont get much more (sure, on the more expensive ones you get full word processers, but why would you type a full document on one of these anyway?) Overall, a recommended purchase."
1,You've got to be kidding,"I have one of these things I bought about 12 years ago for around twenty bucks and I liked it while it worked.I would buy another one for around twenty bucks again, but over three hundred? What kind of jackass would pay such a ludicrous price for that thing?"
2,Not very practicle organizer. Key functions poorly laid out.,"Download functions did not work thoroughly. Keyboard functions laid out very poorly. Removal of number pad a big mistake. Entering or working with numbers a pain. Secondary functions are not consistent. It's attractive, but not functional."
5,Great Clense,"I thought this product worked very well, I never had any ""run to the bathroom"" moments...which I was scared of. There are tons of pills though"
3,SHOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT TITLE,"I found this to be an interesting book for its coverage of historical events within Austria during the 20th century (i.e., the fall of the Hapsburg monarchy and the Nazi occupation). Brook-Shepherd goes into pretty good detail on these events. However, he devotes much of the book to the 20th Century, and, in a seeming contradiction to the title, does not give as much attention to pre-20th Century developments. For example, he does not give much detail about Maria Therea or Joesph II. Perhaps he should have devoted the book to only the 20th Century."
3,"Informative, but not what I was looking for","The title is somewhat misleading. Perhaps the first third of the book covers the period up to the turn of the century. The rest of the book covers the past 100 years. The author dwells on his own contacts (such as with the last Empress of Austro-Hungary), and while they are, of course, valid and lends credibility and interest, he does tend to dwell on some of the convolutions of failed plots and uprisings that never happened. It is a good explanation of the Austrian ""character"", but I wish he had gone into more detail of the preceding history, instead of dwelling on the WWII era."
3,Content doesn't match title,"The title of this book is misleading. This is because Mr. Brooke-Shepherd devotes most of his attention to 20th century events in Austria. As a result, he neglects some very important (not to mention interesting) material from before that time. For example, he spends little time discussing the Habsburgs' long tenure as Holy Roman Emperors. Moreover, he neglects the rise of such influential Austrians as Maria Theresa, Joseph II, and Metternich. The book is good in what it covers, but, as earlier stated, is equally memorable for what it doesn't cover."
4,Useful to inform ploarized dialogues about homosexuality,"Mondimore's book helps shed light on a subject where more heat than light is perennially generated. As a pastor who deals with the issue and needed basic information to inform my views, Mondimore does a valuable service for readers looking to research the often misinformed and misunderstood issues around homosexuality. The book follows a well thought out sequence and it is clearly written. Most valuable are the sections on the history, anthropology and sexual biology of homosexuality. As the church wrestles with this topic --from an often uninformed and polarized position, Mondimore's book can be a useful reference tool to explore and dialogue about the issues."
2,"ANCIENT AUDIO, BUY THE 2007 REMASTER INSTEAD","In 2007, Universal UK released a 2CD set,Gold, that is actually Addictions Volumes 1 & 2 remastered.The original Addictions CD's are well over 15 years old, and completely out-of-date, from an audio-quality perspective.The remastered sound is great; all RP fans should divest the two older discs and get the Gold set."
3,Enjoyable,Typical well written book from this author. I would have liked the characters to have a little more depth. It was worth the price.
4,Ignore the picture on the cover; this book was very good,"I thought the book was wonderful. I would like to have had afew more pages at the end, though. It ended a bit abruptly for me, but it was a good ending. Ignore the cheesy cover -- neitherEric or Maddlyn look anything like the couple on the cover. Irather doubt they had [...] implants back in the 1800's, asMaddlyn's picture would suggest on the cover. Eric had a bit ofa hairy chest in the book, but the fellow on the cover has thetypical hair-free look. Also, Maddlyn (aka Goldilocks) hair wasblonde, not nearly so red as the picture on the cover, and theclothes she is (almost)wearing on the cover are not the clothesshe wore in the book. I enjoyed the funny moments in the book,especially the way Karl & Conrad always kept Eric & Maddlyn ata safe distance from one another."
4,Case Logic bag gets it right,"I purchased this bag to accompany my Sony Digital 8 TRV-103. It fits great - not too tight, just enough room inside for a tape or two if needed. The side pouch is a little tight, but has enough room for the remote control, two tapes and a spare battery, plus an AV cable. My only critique is that the bag doesn't have enough space for the AC adapter. While it fits in the main compartment with the camera, it's a pain to juggle it around when removing/replacing the camera. Nice leather-esque outside and rigged bottom. A good bet for a small camcorder."
4,I think you're ugly on the inside,"So far this has been a horribly disappointing year for new music.Thankfully, Punchline is one of the few bright spots. They're kind of like Fall Out Boy meets At The Drive In. This is great pop-punk music and under the Fueled By Ramen label, that's no real surprise.This isn't anything groundbreaking exactly, it's not an album that will ""change your life,"" it is however, highly enjoyable and will have you singing along the second time through.I like the sing-talking thing they do in some of there songs. It adds a more dramtic element and makes you listen more closely.It's worth the 10 bucks if you're into this genre. You won't be disappointed.Standout tracks:""The Getaway""""For THe Second Time""""The Fake, The Snake, and the Birthday Cake"""
3,Pretty good,I think this album is pretty good. Greg Wood does a great job. However I liked the harmony between Steve Sobasli and Paul Menotiades better [on the Action album].
1,ZzZzZzZ,"Tell me again how fans of Hit The Lights could also be recommended anything by punchline? Amazon seriously needs to update it's recommendations, because if weezer and fountains of wayne got together and did b-sides, it would probably sound like a majority of the material on '37 everywhere'. I despise weezer, so of course, this is going to be a problem for me. Why do people like this anyway? Can some one tell me whats so great about music that's slow and boring, music that has no energy or character? What truly inspires someone to give glowing reviews to a record that'll put you to sleep in 10 minutes? It must be a trend thing, cuz I just don't see how anyone could sit through '37 everywhere' and say 'wow, that was good'."
1,Wouldn't buy again,I installed this product according to instructions and it printed out horrible streaked copies with a greyish background.
5,Replacement Cartridge,"This cartridge was incredibly well priced, and every bit as good as the one I was going to buy at Staples, but $100 less. I can think of a lot to do with that extra money! Works great."
4,Great Wire Jewelry How To Book,I love this book. It has step by step instructions simple enough for anyone to follow. Huge variety of techniques makes this book a great purchase. I wish I had found it sooner.
2,Awful Awful Layout,"Like other reviewers, I bought this book (along with Woven Wire Jewelry by Chandler and Ritchey) thinking how on earth could a book be that bad. It was. The layout is simply amateurish and the photography of the projects isn't on the same level as other instructional books I have.The directions are ok, provided you have some experience working with wire and don't need to see a picture to know you're doing the step correctly.The projects are not particularly inspired, although there was one stringing technique, more of a beading technique than wire, that I made as the necklace and reused as a bracelet as well, with terrific results.You may find a project or two in here that strikes your fancy, which would make the purchase of the book worthwhile, but if you're looking for a solid instructional book with plenty of demonstative photos, skip this one and go for Woven Wire Jewely. It's a much better investment."
2,Beware of incorrect instructions,"I don't have the same problem the other readers have (although I agree the layout could have been better): My problem is with the first project I attempted in the book (a chainmaille-type necklace)... the sizes of the materials asked for do not jive once you try them. If you've ever worked with wire before you'll know that 2.8mm, 20 gauge jump rings will not link together many 5mm,18 gauge jump rings. The 2.8mm rings are WAY too small! I bought the jump rings because I did not want to wrap my own and than attempted the project only to realize this problem. Now I have to buy new sizes and try to figure out what will be large enough to work together. The pictures are nice and some of the projects look very interesting which is why I wanted to try it but having errors in the instructions is just going to frustrate readers...like myself!"
4,I like it,"While this may not be the most comprhensive book I have ever seen on this subject, I find it to be quite attractive and useful. I have been artsy/craftsy for a LONG time, and have seen more than my share of pattern/craft/idea books, so I think I have a decent basis of comparison. A very good book for those just getting interested in using textile techniques with wire."
4,silver wire jewelry,"This book is pretty detailed and has interesting designs to try. The only thing I didn't like about it was the pictures of the finished work is not listed on the page where the instructions are. While making a new piece of jewelry, I do like to have the picture on the same page so I can compare what I am doing to the finished work pictured in the book. Otherwise, this book is pretty good."
5,Best Book yet for Beginners,I decided at the first of the year that I wanted to pursue my long-time desire to learn to water color. Since that time I've purchased dozens of books for beginners and this is by far the best one yet. Most of them tell you instead of show you and this one is more user friendly. I would have loved to have met this author so he could have instructed me one on one. No book can teach you everything but this is the one I've learned the most from. He starts very simply and then progresses adding a little more to each lesson. I definitely would recommend it to anyone just starting out.
4,Watercolor,The Watercolor Basics is a help. I enjoy painting and have added the book to my library for future use and reference.
4,Good basic book,"Although it is a little to detailed to what the author likes, it is informative and a good basic book to use to start painting."
5,Watercolor Basics,This book is very helpful to the new painter like me. I am enjoying using it and and learning from it. Thank you.
5,Very nice book for beginners,"The taget audience of ""Watercolor Basics"" is people who want to learn watercolor painting from scratch. This book presumes no prior knowledge of art or painting or drawing. The lessons make good use of step-by-step examples to demonstrate watercolor techniques and help the reader reproduce those techniques. Normally I abhor step-by-step examples, but these are very well done and really quite helpful. People with a lot of experinece in drawing or painting other mediums will find this book a quick read but still useful."
5,Good book for an absolute beginner,"I just started with watercolor and am an absolute beginner, full of expectations and fears. I bought several books ""for beginners"" at the same time. All of them give you a list of supplies and helpful advises on what kind of paper, brushes, paints you need etc. That helps if you are a beginner. Most of those books then give a short review of different techniques. Than, many of them leave you alone in front of beautiful paintings with short comments. It obviously addressed to people with some experience in painting who may learn from it.The book of Jack Reid is exactly what it says on it's cover: it helps you to get started. After usual introductions it gives you many projects to develop and practice your skills starting form easiest exercises. (You just play with your brushes and get use to watercolor paints first). That's encouraging and valuable if you can `t attend a workshop. I would recommend it for a beginner as myself."
3,Am I missing something?,"In the picture, it looks like it comes with a rechargeable battery for the Cannon ELPH camera, but mine only came with the two cables."
5,Wonderful book and illustrations on colonial homebuilding,"Even for the novice, this book is easy to understand.A historical look at the ingenuity of home building.Several interesting anecdotes as well about the originof various terminology and the chronology of various practicesand innovations. Raise the bent and connect the girt because the summer beams are here! (-:"
5,Colonial books are fun to read,I wish I had a time machine to go back and live in colonial days in America. This is a really nice book.
5,Boris is Great,Boris is outstanding in the Peter and the Wolf suite. Orchestration and sound mixing is excellent.
1,Simply Doesn't Work,"Look carefully at the picture above. There's a popsicle tray, then a metal top that goes over it with small slits for popsicle sticks, which are all resting out of the tray at slightly different angles. (In real life, it's impossible to get them to stay even that straight.) So, to skip to the punchline, when you try to remove the metal tray, you can't, since the sticks aren't straight, and aren't all slanted in the same direction. Pulling out the tray ends up dislodging all of the popsicles at the same time. It breaks some, and it's an enormous hassle. This is an awful product that, clearly, was never tested before being put on the market."
2,OUCH! Sharp Edges!,"I bought this yesterday from a store locally, and struggled to get the top off today in the same way the reviewer above did. I didn't even mind that so much--it was the deep gash in my index finer I got from holding the metal edge that pissed me off!I have emailed the manufacturer, but figured I'd warn folks on here as well.The old tinfoil with the sticks stuck through works best, I guess. I'll save the bottom and do that. That top is a hazard."
4,Missing the ingrediants you really want to know about,"If you are a cook and sometimes come across ingrediants you have never seen (or can't pronounce) this is *not* the book for you. It is missing most of that stuff. Example recipes would be helpful, too. However, as a general western reference with good illustrations, it fits the bill nicely. I open mine about once a month to look up something. Great as a gift and even better to receive as a present!"
4,Beautifully illustrated and highly useful,"I got this book about 16 years ago and I still use it often, especially when I encounter a food for the first time.I also just flip through the pages to get inspired to try new foods. It got me to try rutabaga with simple tips on how to select and prepare them. Although it does contain recipes for each entry, it isn't a cookbook, but a ""encyclopedia"" that gives you a lot to think about. And the illustrations are beautiful and will seduce you into trying new foods. It makes a beautiful gift."
4,OVERALL OK,"I shopped around for similar cases. I found them all way overpriced. This particular one is an OK value relative to others however, do not expect it to be capable of enduring the punishment of a well constructed aluminum case. It is made mostly of cardboard and chrome-coated plastic exterior, including the handle, with few metal components. Nevertheless, it does have expensive looks, and it should do the job protecting your equipment on day to day house to office trips. Not a bad choice overall. Prompt delivery, good packaging, by seller Galactics""."
4,best for SLR camera,"Could be a little more sturdy. But good enough for most amateur photographers. Best organizer for everything yet,and you can keep it all with you."
2,Frustrating!!!,"One of the most frustrating pieces of equipment I have ever bought. The legs need to be fully extended for them to securely lock into place, if not, a simple adjust to the camera causes the leg(s)to collapse. Get set for that perfect picture, press zoom, there goes the leg. Better off buying a tripod with individually locking leg sections."
