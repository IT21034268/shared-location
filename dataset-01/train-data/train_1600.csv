1,Worked great for the first few days...,"This remote worked awesome for the first few days that I had it, but after that it is almost impossible to use it at any volume being that all I can hear now is feedback from the device through my home theater."
4,a cautious tale,"After recently beginning Paul Alexander's biography, I was delighted to stumble upon Ian Hamilton's cautious, yet entertaining, meta-biography. He doesn't dwell and gets on with his story. Hamilton does a great job of exposing the split personality of the biographer: as both neophyte and leech upon the creative world. Hamilton questions the validity of the ""simplest"" details of his subject's secret life. His honesty and reverence for Salinger result in a well-executed piece of writing; the best I've read anyway."
3,Hamilton's quest for Salinger,"The major problem with this book is that it only covers Salinger's life from 1919 to 1965. After this date, Hamilton only put a kind of resume of the trial that opposed him to Salinger. It sure is an interesting book to read, but there is way too much quotations and somehow you feel that you could've learned more. I suggest Paul Alexander's biography instead. It's more complete, even though he owes a lot to Hamilton who was one of the first to make profound researches about Salinger."
3,"Decent, not great, book","I picked this up because I thought the lead character sounded interesting: a Nigerian teenager, who is named Elvis, who is also an Elvis impersanator.By the end of the book though, I hardly feel like I know Elvis. I feel like I better know his friend Redemption (great name) even though he only appears a few times. I could even imagine the King of Beggars (another great name) better than Elvis. He just was very blah as a central character. By the end of the book I almost found him annoying.There are so many of Elvis' stories thrown in the book that it becomes too much to be cohesive.However, there are enough interesting insights into life in Nigeria in the early 80s to make it interesting.As a side note, I found the dropping of the music that was playing in the background to be annoying. It seemed like the author was trying to show how ""real"" and ""authentic"" the music is to the time and setting. It just felt really forced in there and it stuck out noticeably to me."
3,A kind people in a ruthless society,"Before reading Graceland, I knew very little about Nigeria and its people. I ended the book never wanting to visit Nigeria but with a deep appreciation for the heart of its people. Despite a terrible, wicked government and utter poverty, the common people in this novel are shown to be kind and supportive to each other in the face of overwhelming odds. The hero willingly shares his little money with his friends and beggars. After enduring torture, he still cares about the innocence of a world-weary twelve year old beggar. He is at heart a highly moral character in an immoral society. The novel is very easy to read and is often humorous. The humor, however, is just a thin veneer over the sadness of this society. Graceland left me hoping that the Nigerians will one day have the government and country that they deserve."
2,Tried to like it,"Very noble premise for the book, but I just could not identify with ANY of the characters; much less the main character. Left it on the metro after reading only 1/2 of it."
1,Hard work,"This was the first book I saw in the store in my search for a good summer read. The cover intrigued me and so did the description of a young African Elvis impersonator trying to make a life for himself. Who wrote the summary of this book? Did they even read it? It's not what this book is about at all.This book is interesting at first. As I read on, I kept trying to find where this book was going. This is difficult as the book switches between the past and the present; unfortunately the two are never reconciled.About half way through, I found myself skimming through the remaining pages, scanning for a semblance of a plot. No luck.I gave up on this book- it's just too much work."
2,Graceland: A Novel,"I didn't care for this book. I found it to be very choppy, with the storyline starting and stopping before it was really developed. Characters were not developed properly and the recipes were annoying. Maybe I missed something here, but this book did not work for me."
4,its ok...,"The mem card is ok, but not great. This card needs more blocks if u have lots of games. So you have to buy another memory card to save, especially if u have madden."
3,"Saves, but it's too small!","This is a memory card, yes, but it is way too small. I have four games (SSB, FIFA, Rogue leader, and Pikmin) and I can not fit the saves from these 4 games onto this card. Advice: either buy the 8 MB card, or wait for the SD card. Then again, you will probably have to get one of these for now (other companies have to reverse engineer their cards)"
4,Critical gaming item.,"Ah, the memory card. Probably one of the most critical items to enjoying your gaming experience (besides the console, game and controller, of course). Without this nifty little flat cube-ish wonder, consoles would have to be left on overnight. This means not only does the console overheat (which will turn out extremely bad after a few weeks), electricity bills, oh my!But seriously, memory cards are used for saving records, gaming progress and a plethora more. I have seen no problem with the Memory Card 59 for Nintendo, besides a POSSIBLE lack of space. I haven't had time to invest in too many games (own two, rented one) and there's still space left over (duh!), but one game takes up nearly 1/5th of the space, though I don't know if this is a regular occurence. There should be nothing in the way of you buying this, seeing how important it is.Indubitably."
5,nice,"i thought it'd be too small but nintendo are really smart about this I guess, most games take up very little space.And the card costs a bunch less than most other cards."
3,MEMORY CARD 59,"I HAVE A NINTENDO GAMECUBE AND I MUST SAY THAT WITH ALL OF THE GAMES I PLAY ON IT, I NEED MORE MEMORY THAN JUST 59 BLOCKS. FOR THE SERIOUS GAMER, IN MY OPINION, YOU SHOULD PURCHASE THE MEMORY CARD 251. THIS UNIT HAS ROUGHLY 4 TIMES THE MEMORY SPACE AND WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY. FOR TWICE THE PRICE YOU GET FOUR TIMES THE MEMORY SPACE."
3,Its okay... I guess.,"If you like a lot of games then this isn't for you. Why? 2 words.TOO SMALL! I I have saved a maximum of 4 or 5 games and thats it. I tried playing Animal Crossing and it needs 1 file and 1 block. Even if I deleted all my saves I wouldnt be able to save it. If you have a memory card 59 already, don't throw it away. Just get another memory card. I recommend Mega Memory x16. 944 blocks! Hope this helps!"
3,"Good, but could be better","Hey, its the standard memory card.....great for most games, they don't take up that much space.....but when i went to save my madden season, i found that it takes up a whole memory card! this forces you to buy more than one (if you happen to buy that great game) and just spend more money....other than that, i guess its pretty good."
3,"Reliable, but small","I'm not quite sure why Nintendo even bothered releasing this memory card given it's relativly small memory capacity. But if there is one thing I can attest to it's that Nintendo's first party memory cards are far more reliable than those developed by other companies.Reliability Rating: 5 StarsCapacity Size Rating: 2 StarsBut since the Memory Card 59 only slightly cheaper than Nintendo's now availiable Memory Card 251, I would highly encourage you to pick up the 251 instead. You will not be dissapointed."
4,Memory Card 59!,"This is a great and very reliable memory card. Yet I highly suggest grabbing the 251 card, since it only costs five bucks more for 4 times the space. You'll eventually need to buy a second (or third, or even fourth depending on how many games you own) memory card, so why not upgrade for five bucks instead of wasting 40 bucks on new 59 cards? Hope this helps you, and enjoy your Gamecube!"
5,you will need this,"when you buy your game cube there are 3 things you will need a controller, the game Super Mario Sunshine and this. it is impossible to play any game with out it"
4,great product.,"doesn't lose data, holds enough for most games, but more is always better. just buy the 251, it's a better deal."
3,Without this... You just CAN'T play,"There's not much to say about a memory card. It saves games, saves changes in your GameCube also, in the Calendar... I like its design, it's really little. It had to be, because the Slots for Memory Cards at the GameCube are little. The bad thing about it is that it doesn't have too much memory. In my case, with three games, the memory from the Memory Card was over... But it's not that bad. And you can't play games without it... The Memory Card is very useful."
3,Memory Card 59 Needs More Blocks!,Almost everything that Memory Card 59 contains is great. The only problem I have with Memory Card 59 is that it contains only 59 blocks. Some games use up much more than 59 blocks such as NCAA Football 2003 which uses more than 220 blocks. I would not recommend that you buy Memory Card 59. What you should buy is the new Memory Card 251 which contains over four times as many blocks as Memory Card 59 does. And it doesn't cost that much more than Memory Card 59.
3,Good for most games...,"This memory card 59 is perfect for beginners or people with very few games. I found that it has enough memory for most games, but you will find that some games (like Pikmin) can take up to half the memory. Also If you are a fan of sports games, don't buy this. Madden alone needs 59 blocks and other games, like NCAA Football 2003 take over 200 blocks. ..."
3,"Fine for most, Small for some","The memory card does it's job, but has limited space. Some games require less than 15 blocks, and so several can fit on one card. It's nice to store a single card with each game disc, but that can become expensive, essentially adding 15.00 to each game title.In the case of Madden 2002, you use a full card if you want to save a season, plus you need additional blocks to save any settings or user information. Simply, unless you want to re-enter information, you need 2 cards for Madden alone.It would be nice to see the cards drop to a more reasonable rate of around 5 bucks per 59 blocks of memory, and I wait anxiously for a card that holds mega-blocks of memory, or an adapter to utilize flash memory.I have only encountered one off brand gamecube memory card, and it only saves you about 3 dollars in cost, has no more memory, and doesn't fit into the storage case memory card holder because it is longer than the Nintendo branded card."
4,A MUST,This is something you MUST have or else you ALWAYS have to start your games all over. Too bad it only has 52 Blocks :( because most games use A LOT of Blocks.
1,"59 Blocks, 4Mb? Pathetic","A major disappointment on an otherwise nice system. Beware, 4Mb is only 512K, about a third of that on a floppy drive. If you are a serious gamer and would like to do anything other than save the BARE minimum, try to hold out until real cards, or the SD-Adapter is available. I have about a dozen games, and have 2 cards completely filled. I have had to delete many features within games, such as replays, custom skate parks, multiple seasons, etc.. because of the lack of space available. Madden 2002- 59 blocks ALONE just for franchise mode, then even more memory for saving anything else. FIFA 2002- 29 blocks right there. 1 SSX tricky replay- 29 blocks. Pikmin- 19 blocks.(EA must not know how to keep stuff small, they tend to be the biggest offenders). I am definately waiting for the 8MB (although, judging by past errors, it could only be 8Mb, 1/8th the size)."
1,A REALLY BAD MEMORY CARD,"I have this only because it is necessary, but you need more than one memory card to do the job. Games use a lot of space in the memory card, you may need one memory card per game! I think it is too expensive because it DOESN'T do the job very well."
4,I need memory!!!,The reason I gave this a 4 is because I have heard that Panasonic might make a 64megabyte memory card. Other than that it is quite useful for saving games.
4,59? Go with 256.,"Memory Card 59. It should be Memory HARD 59, Because you can't save more than 5 games data on it. Really. My Bro and I had to erase data to make room for other save files. Almost every time we wanted to play we had to move data or organize.Basically, get the Memory Card 256 and keep your sanity..."
2,Not quite worth the money for the price,"You won't have any troubles using this device with your system unless you buy a game like Animal Crossing, a game which uses all but one slot on the entire memory card . If you're a gamer and you're looking to spend as few dollars as possible do yourself a favor and purchase the Memory Card 251 right off the bat to prevent you from buying several of the 59's over the next few years."
2,"Way too little memory, despite what they say.","This costs way too much, it hold way too little, spend the extra for the 251 or whatever. This will run out immediately, especially with owning TH3, RE and Smash Bros. Melee."
2,59?,I rented Madden and it need 59 blocks for the season mode alone. I suggest buy one of these for quality. Then buy the memory card 16X. It holds 16x more. But I had one like that for PSX and it deleted sometimes. (3 times)But its worth it. I would store the most important games on memory card 59.
2,I think the progress should be saved on the game.,"I the way the progress saved on the pak it's self n N64. I would like the games to save on the disk. Either that or you should get one pack with the game cube it's self. Also, if you buy a pack for each game, you have to pay 65$. you only used tohave to pay like 40-50$ for a game, and you could save it. i think that games are cool though! ;-)"
5,The Must-Have Card,"The Memory Card 59 is a great memory card. Without one, you can't save games. If you can't save games, there is at least a 50 percent cut in the fun level in the GCN. I know you are all thinking: ""Why can't we just save the games without memory cards?"" One, it's not possible to do that with discs, two, even if we could save without memory cards, the glorious Gamecube wouldn't be as good because it takes up space for saving instead of great graphics, super sound, and more. It's gaming suicide to not buy this card!There are 59 blocks of memory avaliable, more than enough if you don't play excessive sports games. You should be able to put a lot of things on just one of the cards for a standard card. This is a great card, and it only costs $$$ on this site!If you don't have one, get one or two right now!"
4,Lots of room if you don't have too many sports games,"If you thought that .5 MB wasn't going to be nearly enough, you probably didn't know that most games only take up about8 or 9 slots on the card, which has 59 slots. But if you're looking to save sports games on here, you'll probably have to buy more than one if you want to fit other games on it too because those sports saved games take up tons of room. But still, for 15 dollars it's easy to buy another one."
4,"Mini memory card, but not mini space","Even though it only has 59 blocks and a few games use 1-3 blocks at the moment, it still has more than adaquite space. I have WaveRace, Rogue Squadron, and the japanese version of SSB:M. And even with 3 kids in the house i haven't even used 20 blocks yet. If you only get one card, make sure you save over previous saves (unless you want a back up). Or get that panasonic thing."
2,Better off with the 251 Block Card,You are better off with the black 251 block card. It holds moare than four times the data and is only a few measly bucks more. The 251 card is more than worth the extra money.
4,Sufficient for now,"The memory card 59 is an adequate card for now. The card has enough memory to support several games. Most games require a card to be fun. It works well and is nice and small and relatively inexpensive. However, like any other product it has its problems. One problem is it is very small card in terms of capacity. Games that need a lot of data use up most if not all the card. The space is not 4 megabytes as many beleive but 4 Mbits (1 Mbit = 1/8 MByte). So if you are able to aquire a large library of games you may want a larger card or many cards as they are inexpensive."
4,"If you have a GameCube, you need one of these!","Everything a memory card should be! It is a very important thing though, so you should buy this with your GameCube. Since it is called Memory Card 59 it has 59 slots of data. The only thing is that GameCube is not like PS1 or some other systems. All games are not 1 block..Some are up to 20 blocks...To access the memory card, when you turn on your GameCube system, hold down the A button and then the screen should pop up. This memory card does its job and I recommend it... I hope this was helpfull.Thanks,*Vapor*"
3,Nice Item with Bad Pivot Pin Design,"This expensive and hefty item is designed with a pivot pin that allows too much play in the knocker. I have bought two and both had the same problem. Something this nice should not have a sloppy pivot pin. You can improve the issue by hammering a nail punch into both ends to expand the pin, otherwise your nice knocker will have way too much sidewards play."
5,All-Clad Stainless Balloon Whisk - Excellent,This whisk is excellent; it is well made and easy to clean. I use mine all the time to beat eggs for making omelets etc. It is excellent quality that will last a lifetime. Highly recommended! A+ !
2,Not what I was Expecting,Received this whisk in a few days. I was very surprised. It is a nice heavy whisk but huge. Not what I was expecting. I should have read the description better. I'm not sure what I will use it for. I may give it to my daughter or friend.
4,Frank,Got this item and the item is made extremely well. Paint job is done very well. The bunny suit looks like a bunny suit. If I had any problems it would be like the reviewer below me said was that the voice is tough to make out and not that great. Other than that this is a great item that I recommend.
4,Frank is our Hero!!,"I ordered this for my husband for xmas. We are both immense and dedicated fans of Donnie Darko and Richard Kelly films. All in all we really like the toy and we display in our media room. It really is neat. my only con is that the audio is terrible. ridiculous in fact. you cannot understand a thing he says and background noise of the movie is mixed in making it even harder to understand Frank. I think they should have take more audible recordings of Franks' quotes. Nonetheless, this will make any Donnie Darko fan a very happy admirer of the works."
1,don't buy,i just purchased in late June 2008 and it has already failed as of Aug 8 2008. it is cheaply made and slow and leaky. very disapointed.
1,VERY BAD BAIT AND SWITCH,I bought this cheap piece of JUNK thru amazon get organized and taylor gifts which was a bait and switch the product image on the page was a hand pump for liquid containers w/ hand pump in the lid and I received a cheap piece of JUNK w/a foot pump that was no easy to use the delivery system hose was suppose to be 4ft long but there was more hose that would go into your container than the delivery hose that was only about 2ft long very BADThen someone from amazon get organized emailed me after my first review and said they would get me free return postage label which never happened so I had to pay $11.76 to insure it and send it back and still do not know if I will get my money back the way things have gone and if I do not get my credit card credited for this I will be contacting the Better Business BureauVery DissatifiedTimthy P Lundahl
3,Works well... for about a year.,"My pump, like S. Matthew's, also failed after about a year. The pump worked pretty well until then. I am purchasing a replacement, we'll see if it lasts more than a year this time."
4,Not boring,My kids and I enjoy this DVD. (They are ages 8 and 12.) Very good to help with learning sign language. Not boring.
5,for our library,"Our local library had the complete set, but someone walked off with this one so I replaced it. Excellent choice."
2,I got a better idea what you could watch instead,"Wow I must say I'm really surprised to find something like this on Amazon, though not in a good way.If you want to see a nice First World girl very well preserved by the vacuum and frost of space,the pilot of a 5 mile long space ship, from a global space-faring civilization that existed on Earthbefore the Great Flood you'll find that on u tube. It's a 90 minutedocumentary (fiction or not I'll let you decide) that explores the cute pilot, her ship and some ofthe surrounding ruins that are thought to be a space port. It's out there, it's free and it'll leaveyou wondering how much of it is true. This flick here leaves me wondering if I should try to get arefund."
1,!!!! Amazon needs to remove this from selection !!!,"No plot, no acting, twenty minutes of bad, barely there story. Amazon should delete this. This qualifies as garbage. After a few minutes, the mistake you made in ordering this hits you."
3,Odd little movie...,"but with some polish and touch-ups, this concept just might make a great movie. Personally, I think it has potential if someone good with making movies got a hold of it."
2,Was this a pilot that never made it!,The show is about 20 minutes long and set into the future. Aliens that are going to take over the Earth (I think) but the show barely has time to introduce the cast never mind have a plot that can develop at all. It's possible it would have been a good show but you'll never know with a 20 minute pilot for TV that never went anywhere. Honestly don't waste you time or money on this!
1,"Bad story, bad acting, bad ending",It doesn't get much worse than this. Ed Woods Planet 9 was at least entertaining. You should be paid to watch this.
2,Extremely Christian Science Fiction,"Devout Christians are not often known for their subtlety and this film is certainly not subtle. Like countless others it forces their scripture and morality down the audience's throat with all the finesse of a bull in a China shop. Preferring to ambush the audience rather then tease them and make a slow reveal. A nice concept, well done on the technical end for a low budget film, but about as artistic as a can of beer."
3,Be Discerning,"""But seek first the kingdom of God AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, and all these things will be added to you."" (Matt. 6:33)Just don't forget about the ""and his righteousness"" part."
1,Word of Faith Theology,"This is the second time I have had to submit a review for this book. It seems that amazon.com or followers of the WOF movement do not want critics. They do not want their doctrine to be tested with the authority of scripture. They do not want Burean like Christians. I know many have and continue to complain about me. But so the scripture is being fulfilled (2 Tim 4:2-4). For the Time will come, when Men will not Put up with Sound Doctrine, but instead to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. These scriptures are being fulfilled today in this book and in much of the church."
5,When Heaven Invades My World,"I am taking it slow on this one, on purpose. It would be so easy to just gobble up every life giving word, and sometimes that is appropriate and even necessary. In the case of Bill Johnson's When Heaven Invades Earth, however, speed is not expedient. Think medicine. Repeated intensive treatments. Long term, invasive, cell transforming, light therapy. Too dramatic? Okay. Not for me though, I mean it. If you are desperate for more light, more life, to breathe the air that Jesus breathes, Bill Johnson is the real deal, and he has something to say about that. I suppose you could really take it in at any pace too. If you'd rather gobble than savor, Mr. Johnson has made that easy work for you. I'd like to say you can, if you prefer, avoid the life changing benefits of this relatively smallish volume...but I'm not making any promises."
5,An Excellent Read....,"Bill Johnson's book is a fantastic read. It's a real faith builder and yet it isn't one of those ""pie in the sky-if you can shape up"" types of books. He uses sound revelation from the Bible and vivid examples from his own life and the lives of others to portray what is possible here on earth as we apply the Kingdom of Heaven to our situations. Mr. Johnson makes you believe that Jesus meant what he said when He prayed, ""Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.Well written. You'll enjoy it IF you're willing change your way of thinking about life on this planet."
4,Great Book!,"I must admit first I'm a Bill Johnson fan. No not like that idol worship stuff or stalker but I have been listening to his sermons on line for years and have enjoyed visiting his Church in Redding Ca. (Bethel) Anyway a great book to get your toes wet when diving into the reality of a Supernatural God and Lifestyle. Bill is a very sincere and caring man who is changing the way we view healing and the miraculous. ""A day without the miraculous is a day wasted."" This is a good read and will challenge your faith in the God of the Supernatural!"
3,When Heaven Invades Earth,"I think the author makes some good points about the condition of the church, that of displaying little power. I think it important to read this book with God and let Him show you how to walk with the power He gave you in Christ in balance with the truth of the Word. Always read anything written, including the Word, with God. Only He can open the eyes of your understanding and keep you on the right path. We need to walk like Christ to fulfill the calling God has called us to. This book adds some insight to that truth. I appreciated much of what the author said, but have reservations about some as well. There is much incorrect teaching and thinking regarding the entire holy spirit field mentioned in this book. But the urgency to pursue God to walk in the realm of the miraculous, God certainly supports. Hold to the truth and discard the rest."
2,Good but beware...,"Good game, all pieces as described. However!!! Original game was for 8-10 players; the new version is for 8 players only and has no option for 2 more. We had 10 players so it was a little awkward. One acted as narrator but would have been better with 10 players."
3,University Games Murder Mystery Party Game - Murder at Mardi Gras,"This was our first time hosting a murder mystery dinner. The game did not provide costume or character suggestions which made it hard to tell guests how to dress. It was fun after we got started and I would recommend this game to anyone who has experience with these ""events""."
2,Murder at Mardi Gras,"I found this game to confusing and, overall, not a lot of fun. It was not easy to come up with dialogue while playing. Basically it was everyone sitting in a circle and reading a script. That is not what I was looking for when I found this game."
5,Great Game...,"I have done other mysteries in the past and had a good time, this one was a GREAT time! 8 active players and we had ""Guests"" that just dressed as though they were going to Mardi Gras =)"
5,Excellent 1950's Mystery,"This is my first Helen McCloy/Basil Willing mystery, but I hope it won't be my last.A reclusive author, Amos Cottle, is poisoned at a party given by his publisher. Who did it - his grasping actress wife, the critic who disparages his books, the critic who lauds his books, the publisher's wife with whom he was having an affair, the small-time agent who depends on Cottle's bestsellers for most of his income? The mystery becomes even deeper when it is discovered that 'Amos Cottle' was not the victim's real name. So who was he really?Plenty of suspects in this very well-written classic mystery, with the added bonus of an inside look into the world of authors, agents and publishers.If you are a fan of the Frances and Richard Lockridge 'Mr. and Mrs. North' mysteries, you will like this book. Highly recommended."
5,Super Comfortable and Durable,"I have had this for years now, and it's awesome. It's my favorite pasta ladle, is very comfortable to hold, and easy to keep clean."
1,Terrible customer service for a terrible product,"This product failed after 1 year of very light use. I would have simply purchased whatever replacement part it needed however Zareba's ""customer service"" was so bad that they wouldn't even help me diagnose the issue. They couldn't answer simple questions and just blamed our installation which, by the way, worked perfectly for the year that it was operational. My husband and I both called on several different occasions and everybody that we spoke with was completely useless. I am sure the product could have easily been troubleshooted over the phone and repaired with a simple replacement part however I decided to invest in a new charger from Gallagher who stands behind their product with a two year warrantly and excellent service."
4,2-year experience,"I bought one of these two years ago. After almost 1 year of daily use, the unit stopped functioning. Zareba repaired the unit in a few weeks, and I have been using that unit since with no trouble. Seems to me that I paid a good price for something that has lasted and a company who has stood behind its product.I am amazed that despite gray winter months, I have not found the battery to be depleted or the fence to be unpowered. One improvement I desire is a stronger power level equivalent to the 12V chargers that Zareba makes. This one isn't as effective when the ground gets dry and the goats get a little brave."
5,Waited so long for this CD/Absolutely worth it!!!!!!!,"This CD has been a long time coming.If it were possible to wear out a CD I would have worn out his previous one ""What you don't know"" by now.The three songs we were allowed to listen to were absolutely AWESOME!!!!!!! And he ain't bad to look at either."
4,Liked is mostly,"This album starts off great. They have a really good irish-punk kind of sound happening at first. Then it turns more into less irishy punk. I hate to use the word punk because I don't want to draw connotations of lame pop-punk bands. This is a very good album. The only thing negative I have to say, hence the 4 stars, is that towards the end of the album the songs get a little redundant. They start to sound the same a little bit. I would, however, reccomend this album. It probably got about 5 or so play-throughs in my CD player before it was replaced."
3,Cool timbres,"I heard a song by these guys on Weeds and thought I'd give them a try. There are many interesting things in their music, but it doesn't really come together as it might. Give their Johnny Cash EP a try instead."
3,OK manual but not Chilton quality,"This is an OK manual but there are a lot of grouping of procedures. The headlight adjustment for example was shown for my Altima does not have the adjustments that are shown in the book. Illustrations are vague. When performing a procedure, you are directed to several different locations in the manual to remove other items that may or may not need to be removed to accomplish the task. This is a good manual for the do-it-yourselfer but not for a competent back-yard mechanic and this manual would not be found in an everyday mechanics collection. Troubleshooting and torque specs information are a plus though. I would choose a Chilton's manual over this if I had to buy again."
1,not good any more,Haynes used to do a good job ... years agothis manual does not even tell one how to remove the relay box in the engine compartment... the main thing I bought the book for ... ended up telling the customer to take his car to the dealer. I sent Haynes and email.No response.ridiculous
4,Nissan Altima Repair Manual,I bought this book because I had a problem with the fan not working on low & med. The book was fairly easy to follow and I was able to locate the problem and how to fix it. The book is easy to understand and very helpful. I was able to make several repairs myself without having to take my car to the mechanic and spending a lot of money on something that I could do myself.
3,"Good ball, Horrible pump",Ball is in great shape. The hand air pumper is VERY CHEAP and will take at least 2hrs to pump air into. Luckily I have an electric pump....
3,"Not Kylies best, but a good CD",This was a good CD but is mostly songs from the fist half of Kylie's musical life. Good if you don't have some of her early work but not if you have many of her CD's.
2,No nutritional Information?,"The book receuived such kudos that I was compelled to purchase it.With all of the buzz about whole grains, different grains, grains high in protein, etc I wanted to learn about these grains!I could not tell you if Millet has any more protein, vitamins, or minerals than Barley, Grits, or Kamut. I could, however, give you some historical information on the grain, and tell you a little about the variations of rice.And that information is interesting.BUT, when looking for a Spendid book on grains, I just assumed there would be some nutritional information.I am disappointed."
2,All Purpose Flour??!!!,"[...]. Both the one for ""fried chicken"" and the one for ""buckwheat muffins"" featured large amounts of regular old all purpose WHITE flour. I'm not looking for a book on whole grains to get more recipes with white flour, thanks anyway. I suppose if you are just interested in exploring new grain varieties it might be mildly interesting."
1,Not a local food choice,"I bought this book because of the rave reviews found on Amazon.I was so disappointed when I got it. In an age where people need to get to local food rather than shipped food, this book is not the one to get. Its recipes require exotic ingredients grown in different parts of the world at different seasons.I found none of the receipes usuable for my local food needs and, indeed, my eating out of my garden needs. This book, for me, was a complete waste of money! It is a good buy for the upper income eschelons though, but for most of us, it is obsolete in an age of shipped food being too expensive to buy."
2,Not that many practical recipes,"I ordered this book because other reviews spoke about the thorough descriptions of the grain and basic cooking instructions which I wanted. While those were great, there were very few recipes, and it only covered like 8 grains. Most of the recipes were too involved for everyday cooking and didn't preserve the original grain - i.e. a lot of them you ground up grains for flour. There were also only 3 quinoa recipes which was really disappointing."
3,Nice history and info on grains,"I found this book to be somewhat of a disappointment; it wasn't bad, just not very useful. There was a lot of history on the different grains I found interesting and pragmatically it lacked substance (no pun intended). I just couldn't use any of the recipes that were included. Maybe you can, but you have been warned."
2,Better Alternatives,"These boots have zero insoles whatsoever which make them extremely uncomfortable. Literally they are one step above a rubber rain slicker. I paid $24 for the boots, $5 for shipping, and another $8 for insoles with arche supports. They are not worth the asking price as I have seen better boots selling locally for $25-30. I give them 2 stars because they are warm, and waterproof."
5,True Grits is the most interesting cookbook that has ever come my way.,"The book itself was of very good quality and it arrived quickly. It is a wonderful picture of the cuisine and customs of the South, the presentation is wonderful, and I love the stories especially. Plus it has the best recipe for Keylime Cheesecake I have ever tasted!"
5,You too can make a gourmet meal!,"With amazing recipes from some of Atlanta's premier chefs, this book makes it easy to prepare a gourmet meal that will WOW your dinner guests. Not only does it make gourmet cooking fun and easy, it is a beautiful addition to your cookbook collection. It is the perfect gift for weddings, Mother's day, Christmas, birthdays, house warming, etc."
3,Coca Cola Recipe IS wrong!,"The first recipe I tried from this book was the ""controversial"" Coca Cola Cake-& it was indeed a flop! In researching other versions of this recipe I found that for the icing, this recipe calls for 3/4 cup of cola whereas most others call for approx. 3 tablespoons! No wonder mine looked lake a ""floating isle""! Now I'm not sure I trust the other recipes!"
2,not as picture shows,It is a great protein powder however while the picture shows that it is contained in a bucket that is easy to be moved it showed up in a bag which is annoying.
5,"Captures the essence of this proud, passionate, and pious woman","Confronted By God: The Essential Verna Dozier by co-editors Cynthia L. Shattuck & Fredrica Harris Thompsett is a carefully selected assembly of the writings of Verna Dozier, a Christian African-American woman dedicated to speaking out for the sake of the poor, dedicating herself to spreading the idea of equality as God's great dream. Confronted By God captures the essence of this proud, passionate, and pious woman, and invokes both compassion and contemplation at length in the reader. ""Has anyone called you a fanatic lately? And if they did, was it because you were so set on establishing a morality for someone else, or because you were intent on a private piety, or because you were willing to risk every known security that someone else might have a richer life?"""
4,Confronted by Verna,"One of the most plainspoken yet rigorously intelligent books I have read on religion in quite a while. Ms. Dozier's call to action for lay people to take hold of their faith would put off most Sunday-only Christians, but for those of us seriously engaged in religion she provides a strong push to move forward. This book provides a good introduction to the lady's thoughts and should motivate the reader to want more."
2,Shoddy Workmanship,"Just got the fork, and it looked good at first. Sturdy. Stainless steel. The design is good. Not much curvature in the tines, but usable. Then I noticed that the tines were not sharp, even a little. I looked closer at the tines. The tips had been ground off flat with an electric grinder. There were heat discolorations at the tips from the rough grinding operation. It's not usable as received. It would be like trying to pierce meat with a flat punch or a screw driver.The tines are different sizes. One is larger than the other: an eighth of an inch longer and about a sixteenth of an inch wider. The outside surfaces are polished, but the inside surfaces of the tines are rough, as though from casting. The roughness and the flat tips would tear the meat, not penetrate smoothly.This shows very bad QC. Not what I expected from All-Clad, even if it is made in China. I may just use a file and a stone on it to make it usable. Or maybe just send it back. Probably the latter."
1,check the review dates before you buy,"I sent it back. Something has changed since the glowing reviews of earlier years and the unhappy now. All-Clad used to be wonderful stuff. Now it seems there's a big change in quality. This fork has rough places, it's not smooth and perfect. And it's not nice-looking. No deal! I'll keep my well-made 40 year old cheap one with the pink plastic handle. The All-Clad stainless steel was meant to be a long-overdue upgrade. But I can't live with something so strange-looking, the tines too huge, the handle bulky and hulky in my hand. What really made me send it back instantly, however, was the fact that it would not stick to my magnetic strip for hanging utensils above the counter. Just be warned--apparently not all ""stainless steel"" will stick to a magnet. And apparently, not all All-Clad is beautifully designed anymore."
5,quality fork,"Needed a new fork, as the one I have now is very wimpy. This fork is a beautifully crafted tool. It is nice and strong, can deal with a turkey or large roast. In the future I may get another one."
5,A goood home town story of struggle for life.,Since I live in Memphis I was around when this happened and could not believe what had taken place. Also the book gives a background on the pilots and tells a lot of what was not found out by the average person just by watching the news and finding out through the grapevine. I enjoyed this bokk because it keept you glued to the book and wanting to know what happens next. I hope more of you will take the oppertuity to try this book and enjoy it for its true and good story.
1,terrible,"Absolutely the worst condition I could have imagined, dirty, faded, pages turned down. I absolutely will not order from this seller again. I am disappointed in Amazon for letting someone like this on their website.Kerry Duckett"
4,Good read,Really enjoyed this one as much as the first one ready for the next one as soon as I can get it off Amazon for Kindle free.
4,Good Read,"Book was enjoyable, kept me so attached I couldn't let go. The book is suspenseful, you think maybe its this, then you change your mind to another, then switch back again. The book is full of surprises. I did however think the story ended a bit too abruptly. Good ending mind you, but just too...quick. Still, a good book. I'd read it again."
5,Will have to read #1 now!,"This was a very good read with a lot of heart. The topic was disturbing, and made me want to know more. I will keep up with this series."
4,Very Good Book,"I enjoyed this book, it kept me interested to the end. one of those that you cant wait to see what happens next so you just keep reading. I gave it four stars rather than five because it had too many uses of ""the f word"" for my taste. I dont see that profanity adds anything to the story and prefer it to be left out."
4,Cross current,"Fun reads, the Seychelles Sullivan series look forward to the next one . Can relate to the Floridian way of life."
3,A good story.,"The author,s Knowledge of boats adds a realistic flavor to the excitement. She,as good story teller. A little more character development would be good."
3,Brings back old Florida,"I've lived in Florida all my life and the descriptions of backwater canals, waterfront bars and eateries brought back memories. I was ready to give this book four stars, but kept getting bogged down in the nautical descriptions. I found myself skimming a lot in order to get to the real story. There was too much superfluous background thrown in, too. I found it annoying that the heroine kept putting herself in danger instead of leaving it to the police. It is noted that human trafficking is a real problem, not only in Florida, but throughout the United States."
4,great read,"This was a great read, kept my mind going, lots of twists, and I am looking forward to the next one soon."
4,Good read,I enjoyed the back story of this book as much as the mystery. The getaway was far-fetched but what you might expect for the genre.
4,Sey does it again,Such good characters. I enjoyed how the story unfolded. I can't wait to see what Seychelle gets herself into next.
4,Cross Current,I liked it very much. It keeps you going and you don't want to put it down until you finish it.
4,Cross Current,Well written. Had a lot of sailing and boating detail. Character development was strong. I also enjoyed the setting descriptions.
4,I don't.....,"Know a thing about Haiti, voodoo or boats. But the heart in this story warmed the cockles of my heart."
5,All-Clad Stainless 5 Qt Colander,This colander is great and meets all my needs. I love having a large colander for many applications. It is so beautiful I have it displayed on the wall of my kitchen.
3,COLANDER,"The quality of the colander is excellent. However, the holes in the colander are too large. When draining noodles, they tend to come out the holes."
3,All Clad Colander,"The quality of this colander is what you would expect from All Clad. However, a very important factor in my decision to purchase All Clad products is the fact that they are made in the USA. This colander is made in China."
2,Stains Easily,"For the price I expected better quality. While it feels sturdy and looks great right out of the box, it stained immediately the first time I used and it was only to drain garbanzo beans. It has since only gotten worse as I've used it to drain pasta and rinse salad. I've tried to clean it with various different cleaners and nothing works."
5,awsome!,"This is such a great colander- I was worried about it being too small to really help me in the kitchen, but its perfect! Its built to last, very sturdy, great product- thinking about giving it as a gift. Highly recommend!!"
4,Great product,I love my all clad colander! I like the large holes. It makes it easy to strain the liquid. The only thing that I dislike about it that it is a bit heavy.
4,its nice,"This colander is well made, very easy to clean. But. The holes on the top are much larger than on the bottom, so if you try to tilt the colander, the stuff pours out through the holes..... so on smaller pasta and rice this colander is not usable... otherwise, I like it"
3,Fish turner from All Clad,"Beautiful to look at and high quality from All Clad are good reasns to buy this item. But, another purchaser wrote it was uncomfortable to use and that's right. I thought it didn't matter so I bought it. It isn't just uncomfortable, it feels terrible in your hand even if you are only using it for a few seconds. However it does the job and it isn't expensive."
3,Need to cook more fish,"This is just one of those kitchen tools that you rarely use, but when you need to use it, having it there makes things 10x easier. It's sort of like a potato masher, pineapple shaver, melon baller, or other item that is very, very specialized.If you cook whole, large fish daily, then having this is really nice. The build quality is high, just like all All Clad tools made in China.However, if you rarely cook fish, then buying a set of All Clad tongs is 100x more useful. You can use 2 spatulas and ask for help if you need to flip or serve a large fish.Out of all my All Clad utensils I have to say this fish turner and the All Clad skimmer are the least used. You need to improvise and find other uses for this and treat it like a large spatula - omelets, roasts, pancakes, etc., but once again a pan toss or tongs would also do the job and probably do the job better."
2,tricky advertising,"if you are expecting these bulbs to have a bluish (6500k) look to them, you will be let down. these have the same tint and brightness as the standard stock bulbs for my car... very disappointing. the glass is indeed blue, but the gas is mainly what gives the color... they have no tint."
1,Oh my....,"Oh my goodness...I don't think I have seen a worse film in all my years. I am a huge fan of Brad Renfro and thought, ""Hey, why don't I add another one of his DVDs to my collection, since he is a really good actor so I know none of his movies could be bad, at least in my mind because just him being in the movie is an automatic 3 stars."" Boy, was I wrong! I couldn't even watch this. I had to keep pausing it and returning back. It was just horrible. I bought it used and wish I could take it back...that was 15 dollars shot out of my pocket. I don't recommend viewing this due to the complete torture of boredom. But I think you should watch this if you hope to become a screen writer on what NOT to write. If they can make movies like this I have a bunch of scripts I think they should put together than would be block buster hits compared to this film. Just absolutely horrible. Not to mention, Brad Renfro was only in like 3 scenes with like 2 lines. Just horrible. Completely horrible."
4,Almost overly ambitious,"Eclectic triumph may be too concerned expanding the confines of Jazz guitar with stringed arrangements to be Metheny's ultimate conceptual trip, but remains a uniquely epic piece of work definitely worth owning."
5,A worthwhile NEEDLE in the haystack if found,"This is some of Pat Methany's best work especially ""The Truth Will Always Be"". It is very hard to find because it is out of print."
4,"Not bad, but not his best in my opinion, though","Though I wouldn't remotely qualify the album as bad (I have a hard time thinking of any bad works Metheny has come up with), I can't qualify it as his best either. First of all, to the person accostumed to that 'intimate' sound of his guitar along with his band or one/two other musicians, there's a lot more going on in this one than 'just' Metheny along with Lyle Mays, Aznar, Vasconcelos or the legendary Charlie Haden. You got members of the Londong Orchestra in there too...To be honest, my first listen to this album was a real shock. I've processed it a couple more times now, and some of the tracks begin to sink in by now, but I still can't get off the feel that it's not Metheny's best. For that, go to 'As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls', 'Letter From Home' or even his most recent, 'One Quiet Night' (though bitterly questioned by some of his more hardcore fans)."
1,Shopping center music,"One of my friend recommanded to me this album, as an introduction to Pat Metheny's music. He said it was a masterpiece, it seems that we don't have the same taste for music. I am not telling that he is wrong or that I am right, I just want to say that for me, this album is a shopping center music, the kind you heard in a Wal Mart. I am a music lover, I can appreciate almost anything but not this, I didn't experience any feeling or emotion while listening to it. As always, almost every rating here comes from fans of the artist, well, I am not and this just make a good balance to the whole thing. Thanks for reading."
4,Good music.,"This is the only Pat Metheny work that I have heard. Hearing 'above the treetops' was enough for me to buy the cd plus it was recommended by people.I was not disappointed. Not at all. Its great music. I think 'the truth will always be' is the best of the lot. The last 3 minutes of that song do it for me. Of course, the vocals on 'above the treetops'(if you want to call that vocals) is superb. That one is really calming. 'the longest summer' is also great.The music is soft and soothing. I could let it run and work and it would not invade but would just merge. The music has a very settling feeling about it. Somehow it clears my head."
4,Very interesting,"This book read, in part, like a novel with good guys (nature's prey) and the bad guys (the predators)...it was a gruesome, at times, but realistic book about survival. I enjoyed it very much."
3,not as functional as i had hoped,"Bought this because i didn't want to be eating plastic. However, there is no ""give"" to this turner and everything gets stuck in the holes which are difficult to clean. The holes aren't Emeril's fault, of course, but I was naive to think the oil would fall through them. Whatever does is minimal that you're better off getting the solid turner."
5,Highly Recommended,"Browne does a great job of explaining the problems of our expanding government. Problems include medicare, social security, welfare, the war on drugs, high taxes, and defense spending. All these programs are flawed or they aren't worth the amount of funds that are going into the program. Its interesting to see that the Democrats and Republicans really don't have too many differences except for increasing the budget with wasteful spending. Browne's ideas are fascinating, but its a shame that the media won't give him a chance to express his views."
2,I should have listened to more cuts!,"As a product of the 70's, I was anxious to create a library of my favorite singers and groups. The cuts ""Hummingbird"" and ""Summerbreeze"" are sheer joys. They are wonderful and come across well on today's digital equipment. The remainder of the ""album"" left me cold. Yes, several of the songs are direct references to the artists' religion, which didn't bother me as much as the poor harmonies and tinny sound. Overall, the album seemed disjointed and not as harmonious as the voices can be."
2,Mostly filler material,"Beware that this album contains very few actual charted hits & mostly what I suppose are album cuts. I am so tired of seeing this kind of practice from the record companies. Greatest hits should mean just that-greatest hits! The record companies scream when they think they are being duped or cheated by the public but seem to think it is fine for them to do the same thing, I will never understand this."
5,Received,"Dear Sirs,I received in good order and condition the music ordered below today the 7th Jan.2011.Thank you and regards,Henri Richard"
3,4 out of 10,"There are only four songs on this CD, out of ten songs on it, that were major hits, and deservedly so, but I am hard pressed to buy any CD containing only four gems out of ten mediocre songs. The fours songs, of course, being Summer Breeze, We May Never Pass This Way (Again), I'll Play For You, and Diamond Girl, are excellent classic songs, but like so many of the bands who have legendary hits but receive minimum radio play, their greatest hits collections too often fall short when most of them have maybe three or four great songs mixed in with too many bland songs that for good reason were never really hits."
4,Seals & Crofts- Spiritual Enlightenment,"Having listened to this music when it was released in the 70's, I was amazed when I heard it again for the ""1st"" time! This music was obviously written by highly evolved spiritual beings. It is so beautiful and inspiring."
4,What about the rest?,"This is fine for what it is, but if America gets a boxed set, can we at least have a complete greatest hits for Seals and Crofts? There are major hits missing, as well as so many great album cuts."
1,Pointless and disgraceful,"Why is Warner re-releasing a 32-year-old, 40-minute Seals & Crofts ""Greatest Hits"" album that still doesn't contain ""Get Closer"" and ""You're the Love,"" both of which were Top 20 hits? It was obsolete when it was first released on CD in 1987, and Warner hasn't spent a nickel to improve it in the 20 years since."
4,I'm wanting more!!!,"There is no question that every track on this CD is excellent - some of the duo's ""early"" best! But, what about their later material. Yes, this is the original LP. However, in this day and age of expanded CDs with extra added bonus cuts, this CD should have contained later material also - say a ""Greatest Hits & More"" or a ""Greatest Hits (Expanded Edition)."" That is why I give this CD only four stars. The music, of course, gets five stars. After reading other Amazon.com reviews, I see I'm not the only one who is wanting more Seals & Crofts on CD. Another LP that should be available on CD is their 1976 masterpiece ""Get Closer."" That title track along with other classic tunes should have been included on the CD edition of the Greatest Hits. Where are these other great hits from 1976 on: Baby I'll Give It To You, My Fair Share, Takin' It Easy, You're The Love... and the list could go on. We want more!!!"
3,Their best work is their first album,"If you've only heard their commercial successes, you've missed the best. So often, a band's first album(s) is their best work. There are two types of artists: 1) those whose non-hits are too inaccessible for all but a dedicated few to appreciate, and 2) those whose non-hits are really good, but just not quite ""pop"" enough or marketed well. S&C are the latter. Their first album ""I & II"" is actually the first major release of the first two albums they did. The sound is the same as their later work, but has more ""meat"" than the pop hits. Its probably more recognizable bluegrass, part of which reflects their religion, part doesn't. They might have lasted on the scene a little longer if they hadn't spent most of their concerts trying to convert the audience to B'Hai (their faith). The I & II double album may only be out on vinyl, possibly cassette. I can listen to their pop hits now and then, but I could listen to the I & II albums every week."
2,70's MOR - Incomplete,"Sort of a poor man's Simon and Garfunkel, Seals and Crofts had a string of pleasant, if rarely profound, MOR hit singles during the 1970's. This collection has most of the hits, but ironically is missing the duo's biggest one ""Get Closer."" Granted this collection was first released on vinyl in 1975, one year before ""Get Closer"" hit the charts, but by the time this was issued on CD there was absolutely no reason why it could not have been expanded and updated. Blame sloppy work from Warner Brothers for this oversight. Two and a half stars"
5,Beautiful music,"Purchased this to replace an LP from ""my youth"" (ha ha). Music just as beautiful as I remembered."
4,"Good, but incomplete","This CD is simply a re-issue of their mid-70s Greatest Hits album. It only has 10 songs, like the original vinyl album had, and does not include their later hits like Closer To You. It is a shame that very little of this duo's work is available on CD. It is long past time for Rhino to come to the rescue and issue a Seals & Crofts Complete Greatest Hits CD with 20+ songs on it. Their music warrants it and their fans deserve it!!!!"
5,Seal & Croft Greatest Hits,"Revisiting this music 40 yrs later is very, very enlightening! Understanding Hummingbird validates the attraction to this music years ago."
3,Esperaba mejores canciones,"Debido a que solo habia escuchado Summer Breeze en la radio decidi comprar este CD sin importar el resto de las canciones. Pense que quienes cantaran Summer Breeze tendrian algo mas que ofrecer... No fue asi. Lo recomiendo solo para aquellos debotos de la religion BAHAI. Encontraran quizas tres canciones mas que son dignas de recordar, el resto mejor olvidar."
3,Pleasant,"In 1971-73, Seals & Crofts were a nice counterweight to some of the top acts of the day (Grand Funk, Alice Cooper, etc.), but like so many of the ""soft-rock"" crowd of that time, their stuff seems even more lightweight now than when it first came out, and that's saying one heaping mouthful! I still find ""Summer Breeze"" pleasant to listen to when it comes on the radio and ""We May Never Pass This Way Again"" certainly brings back a few high school yearbook-type lumps in the throat, but I never am inclined to play anything of theirs from a ""gotta hear some Seals & Crofts"" perspective, unlike many of the other musical groups I grew up with. They were just part of the aural landscape of the time, as much musical wallpaper as were John Denver, Helen Reddy, Chicago, Anne Murray and Gilbert O'Sullivan. If that's your meat and potatos, than buy this album; it's everything Seals & Crofts were in one central place."
3,Not the ideal collection anymore.,"A good collection, marred by the absence of ""Get Closer,"" a big hit for them the year after this collection came out. I bet there's another Seals and Crofts collection that remedies that unfortunate omission."
2,Should have been more inside!,"Now don't get me wrong, Seals & Crofts are great song writers and musician but the record company fell asleep on this one. There are so many tunes not on here that truely should be, this is what happenes when record companies get greedy and some cat in a suit who does not know the music makes the decision to put out a greatest hits Cd. Jim and Dash are great guys and I know first hand, I grew up jamming with them at San Fernando park in the San Fernando Valley. A certain song is truely missing here ""Cause You Love"", no I wont tell you what album its from you need to look it up and buy that album or Cd. Too bad that some record companies do this kind of thing?"
4,Well-crafted songs of timeless appeal,"Three songs on this 10-track CD were Top 10 hits in about 1973 for American folkies Seals & Crofts : Diamond Girl, We May Never Pass this Way Again and their signature tune : Summer Breeze. These are well-crafted songs of timeless appeal that I still play sometimes on my CD player. The other songs are pretty good too.I really do like this CD, particularly the song We May Never Pass This Way Again. Recommended to those who enjoy good tunecraft."
5,I love Seals & Crofts!,"This is a very enjoyable disc and Seals & Crofts were a very good duo and underrated. The only complaint I would have with this disc, is that it's not comprehensive enough, there really should be a more thorough greatest hits of Seals & Crofts, they deserve that much. Otherwise, the disc itself contains all great songs, good sound quality. I'd love to see a Seals & Crofts anthology, someday!"
1,cd skips,I sent the cd back and I am waiting for a refund or the cd replaced . As of this time I have not recieved neather.East 2 West cds told me that they were sorry that they cut it with a knife. I asked them why they sent it if they knew that it got cut and they have not answered me back. I just want the cd replaced or my money refunded. Please.
4,Great album - with one glaring omission!,"This album features some of the duo's true gems. Included are such rarely-heard tracks as ""When I Meet Them,"" ""Ruby Jean and Billie Lee"" and ""East of Ginger Trees,"" along with the group's staples (""Summer Breeze,"" ""We May Never Pass This Way Again,"" among others). My one problem with the album is that it doesn't contain ""Get Closer."" ""Get Closer"" is equal in quality to all of the songs that are featured on the album. How did the producers miss that one? Just the same, this is a great album that belongs on the shelf of anybody who is interested in 1970s soft rock."
1,Shame!,"I waited eagerly for my ""new"" Seals & Crofts Greatest Hits. Okay, so it wasn't expanded (their catalog is deserving of more than a 10 song, 39 minute CD) but it wasn't remastered either! I am so disappointed. This was a complete waste of money, because I already have the 1990 CD! Shame on Rhino and Warner and whoever else is responsible for this ripoff!C. Tusten Houchin"
2,Seals & Crofts Greatest Hits,"Cd purports to be their ""Greatest Hits"" but does not include ""Get Closer"" which charted on the Billboard Charts at #6, which is their greatest hit."
5,Lovely!,"Got the shawl in a dark rose shade & very pleased with the look & feel of it, quite lovely for dress up, as well as slacks. Price is great too!"
3,"Medium quality, returned due to flaw","I have returned my scarf because there was a flaw in the weave. Looked like a pencil had been run through the weave and this hole was noticeable. When I looked more carefully I found one single white thread elsewhere. Was this scarf a second?Before seeing these I tried it on and was pleased. Yes, this will do nicely, I thought at first. Silk? No, I don't think so. But it would have been worth the price if not flawed."
2,Disapointed,"I purchased this for a dear friend who is very special to me. It really does not live up to it's picture as far as quality. Also, I was trying to get something unique which is why I went online, now I see the same shawls in drugstores for the same price. Sure not anything special."
5,Fast shipping! Great as gifts!,"Love all the colors, especially the green. Wow. Giving one as a gift to my boyfriend's mother, and the other as a gift to myself, perhaps? These scarves sell in the big-box stores and boutiques for at least twice the price! Save some money and buy yours here. You can get 2 here for the price of a store-bought one."
2,Has issues,Came in a plastic bag and was full of snags would not recommend to anyone. The color was pretty but other than that it was a waste of money.
4,Beautiful!,"I purchased this in burgundy for my mother because it will function as an excellent scarf to go with her winter coat. Although it is a little on the thin side, it is very soft and the pattern is gorgeous. The color is a little more purple than what was depicted on the computer screen."
3,Not great!,"From the pictures, I thought these Pashmina shawls looked beautiful. i assumed they were 75% pashmina, which is cashmere from the neck of the goat, and 25% silk. There is no label on them that indicates what the fabric actually is. It was hard to believe that after wearing one for a few hours at a function, there was a run going across on end. If this was really cashmere, it wouldn't have happened. Sorry I purchased them."
4,Beautiful,"I have been searching everywhere for wraps for the girls in my wedding to wear. One night I happened to come across the 70% pashmina & 30% silk from Saka's. I decided to order them in black to see what they would look like b/c the internet can sometimes be deceiving. When I received them in the mail, I couldn't be more excited. They are perfect for the wedding. Soft and silky feel with a very subtle design. Not only are they dressy enough for the wedding, the girls can use them again for anything. I plan on buying more, there are a ton of colors offered. Did I mention how reasonable the price was?? Also, the handwritten note with the package was a nice touch. Thank you!!"
1,NOT a Pashmina,"The scarf is nice but is falsely advertised as a Pashmina..It came with the tag sewn on stating: ""55% acrylic 45% viscose, Made in China. The description stated silk and wool. NOT."
2,Deceptive Labeling,"The shawl is advertised as 70% pashmina and 30% silk. It arrived in a clear plastic bag which indicated the same content. The shawl has a sewn in label that says 55% acrylic and 45% viscose, ""made in China"". Very thin material."
1,SCAM! Made in China from very cheap synthetic fabric.,"This shawl is made in China from very cheap synthetic fabric. We ordered one and the label read ""Acrylic 55% and Viscose 45%."" It was not Pashmina [a type of Cashmere] or silk. It felt terrible to the touch. So we sent it back and ordered again, and clearly explained to them that we will not accept anything less than Cashmere and Silk. We received the new shawls, and a cheap label ""Pashmina and Silk Blend"" was glued to the fabric... but it's the same fabric as before. They just changed the label. Give me a break. We returned it for a refund, no other choice. Cashmere and Silk are natural fibers. Viscose is made of cellulose, which comes from wood. My wife can tell the difference! Maybe at one time this item was made of Pashmina and Silk but NOT ANY MORE. THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING. As a company, Sakas Pashmina is a liar and a thief. Amazon needs to find a way to police this type of fraud."
4,One was nicer than the other,"I bought two of these as Christmas gifts. One was definitely nicer than the other. The blue one just doesn't have the same elegance as the golden/maroon colored one. I plan to keep the blue one and not give it out as a gift, it's just not special enough to be gifted."
4,Great wrap for the price,"I ordered this wrap to wear for a summer wedding. It was nice and light and the color matched what I saw on the screen pretty closely. The description says there is a paisley pattern in the weave. I ordered the solid color and there is a slight texture, but it is too subtle to make out the paisley - and that is fine for me. All in all, I was pleased with the purchase. The fabric does feel like a synthetic. I don't know what pashmina should feel like, but it doesn't seem like a 30% silk blend. Again, still a good deal for the price. I will wear this again. It is a nice weight and looks great."
4,Great Pashmina,Bought the Beige Pashmina. Feels soft and looks very elegant. Goes well with evening wear.
1,the color is not what I expected,The color is a very bright magenta instead of the reddish-purple that I was expecting.
5,So pretty!,"Soft, and the red is a very bright red. Very nice for the holidays. It is warm and can be worn as a scarf or a shawl. I recieve many compliments on this scarf."
5,Lovely quality,"I bought these as elegant but inexpensive Christmas gifts for my adult nieces, whom I am close to, but for budgetary reasons, don't generally exchange gifts with. When I saw the quality involved, I felt proud to send them. They also like them quite well. The wide variety of available colors allowed me to work with their skin tones and, since both have long hair, also to think what would look pretty against their hair. The service was quick."
2,color not what I thought,"The wrap was the perfect weight for spring, but the color was awful! I ordered sandy brown, expecting a light brown. The actual color was a burnt orange. Sent it back."
5,Pretty Shawl,"I purchased this shawl for a wedding last minute. Thanks to amazon prime I was able to receive it within 2 days. The quality of the shawl is very good. And for the price, it's a good value. I saw similar shawls at the mall for $25+tax so this purchase was a good decision!"
1,Not Pashmina!,This is Not a pashmina wrap. This is a very cheeply made wrap. Not worth the money! Do not bother.
1,"Beautiful scarf, but die bleed on white sweater","I purchased about 6 scarves from this seller in different designs as Christmas gifts. All beautiful, but the die on this one bleed onto the recipient's white sweater. Embarassing for me. Have not noticed problems with the other scarves... yet."
1,Did not like,I felt the quality of this shawl was not good. It just looked really cheap and was very thin. I was not happy with it at all and would not recommend it to anyone.
3,"Pretty, but definitely not luxe",The eggplant shawl is a pretty color and the texture is nice enough. Absolutely worth the $14 I paid for it...but not a dollar more!
2,Silk?????,"not a great feel, was a gift and i am not happy, so i will keep it and prolly no wear it but use it as a dresser scarf, now to shop for my friend. don't let the pic fool you."
4,A Beautiful Shawl with a Small Price,"I ordered two of these shawls, one in turquoise for me and one in purple for my daughter. The colors are stunning! My daughter just adores hers and was thrilled to receive it. My shawl is a real head-turner. While it is no substitute for a sweater in the winter, it does provide a little extra warmth and is stylish as well. Shawls made of pashmina cashmere wool can run $70 or more so this ""pashmina"" shawl provides the look for those on a budget."
3,"beautiful, but very thin","The shawl is beautiful, but much thinner that I anticipated. If you are looking for something warm, this is not for you. For the price, you can probably get something of better quality."
5,"Nice colors, soft and nice","I bought three of these shawls in different colors, and they all look very nice. I cannot speak of their durability as I have not worn them yet, but they will come in handy with many of my outfits. They are very soft as well."
3,dosent feel right,"very nice shawl, looks just like advertised, dosent feel right tho, this is the second pashmina i have bought, the first one is much heavyer,thicker and softer than this one. this one feels more like some kind of acrilic blend. i like it tho and since i only paid $10 for it im gonna wear it anyway."
5,Pashmina Shawl,This shawl was the perfect accessory for my dress. The actual color was just about as it appeared on screen and it arrived quickly. A great buy!
5,"Good quality, beautiful colors.","I bought these scarves for my wife and she loves them, a nice colorful accessory for her outfits, and a great value."
2,2 stars for the wrapping 4 for the scarf,"This is quite a lovely scarf. I had ordered it for my mother, gift wrapped and mistakenly had it sent to my address instead of hers. I'm glad I did. Out of curiosity I unwrapped it. The gift card was terrible. Looked like the printer ink had smeared all over the card but you could read what it said. The box itself is plain and the gold ribbon is alright. When I opened the box packing paper was staring me in the face. The scarf was wadded up in packing paper....well maybe not packing paper. Looked more like cream colored butcher paper. Very tacky. But the scarf itself was very pretty. I'm keeping it. I'll get Mom another one and wrap it myself. She'd look better in an aqua or turquoise anyway...yup."
4,Pashmina,I bought exactly the same 3 for gifts. The color is identical to the color displayed on the website and the quality as described. The friends i gave them to love them!
3,Thin Shawl,"The shawls are beautiful, nice and soft but rather thin. They look good but do not keep the chill out."
3,Five bucks on the streets of NYC,"I liked the color and feel of this shawl when I received it, though it was a tad thin for my liking. I was so proud of my purchase and for getting what I thought was a good bargain, until I went to New York recently and found the very same kind of shawl for five dollars apiece. I wish I could say that it is not the very same thing--but it is. Nevertheless, it would be a bargain for one who cannot get the shawl elsewhere. Enjoy it, ladies--it is a good accessory."
3,beautiful but totally different than the picture,"Quality of material is nice. However, my wife's color selection was based on the picture provided (blue/green paisley) which looks different than what was actually received."
1,way overpriced,"I expected more. Not worth the money. If it would be solid color it may look better, but this color combination and this fabric looks/feels cheap."
5,Good for just about everything,"I've used a couple of other grill pans from other manufacturers and was never very impressed. But I decided to give it one more try with the All-Clad. What a difference. Everything I've made from fish to vegetables, soy burgers, steaks - everything, has come out great. I've also found that it cleans up easily after a quick soaking. I don't use any spray and only oiled it as per the instructions the first time I used it. Northing sticks. Overall, a great pan I use several times a week."
5,Great grill pan!,"I've owned this grill pan for almost 2 years now and it does a great job of grilling everything from burgers to chicken, fish and thick steaks. It has the ability to heat up to a very high temperature, enabling me to nicely sear the outside of the meat. I can then pop the whole pan in the oven to finish cooking the inside of thick steaks or just to keep warm. As for clean up, the pan does need to sit and soak for a little while but after that, everything comes off with relative ease. No hard scrubbing involved. Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it."
3,So hard to clean !,"I just purchased this grill pan and was so excited to use it. I washed it and seasoned it before use as recommended by the manufacturer. I used it for hamburgers and although the meat tasted great, the pan was so hard to clean. Some of the burnt on pieces got into the grooves and despite my best efforts, I could not get everything off. My husband had to spend 15 mn scraping away with a plastic spoon! I chose this pan instead of the Le Creuset for the supposed easy clean up and I am disappointed."
3,All songs sound the same,"I like Asleep at the Wheel-but this video was a bit boring to me. After a while, all the songs sound the same, I wish they would have injected a little more deversity. You have to be a die hard to go bannans for this video. Myself, it hardly is not worth the money spent."
5,Thank you after quite a long wait.. it finally arrived,I love this motion picture soundtrack!! Makes my ride to work less boring. The movie is fun to watch too.
4,Back to The Sixties!,Music from the Mermaids makes me (a woman of a certain age) very nostalgic. Some of the songs from the soundtrack were omitted but most of the good were there. I enjoy every night on my IPOD as I fall asleep and dream of the old days.
5,A Vegetarian Basic!,"After checking this book out of our local library, I quickly realized that I would use it more than many other vegetarian cookbooks. Her choice of recipes is very interesting - simple, with different combinations of foods from across the country. Did you know that when you're ""on the red and white"" in New Orleans, you're low on money and eating a tasty kidney bean and rice casserole?"
5,Best Medicine,"Getting cold sores or stress sores all of the time, I've tried everything - OTC, Rx, etc. This is by far the best I've ever used. It burns a little bit when first applying, but cold sores that usually last me over a week only last 3-4 days with this."
5,Perfect! Highly recommend,I'm very happy with this product as the folders are just as described. The price was affordable compared to other companies and the folders are a very nice touch for presentations to my customers.
5,An Excellent Self-help book!,"This is an excellent self-help book. Page ""58"" is very helpful to overcome immediate allergic reaction temporarily. On the very first visit, Dr. Mala taught me how to use these points. Every morning when I wake up I massage these points before I get out of bed. That gives me tremendous energy all day along. During my initial NAET treatments, I was advised to massage these points every two hours. That helped me pass my treatments without any unpleasant reactions. I love this book."
5,Piaget and Knowledge,"From book's back cover""""Piaget and Knowledge is the only book to systematically elucidate fundamental concepts in Piaget's work in light of his overall theory. Piaget, Furth points out, has removed knowledge and intellince from the purely philosophical sphere and placed them in the realm of biology as functions of organic development. It is Furth's insistence on the biological and epistemlogical bases of the theory of development (an insistence confirmed by Piaget himself) that unifies and interrelates the various technical concepts examined in each chapter. With the addition of a new and substantial chapter on equilibraton, the central concept in Piaget's more recent work, this second edition of Piaget and Knowledge provides the reader with an introduction to all the basic concepts of Piaget's theory as it stands today [circa 1981]."""
1,Do not trust this man,"May be Mr Palmer is a good English teacher, but this book is a disaster. You'll find no details on the biography of one of the world greatest improvisers EVER. Instead the author feeds the reader with his very personal (and seldom valuable)judgments on the music, citations from other critics and pseudo-important academic bla-blas. The writing is sloppy, you can find a mysterious trumpeter Kinny Dorham (the name every jazz fan knows as Kenny), he forces Mr. Rollins to be born in 1929 pushing him one year back (he was born on 9/7/1930), attached sheet music contains a lot of errors and St Thomas is transposed half tone up. My advice - if you are a real fan of Mr. Rollins do not buy this reading will irritate you and raise your blood pressure."
3,basic information required,"in, my not so humble opinion,all books of this type should have as comprehensive a discography as possible ....certainly any adverts for such should indicate the presence or not of one...willietmitchell"
3,A solid documentary,This DVD is composed of two smaller documentaries. The sound quality is not very good and the narrator a bit boring but the content of the narration is not too bad and the film clips used are pretty good. So while overall it is not a great documentary it is not bad either and gets the job done.
5,Tesla's best album!Period!,This is by far their best album ever IMO.Song&Emotion is worth buying the whole album for.This is at least the 3rd or 4th time I've purchased this album.
3,Tesla Slips a bit,"Tesla is one of those bands that couldn't write a bad album if they tried. Psychotic is an album that has a few missteps (Call It What You Want, Don't Derock Me, Freedom Slaves) but it's a worthy follow up to The Great Radio Controversy despite the fact that it's not as good. Bear in mind though that Controversy is by far the best album that Tesla has ever done. Because of those slight missteps it's at least a three star effort that will not only appeal to old fans but can also make a great introduction to band that has created a legacy of great music."
1,Horrible!,"I recently pulled this CD out of my collection and gave it a listen. Horrible music from the first track to the last. Cookie cutter riffs, formulaic song writing and inane cock rock lyrics: ""Now we'll keep the fire burnin' And this old world will keep spinnin' 'round and 'round, and around."" I loved mechanical resonance and I remember eagerly buying this CD and seeing them on tour in support of this stinker over 20 years ago. The concert was in Pensacola FL and these tools had the guts to play ""Freedom Slaves"" to a primarily military audience to a chorus of boos. I wasn't impressed with them then, and it still holds true today. UGH! Save your money!"
4,All-Clad Stainless Petite Braiser Pan,I have always loved All-Clad products and this Braiser Pan is no exception. I've used it countless times since I got it and it's lived up the to the All-Clad reputation for quality. It's a purfect size for a single person. I love that it can go directly from the burner into the oven. This braiser pan has become the pan I use most.
1,Amazon is selling the same pan elsewhere for much less!,"As a heads up to Amazon customers, please be aware that this EXACT SAME pan is being sold on Amazon as ""All-Clad All Purpose Pan with Domed Lid"" for far less money. I called All-Clad's customer service to ensure that both pans were exactly the same and there wasn't a quality difference between them. They assured me that the pans are one and the same thing! I had previously called Amazon to try to figure this out and Amazon customer service was not able to give me this information, which is why I called the company directly."
1,$14.99 for 18/8 misrepresented as 18/10,"These are chrome-shiny and small. I don't like them but I thought they were 18/10, affordable and I needed them for my buffet dinner.I would never have ordered them if I had known they were 18/8. Oh, boy.If you don't have to have serving spoons and are not on a budget, I would recommend passing on these pieces because they aren't pretty nor are they plain in a nice way."
5,Just what I needed,"Finally replaced the door knocker on our front door (after 5 years of having the former owner's name on the previous one). Measured the space between the screws (didn't want further holes in the door), and searched on that measurement -- found this knocker! It arrived quickly, and fit perfectly. Had it engraved, and it looks great."
3,"Didn't work, husband fixed problem","I've read the other responses to this book and I believe they are talking about a drawing book. The book we received was as the picture showed, Finding Nemo (play-a-sound). When we received the book it didn't play sounds. My husband took it apart and ended up putting a piece of aluminum foil between the contacts where the batteries insert. It works great now, but was definitely not working when received. The sounds and animation in the book are just ok. My daughter loves it, though, because she it really into Nemo right now."
2,"some help, but very negative","There are some insightful points made in this book, but it seems to turn every issue the survivor has into their own sinful shortcomings. Whether this has any basis or not it leaves the reader feeling completely invalidated, condemned, and frustrated. There is very little said that is compassionate. Also, the author tries too hard to impress the reader with his vocabulary in a very unpoetic way that is irritating beyond belief. On the Threshold of Hope is much kinder to survivors and offers more hope for healing and restoration."
2,Very disappointing. Same old secular stuff.,"Very disappointing. I was expecting a Godly analysis of abuse and a Godly approach to healing. This book provides neither. He applies the same old secular analysis with some sprinkling of ""godly"" words (small case intended). If you are looking for a Godly book concerning emotional abuse I recommend ""Finding Peace for Your Heart"" by Stormie Omartian."
1,repressed memories?,"this book is barely worth the lowest cost on amazon. 1 cent. this topic has been largely rejected by secular psychology and shown over and over again (in the justice system) to be empty and false. this is not worth much more than a way to start a fire in winter. don't waste your time. this has falsely broken up healthy homes and has zero basis in scripture. a sad commentary, but entirely true."
2,oh well,Freque pretty much summed it all up. I too am another disappointed buyer. If your into heavy synth Trance with cheesy vocals then you might like this.
1,NEGATIVE 4 STARS!!!,"This is the worst Trance cd I have ever bought. I would rather chew broken glass then listen to this cd again. Every song was cheezy. The mixxing was completly amature. There hardly any blending Just a bunch of slaming the crosfader over to the new song. If I were to have spun this cd it would've been the worst cd I ever did. The label reads something to the effect of best vocal trance from europe. I would hardly agree. The lyrics are like a 4th grader, with a SERERIOUS substance issue, in the early eighties wrote a couple of poems and they were made into trance songs.The best song ( in my opinion ) was on disk 2. The track was called falling its #4. Its sad though cause the lyrics have a really similar melody to Lange's- drifting, and its amazing how the beat and synths as a matter of fact the whole song sounds like a bad re-make of tiesto's - flight 646.Sad Sad cd... : (Shame on the producers and dj of this cd.But the cover looks really cool : )"
1,A STUPID-ASS BOOK NOT WORTH READING!!!!!!!!,"THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE.... THIS BOOK MAKES WATCHING JERRY SPRINGER AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE BENEFICIAL FOR US ALL, AND WILL ACTUALLY MAKE ME WANT TO WATCH TOM GREEN SUCKING OFF MILK FROM A COW. ONLY JACKASSES, AND NIMRODS WILL ONLY GIVE THIS BOOK A GOOD RATING BECAUSE OF THIS CRAPPY THING CALLED ""MOVIDA MADRILENA"". IF ONLY FRANCO WAS ALIVE DURING THE 80S. I WOULD GIVE IT A MINUS ZERO RATING, BUT YOU KNOW AMAZON.COM RULES...."
4,Metropolis,Decent book good for anyone interested in science fiction or mystery type book. Some parts are dull however so that is why it deserves 4 stars.
4,Lovely and inspiring,"I love this music, and found this CD to have lyrical interpretations of the variety of Latin American music represented by it. However, I was a wee bit disappointed in one thing. I had a previous tape (lost it) of much of the same music, and the performers were less professional, meaning that the music gained in earthiness which I felt to be a plus. As this recording was done by professionals, it is lyric, musical, and lovely, but lacks that unsophisticated touch which I had liked. Still a very enjoyable recording, though."
3,An Enjoyable Comedy Starring James Garner & Kim Novak,"""Boys' Night Out"" is a good but not great comedy starring James Garner & Kim Novak (along with a strong supporting cast). The premise of the movie is a bit disturbing (if you don't find adultery funny, anyway), but the plot plays out like an episode of ""Three's Company"" with things not being as they seem."
5,SEX COMEDY - 1960s Style,"BOYS NIGHT OUT is finally available remastered on DVD. The film Pillow Talk has had more said about it and its social reflection then this little gem from the same director. This is the era when Playboy magazine and ""The Pill"" were becoming major influences on the so-called Sex Revolution in the US. Boys Night Out is a sex comedy that is very much tied to this time, which in this case quickly dates it but that is true of most comedy. Next to Pillow Talk, I personally feel Boys Night Out is the better film. With Boys Night Out we just have more fun - the writing is better, the directing/editing is tighter and the cast is superb. And what a cast, you can't go wrong with Kim Novak and James Garner and the many supporting actors are Hollywood's best. Note: The title song's clever lyrics were written by the great Sammy Cahn and sung by cast member Patti Page. So set your sexual mores back to 1962 and sit back and enjoy this light romp of lust and love. Recommended!"
3,"Movie: Great / Quality of the ""Digital Remaster"": Poor","A favorite movie of mine arrived from Amazon yesterday. At the top of DVD case with a bright red background, it proclaimed, ""Remastered Edition"". As I said, the movie itself is great. But the quality of the DVD with MANY white spots (the ""digital remastering"") is very poor. So, if you want this DVD right now, Amazon's poor quality transfer DVD is the only game in town. If you don't mind waiting, you might want to write the studio (Warner) and have them release an official, truly digitally remastered DVD. Also, Amazon doesn't give you a break for poor quality; their spotty DVD is full price."
1,WRONG ASPECT RATIO,"Amazon Streaming shows the entire movie in the wrong aspect ratio. On a 16:9 HD display there sould be black bars above and below the picture. Instead it's stretched vertically and everything is too skinny. Ugh. TOTAL FAIL, Amazon."
4,Classic,Just re-read this for the first time in maybe twenty years. What a fun classic. It needs to be on Kindle.
3,interesting read but...,"long on prose and short on data.Another reviewer mentioned ""Collapse"" by Jared Diamond. That book is light-years ahead in terms of scientific information (it's been written by an UCLA Professor after all). ""A Forest Journey"" offers an interesting perspective on how the western civilization wave closely matched wood exploitation, but the text is pretty much devoid of hard data and references and reads more like a novel than as science-related material. Furthermore, sometimes the facts (vague as they are) get stretched to laughable levels (e.g. when the Roman era copper production converted from high-cost smelting to ingots for industrial use into copper salts for medicinal use).3 stars for pointing out the civilization - wood exploitation correlation."
4,Nice Chair,"Nice Sturdy Chair, it is very comfortable and my son hasn't had any complaints about the chair. Seems durable, and I hope it really is..."
5,A nice seat.,My 12 y.o. son is thrilled with his seat. He has a beginning drum set and he uses this for it. It seems to be well built and the seat is nicely padded.
4,Hard,"This throne can adjust the height I want and it is easy to handle. The only one complain is the seat is a little bit hard, but it is still good."
3,It Is OK!,This throne is ok but if you have a little more spending money i would get a different one. this one hurts a lot and looks cushiony but it is not at all. but as i said if you can spend a little more i would do that.
1,Heavy Duty?,This throne is under the Heavy Duty tag for drum thrones but only supports 150lbs? How is that possibly heavy duty.
2,Not worth the money,"If you want a decent drum throne, spend the extra $100. This one sucks. It wobbles, hurts your back, etc. It is something to sit on while you play drums though...that's about all it is."
2,Get what you pay for,"I suppose the old adage is true; you get what you pay for. This is a very cheap, very basic drum throne that should probably satisfy most casual drummer's needs, though I certainly wouldn't recommend it for a professional.So why the two stars? The chair's construction is solid enough to sit on, but it wobbles a bit. There was also an element of added frustration when the drum-key-like screw that holds the seat in place refused to budge, no matter how hard I pulled on it. I had to grab a pair of pliers to move the thing in order to place the seat on the stand. This seems a bit unreasonable for a piece of gear that should be easy to set up and tear down.Pluses: it's cheapMinuses: poor manufacturing quality, frustration"
5,Easily One Of The Best Shows Ever!!!!!!,"After watching Nikita, I now know why most people call Alias a complete ripoff of Le Femme Nikita! Even with Alias boasting a far greater budget, it still couldn't create the cult following this show has made. La Femme Nikita does everything exceptionally well. From storyline, to characters, character development, to settings, music. EVERYTHING just seems to fit together PERFECTLY! And I almost couldn't believe how each episode just seems to pull me in deeper and deeper into the world of Le Femme Nikita. It was just so ahead of its time, heck their holographic t.v. still looks great even today! :) The cast has to be absolutely praised for their phenomenal work on the show. I promise you, all it takes is one season, and you'll feel the same way I feel!!!!"
2,Gave Up Quickly,"Gave up after 5 episodes. Peta is attractive but too quirky in this role. I also can't stand Roy Dupuis (Micheal), the pretty boy trying to play tough guy. ""The Operator's"" talking with half a mouth aka Gretta Van Sustern is the final straw. Plots are boring and not up to the standards of other spy thriller shows."
3,Besson fans beware...,"This TV series, in particular the first episode, which imitate the great besson original movie is nothing like the original.This being said, it does grow on you and gets better as the episode go... but I bought it seeing there was only ""5 stars"" reviews and if you love the movie (the original one, not the bad remake), you will be disapointed; at first... If you see it as a serie unrelated, it is a a very good TV show, but TV..."
2,Struggling to understand what is so great about this show,"This show has the feel of a porn, except the porn. It's probably in the sets, the lighting, unrealistic situations that are too obviously made up, lack of believable emotions, simplistic dialog and predictable flow. There's very little story in a single episode with almost no twists or thrills. The characters are trying hard to be who they obviously are not. It's painfully clear that the main actress is there for her looks. Arguably the only unexpectedly pleasant part is that all girl-girl interaction has sexual undertones, but then it doesn't go anywhere ;)Makes you wonder how come there are so many good reviews here. So I looked. Seems like nearly all good reviews are from those who watched it when it aired (aside from that, a lot of good reviews are about DVD quality, prompt shipping, etc.). So it's possible that the show wasn't too bad for its time, but doesn't compare at all with the modern shows."
2,Stop Comparing!!!!!!!,"I wish you would stop comparing this show to Alias!!!! And while they may have things alike stop saying alias is a rip-off of it. ONe thing alias has that this doesn't is family drama, and that's a big part of the show. Alias is a great show on it's own so stop comparing!!!!!"
4,About Time - now hurry up with the rest,OK .. Still not sure how good a transfer to disc this will be but La Femme Nikita is a great series that was very losely based on Luc Bessons film of the same name (Remade as The Assassin in the USA with Bridget Fonda - far inferior to the original).The series takes a new slant on the film and ran for 4 full series and a 5th mini series. The series is of mixed writing quality but generally good fun - although the mixed writers can cause some lack of continuity ..The series was very unfairly treated in its 5th series - which seemed to have been purely comisioned to kill it off. However still well worth collecting the whole lot.
5,Operational,"Although the cost is a little steep, the show itselft is still outstanding. Can't wait until Season Two."
3,100$ !?!?!?,I agree this is a LOT of money for 1 season... Friends is 50$ but just has 4 dvd. Maybe 80$ would have been enough.Im a little disappointed that it's only in english. I used to watch it in french lol
5,The Best Show ever!!!,"I have watched a lot of television in my time and the La Femme Nikita Series is by far the best show I have ever seen on television. This DVD set is a buy that I won't regret and you won't either. The show is a product of an incredible cast and crew, with a fantastic storyline to back it up. I have never liked a show enough to buy it, until now. This DVD set is a must buy. Now I am just waiting for the following four seasons to go on sale!!"
5,Didn't miss an episode - even when I was in Labor!,This series was the best series I have ever seen. I have every season on VHS. 2 episodes per tape for the highest quality. I NEVER missed an episode and that includes when I delivered my daughter in 2000!! I was horribly dissapointed when the series came to an end. What was I going to watch??? I waited and waited for the series to come out on DVD...The DVD is AWESOME! It's worth it just for the extra features! This is a MUST buy...!!
5,At Last!!,"At last, the DVD collection has finally arrived! This was the best show on TV for 5 years. It had so many fans that when the network tried to cancel it after 4 seasons the fans rallied and got it renewed for a short fifth and final season. Brilliant writing and acting combined to make it so very interesting and entertaining. Much better than Alias in my opinion. I just hope they release DVD collections for all of the seasons!"

I waited and waited for the series to come out on DVD. I was so excited when Amazon.com emailed me that it was finally going to happen. The DVD is AWESOME! It's worth it just for the extra features! This is a MUST buy...!!
3,"Good Show, Bad DVD","5 Stars For THe Show, 2 Stars For The DVDThe show is fantasic, my grip in the review are hte DVD'sI guess this is what happens when you compress the hell out of it...but theres lots of compression issues in these DVD sets. They look bad, if it wasn't for the fuzz on the television, the origional broadcasts looked better than this."
3,"Show was great, but DVD specials were lacking","I loved this show when it was on and was excited to get the box set, but was disappointed with the redundant commentary on the episodes by the creators. It would have been nice to have the cast and crew back to talk about the filming, the show, etc. as part of the commentary. I don't regret buying this set, but probably won't buy the rest of the series unless the special features are improved."
5,La Femme Nikita - The complete first season,Great series.... loved it.... and the company i ordered from was fantastic... i actually got my DVD's in about 4 days. Looking forward to ordering season 2
5,Nice old series that I really miss,"This is a nice drama series that addressed terrorism in our world before 9-11. It has sex appeal, romance, intrigue, all the things that make for a good series. I am also a big Pita Wilson fan so it is nice to watch her in her starring series."
5,LFN- Season 1,Great series for a good price! Good packaging and it arrived two days sooner than expected!I just ordered Seasons 2 and 3.
5,Cherchez La Femme,"I have always loved the ALIAS Television series. I hadn't seen anything yet! When I purchsed La Femme Nikita and watched it, not only was Roy Dupuis hot, but the story of the section and Nikita's life was awesome. I was attached to it. I watched the series for threee days staraight becuase it kept me hooked. I have now watched it so much I have fallen in love with this series. The story of Michael(Dupuis) and Nikita(Wilson) is amazing. I had always wanted to see a series where two of the main characters have fallen in love and have fought and not told one another. Jealousy goes between both when ""Pretend"" love is given for missions. People get shot and injured. Arguments between lovers are so real and the times where you see then together are done really well. It ends with a tear-jerker to me. I cried at the ending of this Season. Purchasing this is not a waste of money. (Watching it right now actually.)"
5,Nikita,"I caught probably less than 20 episodes total when this was running on the USA network at 1AM, yet each time I enjoyed the plot, characters and technical details of the show immensely. I'm looking forward to owning copies of the show and watching it from the beginning."
2,Not enough old footage,I was disappointed with this DVD because most of the footage seemed to have been filmed after Diana's divorce. I was hoping for more older footage from the 1980s.
2,Nothing new,"This DVD is not about the Princess's life, it contains no interesting footage, like one from her wedding or from the early 80's..."
1,Do not waste your money on this one,You'll be disappointed if you spend anything on this DVD. Please do not buy it.
1,A Horrible Hagiography of a Dreadful Person,"In the strange mirror-world of celebrity people are very often the reverse of what they seem. JF Kennedy a faithful husband? Diana was not what she seemed to the hoi polloi. To put it bluntly, she couldn't even keep staff for very long before they tired of her psychotic antics."
5,nice hatchet,"We gave this as a gift to a man who loves camping. The person likes it. For a hatchet, it is beautiful!"
3,My husband loved the first one he received,"My husband loved the first one he received, so he order another one for him and also one for a friend. Unfortunately, the next hatchet was not of the same quality as the first."
3,Not quite worth the price,"Had a stump in the yard to work on, so I compared side-by-side with a standard $16 Craftsman camp axe. Prepared both blades the same way, to the same initial sharpness. Estwing was almost negliibly lighter, looks nicer, sleeker steel handle, and has a nicer leather case. The other has a plastic clip to put over the blade, wood handle, feels more comfortable in my hand, has better balance, chopped better, was easier to handle, and retained its sharpness better. Neither was bad, but unless a few ounces matter, I know which I'd take with me."
3,Factory second....third?,"I was not even looking for another hatchet until I saw the Estwing Sportsman's Hatchet being manufactured on The Science Channel program, ""How It's Made"". Now that looked like a work of art. Checked the reviews on Amazon prior to ordering so the burrs on the blade edge were not a big surprise. That's easily fixed. What was not so easily fixed was the large burr on the handle butt plate located just so that it was very annoying. I fixed that with some work with a Dremel tool. What I cannot fix are the bumps and grains under the finish on the handle. One reviewer remarked that the hatchet was to nice to toss in the toolbox. My forty year old hatchet will get used more than this one. Or possibly my expectations were to high....no, poor quality control."
3,Good Product,It is a good product but it is probably as durable as a coleman hatchet. Anda lot more expensive.
5,Matchless Estwing,I recently bought my 2nd Estwing hathcet in over 35 yrs. I like this brand and the single metal forged head/handle design. I put a nice edge on it with a grinder and a metal file and it holds a edge a long time. I have other Estwing hand tools and they are comparable to Craftsman quality to me. I could have bought a ordinary hatchet from a local Dept. store for under $10. But quality is important to me and if taken well care of and not abused this hatchet will last for years. The best part of this purchase I was able to use 2/3 of the purchase price with my Discover card cashback bonus which would have expired 01/12. I am one happy camper and that's all I have to say about that. rft
2,not happy,Same to report as others. Definitely do not buy unless you can do so in person. Found blade edge to be WAY off center. Poor quality. Not happy at all. Very bad response from Estwing service.Spend your money on KOA or something whose manufacturer takes pride in their work.
4,Neat little hatchet,"One piece metal hatchet, doubt if I will break it, even being ""bad"". But it gets the job done. Probably should have given it top marks but, it's a tool, so until a year or two passes by I won't know."
3,"Good metal, poor handle","I have an old copy of this and its pretty sharp with good metal, but the problem I have is the handle. It got wet and just fell apart (it looks like wood in the pic, but its laminated leather and dry rotted). I called Estwing and they said it happens but there was nothing they can do. I figure a camp axe should be more durable than that. Now my beautiful hatchet has tape for a handle. No one else has reported this here, but they know of the problem at Estwing and don't have a solution. I would recommend getting it with the rubber handle if you think it may ever get wet (which I did with the longer handle), but if you want something to look pretty on the hearth to split kindling this is the ticket."
5,a cut above the rest,Just like the original one I had in the mid-eighties.Glad to see that the quality has not lessened.Thanks
5,Lifetime Buy,"I am 64, and am still using the Estwing hatchet that I used in the Boy Scouts in late 1950s-early 1960s. I don't camp much anymore, but when I do, it goes along. Unfortunately, the leather sheath is long since gone, so I have to be careful using it for a hammer. It has numerous uses around the house for making wedges, splitting small pieces, and for cutting kindling. There is not a better hatchet. It will be an heirloom for grandchildren, for me and for you, before it breaks. By that standard, it's the best value one could possibly find."
4,good little hatchet,"I can see why other reviewers would say these hatchets get passed down from generation to generation. Its well made and lightweight enough to take backpacking, which is why I bought it. I like that the sheath is made from leather. My one complaint would be that it is unevenly made. The edges are a bit sloppy all around. I will probably treat the grip with some oil or other waterproofing agent, just to make sure the leather doesn't get wet and start to separate or shrink. Even if it does, it could be wrapped with paracord and that would be just as comfortable and useful as well. I'm glad I got this hatchet."
5,Love it,Have used the hatchet on multiple camping trips to make firewood and has stayed sharp for over a year. Seems to be great quality and not worried at all about it breaking like cheaper hatchets.
3,Good feel but questionable durability,"I purchased this hatchet for chopping wood and branches on camping trips. I primarily use it for shaving slivers off of logs to use a kindling. The weighting of the hatchet is nice and feels good in my hand. I was, however expecting the handle to be a little softer as it is has a leather grip, but it feels as hard as wood. After a chopping for a while, your hand can start to hurt a little.My biggest concern is with the durability. I never chop hard woods and noticed considerable dings in the blade. Out of the box, the blade was razor sharp, but after about 2 months of use, it was dinged and dull. I used a rotary sharpening blade which seemed to get the rough spots out but only time will tell how long it will last before another run on the sharpener is required.I have nothing to compare it to so as for the value, I cannot say."
5,hatchet review,this hatchet would be great for splitting wood. It's got some weight too it and seems very durable. glad I purchased it.
3,Decent but not amazing,"The edge was choppy so it needed sharpening right away which worked well. When in use, it needs to be continually sharpened as it doesn't hold an edge that well. That said, it is good for the price"
1,"Used to be made in USA, now made in China",All Clad used to produce in USA. I searched SS bowls made in USA and these came up at the top of the list - but they are made in China. Will need to send them back.
5,Glad I have them!,I got these as a gift and I love them! I was using serving bowls to mix and prep food in and it was unwieldy. The shape of the bowls & different sizes are perfect for different kinds of food preparation. I like the clean stainless and they stay cold for cold prep. Handles are perfect for gripping without getting in the way. I recommend them!
3,Great idea that just misses,"I really wanted to buy these bowls. Handles looked very useful and the quality appeared to be first rate. But the gap between the handle and the bowl is too small for my fingers and I don't have the thickest fingers in the world. It just made using the bowls difficult, irritating and tiring. I wonder why All-clad designed it this way. I would not recommend the set unless they redesigned the handles."
4,"Pretty average mixing bowls, made in China","These bowls aren't built any better than some of my cheaper $10 mixing bowls and these All-Clad bowls cost over $33 each. To me, that's unacceptable. I don't buy into the All-Clad hype. I have several All-Clad pots and pans, several Calphalon Contemporary pots and pans, and so on. I don't care if it's made in the U.S. or China but what I do care about is value and while the quality of these bowls is certainly acceptable, the price is too high for what you get (an All-Clad logo etched in the handle of a standard 18/10 stainless bowl.)These bowls used to be made better; I have some that I bought over 10 years ago and they were much better. These are your average, everyday mixing bowls."
1,Poor sound and broke within a year,"There is quite a bit of sound interference - white noise. Worst of all, the flexible electronic ear band broke and now hangs loose. This was without rough or even regular use. Though the unique design helps it stay on your ear - the reason I bought it - I won't buy it again. Just too pricey for such a high branded, yet low sound quality, fragile headset."
3,doesn't fit my phone,"I used it with my Sony Ericsson W600i. It was comfort to wear, but easy to fall off than others with hook. Sound quality was relatively low."
2,Good concept...,"This was an excellent earpiece, except it has no noise reduction. Everything else about it is great...the design for odd ears like mine keep it on the ear well. Noise reduction is vital, though, and I am surprised this late of a model didn't have it."
5,I Love Bill Slider!,"Quick, those of you who like English Procedural mysteries. You will not be sorry if you take up this series. I love Bill Slider. He is really appealing and a good detective too. In this book Slider is trying to adjust to life without his wife and two children, and also without his lady love Joanna. He isn't handling single life that well, but a murder occurs that takes his mind off his personal problems. The victim in this story was very unlikeable, but it happens that he is the conductor for Joanna's orchestra, so at least Bill gets to see her in connection with the case. Before the murderer is discovered, Bill Slider finds a whole closet full of secrets in the victim's closet. Ms Harrod-Eagles keeps you guessing until the end with this one. Another good installment in the series."
2,Not hardware RAID,If you are looking for a hardware RAID card (like I was)then don't get this card. If you want an entry level software RAID card to use with Windows only then this card is fine
4,Informative and Confronting,It's a good read as history and for the legal intrigues but I wasn't warned about the macabre photos. Nonetheless it's well written and good reference material documenting that part of history.
5,Greatness,"Many books have been written giving detailed accounts of every aspect of World War II. This is the first I have read that takes you into the hearts and minds of the criminals responsible for the death and destruction during WW II. The what, where, and when have always been known. This helps to explain why they did what they did.There is also strong similarities between then and now. ..."
2,Overy Misses the Point Big Time,"Actually, the Nuremberg Trials were a complete sham in terms of following international law and legal procedures and unfortunately Overy just adds to the sham. Basing their evidence upon a prisoner's interrogation, who will say anything to his interrogators to save his own skin, was pretty outrageous and illegal in its own right. In fact, the unusual rules that these allies implemented for the trial could be applied against our leaders who conducted the Vietnam War. But the biggest tragedy of the Nuremberg Trials was the myths it had created and has sustained about what really happened in Germany and why."
5,Great book for our learning library,"Disclaimer - I am not a blacksmith. However, I am compiling a learning library for new smiths. This book is clear, concise, and because of how thorough it is, appears to be a great tool for any aspiring artist blacksmith. Of all the books I have purchased to date, this is the one I would recommend to new smiths to purchase for their personal libraries. I have attended numerous blacksmith classes, and find the same information being offered in this book that the seasoned smiths are teaching."
4,Good value,"After the built-in DVD player in my 2-year-old Toshiba TV went south, I bought this unit. It was easy to hook up: the composite jacks matched the inputs on the TV; couldn't use the component jacks and coaxial digital outputs, unfortunately. ... The composite hookup provides picture and sound quality on a par with VHS; the quality is noticeably inferior to that of the Toshiba's built-in player. Playing CDs is very disappointing. The sound reproduction is so poor I just won't use it for that.I'm not complaining, though. For the money, this unit is probably hard to beat. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the remote control is programmable and compatible with the Toshiba (wish it had a mute button)."
1,"Great price, but broke 2 wks later.","Either I bought a lemon or it's not the best product.This DVD player just stopped working 2 weeks after purchase.However, Sony has a decent return policy and a re-furbished one is on it's way. We'll see how this one performs, hopefully I'll be changing my review.TIP: Spend a little more and get a step or two ""better"" DVD player."
2,No S-video output as listed,"Although the detailed information says that the unit does have an S-video output, in fact, it does not. If you don't care about S-video, then it's a good product."
4,Great product,"I was really impressed with this DVD player. Everything runs very smoothly, and I like how the player responds quickly to the remote, without having to point it directly to the device. Decent sound and picture quality (for my non-fancy TV). Another cool feature is that you can stop or pause a DVD, and no matter how long it was stopped, you can press ""Play"" and the player will pick up right where you left off. I even turned it off one time and it still recalled my spot in the movie. I'll probably keep this for a long time. Never get a no-name brand, as I learned when my Sylvania broke."
2,Bad Product,"I bought the product because my old DVD player died. The message said it could not read any of the DVD's I put in and I tried a number of different types that is said it would play. Nothing worked. I don't know if I got a defective player or if the model is no good. On the good side, the refund was rather fast. I went to Walmart and bought a different brand instead."
4,"Nice, very Nice",Sony delivers it again. Simply amazing product from sony. No complaints whatsoever. Great for the price.
3,Sound and Viewing Issues,This DVD player has two flaws in my opinion. One is sound. I can never get enough volume and often must use the closed caption feature. I do not have this problem with the TV or even with my ancient VCR ! The other problem is sometimes vertical lines appear across the screen and will only go away if the DVD is unplugged from the power source for at least 30 minutes. I am disappointed with this DVD Player.
1,"Loading, loading, loading...","I have had this dvd player for just over a year, but it spent over 8mths of that time in storage during my deployment. When I returned from deployment, it worked very well for about 6mths, but now it just keeps saying loading and will not play any dvds. I thought I was buying a quality product when I bought the Sony brand. From the other reviews I have read, it sounds like this player has about a 1 year lifespan. I will not buy another Sony."
4,as promised,dvd player is good and as discribed on internet...same price as walmart but no shipping charge and NO GAS...
1,terrible,"I bought this in early January 2008. For the first 3 months it has been fine, but over the last month it has progressed from freezing infrequently to not being able to play any disc at all. Now when I place a disc in the player disc it loads for about 10 minutes and then I get a message that the disc is dirty, even if the disc is brand new and absolutely pristine. It's going directly into the trash bin."
3,I have a question???,Any could tell me if this DVD can display DVD region 2 PAL format? Thanks for your help.
1,did not work,DVD player would not read any DVD's. I mailed it back in for a refund as I was told to do by Amazon. I received my refund from Amazon with no problem. Thanks!
5,DVD Player,I am very happy with this DVD player. It's performing well and doing what I expected of this product.
4,Tough to beat,"The Sony DVP-NS57P/S DVD player turned out to be a perfect fit for our small Phillips flat screen. We just wanted to be able to watch DVDs in another room without a lot of hassle and expense. So far, so good! We set the TV right on top of the space-saving Sony DVD and the two of them take up no space at all. Performance of the player has been exemplary. And as usual, Amazon's ordering and shipping were terrific. The player arrived much sooner than expected, even choosing the free shipping option.If you're looking for a basic, quality player from a top brand at a small price, I don't think you can go wrong."
2,Buzzing noise,"Purchased this player to replace an old one: after inserting a DVD and the image appeared, wherever there is high contrast there is an accompanying buzzing noise that cannot be eliminated. When the picture contrast is 'medium' or moderate, the buzz is not so apparent. I won't bother to return it because that would be more trouble than it is worth but will think twice when purchasing a second one for one of my other television locations."
4,very basic player,the only thing I don't like is the player dosen't pas RF. It cannot be used as a tuner. but good player otherwise.
2,Spend the extra 25 dollars for the more expensive sony dvd player,The player arrived with the dvd in the open position and it would not work when hooked up. The workmanship is pretty shoddy. I returned it to amazon and got a full refund. I then purchased the upconverting dvd by sony on amazon and am very pleased with the quality and the picture.
1,limited usefulness,"This book has very limited usefulness. I was quite disappointed with it. A much better book is, ""Cracking the Code"" by Pete Hendrickson which can be found at losthorizons.com."
5,album of the year,"Velvet Cacoon play their own unique brand of black metal influenced music. The music is usually fast and hypnotic backed by drums that move like a racing heartbeat. When it isn't going fast, the music slows down to a sigh and ventures into clear channel bliss like the speed of fog(it can get slow which is good). The production sounds like it was recorded in a giant tank of water. It has a really clean, aquatic sound. I haven't heard a band that really sounds like this, though I think Filosefum era Burzum is somewhat similar in style they are two different bands. I strongly suggest you pick this up if you are into black metal like Burzum or Drudkh and even if you aren't."
3,Old-school science fiction with some big ideas,"This is the first Vance novel I have read. It is definitely old-school science fiction, almost pulp-ish, with a many-twisted plot that is sometimes hard to follow and some thinly drawn characters (particularly the women). But I appreciated Vance's big ideas about the lure of immortality and the lengths people will go to achieve it."
5,"good film and great Holmes, but BAD LOOKING AND SOUNDING","THIS MOVIE LOOKS VERY GRAINY AND THE SOUND IS FILLED WITH STATIC, but if you don't mind those things it's not bad. Wonter's films are in terrible shape, but he's damn good. I enjoy him in all his Holmes films despite their rough condition. I give Wonter 5 stars."
1,"Funny, but not as funny as I'd remembered","I saw this first in college, and remembered it as being really funny. I must have been ""under the influence"" because it really wasn't as funny as I remembered. Buy something funnier."
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made.,"The title of my review says it all. I have regarded this piece of garbage as the absolute worst thing I have ever seen for nearly four years now, and I just cannot believe that there are people out there devoid of actual humor enough to enjoy it! This film is the definition of movie-inadequacy for me. This movie is terrible."
4,"""Free Speech"" and a book list as a bonus.","I had read Hentoff's weekly newspaper column for quite a while before I happened upon his book on the library shelf. I liked his column, and so I picked up his book. I thought it was a pretty good read in and of itself, but I really enjoyed it for the list of books he discusses"
5,Excellent product,Item just as beautiful in person as it is in the picture. Great craftsmanship and design!
4,"Not bad, not bad at all...","Overall, this was a worthwhile read. As others have noted, the cover is misleading. This book is a detailed chronicle of the manufacture of the Lunar Module, and not a general history of the Apollo program. In fact, given the number of general apollo histories available, I think it would have sold better had it been more aptly titled. Although a tad melodramatic, the authors weave a cohesive narrative and truly convey the enormous complexity of designing and building the LM. It was nice to read a book that was not just about the astronauts but instead about those who actually put them into space. I would reccommend this book for serious space enthusiasts and not the casual reader. The best chapter is the last one, dealing with the end of the LM program and the fate of the lunar modules, both those that went to the moon and those that stayed on the earth."
4,Space Race Story from a Different Perspective,"This book is a pleasant change from the NASA/Astronaut perspective of the 1960's race to the moon. This story is told through the eyes of one supplier, the lunar module designers and engineers. There must be similar untold stories at Rockwell about developing the command and service module for the Apollo program."
3,"Good as far as it goes, but...","...could have been so much better. Concentrates on the LM with no mention of the rest of the Apollo hardware which I'm sure have stories that are just as interesting. The hardware-centred approach is actually quite refreshing, as I've read loads of works that 'concentrate on the human aspect' (notably Chaikin) but sometimes I want to read about the technology!Frustratingly bitty in parts and sometimes turns into an extended ad for Long Island's (no doubt worthy) Cradle of Aviation Museum. Lots of things could have been explored further - for example the legendary Apollo 13 'towing bill' to Rockwell hints at a rivalry that isn't mentioned explicitly but I'd love to know more about.Still, fascinating stuff with lots of anecdotes, insights, and snippets of info that I hadn't seen elsewhere. However, I guess the definitive work has yet to be written."
3,"Interesting in places, sometimes a bit out of focus","I was hoping for some deep digging into the history of the development of the LM. Instead, the book only hints at this with anecdotes (for example, describing how the LM fuel and oxidizer would create brown or white smoke when exposed to air, revealing leaks) and too often backs off and adds fluff for historical context. Often the book is needlessly dramatic (""get us out...get us out..."") and sometimes bizarre (the part about JFK writing a story that predicted his own assassination -- what was that all about?). The subject matter held my interest and I recommend the book to fans of Space Race history, but I would have preferred something like a LM version of Tracy Kidder's SOUL OF A NEW MACHINE."
4,love 'em!,"We have both items, and our son loves them both. We got them when he was 15 months old, and he is 2 1/2 now and still plays with them. The cell phone is especially a hit. We love that it looks like a ""real"" phone, and have so much fun recording messages for him to play back. When other children come to our house, they always want to play with this phone too. Both the phone and keys have held up well for us - we recommend them!"
2,sounds stopped in less than a month,"These look great- very realistic and my daughter loved to push the buttons, but the sound stopped in both items after less than a month's use. Yes, my one-year-old likes to toss them around, but I doubt she's any rougher than any other one year old! She is no longer interested, now that they don't make noise, so they're pretty much useless to us. They should be built to last longer than that."
1,cell phone is junk,"My kid loved the phone until it stopped working - within 3 days! I am certain this phone suffered no mistreatment within this short time span, and I changed the batteries just to be sure that wasn't the issue. Only one button works now."
4,Great,"Exactly as shown. Product is one of the best ""cell-phones"" and least annoying ""keys"" I've found"
1,Very Disappointed!,"We recieved the phone and key combo set in time to give my baby for Easter. The phone must have a short in it, because the recordings sound awful, you cannot understand them at all. Also, whenever we change the batteries the whole phone goes dead, that is why I am thinking it has a short in it, and that is how it came. The keys however are great. But to pay this price to only have the keys work is ridiculous. I am looking to see if a return or exchange is in order here. I hate buying things online because I cannot just return it or see how the product works before buying it. That is a shame."
2,Nice product - poor design,"I just have the cell phone for my son and he really likes it (I wasn't sure he'd fall for it since he's played with his Dad's real one). However, after about a week, all buttons stopped making sounds when pushed. If you jiggle the batteries, they play a little but once you screw the back back on, nothing works except the ringing when the phone is shut. It is upsetting since my son really likes it and we have to return it already [I'll exchange - hoping the next one will work better]."
5,Listening Pleasure,"There arent many CD's that you can just put in your player and let the whole thing play. However this is one of those. Awesome, emotional music that you cant help but love. Even if you dont normally listen to Tesla, this CD is a must have."
2,I was very disappointed,"The whole reason i bought this cd was to be able to listen to it in my car. However, it will not play at all in the car. Lower quality cd's and cd's that are made at home quality will not play on my cd player, so I thought by ordering them on Amazon I would get new cd's that were good quality."
3,Enjoyable Without Big Pretension.,"Recorded at Trocadero Club in Philladelphia on July 2 1990, Five Man Acoustical Jam is - from my personal point of view- a precursor and probably the musical idea that generated the ""unplugged"" concept which would be developed by you know who shortly afterwards.Tesla delivers an acoustical set, if not brilliant, adequate and well performed. The best tracks are the obvious hits ""Modern Day Cowboy"" and ""Love Song"". Due to the lack of musical background - at that time- of the band, Tesla intelligently supports the show with pleasant acoustic versions of rock classics such as the Rolling Stones' ""Mother Little Helper"", CCR's ""Lodi"" and prominently ""Signs"" originally recorded by the obscure act Five Man Electrical Band which became the album's major hit.Five Man Acoustical Jam in short, is an enjoyable record without big pretension. The ideal CD to listen to on any given hot summer afternoon with a cold six pack next to your favorite couch."
4,This is a great album,"As one reviewer posted, this did not spawn the MTV unplugged era. Bon Jovi did that a couple of years before at the MTV music awards performing Wanted Dead or Alive. Stevie Ray Vaughn was on MTV unplugged in 1989, so no, Tesla did not start the whole unplugged thing. However, this a great album, and for those of you that are fans of unplugged music, this one cannot be overlooked. Signs was the big hit from the album, but I don't think there is a bad song on it. Definitely check it out if you like acoustic music."
5,Public Animal #9 :-),This EP is Pre-Welcome to My Nightmare Alice. It features the original band. I thought it was great to see this rarely seen performance. The quality of the product is very good.A great addition to any Alice Cooper hard core fan's library.
5,"What's Here is Really, Really Good","There's only three videos, but they capture the Alice Cooper Group just as they were becoming the biggest act in show business, and it's easy to see why. Under My Wheels is earlier than the other two and appears to be from 1971 while Alice was still developing his stage persona - no matter, this is definitely cool to watch and hear. I'm Eighteen is almost epic; this looks to be from 1972 and by this time the live version is much enhanced from the classic single. When Alice goes into his ""I Ain't no American Pie"" verse with the band wailing away at high RPM, it's riveting. Public Animal #9 is also quite different from the studio version with lots of interesting guitar work.For ACG fans, it's a must. These guys were SSSOOO good."
3,3 Stars for Only 3 Videos,I gave it three stars because this pricey little DVD has only 3 videos on it. I know for a FACT that the Alice Cooper had more performances from the show these clips were taken from and to release a DVD with only 3 of the songs is rediculous. At least put 5 or 6. It isn't worth the money unless you find it for $5 or less.I will say though that the QUAILTY is OUTSTANDING and CRYSTAL CLEAR.The SOUND is FANTASTIC and offered in a 5.1 or DTS.Please release more vids next time and we'll be satisfied.
4,"good quality, great cooking off of",I had not always appreciated good cook wear as I wasn't much for cooking. I found as I got older I enjoyed the challenge and bought quality knives 1st. Next a respectable set of pots and pans. It did not include a griddle and I bought the same name and design of my pots. it warped! I bought this griddle after the other failed and doing a lot of research. Thus far this griddle has done well and is holding up.
3,"Not LTD, but decent for aluminum","As another reviewer noted, there's no ""LTD"" marking anywhere on the packaging or pan itself. It's a decent pan, such as it is. I give it one star off because it's aluminum, and no aluminum pan can be 5 stars imho. (All-Clad makes a steel no-stick square griddle that's fabulous, but you'll have to buy it at a kitchen store like Williams-Sonoma, as Amazon does not seem to carry it.) Another star off for the deceptive listing about LTD.If you want an aluminum pan, though, I'd say All-Clad is a quality way to go. This is much better than the cheapo pans you can buy at the grocery store."
1,"All-clad11""","I'm a fan of all-clad and I have all LTD , This pan was suppose to be LTD but their no one sign on this pan stating it LTD so someone is lying about this sell them. and this is what the add said (All-Clad LTD 11-Inch Square Nonstick Griddle)"
4,Great for Pancakes,"This nonstick griddle works great. I have only had it a couple of weeks but so far so good. Easy to clean, the nonstick surface works great!"
3,Good but Scratches a Little Too Easily,"I have had this pan for two years. I have probably used it more than 100 times, usually to make pancakes or french toast. It does a very good job, better than the Calphalon griddle that I had before. I downgrade it because it scratches too easily -- and I have made an effort from day one to take very good care of it, using only nylon spatulas, promptly washing it gently by hand, and storing it so it won't be scratched by other pans. Still, after all that care, it has become scratched. So my verdict is that the griddle does a good job but it requires a lot of TLC."
5,Celia: My Life,"Give's a new insight of the love she had for Cuba, her family, and the music she was so proud to perform."
5,Essential addition,"Anticipate an autobiography which is filled with depth, from the ups and downs of Cruz's life to her musical successes and few failures: CELIA: MY LIFE is an essential library addition considering how many myths and rumors abound about Cruz's life."
3,just OK,"These are kind of cheap. The chrome was coming off from the time I opened the box. I also didn't know it was rated for only 40 lbs. It would be nice if Amazon stated that, as it does say it right on the box. The grip isn't as padded as I would like, or not padded at all. They should have just made it a full chrome normal one."
2,Rubber grip is crap,"I have used these dumbbells about 12 times... usually with two 25lb plates on each. However, the grip is starting to tear due to the weights compressing it. Much better off going with a bar without the rubber grip and just buy a pair of gloves."
2,Think before you buy these.,"If you are really tight with space and will shove your weight plates under the bed and have these dumbbell handles hidden somewhere, I still wouldn't recommend these. I started doing P90X a month ago and these are absolutely terrible for it. After every set, you will have to tighten the grip again. Even during sets you will feel the weight wobble. Your best bet is to just get solid dumbbells with the weight already set for you. It requires a little more room. However, if space isn't that big of an issue for you then get what I just requested. The price is relatively the same and you can quickly determine if you need more/less weight during sets in case you need to make a switch."
2,not good,"i bought these dumbells because i needed the collars, but i try to used the whole dumbell instead and there terrebile. Your hand well be scrushed between the weight on each side of the dumbell. the rubber doesn't protect much, your better off bujying the dumbells without the rubber."
3,padding? what padding?,"as per the description, i ordered those thinking they would come with a rubber grip, alas it's just all metal, unlike the ones i had purchased at sports authority. other than that they work as they should. -2 stars for misleading description."
1,No rubber. No protection.,"I've opted to return this item since the handle bars are I received are not actually covered in rubber... i want to keep my hands soft like a babies behind. ... like real manly baby hands. But seriously, there was no rubber on the handles, just textured steel."
4,excellent product,"Buy this with some of the Standard Flat Plates, or whatever plates you want, and you get an excellent cheap weight set. The grip is good, but by no means perfect.The only problem is that the grip is too flexible. The plates will tilt slightly, but this is tolerable, especially for the low price. Hence the 4-star rating. For the price, this product is easily 5 stars, but to give this 5 stars is to pretend that it is perfect."
2,Sloppy threads,"I gave this two stars because they hold the plates. However, the nuts are threaded very poorly. They do not mate well with the threaded bar. Although I was able to tighten them on my weight plates, I am concerned that I could easily overtighten them and strip them. I typically use 40 pounds per bar, so I am concerned about injury if the nuts fail. I saw a similar review for the Gold's Gym dumbbell bars (Gold's Gym Dumbbell Handle) and I bought these instead. It looks like it's the same sloppy manufacturing for these as well. I would recommend that you get something from another manufacturer."
3,Not quite standard,"I bought the Apex handles plus Valeo standard spring collars, to allow me to change weights faster and to more securely fasten the weight plates in place. The padding does protect one's hands when using heavy weights, reducing the formation of callouses. However, the circumference of the handles is less than standard size so the spring collars are too large. I tried the collars on a set of Weider handles I have and they fit just fine. Another annoying characteristic is the styrofoam in which the handles are packed, as it left flecks of foam on the handles and in the room where I unpacked."
3,LR sheet set for Queen Pillowtop,It took awhile for Macy's to ship the items but everything showed up quickly once they did. The sheets are mid range in comfort. They fit my 14-15 inch pillow top comfortably and do not come loose overnight. These sheets seem to stay wrinkled and I'm sure once they are washed several times will soften up. I'm a really picky person when it comes to quality and these sheets are priced correctly
2,Traditional Story...,"I know that the three Musketeers is a traditional story...BUT, why not let Cantiflas really add his own twist to the story?? Cantiflas followed the story line for way too long and I found it boring. Not a good part for him. If you like the traditional story, then this movie is for you. I bought it because I wanted to see the comic at his very best, and was disappointed."
1,Always Off Balance,"No matter how I try to set this spoon in a dish or a pot it is off balance and ends up falling out. I am sick of it, it is going in the trash!"
2,Why add metal to this spoon?,The metal plate on this spoon is purely decorative and heats up if you prop the spoon for a time on the side of the pan. It's a silly addition to an already clunky handle -- impossible to store this spoon in a countertop utensil holder.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype!,"This shaver holds a great charge and you can use it in the shower, but that's about it. The shave isn't very close, and it takes a long time to shave. To do your underarms is somewhat painful with the pulling of the razor."
2,The only thing this shaves is money from your account!,"I have bought electric shavers in the past and really liked them, however, this one is not worth the money!!!! I find that is is too large for those ""hard to reach"" areas and leaves the hair very prickly! Not exactly the place where you want to feel like a cactus! In all, I like electric shavers, but this one did not make the cut!"
1,the worst I have tried,"My old razor died, and since I had good luck with Panasonic in the past I decided to get this one. Bad Idea. This unit has ZERO power. It does not make any discernable difference at ALL. I tried shaving dry, as I would with any electric. I tried shaving in the shower with lotion, as this is supposed to be a ""wet/dry"" unit. It was just the same as if I had done nothing.Back to disposables for now.BTW I would have given this zero stars but the system won't let me."
5,one of the most remarkable tools available for the soul,"Many cultures all over the world have a ""Book of the Dead"", which are stories or poems, etc., meant to ready the dying for their upcoming Otherworld journey. Caitlin Matthews has applied this concept to Celtic immrama (wonder voyages), in particular using the Voyage of Maelduin for this card set. This set is a remarkable tool for shamanic journeying as well as a helper during ""crossing over"" points in life of all kinds. The set is wonderfully constructed and includes a cloth with the immram spread imprinted on it. The art is wonderfully like a collage and captures the Otherworld feel quite well. This set is fabulously complex with Matthews presenting multiple ways to grow and learn with these cards, as well as being a beautiful tool to actually lead the dying, should you be called or need to do so. I cannot recommend this book and card set enough."
2,Aerosmith Turns Pop?,"I have had this CD for awhile and I noticed that ""Amazing"", Cryin'"" and ""Crazy"" are almost identical! When this album hit in 1993, Aerosmith exploded onto the adult contemporary charts, as well as the videowaves, thanks to Alicia Silverstone. Even the Grammy Award-winning instrumental ""Boogie Man"" has its flaws. The whole album sounds lost, and Steven Tyler sounds tired. Boring. Get A Grip!"
5,Awesome Album,"Get a Grip is a great Aerosmith album. Who ould have thought they could top Pump? It has awesome songs that everyone knows like Cryin, Eat the Rich and Crazy, but I think the best stuff on the album are the songs most people dont know...for example, Get a Grip, Gotta Love it, Flesh, etc...anyway...its a great album, go out and get it!!!"
3,There's More Than Just Singles,"I love Aerosmith as much as the next guy, but to give this album anything more than a fair review would simply be wrong. True, ""Livin on the Edge"" and ""Cryin"" are amazing songs that capture the band at their peak. Even ""Eat the Rich"" and ""Amazing"" have their redeeming qualities. ""Flesh"" is also an interesting experiment. However, they can't carry the load for the rest of the album. Although those songs are wonderful, there are 14 tracks on this album and 10 of them range from fair to borderline suck.This is simply what happens when a band overproduces an album. They spent too much time recording, stretching their experimenting so far that they lost that spark of energy that comes with the early excitement of playing a song.It's an interesting period in the band's life so it's worth purchasing. But in the end, it's hard to say it's not the worst album they've released since they jumped on the wagon for the pop-inclined(""Permanent Vacation-present)."
2,Not much to hold on to,"2 1/2What sounded like their most polished and accessible album at the time has not seemed to have aged so well. Asides from the major hits that came from this disc, most of the album sounds like overproduced, underwritten 90's blues-tinged arena rock."
2,SUPER SEXY/SUPER SAD,"OK SO I BOUGHT THIS 'ALBUM' THE OTHER DAY AND I WAS LIKE WHOA! THAT IS A GREAT COVER, SO I TOOK IT HOME AND I POPPED IT IN THE CD PLAYER...SERIOUSLY THOUGH... I HIT **PLAY** AND I WAS JSUT VIBING ON THE TUNES AND I SAT BACK AND I FELT SO HAPPY INSIDE.. WHERE AS METALLICRAPA HAVE REALLY FEMININE VOCALS THESE GUYS ARE SO SEXY POWERFUL.. LIKE A WILD BOAR.. YOU KNOW??SO I GOT THROUGH THE FIRST FEW TRACKS AND I WAS PLEASED BUT THEN ***BAM!!!*** ..SLUDGE.. REALLY LAME SLUDGE.. I WAS DEVASTATED.. THESE GUYS WERE SO MANLY AND POWERFUL LIKE MY OTHER FAVOURITE GROUP THE LEGENDERY ''CHICAGO'' BUT WHERE AS THEY SANG ""IF YOU LEAV EME NOW YOU TAKE AWAY THE BIGGEST PART OF ME.."" YOU KNOW?? THSEE GUYS SING ""LAME"" YEAH YOU HEARD ME!AEROSMITH STINK! DEAL WITH IT!!"
4,Great,"This cd is great! It is one of the best aero albums yet! I am nine years old. I have been listening to aerosmith since i was one, and GAG was the first album i had heard from aerosmith. The next nine lives. I think nine lives is a five star though. Still this cd is great."
2,A rare miss from Asmith,"This is by far my LEAST favorite Aerosmith Album (and thats including Rock in a Hard Place). Mind you, I have nothing against ""new Aersomith"" or ""Hit songs"" and in fact think G.A.G.'s follow up, 9 lives, and the new Just Press Play are two of their best albums. Get a Grip has a few high points (Eat the Rich, Get a Grip, Amazing, Walk on Down) but it never really works as an album. The band sounds as if it wants to do something other than what their label was forcing them to do and the result sounds like a lot of filler. With few exceptions, the Joe Perry factor (bombastic, loud, swankey guitar rock) is at a minimum. If your looking for examples of what makes later-day Aerosmith great look to Just Press Play, 9 Lives or PUMP before stopping here. Better yet sit down with the older albums Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic, or Rocks. Get a grip has some good songs on it - but there are better places to start."
3,the ballads - again with the ballads,"Overkill did me in.I liked ""Living On The Edge"" and ""Fever"". But those ballads are more than annoying.I got nothing against Aerosmith doing what they are good at but ENOUGH IS ENOUGH."
1,"Get A Grip, Indeed","I bought this the day it came out, listened to it all the way through three times, and tossed it out the window of my apartment in Boston. The only songs I can stomach are ""Livin' On The Edge"" and one other one towards the end that I can't remember the name of...something about dancing.Anyway, for all of the bashing that I hear about Rock..Hard Place and Done w/ Mirrors, this album is absolute crap.Why they became so huge again in the late 80's is a complete mystery to me. Glossy production, horrible lyrics, unimaginative grooves and those horrible, HORRIBLE power ballads are NOT what made Aerosmith a classis band - Go buy Toys In The Attic or Rocks NOW...and toss this garbage in the trash where it belongs."
5,To those about POWER BALLADA i salute you!,"People always don't want to hear any ballads in a hard-rock band's album.Alright, let's say: it's ok. it's true. But, however, it's not the case of Aero. You know: Steven's extraordinary talent of making a GOOD & MOVING mellody makes Aerosmith be able to carry the title of "" inventer of power ballads"". back to 73, there were never a ballad have been interpreted with so much POWER as Dream on had,actually,Tyler taught the world how to express one's willing and feeling. and of course, the PB always forms a fundamental part of the history of AEro. Ofcourse Aero's hard-rock is among the very best of the planet, but you can't deny that they can do good ballads,too.It's not sell out,they do it just cos they are gifted. So, don't make me laught of saying in a Aero album there should not be any ballads.(however,I'm a hard-rock lover)"
4,A very good album,"1993, the music world as we knew was changed forever by a musical revolution that invaded from Seattle. Grunge was all over the place and the face of music was different than what AEROSMITH was used to. GET A GRIP was released at this point in time and its resulting success proved that no matter what the musical climate maybe, AEROSMITH will still continue to rock. While not as raw as their earlier efforts, this album is still full of balls to the walls rockin' songs that should be played loud. EAT THE RICH, GET A GRIP, FEVER, LIVIN ON THE EDGE are just rockin songs that show the band still has the drive and energy to just rock. CRYIN, AMAZING, and CRAZY slow the tempo down abit but the album does not lose its momentum. This album has went on to sell like 12 million copies or something like that and I dont think many people out of that number are disappointed. This is a solid slab of rock and I think any music fan will enjoy this."
4,Rockin' It Soft,"There's some really good music on this album, though it's not nearly as hard rocking as fans of the older Aerosmith would expect (or perhaps want). The three singles ""Amazing,"" ""Cryin',"" and ""Crazy"" in particular seem like commercialized pop-rock. That isn't to say that I don't like them. As much as I generally hate rock that sounds like it was especially made for radio/MTV, those three songs are just too good to dislike. Then there are the other songs like ""Livin' On the Edge"" and ""Eat the Rich,"" which also got some attention and aren't too bad. Overall, while it's not nearly as rocking as the classic Aerosmith stuff, it's perhaps just as good."
4,Another solid album from Aerosmith.,"Aerosmith hits the charts once again with ""Livin' on the edge"", ""Crying"", ""Crazy"" and ""Amazing"". There is also some great pure rock dynamite songs, like ""Eat the rich"", the energetic ""Fever"" and you have a couple of so-so songs like ""Flesh"" or ""Gotta love it"" but overall, this is a pretty good release by the band."
3,Getting worse...,"Wonderful reminiscence of the young Aerosmith playing R&B and power rock has colapsed since ""Permanent Vacation"" and was completely destroyed by that Steven's burp in ""Eat the Rich"".In ""Intro"" Aerosmith tries some Rap with Walk This Way riffs. One ballad in this album is just like ""What It Takes"" in ""Pump"". Songs in this album are either ""not creative"" or ""unique but bad sense"". 80s 90s Aerosmith albums are just darn noisy. Their live is, however, still pretty good."
2,Not the best they've done.,"This CD sucks! There's only 3 fairly good songs on it. ""Livin' On The Edge"", ""Cryin'"", & ""Crazy"". I'm just glad I have other CD's to listen to when I'm bored."
2,really a 2 1/2 star review...,"I give this 2 1/2 stars...why?...well, the ballads are ultra cheesy, and there are about 5 of em...and the songs that aren't ballads...don't rock at all, and really are just filler...only a minute amount of tracks stand out...""Eat the Rich"", ""Shut up and Dance"", ""Line Up"", ""Livin' on the Edge"" stand out on the album....."
5,"All-Clad LTD 8"" fry pan","My wife loved this at our daughter's house, so we knew before ordering she would be fully satisfied with the pan, which she is. Primary usage is for cooking breakfast eggs (3 days a week) -- but obviously other things also."
1,HAVE A SIMILAR PRODUCT,"I PURCHASED ANOTHER BRAND JUST LIKE THIS. PAID $6.00 OR $7.00 FOR IT AT WORLD MARKET, COLUMBUS, OH. NEVER DID WORK. YOU COULD BURN A STEAK AND IT WOULD STILL READ RARE!"
4,Useful,This is an enlightening book nice patterns you need a little beading knowledge but can do most any thing in it
5,Love the patterns,"This book is great for authentic Native American beadwork! It shows you the patterns & tells you what tribe it's from. What's even better is that in the front cover it notates where you can see the pieces in the museum! It comes in black & white, so print copies! That way, if desired you can play with the colors."
2,Started out happy,"The product arrived exactly as described, we plugged it in and it charged our drill's battery. However, we have since noticed that it has stopped working. It is supposed to have a red light that lights when the battery is inserted (this lets you know that it is working). The light went out, and we soon realized that it was no longer charging."
2,Ryobi 12V charger fix,"My original Ryobi charger went south, but I love the drill. An easy fix is as follows. I unplugged the charger and removed the bottom cover then attached my car battery charger (12V) to the charger terminals underneath the Ryobi charger (check power cord wires for +/- location). Put the Ryobi battery back in the charger unit and trickle charge the battery that way. Remember to not use the Ryobi power cord, the car battery charger is supplying the juice."
2,Should I keep the battery in the charger,"My first charger blew, so I ordered this charger from Amazon. It blew also. I am keeping the battery in the charger plugged in. Maybe that not what I should be doing. Am ordering my third one. Home Depot does not stock these..only 18V chargers"
3,Not good with older batteries !!,"Do not use with OLD batteries. If your charger died & your batteries are over a year old, save yourself some money and just get a new drill or whatever. Buying this charger will be a waste."
1,Did not work!!,This product did not work as designed. After I placed the battery on the charger it blew out again and wouldn't work.
1,Not charging and fails within 6 months,"not good, it didn't work not even for 6 months. Not charging my battery and some defect on this product"
1,Awful product!,Same problem as others. Charger will blow out when your battery goes bad. I've gone through 3 chargers and 6 batteries so far. I would never buy another Ryobi product except that I really like the hedge clipper that I got with the drill and cannot find a comparable replacement. Once I do I will scrap all of my Ryobi tools!
1,2nd charger just died,terrible product. learning the hard way that you CAN NOT LEAVE THIS UNIT PLUGGED IN INDEFINITELY. I've sunk $20 into this system and it looks like I'll have to sink another $20 or buy a different system. I'm going to look at option #2 now...
1,"Junk when they made them, truly Junk now","You get what you pay for.Was on off-site, out-of-town job. Needed an extra drill/driver. Thought I give Ryobi a try. It was cheap. Lasted a week before battery charger went.NOT WORTH the trouble to return. Don't waste your money.When a company makes a product this lousy, they know it and when buying any tool, I'd bypass Ryobi."
1,Died less than 2 weeks after purchase.,"I bought this to replace the original charger, which finally gave up the ghost after 4 years of continuous service. This charger died less than 2 weeks after plugging it in. I wrote the seller, Mowtownusa, and explained the situation and asked what to do, but I never received a reply (this was a couple of weeks ago). I've decided to give up and buy a new one next year; can't afford to throw away any money this year. Ryobi Charger 1411141"
1,Died after charging the second battery. JUNK!,"Ryobi Charger 1411141Despite the fact that most of the reviews here for this charger are negative and from people complaining that the charger died on them, I had a perfectly-working 12V Ryobi drill with good batteries but a bad charger, so I figured I roll the dice.Complete waste of money. I have two batteries and it charged each one of them once before dying. Honestly, if you have a 12V Ryobi tool and you require this charger, just throw the tool away since it seems to be impossible to purchase a working charger."
1,review of ryobi charger,i received this charger on the tuesday after memorial day. i plugged it in to see if it worked and it did. on the following friday i had two batteries to charge and i plugged it in again and it worked for about twenty minutes and it quit. i would have complained and sent it back but it would probably cost more money than it is worth. so i don't think too much of the charger.
1,Ryobi Charger,"I recieve the charger it was in good shape. Iplug it in and plug a battery in it it would not charge the battery. I will never,never,purchase any thing from this web site again."
2,Hopeful,"Last one burned out, giving it one more try.Directions for checking batteries before using are a pain in theneck. If they can't make a better product, they should quit!"
1,Charger Failure,"The charger was received very quickly. However, it burned out minutes after I plugged it in as the old one. The Ryobi chargers and batteries are deficient. I will never buy another Ryobi product again. Didn't want to hassle of returning it. Went out and bought a new drill."
1,worst battery charger in the cordless industry,"I have a ryobi model 1202m cordless drill. In order to charge the battery #1311148 you need the charger #1411141. This charger will fail on the second or third charge cycle you utilize. I have gone through 4 chargers now. I finally gave up on the ryobi and purchased a milwaukee 18v drill. This product works great, charges the batteries in 20 to 30 minutes and the charger has not failed in over 100 charging cycles. I will never again buy a ryobi product."
1,Didn't work,Purchased a replacement charger only to discover it is defective and did not produce a charge. Guess that's the price you pay for the online purchase.Not sure why Ryobi charger is so difficult to find.
1,Make sure the drill model and the charger model are compatible!!,I ordered the wrong one and it is NOT RETURNABLE. They clam to have advised on the page. Unpleasant overall. The large print giveth and the small print taketh away. Grumble.
1,Products defective,Two chargers were purchased with one no longer working after two days; the other quit working in less than a week. I'm very disappointed in these products and will not purchase any other items from this company.
1,Do Not Purchase this item!!!,"I never even got to get one entire charged battery from this item, and it had died. These are terrible chargers...not worth anything...a waste of time and money...junk!!!"
1,"I was warned, but I ignored the warnings...","I should have listened. This is a zero star item.The charger worked for about 5 minutes before frying. Amazon will take it back with no hassle, so hooray for Amazon. But now I'll be throwing away a perfectly good drill, a hand held vacuum, and 2 batteries, just because Ryobi can't seem to make a battery charger that can, you know, charge batteries. Lame."
2,Should of payed more attention to the reviews,"I did purchased the Ryobi 141141 and like the many reviews it worked for excactlyfive minutes when the red light went out I would not recommend this charger to anyone and pay attention to the reviews, I always put my charger on a timer but in this case it did not do any good"
1,Don't buy this,"This product was horrible. After reading the reviews - It seemed as all customers had troubles with this charger when they bought it. In spite of the reviews, my wife still convinced me to buy this charger saying it was worth the risk. Wow - what a mistake. The charger did EXACTLY what all of the other customer reviews said it would to. I plugged it in and within 5 minutes it stopped working. Now I'll by a new drill after wasting money. Don't make the mistake like me and waste your money. Customer reviews are there for a reason."
1,Battery Charger Defective,"This was the third charger that I ordered and the third one that turned out to be defective. Not sure if it is the age, workmanship (rebuilt?) or just bad luck. I may be slow, but I finally figured out it's time to buy a new drill!"
1,Don't buy,Do not buy this product.Before charging even one battery completely and before 3 hours had elapsed the charger went dead.Stay away
1,dosn't charge....nothing happens when battery is put into charger,"this thing doesn;t charge, i plugged it in and insert battery and nothing happens.....no red light, no charge, now i think the battery is shot..geeeezzz"
5,fine after I received the second one I ordered,It took me 2 e-mails to the company before I got a confirmation that the second charger was on it's way. They said it was a picking error.
1,"good vendor, crappy product",This product ceased functioning during the first charge. It is absolute junk. I haven't returned it yet so I can't say how the vendor is.
3,Ryobi charger,"The charger worked, but a bad battery shorted it out. I tried to figure out how to see if the battery was okay, but the places that they recommended like Napa and Auto Zone did not know either."
1,Don't waste your money,"My first one, which came with my cordless drill, died. I bought a replacement. It died. I will just buy a new cordless drill from a different manufacturer and save the future hassle."
4,compassionate insights,Mrs. Bender offers an insight to the struggles of coping with Parkinson's disease. The book is poetic and powerful.
1,Beach Boys Special Edition is not so special,"This was totally disappointing. We wanted a dvd that we could put on and have it repeat continuously, this one can't do it. It is the craziest thing I have ever seen. Would not buy another Beach Boys DVD for fear it would be the same, unfortunately, we bought two at the same time. Both are equally bad."
2,Beach Boys DVD,What a nice DVD The sound in DTS was out of this world. I just wish I was alive when the Beach Boys started out. If you like this DVD you will love Pet Sounds on DVD Audio.
1,Conspiracy is right,"My grandfather was Frank P. O'Neill, one of the ""white collar criminals"" talked about in this book. I can tell you that in truth it's 90% bulls#@!. It is, however, an entertaining read. This writer was a loon, who made up a good story. My grandfather may have been an unconventional guy, but he's not some super criminal mastermind, and neither is anyone else from this book. They're just people. And that Edward guy who's ""the son of one of the criminals"" sounds like he's just trying to profit off of a fairytale."
3,Master of Magic,"This is a book about Harry Houdini. Harry Houdini grew up with four brothers and one sister. He is famous for escaping safes, handcuffs and walking on tightropes. He was introduced to magic at the age of seven. On his journey Harrry Houdini became one of the most famous magicians in the world.Houdini performed for more than one million people in his lifetime. After his greatest trick he passed away.I do not think this was a good book because it did not have a lot of information about Harry Houdini. Also, it did not tell when or where Harry Houdini was born. There were some confusing words. I would recommend this book as a good story but not for school use."
3,"Great to see Greyhawk return, but this isn't the best start","I'm an avid fan of the Greyhawk setting so it pains me to say I am a little dissappointed in this new module. The main flaw is that it is completely scripted and leaves little room for the alteration that most modules require. The NPC's are extremely powerful and even the encounters are so over powered it is hard to change them to work in a less magic filled campaign. I always thought it was a lame fabrication that a member of the Circle of Eight could be killed and every clone destroyed. Just not possible. I was glad to see an official reversal of this even if only slightly. I liked the castle design and would love to see designs for the residences of others of the Circle of Eight in the future (with accompanying plot lines). Overall I'm glad to add another Greyhawk module to my game collection. I hope following modules will have similar plots ideas, but be more free and open about how events must occur and what events must occur."
2,It warps after a few uses,We enjoyed this pan until it warped. Now the bottom is slightly rounded and heats unevenly. The non-stick surface is still OK.
2,Disappointed,"With this rough winter in NJ, I am not grilling outside as I usually would, so, replacing a 15 year old grill pan, I thought I was ordering the best. This pan is heavy; it is not a one-handed pan. I put 3 very thinly sliced, marinated chicken breasts in it, picked it up with one hand it it ROCKS & TEETERS back & forth like a seesaw. If I had thick steaks in the pan, they would have landed on the floor. It needs an extra ""crescent handle"" on the side opposite the main handle to give it stability for lifting. My entire cooktop was covered with grease, the little bit of remaining marinade on the chicken splattered all over the place. Perhaps the pan should be deeper? A total mess! I'm going to try it again, but if I have to clean my entire cooktop and adjacent counters again I will not be happy."
4,"Cooks great, but not really nonstick","This is a great pan and at the sale price it's also a tremendous value. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. It cooks beautifully, heats evenly, and stands up to use in the oven. The only thing negative I can say about it is that it doens't really live up to the claim of being nonstick. It's not hard to clean, but I have a Calphalon nonstick skillet that you can literally just run water into to clean. You don't even have to dry it beacuse the water won't stick to it! The All-Clad doesn't quite manage that, but is still a remarkable pan at an awesome price."
5,Best instrumental CD for anytime!,"I was one of those people who cried when this show ended. Snuffy is profound in his style, and his musical choices for episodes were perfect. I hear the tunes and I remember the episodes. I listen while playing with my kids, then I sit back and watch my kids as I cry through most of the tracks.I cannot speak more highly of a CD that everyone should have in there collection. Buy this CD and listen to it in the car as your driving through cornfields on either side of the highway. The dull scenery comes to life."
4,Original impeller replacement,I bought this impeller as a precaution as the old one was over 11 years old which means it lasted that long with engine oil changes annually. Good thing I did too because in the original intallation the worker didn't bother to put the gasket in the right place; the gasket was behind the impeller and not on the rim of the pump !! the intaller must've been half asleep or just didn't care !! who knows ?? it's a wonder the pump didn't leak during pump out !!
5,Great compilation; Great Dance Hits!!!,"I heard one song from this album on a local radio station. I bought it never knowing what to expect. I should have known that any DJ with an ability to choose one good song can usually duplicate the effort. ""Fabric 24"" does not fail in bringing the funky grooves. I listened to this in my car because the accoustics are so good. I could not help from dancing in the car. This CD will definitely give you a positive vibe after listening to it. If you like House music, then this CD is a must have. You will appreciate 10 of the 17 songs for sure. You may even like all 17. Listen to the previews, and then know that they don't even do the CD justice. It's that much better!!"
2,Touch Lamp or Switch Lamp?,"I ordered 2 of these lamps at separate times. The first one I received was a touch 3-way lamp and the second one I received was a 1-way switch lamp. I really wanted a matching set of touch lamps. They need to tell you what product you are actually buying, as apparently, they just ship whichever one they choose to.Both of the lamps look good and work well though."
2,Yawn,"Wow, a whole book of red sox fans talking about being red sox fans - some, no doubt, even in the offseason. A more narcissistic bunch of sports fans could hardly be imagined - their constant yapping makes me want to weep and vomit simultaneously and ""unparallelled suffering""? Cry me a river, meatheads."
5,"Very enjoyable, with surprises.","I recommend this highly. Very clever, funny - well done! (I won't go into plot details - others have, already.) (Some reviewers here should be SHOT for giving away the important plot details!)The reviewers who have told the plot details should have their reviews REMOVED by Amazon. Reviewers who give away plot details should not be allowed to write comments/reviews on Amazon. They ruin the film for others, by telling too much."
5,Linus + Roache = Great Cinema!,"This is just another great film by Linus Roache. His wife is killed in a freak space debris accident. He gets depressed, and wins a trip to Australia, and discovers life all over again. It is a quirky trail with some not so average tourists on a bus trip through the Australian continent. He meets a woman and eventually falls for her. They buy a place to run and settle in the hot desert Outback of Australia. The film is full of funny incidents, and twists. You get to see more of why thespian Linus Roache is a favorite of mine."
3,movie dvd,"Not happy with it,it kept hesitating through the whole movie, but you get what you pay for."
1,so awful!,"this is the worst music you will ever hear. i saw these guys last week at a system of a down concert, and man, were they just loud and boring. no musical talent whatesover. stay clear of them!!!!!!!!!"
2,not so great,"Like many others I saw Bad Acid Trip on tour with SOAD and TMV. I thought they were alright live and they reminded me of tubring (one of my favorite bands) so after their set I bought lynch the weirdo. I must say that this CD is quite bad. its fairly boring, untalented, repetitive and just overall bad. maybe I just expected too much but I really don't like this album. a couple songs are alright but i wouldnt recommend buying this cd."
3,Iowa,"A great follow up to the original self titled album ""Slipknot"" unfortunatly doesnt quite meet the standards of the first or latest ""Subliminal Verses"" album. I would reccomend this album to those interested in fast heavy music, but if you havent yet heard the first in my opinion is the best buy!"
5,Grind your face off with a cheese grater!,"I've seen these guys live like 6 times and Dirk & the boys never let you down! I first was introduced to B.A.T back when I bought the Blllleeeeaaaauuuurrrrrgggggghhhhh! 7inch compilation on Chris Dodge's (the ledgendary powerviolence band SPAZZ)record label Slap-A-Ham. I got into them and purchased their record ""Remember"" and I was blown away. I heard some ass call them ""System of A Down"" rip-off's but this is far from the truth! They have known System before they got big and are good friends. Plus Daron produced ""Lynch the Weirdo"" so there was a lot of collaboration there. Lynch the Weirdo is amazing! All the speed and brutality plus the slow parts just to catch your breath before the next blast beat rips out your spine! GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!!! ALL SYNONYMS OF BRUTAL APPLY!"
4,fucking brutal,"Lots of people are bashing this band and whinning. They must be used to Linkin park or Kenny Rogers. This band destroys you in half, the vocals are sick and brutal. Dont listen to the wimps, this band will blow you to smitherins. Saw them yesterday in Florida, much better than Mars Volta, infact, what is that band doing with SOAD?? They sound like a bad mexican cantina band. This band rules and will become popular and then all these cry babys will start loving them. They just havent been on a Reality show or mtv yet, so they dont like them."
2,Batmobile w/veil technology,"Neat car, but not sure if they are not using the veil technology on the cartoon any longer or if I did not use it properly. I have an hdtv and it states it cannot be used with hdtv but I tivo the show then play it back my hdtv is a crt tv thought that would make it ok. Not the case if you have a regular tv it is suppose to work have not tried it on that one though the show is on very late. Directions are not very easy to understand maybe a child under 10 would do better than me?"
1,ugg,Tried one box. Turned out terrible. It stuck together into one big clump. Tried another box. This time I put some oil in the water with hopes that it would keep it seperate. Didn't work. If anyone has tried this and knows how please let me know.
5,FANTASTIC PRODUCT!,"After trying a few products of Pasta Corn Spaghetti... IMHO this is the best you will find for the price. I have tried Mrs. Fields brand and less expensive brands from grocery store, and De Boles has excellent taste and cooks well. I have found what I was looking for in this superb product. When I have friends over for spaghetti... they ask about the pasta brand. Must be a reason."
2,mediocre at best,"I suppose if you can not find any other GF pasta, this will do, but IMHO the texture & taste is not nearly as good as other brands I have tried, incl Schar, Tinkyada, and especially not as good as PastaMia (by Heinz). I will not buy this brand again."
2,Not as good as Mrs Leeper's,"I thought this was the same stuff I had purchased before, but actually, I had been buying Mrs Leeper's Corn Pasta. The De Boles stuff is okay, but not great. My wife and I find that Mrs Leepers is easier to cook, has a nicer texture (less likely to come out pasty) and a stronger corn taste (which I like, but others may not). In the future, we'll go back to ordering Mrs Leeper's, but I would say it's a matter of taste, not an inferior product per se (it's not like we'll be throwing this away, we just won't reorder)."
3,Selling Used As New,"This book was purchased under the impression that it was NEW. I paid the NEW price for it, and yet somehow a used book arrived at my door. This was a direct from AMAZON purchase and not with an affilate. So i guess you may not even trust that Amazon will tell you the truth about the condition of an item."
3,Cutting Edge Music,"Mira is a fantastic Basist;He is so good, it is hard for most of us to get it; and he is a bit bored with us too, which is too bad. This DVD is essential for the Vitous fan, or anyone into any kind of Bass music. I hope Mirek can get enthused about bebop again, I love his music, and it comes so easy to him, but he really should learn to play with others, form a trio, have a good time, be himself. This DVD is an important document about how the Muse posesses and animates a willing priest of the mantra, and let there be no doubt this music is mantra."
2,Strictly for childer,"This is not something to buy if you want to learn how to play bass. The DVD lasts for about 10 minutes and it is simply an interview with three teenagers who try to persuade you how you should play bass if you want to get into music. The commputer CD that comes with it is geared towards absolute beginner, and tailored to kids. The best think in the whole set is the little booklet that has the scales in it, but that's about it. This may be a nice gift to a 13-year old, but skip it if you're an adult or if you already know what a string or a note is."
1,baaadddddddd,this is a great advertisement but as a teaching tool it sucks. I think it is a waste of money do NOT waste yours. drop me a mail i will give you mine for free. POS Amazon was great it did not come with the book so they did not charge me. I think I still wasted my time. crap.
1,These things suck!,"I bought these b/c i read good reviews on it...totally was not satisfied. I have a 01 toyota tacoma and I live in Mammoth Lakes, CA. Dumped pretty hard last winter... these things were difficult to put on, and when you drive down the road with them they are super loud (louder than chains) and I had worse control than I did w/o them!They're probably good for a road that hasn't been plowed or for mud wamping. I was driving on a plowed highway and it was terrible! Returned them right away."
5,added to my collection,this was a hard piece to find. apparently may be a discontinued item; get it while you can. excellent piece in non stick. thoroughly pleased.
3,"nice, but too small","This is a nice pan, but as a saute pan it is simply too small. Makes a nice sauce pan though."
4,A gem by a realitively unknown author,"I actually picked up this book thinking it was authored by Chaim Potok. When I brought it home from the library, I very nearly did not read it due to my disappointment of it's authorship. However, after scanning the jacket of the book I decided to read at least the beginning. To make a long story short I ended up finishing the book the same day which I started it. It turned out to have a similar theme from one of Chaim Potok's books, namely a Jewish artist, who goes against his familiy's wishes and becomes a success in the world of art. I was very surprised at how the words just flew off the pages and led the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Now my biggest disappointment is that, apparently, this is but one of two works that the author ever wrote."
5,outstanding lubricant,This is my first experience with this product. It is an excellent lubricant and lasts longer than others I have used.
5,My fav!!!!,My favs slide lubricating product! Easy to use as it does not require the two step application of the two seperate containers of Slide-O-Mix and work just a good.
3,Heavy mattress with some workmanship issues,"Other reviewers have lavished praise on this mattress. Mine is a little more reserved perspective.This product is made with less than premium materials, as can be expected from its price. The outer covering is essentially camping grade tarp. Those who like a smoother feel to their fabric may end up disappointed. Stitching is loose in many places, although it does not appear to affect the integrity of the seams. The sheer bulk of the mattress dominates the elbow rests. Despite all this bulk, however, you can still feel the futon slats through it.Verdict: adequate mattress for the price."
1,I'm not sure,"I'm not sure who is writing all the other reviews, but I purchased this mattress for my daughter in March 09. It was purchased to lay on top of a black steel full-size bed frame. My daughter, who is a mere 110, lbs did complain to me that it wasn't very comfortable. When I went to visit her this summer, I slept in the bed. It was terrible. I could feel all the bars from the bed frame! It was VERY uncomfortable. What a waste of money. I would not recommend this mattress - Premier Futon Mattress - I don't think so."
2,Spend the extra $30 and go elsewhere.,"I narrowed down my purchase to this mattress and one other (on Amazon.com). I went the less expensive route and purchased this mattress for my child's futon-loftbed combo. The cover is very thin and I do not expect it to wear well. It is loosely tied. It is approximately seven inches thick as described, but I can feel the slats underneath the mattress already (I am of average weight for a grown adult male). It appears to be a recycled material inside. I took the risk of going the cheaper route and I do regret it. I bet we'll be replacing this mattress within three years if it's used regularly.On a different note it was packaged appropriately. It arrived in a very timely fashion. The mattress unpacked easily and was ready for use within minutes.If you do decide to purchase this I strongly urge you to avoid the ""beige"" color. It is more of a dirty white than a beige color and there isn't anything that matches it."
3,Don't Forget It's A Futon Matress,"This item was shipped very poorly -- rolled up in twine and wrapped in a sheet of plastic. The plastic had grease smeared on it in several places. The plastic was also ripped up in several places and dirt had stained the mattress in the holes that had been ripped. Thankfully none of the grease was inside any of the rips.It's a very comfortable mattress, but it isn't nearly as thick as it looks in the product picture, and even after a week of usage I can tell it will wear out sooner or later.This is still the best quality mattress you can get for the price... just don't think you'll be getting more than what you're paying for."
2,"Human years, Dog years, Mattress years!!!","If 1 human year is 7 dog years, then 1 human year is 65 Mattress years. You see, this mattress began to sag soon after I purchased it... This leaves the top of the ""prison bar"" frame exposed. This is a low quality mattress... BUT...the price was right and it is comfortable. So I would not put this in my living room, but for a spare room or computer room it is fine."
3,Decent mattress - Worth the money,"THis is a decent mattress worth the price. I feel more comfortable on this than the other branded expensive mattress I have in my bed room. Prompt delivery by the merchant. The only complaint I have is that this mattress is not foldable in the center. For the price and quality, there really is not much of a cons."
5,Very Good,"It is very comfortable though heavy. As of now, I cannot say about the quality. Time will say about the quality."
5,Futon,"Very pleased with this purchase. It arrived early, and is better than expected. It is well padded and well stitched. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to replace their futon mattress."
4,Awesome mattress!!,"I love my new mattress. Its a beautiful Black color. Its amazing at this kind of a price. I bought it from bargain outfitters website though. Over here they do not show the size options. Also, they take almost 15-20 days to ship. Ill get another one soon. Highly Recommended!!"
2,Attractive but not soft,"I have have had this futon mattress for awhile now, so i can say i gave it fair chance before rating. It looks attractive, but it is not at all as comfortable as they claimed. I have had to buy two, 2 inch or so topper mattresses to go on it just to make it comfortable enough to sleep on thru the night. If you want it for just sitting, thats ok; but for company to sleep on, not so ok!"
2,....Just OK,"I was really excited to recieve this mattress in the mail after all the postive reveiws. But to be perfectly honest I do not think it is anything special. I have been sleeping on it for a week hoping to break it in before my sister visits. It is very heavy and firm.... it is firm to the point where I find it uncomfortable to sleep on...OK to sit on...but deffinitly not ""COMFY"". Also I can feel the futon rails through the mattress when I am sleeping on it. Unlike other reviewers I don't find that it slips or moves around, though I think a non slip pad would be an easy fix for that problem. Hopefully I can break it in before my sister gets here. If not, I think I will just run out and find a pillow top for the mattress. Hope this helps."
3,Looking for softness,This product look so nice and soft which it is but when it's on medal for the futon a while you could feel the medal but it's not so bad.
2,Size not clear,I started a search for a twin sized futon. This was one of the options that showed up in the search and it was the best price and shipping. I didn't look at the dimensions because I thought a twin was a twin. When the futon showed up it was a FULL SIZE FUTON. I contacted the seller and they pointed out the dimensions that appeared lower in the advertisement and told me that the fault was with Amazon.com's search process. I did contact them and they emailed a return label. Also...the futon arrived vacuum wrapped in plastic but the plastic tore and the futon was soiled in that area. Not the best of packaging options.
1,Not so natural,"I despise companies and brands that use the words ""Natural"" and ""Eco-Friendly"" to try and lure people into purchases. From the description, it seems none of this product is sustainably crafted or produced with any environmentally friendly standards. Exploiting peoples care for the environment is ridiculous, stop it."
1,bad bad bad bad,did not order this color ordered the natural reordered when customer service was supposed to cancel the black mattress then recieved e mail stating thst both black and natural was shipped from factory refused shipment on black mattress and was sent back to wharehouse I am still waiting for my credit from Amazon will not ever buy from this site again
1,Notice.....,notice that the reviews from 2007 are all good and the ones from 2011 are all bad??? i'd say this is a sure case of deteriorating quality... i decided against it!
1,Frusterated,I ordered a twin size matress and it came in full so I called so that I could return it. They said they would send a shipping label. I have been waiting for over two weeks now. I called to check the status and the lady was very rude. I called back today and the lady was nicer and she said that she would resend the label.
2,Our guests are NOT fans of this mattress,"While I have never slept on the futon mattress myself, we've had guests spend the night on multiple occasions, and they always come out of the guest room the next morning looking bleary-eyed and restless. Whenever we ask them about how the futon is, they get a bit shifty and nervously respond, ""Oh, it was okay i guess..."".To be fair, we never had any problems using the futon upright as a couch, but apparently this mattress is NOT meant for sleeping on, at least not if you want to sleep well..."
2,Not as comfortable as I was expecting,It's lumpy and you can feel the bars but for the price I guess what can you expect. I wish it would have been more comfy but it's to much work to return so we'll just keep it and hopefully find something better along the line
4,Very nice mattress,"I needed a bed when husband and I moved and decided to have separate bedrooms (that's working out beautifully, BTW! :). I couldn't spend a lot of money and this really IS a good mattress. My problem is, I weigh 300 lbs. and futons are made for teeny-tiny people; my weight has taken a toll on the mattress's loft. It's great for short term use, but I'm thinking I'd be more comfortable on a *real* mattress."
4,Great futon mattress,This futon mattress is incredibly comfortable and just the right thickness. It fits perfectly onto my full size frame. The only downside is that it slides down a bit but that could be because it's brand new and isn't used that much.
1,Premier? Who are they trying to kid?,"This was TOTALLY not worth the money. It was thin and got lumpy quick, little better than the cheap mattress I got with my futon. And I had to wait SO LONG for the darn thing to be delivered. It was a disappointment all the way around."
4,futon mattress,"i really like the futon mattress. for the deal i got, its really good. no complaints :D"
2,Good price,"I bought this product for its price to replace of a very old futon. That was full of dust mites and orange in color. Its quality is all right, but it is rather thin, and I wished I would have gotten a thicker one"
4,Comfiest thing imaginable for the first three months,"As mattresses go, I can swear by this one. It delivered fast and without hassle, it was obscenely comfortable, it fit the frame we have perfectly, and the price could not be beaten. I could not be happier with it.The only downside (and the sole reason for my four star rating) is that a few months along it has already lost some of its fluffiness. It is by no means in the condition of the mattress it replaced, but the constant up and down of a group of ~200 lb. guys using it as a couch during the day has rendered it merely comfortable and not a divine surface of sleep inducing glory."
4,Decent mattress for the price,"I've been using this futon mattress regularly for about a month. The quality is decent for the price. It is much softer than more expensive futon mattress probably because this mattress is less dense. It is a bit too soft for my preference, but it works fine as a futon sofa for occasional guests."
3,Good mattress but shipping takes for ever!,"I finally have my new mattress and I have to say it is SUPER comfy.Although i had to wait more than a month to receive it. While it is advertised as 1-2 weeks shipment on Amazon, Bargain outfitters guarantee a 1-4 weeks shipment and refuse to keep you updated with your order before the 4 weeks have gone through! As I had not received my item within 4 weeks, I had to call them every day for a week before they announced me that the vendor had lost my order and the order needed to be replaced! The customer service was far from always being nice and helpful. I would not take the chance to order from them again."
4,comfortable for a futon,"After reading the other reviews, I had high expectations about the mattress's comfort level. It wasn't as comfortable as I imagined it. I took a nap on it and the comfort level was sub par. However, its pretty decent considering its a futon. Just don't think that you can replace a good bed with it."
3,not thick enough,"delivery was very prompt. mattress arrived in perfect condition fit was true to size with a few inches smaller than futon. Bought a cover to go over this mattress, glad I did, because of its color it really looked like a bare mattress.I just feel the mattress should have been a lot thicker. The moment I sat on it, It felt hard. Its ok for the basement & for the teenagers, but if you were using it as a bed you would definately need a thicker softer mattress."
5,a great deal and comfortable,"The futon arrived in a heavy duty shipping bag (which made it easy to drag into the house). There was no damage to the packaging or the product. I set it up on the futon frame and am very pleased. For the price, this is a great product. It is comfortable and folds into the couch position with no problem.This is, in my opinion, a perfect mattress for the futon couch in the spare room. I even fell asleep on it. Would I sleep on it every night? No but then again, it is 99 bucks! I used to sell futons 20 years ago. The $99 price point that I sold was of way lesser quality than this futon."
1,sleep on concrete,i realize that cheaper is usually bad but this had good reviews. DON'T BELIEVE IT it left me with painful back trouble no kidding
4,Great Futon Mattress,Thicker than most and a much better price! Highly recommend but be prepared to wait a month for delivery.
4,futon matress,"Very nice and comfortable. It does seem that the string pieces, which serve as cushion buttions, looks like they wiil cause the whole to fray over time. Otherwise, I am happy with this product. It was also delivered within a reasonable time-frame."
2,Seasoned internet buyer scalded with no-lid trick ! ! !,"Yep, After many years of successful purchases on the internet and Amazon in particular I have been slipped a fast one by the company who sells this item . . . As you can see from the other reviews, I bought this as a gift and there was NO LID in it when opened on Chrismas morning !!! very disappointing! !"
2,NO LID,The pan is just what I expected but was very disappointed that there was no lid. The web pape was very misleading.
2,short lived,"My relatively new, relatively little used Sony DVP-NS575P will no longer play discs -- they'll load but not spin; the first time this happened I was able to fix it temporarily by removing the cover and kick starting the disc with my finger, but that method no longer works. Going online, I see that I can send mine in and Sony will replace it with a refurbished machine for about 50% more, all told, than the the price of a new one. Hello?!?!So discouraging, the lousy design/build quality of so many consumer goods these days, and that includes expensive items (see: Maytag washers)."
1,Stopped working,"After a year of very gentle use (in a research lab, maybe 1/week), the unit stopped reading all disks."
4,Works fine,This was reputed to play beat up Netflix discs better than others. I've only had a couple of skips and not refusals to play since I started using it. It indeed plays discs that will gag my old Phillips player. I don't see a difference in picture quality.
4,DVD Player,"For a reasonable price, our Sony DVP-NS57P/B Progressive-Scan DVD Player is a fine DVD player. Let's just hope that it lasts longer than our previous DVD player or at least until we move up to a high definition unit."
4,Great player for the $$$,"If you are looking for an inexpensive player, this is a great choice. After buying an off brand at a nationwide store, which broke after three plays, I bought this DVD player from Sony on Amazon and it works just fine. Standard shipping was fast and obviously the DVD player arrived in excellent condition."
1,What a peice.,"Save up your money for a better player.This machine wouldn't play a disc with a hairline scratch on it. I was getting fed up with this machine BEFORE it broke.Then it broke.I hit the eject button to open the tray, I heard a click, then what sounded like the motor slowing down, then a loud POP.The track broke off of the tray because the teeth on the gear and the track were misaligned. I called Sony to see if I could just buy a new optical drive, and I could, but it would cost $90.. I was like ""The drive costs more than the player?"" and they were like ""yes""Needless to say I have a new DVD Player now. And its much nicer.Save up for something above $60.. you won't regret it."
2,14 months then dead,"This player was only $50, and I got 14 months out of it, so it's not a big loss. And when it worked, it worked well--playing just about everything I threw at it. But it turned out to basically be a piece of junk, which I don't expect from Sony at any price point. A few days ago it just stopped mounting DVDs. The discs were being spun, but nothing more. My cheapie Cyberhome and Presidian players have lasted much longer. My Toshiba lasted 7 years. This sony appears to be out of production now, which is just fine. I'll be trying out another brand for my next player. Shame on you Sony."
2,Lasted less than a year,"Bought this DVD player last summer when our previous DVD player of 8+ years finally bit the dust. Worked great, easy set up. Loved the fact that the remote let us control the volume on our TV, unlike our previous very old model. However, as of yesterday it simply stopped working. No warnings, just not working.I realize that we didn't pay too much for the thing, but I would expect that from a name like Sony we'd at least get a couple years out of it. Apparently having the name Sony on something doesn't mean quality any more."
1,Do you wanna get $70 1080p ?,"you get what you pay for.... really no good for 1080p upscale. Save a bit more $ and buy a decent upscale 1080p like Denon, Yamaha, Pioneer or Marantz..."
1,Never Worked,"I just bought one of these, brought it home, hooked it up and tried any number of clean DVDs that work fine on other players. None of them worked. The display said either ""NO DISK"" or ""CANNOT PLAY"".Maybe some of these work great, but their quality control must not be very strict or this one never would have left the factory.I selected a Sony because I expected a high standard of quality. Why spend the extra $30 for a name brand if it's just as likely a waste of an afternoon as some generic crap from Daewoo or Apex?"
4,Sony DVD,Nice affordable DVD player...good quality as should be expected from Sony. I havent had it long but so far it has played all of my dvds and cds. Good value.
4,good,"works like it should. no sleep function. zoom buttons and slow motion with sound button. good features. slow loading, but no problems once it's running.good for a cheap dvd player. might be worth spending more on a better version."
1,Worked for maybe 3 DVDs,After a few days the player would no longer power on. Have to return for replacement.
1,Did not deliver the sony quality I expected,"First, I was totally surprised to see that sony had done away not only with the s-video connection, but the digital fiber (toslink) as well. This makes absolutly no sense at all. Why do away with the best audio connection available (excluding hdmi) and leave digital coax. Which brings me to my next complaint. When hooking this dvd player up to a SONY digital reciever via a digital coax cable, I get absolutly no sound what-so-ever. Way to go sony for building a dvd player with less connections that doesn't even work with your own existing equipment. I've bought and owned sony dvd players in the past, and despite my satisfaction with them, this disappointing purchase may make me switch brands for a player with more compatibility."
4,Check out Aldi!,At the moment this is on sale at Aldi for 39.99. Supplies are limited. I got the last one at my local Aldi.
3,"GOOD UNIT, POORLY DESIGNED/MADE REMOTE","Yes the ability of this unit to read/play imperfect discs is better than most, but the design, programing and functioning of the remote is poor at best. To start, the buttons on the unit are too small and are in the wrong/less than convenient positioning. The keys function slowly/poorly. The actual programming is reqiures too many steps to effect desired actions such as slow play requires hitting of pause then then slow rather than just pressing slow key to effect desired reduced speed. The .6 slow play is unique and liked."
1,Didn't last,"Player died after only 6 months of light-to-moderate use, in a household with no kids or pets."
1,Poor user interface,"I would never buy this DVD player again, even if it were only $10. The buttons on this player are very slow to respond. Sometimes I'll press the power button and it doesn't even turn on. I often have to hit a button 2 or 3 times before it works, this goes for all buttons, power, eject, etc. There is a definite lag between button depress and response --- this may not seem like that big of a deal but it really is extremely annoying. This player also will not turn off automatically. I've had previous players that will automatically power down x amount of minutes after a CD or DVD ends, not this one, it stays on, wasting energy until you manually turn it off. (And remember, you may have to hit that off button twice...)"
5,Our BEST in the house!,We own two DVD recorders and three DVD players. This one is our most reliable. It is quick and has been going strong for over two years now. My son is autistic and therefore requires a movie running 24/7. That's how much this thing gets used...awesome buy!
5,"Adding a fresh, new sound to country music...",Echotown adds a pleasant change to today's country music. You will not be disappointed with this new band's music.
5,Yummy pasta!,"This angel hair pasta cooks quickly & tastes great. Good quality ingredients make it the perfect start of a healthy dinner. We don't eat a lot of pasta these days, but this one has become our favorite. I serve it with pesto or fresh tomato sauce and a steamed green vegetable. Dinner is ready in 15 minutes!"
4,Review of G.I. Joe - The MASS Device/Revenge of Cobra,"I'm very pleased with my purchase. Arrived extremely quickly and without any surprises.The only thing that was a downside was that the DVD's will stop in the middle of playing at times. If I play the same disk again, it will still happen, but not in the same place(s), so I'm not sure if that's a reflection on my DVD player or the DVD itself. So I can't complain too much given the price and the fact that it could be my DVD player (I haven't had a chance to try it at someone else's place with a different DVD player) means I can't really hold it against the seller. I would give it 4.5 stars instead of 4 for this, but that's not allowed.So yeah, overall, very happy, only 1 complaint that may not be the sellers fault."
4,this dvd is flawed,"I'm glad to see g.i.joe on dvd it's one of my all time favorits. But the dvd is not perfect, there are no extras at all, allthough I am glad the see that they remasterd it. It still would have been nice to see some extras like some old toy comercials or at least some interviews.Maybe next time?"
2,to many CREDITS PLAYING,If your a hard core joe fan you might not mind forwarding through the ends and beganings of every 30 min episode.Its really a pain in the but and rhino should have taken care of it. they also did this with thier transformers before hand. the only up side is the qaulity of the picture since it was restored and put on a dvd.
2,Not as Described,"Book was described by Books4uny as New and it was definitely not that. Super wrapped in bubble and shrink wrap, but it was dingy and worn, very obvious it was not new. Can you spell integrity?"
1,Not recommended,"Arcane material, not conducive to making practical decisions about diet and nutrition. Seems to require long arduous scrutiny to achieve any useful result."
5,WORD-RECOGNITION FUN!!,"This is a excellent educational tool for preschoolers and adults wishing to hone their vocabulary - and a great TV-alternative.Words have to be recognized and formed from a wall of letters that get refreshed as you progress. Target-words offer extra points whereas, repeatedly forming easy small words is ""punished"" with the appearance of burning letter-tiles that, if let to reach the bottom, end the game.This is a perfect example of what has come to be known as Casual Gaming. It would be a good idea to download the 60-min trial version from a site, such as REFLEXIVE (you can Google it), and decide for yourself whether this is indeed your cup of tea.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
5,Absolutely amazing,"This book fell into my hands at the very moment that I needed. The deailed composition, the vibrant style and the ascending rythm are breathtaking from beginning to end. Later I have read other books by the same author and I did not like them very much. But this one is really out of this world."
4,This Is Real and You Are Completely Unprepared: The Days of Awe as a Journey of Transformation,I purchased the book for a book club/class I joined to discuss for the up-coming holiday.The book brings up lots of meaningful discussion and I have made some good friendships.I am thoroughly enjoying it and highly recommend.There are lots of personal anecdotes and stories that help with the understanding of concepts.
4,good product,"just what I wanted and great price, it is better for women. I had a vertical one to use at the gym but couldn't find the vertical version and apparently it is uncomfortable for men and doesn't support larger men's weight as well as a lighter woman"
4,"Good bargain, good product","Got mine today. Everything fit together, and it's basically not wobbly. For the money, it seems like a very good buy. The reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 are as follows:1) The leg pad height is adjustable, but I don't really see any reason for anything except the highest level. Furthermore, the highest level isn't quite high enough for me- it's slightly uncomfortable on my thighs. I might try to drill a higher peg hole. It's certainly useable though, and not that big a deal.2) The abdomen pad isn't the most comfortable thing overall, but it's not bad. I might just use an extra shirt or towel.That's about it. Overall, I would recommend it, especially at ~$70 with free shipping. I expect to use it quite a bit."
3,apex roman/hyper chair,"what you see is what you get. it is a good chair feels comfortable and gives great range. it is not solid enough for commercial duty but i am one guy so it will probably last me my life.the box was beat to hell though, ripped open at one end. it had been handled so ruff that the hardware package was ripped open inside and i was missing a bolt and nut and couple washers before it was over. at first i thought it was used but the strapping and internal packaging were all intact. only the hardware bundle was free to move around in there so it got caught on a metal edge and ripped open. i did not complain because after i bought 1.10 worth of hardware the bench went together fine and i have been using it daily. i am very happy with it."
4,Good for your money,The only thing I wish it didnt do was wobble a little. Other than that its easy to put together and I love it.
3,It's OK for the price,"I bought this bench not realizing how high off the ground it is. I am 5' 2"", so I literally have to jump down off this bench. The more expensive ones have you at a different angle so you are not so high off the ground, and they have a foot plate. I wish I would have bought the more expensive one. The only reason I kept it is because it works, and it's a pain to send something like this back."
5,SOLID,"An incredibly solid piece of gear for the money. A very tall person might have problems with their head getting too close to the ground, but I'm 6' and have no issues. If I swing too fast, the leg end will come up a tiny bit, but it is not loose and I don't feel as though it would ever tip. For the price, you can not do any better."
3,Good Machine,Great product. It doesn't include any information on what exercises to perform or what benefit it is for people. I used them before and already know which ones are best
3,toxic seat?,"My product arrived in good shape and could be assembled fairly easily using the pictures as instructions. The price was good, as was the super saver free shipping. However, the seat or rather thigh rest really smelled horrible. I wondered if it were toxic. The ""Made in China"" notice made me decide to take the thigh rest apart and toss the foam and cover. I remade the seat using a squishy yoga mat and naugahyde and am now thoroughly enjoying using the Roman Chair. Good luck to the rest of you."
4,"Easy to Assemble, Compact, and Functional","This product is easy to assemble, use, and does not take up alot of space."
1,for women only,i seriously don't know what the heck these people were thinking when they made this product. this product destroys your crotch! i couldn't do a single hyperextension on this thing because it hurt so bad. do not purchase unless you don't care about your groin
5,Great bang for your buck.,"My wife and I have been using the Apex Roman/Hyper Extension Bench for more than two months. It was easy to put together, the main parts not only felt but are sturdy. I didn't got the same feeling with the handles, I'm 6'2 and weight 240lbs and at the beginning I was a little worried and hesitant to fully trust the handles, I was afraid I could bend them but with time I have realized that they can easily hold my weight. After a week of use I had to re-tight some of the screws but since then everything is and feels great."
2,Disappointed!,"I've never given an Amazon delivered product a negative review, as of today, I can never say that again. This afternoon while doing Romans, the seat on the left side cracked, and deviated from the parallel approximately 45 degrees. If not for my agility, we would not be talking about a pissed off customer, we would be talking civil suit filed by an injured and pissed off customer.Keep in mind I've had the equipment less than 4 months, used twice a week for approx. 15 mins each session, and now it's useless! Outside the return window.Just suffice it to say, I'm one unsatisfied customer~ Would I recommend it? Based on the performance of this unit, not!I'm on the lookout again, for an economic, quality Roman chair."
3,Sturdy but uncomfortable,"Like other reviewers pointed out, the pad is uncomfortably hard, especially for male users. Using a pillow helps, but it shouldn't have to come to that. Although the footprint of this hardware isn't huge, but it is not considered small either, and the fact that it isn't foldable means wherever you put it is wherever it will stay; you can't stow it in a closet or under the bed, and you can't easily move it around either. Assembling time took about 30 to 45 min, but most of that is turning the heavy duty nuts and bolts."
3,Came with part that was broken,"Before I even put the thing together I noticed the knob that's used to adjust the height of the leg brace was broken. It can still be adjusted without the knob, it's just more difficult to do so and the machine itself is a little more unsightly. It wasn't worth my time to return the whole thing just to get a new knob, but it still pisses me off. Another thing to note, this thing is way bigger than it looks in the picture. It's nice that it's so sturdy once you put it together, but it takes up a ton of room. Don't think you'll be able to easily fold it up or anything either- Once it's assembled, it's pretty much a bolted together giant piece of metal.All that aside, it does what it says with regard to giving you an excellent lower back workout. I doubt anything this cheap would do the same job."
4,Good for the price,"I bought this for my Crossfit workouts. For any of you that need a sturdy, inexpensive alternative, this is a good way to go. I'm 5'7"" and it fits me just fine. I can see where you might want to extend the handles if you are much taller. If you are doing exercises for speed you'll probably need to rig a foot strap/stand to push against for the GHD situps. I did this by taking a couple of ab slings and hanging them off the foot pads."
1,Craptastic,"First off I got a used chair. When I opened the box everything had already been opened up on the inside. The screws were loose all over the box and all the protective padding was out of place.Then when I got it put together the base was warped so that it doesnt sit flat. It wobbles around while you use it. I put it together correctly (pretty easy to do btw), its a defect from the manufacturer.I feel ripped off."
1,Parts were defective,"Very nice price and quick delivery... However, one of the post had the holes drilled on the wrong side. A clear manufacturing error. I am not certain how many of these products are currently defective. I fixed the issue by drilling my own holes versus returning the product."
1,hyper extension bench,"Have not been able to use it since it arrived missing the most important piece, the adjustment knob. Without that piece, you could fall and hurt yourself because that is needed to balance your feet. Backordered from Chine more than a month ago......"
1,Do not buy!!! Cushions reak of gasoline!,"Possibly dangerous chemicals!!! I have ordered two of these benches. I have returned one of them and I am stuck with the other one, which i had to get out of my house.When they arrived they both looked good and went together easily. I noticed the overwhelming smell of petroleum immediately and repeatedly tried to clean it with soapy water, Fantastic and even let it breathe out on the porch for a few days. The smell did not fade.I called the company and asked for assistance. They advised me that they would send out new cushions immediately at no charge. I thought this was great, but it was just a lie. It has been over a month and several calls and I have received nothing. They were just BSing me."
5,"Easy, straight forward installation and workouts are what you make of it.",This product is very sturdy and a great addition to your home gym.
1,Worthless,"This product is totally worthless as the box was ripped open and resealed either prior to shipping or during transit. Either way, the fastening hardware and a leg cushion were not in the resealed box. Nothing but a busy signal at manufacturers ""hotline"" I can only assume they receive a lot of complaints for their incomplete shipped items. What a waste of time. Stay away and spen your money elsewhere. This seller is not worth the hassle."
2,Apex Roman / Hyper Extension Bench,"Machine is well constructed but should have been made adjustable - also, no instructiuons were included and after having contacted the company to request instructions, I have never heard from them"
4,apex roman bench,"for the price, not a bad piece of home gym equipment. cushion could be softer but overall it works the back & abs real good."
4,"Should be five stars, but packaging needs work","The box arrived damaged. The contents were all there, but the pack containing the the bolts, nuts, and washers was open -- parts were scattered in box -- fortunately none were missing as box top had slid about 8 inches past end and they could have easily fallen out. There was no damage to the bench itself. I noticed other complaints about the packaging which could easily be corrected by adding an additional strap lengthwise perpendicular to the others to keep the box from trying to slide open in shipment due to the weight of the parts enclosed. The bench itself assembled very easily, is obviously well made and sturdy, and rates a five, as does the quick arrival even with free shipping. But the box definitely needs to be secured better."
4,Sturdy,"This roman bench is very sturdy. The only problem I had while putting it together was that the handles don't fit the frame/line up with the pre-drilled holes. The handles wiggle a bit due to this, but overall the bench is nice for home use."
4,I like it,"I like it. I can do sit-up and back extension with no problem. But like others already mentioned it would be great if it has longer handles.Overall, good prodcut."
5,Great Buy,"This is a solid piece of machinery. Probably not as durable as a gym machine, but perfect for home use. I have been using this product regularly for my lower back and the results have been fantastic. The pain in my back has decreased significantly. I see no reason to buy the much higher priced benches advertised online."
1,Very dissapointed,"Came right away..holes misdrilled and structural piers dont line up..couldn't attatch one of the arms because of the mis-drilled holes..advise getting a chair from a reliable company..padding is good, for what it's worth..:("
5,Great customer service,"This roman hyper extension bench is solidly built & is very easy to assemble. It's great for exercise but can also be used to stretch the lower back. During assembly, I discovered one of the main parts was cracked & a bolt was not threaded properly. I immediately called the company (IMPEX Inc in Industry, CA) & they sent me the parts within 48hrs - no questions asked or hassles. Their customer service was outstanding. Would definitely buy from them again."
3,Cheap!,Much cheaper than buying a regular ham and glute machine which retail for $500. Used for crossfit workouts. Only downfall is hard to do crunches since only one foot bar and distance not adjustable but you get what you pay for.
2,Too wobbly,"The ""seat"" section is not very sturdy. It wobbles. We have it as tight as we can, and it just shakes. Too much money for that kind of quality..."
4,Its good.,"This product works. It provides a great exercise for abs and lower back. I am 6'1"" 195 lbs and I don't feel like the product is going to break on me. I thought this product sits pretty high but it doesn't take away from the workout.The parts were loose in the box and I had to hunt them down, but they were all there. The ""durable powder coating"" was chipped on one of the handles, and the seat had a hole punctured on one side of it. It still works so I can't complain to much. It comes with an allen wrench but you will also need a socket wrench."
5,A Great piece of equipment,"I used to us one of these at the gym years ago and loved it.It arrived today, easy to put together and very well made. I am 190 lbs and this machine could hold 300 with ease.If your looking for a lower back and Ab machine, I would recommend this to anyone."
3,Great Lower Back,"Update 07/14/2012I had this for about 8 months and then sold it on craigs list. It was solid in construction all the way through. I personally preferred a 45 degree roman hyperextension like they have at the gym. It offered me less stress on my lower back and I can do more exercises on it. This design is sort of clumsy and uncomfortable. It was pretty cheap, but I'd recommend getting a slanted one for a little bit more.-------------------------------------This Roman Hyperextension was a great deal for what it cost. I use it all the time and I feel you get a way better movement on your lower back than the lateral hyperextensions at the gym. Its easy to assemble, you just need a ratchet or wrench to tighten some bolts. You can do abs and back and more. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get in shape around the waist."
5,This Is An EXCELLENT Buy!,"I have to say this is a excellent buy!!! I looked at the reviews before I ordered it and noticed some people were saying the handles get in their way. I got this in the mail today, put it together and I have to report that you'd have to be a really large person for those handles to get in your way. For one, they only extend maybe 3 inches past the seat cushion and they are set out 3 inches or so. If you are a larger person just don't attach the handles and problem solved! The bench would work just find without them attached and the handles are not really needed any way. Other than that the bench is very stable. I highly recommend it!! Also, you can't beat the price!! I LOVE it!!"
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to.,"This bench was the cheapest one I saw on Amazon, so I was a bit skeptical, but it's actually well made and very stable! I don't have a single complaint about it. It only has the one function, but I gave it five stars because it's a great deal for the price."
3,Not bad for the price,"There are other benches with more features, but you will pay more. Overall it's decent quality and a good value for the price."
3,Not bad for home use,The bench is not bad for the home use. You feel a bit unstable when making excersise as the bench webbles under your weight. It's also not good that you can not adjust either the height of the seat post or the distance between the rear post and the seat post. I also wonder why there is no wrench in a tool kit. Otherwise it's ok for such money.
3,nice item but missing parts,my husband likes it but was very frustrated because he cannot assemble do to the fact that theres missing bolts and washers so now its just sitting there...i expected better customer service
2,Eh - does the job I suppose,"You get what you pay for. I always seem to be relearning that lesson over and over. All of the connecting joints are non-orhtoganol to point of absurdity. I can do the exercise I need to, but 15 degree offsets in the frame necessitate shims underneath it, and I expect to be exceptionally strong along one side of my back. Next time I'll pry the extra sheckles from my wallet."
5,Great stuff!,Completely satisfied and recommend to everybody. Did not expect such quality for less than 70$! Easily put together and transported to office where i can practice whenever i want!
5,Apex Extension Bench,Great piece of equipment to have to help tone the stomach area. Doesn't take up much room at all.
5,good for streching,great deal and fast shipping. we purchased a few exercise machine and turned out garage into a home gym and love it. saved lots of money too> now i can work out on my own time and at my own pace.
5,Good price for what you get,"I am 6'1"" and 225 lbs and this chair fits OK. It would be nice if it was a bit more adjustable, but for the price, you can't beat it."
3,Price is reasonable.,"Price is reasonable, although a bit too tall for a 5'3"" person to use. I am happy with the quality."
3,hyperextension bench,"Solid after putting it together. Heavy duty. Good instructions.I am short. The seat is set too high. When you go to drape over the seat to do hyperextensions, you wind up with your chest instead of your belt line laying across it. You could use a step. I found it annoying and returned it. When doing Roman chair situps, the narrow ankle pads did not go low enough to do the exercise in a way that worked the intended muscles.I received a suprisingly fast refund."
2,Not appropriate for all body types-disappointed.,"Was looking so forward to this fitness pc for my gym but unknownst to me it was not fitting for someone as petite sized as i could not hyper extend over bench as too wide so had to immediately pay more than three times the shipping they sent it to me for to have it returned. I am still hoping to find 1 now for my growing home gym.I am expecting not to to have ANY balance on my card after this extreme expense when I understood it to be for all sizes. It just did not work for me being under 5""3'."
2,Apex extension bench,"I am used to using a 45 degree extension bench at my gym and thought it would be useful to have one at home. The one I have previously used (and love) has a footrest near the floor with a heel plate to keep your legs down. You then easily lean over the padded bench itself and flex forward. It is easy to use and comfortable. Unfortunately, the Apex unit forces you to lean over the padded bench and then hook your legs under the footrest which sits well above the ground. It is very awkward to get into this position and lean forward. Also, I wish the front frame legs were wider to make it a bit more stable. It can be used and is a great price, but I would have rather paid more for a different unit had I been able to find one. Also, it is a bit short for someone over 6 ft."
4,So far so good.,"I am so surprised by the quality of this product that I felt the need to create a review. I never purchase cheap when it comes to exercise equipment, but I just couldn't bring myself to spending a couple hundred just for hyper extensions!So far I am very happy I took a chance. It provides exactly what I require and would recommend it to anybody who is looking for something similar."
4,great,I found out about this book when researching Clara Bow. It really is terrific. I suggest you read it right away!
5,The music is awesome to listen to and never tiring to hear !,From the first song to the end of the cd you are swept along as if you are part of the music. One song you want to dance and the other you feel like you want to be in a romantic mood. The Mandala cd is wonderful just like this Live in America.
5,Acting on the Best in Adult Education,"The summary description of this book is accurate, and I will not repeat it. The value of this book is in guiding those who wish to take action in the increasingly important field of adult education. As institutions of higher education develop plans to meet the increasing demand for adult learning, this book should be consulted, both to act on the best, and to avoid costly mistakes. I have known and worked with Bill Maehl over a number of years, and am strongly of the opinion that this is the best policy guide available for the innovative non-traditional educator. Only a person with his vast knowledge and experience could have produced a work that is this valuable."
3,"Well, I liked it when I was 5.......","They don't make them like this anymore...no wait, they still do...... Well, When I was very little, this was on a Sunday afternoon adventure theater type show along with other ""greats"" like Robinson Caruso on Mars, the Mole People, First Men in the Moon......you see where I'm going with this? Okay then, you'll know what I mean when I say it's a classic. Why did MST3K have to go away? This would have been a prime candidate. Anyway, I searched it down in one of my ""nostalgic"" moods, and laughed so hard through the whole thing. I was amazed at how easily entertained I must have been in my youth.If you lke cheesy, old sci fi classics, definitely add this one to your list."
4,Low budget movie - but still entertaining,"For a movie filmed on a shoestring budget - it actually is halfway decent. The special effects are terrible of course. The sets are cheap (what sets there were) and a very noticable error about midway through the film, when there rafting thrugh a cave supposedly moving, acting like they were moving, and weren't moving at all. For what they had to work with in those days - I can still live with it. I admit I was surprised that with the VHS also came a DVD-R and that the movie wasn't as deteriorated as I expected it to be being a 45+ years film. All the actors and eve bernhardt did a good job"
2,or 1.5 stars hor.? of this planet,"from what i could see good color and scenery and the still and floating alien head and pendulum, thats was it to the film, story-i dont know, im in it for the scenery action of monsters-no monsters-lousy."
2,Communist Nonsense,"While the horticultural information is minimally valuable, the communist anti-capitalist quackery contained herein is worthless and wrong. Much better books are available such as the Vegetable Gardeners Bible by Edward C. Smith expanding on the deep wide bed philosophy of the French Intensive Method and Square Foot Gardening by Mel Bartholomew which replaces commercial techniques with one based on providing food for a single family. Add a Rodale book on organic gardening and you will have all the information you need without the moralistic communist anti-profit preaching of Mr. Solomon."
3,Apple iBook Notebook,"I purchased my notebook used with a one year guarantee, but the product had been advertised as totally reconditioned. I had to return it just a few days later because it stopped working all together. Apple replaced some parts that went bad, but now I can't use the scroll tool. It's a problem I'm sure can be fixed, I just wish that I didn't have to go through all the hassle."
2,Barely adequate,"Sound volume is low and indistinct. Increasing volume does not make it easier to understand, just louder. Does a fairly good job of limiting outside sound.Lanyard style can be inconvenient. Earbuds can be hard to insert when you get a call. Fob on end only display caller's number, not the programmed name.Other side of line frequently has problems with hearing, microphone doesnt work well.Like most bluetooth devices, lacks a user friendly on/off mechanism to decline using headset when it isnt convenient. User must go through the disconnect or power down process to use phone handset instead.Overall, not a purchase I would recommend. Reconsider your desire to have earbuds."
3,"Greaet Sound, very short range","I have used three different bluetooth stereo headphones so far including this one. This Sony one has very good sound quality for music. It pairs up easily, and fits in the ear comfortably. I would give 4 stars for these.However, I was very disappointed at its way short range. The spec said it works up to 30 ft, in reality the connection completely stops at about 10 ft. If you don't mind the short range, this is a great bluetooth headphone. if you need longer range for your application, better look for something else. -1 star for this reason."
4,pretty good for what it does,"very use full item for someone who could use it. very well made, very comfortable and good sound. you hardly notice it around your neck."
2,Sound is fine for my ears but product design unworkable,"I sought out a2dp headphones and have owned this product for a month or two and use it with a Treo 680.(1) Never had a ""necklace"" style bluetooth and, while I'm trying to get used to it, the little plastic pieces that make the ""rope"" into a necklace BROKE.(2) The thing keeps shutting itself off after 5 minutes of use -- enough to make me want to return it. JUST AFTER the 30-day return policy.(3) Even after adjusting the earbuds to fit, they fall out of my ears after 5 minutes.:("
3,Ok Buy,I bought this product when it first came out. The sound quality is not great but its good for being bluetooth. I've used other products and the sound is better than the other I've used. The battery has finally worn out and will no longer hold a charge I've had this product for 3 years and as a cheap Bluetooth headset I recommend.
2,skips and short battery,"I really thought this product would be all I was looking for--music/books in the background and phone control when needed. I've used wired headphones but my regular use while skiing, biking, and running made the long cord quite the inconvienence--especially after I ripped the cord on my best pair.In theory, these are great. But they have major weaknesses: it skips all the time (and I cant figure out why) and it runs out of battery before I finish the shortest workout (less than 2 hrs with music running)!In spite of that I still use it all the time and put up with its flaws. I probably wouldn't have bought it had I known before hand though."
1,Sony Ericsson Bluetooh headset HBH-DS970,The sound of the bluetooth headset just cannot compare with the wired headset that came with my sony handphone W760i. Tinny and distorted.
3,Good for bluetooth - ok for music,I was expecting a little more out of this headset. I mean bluetooth conection and all displays work great with my K-790. I got caller ID with Name and freedom from something in my ear at all times. With my BlackBerry I only get caller ID number - no name - so it kinda sucks.For music - there's definitely not enough Bass. Overall good quality for bluetooth headset for talking and listening - so so on music playback.
2,Returning mine after one day,The music quality is absolutely terrible--it sounds like a cheap toy. Stay away from this headset if you're looking for something to stream MP3s from your phone or other bluetooth device.
3,Bueno pero no Tanto,"Recientemente compre este manos libre, me gusta mucho escuchar musica y el poder evitar tener Telefono + ipod era lo que buscaba, tengo un K790a el cual se escucha bien quizas un poco bajo para mi gusto, el ML se acopla rapido al telefono, como manos libre no me quejo, permite realizar y recibir llamadas, cuando la llamada es recibida en la pantalla te aparece el identificador de la misma,, como reproductor de musica tiene su gran debilidad y es la calidad del audio,, el equipo no posee reproduccion para sonidos bajos, en el telefono tuve que configurar el equalizador sin nada de agudo para que se pudiera escuchar mas o menos bien, de lo demas posee buen volumen y te permite controlar la musica sin tocar el telefono,,gracias"
5,Will get you out of a sticky situation,"You will only need to lock yourself out of your house because your keys are in your locked, running car one time to realize that this is invaluable! Super heavy duty, I am comforted that my key can be available when I need it but cannot be available for all. It's a lifesaver, every home needs one of these!"
4,works well,"Works perfect for storing the extra key - using it to keep one in case my kids forget to take their key. Been using it for over a year now (I think) and never had an issue. Occasionally it's just a bit tough for the kids to open (like have to type in the code twice), but never an issue that prevented them from getting the key or wanting to throw it into the street. I'd buy again if I needed another."
3,Mechanical issues,"This item was priced comparably, and the construction is sturdy metal. Having some trouble with the keys actually activating the tumblers inside. Need to push the keys on numerous tries to successfully activate the unlocking of the mechanism. Keys are unpredictable."
4,"Works as described, but 1 clarification","This lock is pretty decent. Does exactly what I need. It's very heavy (read: durable).Straight forward setup, only took seconds.The only downside, is while there are 10 buttons, the pass code is not sequential. Meaning if you put in 7-2-4-1-8 as the code, I could punch in those same 5 digits, in any order, and the lock would open. Now you still have to know the right numbers, but it's worth clarifying for those thinking it's otherwise.Really a great unit, I keep my spare set of apartment keys in it, in the basement, in case I ever get locked out. Perfect fit for me."
2,Definition of INSANITY,"I placed a spare key in the box while on military deployment, and frequently received emails about the keys not working or getting stuck. I replaced the box with the same model and experienced the same problems."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best thing that they have made the CoF, the video is grandiose, so much that of From the....., as the live 4 topics, the sound is good and the quality of the image is good, buy the video, if they are really lovers of CoF, don't lose this opportunity.......CoF.......Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,CoF IS METAL,I remember about 5 years ago I went over to a friends house.. She asked me if I liked Cradle of Filth.. At the time I had no clue who they were.. They were still underground at the time.. So we watched the VHS of PanDaemonAeon & ever since then I was hooked. Since then I've gotten every cd by them and I'm currently working on collecting the DVDs as well.
4,"Ok, not the best though","I have this video and I love it cause it's Cradle of Filth. I have every album and all and I needed this too. The music video is cool, if a little cheesy (I didn't find it to be as gory and *shocking* as perhaps you would think). The ""making-of"" part of the video is a lot of filler. It's cool to see the members of CoF (most of them not in the band anymore) just hanging out and stuff, but the overall video quality isn't that great and neither is the sound. The live performances bugged me to no end. They focused mainly on Dani (not that I'm complaining) and some chick writhing around on stage. I wanted to see more of Sarah Jezebel Deva (she's an awesome singer and they might have panned to her *twice* during the whole segment, meanwhile, she sang a hell of a lot more than that)....If you're a fan of CoF, it's a must have. If not, skip it. I hope they release their videos on DVD some day. That would be a great buy."
2,The FabricLive Series Disappoints Again,"Although Fabriclive and Fabric albums are obviously suppose to differ in regards to being truely live recorded sets versus pure studio sets(that may or may not have be modelled after a set that the featured artist or DJ actually played at the fantastic London-based club), there sure is an overwhelming difference in quality between the two major series overall. Sure, Fabriclive is live, and therefore will sound a little more raw, but that is not the issue with the majority of Fabriclive's albums. The artists, DJs, and more importantly their sets are terrible! Diplo is no exception. I may have electronica genre preferences which guides (with some bias) my music collection, I do still try to sample a little from each genre and subgenre whenever possible.I had a hard time listening to this ablum in its entirity. Various types of a particular food kept popping into my head. Provolone, Mozarella, Feta...you get the point.2/5 stars for this album."
1,Heroic?,"Normally I wouldn't have picked up this book, but as it was the only available thing at my cousin's house...Anyways, it's obviously an extremely biased book. It's true, there are many facts in here, but only the ones that make George look heroic. Facts on Bush's environmental policies and pre-war intelligence are strangely absent. But to be fair, the pictures were interesting."
3,great pictures,As you can bet this is a pretty biased book. Although everything in here is true I have a feeling there were some things left out as well. This book covers the legislation that Bush passed before 9/11 and the changed administration after 9/11. The best thing about this book is the pictures. They are in color and they are great. They alone are worth the cost of the book.
2,"Flimsee, not worth the money","This CD player is not worth the price, it has okay sound. I had mine for a couple of mounths when the top broke off. That was fine the warrany covered it, but 1 year latter the same thing happened. Anoother thing I would charge my batteries over night and they would only last a couple of hours."
5,Outstanding entertainment from the master,This is an outstanding DVD with excellent performancesQuincy is the MASTER of MUSIC and arrangmentsGreat Band and Singers I highly reccomend this
3,Wanted to Love it...Just misses mark,"The premise and execution are first rate,I really wanted to give this concert five stars but ......After all it's a concert and the sound mix was definately lacking,poor sound staging,some instruments seeming lost entirely ( DTS HD Master included). For all of the extrodinary talent and musicianship assembled for this once in a lifetime event it left me wanting. The video was shot extremely well and I will watch it,probably just with the LPCM stereo mix"
4,"A warm, wonderful book that champions interfaith children.","This book is a wonderful affirmation of those of us who are half-Jewish. As an adult child of intermarriage (Jewish dad and Catholic mom) who grew up in a secular home, I have struggled with spiritual and ethnic identity issues for awhile and have felt very alone in my mixed heritage. While the Christian religions are very welcoming toward us, Judaism is not accepting of intermarriage in general and is somehow threatened by our existence. Unfortunately many interfaith children, myself included, find that Judaism is their intrinsic ""faith of residence."" After all the muddling I have done and have yet to do to work out these issues I am so happy to see a book that validates us with humor and seriousness and pop culture references :) Another wonderful book on the subject is ""Between Two Worlds: Choices for Grown Children of Jewish-Christian Parents"" by Leslie Goodman-Malamuth and Robin Margolis."
3,No complaints but there are better o,"I really shouldn't complain here. This router is powerful and does a great job. The soft start is nice and it comes with a variety of accessories. But I just saw the Dewalt kit that's coming out. It blows the Makita away. The plunge has dust collection built in that is really slick. And it comes with a D-handle. Something I would really like to have. but it looks like Makita only offer their D handle with a motor. Gee I've got one of those already. Plus the Dewalt did better in a recent shoot out in one of the magazines. Cost savings I'm sure. For things like switch placement, and ease of use.Oh and the bits that come with the 1/2"" capable Makita are 1/4"". Hold out for the Dewalt."
5,Plunge Attachment,"Concerning the previous post of not being able to buy the plunge base. It is available separately, the part # is 193457-3"
3,Not a toy....but it is cheap,"Comes with the mouth piece, many others do not...be sure you read your descriptions well.We got this for our Cub Scout so he could learn to play bugle for Boy Scouts...we wanted a nice bugle which was cheap enough so if he decided he didn't like it we wouldn't be throwing away a bunch of money. This met that need in spades....but the welds are really weak...son sat it on the floor and it tipped over, just that little bit broke the weld that held the curl to the horn, once this weld broke it seperated at the neck weld.Well you get what you paid for. It is easy enough to put the two pieces of the horn back together, but we have had to wrap the handle with cording to hold it all together...this however makes it look very authentic.Great for beginners-but it is not a toy, its a real instrument."
5,Extremely Versatile,I've had this pan for about a year and it is a favorite for cooking bacon on one side and eggs on the other... all at the same time... The non-stick is much better than the Farberware Millenium set I have and the surface is much smoother. I recommend highly.
5,Made cooking b'fast for a large group a piece of cake!,Have used this twice since I got it and it makes cooking bacon and eggs for 4 plus people at a time a breeze! Everyone can actually eat at the same time!
5,Great for Smooth cook tops,Just wanted to combat the review that says this wont work on smooth cook tops. It DOES. We have a GE ceramic cook top and we bought this with some trepidation because it is raised. A lot of worry for nothing. It performs beautifully. We were lucky enough to get the bridge burner on our GE and using the all clad griddle with it makes it worth while. I can cook an entire breakfast on this griddle with no problem. French Toast and Bacon on the same pan? NO PROBLEM. Cooks like a dream and is easy to clean. LOVE!
4,great double grill,"This all clad is heavy and sturdy, but not as heavy as cast iron. It is hard to clean in that its size does not fit into my deep sink too well and I end up cleaning portions of it at a time. Having said that, the grill itself cleans easily. I store it in my stove because it won't fit anywhere else."

3,Unschool/Homeschool,"I bought this book, couldn't wait to read it. It was enjoyable. Some was little boring, but for the most part rather interesting. It isn't just unschoolers, it does show what homeschoolers are capable too. So, it did make some interesting reading. I'm more for unschool now than homeschool; I'm hoping someone does a doc or full blown book on what unschoolers are really capbable of doing. I'm an adult who has recently delved right into unschool for myself rather than trying to return to college. I'm finding that life a lot better and cheaper plus harder cause one has to create their own learning completely. But it is fun. This book has given me a lot of ideas. And has given me some much needed encouragement."
3,I enjoyed this book,but felt at times I was reading too much detail into each life. I found myself skimming over some of this as each writer went into quite a bit of detail about their interests and day to day life. I was very interested in their updated essay. This book did help me have courage to continue unschooling my 4 young children.
5,Heartwarming and Hopeful!,"Thank you Luke Yankee for writing this warm and wonderful book! It gives us all courage to look at our own childhood with a clear eye. As well, you humanized an industry with your personal, hope-filled stories. I just re-read it and discovered more!"
1,"""Ulysses"" is better","I haven't read this book, but I have read ""Ulysses,"" the best novel of the century. Forget ""Stolen Moments"" -- the title is a dead giveaway that the book doesn't amount to much. In ""Ulysses,"" on the other hand, nothing happens and everything is revealed."
5,Stolen Moments,"""Stolen Moments"" was an exceptional effort from Barbara Jeanne Fisher. Her story was written with an intense passion that can be felt by the reader."
4,Sweet love story - a step back in time,"If you are in the mood for a sweet love story, try this one. Remember when we didn't have to know EVERYTHING that happened!? Remember when a love story was about love and not sex? :) Barbara Fisher has written a wonderful LOVE story. She shares a lot of information about some of the auto-immune diseases without bogging the reader down. The story itself is drafted with some sadness...but then, it's about real life. Hard to believe this is her first novel. I hope there are many more...our world is often lacking in sweetness."
2,An interesting premise,"Considering the subject matter, this was a decent book. The characterization was somewhat weak, but I found the emotionalism was true to the mark. If you like really heavy, dark books about cancer victims, this is the book for you.All in all, it was a worthy read, if somewhat drab."
5,Entertaining/thought provoking,"A great book to say the least!! This book had two very strong characters, Julie Hunter & John Lipton, both were very thought provoking and entertaining. A very enjoyable read which left me wanting more!!"
1,"You'll ask yourself, why did I keep keeping this book.",I put too much faith in the reviews that had been written about this book. I wish there had been a rating for the intelligence quotient of this novel. The misspelled words and the bad punctuation were enough signals for me to put the book down and admit I'd made a bad selection. The sappy story was too predictable. The medical situation was factual and handled well. Thank goodness for that.
1,Stolen Moments,I love all books but I must admit this was the worst book I have read in a long time. Talk about predictable! It was sort of like being at the scene of an accident...knowing I should look away but also experiencing the need to know what in the world is going on. Boring...boring...boring.
1,JUST SAY NO!,"STOLEN MOMENTS IS BORING, UNBELIEVABLE, AND POORLY WRITTEN. IF YOU WANT TO READ A BOOK THAT GOES STRAIGHT TO THE HEART, READ THE PHONE BOOK. IT'S MORE INTERESTING THAN THIS SAPPY WASTE OF PAPER."
4,It was fascinating!,"I don't agree with the reviewer for Library Journal because I found McClintock's book thorough and solid. She situates the book in a very clever way in the myriad of ""isms"" and scholarly debates on post-colonialism. She argues that one cannot talk about colonialism without at the same time investigate how gender,race, sexuality, class etc, has shaped the colonial discourse and discussion.I would recommend this book to people interested in feminist, gender, postcolonial studies but also to anyone who wants a more indepth and creative analysis of the current debate on postcolonialism and gender."
2,Unconvincing,"The 3 leading ladies had no chemistry what so ever, even when the 3 dare share a bubble bath. The oldest daughter Tilden was the most hateful and unlikable girl I have ever seen. Not one convincing smile crossed her bland face. The lack of chemisty however had nothing to do with actress Elizabeth Perkins who is always a joy on screen. Also Scott Bakula was good too. It all boils down to heavy handed melodrama at it's dullest."
2,Doesn't last long,"This bar isn't one that will last very long. After about 3 months of light use, the tolerances on the center clamp wore to the point where there was much play in the bar. Spend a little extra money for one that will last you longer."
2,Curl,"One of the threaded collars was machined incorrectly, it wobbles and is loose. Cannot tighten down. Typical inferior, sub standardMADE IN CHINA crap."
4,"Great Bar, with no collars","The bar is great, but it was twice mailed without the included collars. Amazon failed to help, so I contacted Impex Fitness(their number is on the box if you can read it) They immediately sent me some collars, something I guess Amazon couldn't handle. Love the bar, but it must travel the world first, because both boxes arrived completely destroyed."
4,Get it,And 1 and ESPN made ulimate DVD for streetball. All got to say is go get this DVD. One more thing...RIP Flash(1975-2004)..you will be miss.I can't wait for second season to come out on DVD.
2,Not my favorite Sunfire book.,"This was not one of my favorite Sunfire books. The main character, Veronica, was too self-centered, especially at the begining. During the attack on pearl harbor, all she worried about were her two boyfriends. When she heard of a great tragedy, the sinking of the ship one of her boyfriends is on and the deaths of most of the sailors, all she cares is about her boyfriend, not the other innocent people who died. A dissapoinment."
3,Sunfire... Never A Disappointment,"Veronica is a young 15 year old girl placed during the time of the bombing at Pearl Harbor. I love Sunfire books, and I thought it would be especially good, because I enjoyed the new movie that came out a few weeks ago. Yes, Veronica is a spoiled girl who usually gets what she wants, but she's also young, so she has a lot to learn. She had a lot of spirit throughout the whole book, and it gave it a more exciting perspective.One of the reasons I gave this book three stars, and not five, was because from page four, I knew who Veronica would end up with. Knowing the history of the Pearl Harbor bombing gave away the ending, but it was still fun to read."
1,Veronica- A dissapointment,"Veronica is the only Sunfire book I did not like. It was all about a selfish, spoiled girl and I hated it. She did not even think about anyone but herself. It was very dull and not very romantic at all."
4,"So Far So Good, Handle a little narrow","I never really noticed the inner groove as a ""problem"" until I read the other reviews. This was part of my first All-Clad set--so nice! Yes, things stick in the groove, but I just use a silicone spatula while cooking and I don't seem to have a problem. I love the capacity and size/shape of this unit. Scrambled eggs come out beautifully in this pot, as does chocolate ganache and buttercream frosting. But sometimes my pumpkin pie filling gets bits of cooked egg if I'm not diligent about stirring out the groove. The width/depth ratio allows me to really get my whisk or spatula inside to work.Sometimes the dishwasher (horrors, I know!) doesn't get the groove completely clean. I hand-wash it most times anyway, so that doesn't really matter too much to me.I like the length of the handle, but I wish it were slightly thicker to make it easier to grab when using a pot-holder."
3,Just OK,"Someone else pointed out that the quality of this double-boiler is not the same as the pans, and I agree with their assessment. The quality of this product is not consistent with the quality of other All-Clad products."
3,Purchased because of the reputation,"I have to admit -- I bought this insert simply because I love all things All-Clad. While it heats well, the indentation on the inside is a problem. I love it becuase it allows the insert to fit snugly, but I hated working with it until I got one of those small silicone spatulas. It fits perfectly in the indentation and it's the same one I use with my food processor. I made cheese dip over for the Super Bowl and I was impressed with the insert's performance.I see that All Clad now has a ceramic double boiler insert. I must live in a test market because I've only seen it at one store and it's not even on the store's or All Clad's website. I forget the cost but, you're buying the insert and the 2 qt saucepan as a set. The insert is removable. I like this original insert better, even with the indentation, because it's bigger."
4,Misconceptions about teflon,My daughter has this set and she is very happy with it. I also own the EmerilWare large skillet that matches it. One misconception that a lot of people have about teflon is that it peels off because you scratch it. Teflon coatings are harmed by high heat cooking more than anything. If you like to turn your burner on high to get the pan hot then teflon will not perform well for you. The high heat degrades the teflon coating and causes it to peel and chip. The only thing I don't like about this cookware is that the handle does not have a non slip grip on it. The skillet is somewhat heavy so if you want to pour off grease it is hard to hold onto the handle while pouring it out of the skillet. Other than that this cookware performs very well.
4,Humans are just big dogs (and they need more food),"I heard a review of this album on NPR, and what I heard made me laugh so hard, I had to buy it. These songs are great for kids and adults alike and a must have for any dog lover. Great stuff!"
3,Kendell Xeroform-It's Good as a Stop-Gap,"I use these products for my husbands chronic leg ulcers.I used this product in between running out of MediHoney and getting Hydrofera Blue again. This didn't promote healing, but it did help to stop further break-down in the 5 weeks that I used it which is more than I can say for the Medihoney.I'll probably order it again for new shallow ulcers or scratches on his legs, it does help with those."
1,Quick expiration date!,"Bought this for my emergency preparedness kit and the expiration date is 8 months?! That's disappointing....i'm sure it could still be used, but I wouldn't recommend buying unless you know when it expires."
4,Gread addition or starter,"My wife and I received this as a gift to add to our 10"" and 12"" copper core pans. At first we did not think we would find much of a use for it. However, as we often have both of us and our two teenage boys all in the kitchen at the same time during a meal prep, we have found several uses for it. We sear or sweat some ingredients prior to adding them to a larger recipe.If you already have parts of an All-Clad collection this will complement nicely. If you do not have any All-Clad this may be a good place to start."
2,Didn't work for me,I bought Vocabulearn some time ago and used to put it on repeat. I have to admit it had little or no impact on my Spanish vocabulary skills; it's simply too easy to tune out. Eventually I gave up and started using other techniques which were much more effective - flash cards and spaced repetition programs such as Anki.James
1,Don't be fooled,"When I first listened to these tapes I thought my copy might be defective - the second voice is barely audible. This could be a great program, but you can't hear it without making one voice so lowd that it hurts! Nice idea, horrible production."
1,Could have been good!,"Lots of reviews sound good. I bet they are from the vender of this product.I could not imagine anyone being happy with these tapes.One male voice says a word in English loudly Followed by a female in Spanish whispering, or maybe she has laryngitis.The faintness of the second voice is such that it makes the tapes WORTHLESS. I could even finish listening. Tempted you may be to buy but these tapes are a real disappointment. I had to put 1 star minimum to post here but really it gets none!"
3,Soviet T-62 Photo Book,"This book by Michael Bishop is a photo book. At 29 pages, it is short. There are only 3 color photos, the rest are B&W.; One page of history on the T-62. One page of line drawings to show front, rear, side, top aspects of the tank. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, more has become available on Soviet tanks.This is a book for modelers who want to see close up photos of every aspect and angle of the tank. Bishop does that, and there are photos of the inside as well. The captions are good; the photos are sometimes grainy or dark.This is a very good companion book to have on the T-62, but I don't think it stands out by itself."
1,Give this one a pass!,"I don't know what's more annoying about this book, the chirpy tone or the moronic advice. Not only are the tips all over the map, but they are just that--tips--with no help at all given to developing an overall philosophy or strategy. Loeb also completely ignores the emotional aspect of financial planning, leading to ridiculous advice like taking out a home equity loan to pay off credit card bills. Sure you can reduce your rate by doing that. But you're likely to run your cards up again. And now you've put your house at risk. Real smart move, Marshall.I'm so grateful that I checked this book out of the library rather than spending good money on it. My advice: Almost any other basic personal finance book would serve you better than this one. A couple of good ones that deal with the emotional and the practical aspects of financial planning are Suze Orman's, Ruth Hayden's, and Jerrold Mundis'. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Ghosts of England & Belgrave Hall,Would not recommend this DVD. Very boring with to much talk and very little anything else. We turned it on and after 20 minutes gave up and never watched it again. Ghost Hunters (TAPS) DVD is much better.
3,Skyraider over Korea.,I have been a big fan of the Skyraider for some time. It is a fast and powerful prop fighter/bomber. This is the first book I have bought on the plane. I was both impressed and disappointed with it. It does cover alot of different aspects of the plane and it's uses. But it covers very little of its action over vietnam. The book is largely concern with the Skyraiders development and then its actions over Korea. But not much about Nam. The pictures are very good. The drawings and centerfold are excellent. And all these books are value for money.
1,Do not buy this video,"For one thing, It is definitely not for kids. It is hardly a sequel of Ninja Scroll. Do not waste your money on this. Animation is little better than some saturday American-made cartoons."
5,The whole story,I have a 13 year old TV. I just got a PS2.When i got home I found out that my TV did not have the right input. I my parents took me to the store they bought me my PS2 in to return it. I went looking at the video games and i found the VGE (Video Game Enhacer). I found out what it was. I bought it. when I got home i used it it gave me a beter picture then my friend's TV. The price was great to. it progegt's great picture.
1,"I agree, waste of money",All 3 of my TV's have brightness settings. My computer monitor has a brightness setting. What is the use of this thing. They didn't even mention anything about S-VIDEO or COMPONENT(HDTV) connections. I would also give this a '0' star if one existed and I'm not a pessimistic person! :)
4,A must for gamers without s-video!,"At first I didn't think this device would do anything, but now that I've used it I know it works very well.It's an absolute must for anyone that doesn't have s-video connections (if you do, you'll have to wait until an s-video version is available).It makes the games look better, and I find myself always using it -- not just for dark games. Colors are more vivid and details of the game are more visible.Don't take my word for it though, there are a couple professional reviews on the 'net and they'll give you all the details."
3,There is a difference ...,"Between BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST.Please don't listen to the reviews below.This little box provides fairly high quality contrast control, especially for televisions that cannot do it by itself.When you crank the brightness up on a monitor(aka tv), you will notice that EVERYTHING is ""brighter"" ... even the blacks ... which is NOT supposed to be happening.Contrast seperates and enhances the whites and blacks(without making the blacks look GREY) and helps to provide a brighter and more vivid picture.Anyone who is interested in DVDs should know about contrast ;)Have fun.Don't believe the hype ..."
2,Not worth it,"This unit is easy to hook up but is only marginally effective. I don't believe that it achieves very much more than adjusting the TV contrast does. On top of this, the audio/video cable, that is supposed to accompany the unit, didn't. I'm still waiting for their customer servise to respond to this complaint. In general, I wouldn't waist my money."
1,I bought this piece of poop,"I got this thing thinking it would better my game play. Well, as it turns out, monsters still hide in the dark and power ups are still hard to see. You know why? BECAUSE THATS THE WAY THE GAME WAS MENT TO BE PLAYED! I wasted 40 bucks on something that I could have done with my remote controll. Please, if you want to purchase this item, go right ahead. I am just saying its not worth your money unless you do have a 15 or 16 year old tv."
1,Brightness....,"I've been raising the brightness on my tv for years with games that at certain times can be a little dark (helped a lot with the ""Tomb Raider"" series). And raising the brightness does not affect color qualities if you do it just enough to help see. Do yourself a favor and don't spend money on this product. Use the remote control that came free with your tv, and put that money towards buying another game......... *** UPDATE *** Since originally writing this review I had the chance to see this product in action and boy was I right. As far as games go, adjusting the brightness does the job and it's free. And when it comes to watching a movie, I prefer watching it in it's original state. Imagine watching ""The Exorcist"" and using this product to brighten some of the darker scense. Doesn't sound like an improvement to me."
3,No full expanation.,"It does work well. It is especially works good for dark games like ""Devil May Cry"". However, in the item discription they fail to tell you that it can only be hooked up with audio/video connetors, not regular cable wires. I had to buy an additional cable adaptor for $20.00 to get to work on my TV."
3,does the vge enhancer work,"this enhancer does not do anything your tv cant. All that it does is let you adjust the contrast and brightness from a little machine. It makes the picture brighter, sometimes making it harder to view. when it says to use it when the picture is dark all it does is make the screen completey hazy. Your tv is the same thing as the vge enhancer. it does nothing. Do not buy it. it is the thing that microsoft and nintendo and sony worked to stop. it ruins the whole picture. I have opened up the vge enhancer and found nothing that would enhance a game. Ive found the components to make a tv brighter."
1,would not really help one's gameplay,"Sorry to be a purist - I'm not even a hardcore gamer ... more of a long-time gamer (started with pong on a B&W TV in 1979).But this kind of thing does not improve one's gameplay. Rather, it makes it easier to succeed with lower skill, diligence and practice. Besides that, it reveals mystery in a way that the developers did not intend. You're supposed to stumble into that secret passage way in the dark corner, not spot it from across the room.If you want a passive experience, watch a movie.If you must do this kind of thing - and neglect yourself of the developers' vision - just crank up the brightness on your TV, most also have a sharpness control too."
2,NonStick Worn Off,"I bought this product because it fit my burners really well and came recommended online for my range. It's my first All-Clad product (everything else is Calphalon) and I was curious to see how well it held up. After about a year, the nonstick wore off and it is awful to try to clean---actually, impossible. I'm throwing it out and going with Calphalon next---their customer service is great and they exchange defective products very easily."
5,All-Chad ltd grande grill pan......THE BEST!!!!!,"All-Clad LTD Nonstick Grande Grille PanI have purchased so many grill pans and have been disappointed with them ...because they end up being hard to clean that you just don't want to use it anymore . A friend told me about this one so I bought it and after the first try ..it was a winner!!!! No more soaking,scrubbing ..just soap water and wipe..it's a joy to grill again."
1,RUST!,"I really loved these when i bought them, even though they can't go from stove-top to oven like other brands. I have two and using both at once allowed me to be very efficient in the kitchen. A few months later though, they are rusted over, disgusting and impossible to clean, with no nonstick surface to speak of. All-clad's warranty is completely worthless. They insist that you send them the pans for inspection AT YOUR EXPENSE. If they decide the problem is a result of a covered defect they will replace them and ship you new ones AT YOUR EXPENSE AS WELL. These are heavy pans! If they decide not to replace the pans they will send you back yours, you guessed it, at YOUR EXPENSE as well. By the time you are done sending the pans back and forth you might as well buy new ones, from another company."
5,Same Grille Pan as Giada uses!,"My wife fell in love with this item from watching Giada's shows. She uses it for cooking almost everything and my wife wanted one. I was surprised at the great value on this pan from Amazon and so expected some quality issues, but it is terrific. High quality, sturdy, handles are firmly attached, flawless non stick coating. It cooks great for everything. The only problem is that the ridged bottom is hard to clean, but I don't know how that could be avoided. It is a grill pan, after all. Great item, great price, great gift."
2,All clad grill pan,Product arrived in damaged box and product was damaged as well. It was still usable so we kept it however it has a large gash in the side of it--right in the same spot the box was damaged. Was very disappointed. Busy mom of a newborn so no time to fuss with returning it and waiting for a new one to arrive. Will be wary next time I order from Amazon :(
1,should have been dumped into the Black Sea,"I loved early XTC (saw them only once on the Drums And Wires tour...and that ages me, doesn't it?) but Black Sea does nothing for me at all. They get too clever by half. For me I'll stick with the ""This Is Pop"" era."
3,Very mixed,"Buy this one for the fantastic ""Towers of London"" and the wryly amusing ""Respectable Street"". Much of the rest of this work is just noise, though"
5,Black Sea Ballistics,"Get out your peace grenades, XTC's coming to get you. With the relentless Terry Chambers commanding this operation, Black Sea slams ashore. Black Sea is one of the greatest rock albums of all time. It'll make you want to march over to your stereo and crank it to eleven!Personnel: Andy Partridge - strategic lyrics and guitar; 'Commando' Colin Moulding - mission-specific bass; and Dave Gregory - tactical guitar.Your orders: Step away from your borscht and intercept this CD now.[DW]"
4,"Great, Catchy Music from XTC","I just started listening to XTC. I've heard Black Sea and Skylarking. I really liked Black Sea. I thought that it had fast, catchy tunes for a listener to actually enjoy. This album has three extra tracks that are worth ""Smokeless Zone,"" and ""Don't lose your temper."" A lot of the songs have very interesting lyrics, ranging from war to love. My favorite songs are ""Generals and Majors,"" and ""Burning with Optimisms Flames."""
3,It Started With This Album...,"...and my admiration for XTC began and has lasted since. One of the first ""new wave"" music videos I saw was ""Generals and Majors"", and it made me get the album. Soon, I was then hooked on ""Towers of London"" and images of middle-age England, the genteel folk of privilege, the oppresion of Irish laborers, and the misery of those who were imprisoned in the towers. I soon shook off that dreary imagery and began raising a ruckus with ""Respectable Street"" and Andy's nose-thumbing of suburban phonies. What fun, what joy. However, not every song was as magnetic as those three. It took a while before some of the songs began to catch (No Language In Our Lungs, Travels In Nihilon, Love At First Sight). But the others just didn't do anything for me. Still, I realize now that this was just the beginning of a bay-utiful friendship."
5,May be their best album.,"This one has held up beautifully over time. What fun! Along with Drums & Wires, probably my favorite XTC."
1,poor fit,"this product is misrepresented, I have an 8 inch All-Clad pot. The steamer does not fit down into the pot and all the steam escapes. TOTALLY FRUSTRATING."
1,Don't Buy This,"I bought this steamer insert with the 3 qt. saucepan it supposedly goes with, for my wife. Imagine my disdain when she opened them and they didn't fit together properly... NOT EVEN CLOSE. Don't waste your hard earned money on this product. I am returning it and will never buy ALL CLAD again. Why buy super expensive items when they don't work. Now I have to go through all the hassle of a return, as well. WOW.... ALL CLAD thanks for saving me a ton of dough. I was slowly going to be replacing all my wife's older cookware with your products."
4,excellent steamer,I would recommend this steamer to anyone looking for an easy to use & clean steamer that fits perfectly in to an all-clad 5 oz sauce pan
5,More than just steamed vegetables,"An essential and useful item for the health conscious cook. Fits several size pots made by All Clad having the same diameter but different height. Large capacity nice. I have had my MasterChef cookware for over 30 years and love every piece - this was a nice addition to the set. It can be used for many types of cooking whereas those little pot inserts can't - steamed buns, etc."
1,Lousy Product - Do Not Buy,"We have a lot of All-Clad Cookware and until recently I was happy with it. We purchased this to go on top of 4-quart saucepan and it is a VERY BAD fit... I actually sent it back to All-Clad with explanation and they sent me back another one that was equally bad fit. I just called them and the rep on the phone put me on hold for a while and when she came back from hold she told me that she had just tried out one that they had there & that it was ""Supposed to Wobble like that.""I consider this VERY poor craftsmanship and will never buy anything from All-Clad again."
3,not highest quality of stainless steel,I think the stainless steel is not the same high quality as is the other All Clad pots are made of. Still it serves its purpose and fits my other All Clad pots. It's okay.
2,Why is all the steam coming out of the side?,"I have to agree with the other negative reviews. This insert loosely fits the All-Clad 3-Quart Casserole Pan I bought with it (which I could understand if I were trying to use it with another brand). It being from the same line and company one would think that someone would have tested how well it worked. As with all All-Clad products it's built very well but who cares about that if it doesn't work properly. Someone else mentioned all the perforations are in the bottom of the insert, it would be better if there were holes in the sides as well. I think my artichokes would cook a little faster if tons of steam wasn't rolling out from in between the insert and pan. It works, just not very well."
4,"Beautiful, Fun Book",My toddler and I love this book! The illustrations are colorful and lively. I love that everyone pitches in to help little Eric find his monkey - it conveys a warmth and sense of security we both appreciate. And the ending has an adorable twist.
2,No,"Wood was split and some of the zils fell off. I tried to fix it in a way where the sound wouldn't be affected, but it was no use. I'll be sending it back soon.But it does sound nice if you put it on the floor and hit it with a stick."
5,An important key to specialty Hawaiian healing methods,"From uncovering the inner powers of Hawaiian healing methods to putting these powers to practical use, The Adventurer's Quest provides an important key to specialty Hawaiian healing methods which blend spiritual insights with a focus on underlying powers of the mind. An involving presentation which offers many practical applications for the reader/user."
4,Interesting new twist!!,"We all know the songs already and this does make them sound more up dated in some ways. Whether or not you like the new versions of the older songs, is really a personal taste thing. As for me it just sounds much better and that makes it worth it for me."
2,First version was better,I should have taken the advice of online reviews regarding this CD. Since my son wanted it for Christmas I decided to go ahead with the purchase. He was elated to receive it but after playing it he said it was awful and would rather listen to the original versions.
3,"Stay wealthy, keep your money","This band is the one that led me on the road to love rock, then hard rock, and the on to metal. So excited to see this release and so devastated to hear the actual cd. I think what happened here was Twisted, being in their fifties, forgot how to play their instruments. Dee Snider says ""This how we really wanted to record the album"". What all crappy with too much bottom. Oh yeah, lets also slow the tempo down to about half of what it was. Do not buy this. It's not even worth the listen. Just buy the original and pretend this drink coaster never happened."
1,"Why???? (Slow, Unenthusiastic and, Boring)","I am very disappointed by this disc. First off, when a band re-records their old stuff, it outta send up a red flag. I was foolish enough to get this CD. The band redid the songs 'cause they hated the old ""thin"" sound of the originals. I think the originals sound fast, crisp and excited/on fire. The new versions are bogged down, slow, low and unemotional. I think anyone who gives this a great review (and some have) is trying not to feel bad about the $$$ they wasted (along with me.)The new songs are crap.The one and only worthy track on here is ""Heroes are Hard to Find,"" which you can get on the ""Strangeland"" soundtrack.My advice is to pick up the re-mastered issue of the original version of this cd. It's much better and more heartfelt.This was a good idea but it's just Blaaah. Sorry TS."
3,not what I expected,"I was expecting a better recording of some of the classic songs. I should have done more research and understood what I was getting. The album isn't bad, but I couldn't rate it very high."
3,Original is better,"The original Stay Hungry is better, except for the rerecorded version of ""S.M.F."" This cd has a bad mix, but it's still a good package. The extra recordings are also rerecorded songs from early Twisted Sister before they had a record deal. ""Never Say Never"" and ""Heroes are Hard to Find"" are also available here. I think it's worth buying, but the rerecorded Stay Hungry isn't good."
1,mediocre content - not enough!,"the creator of this product is a company called JUst Enough. But the product isn't enough to begin playing guitar. It won't get you even close to playing guitar. They advertise that it comes with a DVD, a CDROM, a book and an audio cd. The truth is that on the dvd, you are supposed to play things that you should learn on the cdrom. However, the CDROM does not contain the lesson required for you to play. And the book and the audio teaches you exactly the same lesson you got with the CDROM, instead of teaching new things! They say you have 50 lessons. That is a lie. Actual playing lessons are just a few, and very poor ones. It doenst even teach you to learn to tune your guitar, they just tell you to buy a digitar tuner for $20 bucks - and they count this one as ""a lesson"". They also count things like ""choosing your gear"" as a lesson. In other words, it sucks and you'll feel cheated if you buy this thing."
4,wife loves it,i was expecting it to be bigger but it looks cool but all that matters is that my wife loves it
3,bad description,"arrived in a timely manner, but the description of the book was NOT what was sent. only recieved 2/3 of the book that was expected."
3,Lagasse Let Me Down,"I purchased this cookware set as a Christmas gift to myself in 2002. I was initially very pleased and enjoyed the durability and ease with which items could be cooked. But now after a year and a half I'm very disappointed in the skillets. They are hard to clean and even with a good cleaning food is sticking to the nonstick surface. I would expect this from a lower quality product from a warehouse store but these carrry Emeril's name. Also, I watch, ""Emeril Live"" frequently and he doesn't appear to be using this cookware set as much as his stainless."
4,Oooh La La!,"I purchased my beautiful Emerilware about a month ago and have been delighted with the way it both looks and cooks. Foods are cooked evenly and with no burning. However, if you aren't careful, the stainless handles scratch - even when washed with a plastic sponge. Also, I have trouble not being paranoid about cooking reactive substances such as tomato sauce. The literature contains assurances that chips and cracks are not to be expected, but there's no guarantee that the pans won't leach into acidic foods. Emerilware comes with careful instructions regarding care and feeding and does require handling carefully."
5,No regrets!,"BAM! I've had this set for a few years, and it is increduibly durable! They heat up quickly and evenly and retain the heat, even after being removed from the burner. Yes, these pans are heavy, but I consider this a bonus - where else can you get and excellent upper body workout and prepare dinner at the same time?! I researched Consumer Reports prior to buying, and I shopped around for price (these almost NEVER go on sale in the department stores), and Amazon was the best source. Once you try these pans, you'll be hooked, and like me, ordering individual pieces to supplement the set. Happy Cooking!!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"This is probably one of the most unusual documentaries where you rarely even hear elvis speak. A reviewer at Amazon.com stated there are more trains than anything. Well, not far from the truth. However, for a beginning fan, who's just entering the Elvis world, this would be a great introduction. There are some rare film clips in this, although not in the best picture quality. It would give a beginning some insight to one of the most influential singers of the 20th Century. Not to mention my personal favorite :)"
3,bravo binder!,"The best part of this dvd is the interview with Steve Binder. He gave insight into Elvis' strengths and weaknesses in his career path. No, the dvd doesn't have music, but that you can get elsewhere."
5,A new dvd remembering Elvis Presley,"I am a big Elvis Presley fan. And here is an Elvis Presley movie to get on video/dvd. And this takes a 48 minute tour of his life. But left out his death on August 18, 1977. This has mention of Elvis Presley's shot marriage to Priscialla Presley (1967-1973). And we know by know that Elvis grew up as an only child. But his late mother gave birth to Jessie Garon Presley but ended up stillborn. Check this out!"
4,pretty blonde,"At least he thinks she is a pretty little blonde. what an educated little fella wrote that one-star review. makes ya proud to not be in that club. Great record, sensual and slow, unweildy and weird."
2,"Disappointing, Try ""It's Like This"" Instead","Unbridled monotony from an artist who usually displays amazing range. Eight of the eleven or so selections seem to begin with the same chords and the tempo is sooooo slow throughout. There are some inspired moments. The selections/song choices show creativity and imagination. ""I won't Grow up"" is lots of fun. But the same approach, redoing old but forgotten familiars, is leaps and bounds better in ""Its Like This."" That one is tremendous, especially her uplifting rendition of ""Street where You Live."""
2,"80% saccharine, 12% okay, 8% genius","For those who like their saccharine straight up, this album poses few challenges. Rickie sings her slouchy style competently enough, serving up a a candy colored bouquet of easy listening tracks. Only three of these blossoms have any thorns -- 9, 11 and 12. Of these, 12 is a real gem of feeling and honesty leaving the cutsey crap well behind. Would an album filled with songs only like track 12 sell? Probably not, but it would be glorious."
1,Doesn't fit Emerilware Stainless Pans,Tried this in all my Emerilware Stainless Pans and it won't fit any of them. I had to send it back.
1,Optical adapter doesn't work,"I bought the cable just for the adapter, thinking it should be better than the Microsoft product. Unfortunately, the adapter doesn't work and I already own a good HDMI cable, so I will return the product tomorrow. Can't judge the cable, but it looks of great quality as all Monster Cable products. Sorry William, the ""1 star guy"" is not slow, he is just not satisfyied with what he paid for."
2,could live without it,"It really didnt make any kind of a difference using this ""gaming"" hdmi cable vs a normal hdmi cable. The shipping and packaging was great and fast but the product is not worth the time. The optical adapter is faulty also"
5,good,i like the cable work great and came with the plug for connect the audio via optical i recomend
1,DON'T BUY.....,I got this thinking it would be better than the standard cable. Let me tell you it's not. The audio and picture quality suck. There is so much static over the one that came with the system. The picture quality is much better with the standard one. My opinion avoid this product.
1,STAY AWAY!!,"The optical audio adapter does not work!! I bought this thing just for the optical adapter, I already have an HDMI cable. I would give it zero stars but I can't.Monster, hire better quality assurance people!! Goes right back to where I got it from!!"
1,Don't even waste your time on this one,"I bought this item with the monster cable optic because my home theather doesn't supports hdmi, but the included monster surround adapter doesn't work. When the hdmi cable is connected, no audio is sent to the optical monster cable. It looks like monster cable did not even tested these products. Don't waste your money on these monster cables, like the components monster cables for the old xbox, they will destroy your tv inputs..."
4,"More electronic, less ethereal","A more industrial-sounding example of Hecker's work, it freaked out one of my clients and had her asking if the cd player was malfunctioning. I still will sit around doing something random and have this playing. Nice addition to an ambient library."
5,A Must Read For Edith Stein Scholars,"This is really the must read book for anyone seriously wishing to study Edith Stein. It is not an easy book to read yet it is the key to understanding not only her philosophy of intersubjectivity (empathy) but also her later feminist thought. The philosophy presented in this book had a huge effect on the fields of phenomenology and existentialism and it is having an effect on an important theological movement today. I detail all of these connections in my master's thesisThe Transposition Of Edith Stein: Her Contributions to Philosophy, Feminism and The Theology of the Body"
3,It's Good for A Good Laugh!,"This movie is about the daughter of a CEO who was born under an unlucky star. Everything that can possibly or impossibly happen happens to her. This time she manages to disappear to the distress of her father who tries to get her back. Gerard Depardieu plays the man hired to find her. But the only way to find such an unlucky girl is get someone just as unlucky to retrace her steps. That's where Pierre Richard comes in! Pierre Richard plays an employee of the CEO's who is not only an impossibly unfortunate person but he is also very oblivious about it. With Pierre Richard hired to lead Gerard Depardieu in the right direction, it is Gerard Depardieu that feels himself unlucky. That is unlucky to be paired with such a partner. Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard are the French version of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. All in all, a funny movie with some very memorable moments."
3,Just to have fun,"It is a good movie, not a great one, but it still follows an original line. A CEO sends an employee -Pierre Richard -, to find his kidnapped daughter in Mexico. He has been advised to choose him because the employee has such a bad luck, as his daughter has, that he is forcefully going to fall in the same traps and, sooner or later, in the same place than her beloved child. Gerard Depardieu does not believe in such argument and has to make a team with the bad-luck guy. Together, they will made a great team. Hillarious, entertaining and fun !."
5,Who could ask for anything more,"I love cabaret singers, and Ms. Tranelli is one of the best. I had the pleasure of hearing her sing years ago in Chicago and have long treasured the experience. So I was very pleased to discover that she had finally recorded an album that would allow me to renew my acquaintance with her voice, but I wasn't prepared for the fact that she's so much better than I remembered. Everything about this album is first class. She has a great voice and uses it superbly; the arrangements are excellent; the orchestrations are top notch; the variety and range of the numbers are fantastic. In the words of Ira Gershwin, ""...who could ask for anything more?"""
2,Medical Genetics,"The book covers topics in a minimalist fashion and at an undergraduate level rather than the level expected for practitioners who will be expected to use and understand medical genetics and its impact on molecular medicine during their careers. No references are given for those who wish to explore in more detail. For people who wish to explore the ""why"" and ""how"" of medical genetics, other books are better. For the student who wishes to ensure a basic level of competency for USMLE Step 1, it's OK and reasonably priced."
3,Guilty Hearts,"You take a glance at the cover and read the back description and you think ""Wow! An all-star cast in this one movie?! Why haven't I heard of this?"" well, I thought the same. I heard Anna Faris was in this movie and of course, I had to buy it, I own all of Anna Faris's movies that have been released on DVD. I rebought most of Anna Faris's movies on Blu-Ray. Okay, now on to the ""movie"", I have never disliked an Anna Faris movie in any way, but for some reason, I didn't like it that much. I found myself skipping to the Anna Faris short film, and I didn't think it was that great either. It's a good thing I got it for a reasonable price, don't buy it from Amazon, it's overpriced."
1,unexpected,This DVD was not what I expected. It was for the most part quite depressing. I was lookin for something more romantic considering the stars that were involved in each short story. My bad !
4,Excellent pan except for edge,"This pan is fantastic, and has served me very well when making small quantities of sauces (1 qt. isn't a very large pan!). My only complaint about it is that the top edge is suceptible to nicks and scratches. The interior and really the pan as a whole seems nearly invincible, standing up to whatever abuse I dish out. The nicked edge obviously has no effect on its cooking ability, but does somewhat impair the aesthetics of the pan. This rating should really be a 4.5."
5,Value for money,"The CD has most of my favourites in it such as Entrance of the Stars, Raks Bedaya and Habibi Ali. Worth buying to keep."
1,"one legend that needs to be put to rest, for good!!",where to begin! first the creature on the cover is not even in the film!! surprised?? seems like thats the only way horror movies can sell themselves anymore is by putting some cool lookin creature with huge teeth on the cover and the movies not even about a creature that looks anything like it. god what a worthless film!! one of the worst i've seen in a while and i've seen a lot of low budget film. its pretty much a low budget vampire film to be honest. don't even think about checkin this doozy out.
1,Only one word will suffice.... wow.....,"I'm not really sure how to review something that was so unwatchable, I had to force myself to view it all. The production quality (if there is any) is lower than that of your standard adult video, with sound and music that make porn look like ""masterpiece theater"". Horrendous editing kills more of the victims in the movie than the creatures do, and there are SO MANY characters I felt the movie should have included some sort of chart. For such a neat little myth, it was a terrible try at capturing it. The halfway done CG effects are just embarassingly laughable, as is the acting of everyone in the movie. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!"
1,WANTED TO STAB MY EYES OUT,"one home video camera + a family of ""actors"" + $75 = Bloodthirst:Legend of the chupacabras. i didn't want to rate this movie as high as one star, but there was nothing lower. if you want a horror movie, don't waste time or money watching this, but if you want some good laughs, the complete lack of reality in this movie will do the trick. the beginning of this film consists of bad acting, and a terrible camera crew. they literally use ketchup for blood (no exaggeration) and once you could actually see the bottle in a car mirror. in one scene a ""dead"" body's arm inexplicably raises itself, and no one seems to notice. let's just say that any mention of the word ""chupacabra"" sends my friends into peals of laughter. if you're looking for scary, this is not it, no matter how cool the cover is."
3,Remember the old 50's drive-in horror movies?,"The idea behind BLOODTHIRST: LEGEND OF THE CHUPACABRAS was to try and recreate the old fashioned, schlocky horror films of the 50's and 60's that were made on super low budgets and went straight to Drive-Ins. Half the fun of these films, of course, was laughing at their shortcomings. As filmmakers, that was our idea here...making such a film that would go straight to Video and DVD instead of the Drive-In. We think you'll like this one if you look at it in the right way and see it as a throwback to the old ""monster hunt"" movies. It's got some scares, some laughs and it's okay for the whole family. As TV's CINEMA INSOMNIA horror host MR. LOBO puts it: ""They're not bad movies; they're just misunderstood!"""
5,PERFECT SIZE CAKE FOR 2-4-6,"EVERY TIME I MADE A LARGER CAKE I HAD THE LEFTOVER TEMPTATIONS & WHO NEEDS THAT?WITH THIS SMALLER VERSION YOU MAKE A CAKE, EAT IT ONCE (OK - MAYBE TWICE) THEN ITS GONE. BETTER TO HAVE THE CAKE GONE THEN YOUR WAISTLINE GONE.THIS PAN IS A GOOD, HEAVY QUALITY.THE SHIPPING WAS A BIT MUCH BUT ISN'T IT ALWAYS?"
5,"Wonderful guitar, bass, harmonies","""Beat Angels"" has it all... great harmonies, bass, lyrics, melody. Sal Bernardi on acoustic guitar is tremendous. John Leftwich does a great job on bass on several of the songs. I definitely hear Leo Kottke's guitar playing and vocals. Brian Setzer's electric guitar on ""Rebel Rebel"" is inspired. Rickie's voice is just plain haunting throughout. High quality audio makes it a pleasure to listen to ""Traffic From Paradise"". This music give me the shivers. Wow! Thanks Rickie!"
4,the war of the crystals,A very well thought out and clever story line with good action hero. Very nice!
2,Disappointed,"I love jazz and am a big fan of John Pizzarelli, who produced this recording of his wife. I also thought I would be a big fan of Jessica Molaskey, having heard some great tracks of hers on the radio. This made my disappointment in this recording all the greater. This is simply over-over-produced. Jessica has a great voice, but if improvisation and spontaneity are the heart of jazz, this is not jazz. Dear John: can the strings and all the rest of the carefully orchestrated arrangements. Let her just sing from the heart with guitar (yours), piano, and bass as accompaniment."
1,Pedestrian,"A collection of songs, so boringly executed, that I view the experimental purchase as a ""well that didn't come out at all like I hoped"". No need to purchase/listen or otherwise consider this disc."
1,it's pathetic a movie,"Borat it's too vulgar for me and in reality none person in my culture would do the things that i see from Borat, specially with the restroom.I don't know his country but i don't wanna go there, oh jezz, what a pathetic place..."
2,Bore-it,"Clever idea, just not executed very well. The money it made does not speak well for Americans intelligence."
2,eeeew,Cohen is very funny but if you're at all squeamish this movie is not for you. Certainly not if you're older than 50. Squeamish humor - perhaps it deserves a genre of it's own.
4,Borat isNiiiiice!,My wife and I have been watching this guy do this schtick since D ali G show has been on HBO.It is good to see a talented comedian make it big. This is a one-of-a-kind film. Sometimes hilarious. Sometimes gross.But always mesmerizing.
3,Tried too Hard - ha ha,"After all the high praise Borat received I thought I needed to buy it. Once viewed, I wish I hadn't bothered. It's another crude and crazy money making scheme. Amusing in parts, but mostly crude bathroom type humor. I don't need a whole movie to tell me their are a bunch of messed up people in the world."
1,offensive and not funny,"I couldn't bear to watch the whole movie. Wow, I can't believe people actually found this funny, it's offensive and disgusting. Don't waste your money or your time."
5,"OH GIVE ME A BREAK, ALL YOU ""OFFENDED"" PEOPLE - THIS MOVIE IS HYSTERICAL!","I wasn't sure what to expect when watching this movie - I didn't know whether the people Borat meets in the movie were in on the joke or not, and I still am not sure. But I was pleasantly surprised at how ridiculously funny this movie is. The heck with political correctness - this movie is a riot! People who say the movie is ""offensive"" really need to lighten up!!!"
1,So much talk - so little to see,"In my opinion this movie does not worth the price of the ticket. It is hardly a movie, just a collection of poorly made episodes. Yeah, some of them make you smile, but there is no quality to it. I can't believe how many 5-star reviews are here, because of such reviews I went to see this ""movie"". I wish I had an option to have my money back after watching movies I don't like. I am definitely not buying the DVD."
1,One Laugh - One Star,"This is an over rated movie. I heard lots of good things about Borat but it just doesn't measure up. Wait till HBO runs it over and over, it might be funnier then."
1,"Bored with disgusted ""BORAT""","Filthy people makes some kind of movies which offend your basic human beliefs and values. Borat is just like one of that kind of ""cheap, trash, disgusting"" movie - too much rude, too much crude, trying to be over the top but ends up on the bottom. I doubt what kind of people gives so much critical acclaimation, awards, golden globe best actor and even an oscar for best screenplay for such a disgusting movie. Vulgar seeped in more vulgar and dipped in bad taste. Maybe it is over my head, but I wish I could have kept my head lower and missed the half I did see. I wish if I could give it zero star."
1,Un-funny and Offensive to all,i found this movie distastful and a waste of money. It not only made crude jokes at Jewish people but everyone of race and religion. I am sad to say i was one of the many who actually paid money to see this horrible movie...which i now regret.Just an overall bad movie
1,A burned copy?,The movie itself is great.The customer service from Amazon is terrible.I opened the box to discover a burned copy of the movie. I could have done that myself for fifty cents in late fees from my local library.Illegal copy and distribution of movies was frowned upon I thought.
1,This is a niiice and funny movie...pause...NOT!,"Too bad there isn't a ZERO stars rating. An embarassing, not sure of what it wants to be, 5 minute skit. Bad, boring, bloated.The mix of real emotions captured and the silly ""story"" did nothing for anyone I've talked to about this comedy.Striking is the fact that despite the slanted editing that showed some real ugliness by Americans, most tried to extend a caring hand to what they thought was someone in need. Pitiful."
1,Borat is Al Kydah!,I don't know what you liberal pinkos are thinking watching this terrerist movie! It's obvius that Borat traveled the God Bless USA to find out our weeknesses and where to hit us. Borat hates freedom! If you people keep watching stuff like this then your gonna make the terrerists win! Do you want that? If you like this crap you must hate America and George Bush should put you in guantamanos prison with all the other Al kydas! IDIOTS!!!!
5,Oxygen,"About 5 minutes in, I was out of breath and I was like that until the DVD had turned off. I am on the fence about shock humor but this was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I am wondering what his next project will be. Hence my title. Oxygen. I felt like I needed Oxygen watching this movie because I was so out of breath from laughing."
4,I loved it more than my teenager,"This movies is not PC. It is the new ""Blazing Saddles"". It suprises me that it has not been condemmed by the PC croud. It is satirical and funny. If you are easily offended then you won't want to watch it. It attacks below the belt.Very funny - NOT PC."
3,CRASS,"THE FAINT OF HEART SHOULD NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. IT PRETTY MUCH PLOWS ALONG THE VERY BOTTOM. BUT LIKE A CAR WRECK, YOU JUST HAVE TO WATCH..."
2,A pale copy of the TV Show,"I am a huge Ali G fan...and I loved the HBO show (5 stars out of 5). So I went to the movie expecting more of the same, and boy was I ever disappointed. The real problem to me is that too much of the movie (all of it?) was scripted. The genius of the TV show was that it was improv depending on what happened with the guests, usually with hilarious results. This movie on the other hand relies too much on scripted situations and you just get the feeling that they are trying too hard, whereas with the TV show things just flowed.Interestingly enough I found that people who loved the film had never seen the Ali G show, and that most of the people who had seen the show were disappointed with the film...count me among them.If you saw the film and have never seen the Ali G show, take my advice and check out both seasons and see if you don't agree with me.H777"
5,Don't know what it is but ....,Comedies that offend a great number of people are some of the funniest! Borat would shock me and then I would burst into laughter. I haven't laughed this hard in years. Absolutely hilarious.
4,Hilarious but mean-spirited. Many bonus features outshine the movie.,"We watched the DVD and many of its bonus features in one sitting. The movie is hilarious if you let go of any political correctness. We laughed out loud during many parts of the movie. However, a streak of meanness and condescension makes some of the scenes less palatable-- e.g., when Borat brings a plastic bag of poop to the table of a formal dinner. His hosts had been nothing but accomodating and understanding to him.Many of the bonus features were funnier than the movie itself. Baron Cohen actually stumped Conan O'Brien when he appeared on Conan's talk show. The spoof of Baywatch was hilarious. Outtakes of special note, which were funnier than the movie: Borat tries to adopt a dog from a pound; Borat visits a doctor and discusses his sexual habits."
2,Borat Does America,"Agreed that Americans are very gullible to the next trend. Borat is an example of how hype can make a bad film a success. I thought they tried too hard to be funny. I mean look at the morons he used in the film. Drunken, disgustingly stupid redneck college guys. Moronic manner-driven southern belles lost in the past. Small minded, gay hating rodeo fans. Annoying, overly serious convention attendees.The part where Borat shows a nude picture of his family to someone has been done in his TV show awhile back. It was funny the 1st time, but seemed tired now."
5,Outrageous movie!,"This movie is definitely for the mature audience who appreciates crude humor. Outrageous, wacky, unbelievable, hilarious, funny movie."
4,Borat,"I thought that this movie was supposed to be offensive and disgusting, but instead it showed the American public how perverse and subjective they are. It was humorous because it was taboo. I enjoyed the film thouroughly; however, I would not recommend the film for those who have a weak stomach or who have too weak of a mind"
5,FUNNY!,When I saw the trailer for Borat I thought it was going to be another stupid film but I was so wrong.You can't keep your eyes off of Borat because it is so FUNNY.If you like documenteries and Austin Powers you will love this and watch it over and over again.
3,Not worth owning,"I love the Ali-G series, I have a copy of the first two season from HBO...Super funny..Then I heard about the Film and was exstatic but I waited waited not watching it at the theater just to buy it to make the film that much funnier to me...NOT.This film is a dud, there are funny parts but not worth watching them over and over. This is a watch once film. The special features are the only funny part about this dvd and thats because they are broken up segments like the tv show. If you strung them all together to make a movie it would suck like the this dvd with the plot to find Pa-mella.The character Sache makes for Taladegqa nights is four times funnier than borat. Jishemesh, Chin-Queee."
2,"Throw This Movies Into Trashakanistan, Pleaz","I'm sooo glad I didn't pay to see this turkey. The initial idea was great, that's why 2 stars. I loved the beginning in Borat's native land and it was cute, but I was never laughing out loud. But it all downhill from there. Since everyone else has analyzed this thing to death, I'll only ask one question:Azamat: In the naked wrestling scene, where are his gonads? He is sans penis. I have watched the beginning a couple of times and I do believe that the ""woman"" who plays his short, fat nasty wife is Azamat. Azamat has female breasts and if you look close enough, I think a female actor was given a FX ""hair shirt"" and male balding pattern wig. The voices of the two characters are identical. Haven't read all 566 reviews, so if anyone knows some inside info, please clue us in. Azamat has been completely castrated otherwise.I don't know why this haunts me, but like the movie ""It's Pat"", it's bugging me to no end to know what sex Azamat really is........"
3,"Borat, a small disappointment","Borat was a movie that we couldn't wait to see because we love to laugh. It starts off funny in an all inclusive offensive manner and the get more offensive and vulgar and, definitely, not so funny anymore as the movie went on. They definitely pushed the envelope too far. So sorry we paid for this."
2,What Am I Missing Here?,"I notice that most of the reviews here are 5 star or 1. Very little in between. Rarely is anything *this* black or white.Yes, the film has un-PC moments. Nothing horribly offensive. Yes, it has a nekkid wrestling scene. No biggie. There are funny moments, but I wouldn't call it a funny funny movie - let alone the funniest movie I've ever seen. It's not even in the top 100.I liken the hype machine of this movie to the same people who did 'Napoleon Dyaminte'. It's a great build up for a fair-at-best movie, that leaves you scratching your head as to what all the fuss is about - but by the time you figure that out you've already rented or purchased the DVD."
2,Not Up To The Hype,"I had really expected to like this movie as the promo clips shown on TV looked hilarious. Unfortunately, the full movie does not live up to the hype and the humor wears thin very quickly. Borat is boring."
2,Just okay,"Maybe if I randomly stumbled upon this movie, I would have thought it was amusing. But after all the hype and attention, I found it just mildly amusing. Acting inappropriately just to get a response is great... for about 15 minutes. It wears thin for an entire movie."
4,Highly Recommend for a hearty laugh!,"Borat is about a fellow from Kazakhstan, who comes to America to meet Pamela Anderson, because she is in his wet dream, and he is completely in love with her. He documents his trip, and doesn't know anything about American culture, and as he travels across America, clashes with the culture in outrageous ways.Different from your average comedy, political humor, without being dry or obnoxious. It takes a stab at America, but not in a hateful way. Had several different elements of comedy; political, bathroom humor, crude humor, racist jokes, a broad span of what is considered funny.The acting on Ali G's part was really good, to a ""T"" - you completely believed his character, even though he was doing ridiculous things. Highly Recommend for a hearty laugh!"
1,BORAT,The most idiotic piece of Video I have seen in my life. Boring and tasteless too! A waste of money.
1,Dont spill another's blood,"This is shock-humor, justified with bogus arguements like ""he-is-turning-a-mirror-on-society.""People were hurt and embarrassed by this film. Real people. Like the poor people in the Romanian village which he tried to pass off as Kazak. Cohen wants to make a living by causing pain and exploiting simple people? He is no better than a Wall Street banker. He is supposedly Jewish. Well he has violated a Jewish tradition which is known as ""Don't spill another man's blood."" Which means... don't intentionally embarrass another person. He is a bad Jew, and a bad person."
1,Skip this one,"Just to warn you to save your money. What passes for jokes in this film - some are truly sick. Please go and buy a great book or music CD save your money, or enjoy it way more on something else. Thank you."
5,Almost too good to be true!,"Quite frankly the most hilarious movie ever made - it'll be a long time before anyone can top this one.While I agree it's exceptionally offensive, it is designed to offend everyone equally. Kudos to Sacha Baron Cohen, and his rotund sidekick, Ken Davitian!"
5,Hilarious!,"If you're uptight, don't see this film.If you know how to kick back and laugh like you've never laughed before, this is for you.Very Nice!"
1,Just plain stupid,"I bought this movie on DVD about one year ago. Such a waste of money! Totally stupid, not funny at all."
1,Absolute loser!!,"This movie was a waste of time. I read many reviews of it prior to buying it and was expecting something very entertaining, the media really hyped this one. It was a unique approach to a movie, that's about the only good thing I can say about it. There were times during the movie that I almost turned it off, but continued on expecting something of value somewhere in the movie. The scene where he runs around chasing a naked fat man is the most repulsive and gross thing I could imagine! Don't waste your money."
4,Pretty funny movie.,My husband and I enjoyed this movie. Found ourselves laughing quite a bit. There are points in the movie that are very inappropriate for young people. Overall a funny movie.
2,Do not waste your time watching this movie!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, not funny at all. The main charactor is very retarded and crazy, not human being."
2,"Couple of laughs, mostly tedious","I don't understand the national fascination with this. A few toilet jokes are funny, but the gross-out humor grows wearisome, as does the accent. Don't expect much and you won't be too disappointed."
2,Borat,"I like Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G, he is usually witty. In Borat however there is so much more he could have done to get a laugh, instead it just turned out to be basically offensive."
3,A bit overhyped,"Borat does have some funny moments (the best are actually in the outtakes) but it is SO non-PC it's humor and targets are completely obvious and act as expected. Some scenes are obviously staged, others not but after the set-ups most people will know where they are headed so the comic payoff is often diminished. Worth a look if you are in the mood, but not the comic masterpiece it is touted as being."
5,"Painfully funny. If you don't like this movie, you better check your pulse.","I laughed so hard in the movie theater that people were actually turning around and looking at me (and laughing because I was laughing!).It's not tasteless at all. It's pure genius. Yes, he pushes the envelope. Yes, he makes you feel uncomfortable at times. But THAT's one of the reasons why this movie is just so fresh and clever.If you don't think this movie is hysterically funny, perhaps instead I could recommend the 1980's TV series ""Full House"". All seasons are available on DVD right here at Amazon."
1,burn your money,Burn the $20 that you would spend on this DVD.It will be far more entertaining.Waste of time and money!
1,Not a thinking man's movie,"I watched this farce on DVD and turned it off after about an hour. Enough of this crude,offensive nonsense. I'm depressed and discouraged that I live in a world that finds this funny. It seems to me that the whole shtick was a rip-off of the Alex character inEverything Is Illuminated, which was an excellent film in which this character provides comic relief to a serious and very moving story. I can't imagine what value might be derived from watching Borat except perhaps to have one's level of consciousness lowered."
1,A really stupid endeavor,"That people enjoyed this film convinces me that Western civilization is doomed. For all of you who gush over this film, who earnestly dissect it around the water cooler with your buddies in your Dockers, thinking you're in the cool club because your a rung or two above the idiots Borat pranked.....psst, there's a cooler club laughing at you over at the other water cooler. Borat is about as funny as cancer."
2,Don't waste your time,"I considered turning this excuse for a movie off about half-way through. There are simply no redeeming features. Crude stereotypes of racial, ethnic and minority groups. Gratuitous bad language and nudity. A plot and story line that is laughingly improbable. Its beyond me how it got the press it did, and why Cohen was so lauded. I guess he plays the character the way the screen writer wanted him played, but that's small comfort. The acting overall is not bad considering that it was supposed to be a documentary of travel through the US, and the folks on the screen weren't supposed to be ""actors"". That's the reason I gave it 2-stars (""didn't like it"") instead of one! But its a bare 2-stars, maybe 2-minus! Save your money and time. Run!"
2,Borat,This book a most sensible acquisition if you are think of travel to this country and will instruct you on all you needing know.
1,Way to expensive!!!,$50.00.....REALLY?THAT'S SO WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!AND MOVIE STUDIOS WONDER WHY PEOPLE DOWNLOAD MOVIES FOR FREE ON THE INTERNET.
1,Don't waste your money,Glad I did not spend any cash to see this! Borrowed the DVD from a friend and had a few giggles but found it disturbing more than funny. Wasted an entire evening and can't get the crappy lines out of my head!
1,borat is a tiresome bore - good for a very few laughs,"Even if you like the Ali-G / Sacha Cohen / Borat schtick, this movie gets tiresome after a while - I fell asleep..."
1,"Bad taste, bad movie","A friend talked me into watching this fiasco. I not only didn't laugh once during the entire movie, I was repulsed. I am well known for being anti policical correctness, so my feeling have nothing to do with that. It was simply not a funny movie. Gross jokes abounded, but being gross does not automatically make it funny. I cannot reccommend this movie to anyone."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made! (would have given negative stars),"I recognize satire, when I see it. However, I am also able to recognize a heap of sh** (quite literally, because the movie is a lot about that stuff), and I do not need a critic trying to sell it to me as satire!I do not hold extremist views, but Borat has been the most awful movie I have ever had the displeasure to watch. If it is not the worst movie ever made, I think everybody should be able to agree on Borat being easily among the 10 worst movies ever made.The plot is so thin that it could be told in 2 sentences. There is no point to the movie, no morals, no nothing. The only thing that sticks out is the technique use to tell the story: it is in your face obnoxious, revolting, offensive, obscene, repugnant, disgusting, nauseating, filthy, etc.After coming out of the movie, I felt dirty. My wife and I canceled our after movie dinner plans!"
2,I wasn't offended,"But I was BORED. Not impressed at all. I think Cohen is actually very funny and inventive - I also think he could have done much better than this. Don't worry, I ""got it"", just fine - I need nothing explained to me. But in the end it was just . . . bad. The only thing I laughed at was the sound the chicken made when Borat threw his satchel to the ground in frustration. Seriously, that was the ONLY time I laughed."
3,Not so funny,I really loved the Borat character on an Ali G dvd I had but this movie was not as well developed and probably suffered for having to follow a tiny bit of a story.
1,Terribly Stupid,This was by far the stupidest movie I have ever seen. The things they did in the movie were disgusting and not even remotely funny. I would not recommend this film nor will I buy it for my collection. I can't believe it got nomminated for an Oscar.
1,Bor (ing) RAT,A few funny scenes but most of it is sophomoric humor found on bathroom walls. Film should more appropriately been called Bor(ing) RAT. Save your $15 and buy 15 Three Stooges Movies at the Dollar Tree.
1,"If you're looking for a comedy, pass on this one","I was expecting to laugh, laugh, and laugh some more when I rented this video. Instead, I waited for it to get funny and after an hour, decided to give up on the movie and turn it off. This was a horrible movie and I can not believe that it did so well."
1,"Offensive, Stupid, Not Funny, Short, Boring","This movie was not funny but revolting. I definitely did not know I was paying to see shots of a naked fat hairy guy and Borat with their balls in each others faces, masturbating, running, wrestling and fighting. It was anti-semitic-they showed Borat thinking that Jews ""shape-shift"" to cockroaches and then Borat throws money at them. They showed the running of the Jews and then an egg which is a baby Jew-they tell the little kids to attack the egg so the Jew can't hatch. It was 80 minutes-short, but not sweet. There were very few laughs in the movie. The plot is nonexistent. A waste of time and money."
2,What was all the fuss about?,"My older brother had seen this in the theater right before we all got together at Thanksgiving. He was telling us about how funny this movie was and even showed us clips on Youtube. So when I finally get around to seeing it on DVD, all I can say is what was all the fuss about?The DVD is mostly bathroom humor, candid camera and a few sight gags. He goes around filming this ""documentary"" for his homeland, and acts goofy and sees how people react. Some parts were funny, especially their fear of Jews, and how they portray them, and there were some sight gags if you caught them, like his producer telling him their bear got away, and later seeing the bear's head in the refrigerator in the background. Another was his speech at the rodeo saying he support our ""War of Terror"" with his poor English. But otherwise I found the movie pretty boring and childish."
1,Nothing new here,"I watched this the other day hoping to be nicely surprised by a movie that was actually funny. Unfortunately, it's not this one. There were one or two semi-funny things but they were by no means worth the 1.5 hours of watching to see.The fact that this movie made so much at the box office is a terribly sad example of how completely lame and undemanding our national sense of humor has become. When will 6th grade sex and gross out jokes stop being received so well by such a large percentage of people out there?Whatever happened to fame coming after a performer demonstrates real, substantive talent?"
1,OMG....This was awful!,"Years ago I thought that the Blair Witch Project would be the worst movie ever made. However, I was wrong. This is absolutely the worst piece of trash I have ever seen. Blair Witch actually got better after seeing it again, this movie can only get worse. Instead of an emmy, the director and cast should get life! If there is ever a sequal, I think I'll cut out my eyes. Thank goodness it was free as an Amazon reward.....Amazon rocks!"
1,borat,"The worst, most racist film in recent memory. It is sad that a racist element of the Jewish population are depicting Muslims in this light and that it ever made it to the big screen. It is sad that our children might see this."
1,Sorry everyone who liked this film,I walked out of the theater. I've done a lot of traveling in my day and the last thing non-traveling Americans need is bad stereotypes and lies.
1,Vulgar!!,"That movie is simply disgusting to say the very least. The vulgarity of it all is at its lowest level here. Thank God, I rented it instead of buying it!"
1,This movie is simply not funny...,"I have no problem with lowbrow humor. For example, I think ""Dumb & Dumber"" is a hilarious movie.I also have no problem with racial jokes, stereotypes, naked men wrestling, etc.The problem with this movie isn't that it is offensive. The problem with this movie is that it is SIMPLY NOT FUNNY. Trust me, if you are a person that has even a remote amount of intelligence and a halfway decent sense of humor, don't even bother watching this movie. It is a complete and utter waste of time and money (luckily I rented it rather than buying it)."
1,Waste of Time,"I finally saw the movie and don't understand what all the hype was about. I think I only laughed once. Actually, I was grossed out more than anything. There are so many things that go way beyond all sense of moral decency in this movie. There are references to incest, killing children, and being sodomized, just to mention a few. If you find these things funny, then you might find it funny. I did not."
2,Borat,The movie at first viewing was roll on the floor laughing. However when I realized the movie was made at the embarrassment and expense of unknowing people the appeal of the movie plummeted. The Jewish epithats were totally offensive and is not mitigated by the fact that he himself is a Jew. One positive note is it does show a good amount of graciousness of those in the southern states.Buy it used if you have to.
5,Tear jerker,You know how sometimes that you laugh so hard that you find you're crying? I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.
5,Conceptually brilliant sledgehammer comedy.,"A hilarious film with a serious message. It exposes people for what they really are.Borat is racist, anti-Semitic, anti-feminist and homophobic and he finds no shortage of morons willing to subscribe to his views.It's not offensive to Jews. Much like the Simpsons, it's offensive to absolutely everyone, but on a different level.That a British Jew like SBC can cause so much outrage, without the outraged understanding the irony, is pure genius.Sniiiice."
3,"Funny, but Borat was better on Da Ali G Show","First off, I am/was a huge fan of Da Ali G Show. Borat's segments on there were hilarious, much more improvisational and much more realistic. There were too many parts in this movie that were clearly scripted and set up. Much of Borat's witty, smart, tongue-in-cheek humor was sidelined for mindless slapstick humor. It was still funny, but for those who have known of Borat for a few years, this is not his best stuff. The movie WAS a little overrated."
4,Funny as Hell!!,"I'm not gonna go into detail, but this movie is funny as hell! I couldn't stop laughing, save for one scene that almost made me gag... you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it... But all around a funny movie worth the buy. Especially if your into Jackass or Jamie Kennedy type comedy."
5,Cutting edge humor,If you haven't seen this movie...watch it. You are seeing truly great comedic performance. Using the unexpected to create humor. Sacha Baron Cohen has created one of the funniest films in recent memory...in many cases using our own ignorance as the knife that opens the bag of laughs.Great film.
5,Much Needed Satire - It's 'Jackass' with a Moral...,"Toilet Humor aside (which is still extremely funny) - this Movie is a masterpeice.Sacha Baron Cohen drags to light the stereotypes that the politically correct world would have us believe no longer exist. While you will roll with laughter and be offended countless times; dont lose sight of the underlying message. At some point during the movie the stereotype will turn on you, and when it does... pay attetnion to how it makes you feel. If you find yourself saying 'Well - that's not right, or that's not true' remember that evereyone else said the same when the joke was about them. The PC world pretends these feelings dont exist, but the beahvior modification has only buried these ill ideaologies - not solved them. Brilliantly done in a style that certainly appeals to the younger generation - The intelligent viewer just might learn more about the negative affects of racism and stereotypes than they ever will in school."
2,just ok,this film didn't move hardly at all. as a matter of fact this film for me was predictable within the first half hour of it going on. I don't find Cohen that funny on a whole. all the stereotype situations gets tired real fast. I watched his Ali G show and truth be told he pretty much does the same thing over&over on a whole. had he truly challenged himself this might have been worth seeing instead of being predictable.
3,Mildly Humorous,"I expected a subtle yet humorous parody of the USA and its politics, but I guess that's what I get for only seeing the ads for this movie without ever seeing any of the actor's other works. The film was mildly amusing, but if you took out every joke related to sex, bodily functions, and homosexuality, the movie would've only been ten minutes long. I actually enjoy some of the crude humor on shows such as South Park, but this film was just too far over the top. If they were trying to make a film that only appealed to 14-year-old boys, I'd say they accomplished their goal. My advice? Watch it once, chuckle a little, then forget all about it."
2,embarrassing,"Sascha Baron Cohen's ability to take innocent people and expose them as absurd cultural stereotype is unmatched. Thank God no one else does this. It's disgusting and an embarrassing product of Hollywood and America. We should revise our education so that we can produce uplifting art, not this trash."
5,This is hilarious,"I could watch this over and over and still be laughing! I love this movie! If you are looking for a great laugh, rent this one!"
2,It just went too far....,"I know good satire can be ugly, but this was just too mean-spirited to tickle my personal funny bone, and too raunchy for my comfort level. A few belly laughs for sure, and some sweet moments, too, but I just couldn't get past the high-octane offensiveness."
4,Rip Roaring fun.....,"This is a funny film with Sacha Baron Cohen doing a fantastic job creating his character, Borat.Alot of people are suing him for their ugly truths. All he did was capture it on film. Rush to Watch &don't be afraid to laugh."
4,outrageous?.. yes..vulgar?.. yes..Absurd?..yes..Entertaining?.. yes..,"Borat will surely divide its viewers.. it is not intended to be a pc film exploring cultural differences.. it is rather a complete violation of everything pc and brings out the worst in our international relations.. But it is endearing, very funny, and its explorations of the american psyche are spot on.. I found myself more often than not laughing at the American's who confront something different than themselves and bring out the worst stereotypes of Americana.. Borat is one of the most outrageous and totally relevant portrayals of international relations in the history of cinema.. Sacha baron cohen is hilarious in his absurd yet sympathetic portrayal of Borat.. a man completely out of place who always says the wrong things according to the other culture.. I found myself thinking as much as i was laughing.."
2,A GUYS MOVIE,Yes it made me laugh a few times-which is why I am giving it any stars at all--it takes a lot to make me laugh---the rest I found-boring-college like-offensive....If I was a guy drunk in college I probably would have liked it.....
2,and the punchline is this...,"Plenty of the humor in Borat is funny. Andy Kauffman would be proud that his ""foreigner"" humor is being recycled so heavily.But there is also a lot of the type of ""humor"" that makes people laugh because they feel uncomfortable- the same kind of laughter that someone may have when they are being tickled relentlessly, or worse, when someone is being picked on for their flaws (there's a big difference between that and self-deprecating humor). It isn't really funny, it's just embarrassing and/or demoralizing.Besides that, Borat and the other characters of Sacha Baron Cohen work fairly well in small doses, but overall this movie tries way too hard to break out of it's usual 10 minute segment. The movie loses a bit of it's steam half way through.I laughed through plenty of it, but I also left with an unsatisfying sense that the biggest joke in the movie was on the viewer."
1,Put Borat out of it's misery!,"If you gave a group of boys, aged 10 - 12, a couple of million dollars and the freedom to make any film they wanted, Borat would be it!I'm not a prude. I grew up with the off-color humor of Redd Foxx and Belle Barth. They were FUNNY!Borat is simply sophomoric, crude, and rude, pretending to be satire.View this dog at your own peril!"
1,Yuck!,In my opinion: This is absolutely the worst movie I ever started to watch. It was boring and gross. I ditched it after an agonizing 20 minutes. Don't buy it!
1,Immoral -- Unclear -- Misintegrated,"As a piece of art, this movie fails on three objective standards:1. Subject Selection: The film properly selects some of the worst aspects of American culture for mockery, yet mixes it with innocent victims in ways that lead to moral grayness.2. Clarity: The film does not clearly distinguish staged from unstaged scenes.3. Integration: While smoothly integrating all scenes, real or otherwise, using the humorous plot device of sexual infatuation, the end result amounts to misintegration rather than authentic integration. Although much more engaging than a fully disintegrated ""plotless"" approach, this very engaging nature makes it that much more dangerous as a cultural influence. Its box office success reflects its effectiveness as a work of misintegrated art.I cannot honestly recommend watching this movie in the theater. If you have an insatiable curiosity, wait until the film comes to DVD and you can get a good deal through your local rental store."
1,Borat,"The little we heard about this film gave us the impression that it was funny and charming, so my husband bought the DVD. Forty-five minutes into it, we threw it into the trash. And we are neither prudes nor religious zealots.End of story."
3,Homophobic? Racial? Anti-Feminism?,"I saw it in the theaters, it was an okay film if you ask me. Some humorous and some were really funny. But having to add Homophobia, Racial and Anti-Feminism was just enough...Seriously. Some people found it funny, I thought it was stupid. So overall, its an okay film if you want to laugh then never watch again. Cause it gets boring the 2nd time."
1,borat,The dvd is not an original the dvd just says borat in permanent marker. The paper int the front cover is just computer paper.
1,Oh puhleeez,"Ultimately, puerile and mean-spirited. Comic touches (the chicken, the enlarged ""black dot"", etc.,etc.) vastly overshadowed by pulling-the-wing-off-flies juvenile cruel deceptions and pointless potty jokes"
1,Horrible,"Yo.I loved the show on HBO. It is like my favorite.I found this movie to lack that bite I was looking for.It was like old jokes from the TV show.I guess this movie is for people who like The Family Guy. Kind of dumb and like to eat chicken all day long, with grease all over their lips and other dumb stuff.I walked out. Not becasue it was offensive.Because it wasn't funny. Not like the TV show.Total let down.And it was kind of scary. The auidence was just eating it up.Why?I felt alone in the world.Scared.It wasn't funny.Maybe if you haven't seen the TV show, you may have liked it.I guess check that out and you'll see what I'm talking about.America, America....Whew....If there was one piece of genius in this movie, it would have been watching America watch it.We are pretty stupid.Especially those liberals who laugh when any makes a Bush joke. Don't get me wrong. I'm no Bush fan. But I'm no jerk fan either.And that's what you are.A big jerk."
1,Ghastly.,"This was the worst film of the past twenty years. I am amazed that it wasn't direct to DVD. It had a single joke; a Kazakh country bumpkin travelling around ignorant of U.S. customs, bringing out the worst in everyone he came in contact with. It was pretty much used up in the first ten minutes, then became a painful exercise in repetition. By any aesthetic, this movie was so repulsive as to cause an aversion to ever seeing Sasha Baron Cohen in anything ever again.You do not want to be eating when Borat and his producer get into a fight sans trousers because the producer was 'making hand party' on a Pamela Anderson magazine. There is no redeeming social value in a naked, hiruste, over-weight man 'making hand party', or fighting with a naked, skinny, hirsute man."
1,Offensive,"Tasteless, Offensive and Stupid; Borat makes Pauley Shore look like a comedy genius. How anybody but a frat boy finds this stuff even mildly amusing is beyond me. Playing on people's kindness and patience, insulting everyone with not the least shred of intelligence or satire behind it, and trying to revive every bodypart and poop joke ever invented.....what a pathetic waste of time."
1,This is funny?,"Borat is great at showing how low American movie making has gone. I noticed that most professional reviewers top ten lists were half filled with foreign films for 2006. Borat is a great example of why. I am an open minded person. Rocky Horror and Requim for a Dream are not for the squeemish or closed minded, yet I love both. But Borat is just crass and uncomfortable. That a person can stoop so low as Sasha is so disturbing that it does make you laugh - out of embarressment. The fact that it gets so much press is doubly disturbing. Let's be kind and accept the sexual sister kissing, the running of the Jews, the purchase of Jew killing guns and the butchering of the national anthem. The naked fight in the hotel is about the most disgusting thing I've ever seen and so far from funny as to not even being worth consideration. I hope to never see Sasha again."
2,Disappointing,"The premise of the film wasn't bad, and the character of ""Borat"" is very entertaining but it just seemed to me to be unnecessarily vulgar. I was more impressed with the parts of the film that did NOT employ feces or incest as gag devices than with the film's efforts to ""one-up"" itself to see how much more tasteless it can get as the story unfolds. For instance, the elevator scene was pretty good and the discussion with the feminists was hilarious. But other parts just left me cold.A movie I like I can watch a dozen times. This one I could barely get through the first."
1,Don't see what all the hoopla is...,"Hearing so much about this movie (i.e. ""the funniest movie of the year"" or such hype), I couldn't wait to finally see it. There were a few chuckles here and there, but mostly stuff that probably seemed a lot funnier on paper such as ""Borat"" not knowing how to properly use the toilet and needing help from the socialite. While I expected to be offended from time to time, the real trouble in this movie, to me, was that it just wasn't very funny."
5,hilarious!!!!,just watch it. the deleted scenes to be included in this dvd are supposed to be great. funniest movie in a long time.
1,part sleeze part criticism,I am not sure if this worth the money. I am not even sure if this worth renting. Because the criticism burried under so much sleeze it is not even visible.
2,five stars for humor- negative 3 stars for inappropriateness,"The guy is a sick puppy. But a lot of the stuff is funny. I don't like how he messed up the national anthem and made fun of us in general, but Ali-G is a pretty funny guy and his pranks are outragious."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This movie was horrible. It has no story and is insulting to people from other countries. The worst was the 15 min long fight scene between two naked men. This movie is horrible. Please do not waste your time. If you wish to see a movie that insults other cultures as well as our own, a movie devoid of any thought you should watch this movie."
2,A dumbed-down version of the smart HBO show,"""Borat"" is like a car crash that draws in the lowest common denominators. It's like Cohen had a brain cramp and figured the best way to stretch his tv material into a movie was to remove the more clever ideas and add more boorishness and vulgarity (which he also seemed to do with the Ali G. movie.) Sadly i think the reason this movie did so well in this country is that many of the people that he was trying to make fun of didn't get his jokes. If anything, he overestimated the intelligence of the American public. How else can you explain two terms with the worst president ever and morally reprehensible war. Then again, maybe Cohen did know what he was doing. Either way, the joke is on us Americans. Perhaps we'll wake up and see what a mess we've made once the housing and stock markets collapse. We don't realize that the part of the world that doesn't already hate us isn't laughing with us so much as laughing at us."
1,Stupid,What a waste of time. The movie could hae been made much funnier and applicable to more than just moronic people that laugh at fart jokes. I will never watch again.
1,Borat DVD scam,The offered DVD is a very heavily edited version of the theatrical release with the only thing funny being the looks of boredom on the faces of those watching it. The additional material promised on the jacket is not on the disc. AVOID THIS RIPOFF
1,Not my kind of humor.,"I looked forward to seeing this for weeks, but MAN was I disappointed. I just don't find humor in making fools out of other people."
1,Don't Go There!,"The fact that so many people find this film funny and great is yet another example of how much modern society is disintigrating. Or maybe the people loving this are 10. Thank goodness I did not spend good money seeing this in a theater (I would have walked out) but only rented it and was able to turn it off after 20 minutes. Nothing about this was funny, especially Sacha Baron Cohen."
2,overrated,"does not meet expectations raised by commercials, as a matter of fact the commercials are the best scenes"
1,I Just Don't Get It,"After all the critical acclaim for this film, I couldn't resist buying it. A total waste of money. I don't have a problem with crude humor, but this movie is simply not funny. I kept waiting for the laughs to begin, but no luck. Don't waste your money or more importantly, your time."
4,"If you expect this to make sense, you don't get it!","Crazy, insane and ridiculous fun. There is no way to describe this unless you've seen it. Borat is certifiable ( as in insane)."
2,Not sure I will ever watch it again.,Funny in a disgusting twisted way. I'll probably give this one to my grown up kids for safe keeping.
1,Borat - Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,Total disappointment. Wish we would have turned it off rather than endure whole film.
5,An Excellent Comedy,"This movie is absolutely hilarious! It was crude and absolutely brutal, and the laughs never stopped coming. Sacha Baron Cohen uses the bigotry of his character, Borat, to expose the prejudices and ignorance of the unfortunate souls he meets on a trip through ""U.S. and A;"" all to great effect.On a side note, ""Borat"" is in no way insulting to the people of Kazakhstan. Baron Cohen simply chose a country that most people in America would not know the first thing about. It is just a way of tricking them into letting their guard down and making fools of themselves. And really now, you would have to be pretty stupid to believe any of the stuff he says about Kazakhstan.See this RIGHT NOW!!!"
1,cultural rubbish,"A waste of money and a waste of talent. A few funny scenes (like the one where Borat tries to check into a chic hotel after ""learning"" to dress and speak like a bunch of boyz he met on the street). A couple of unsuccessful tries at scat' humour and a far too long naked battle - with his offensively ugly co-actor - of no interest at all and most of the rest is just shovels and shovels of rubbish. I really don't understand how this ever got into theatres. I will gladly give the DVD away to anyone who will pay for the postage."
1,A dissapointing movie,"When this movie was at the movie teathers I really wanted to see it but I didn't have time. There were a lot of comments about how good was this movie, so I had great expectations. But... all that I have seen in the DVD is a boring history with jokes stereotyping USA and countries from East Europe, showing only the worst part of very valuable and rich cultures."
5,Wonderfully Satirical,"Sacha Baron Cohen stars as Borat, a television icon from Kazakhstan. He is sent to America to learn what and how we do things here and to bring those lessons back to his native home.This however is the simple explanation of it. The movie however is quite interesting in it's own respects.Borat travels from New York down to Texas and though to California travelling far for his love (in the form of Pamela Anderson). From insulting feminists to praising our 'War of Terror' Borat is certainly an eye opener.This is a movie I would recommend to people who enjoy laughing through an entire movie and those who can laugh without fear of being unpolitically correct. If you are someone who can get offended at something, you will in Borat.And for those of you who don't know, Cohen himself is a British Jew. So the anti-Semitism within the movie is meant to be funny."
4,Funny,"Disgusting as times. But hilarious. If you like Sacha doing this character, you might also like him as Ali G. Check out the Ali G tv show but avoid the movie."
3,"Inventive, funny and Crass","Certainly different, its Jackass gone funnier and more inventive. But also Crass and Vulgar.Its worth a look.But not Must-see."
2,lost interest,"i expected to enjoy this as much as i did the ali g episodes that contain borat segments. instead i got bored after 20 minutes. it's not as savagely funny as those segments that inspired the film. i had huge expectations, but i became utterly bored, never laughing after borat left for the us and a. i can't believe i'm writing this, as i expected this to join the ranks of my all-time favorites."
2,Missed opportunity,The first few minutes of this movie had me rolling on the floor. That laughter was quickly replaced by gasps of horror. Had the film stayed on course with Borat poking fun at himself this could have been a great film. Instead his tactics of inciting others by poking fun at them resulted in me turning off the film after only 15 minutes. This film goes way beyond being unpolitically correct.
5,Amazing,"This movie was everything I hoped it would be and so much more. It was probably the second funniest thing I've ever seen next to Team America World Police. It had points that would make anyone uncomfortable, but all in all, it was as close to perfect as you can get."
2,I am be making 5-star review for glorious cinematic film -- not!,"I watched this movie with my 21-year old son, who enjoyed it a lot more than I did. While it is effective as a horror story about the profound ignorance and deep-seated prejudices of the Americans it caught 'Candid Camera'-style, this would have been better as a 5-minute skit on 'The Daily Show'. It relies far too much on toilet/gross-out bits for laughs, which in a very limited form appeals to the 15-year old in all of us. However, in a full-length movie it just doesn't cut it.I recall watching an episode of Tom Green's old TV show wherein he was suckling the mammary gland of some bovid (!) and asking the camera, ""Is this comedy?""No, Tom, it isn't. And neither is 'Borat'."
2,Crass does not automatically equal funny,"I was very unimpressed with this movie. ""Borat"" suffers from the same delusion as Sarah Silverman in thinking that crass or politically incorrect AUTOMATICALLY equals funny. It does not. Of course sometimes it can be hilarious (and Borat does have moments like that), but overall I did not find this movie particularly funny or even amusing. Especially the scene where the naked friend sits on Borat's face was downright disgusting and it dragged on and on and on. At some point I just fast forwarded it. You're not missing much if you don't watch this movie."
1,The Anti-Comedy,"Sacha Baron Cohen can be a talented performer, but ""Borat"" is 82 minutes of sheer hell masquerading as a satiric ""mockumentary."" The results are too vulgar and calculated to be funny. Since many critics admire this film, it's simply a matter of taste. However, do not confuse ""Borat"" with any form of comic genius."
4,Crazy but funny,"Crazy, slapstick, but funny, Will be a classic in its own way. Don't expect great art, just something different. I liked it."
1,"At first, funny; but then goes too far","Harmless miscommunication between differing cultures can be funny; but not when it hurts, humiliates, or is just plain unsanitary. I found this movie to be far too over-the-top and disingenuous."
3,Had its moments...,"I've heard all the hype about this movie for months...so i rented it before i bought it and i'm glad i did, dont get me wrong its worth checking out cuz its has its moments when it was funny and when it was very digusting (the fat naked dude)If you have not seen it yet rent and see if you like it, i enjoyed but i dont seeing myself watching it again"
2,what's the point of this mindlessly exaggerated movie?,"the whole movie is a farce not even a melodrama. something funny but didn't bring out faithfully except exaggerated ten time more. the borat character didn't deliver a believable and realistic person but a would-be one. i didn't find anything that supposed to look funny but stupidly playing dumb and dumber with out-dated exaggerations. i've heard that russia has denied a release permit to allow this stupid movie shown in russian theaters in case to cause unpredictable protests and chaos to the people this movie targeted from. something wrong with the media people, they not only produced the 'jackass', 'dirty sanchez', they also produced this stupid 'borat' that i could never find it funny but repulsively disgusting."
2,This movie is gay,Sacha Baron Cohen is not funny in this movie. I found myself laughing maybe twice during the entire movie. It is way to hyped up by the immature audiences. This is not a good movie at all!
1,Do not watch this! Please!,"I really think this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I like parodies, I like cheesy action movies and I like intense slasher gore flicks. In all honesty I would rather watch paint dry. This movie is just disgusting, one scene with a fat guy doing something to himself is just not ""funny"" .Stay away"
1,"movie, borat","the movie wasn't original. only the box was original. i'm glad i got only for few dollars, otherwise i'll return the said item."
3,"Part genius, part crap","I'll keep this short. The send-up of American society: genius. The scenes on the subway, with the ""humor instructor"", the feminists, at the rodeo, at the southern mansion, in the RV with the frat boys: all great. What is crap are all the stupid scripted ""Will Ferrell"" moments which involve Cohen running around nude or nearly nude, especially the infamous nude wrestling match with his obese manager. These are just lazy, classless attempts at comedy, intended to keep the low-life members of the audience, who can't appreciate satire, occupied. I don't know exactly who started this trend of male comedians taking their clothes off to get cheap laughs, but I wish it would stop."
4,Attention Getter,I get lots of comments about my antenna topper and it makes finding my car so much easier especially in a large parking lot
1,Horrible DVD transfer,"This is not a review about the film itself but the Alpha Video transfer: it's horrible. Really horrible. In fact, I believe this a complete ripoff. Who in their right mind believes that the transfer on this DVD is anything close to watchable? I'd like to see the folks from Alpha Video sit through it and try to watch it. I'm sure they could not watch it for more than 5 minutes.Avoid this DVD at all cost. Hopefully the film will have a presentable transfer one of these days."
5,Noa,"This is one of the most wonderful singers I have ever heard. Her CDs are so relaxing, but yet don't bore you to death like some of the others. I have personally sang with her during one of her tours. She came to our school and picked us to sing with her. If you ever have the chance, go see her in concert. She will be touring this year in the US and other countries. I love all of her CDs!"
4,An important piece of aviation/space history,"The late Milton Thompson gave us in this book the privilege of an insider view of the X-15 program, mixing some technical information (rather little) with the planning and operation of the flight program, all intertwined with piloting stories and anecdotes. The text could most certainly use some editorial work to improve several aspects (amongst them, a quick rearranging of the chapters would yield wonders), but this does not really detract much from the historical significance of the book. The print quality is not the best on this edition, both for text and pictures.Unfortunately too few of the X-15 pilots choose to write about their experiences, thus this book will remain a reference work for this innovative aviation/space program - recommended."
5,Not to be missed,Can I be more succint. This is one of the best aviation or space books ever. Do not accept substitutes.
5,durable,I leave this outside all year long and after two years the only sign of wear is a cigarette burn.
1,Probably the worst book I've ever read.,"I found this book to be a complete struggle. It was stylistically ambitious, but far beyond the abilities of Winter to actually handle. When I peeled away the style and looked at the meat of the story it didn't surprise me to realize there was nothing there. A waste of time and money."
1,Ouch,"What a painful experience that was. I couldn't even finish this book, it didn't hold my attention, the characters were badly drawn and the plot was flimsy."
1,"Turgid, pretentious, amateur slop.","Style massively over substance, this is one of those books where you scratch your head and wonder how it ever got published in the first place. The premise of a gun runner, while not exactly original, is original enough for you to wonder what the new twist is to make it worth your while. The surprise was to find there is no new twist, unless you consider it clever story telling to take a genre usually associated with two dimensional characters and strip them down to one feeble dimension. The whole thing reads like an out of touch middle aged lawyer had decided to play cool, hip, author in his spare time. Here's hoping his caseload increases."
2,RUN...from this,"Would it be that hard to add quotation marks? This style of writing is terrible! The story-if you can get through it-is quite good. The fact that this author uses no quotation marks makes for a slower read. It slows the reading down immensely when you have to stop and figure out 'is this narrative or a character talking?' This seems to me to be lazy writing as opposed to artistic writing. I do not recommend this book for that simple reason. I do, however, recommend that you read an excerpt before you seriously consider purchasing this book. In my opinion there is way too much dialogue in this book to be written in this manner"
4,Good instructional design text,"This is a pretty good instructional design text. The model is not that revolutionary in instructional design, but for education used to older models of curriculum design, I imagine the ideas might be very revolutionary. It's a practical, usable book."
4,The Austro-Hungarian viewpoint,"The origins of World War I, and key diplomatic events during the war, from the perspective of a senior Austro-Hungarian diplomat. It does not purport to be a complete history -- for example, he does not mention the ""Zimmerman telegram"" and its impact -- but relates those events of which the author had first-hand knowledge from his perspective. Well-written and -translated. A must-read for the serious student of the Great War"
2,Already been done!,"First of all don't get me wrong here, I truly enjoyed some of the material on this project but when I saw these guys in Atlanta around 1999 and they were known as 4 Shades of Black, there was another member (KB) who had a very deep voice and a unique sound which added that touch that this album seems to be missing. You see the Boyz II Men and Shai thing has already been done. You must have that extra something within your sound that really sets you apart and they lost that in my opinion. I have done A & R work for several labels and these guys sound d*#n good but they need that other guy back. I saw KB in 2004 @ the Midtown Music Festival in Atlanta and he was currently working on his project and it sounds exactly like what 4Shades could use to make their sound more universal. I would really love to hear all of them together again and show these other groups how its supposed to be done."
3,"for a penny, its great","Ordering online can be very cryptic when you can't see pictures of exactly what you are ordering. I have tons of luck with used books and this is the first that kind of startled me. very little damage to the front cover (mind you it is the old cover, not the one pictured) and it has some kind of mold or old water damage on the last 60 pages yet is still readable so just want to inform others. I did have very prompt order confirmation along with speedy shipping and I get what I pay for when it only cost me a penny :)"
1,did i miss something?,"Was it just me, or were several parts of this movie patched-together segments from other movies? I counted at least three other movies in this one. Way to stay under budget guys."
2,Evil lies in the gutter,"with this pathetic story of two girls who end up drugged and about to be sold into white slavery for most of the movie. They are sold out by a high school friend, whom one of them is dating at the time. He sends them to a strip club where they are drugged, they audition on stage, then pass out only to wake up caged with a handful of other girls who all fell into the trap by dating e same man. The ONLY good part about this movie is the onstage strip audition... especially the blonde haired girl."
5,The series reboot we've all been waiting for.,"Thundercats, to many, represents all that was good about childhood: wildly imaginative and action packed. The reboot takes all that was wonderful about the previous iteration and adds gorgeous animation, top notch story-telling, and a darker theme to create a truly unique experience.For both fans of the previous series and newcomers alike, Thundercats 2011 is a fantastic experience. I can't wait to see what the creative team has in store!"
3,Kids liked it,Just didn't really follow the original storyline. I couldn't get into it. I don't recommend if you were a fan of the original and disappoint if your expecting...
1,Put it In The Litterbox,"Pure, absolute, unadulterated Anime CRAP. Horrible voice acting and cheap slave labor asian animation makes this little diddy something to pass on completely. They managed to take a marginal cartoon from the 80's and make it even worse. Spend your time cleaning out a litterbox at the SPCA it will be far more memorable and stink far less than this garbage."
5,That's whats up!,"This is my kind of episode, one of the best. It showed to be a true leader, you have to be humble."
4,Great wrench set,"Very nice finish, the pouch is great too for throwing the set in the toolbox and not worrying about mixing them up with other tools. I haven't really abused them yet, but they seem like a great set. I would recommend it."
3,Wth?,"Feel like great tools but the 1-1/8"" wrench came with a horrid blemish where the chrome didn't take. It was even facing out when I unwrapped them. This wouldn't get past any QA department so Denali really must have ZERO Quality Assurance!Funny thing is I also got a metric set and there was something wrong with that one as well! Sigh..."
5,Great Read,"The book is fantastic. The breadth, insight and analysis as well as the easy to read and easy to understand makes this book unique. Its like a practical application of an economic textbook. I love many of the quotes and will refer to this bok very often."
1,next to worthless,Baum's bio seems to have vanished from Wikipedia. Last I saw it there I don't think there was any mention of any training as an economist. I believe she majored in movie criticism at university. Her columns at Bloomberg seem mainly reactionary pieces of misinformation. Whenever I checked out her assertions vs. the data she didn't come out well. I think she has lots of far right wing opinions and not much knowledge of economics to back them up. I am not taken in.
3,tippy pan,I like the size of this pan but the rounded bottom makes it tippy on my gas range. I prefer the square bottomed sauce pans.
3,Perfect except needs a lid,"A 1 qt pan is really handy, now if this one only had a lid available for it, I'd give it 4 stars. (Missing one more star for having a straight lip instead of one you can pour from.)All Clad does make a 1qt sauce pan which does have the lid, but not the pouring lip. And a Winsor pan (1.75 qt) with lid and lip, which I favor over this one. It's not a bad pot, it just could be better."
3,All Clad stainless 1-quart,"Its a perfect pot to heat a can of soup in, wide and shallow allows for quick heating. I have to say I was a bit dissappinted after washing it, because it seems to have lost it shine to it. Not sure why that is the case. Functional but no longer a thing of beauty."
3,Watch out for the tipping!,"This is a nice saucier for very small jobs but BE WARNED- you have to keep an eye on this pan when using it on gas stoves since the handle is so much heavier than the body. The base of the pan is smaller than the top (since that is the basic shape of the saucier pan) so the surface area is just not sturdy on the stove grates. I have tipped it and spilled out the contents MANY times while using it. If you have to reach for an item and don't hold the handle or balance it just right on your burner, it goes over VERY easily and makes a mess! Beautiful pan, but I don't use it too much because of that fact. Perhaps the larger volume 2 or 3 quart saucier would be a better, more useful buy."
5,Great little pan for small jobs,"This is a very well made, sturdy pan that should last for many years. I use it mainly for heating up sauces (as the name suggests) or heating some green beans, lima beans, or peas. It really is the perfect size for my small family. It would also be a nice pan for you to try if you are thinking about investing in one of the All-Clad cookware sets. That way you can test the construction of the All-Clad brand before taking the plunge and spending $500 on a set."
2,"Interesting, introspective, but for fans only","Here's another highly personalized entry by this great balladeer of the classic period; he's the co-Producer and his name is all over the songwriter(s) credit fields.Unlike another King project, ""Love Is Gonna Get You"", this one is weighted down with draggy, metronomic beats, and a voice mix (both lead and chorus) which occasionally makes listening difficult - this important artist has written some (to me) non-commercial but compelling lyrics but you can't hear them! Another issue is that he takes a non-Ben E. King approach by using alot of whispering effects where you would expect his tenor to soar.""You Still Move Me"", authored by Dan Seals and ""It's All Right"", by Curtis Mayfield are the best cuts, although even on these more engagaing opuses, there's that same monotony.The best original track is the closer, ""T'm Gonna Be Somebody"", good lyrics, well-delivered."
5,Great quality kickplate,"I bought an inferior product from the local mega chain store and it was flimsy and plated. I traded it in on this baby, solid brass, heavy, quality. Looks great on my door."
3,"Looks terrific, but coating is not that good","These looked great... but the more it was handled (cleaning and scuffing), it started tarnishing, and I could not improve it. I should not have bought the polished/coated... shiny brass is too sensitive. Will try Brushed stainless steel."
5,Whoa! Are we listening to the same album?,"I'm amazed at the negative reviews. Of course they have a right to their opinion, but I'd love to know what the reviewers weren't hearing that I am. This album really travels, and has a fun, celebratory energy."
2,A boring album,"Pat Metheny is a creative genius in the jazz world, but this album totally misses....it's boring, despite all the enthusiasmfrom the audience."
2,Skipping Problem Negates Other Qualities,"The picture and audio quality of this unit is excellent, and the PAL-NTSC conversion was one of the best I'd seen to date. However, about every third DVD the unit would freeze up and/or skip for no apparent reason, and it would occur on both new and used DVDs. I did some more research and discovered others who've bought this unit have indicated they experienced the same problem. Since the freezing/skipping problem appears to be rather common, I would recommend against buying this model."
4,First time with multi-region player hits a homerun,"This was my first experience with a multi-region player and I fully expected the worst. I have been very pleased, however, with its performance. I got the player so I could view Region 2 dvds I got on ebay from the UK. The very first disc seemed to speed up slightly in the audio in a couple of places. Since that one time, I've played it for hours with no problem whatsoever. A great find. I gave it 4 out of 5 since I want more than a month's use before calling something great."
4,"Cool features, decent performance.","I really love how this DVD player is capable of playing AVI files burned onto a DVD-R or CD-R. I also love the photo slideshow capability. As my wife is from Germany, the region-free function is great. But I've noticed some quirky behavior that is a little annoying. When watching a DVD, even a store-bought one, it seems that the player flakes out when a scene changes in a movie or show. I don't know if it's a problem with chapters, or if the abrupt change in video signal causes it to hang for a second, or something else entirely. Otherwise, it's a nice machine that can do some amazing things."
3,Pretty good pure rock album,"I see that some like it and some don't, for myself, I think this is a good rock cd, not a masterpiece but still worth the listening.The guitar playing of Jimmy Page is great and Coverdale's voice is without a doubt a good rock vocalist. If you like Led Zep, I think you should give this one a try and who knows, maybe you'll like it !"
3,A Couple of Real Blues Would've Helped,"I remember so looking forward to this release back in 1993.My favorite aspect of early Zeppelin was the way Page and the boys took the blues and made them bigger than life.I had always admired Coverdale's vocals, starting with his Purple debut--especially on ""Mistreated"".Keeping all this in mind, I fully expected these guys to include a couple of straight, slow blues tunes--perhaps one in a major key and the other minor.That didn't happen, and to this day that missing element is what keeps me from giving it a higher star rating.This CD could've been great.ASJ"
4,"Conspicuous lack of soloing,yet the song remains the same.","One can never know whether this was an attempt to relive past glories,but one thing is sure:this is one brilliant album where the chemistry between Page and Coverdale is hard to understate.Coverdale's voice is a tad lower than usual which fits very well the bluesy overtones of this album,coming across as a curious,yet surprisingly pleasant hybrid of old-school Whitesnake with the mighty Zep.Strangely enough,Page abstains from soloing,making concessions to the overall structure of the songs,but this doesn't take away anything from the power and majesty of this album.A magical combination indeed."
4,Misunderstood,"Coverdale/Page were a great Duo. David Coverdale is in NO way a Plant Clone. He did great things with Deep Purple and continued all through his carreer. The only complaint people seem to have is that Whitesnake got popular during the horrid ""Hair Band"" time. I have this album and a great Bootleg from Japan that shows the power and ability of this band. If the only real complaint is that Jimmy Page plays guitar like Jimmy Page, get over it!"
4,An Interesting Development,"This CD brings up an interesting point. Led Zeppelin's influence can be quite obviously seen in Coverdale's band Whitesnake, but when he sings with Jimmy Page, it is quite hard to beleive that he is not Robert Plant. The two come from a similiar stylistic background, and they even look the same. After listening to the Led Zeppelin song ""In My Time of Dying"" followed by the Whitesnake song ""Slow and Easy,"" I find it hard to beleive that Plant and Coverdale are truly separate vocalists. Coverdale/Plant sounds to be one more release from Page and Plant, but at a fraction of the cost."
1,One of the worst albums I bought,One of the worst albums I bought. Shake my tree and Pride and Joy are passable - rest are horrible.
2,Down A One-Way Street,"Depending on who you believe, Jimmy Page was either miffed at Robert Plant - which had him seek out one of the better Plant clones, David Coverdale - or the project was slated for a new vocalist and Plant became irritated after that word got out.The final say was from the legion of fans who avoided the release. Tepid sales nixed a scheduled tour and brought Plant and Page back together again for future projects. On one level, it was too bad that the project couldn't stand on its own commercially. But Page was delivering a Led Zeppelin sound without the lead vocalist and people weren't buying into it.Page has never been able to shed the legacy he structured through Led Zeppelin. And it doesn't help when he can't get out of delivering little while grinding through the same territory."
2,The low point of Jimmy Page's illustrious career.,"I can't give this album fewer than two stars, because, hey, Jimmy Page is Jimmy Page. But, unfortunately, David Coverdale is David Coverdale. This unholy alliance was doomed from the start. Unlike Page's fantastic collaboration with the Black Crowes, his album with the derivative Mr. Coverdale was a disaster. This album was released when I was in college, and I had a benighted loser of a roommate who purchased this garbage. I promptly broke his CD in half and left him some small change in the case (which was probably overly generous on my part)."
4,What fun!,"Since we have a farm, and cows, this little story was quite amusing. Now we have to watch our cows constantly, as we have a large creek flowing through our lower fields. Don't want any of 'em to get to the ocean!"
5,Amazing health assistance,"I have purchased and given this book to many people who are experiencing health problems that their doctors seem unable to address. This technique is amazing and has given back optimal health to so many of my family and friends. It is a little in depth at first, but is much easier reading as you continue on."
1,Absolutely no information to use for your Illness,i have bought this book to treat my rhinitis.I was totally disgusted with the book as it is nothing other than advetising about herself.The book is full of testomonials and everywehre you read is about she / he was saved from illness miraculouly.I do not understand the people have given her full credit for the book and i am pretty sure they have either not read the book or even glanced it for a moment.
5,Low sodium mac n' cheese,"This is the lowest sodium mac n'cheese boxed meal I've been able to find. I'm not a huge fan of rice pasta, but if you give the pasta a good rinse in cold water before cooking, it takes alot of the starch away and you end up with a very tasty mac n'cheese from a box that isn't just a load of salt. The white cheddar sauce has a good tang and comes out nice and creamy. If you want a quick meal from a box, without being totally unhealthy, this is something to try."
5,Great for gluten-free eating; my kids love it,"I'm trying to gradually reduce the amount of gluten in my children's diets and a friend whose child eats 100% gluten-free recommended this. My kids love it and I like it because, although it is processed and in a box, it does have a relatively small ingredient list. I mix it with about 1/3 the milk called for and then add about 1/2 -1 cup pureed carrots or sweet potatoes. My kids have no idea that they are getting a veggie and the orange color of the veggies adds a nice orange 'cheesy' color (the cheese inthe mix is white) that makes it look like the Annie's mac n cheese they were accustomed to."
5,love this game,shipped really fast. A little dirty but nothing a little paper towel and water couldn't fix. I love this game
5,Eisner crusader,Excellent book. Talented storytelling. Well balanced mix of chivalry and male comradery. Good use of historical sites.
1,The Crusader,"This is a long, drawn-out episode that goes nowhere. It's very lightweight reading and not very realistic."
2,Dry......,"Well....you know how toast is without butter? Very, very dry. Well that's sort of like this book. I finished it as is my habit, but it was slow going, some historical errors (got to do your homework), and after all that the ending just blew me away. I won't give it away, if you make your way there, but let's say I was on the disappointed side of things. For his credit though, he had a good story idea, really liked some of the characters he just fell a little short of the mark on this one."
5,A treasure in a sea of books,"The Crusader gripped me from the first page. Eisner paints an incredibly vivid picture of a dark period in human history through his story of a 13th century knight, Francisco de Montcada. Eisner takes us on an engrossing journey through violence, war, romance and ultimately redemption. We enter this world through the eyes of a monk named Brother Lucas who has the daunting task of exorcising Francisco's demons. We then go back in time and learn through a sequence of events what brought Francisco, an ordinary man, to the brink of insanity. The character development and pace of the book are both top notch. I could not put it down. I came across this wonderful book by accident and am not usually a fan of historical fiction, but if all authors of this genre could tell a story as masterfully as Eisner then I would branch out more!"
4,Slimy Yet Satisfying,"The Crusader is an excellent book- the characters are very well developed, their motives are human, and it is historically accurate. I enjoyed the internal conflict of Brother Lucas, as well as Isabel's ideas. The battles are extensively described (sometimes very graphically), and the plot is interesting but not too complex. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction as well as someone who is looking for something interesting to read."
4,A moving novel of one crusader's experience...,"I cannot understand why some of the reviewers have been so terribly hard on this book. Is not a novel first a story? In that Mr. Eisner succeeds tremendously in telling a unique and touching story of Francisco and Brother Lucas, Andre & Isabel. I really enjoyed this historical novel, although it is not an epic, and that's OK.The scenes in the prison hole touched me most of all, and the ending was satisfying, not overdone. I highly recommend this novel, not because it's ""historical"", but because it's a lovely story set in an interesting time and place."
2,leaked,"I was having some other work done to my vehicle, the dealership was actually amenable to putting inthe block heater while the coolant was drained.Unfortunately, the center bolt in the block heater would not seal. Time is money, so I let them get a differentunit from their supplier.Apparently, they threw away the 11603 I got from Amazon, so I won't be trying to return it or get a refund.So, I'm out $15, nothing to cry over.The heater came packed fine, it looked brand new, and I have had great success with Kat's products inthe past. Just luck of the draw. I will continue to get Kat's products, and the seller was fine."
2,Dont judge a book by its cover,well it all started when a friend of mine purchased this gun. His gun had 350fps looked nice an was a well rounded gun. So i decided to get me one then it all went down hill. when my gun arrived i notice a major difference mine had 280fps an his had 350. After that we started looking for differences an we also noticed mine had a front weight an his didn't. soon after we checked the boxes an whata u know we had two different guns. We purchased them on the same site the same gun and even computer. so there is no telling which gun you will get. u could get the weak a-15 panther or u might get the evolution. the guns will look exactly the same except one will say evolution and one will say A-15 panther. An yes the sites are always crucked on the front for some reason.
3,"Before you buy this check out new ""Essential Red Collection""","Sammy Hagar's Essential Red Collection will be released on August 10, 2004, so it might be worth your time to look at that compilation before buying this older one. I believe that the ""Essential Red Collection"" even has at least one track from Sammy's days with Montrose (unless it's a live version of ""Bad Motor Scooter"".)One of my beefs with both collections is that ""When the Hammer Falls"" is absent. Although I'm not completely familar with everything Sammy has done, IMHO that is the best track from his ""I Never Said Goodbye"" album. But at least the new collection has ""Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy,"" which is inexplicably missing from ""Unboxed"".3 stars (because the new compilation is more thorough and longer [20 tracks], and this album is missing one of my favorite Sammy-solo tracks ""When the Hammer Falls"" and also ""Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy"" )."
4,THIS IS THE ONE!,"Don't be fooled by the Best of Sammy Hagar. While its good in its own right,it contains his older hits.This one has all of his classic head-bangers! Heavy Metal, 3 Lock Box, Fall in Love Again,... they're all there! In fact the only reason that this isn't a 5 star Cd is because it is missing the early works on his best of.. like Sittin on the Dock of the Bay and I've Done Everything for You! Here's hoping a 3rd greatest hits is in the works which will contain all of these, and new hits like Mas Tequila! I'm so glad he's out of Van Halen!"
5,Sammy Hagar Unboxed,"Sammy Hagar Unboxed is full of great tunes. It collects 10 classic songs from Hagar's years at Geffen records, and adds to new songs High Hopes and Buying My Way into Heaven. All the tracks on Unboxed come from Standing Hampton, Three Lock Box, Voa, and Sammy Hagar a.k.a. I Never Said Goodbye only overlooking HSAS Through the Fire that came out in between VOA and Sammy Hagar. Unboxed contains most of Hagar's hits from 1982-1987. Although Unboxed is a great set, Sammy Hagar deserves much better, and I'm aware of the Essential Red Collection released last year. When are they going to get it right? It's about time they released a double disc set combining his Montrose hits, with his hits on Capitol,Geffen, and MCA Hagar deserves a complation that covers his whole career. This man is a rock n roll icon, over three decades of rock and only a couple of single disc complations for this guy!!"
5,A fun read and a good yearly magickal almanac.,"I really like this yearly almanac, it is an entertaining and informative read with lots of different articles on all sorts of topics related to magick. It also has all the basics for each month, moon cycles, astrological signs, magickal holidays, and more. I personally like Llewellyn's almanac better than the Witches' almanac, due to it's user-friendly format"
5,Better than the Witches Almanac,This is the best magical almanac out there. It is much simpler than the Witches Almanac. It gives the sabbats listings and moon phases.
2,"Fluff, but Fun","Boy....it's hard to approach these books. Almost any Witch can tell you that these books really shouldn't be taken seriously, and that is true. So the best way to describe such fluffy bunny books is ""amusement factor."" Face it, Llewellyn sold out long ago and started putting these Fluffy bunny books out on the market to accomodate the young wannabes, but I will give it this: they are fun to read. They are certainly not helpful, but fun to read. Give it a try if you are looking for a book to read that doesn't take the subject seriously. If you are looking to learn Witchcraft, find a better book."
4,An Overview of the Orthodox Church,"Father Nicozisin starts off with a history of Christianity, laying the foundation for the historical claim of the Orthodox Church. A claim that is true - they are the ""oldest"" church, seeing how everyone else split off from them.After laying the foundation, Father Nicozisin goes to discuss the ""Objections Protestants Make Against Orthodox"" and ""The Bible in the Orthodox Church"" before ending with a selection about ""The One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church."" I must pause for a moment and let you know that while the information is good, Father Nicozisin writing style is pretty terrible... personally, I'm not sure how this pamphlet made it through the editing room!!The one selection I enjoyed the most was about the Bible. Father Nicozisin quickly touches on the major position on interpreting the Bible.A quick read for anyone interested in the Orthodox Church but don't have a lot of time."
5,Such a good follow up,"This is a wonderful follow up in this candle making series.In this go around, as soon as the power goes out, so does a life and Harrison has to find out who the killer is, because it happened on Harrison's property. The thing is that most everyone thinks that this is an accident, so nobody really wants to believe that it was a murder. WIth all of this is going on, Harrison rents out the victim's rental space to the victims wife, and nobody wants her there, and old anger runs deep and resurfaces.Myers has such a nice writing style. Granted, there are not any plot twists, but for some reason, this series doesn't need it. Myers has a way of making the reader ""feel at home"" and when they read this series, it's like seeing old friends that you haven't seen in a while. You can't help but to have such a good time reading this series.If you like cozy mysteries, then you really have to start this series. It's nothing deep, but you'll have a good time reading it."
3,Enjoyable for the most part,"Harmoney is lovely, but many of the songs that were less well known are forgettable. Not unusual for most CDs, unfortunately."
5,Please let me live here.,"First sentence:We are not as modern as we like to think we are.I didn't know museums had competitions, but the MOMA in NY did, in 1941, and this book showcases the winners.Includes chair construction, furniture by Eames, Saarinen, Hatfield, Craig, Nicholson, Maier, more. Lamps by Pfisterer, Weaves by Ehrman, prints by Raymond, bibliography, more. Tons of illustrations.10,500 copies of the book were printed. It has stiff covers, with a paper protective cover over that. 48 pp. Very highly recommended."
4,Better quality than the original,"Quality material, better than the original from the manufacturer. If the assembly line had used this brand in the first place, I might not have had to replace it."
2,Top comes off during use,"I have the salt grinder version of this. It worked well, and I like that I can see the salt in the glass bottom. Nice big top to turn, too. The problem is that it is very easy to press the gigantic release button that pops off the top while turning it. Then all the salt pours out onto the food, like some sort of high school lunch prank I've inadvertently played on myself.This happened to me twice, despite my futile attempts to avoid it. Then I threw it away."
5,one of our favorite children's books!,"When my girls were growing up, this was one of their most favorite books - they never tired of hearing it or reading it themselves when they were able. The story of the puppy trying to find its own identity plus the wonderful illustrations make for delightful reading."
5,Good value quality product,"Compare this product to others out there and it's not even close. Non-GMO, PCB and Mercury free, extremely high potency, clean lime flavor, etc. Subscribe and save is an added bonus."
3,Not for me.,"I've only taken these 2 days now, but have had serious digestional problems. After a quick Google search, it seems the cause is most likely the Flax Oil, which can cause a laxative effect. I really wanted to be able to use this since my other EFA causes fish burps, but it's not for me. And I only took 1 a day to start. I couldn't imagine the outcome if I had taken 3!"
5,Cut down the number of pills I used to take,"Trying to keep up with the favorite supplement du jour has left me with a couple of handfuls of pills every evening. In an effort to reduce this I have been searching for supplements that offer combinations of a couple that I already take. Nature's Way Mega 3/6/9 took me down from 8 pills to 3! They are large, but easy to swallow an have no aftertaste like some other supplements that contain fish oils."
1,waste of money,"I bought it hooked it up lasted an hour. the sound went out. sent it to valor took 4 months to get it back lasted 2 weeks and the sound went out again. tried to send it back but they wanted the recpiet the first tiem i sent it and never got a new one, so they wouldnt take it without it even though they pulled up where they sent me a new replacement that month. so now i have a useless brick. i will never go valor again due to the costumer service"
1,Quality questionable,"I have owned this system for about 6 months and it has already started having issues. The rear camera I hooked up goes in and out and the sound to one of my speakers started doing the same. But, if I tap the front of the unit I can make the sound or the camera go in and out at will. SO, I send back to VALOR since it was under warranty and they have sat on it for 4 weeks and done NOTHING to fix it. VERY POOR quality customer service. So, just keep your fingers crossed you don't have issues with your unit.Just disappointed with a product that fails to perform within the first year of owning it and a company that cares even less about fixing it!!!"
3,Nice Tools...Cheap Case,"Just got the tools, they look nice and I'm sure they will work fine in a pinch; however, the case is too flexible and cheap. It doesn't grip the tools well or hold them well and when I put one of the tools back in place, the form used to grip the tool collaped making it unusable. The case is too soft. AFTER ONE USE ?????????? Pay a bit more I guess."
1,Don't bother.,This document is available as a free pdf. No point in ordering a hard copy unless you're on of THOSE people.
3,Wooden Ship Models,A very thorough book of instruction but lacks a definition of the technical terms used throughout.
3,model ships,There are some mistakes and shortcomings in this book. Generally it is a good book for beginners.
4,Will have you running your children to a good piano teacher,Mr Pudewa is convincing that the impacts of musical training on children starting at very young ages is imperative to their intellectual development. He made me wish I could start over with my grown children and would have started earlier with my grade schoolers. I'm heading my granddaughter to a good pianist as soon as she can reach the keys!
4,"Not as hoped, but the first step","More text is given to newspaper publishing, and disappointingly little to books. Good reads on publishers, and finding the common threads of experience for many of these printer/ publishers. I was hoping for more on book production, and book ownership, but both were not as strong. It is well written, clearly organized, well illustrated. For those interested in these topics, the bibliography is also of interest."
3,bordeaux shirt review,the embrodery was much better than i expected it to be. But i only washed the shirt once and the cuff on the sleeve came unsewed. very disapointed in the quality of the make of shirt.
1,Broken upon receipt,"I ordered this regulator via prime. When I received it, the plastic cap was broken. It looks like may have been returned already. I went to order another but it is no longer available vis prime and will cost over 25% more. This is not normal for amazon."
4,"Basic, but does the job","I have several outdoor appliances that run on propane, and I'm tired of running out of fuel at an inopportune time. With this unit, I simply connect two bottles, and when one empties, it automatically switches to the other. This is much better than simple T connections that might let you run longer, but when you run out, you empty both tanks at once. I tend to use a mix of 40 and 20 pound tanks, using the 20 as the ""emergency supply"" that keeps things running till I get the bigger 40 pound units filled.Works great and is very straightforward to install. Construction quality is fine for the price...mine arrived looking a bit oxidized, but works perfectly.Definitely recommended!"
1,dangerous,I am a propane dealer who has experienced 5 major blowouts on Marshal regulators--have gone as far as beginning to remove every one (over 50) from service. One emptied 200 gallons of propane behind a shopping mall another the same amount in a lumber yard. Can't recommend strongly enough--if you have a regulator made by this bankrupt company--throw it in the garbage.
5,Perfect replacement regulator,"Ordered this regulator to replace my 6 year old leaking one that came with our RV. This part fit right easily in place of the old failed one, and works perfectly. The Marshall unit is much better built than the original auto changeover regulator on our trailer and should last a long time!"
1,Shilling for Globalization,"This book is nothing but yet another call for open borders and globalization. Other than using the tired old Samurai metaphor, the authors provide little in the way of real business examples in Japan. I was wondering how far into the book it would be before they mentioned importing guest workers but sure enough, I occurs on page 93 about 1/2 way through the book. The authors give the example of Shinsei bank and make sure to mention importing workers from India to Shinsei as a sure sign of ""Japan's Renaissance"". Well, I did a little research on Shinsei Bank and since they started this radical new program, the company has gone into the tank including its stock - no doubt ruined by imported guest workers as so many American companies have been. Japan's ""recovery"" is due to nothing more than increased trade with China - China's new consumers want to buy Japanese products. Don't waste your time or money on this book - and don't give these globalist shills any more money."
2,A cynical defense point of view,"Hicko defense the current tax system of USA in a very cynical and rough way. The book takes you through in his myths based on the proposed new flat tax system by Alvin Rabushka, Dick Armey, Robert Hall, Robert Eisner and Herbert Stein. However, you will have moments during reading when you can laugh about his viewpoints of defense. Before you read the book, it might be better being at least a bit familiar with some other books, like: Robert Hall, Alvin Rabushka, The Flat Tax; and/or Dick Armey, The Flat Tax; and/or ISBN 0-8447-3987-1 Fairness and Efficiency in the Flat Tax. Just to mention some. Me personally, I would recommend to read the book of Scott E. Hicko, because it is always good to see opposite viewpoints as well, in order to evaluate more correctly. You do will have fun."
1,Not Even Looking in the Right Place,"For almost 150 years America thrived and expanded without an income tax.Our problem now is that we have an income tax. Scott Hicko is discussing what? Another income tax!The difference between our graduated income tax and a flat income tax is the difference between being tortured to death slowly versus being killed quickly with a shot to the head. I guess I'd take the shot, but I'd rather have a third option of keeping my life and living it freely.You best bet right now is to use Amazon to gather as much about income taxation as you can. I highly recommend ""Your Money Or Your Life"" by Sheldon Richman and ""Why Government Doesn't Work"" by Harry Browne.The enforcement of any income requires that the government pry into you private life. I want to end that, and enter the new millenium as a much more free country."
1,ITEM NEVER DELIVERED,"WHERE IS MY ITEM?I placed an order on 29/11/2010 (for 2-4 days delivery service), and it never delivered up till now. money had been taken from my bank account. am very dissappointed about this service. Please can I have my money back or else I will take a legal action against Amazon.Stella hassan (UK)"
5,Over 50 Years of sparkle,"My Revere pots and pans are over 50 years old. They still look good enough to display, thanks to Revere copper and Stainless-Steel Cleaner. I also have some expensive stainless steel pots, and this cleaner keeps them looking like new too."
3,"People who own Revere Ware are probably not obsessive about their copper cleaner, anyway","The stuff works. It isn't magical, like Calphalon Radiance, but you can just squirt a dab on while washing dishes, wipe and it does the job. I would categorize it as good everyday copper cleaner- if you polish your copper pots after each use- rather than something to reach for to remove a great deal of patina, or to prep something to perfection for display.I don't think it is worth ordering online and having to wait for, though. Grocery store products are just as decent- if you want great stuff get the Radiance or Mauviel Copperbrill."
2,Not good for scratch removal,I bought this product because I read a review from a couple of people that it was able to take scratches from stainless steel appliances. I was not successful in my attempt. I imagine it is good for what it was designed for though.
3,Just Okay,"I have expected my old pans (over 20 years) would shine after using the cleaner; however, water marks remain there. Sometimes I clean the pan while it is boiling. The pan restores shining a little bit."
1,Does NOT remove scratches from stainless steel,"IGNORE whomever posted review(s) because this product does NOR remove ANy scratches from stainless steel. I tried every possible method, direction, pressure and have ZERO affect on frig, microwave oven or other stainless steel counter-top appliances. I would return it for a refund but this merchant won't refund shipping to or from so it would cost me more than what I paid for this order."
1,Didn't live up to its advertisement!,"The Revere 7-Ounce Copper and Stainless-Steel Cleaner did not live up to its advertisement. It states that it will remove scratch marks and clean and polish Stainless-Steel. It does not remove scratches or clean and polish. In fact it is virtually impossible to remove it once it is used as instructed. It does not work on smooth Stainless Steel. It also should and does not state that it is not to be used on Brushed Stainless-Steel. I found that out after about an hours search on the internet for information on the product. I was very disappointed in this product and will not use it again.If you are looking for a product to clean Brushed Stainless Steel appliances and cookware, please do your due diligence before you settle on this. It is just not worth the nearly 2 hours it took attempting to remove it when applied as instructed."
5,Revere 7-oz copper & stainless-steel cleaner,"This is the only product I have found that instantly, with little to no scrubbing, will clean copper back to its original color and shine. It also does a really good job on Stainless-steel."
2,Honestly...,"A bottle of Tarn-X worked so much better and faster.Just use scratch-free sponges for general cleaning, and when the copper gets dingy a damp cloth of Tarn-X worked in about 10 seconds.This cleaner kept my elbows greasy for at least 20 minutes a pot. It DOES work... but be prepared to scrub - at about twice as much as regular copper cleaner works!"
1,Ehhh. Not so Much,Bought it because a review said this was the BEST and AMAZING for stainless steel appliance care. It's NOT. Nothing special. Take a pass. Glad I didn't buy the larger portion for more $.
2,Did not solve issues that were described in ad.,This product while GREAT on your stainless surfaces did not perform on scratches as advertised. I tried 3 and 4 times using different methods (and I am an engineer) with limited results. While my stainless looked very shiny and clean it did not blend the scuffs and scratches.
2,Overcooked Navel-gazing,"I continue to be amazed at the number of people suckered by Jeffrey Thomas' Cley series. In the first book, an excellent concept was destroyed by a convenient plot in the last half of the book and Ford's deus ex machina efforts to reform Cley, a clear monster if I ever saw one. In the Memoranda, Ford creates a story where none exists--we are dreaming inside the head of Cley's former master and meeting folks who don't exist. The detail in the book is abysmal, the style horrible. My favorite authors are Wolfe, Nabokov, Kafka, and Angela Carter, among others. This book is a pale, pale shadow of those authors and should be avoided."
1,Pure ....,"60min dvd..maybe 10-15min of import cars.good music, but very low quality.camera dude is somekind of amateur. picture like ......DON'T BUY THIS.. Any dvd is better than this."
1,Do not buy,"I bought this for my daughter, she is a rural mail carrier.This did not even last the first day. Magnets would not keep it on the roof and light broke the first use.Waste of money....."
4,The folly of war: will Athens listen?,"This play by Euripides is another version of the story of the conflict between the two sons of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polyneices. It has an unusual title in that the Phoenician women are the chorus, observers of the battle between Thebes under Eteocles and the Argive army assembled by Polyneices and his father-in-law, the King of Argos. Once again, Euripides is showing Athens the folly of war."
4,A Factual Book,"I read this book for a report, and I found it very factual and helpful. I don't think it would be the kind of book someone would just pick up and read. I would only read it if I wanted to research or find information on Drunk Driving."
2,Lacks Details,"The subjects covered were helpful, but lacking in detail for one who is looking for expert guidance. I look for an author to get right to the point and explain things as an expert insider would guide the protege'. The author doesn't go much deeper than explaining the obvious, like advising the reader to find out if buyers prefer to review portfolois on CD's, prints, or transparencies. Many points the author makes raise questions rather than providing answers."
3,Good basic stuff although a bit dated,Good overview of what you'll need to do to get started but short on details and the computer-related stuff is outdated in 2002. Legal advice is good and sample form letters are useful.
3,It's Ok but not for the whole body,It looks big enough for the whole body but it feels like it was made for the feet only. It's too harsh for the rest of my body skin. Even after been soaked in water it's not soft enough for my body. It's ok for rough skin and for those that have rough skin on their feet but that's about it.
4,Good loofa!,"This is a good loofa and works as it is supposed to. Can't complain, and wouldn't. Good quality and works fine."
2,Hard like a rock,"I bought this and the one with the longer handle for the back --- i thought it would soften with soap and water --- it remained hard as a rock --- i simply could not use it unless i wanted to scrape my skin off --- i have never used a loofa before and can't believe that people use things that are this hard on their skin... perhaps if you wrapped a hand towel around it you might be able to use it, but by itself you will damage your skin and draw blood..."
1,not worth $...,"the only thing special about this cd-player is how slim it is. The sound quality is ... considering i bought a cheaper 50 dollar cd player with way better bass and sometimes better sound. another thing i didnt like was the the only way you could turn on special features like bass boost was by using the remote. i did like the rechargeable batteries, but if you want to use regular AA batteries you need to attache a bulky peice of plastic onto the back the holds the batteries. an overall good cd player but not worth anywhere near the $... that amazon wants for it."
2,"AWESOME, WHILE IT WORKED","THE CASE IS KRAP, ALL KRAPI HAD TO RETURN MINE TO THE STORE AFTER 3 MONTHSBEWARE, THE CASE CAN'T TAKE MORE THAN 1 OUNCE OF WEIGHT"
3,Underwhelmed.,"Besides getting way too much of Pete Lyons, the rest of the video was fair. Way too much current footage of cars at Laguna Seca, and much of the period footage is poor. A few interesting insights from participants from back in the day."
2,upset,"after using this only 2 weeks, it became rusted and corroded just from every use with putting a soap bar in it. its nice to look at but dont expect to use it and it remain in the same shape"
4,Very nice bag.,"This bag is very nice and well made. Even without my laptop though, it's kind of heavy. It provides very good protection for my computer, but no extra room for peripherals, like a travel printer, which would make it way to heavy to carry anyway!!"
3,"Excellent protection, too much weight","This bag has every pocked I need, and all the protection my laptop needs... but the bag itself weighs more than my computer!Pros:- compartments for all the little things that usually get lost in large bags: phone, keys, cords, pocket knife (or make-up)- superior protection for the computer, bag is very well padded and construction is extremely sturdy for a women's bag- exterior is easy to maintainCons:- weighs about six pounds when empty- no shoulder strap"
2,...,"My review of this book will be very short: It should be titled ""David Miller's Political Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction"". I bought the book expecting to be introduced to political philosophy, but I find that I have learned more about Miller's opinions (however mainstream) than political philosophy itself. It's like trying to learn from a salesman rather than a teacher--you will learn something, but it's still annoying. The caliber of the Very Short Introduction series is generally higher."
3,"narrow, color is different from picture",I ordered Navy and the color was almost indistinguishable from black. The opening is also narrow for 9M - I'm returning this item.
4,Best of Stray Cats,Cheaper way to get the best of the Stray Cats. Great music to swing dance to. They're good live too.
5,DnB mix.,"Good mix. To be honest, the first time I listened to this mix, his brand of DnB blew my mind. Definitely a breath of fresh air from all of the run-of-the-mill techno/house compilations out there. This guy is such an obvious talent that you have to believe he was going to make a mark sooner or later. I would also do a search (google) for his 2007 Essential Mix (voted the Essential Mix of 2007). It's a must listen."
2,pasty consistency,"I was so excited to find a gluten free angel hair that I immediately put in a bulk order. This allowed me to give this product about ten chances with different cooking and rinsing techniques, various sauces and attempts at patience. It's awful. The rest of the boxes will go to the food bank because obviously some consumers like it. I will stick with Schar and a few other faves that get the consistency and flavor right... and just forego the angel hair."
3,Flipper,"I purchased the DVD to have on hand when my nieces & nephews come to our house.People either like or dislike Paul Hogan. I don't always agree with the image Paul portrays of Australian men. (being Australian male myself) The Australian ""Ocker"" image is a false image as far as I'm concerned.The movie is light hearted and entertaining with Hogan's antics.Story line is good- A young American boy's inter-action with a Dolphin while holidaying with his rough Australian Sea CaptainUncle.A good family movie."
5,Swimming with Dolphins,This is a wonderful movie. It's entertaining all the way through. Of course when I finished it I put it on the shelf next to Day of the Dolphin!
4,Flipper,"I grew up with the first 2 Flippers, but liked this one best of all. I suppose it was because of Elijah Wood."
4,Good Movie,My niece saw this movie when she was growin up. She loved it and would role play scenes from the movie every so often. I bought it for her and her mom when she turned 18! She loved seeing something she loved from her much younger years! It brought back good memories for them both!
5,Flipper,Do you remember when Flipper was on TV every week? Enjoy this movie because it brings back happy memories and is a great story.
5,flipper 1996 the movie is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I mean it from my heart when I say i've never seen a more beautiful movie!I love dolphins, and I'm gonna be a dolphin trainer. THIS movie inspired me so much. It's awesome! and there is so many times during this movie I cry! because it's so touching! especially when sandy and flipper becomes friends and swim together for the first time!and when sandy tells him to go back to his family...that is so touching!!!Elijah looks hot aswell:)EVERYTHING IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not for young children,"Showing someone shooting a dolphin (although they don't show the dolphin being shot - but there is blood in the water) is not appropriate for young children. At least in free Willy, the whale is released after being mistreated. However it's hard to explain why someone would shoot a harmless animal to a young child."
4,A Family feel good movie!,I believe this one was overlooked when it came out. The only thing is Uncle Porter (Paul Hogan)has gotta get some other food besides all those cans of Spagetti-O's. If you are a Paul Hogan fan then you will enjoy this film. I am ready to visit Uncle Porter just so i can enjoy the beach and ocean. LOL Good Movie!
4,A Great family film!,"Flipper is a sure 'hit' every time.Ever since the 1963 TV series, and with every incarnation, it continues to attract viewers from age 5 to 70. This 1996 Universal production is no exception. Paul Hogan and Elijah Wood deliver good performances, and Flipper, of course, is the star of the show.This is a family friendly film with good, age appropriate action but the slight profanity makes it slightly crusty. As Sandy and Flipper bond over his Florida Keys summer, their interactions as well as those between Sandy and Uncle Porter are memorable.The Blue ray format makes viewing this film sparkly and inspiring! This particular Blue-ray includes pocketBLU and BD Live turning a single feature into a multi-media experience.A good companion to the new TV series."
5,Flipper Movie,"My 4 year old son loves this movie, he watches it over and over...the hammerhead shark makes him a little nervous, but the dolphins beat up the shark, and he loves that part..."
4,A Good Bargain,"This DICTIONARY-CONCORDANCE seems to be designed for the average lay person who is reading the NEW AMERICAN BIBLE which itself contains numerous footnotes explaining the more difficult verses of the Scriptures. Included in the DICTIONARY-CONCORDANCE are every name in the Bible, descriptions of biblical places, summaries of the books of the Bible and a time chart of Bible history. Modern principles of Scripture study in keeping with the documents of the second Vatican Council are reflected throughout the text. Overall I recommend the book as a useful tool for Bible study although the time chart is definitely a disappointment."
4,New not as good as the old!,"The NEW WORLD DICTIONARY CONCORDANCE to the N.A.B. HAS A TYPOGRAPHICAL FAULT! BETWEEN FACING PAGES THE ""GUTTER"" IS SO NARROW THAT THE PRINT IS PRACTICALLY TOUCHING THE POINT WHERE THE PAGES ARE BOUND. SO IT'S SORT OF A CHALLENGE O READ! (The original edition has the print on facing pages well spaced, so each paragraph and column of type is distinct! Note, however, the material(very valuable!)is all the same in both editions.)Better luck next time!~"
2,Dictionary Concordance to New American Bible,"Was listed as the ""1982 edition""Actually was the 1970 edition, which I already have."
1,A concordance it's not!,This would be a good choice if you are seeking a compact dictionary. I made the mistake of thinking it would be a concordance. It's not. John
3,not what I thought it was,Whoever wrote this book has one big brain but it is not for solving everyday problems maybe if you work for NASA but not for normal people good book that fast but had to return
1,I don't know if it did anything!!,I made this purchase because of Dr Oz again. It supposed to break up the fat while sleeping. And use the cream to help the cellulite.. No good.
1,Terrible Machine,"I bought this machine and used it 3 times before the O-rings broke. Before that I tried to use it on Chicken, pork, flank steak. I ended up hand pounding each time. Bad buy!"
3,others are better,"I tried this because you could not get any more of mrs. leepers and I found that in my opinion, mrs. leepers is a better rice pasta."
1,Home-Audio Recorders Beware!,"Bought these for use in my Phillips 765 cd-r Home Audio Recorder, which will NOT use these disc's, even though the item description says that the disc's were made with home audio recorders in mind. They don't work in my cd-r recorder, they might not work in yours either. Be Careful...."
2,"To Memorex, or not to Memorex....that is the question","Memorex was the first brand CD-R that i used on my Hewlett Packard Burner. I found that about 15 CDs in the 50 pack were defective. At first they sounded fine, but about a week after burning a CD, static glitches would sound off in random places. I would then track back to where the glitch would be and it would be fine....your guess is as good as mine. Im going to try a different brand like Sony or Maxell"
3,"Great Small Pan, but Very Unbalanced-- Tips easily","We've been very happy with this pan except for one problem:I don't know if the handle is too long and heavy or the base is too small, but this pan has trouble balancing and tips over fairly easily."
4,All-Clad's Master Chef 2 cookware review,"All-Clad has done a wonderful job with the finish and overall construction of this line. These pans need to be in a modern art museum becuase they are just beautiful to look at, so much so that you really do not want to get them dirty. I broke these in using a stick of butter on very low heat and the butter melted so evenly across the entire stick! No hot spots at all.The 1 qt size is perfect to clarify butter or to heat a vinagrette. My only complaint on the saucier pan is that I wish the side's were slightly higher to avoid spillage. Overall a great line of cookware."
5,All-Clad MC2 1qt. Saucier Pan,"I'm new to this line of cookware....but won't be for long. This line (MC2,) along with the other items I've purchased, is more than I expected. This little pan is great for a quick heating of sauces. Cleans up so easily & the handle really does stay cool...that's a very nice change of pace. All-Clad has made a really nice change to the original ""Master Chef"" line, just by adding the gleaming stainless steel handles. I'm not a gourmet chef by any means, but I feel like one with this stuff in my kitchen."
4,"Heats very evenly, but has a few design flaws","I use this little pan for melting butter, toasting seeds, making sauces, making one mug of hot chocolate, and reheating meals (since I don't have a microwave). I did accidentally put it through the dishwasher once, however (not recommended by the manufacturer), and the pretty finish is now somewhat dulled.The main pros are:1) Nice, sturdy pan with a thick bottom as well as uniformly thick sides. Heats very evenly with no hot spots.2) Very easy to clean. It's not nonstick but it cleans up beautifully with just soap and water.3) Lovely design.This pan also has a few flaws:1) There is no lip, so pouring is quite messy. (This is a regular annoyance.)2) The handle is heavy, and when the pan is not full it tips easily.3) The sides are somewhat low, as another reviewer mentioned. I think this pan would work better as a 1.5 quart pan.4) Doesn't come with a lid, which is useful when reheating meals."
1,SDMS Training manual,"Folks, this is Hock, the author. I am so sorry that this little crude, course outline is for sale here by someone at such a high price. This near, worthless, bare bones outline will offer you nothing without the new DVDs to actually understand anything! You are much better off looking up my name on the internet ""W. Hock Hochheim"" finding my webpage and seeing the new DVDs and books we have."
5,excellant,"Item was exactly as described, couldn't believe how fast I received the item, was a great price and was just what I needed."
2,Does not fit valve stem tightly,This does not fit tightly on the tire valve stem which lets air leak out thus taking a long time for the pump to pump up the tire.
3,compatibility issues,"I bought a 50 pack of Dynex cd-r's for $5.99. Not a bad price....but. I've recorded some music and it will not play on my 14 year old Sony stereo. I know it's old, but never had a problem using sony's, tdk's, phillips, or hp's? You may want to think about this before buying these."
3,Not Quite What You Think,"Although a decent book to include in your library on folk art, the buyer/reader should be aware that this book is not strictly about folk art in the manner of most visual art books, but more about the folk ""arts"" found in Texas. It includes an interview with John Milkovisch, the creator of the famed Beer Can House in Houston, a segment on Jeff McKissack's Orange Show environment in Houston, and ""articles"" on tattooing, quiltmaking, Low Rider art, cemeteries, and cowboy hats among other traditional craft activities under the rubric of ""folk."" The Milkovisch interview was very enlightening as was the article on the extremely important Orange Show. The book ends with articles on visual artists Johnny Banks, Alice Montemayor, and Eddie Arning. The printing and some reproductions are less than desirable by today's standards, but don't let that put you off as this is overall still a very good resource."
3,Dont Let The Title Fool You,"This film is much better than it looks. Its a film about the exploration of Venus and its really good especially if you factor in when it was made. The scenes with Basil Rathbone at the lunar base are definitely a little hokey and I didnt recognize Faith Dominque (This Island Earth) at first, but the rest of the film is great! The plot is basicly explore Venus and rescue the first team that landed and got into trouble. The explorers have a really neat hover craft that they travel in to save their comrades. There is a tough metal robot that is realistic. Dinosaurs and other nasties try to make a meal of various crew members without success. Its just an all around fun film along the gendre of First Spaceship to Venus. The special effects are innovative and impressive especially considering the time when the film was made. I saw this film when I was a kid and was happy to make its reacquaintance. If you like classic science fiction, you will love this film."
3,The Cormanator Strikes Again!...,"Yes, this is indeed the eastern european sci fi classic in it's Cormanized form, before being totally destroyed in it's final VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF PREHISTORIC WOMEN incarnation. Here we get added scenes of Basil Rathbone as the head of an extremely boring moonbase, and Faith Domergue as Marcia, the communications relay person between the moon and Venus. On Venus itself, we have two sets of astronauts (cosmonauts) looking for each other. One group encounters a man-eating plant (much like the one in Angry Red Planet), a bunch of stuffed dinosaur puppets, and a mysterious singing lady. The others must deal with a horde of lizard-men, the lava from an erupting volcano, and a robot that wants to dump them into the molten flow! Speaking of the robot, it's actually pretty cool looking. It's up there with Robby (Forbidden Planet) and the B9 (TV's Lost In Space)! All in all, VTTPP is a good waste of time on a rainy afternoon..."
3,themeatbpotatoesofitall,"old movie with alot to offer, old style models(hover crafts,rockets, Space men, Dinosaurs, a Robot, giant flying vulture thing with bad hair that moved like it had a hangover, and rubber suit lizard men ( I bet I could have fought them off without a pistol) acting is above average all in all some time was spent in the visual art department, so yeah,. I liked it.. I have a soft spot for these types of movies(always better than watching reality shows)So for a price less than a small bag of popcorn, you too can experience, a cool oldy..Show your kids this stuff because it won't be around in the future,..goofy effects will always bring smiles.. Gets on the B table but no plus + takes a Hit for the effects,. cheesy but alot of fun to watch..(B+ movie ""Mosquito"") expensive and worth it for the collection.."
3,A Nostalgic Review,"This movie is a re-make of a Soviet era film called PLANETA BURG, The Stormy Planet. I had seen that movie in its original presentation as a little boy and this English version comes very, very close to it. Several Earth ships head to the planet Venus and after a lot of misshaps the astronauts land on it and are attacked by the dangerous animals that inhabit it and the lava flows from underground volcanos. They bring with them a very sophisticated robot called John which resembles up to a point Robbie the robot of the other space movie FORBIDDEN PLANET. They also move around in a floating vehicle. After narrowly escaping destruction they leave in a hurry discovering at this very end that its inhabitants are very much like us. The acting is not bad and there are plenty of special effects with a lot of imagination. I liked it mostly because of the way that space adventures were conceived then. I sincerely recomend viewing it."
1,Crappy Sci-Fi,The only reason I bought this DVD was because I remembered seeing it on TV when I was a kid. 'Voyage...' is quite possibly the worst Sci-Fi movie ever made. The only good thing in it is the robot 'John' and he get melted at the end. Too bad it wasn't the actors and director. And don't count on Rathbone to help out - he only appears for maybe 5 minutes total.
3,Only a fan...,Another old movie using the effects of the time that are not the best. One of Basil Rathbones last movies.
3,Bad-Acted Voyage To Venus,"VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTOIC PLANET is a truly interesting sci-fi adventure combining FORBIDDEN PLANET and THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT. Three men come to Venus in search of two men and a robot who previously crashed on the planet. There, they find prehistoric monsters and other ancient items and hear a woman singing(this is explained in the sequel,VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF PREHISTOIC WOMEN). I recommend this film, minus its bad acting and little dinosaur footage.3 stars,1966,Color,100 minutes,Not Rated"
4,"Nice, tall stands.","These are nice stands, Im very happy with them. With that in mind, I thought Id write a review to give a few thoughts. The wire management system could not have been cheaper. They literally found the easiest, cheapest, crapiest way to make it. Its two thin sheets of plastic that are supposed to slide in place but dont. If you get them on, they will probably pop off like mine did. I just took them off and put two small pieces of black duct tape on the back and the wire nor tape is visible. The holes that are pre drilled for the top plate are too fat and once I got the screws in, you could still pull the top right off with ease. I took 2 longer screws and used them, problem solved. I also thought that the base of these would have a little more weight to them. all in all I am happy with this purchase and even though it took a few days to get used to having them, I now love them. They hold the speakers at the perfect height."
5,Great quality for the price,"These are fantastic speaker stands. High quality, sturdy and durable. They were a snap to put together and have been doing their job flawlessly since. Highly recommended."
2,arrived damaged,"These arrived damaged due to poor (lack of) packaging from the manufacturer so I never got to try them out. Both post were damaged on the ends and from what I could tell it was all MDF no real wood to be found. I did get to look them over and the finish looked pretty good and they probably would have been acceptable if it weren't for the poor packaging. Only option was to return them. Do I risk ordering another pair knowing about packaging issue..no so the searched continued.I found these searching onlineDR Pro DRPRO SMS1BK Wood Studio Monitor Stand (Pair) BLACKand picked them up locally at guitar center on sale at 79.99. They are really very nice and very sturdy. They were packed really well like someone cares to get them to you undamaged so I think you could order them online and expect them to arrive in good shape. The top plate is 8"" wide by 9"" deep. I did have to square up the ends of the post a little with a sander so they would sit level."
4,Item Description,"The item description could be better here. This product is the Sanus NF-36B Speaker Stands, and yes, you do get a pair."
4,From the artists view,"An insightful view from the artists themselves. Interesting perspective on galleries, other artists and shared frustrations regarding the community as a whole. Highly recommended for anyone who wants more than an academic or critical opinion of the art scene."
5,"Pure, Southern-Fried REDNECK PUNK!!!","I have to admit: I bought this CD for 50 cents at a garage sale, with no jewel case or liner notes, just the CD. I'd heard ""The Lumberjack"" late one night on my favorite classic rock radio station, as well as ""Down On Me."" Both these songs were good, but ""The Lumbejack"" blew me away, the first time I'd EVER heard a chainsaw solo in my life! And the thing was, it actually sounded GOOD! Anyway, back to the CD in question. The first time I listened to the entire CD was on a road trip, and I loved it from then on. Still do. Jackyl is like a mixture of AC/DC and Guns N Roses, with a lot of Southern flavor mixed in. Basically, as their song proclaims, they are Redneck Punk, pure and simple. And they know how to ROCK! Choice cuts: Just Like A Devil, I Stand Alone, The Lumberjack, Redneck Punk, Brain Drain, and Back Off Brother. If you like good hard rock, buy this CD and rock on!"
5,KILLER!,"Essential CD for any Jackyl fan (personally I have them all). This album ROCKS! I bought it when it came out just for ""The Lumberjack"" and was immediately hooked. When will it rain has become a favorite of mine as well as Dirty little mind, Redneck punk(awesome), Down on me, I stand alone, I could go on about this album for hours(and listen to it for hours). It still gets lots of play time here! Especially when I am home alone and can crank it up. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
2,JACKYL,"CD quality is very poor ... but claimed it was a VERY GOOD ... a lot of scratches, but nothing is written about it was not ..."
5,Jackyl Review,Do I even need to review this item? It's Jackyl! This is america's band & if you don't like them you're unamerican!
4,Jackyl's best album.Redneck rock!!,"The best way to describe Jackyl's sound is that is has the redneck sensibilities of Lynyrd Skynyrd along with the hard rock sounds of AC/DC.Great album all around.The video to""I Stand Alone"" just plain rocks with the flatbed trailer gig in the KMart parking lot.The first half is fantastic.It has all the band's best known hits.I thought ""Dirty Little Mind"" was the best song on here.In 1992,Jackyl was one of just a handful of bands still making this type of rock amongst the grunge rock revolution that was going on.The second half of the album is a bit bland in some spots,but still an album worth owning.A must have for any hard rock/metal collection."
4,one of my all-time favorites,"First time I heard the band, I was searching for I Stand Alone by Disturbed and me not paying attention, ended up with the Jackyl version. Needless to say it BLEW MY MIND. I was hooked. I got my hands on the album and was hooked from every track. Dirty Little Mind, Redneck Punk, Lumberjack, When Will It Rain (my favorite song on the cd), Brain Drain, and Reach For Me are my personal favorites on the album. Overall it's a great buy either way and well worth it esp if you're into hard rock."
5,I caused the depression again with my expense reports and wicked ways,"I was on my way back to Allentown,Pa for work and heard about them playing that night in a local bar (Metropolis)from local rock station in Harrisburg.I think i paid $10 @ the door not being able to save $2 by buying in advance.What do i care about two measly bucks.It went on an expense report anyways and was free.And how awesome it was.I was 10 feet from the band the whole time.The album had'nt been out long and i was totally into it from the get go.Jesse did his whole gig with the chrome chainsaw when they played the lumberjack song.At the end of their set i had two cold yuenglings and handed Jesse one.He shook my hand,emptied it and threw it toward the bar and broke the bottle.I hooked up with some cast off chick after the show and stayed in Harrisburg.(expense report remember).I saw Jackyl a few other times over the years at Bike Rallies and concert halls.I had to pay then though."
4,A LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTER,"Here's a rich and concise biography of Rosa Lewis (1867-1952), a determined and resourceful woman of humble means, who became one of the top chefs de cuisine of her time and the owner of the famous Cavendish Hotel in London. This book carries the reader from the Victorian through the Edwardian Eras and onto the early post-World War II period. It was very entertaining and is full of remembrances from people who knew Rosa, who was quite a character, a woman who knew her own mind and never minced words."
