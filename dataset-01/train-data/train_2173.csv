2,Lackluster,I've read reviews of this elsewhere and I would have to agree;a fairly lackluster performance. I've seen Jorma perform with Hot Tuna a number of times and the performances were high energy to say the least. I'm not sure what was going on with him during this period but he seems a little disinterested . The backing sounds merely adequate.Maybe it was an engineering problem.
2,TOO BAD............,I'M IN MY EARLY 60'S AND HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO JORMA FOR 40 YEARS. TOO BAD THIS DVD HAS SUCH HORRIBLE QUALITY AUDIO. I'M GLAD THAT ROCKPALAST SAW FIT TO RELEASE SOME OF THESE GEMS BUT THEY COULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER ON THE AUDIO. I OWN SOME NICE EQUIPTMENT WITH A 40 BAND GRAPHIC EQAND STILL COULDN'T GET THE SOUND RIGHT. THE COMMANDER CODY RELEASE HAS SOMEWHAT BETTER AUDIO BUT IT STILL TOOK SOME WORK TO MAKE IT LISTENABLE. SOME OF THE BOOTS FLOATING AROUND OF THESE SHOWS ARE ACTUALLY BETTER IN QUALITY.........
4,Einsteins Masterpiece,"Relativity has been around since 1915, so there has been a lot said in almost a century. Each chapter builds up to doing the Einstein field equations and I had my old Maple math program from the 90's on 3.5 disks and wrote the code to do some Schwarzschild radius formulas of a black hole calculations(I still have a working 486 with a 3.5). In the end, it was a lot of work and fun and upgraded to Maple 10 and gave me a feeling of working over in France at CERN. Again, with a little thought of the presentation, I would have gave the book a five star."
2,No Royal Road,"As a holder two degrees in Physics(BS and MS)a word of caution to any layperson who is tempted to buy this book, thinking it will offer a royal road to easily understanding Einstein's Relativity;it won't. Some books are written to teach; this book was written to impress others - in my opinion."
2,NOT SURE EXACTLY WHO THIS IS FOR,"but the idea appealed to me so I bought it. The author (not a philosopher) went to Ireland and essentially followed Wittgenstein's (50 year old)footsteps while there. He took a lot of pictures to help you see the views that Wittgenstein saw but most of his biographical information comes from Monks DUTY OF GENIUS and Rhees RECOLLECTIONS OF WITTGENSTEIN. He comes across a few people who remember the strange English philosopher but no stories that make this worth its price. An insane Wittgenstein completist like myself probably couldn't resist buying this, but perhaps you should."
3,If you CAN read it's a good book...,"Whilst not perfect (an it is a bit wordy), this is a good overview of a difficult topic which is too often overlooked by other books. It isn't as trendy as XP (which this book mentions in passing) or future-perfect at AOP but the use of UML with a robust process for developing applications such as that espoused by this book will keep you out of a whole lot of trouble. Where this book goes wrong, in my opinion, is the overcomplication in the terminology used. The processes described are fairly simple in themselves - it's just the way they're explained which isn't. In short, a good technical editor would've helped this book immensely. If you're interested in a simpler (but less process oriented solution), try Enterprise Java with UML by CT Arrington which is, so far the best book on this subject."
3,Covers none of the topics in detail,"This book is more of an overview on design. It doesn't cover design patters (except some passing references) and processes (XP and RUP are covered briefly in an appendix). It's more of a best practices book, but how many are you going to remember when you actually get down to design and coding? Patters, on the other hand, are more concrete.UML is covered well, and all discussions are accompanied by UML diagrams.You can read this book before you move on to heavy duty books on design and patterns. There is nothing Java specific here, except sample code, so you can read this even if you don't use Java."
2,Good games -- if you can play them,"This product has some worthwhile educational games. But they must be launched from the disk. Some of the games launch, while others do not (I have a machine running Vista running program compatibility with Win95). Many of these titles are shareware/freeware types, so have even more limited playability."
5,Great,This map folio is awsome. It really helps for towns and in town adventures. I recomend it to everyone who plays site based adventures. That other guy who gave it one star doesn't know what he is talking about because this map folio is great.
3,"Fans should buy, otherwise save your money","I will not reveiw the movie itself because everybody has different taste. If you are reading this review you probably like the movie anyway and know what it is about.The DVD version of this release would be for fans looking to expand thier DVD collection or those who do not have these titles on VHS or laserdisk. If you have it on another format these DVD releases don't have much to entice you.The film is of good quality, but nothing spectacular."
3,Good at first but need more support,"I initially loved the way these felt the minute I put them on and they didn't need any breaking in. However, they do run a half size small. The down side for me however, was after a very long day on my feet, my feet ached and it didn't take but a couple of hours for that to start. I am going to try adding arch supports to see if that helps because the shoe feels nice in other ways like the heel feels like a shock absorber, so I am perplexed as to why they weren't more comfortable."
2,Cute but not so comfy...,"Because of my back problems, I wanted to buy a pair of Merrell's. I heard that they provide lots of support and are very comfortable. While I really like the way these shoes look, the slight heel on them makes my back ache after wearing them for a few hours. If you're looking for something super comfortable, you may want to choose one of Merrell's flat options instead."
3,"Great at first, but they stretch",When I first got this show I was amazed at how well it fit and how comfortable it was. It didn't take long for the show to stretch out - it flies off my feet while walking all the time. I can't make it through the day anymore without getting sore feet. Big disappointment. Maybe I just got a bad batch...
5,I love this book!,"Quotable Women is great. I have owned a copy for 5 years or so, and I still love to glance through the quotes. There is wisdom and comedy in there for everyone. Trust me, any woman would HAVE to love this mini!"
2,Waste of money & disappointing.,We bought this item for our son's 7th birthday from Wal-Mart. The first one had a broken web blaster so we took it back and exchanged it for another. With this one the can of web is messed up I guess because nothing comes out. Also the dart shooter is quirky and doesn't fire each time the trigger is pulled. Sometimes the trigger has to be pulled many times before it will start firing. So now it just sits in the pile of toys and doesn't get played with. My son also prefers the pull over mask that came with his new black spider-man costume than this face mask type. But that is probably just his preference and not necessarily how other boys might feel.
2,Filthy and Dented,It was okay for what I wanted but it was shipped in a plastic bag and came to me filthy and dented
4,Good start for embedded linux world,"This was the only book available on embeeded linux in the market. Linux is making roads in embedded systems. But there is very little information available on the subject. This book gives a basic foundation for system engineers who wants to use linux in their embedded projects. The books explains why linux is more pertinent for embedded projects; the advantages/disadvantages of using linux in embedded systems; how to build a smalles possible linux system; choosing the right hardware for embedded linux; Embedded linux tool kits available in the market; how to boot embedded linux from flash memory; Debugging embedding linux. There is a chapter on the success stories of embedded linux (TIVO, Axis Network camera). Embedded linux resources are given in an appendix. The coverage is not exhaustive but presentation of the material is good; John has done a good job."
1,Useless for both junior and senior Embedded developer,"Do NOT take this poor-descriptive book from bookshelf! Do NOT be cheated by the name of this book, it's my only comment!"
3,"Not bad, but...","Because of my job, I wanted to know more and was recommended this book. I've had it for a year and I still haven't finished the entire thing. I'm 95% done. The beginning of the book is fairly good and summarizes embedded linux. The rest of it, with examples it pretty indepth.. or atleast I thought. Reading about the GPL had some interesting points but I found that you can find all this information summarized better on the net."
1,not that good,"Upon receiving "" Crutch Mate "" I found ample side gel padding but an insufficient amount of padding at the top . I could feel my own padded crutch top through their thin gel top surface . Could be better re-designed . Read this company's fine print before any purchase as they try not to let you return "" health "" products . They keep a percentage of your purchase price if you do make a return ."
3,Overall a disappointment,"I found the first half of the book dull. I mean DULL!! Rudolf Serkin has been my favorite pianist since I was 18 years old and I would have expected some of the passion of his playing to leak into the writing about his life, although he didn't live life in as intense a way as his playing would suggest. The second half of the book gained somewhat in interest but I expected more, especially considering the subject. I think the authors did an acceptable job but there were times while I was reading that I thought I was going to fall asleep because the writing was so monochromatic. I expected more."
4,fun game for the family,This is a fun game for the family. Take a little to learn but fun once you do. This item shipped quick. I wished it was a little less expensive but glad I bought it.
3,Pay attention to the size you are ordering!,I searched for a particular size and this item came up. I didn't read carefully enough to see that it was actually a size I couldn't use. You'd better double check the description well to ensure you don't order the wrong size.
3,Happy with products but entire order is STILL not processed!,I usually have a good experience with this seller but in this particular order have been waiting still for one of the products which has not arrived. I have contacted the seller but have been given no real reason for the delay which is aggravating. I hope the rest of the order is processes as soon as possible!!!!
1,I shouldn't even waste my time writing the review.,"With Cisco Press titles, you generally take a 50/50 chance on getting something worth your time and $$. This book is a big waste of both.I have a-lot of respect for anyone who can stick with writing a book, and getting it published. I have less for this one, since a good portion of it is strait out of CCO, and the bits and pieces that are original, are plagued with errors. I hope whoever reviewed this book at least caught all of the spelling errors, because they missed every technical issue that could be missed.I will say that from a blueprint perspective, this book lays out all of the topics for study. Unfortunatly you'll have to go to other sources to get anything useful on the topics.I recommend you hit the ""back"" button on your browser and search for some books that are really going to help you. Doyle, Clark, Halabi, Perlman, etc."
2,"Win - loose. Cisco Press wins, you loose on this title.","This is simple, this book seems to follow the CCNP 2 track of exam preparation information, which would be good material for the CCIE written, except, according to my understanding, they have upgraded there exam outline and created a new version of the CCIE written test.I like Cisco Press Titles, but I have seen Cisco Press behind like this before. That's why I take the time to read these book reviews and look at the test material before spending any denero on exam guides. It's been worth the hour of research to save seventy dollars on less useful info. My conclusion - I won't be buying this book."
1,Not a good resource for the test,I am really surprised that this book is even passed off as a resouce to use by Cisco to pass the test. It touches on alot of things but only at a surface level. If you do pass the written it will not be because you read this book. Take my advice and the advice of others: save your money and spend it on the book by Rob Payne et al.This is somewhat of a shock and disappointment because I used Bruno's CCDA book to prepare for that test and it was an excellent resource.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,"This book is awful. It in no way is an Exam Certification Guide. This book should not be used to study for the CCIE written exam. Instead I would HIGHLY recommend you buy Sybex CCIE Study Guide by Rob Payne. It explains things in much more detail and is alot easier to follow. I would in no way recommend anyone buy this book. Way too pricey for what little, and I emphasis, little content there is.."
2,Great Book for 2001...,"I passed my CCIE practical in 2001. Had to re-up this year, so I bought Mr. Bruno's book to prepare. The book referenced the new R&S qualification exam by number (350-001), but the content was for the exam I took two years ago! The written has changed quite a bit. This book is useful for about 50% of the subject matter..."
1,"New Test, ---- Old & Error Ridden Book","New Material in the CCIE Test is not covered by this book. The Book stresses the old test materials. Furthermore, I found multiple places where erroneous information will mislead you and if you accept the facts as written, will lead to a failing score. Best example is the coverage of multicast. The book explains the reports versus querys completly backwards."
2,This book is not enough for passing the exam,I strongly recommend not to read this book. For passing CCIE is necessary to read more than it. Some of my colleages study from it and failed the exam. The book don't cover the topic deep enough as requiered.
2,Not good enough.....,"If anyone out there thinks they can buy this book and expect to pass, think again. The NEW(august 7) ccie exam is MUCH MUCH harder than the previous exam and goes into much greater depth. This book is good for a ccnp, definitely not good for a CCIE. The stuff here is just rewritten stuff from the CCO. Save yourself some money and use the CCO links instead.There are good quality cisco press books out there to prepare for CCIE, this sadly isn't one of them."
4,A good CCIE book but ...,"This is not a beginner's book because it assumes some prior knowlege. Having done CCNP, CCDP and read other CCIE books, I discovered that the information in this book is very condensed and there's not enough information on some interesting topics. It should not to be confused as a study guide but a book to be read with other books.I am not sure if there are two versions of this book or whether it has been revised. I ordered my copy from the US Amazon.com (750 page version) but I have seen UK bookshops (including Amazon.co.uk) advertising a 1008-page version which is available from 31 August 2002. It would be interesting to compare the two versions."
3,Good introduction,"This book should not be relied upon soley as a study guide for the CCIE written test...I wish I had heeded the warning the author makes in his initial chapter which highlights this fact. Having said that, this book would be more suited to those taking the routing component of the CCNA/CCNP. Make sure you follow the references the author highlights at the end of each chapter as well as studying the guides at CCO. The main study for the CCIE written should be CCO, RFC's, Doyle's two volumes on routing TCP/IP and Kennedy-Clarke's volume on LAN Switching. My advice is that after you've digested these volumes/sources - read them until the subject matter of the CCIE Written blueprint becomes second nature."
2,Incomplete Material,"I bought this book in hopes of having an all in one resource for the CCIE written exam. This book barely touches the surface of some very important concepts for the CCIE written exam and is not enough for any real world task.Another issue I have, is the author uses all the acronyms, but doesn't write them out. I have a great deal of experience in working with many of these technologies, so it's not such a big deal for me, but others may find this frustrating.The CCNP level books (Routing, Switching) cover the technologies in much greater detail. The exam certification guide is extremely weak, and maybe good for a quick refresher prior to takeing the exam, or perhaps recertifying. Otherwise, I'd look for better material."
1,Exam List of Topics........NOT Exam Guide,"This book listed the exam topics and provide a 30,000 ft look at each. However, this book is worthless for an Exam Guide. Use the Cisco Blueprint at their their web site."
5,GET THIS BOOK! Even for other exams! CCDP. CCNP,"I wish I had bot this when it first came out a month+ ago. Now I find I need it immediately, because it actually covers lots of the material needed for the CCDP exam. Yes, it's HEAVY on technical details, but even if you don't memorize everything, enough may stick in your mind to help you guess the correct answer to the many obscure & tricks Cisco test questions.And yes, it covers a few suddenly now-obsolete topics, but you can easily SKIP those FEW pages (you did read the Cisco exam objectives, I hope!). And it provides uniquely appropriate coverage of the newly-added topics: IS-IS, a little security.(It ""adaquately"" covers PIX config in 2 pages!) IF you go beyond CCNA, get this now (30% off), before (like me) you wish you had."
1,Is this in line with the new CCIE Exam blueprint,"What I want to know from some authority, perhaps Mr. Brunohimself,that whether this book is outdated or does it coverthe new exam. I think the author owes this, and so does other readers who are adamant in being protective of this issue.We need a word of authority to decide this for good..........."
1,Official Preparation for Failing the CCIE Qualification Exam,"I'm really dissappointed with this so called official preparation guide for ccie routing and switching qualification (CCIE QE) exam. It's true that to become a CCIE, sitting down and reading a prep. book is not enough; this is what makes CCIE certification different than others. But a book announced as the official prep. guide, should have given more than an a poor overview of each topic. For those people who are preparing for the exam, I suggest the URLs on Cisco's web site, the TAC documents, which are invaluable, richer in content and most upto date in addition to books already wellknown an mentioned in previous reviews; but not this book."
1,Way Under Expectation,"Hi,I'm a CCNP and CCDA and I've always used CiscoPress Certifications books to prepare my exams.I bought this book hoping that, as the others, it would give me all the elements to pass the test. Oh...if I was wrong.Soon after starting reading it I realized that this book wasn't teaching anything. Each topic was just mentioned and not really unfold as the exam requires.I wasted a week reading it and...you know what? At the end I studied on my CCNP books, integrating what was missing with documents on Cisco CCO. I passed the written test this morning at the first try.Don't waste you money on this. Please"
3,Good game - but rent!,"This is a good expansion for Samurai Warriors. But that's the point.. it's an expansion. You can play as four new characters and enjoy their story mode. You can also use the old characters in Free Mode, but you play in the same stages the new characters are in. The expansion is a lot of fun, but I suggest renting it, since it is too short. There are only a few new things. I suggest you first visit Koei.com and go to the official site for XL, before purchasing. Overall, I would rate the game 3."
2,Koei has lost it!,"This is a rip! It is almost exactly the same thing as the original Samurai Wariors, with a few minor improvements and the playability of Honda Tadakatsu, Ina, Imagawa Yoshimoto, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. When I beat the original Samurai Warriors, I waited anxiously for the extreme legends version. When I played it, I was gravely disappointed. The only pleasable feature was the archives mode which I could use to look at the history after playing the game. There is little this has that the original Samurai Warriors does not. Koei has continually made strategy and action games, each more and more like the last about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms period in China and now action games about the post-Ashikaga shogunite period in Japan. Koei has been milking the same cow for too long! I suggest you only buy this game if you are a fanatic about the Dynasty Warriors series and/or if you do not have the original Samurai Warriors and have a burning desire to purchase this."
2,Be Carefull,"The picture in the description is NOT the item being sold. This one is the tiny 1 pint sized feeder without a center chain holder, and the stated diameter is that of the seed catcher at the bottom - not the feeding tube. I seriously doubt more than one bird could fit on this feeder at a time.Don't get snookered like I did."
3,Confusing,"I bought this product because I had heard many good comments about it both from friends and online. I have used it every day, and haven't really been able to tell a difference. Maybe I don't know how to use it? Not too long after I purchased it, the button on the bottom got punched in somehow, but then I dropped it later and it came back out. It also cracked pretty easily. I'm not sure if it is doing what it's supposed to or not, but I will find out soon if I am pregnant (no thanks to this thing)."
1,Does not work as advertised,This product has yet to yeild any possitive results. The company has poor online support for its product. Don't waste your money - the internet works better.
4,Pure joy to listen to ...,"This is an exceptional group of young musicians. Add this to your collection of jazz favorites. Label it ""Chicago's best and brightest"" or ""Ian Torres' Hot Trumpet."" LaMonte Heflick, [...]"
3,Vibrators for Sale!,"This book does an excellent job of explaining everything you ever wanted to know about vibrators but that begs the question: How much do you really need to know? If you are smart enough to bake brownies, you can navigate ""Sex Toys 101"" without a tutor. Perhaps the detailed explanations would help the completely clueless torn between battery vs. plug-in or front-door vs. back-door but this book is really a cloaked vibrator advertisement so here's a hint: Good Vibrations' beautiful catalog and excellent web site fully explain most of the practical information in this book. Bonus: both are free!"
4,"""Sirens of Titan"" meets ""Stand on Zanzibar""","Ruff's sensibilites go a lot farther back than Snowcrash. This book resembles nothing so much as John Brunner's Stand on Zanzibar, if it had been written by Kurt Vonnegut. It has been a long time since I read a book that was laugh out loud funny, but this book is."
4,"Bill Gates, Ayn Rand, and Earth First! bring you the future.","A good romp and an excellent read. Reminds us of Neal Stephenson's early eco-thriller, ""Zodiac."" The near future brings some clever turns of fate and phrase, though the endless rehash of Ayn Rand's Objectivism midway through bogs one down."
4,"Goofy, Wonderful Read","What a strange and marvelous book. It does have some slow spots, and the ending unravels a little too quickly after a certain detail is revealed about a murder ... but all in all a satifyingromp through a very cartoon-like world. Ruff's satirical poke at Rand is wonderful - this book is an essential read for any Objectivist who takes themselves too seriously. (I feel qualified to make this statement, as I am an objectivist).My only complaint about thebook has to do with its closure - certain characters' fates are left vague, or worse, outright ignored. Matt - if you're reading this - what about Seraphina & 29 Words? Philo? And Kite and Joan?Feel free to rant back at me..."
4,"Good, but not his best.","A humorous and entertaining story that captures ones attnetion and continues to engage until the last page. I was turned on to Ruff's books with Fool on the Hill which I enjoyed so much I had to buy this one. This story provides great charcter development, and tells a story that is unbelievable, yet makes one wonder how far away from reality it really is. A wonderful tale of adventure, comedy, and fighting for fairness, the environment, and big business."
3,Interesting read but not too challenging intellectually,"Either ""Atlas Shrugged"" or Neal Stephenson's ""Zodiac"" will have you thinking deeper - about capitalism and about pollution, respectively. But this is a shorter, more frivolously entertaining read than Ayn Rand's tome, which commends it as a piece of entertainment for any scifi/action novel readers who enjoy thinking about Objectivism in a new context. If you are really after this book for the sewage and the action though, read ""Zodiac"" instead: the chemistry in that riproaring stunt action novel makes more sense and it will leave you thinking about the issues for longer after you put the book down."
4,Ayn Rand lamp interesting,"Not quite as good as his first book. I really enjoyed the Ayn Rand lamp very much. Also, Dufrense is a great character."
4,Creative and absurd and a bit confusing,"Sewer personnel patrol the sewers for mutant wildlife. The boy scouts engage in ""urban scouting"". Computers and robots run amok, - nanoviruses, eco terrorism and a virtual Ayn Rand are all mixed into a zany / absurd vision of New York City of the future.It's funny in parts, - but generally more absurd than funny. The plot starts a bit slowly and is a little confusing in the first half of the book. But the 2nd half really draws the reader in and the plot ultimately is very imaginative.Some of the characters and plotlines could have been developed better, but overall this book is well worth reading if quasi-intellectual sci-fi appeals to you.I'll definitely read other books by Matt Ruff."
5,Richard Condon meets Kurt Vonnegut,"At the risk of expressing a monority opinion, I laughed out loud a lot of times reading this novel--one of the funniest things I've ever read. It's dense plot-wise, a la Condon, with characters reminiscent of his earlier stuff. But it's also torque-y a la Vonnegut. Somehow, Ruff ""sees"" people at their most primitive levels and describes them to a tee.Situations arise that I'd love to have been able to think up myself. No wait a minute--I ~did~ while I was in college. *That's* why I liked this so much! Ah--understanding from writing reviews. I knew they were useful for something."
2,Goofy Entertainment,"Recipe: Start with parody, stir in madcap; search the surreal cupboard, add everything plus the kitchen sink; light on the spices, you don't want much depth; toss sloppily.Result: An entertaining beach read with several tasty morsels (e.g. Abbie Hoffman trying to develop Ayn Rand's sense of humor), but you'll be hungry for some literary meat after an hour."
4,It's Not Rocket Science.,"When you have glowing reviews by 2 great writers on the cover of your dust jacket one expects great things. Well, this book isn't great, but it is a very fun and fantastical read. Anyone who can create a plot that involves Ayn Rand and a mutant shark named Meisterbrau, just to name a few of this book's creations, deserves some kind of credit. Halfway through the book I even started reading Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged."" (And they say TV & movies make people do strange things.) The plot definitely displays the author's ingenuity but I thought it could be tightened up in a few places. The work as a whole reminds me of Pynchon, which brings up the interesting coincidence between Pynchon's review appearing on the book and the fact that Melanie Jackson (Pynchon's wife) is Ruff's agent."
3,A Major Disappointment,"The on-line comments, including endorsements from Stephenson and Pynchon, raised my expectations through the roof. What I found was a disjointed plot with characters who were completely unloveable. I didn't care what happened to them, and I didn't care why. Ruff has potential, but this one left me cold"
2,"Creatively written, poorly edited","I enjoyed ""Fool on the Hill"" a decade ago and have been checking for a second novel off and on ever since. Unfortunately, the wit and innovativeness of Ruff's first novel have taken a cynical turn in ""Sewer, Gas & Electric"".My biggest disappointment was the book's lack of balance, and for that I hold the editor responsible. The Ayn Rand element is vital, but way, way overplayed. There are also strange little allusions left dangling (e.g. one of our hero's contracting chicken pox in the last pages). A serious pruning - to two-thirds of its final length - would have made a much better book."
1,it felt so good to throw it away.,"i'd made it about one third of the way through this meandering exercise in eco-drivel when the pages of the paperback started peeling themselves out of the binding. very cool, thought i, the book is recycling itself; thoughtfully, the pages falling to the floor hadn't yet been read, saving me further aggravation. it turns out you can trust a cover to judge a book-in this case self destruction was the only honorable way out."
2,"bad, bad, bad","I rarely sumbit reviews, but I couldn't leave this dog with raves when I found its self-conscious silliness an embarassment that left me cold. This fella Ruff sounds like an adolescent with lots of energy to spare: like the giggling high school girls that titter nervously everytime the movie they're watching refers to anything they know about- like, PepsiCola, for example. Duh.I doubt the author will make a career of this hobby."
1,Getting people to laugh at Ayn Rand requires no skill.,"It's like shooting fish in a barrel.With a Kalashnikov.More than once.Think about it. How many of these Amazon[.com] reviewers, in the limited time and space available to tell the world what they thought of this book, chose to highlight the fact that it makes fun of Ayn Rand? If this book was so great, or so funny, you'd think they'd have found something *original* to say about it. Oh, wanting the book to be original...must have been reading too much Ayn Rand, ha ha.Go back a few years, to _The Fountainhead_, and read Ellsworth Toohey's views on humor.I didn't think the book was funny."
5,Wonderful game!,"I love this version! I am a mahjongg junkie and have a few different mahjongg games (from E-games and Activision). This one by far is the best. The tiles are arranged full-screen, so they are very easy to read. There are many styles to choose from, even the tile sides can be selected. The background scenes are beautiful and the music is entertaining. My only criticism is that I wish there was a pause game selection. Other than that, this is a very addictive game and lots of fun to play."
1,It did not work on my windows 7,I had this game on my older computer (windows explorer) and loved it so I decided to purchase it when I got my new laptop. It does not work on Windows 7. I was very disappointed because It was my favorite game ever.
5,modern and bright,"I bought this fixture for over my kitchen table.It is modern looking, simple, bright and reasonable. This fixture was just what I was looking for a white and modern kitchen.Thank you again amazon."
1,Broken Glass,"The chandelier arrived on time, but one of the glass shades arrived broken. Had to go to the Home Depot to purchase five matching replacement shades, which made the chandelier a very expensive purchase. Shame on this vendor!"
3,WESTERN LEGENDS,"This 1931 black and white photoplay starring Hoot Gibson was worth watching, if for no other reason than it is a film not too far removed from the silent era. Also, it is probably one my parents saw.It concerns a brother who arrives to solve the murder of his banker brother, while all the time seeming not to be interested, to a point of seeming timid and cowardly to those who have earlier known him. In his quest he is joined by a person named Juan who also is considered unworthy by those that murdered his brother.As a masked, unknown-""El Capitan"", an alter ego, brings terror to the gang and leader responsible. He is eventually able to have the community at large to reveal this man as a killer and himself not a weakling and coward.From an era when white hats triumphed over black hats. Good over evil. Good for 61 minutes of viewing.Let-r-roll, pardners!"
2,Lots of bad ideas,"After reading a lot of these activities, I realized that I wouldn't use any of them with my Pre-Schooler. I am academically oriented, and most of these ideas were just a waste of time and resources - pulling kleenex out of a box and flinging them through the air! What a waste of tissues! Not to mention the mess.After I realized this book was filled with one foolish idea after another, I looked at where these ideas were coming from... Check out the list of states with the worst school systems in the country, and they all figure prominently in this book! Surely there are better books how to spend time with a three-year old without stunting his or her academic interest before he or she hits kindergarten!"
4,Preschool Teacher,"This book is great - just like the others, but not as many ideas for my 3-5 year old students. The other one's seem to offer more ideas."
4,More than just a collection of cute patterns,"This book is a must for artists, mathematicians, philosophers and anyone else interested in the foundations and rationale of Islamic art.This book provides a comprehensive insight into Islamic Patterns in a clear and concise way. I have used this book on a number of occasions when I have needed inspiration for drawings, paintings and even for works of management strategy - curiously enough. It has a wonderful way of both focusing and relaxing the mind that seems to encourage channeled creativity.regards,martyn_jones@iniciativas.com"
2,"Unreadable Prose, Helpful Drawings","The book is well-nigh unreadable. Page after page of impenetrable prose in dense, closely spaced paragraphs, describing complex geometric figures. It is also unsourced: one cannot determine the basis for the author's cosmological, religious and geometric speculations. However, the drawings -- and there are many -- are worth the price. Very helpful to the artist or designer who wishes to understand and incorporate Islamic patterns."
5,Wonderful Tonight is Wonderful,This is one of the best CD's out there - have placed an order for 2 more - one for my parent's & and extra one to give as a gift to some lucky person in the future. Brian's other CD's are very nice also - but this one is EXCELLENT.
5,Nightwalker-eternal darkness,"The movie Nightwalker-eternal darkness is definitly one of the best movies I have ever seen.The animation is cute,the music is excellent and the script is extremely well put together.Each scene is another mystery unlocked.The most exciting bit is when you find out about Shiro's past and the dark secret he holds(very shocking).I found myself completely mesmerized by the storyline,I have now seen this movie 4 times because it was so good.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone,I would think of it to appeal to people of all ages.A wonderful movie."
4,More vampires...,"This disc contains episodes 7 to 12. This continues the tale of a vampire detective Shido as he fights crime and keeps his newest child of the night out of trouble. Like the first DVD it has tons of extras. And like the first episodes there is violence and nudity so this is not for kids. So if you enjoy evil witches, kind-of-evil angels and other horrors that go bump in the night THIS is the anime for you."
2,A rather poor tool,"First the good stuff:- this is pretty solid, and seems made of stainless steel. So no problem with paints of other contamination of the food.- that's pretty easy to use and to wash.The main problem:- there's so much juice left in the lemons and limes after using this that this is a real waste. (and yes, I'm using it in proper way, also do some cuts in the skin so it can 'unroll' well).I'm back to use a manual juicer I have that is made of glass. No contamination, sharp edges to scrape the lemons and limes fully... and easy to wash.This will be good for you if you care about speed and not about extracting most of the juice of the lime and lemons."
4,George Orwell's opinion,"George Orwell also recommends this book. In a letter dated August 1, 1937, still energized and deeply emotionally involved in the situation after his stint in the POUM militia, he wrote -""...I was lucky enough to get out of Spain, but many of my friends and acquaintances are still in jail and I am afraid there is the greatest fear that some of them will be shot, not for any definite offence but for opposition to the Communist Party. If you want to keep in touch with Spanish affairs, the only paper you can more or less rely on [to] tell the truth is the New Leader. Or if you come across it read an excellent book that appeared recently called 'The Spanish Cockpit' by Franz Borkenau."""
2,Recommendation via Orwell,"This was a rather dated, ponderous read. Better read if you come to it with a firm understanding of names, locale, and the players."
4,"Nice, but some flaws","Nice display. Long battery life. Removable battery. However, only plays Divx .avi video files. A real shame it cant play mpeg1 & 2 also. You have to use included programs, and find-download divx codes yourself, to be able to convert mpeg to divx. Not a deal breaker, but certainly a hassel.My biggest gripe, the unit has no stand. You either have to pay more to order a case/stand, or hold it in you hand to view. Why Archos couldnt add a 50 cent plastic fold-out stand to the back is a mystery. I made due by taking some carboard, bending it into a ""V"" shape, and taping it to the back as a stand.With that said, its a nice gadget. Battery life gives at least 4 hours of video playback. Not bad!"
3,"Very cool device, but does not support Windows Media","I just got this yesterday so I haven't had a whole lot of time with it, but so far have not had any technical problems with the device, everything seems to record, play, and sound like advertised and consistent with the positive reviews here.The only issue I have, and it's a big one, is that it doesn't support the Windows Media format. All of my home movies (Moviemaker, photostory, etc.) and CD-ripped songs are in wmv or wma format. That's what came with my computer, so that's what I use. In order to get them to work on the Archos I will have to encode them to avi or mp3, which is an extra step I'd rather not take.In fairness, as of this writing, there is no other portable video *recorder* out there that supports the WM codec (I've searched everywhere), so this is as good as it gets until the flagship WMA video players (Creative, Yepp, RCA, iRiver, etc.) have video recording capability."
3,Hope nothing goes wrong!!!,"I gave this three stars because it is a great device, but cross your fingers if something goes wrong. Hopefully you will not have to deal with their customer service. They give customer service a whole new meaning."
3,Short Battery Life,"I saw 13 hours listed in the description at the company's web site. Don't believe it. Mine works really well as long as it's plugged up. It will run for about one hour on batteries, less if I'm doing any video. Needless to say, it was next to useless when I went traveling."
4,Archos Av420,"I think that this is a very good device. It preforms great at all of its advertized functions. Its screen is amazing. at 3.5 inches you and up to two other people can watch at the same time. At the moment i have 20 hours of video on it and 4 gigabytes of music and it still has about 2 more gigabytes of memory left. The battery life is prett good. I get about 10 hours with music and about 4 hours with video. I get about 6-8 hours wiht mixed useThere are only a few things that i can find thats wrong wiht it, One that you cannot transfer dvds over to the archos wiht your computer. Also it is sometimes slow to open files. This is normal though for a device with this many features.All in all i think this is a very good device. It has all the features a person into media and photography would want, including a compact flash slot which comes in handy alot, but this device does have its short commings. If you want the newest stuff i would opt for the new Av500 series."
1,Predictable and infantile,"Nature has its powers and we can learn a lot out of it. But from there, to actually beleive that people are intrinsically bad because somebody dreamt that he was a snake or a spider, or that he is the next avatar of humanity because he is a tiger or a jaguar, is childish. Many crimes have happened when people begin to believe that the unconscious world is part of the real world. With this kind of philosophy, it seems the power of belief takes over the power of awareness. This is a confusing book, far from its apparent good intention, it hides its purpose. I agree with other reviewers that it borders with indoctrination more than with a real sense of connection with nature."
1,Far from good,"With the apparent intention of setting up a new and very original paradigm in the world of animal esoteric meanings, the author tries with no success to describe what he calls, a revolution in the knowledge of allies.According to his vision, spiders and snakes are bad and jaguars and dolphins are good.... I think this kind of thought is quite infantile and yes, it is new and original, because no author ever dared to state something so ridiculous.Suryavan Solar usually calls privately that women who are too beautiful and talented, snakes, as if this would be the worst. All this kind of beleifs and superstitions, doesn't have anything to do with real native knowledge and wisdom.If this book pretends to be of some interest, maybe the author, should take new ideas of other books, such as Animal-Speak: The Spiritual & Magic Powers of Creatures Great & Small, of Ted Andrews, who with much sincerity and little pretense, shows a world where animals belong to a kingdom of awareness."
2,Where was the editor?,"Reading the other highly rated reviews for this book it almost seems like I was reading something different, but I'm not. Buyer beware!The book has great potential. However, there are a LOT of huge errors in this book. I counted over a dozen in as many pages. I went to the Cisco Press website for the addendum, and it only had corrections for the first few pages. The errors go way beyond what the addendum lists.If you're using this book alongside actual time on gear then you won't have problems finding the errors. If you don't, the book will be confusing at times.Every other Cisco Press book I've had has been good, and it's not uncommon to have an error or two in a technical book of this kind - but I was blown away at the lack of proofing.The book has indispensible examples, but always double check what you see with some practical examples on actual gear."
2,Learn Troubleshooting from the Errors in this Book!,HiThis book contains many mistakes but does fill a gap for those wanting to prepare for the CCNP with hands-on experience.I actually learned a lot from the mistakes in this book. But when you're studying on your own and trying to build your confidence on routing it is really disconcerting to not be able to reach the same results as the book. It's only with lots more reading (a good thing!) that you discover the screen output in the book isn't accurate!I think with the Errata in hand (or preferably a reprinted edition) this is still a book worth having but 4/5 star reviewers must not have followed the exercises on real equipment!Jc
2,18 pages of errata for this book!!!,"I just got this book, and went to cisco press to look for erratas'. There are 18 yes 18, pages of errata for this book! And at places even the errata is wrong. So cisco press please get your act together and reprint the book with the corrections."
2,Full of ridiculous and inexcusable errors,I don't know what the folks giving this book 5 starts are smoking. It's obvious they haven't read it. The errata contains only two minor corrections for a book with errors on nearly every page. How can configuration statements and command outputs that one would think were simply copied verbatim from a console session contain so many errors?And we're not just talking typographical errors and misprints. One exercise uses pings to test an access list-based route map on the same router. One problem: access lists are designed to filter traffic going through the router. They will not filter traffic that has originated from the router. So how was the sample output shown in the book generated? Was it just made up by the author?Shameful - absolutely shameful.
4,Decent enough game,"My son asked for a Batman computer game for Christmas, and this is what I found that was appropriate for his age. He likes the game and asks to play often. We have Vista on our computers, which is not supported for this game so I get a warning every time I put the disc in, but there don't seem to be any problems with it."
4,A great devotional!,"This devotional is wonderful. It talks about everything a teenage girl wants and needs to know about, from giving of yourself to dating. It has really helped me become closer to God as well as teaching me many things. If you are a teenage girl looking for a good devotional I would definately recomend this book."
2,Not good for kids...,"This is a decent trail mix but very nut and seed heavy, my kids did not like it at all - it needs a little more dried fruit added!I thought it was OK for myself but I won't order it again. Seems to be mostly sunflower and pumpkin seeds."
1,"Extract from &#65533;Books on Bosnia&#65533;, London 1999","A very theoretical study by a liberal intellectual. Rejects economic determinism and the idea that `the Balkans are different', but reduces everything to `ethnic strategies' and `power structures', and seems not to notice any difference between a peaceful `break-up' and a war of territorial conquest"
4,Nancy Agabian is interesting.,"Her book should inspire all who read it for its honesty. Once you open this book you will not be able to put it down, it really is that good! Her writing style is thoroughly beyond inventive! I urge you to buy this book in the very near future."
3,An unfinished project,"This video represents a project with plenty of research and plenty of good ideas, but it is lacking in quality. The narrators voice is pleasing and clear, but structure and storytelling is loose and it ends up being rather boring.There are several periods where there is no narration at all, just video. It seems like this was rushed out the door and not finished. It needs more material, more editing and a more structured program to complete the project.That said, it was a good start, and it's encouraging to see some people trying to present these facts and ideas."
2,An interesting account of the Leo Frank Case,"This is not a book of subtleties, the author makes his position very clear on case, but it is none-the-less an interesting account of the Leo Frank affair, written in the 1960's, by Ex-con felon Harry Golden."
4,"IT'S LIKE NO OTHER BOOK I'VE EVER READ, I LOVED IT!","THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THE BOOK IS BECAUSE OF THE TITLE. THE FIRST CHAPTER IS THE REASON WHY I LOVE THE BOOK SO MUCH. IT'S HYSTERICAL, SEXY AND MOVES QUICK. I NEED THAT IN A BOOK. I RECOMEND IT TO THE PERSON WHO CAN RELATE THE ROCK N ROLL TO THE SEX TO THE GROWING UP AND MOVING ON."
1,Fantasies of an angst-ridden pubescent child,"I wanted to like it. From the description, you'd think that this had all the qualities of captivating hard boiled story, but as I progressed, I became more indifferent as it becomes a clumsy comic book. The building metaphors were frustratingly tedious (just read a sample page, and imagine it multiplied by 100 before buying). Almost all the characters were simplistic and two dimensional; females were the worst. They have zero personality and seem to exist only as sexual sycophants, nymphs or nutjobs. I mean I guess a lot of pulp fiction has similar characters but I was expecting more depth. The protagonist creates and miraculously escapes his own conflicts, while nothing wrong with that, its recurrence becomes wearisome. I found little substance and the style fleeting."
4,This is going to be one hell of a motion picture...,"This past weekend, I read the first draft screenplay adaptation of James Robert Baker's FIEL-INJECTED DREAMS and was summarily BLOWN AWAY! I then obtained a copy of the book and was, impossibly, FURTHER BLOWN AWAY! To all fans of the book, the movie WILL do justice to the novel and I for one cannot wait to see James Robert Baker's vision fully realized on the silver screen."
4,"It's a good camera, mostly.","Well, I purchased this camera about a year ago for $600 on ebay and it does everything I want it to do. Great resolution, except with digital zoom, and ok stills. I took the pics displayed here with a sony dscw5 but the still quality you'll get with this camera on memory card are also displayed here.. As far as video quality, its still great for a 2-3 yrs old camera. I usually attach this camera via firewire to my pc and edit videos there. When i dont use a digital zoom thing look great! W/digital zoom not so well. I like the form factor and for the next 2-3 years I have no inclination to buy a new camcorder. Enjoy!"
1,The worst software bundle!,"Although the camera itself met my expectation I am extremely disappointed with the software quality it came with. The software itself is amateur software and not something you expect to get from Sony, especially after spending $1000.00 for it. The help file for the software is limited and short.Bottom line - buy it only if you have no plans to edit your work on your computer!"
3,Moving to Germany,I moved to Germany last year and I wanted a little book to throw in my purse that could help me with the language. This book was fine. I felt like there was a lot of words that I wanted to know that were not in this book. The food section wasn't very big and that is when you need the translation the most.
2,Can get it for less @ Crystal Classics,Nice glasses but too expensive (especially with how easy they break)! I went with Crystal Classics and got the exact Waterford set and paid $49 (free shipping).
2,Beware this is not Crystal,"The glasses are nice, but they are Glass and Not Crystal. This is a special type of glass that simulates Crystal, and other vendors have accurately labeled it as Crystaline. If you want real Crystal, keep looking."
1,Boring compilation,"Most arrangements are oversimlified and repetitive. Stellar songs are reduced to bland, uninviting arrangements. Its a pretty disheartening collection. Its well worth the trouble of trying to arrange them yourself.This compilation is boring and dull. Not worth the money!"
2,"James Bond, Buck Rogers & Jacques Cousteau all in one person","Either you'll love the non-stop action, or you'll laugh at the unlikely chain-of-events that lead to the book's climax. Dirk Pitt, who's been shot more times than a Texas Yield sign, takes on the evil Japanese Empire as they smuggle atomic bombs into America via imported cars. Oddly enough, the trillions of dollars spent on national defense can't stop a bunch of missiles cruising down Route 66 at 55 mph. This book panders to the anti-Japanese sentiment of the early nineties, which severely dates it, and makes it that much less believable. Cussler's Pitt novels have always been over-the-top in their villians, heroes and story plots, but this one will virtually assault your credulity sensors. I usually enjoy the roller coaster ride, but not this time."
3,Harmless Escapism,"""Dragon"" is only the second Clive Cussler novel I have read, the first being ""Raise the Titanic."" Although the unlikely plot could just as easily have been contrived by a daydreaming twelve-year-old boy, it was a fun piece of harmless escapism. All of the characters, both the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"", were of the standard, two-dimensional, cardboard-cutout variety. Basically, ""Scooby-Doo"" without the dog. Some (especially the ""politically correct"") may find the overtly anti-Japanese storyline offensive. I just found it overdone."
3,Atom Bombs and foreign intrigue make Dirk Pitt into a 00.,"Dragon is a bit run of the mill compared to some of Cussler's other Dirk Pitt books. Dirk's situation becomes a little to Bondish to keep with the tone of the previous novels.Those who like the Dirk series and Bond, James Bond novels will probably like this novel as much as I did."
5,Simply Dirk Pitt,"Rather classic Pitt novel, pretty straight forward, although you will find the plot a little more complex than the average Pitt novel. Don't spoil the fun considering how improbable the solution of events may be, how sci-fictional the gadgetry may appear or how incredible his deeds may seem...it's Dirk Pitt."
4,was as expected,arrived on a timely basis was what i expected don't have any further comments to make there was no damage
5,Full of adventure,Clive Cussler can really spin a great tale. I wouldn't miss any of his books. This one has ties in one of his later books. A must read.
4,Non-Stop Exciting Fiction That's Not Too Far From Reality!!!,"I am an avid Cussler fan and have read most of his books. ""Dragon"" is one of his best. It ranks a close second to ""Cyclops"". ""Dragon"" is a very thought-provoking novel in that it makes me wonder just how far off Cussler's baseline story reflects today's world. His use of robots made for the sole purpose of driving Japanese cars with hidden nuclear bombs to predetermined world locations is disturbing. Who knows how far an intelligent, industrialized nation could go if such a nation fell into the hands of the wrong power-hungry leaders? My only objection came at the end of the story. Without giving anything away, I found it hard to believe how Dirk Pitt managed to survive again! Oh, well. Such is fiction. Despite this minor complaint, ""Dragon"" is still a great entertaining read with nonstop action. I recommend it to all Cussler fans."
5,Best Yet,"This is Clive's best Dirk Pitt book ever!! It is full of action, suspense, and intrigue. This is a great book for someone to start reading Clive Cussler. I recommend it to anyone."
5,Dragon,My husband has really enjoyed anything he has read by Clive Cussler. He reads every one he can find.
1,WAY OVER RATED!!,"Was very dissappointed ... there were hardly any recipes in the book which is what I was looking for and wanted one for a gift and feel it is now a ""throw away""! I did get excellent shipping service but that is the only good thing about this purchase."
2,Much better polish cookbooks exist,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is not great and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. For the audience, it has some very convoluted recipes such as the Bigos and cabbage roll recipes which are over the top in terms of ingredients used. The rest are ho hum and could be representative of any european country without a truely defined cuisine.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
2,Not a user's manual,"The earlier reviewer is right: This is not a user's manual. Peterson doesn't explain his ideas with straight, clear prose. Rather, he waxes poetic and writes rather circularly, going round and round a point well after it is established, but not necessarily shedding new light on it each time. But then, that shows my preference in style; others apparently really like it.I think the book also is for the already-converted, those already familiar with his basic ideas and who share his assumptions. It is not for the non-Christian or the non-traditional Christian, especially since it seems to define ""the spiritual life"" (rather than ""a spiritual life"") only in Biblical terms, despite the spiritual practices and wisdom of many non-Biblical faiths."
2,The Message Bible is great; this is not,The Message Bible is excellent; his other books are not.I flipped through it and sent it back.
5,Heirloom quality wooden toys,"I discovered Plan City Wooden toys rather by accident, but they are ""the best."" The quality and detail is amazing--and appear to be toys that will withstand lots of use."
5,Fun and simple toys,This set was also purchased with the Plan Toys fire engine. All three vehicles in the set are of great quality and have been able to endure both a 3 year-old's and 6-year old's daily wear and tear. It would make a wonderful gift for little truck lovers.
3,"Fun Project, But Very Fragile","We bought this for our 6 year old daughter. She enjoyed the activity of painting and decorating the horse to her taste, but I would say this horse is fairly fragile.It was slightly damaged when we received it and two of the horses legs broke off shortly after from adults looking at it.The positives are that it's inexpensive and still a very nice gift idea for kids who love horses."
5,Great Toy for a Little Artist/Horse Lover,"My daughter received this as a gift for her 5th birthday, and it was one of the first things she wanted to play with. She really enjoyed painting it and loves having it hanging in her room. We found that it is extremely well made. Each horse is one of a kind because it is hand carved. The only down side is that we did not have quite enough paint, so we had to buy more."
2,This may not be the director's cut,"If the running length is 187 minutes as claimed, then the film has been cut by about 16 minutes. Perhaps the distributor trimmed the film to make it fit on a single disc? Cutting a single frame out of a Manoel de Oliveira film is inexcusable. The film should be seen in its proper aspect ratio and running time."
1,I could live with the video transfer if not for the sound,"This is a great film, but I am going to try to return the DVD as the soundtrack is dubbed in French. It isn't the original Portugese.I don't own the U.S. VHS and don't know if it is also French, but I DO own a transferred copy of the U.K. PAL VHS and it is most clearly in Portugese. Even the pitch of the narrator's voice is different between the two versions.I don't know if this was deliberate (I hope not, since the DVD box claims it is Portugese) or if they used the wrong film master, but it makes a tremendous difference.Also, the sound is distorted in part of chapter 4, but I could even live with that if it was in the right language.I was really looking forward to this and I'm too upset to even come up with a sappy response for the Where in the world are you? box as is my custom."
1,Scruples Snooth Out Shampoo LITER,Merchant falsely advertised that shampoo was LITER size (33 oz) and I received only 12 oz bottles. Monetarily that means with buying 5 liter bottles and receiving 5 12 oz bottles that I am now paying almost 3 TIMES the price per ounce. Merchant wouldn't honor price advertised on a per ounce basis and told me to return them. HUGE INCONVENIENCE WITH NO COMPROMISE FOR THEIR INCORRECT DESCRIPTION!!!!
1,great magazine!!!!!!!!,I have been buying this magazine off and on ever since the first issue. I keep all of the issues and enjoy looking at them over time again and again. I enjoy the articles and interviews of the stars and the informative ads on where to get merchandise. Thank you for a wonderful magazine...there are so few of them out on the newsstand.
1,I haven't received a copy yet to review,You've sent this review request out too early. I have yet to receive anything from the publisher to review. I have bought from the newstand in the past and enjoyed it.
3,Cowboys & INDIAN'S!!!,"O.k., what indian's? Sometimes i will will go two mags, before they'll have a small arctial about an indian artiest, I realy think we can't do anthing ealles! But we are not arties, and we are not all on a Res.!"
4,Frightening,"I starting this short novel in the afternoon and was done before I went to bed that night - but some of the images and descriptions were so horrific and startling that I literally had to put the book down and take a short break from it. Nevertheless, I was constantly drawn back. Iweala's book is frightening because it is so honest, yet incredibly horrific. He successfully describes a young boy unwillingly transforming into a killer - his unfortunate idea of adulthood. The reader fights along with Agu's struggle as he contemplates his life and struggles to imagine what he still has in store for him."
4,a universal language of conflict,Iweala's book is an introspective take on what geos on on the inside of those caught in rthe middle of all kinds of conflict.The language of Agu is one that conveys innocence violated
2,"traumatizing, and quiet","Beasts of No Nation creates a image of horror for the readers, but the matter of fact tone it unfolds in left me wondering why I had read so many pages of horror. All I was left with was how aweful this boy's life was, and I could of guessed that from the back of the book"
4,creatively written,Children in war is such a heart wrenching topic and this young man wrote with creative style the pain experienced.
1,A Waste,"Okay, imagine yourself as a child in a war torn West African nation. You're forcefully drafted into a guerilla army where you are forced to kill, witness horrible violence, suffer sexual abuse from your captain, and generally have to march and suffer without any real understanding of the army's purpose or goals. Are you picturing what that would feel like for a child? Well, then you now have as much insight into the subject as Iweala demonstrates. This felt like a book that absolutely anybody could have written. I would recommend skipping it."
2,Lacks emotional appeal,"Beasts of No Nation is about a young boy named Agu who is captured as a soldier in a war in Africa. Little is known about what the soldiers are fighting for, or what they do. It was written in Agu's voice,and his point of view. The book is easy to read, but in my opinion lacked the emotional appeal one would expect from a novel of this subject. Also, the author does a poor job of characterization. We know little about Agu, except his innocence, and it is hard for the reader to become attatched to him or any other characters."
1,Sorry but I don't get it,I was really looking forward to reading this work as I'm very interested in what is going on in Africa and I am a writer as well. I found this work almost impossible to read as it does not adhere to any form of English that I have ever read. The story is probably great but that's moot if one finds it too difficult to read. Interesting that one of the reviewers on book's jacket cover commends the writing for coming up with a new form of English. God bless them both but maybe they know not what they do.
5,Can't live without my Lampe Berger,If you are a candle fan you will be a Lampe Berger fanatic. Love mine and this is my favorite scent.
4,Great Holiday Fun!,"I bought this puzzle to assemble with a family of 10 during Christmas. It was a lot of fun and once we committed a little time to the puzzle, we were hooked and couldn't stop until it was finished. The main ages at work on the puzzle was me (32), my sister-in-law (28) and my mother (54). Along with us was my daughter, who is age 6. To our complete & utter surprise, she had a wonderful time helping and did an excellent job! I honestly thought this puzzle would be too difficult for her (as the pieces are small and there are quite a lot of them), but we were all pleasantly amazed to see she had worked out an entire face by herself!! She loved it and we all had a wonderful time working on it together.The only con about the puzzle is the colors are not as vibrant as I would have liked. They are, however, just like shown in the photo. You can see by the photo that it is a bit grainy, just like the movie.All in all, it a wonderful puzzle to do together during the Christmas holiday."
4,Great EDC knife after a little maintenence,"I carry a knife as a tool for work and recreation, not as a weapon. Regardless of what some couch-cowboy tells you on YouTube or whatever you see in the movies, rarely does anyone ever win a knife fight.Anyway, on with the review.Pros:LightweightSturdy, blade has no wiggleFeatures a safetyEasy one hand deploymentSize makes it comfortable in the pocket and nonthreatening to law enforcementLow priceCons:Blade sharpness out of the box was mediocre at best (a run on the sharpening stone solved that)Closing the blade felt grainy, like there was sand in the mechanism (a little gun oil fixed it right up)The safety button is loose, almost free floating; I wish it would click into place.The material the handle is made of though quite strong and durable, looks cheap"
1,Don't waste your money on it.,"I have tried using this radio in my house with no luck. I live in a city with multiple radio stations and only one was audible but still had static. I tried it while camping as well. The campground was pretty much in a city where other campers' radios had great reception. I tried hanging the radio from a tree, from the middle of the tent and even around my neck. Nothing worked.The problem with this radio is that when it's in your hand, the radio station sounds fine. As soon as your hand moves away from the tuner, the static overtakes the reception. I'm not sure if a homemade antenna would work or not, but it shouldn't be needed for something that's supposed to be portable and convenient.I've had cheaper radios that worked better than this one. Don't waste your money on it. (I wish I could give it zero stars.)"
4,"A dwarf, Barry Manilow, and Sally Jesse Raphael","I had never heard of this movie and had just assumed that I had somehow managed to miss it in general release, but then I read a review that said New line never released it in the theatres, to avoid the embarassment of a theatrical release of this monstrosity. That being said, I loved this movie! It is totally bizarre in every way, but I would say it's at least as good as About Schmidt, of which the plot bears a vague resemblance, and I would much rather watch this again than that. The cast involves Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, a sassy dwarf, Barry Manilow, and Sally Jesse Rafael, among others. It's weird and funny and touching and I think not releasing it in theatres shows a definite lack of imagination. The eight people who have reviewed it so far seemed to like it, and I bet if more than people actually saw it, they would like it, too."
4,Unconditional approval,"This is an unexpected film that offers something for everyone. A small dose of singing and schmaltz is offset by a little light serial killing and black humour - all in perfect harmony. Like prosciutto with melon - it sounds odd, but you'll be glad you tried it. Rupert Everett is excellent, and Julie Andrews and Richard Briers are always a pleasure to watch."
5,Kathy Bates Rocks!,"Kathy Bates turns in yet another great performance!This is an enjoyable movie from beginning to end, highly recommended!"
4,DELIGHTFUL,"This is a delightful comedy with a good cast, great music.very enjoyable. Cameo appearances of Julie Andrews, Barry Manilow were great."
4,"""A LIfe Lived In Fear Isn't Much Fun""","Chicago housewife Kathy Bates has an obsessive crush on recording heartthrob Victor Fox (Jonathan Pryce). When he is murdered before she can meet him, she decides to attend his funeral in England, where she lands in the middle of a battle for his reputation: on one side his sister (Lynn Redgrave), on the other his gay lover (Rupert Everett). Wild chases, wacky comedy, and sentimental soul-searching ensue. Barry Manilow and Julie Andrews show up as themselves, while Dan Ayckroyd, Peter Sarsgard, and Jack Noseworthy wind up chasing them all. It's a very cute movie that will make you feel good. Beware the dwarf in the red raincoat."
5,Hilarious,"This movie could not be better. I enjoyed it completely. Definitely not for children, but wonderfully funny for adults. It kept me guessing and laughing the whole way through!"
3,Strangely entertaining mish-mash,"This is a very odd film. It is terribly uneven, oddly structured and moves at an awkward pace. It is however very entertaining in a weird, sweet way. Bates is, as always, luminous. I don't thing she can ever do anything wrong. Her Grace is the heart of this odd unclassifiable film. Sometimes very funny, sometimes heartfelt, sometimes VERY weird. It defies a real written decscription that would indicate how it actually plays. Self acceptance and living life are big themes here - positive themes both - but when you mix in a sassy, surly dwarf, the ghost of a gay pop-star, a murder mystery, Barry Manilow, Sally Jesse Raphael, mid-life crisis/family drama, and a couple of weird hysterically funny Julie Andrews cameos, you get a wildy uneven yet warm oddball film. Definitely worth watching - but have no expectations in any direction for maximum effect."
1,A waste all around,"This confused, badly written jumble of a film is an insult to the fine acting ability of Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett and a waste of time for those able to endure it. It isn't a comedy, an adventure, a soap opera, or much of anything else. You wait until the last five minutes to learn that it's all about how good homosexuals can be and that life can be truly fulfilled by singing on television. This one goes in the golden turkey book. My copy goes quickly into the garbage."
4,Kathy Sings,"First let me say I love Kathy Bates. This is at least as good as Misery or Fried Green Tomatoes if not better. She is particularly good in the scenes where she must have a flat effect. From pathos to suspence to comedy this movie has it all. I was hysterical for the Sundance scene. And then Kathy sings. I have heard her with small bits but in this one she really cuts loose. From softly singing to herself to making the rafters ring and she is really very good. The supporting cast does a marvelous job. The only thing that bothered me was the ""Fox"" singing numbers - the chorograghy was not the best. It was stiff and abrupt, not like I have seen him move before. After you find out that his character was [homosexual] it could make sense. This is a welcome addition to my collection."
1,"Lame, total waste of talent","I love Kathy Bates, but this movie, with a great cast never takes off or hits a mark. Julie Andrews doing ""Getting to Know You"" once was quite enough,there was no need for an encore.It is a bad ""gay"" movie, and a bad ""straight"" movie. The start is incredibly slow and bland and when Miss Bates lands herself in England, hopefully to pick up the pace, it continues on it's banal course. This movie needs some spice, a lot more wit and a much faster pace. There is no comparing this to Muriel's Wedding or Four Weddings and a Funeral. This is a gaggy sweet over predictable piece of maribou fluff, that not even a sight gag like the ""corpse in drag"" can save."
4,mememe,Fast delivery. It has worked well for drywall for the past couple of months and seems to be holding strong. For half the price of a new one it is a great buy.
2,pretty much useless,"This is a tool that nobody really needs. It's heavy for it's size, can't do much with it and the majority of accessories are sanding pads."
3,"Tool not sturdy enough, customer support questionable","The depth guide bracket will not lock in place and Tool King only sent a ""form letter"" response to my question. I won't do business with them again. However, the tool was ""good as new"" cosmetically and, other than the depth guide, seems to be working fine."
2,It worked for 5 minutes,"This is the first time I've had a problem with a factory reconditioned tool. It completely stopped working on it's first day of use. It worked for 5 minutes and then shut down as if I unplugged it. My first reaction was that it came unplugged, then I thought maybe my GFI circuit tripped, then I checked the fuse box - - - I checked everything. The return process is slow. First you've got to request authorization to return it, wait for them to respond, then wait for them to mail a return label by truck, then mail it back in slow mode and then wait for them to process the refund. They're on the west coast and I'm on the east coast. All transactions are by truck. I received my refund but like I said it's a slow process."
3,Cheap But Good,"Although this is obviously a low-budget film, it is far better than most of its more expensive brethren. It is suspenseful, almost frightening in places, and with an interesting twist at the end. Although looking somewhat chunky, Yvonne DeCarlo turns in a credible performance as the proprietress of a rooming house which is also inhabited by her insane daughter. Comedian Avery Schreiber, in the role of a detective, is also rather good. In all, it is a very entertaining little horror film, recommended for late-night viewing. Get it - you'll like it!"
4,A Top Fun & Scary Movie For Its Time,"Silent scream is a movie that was a slasher film made in a time in the early 80s where everyone wanted to ""cash"" in on slasher films. While this film is not an academy award winning film, it was scary for its time. This is another one of my picks for people who collect vintage 80s slasher films. Most younger people will probably laugh at most of it, some of the hard-core collectors will find it a gem. The film has never been on DVD until now, so I'm sure all the people out there can maybe actually put that vhs player away.There are sill more vintage 80s slasher films that I wish would be re-released on DVD/BLU RAY titles like ""Hell Night"". I can only keep crossing my fingers!"
4,"Forgotten gem,","This was a late entry and star turn by Barbara Steele, and I enjoyed it very much.One of the reasons she is one of the 'classic' scream queens."
1,to bad that besides being silent it wasn't invisible as well,"this was the worst movie i have seen in a long time> the acting was bad ,the story was a joke, and it didn't have one good scare or even a chill. save your money."
1,This product was cheaply made and didn't match expectations,"I was quite surprised to receive this product only to find that it was so small. The size of these little globes are perfect for a small apartment balcony but certainly not for anything larger. The lights are too close to eachother - about 12"" apart and the entire string about 3' long. Not quite what I had in mind. If your looking for a nice outdoor patio light for festive occasions, this is not the best choice."
4,Enjoy our patio,"I found these lights originally at Kohls however they were cheaper on Amazon. Ordered 2 sets to go on our patio and they work perfectly. Each string is about 6 feet long and the lights are 12 inches apart. When on, they provide a good amount of light. Looking to order some more."
2,Ooooo... Pictures...,"This book is more or less useless on it's own. It tries to make tiling look really simple and straightforward. Tiling is actually not rocket science at all, but you really do need to spend time up front deciding what you are going to do. It isn't a weekend project. Get a real book written by someone who actually lays tile professionally and not just by people who sell the latest half-baked do it yourself supplies. I recommend ""Tile Your Word"" or ""Setting Tile"". Both top notch books. In fact, get both - given how expensive tile is it'll be worth the money.This book does have some nice pictures of some steps though. That's about all I can recommend it for."
2,Could have been a free pamphlet,"I bought this book at Home Depot and returned it after a few hours upon finishing it. I could have got the same information from a free pamphlet. They ought to be ashamed. However, there were some nice pictures and I did learn a little bit, but it was just a super easy primer for the real thing. I didn't buy another book before tiling 900sf in my house. I wish I had bought a better book, as I learned all kinds of tricks ""the hard way."" Hint: Swimming after tiling all day can return your back to normal when it doesn't seem like anything else will help. I am now going to buy John Bridge's book before my next tiling job."
4,good,"This is a good book for people who want to start tiling or for people who have stated but would like to get more ideas, help or tricks."
4,A great documentary without the Madison Ave hype,"I like documentaries about something that isn't full of hype. It's about the human experience.The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West VirginiaandThe King of Kong: A Fistful of Quartersare just two examples of products that haven't made it on to mainstream TV, but are masterpieces. Walk by Scott Herriot is another. Like the other two videos, Walk will take you to where you can't go yourself.Trust me on this."
2,Dull account of a fascinating life,"This biography of L.M. Montgomery, marketed towards young adults, has nothing new to offer. It was mostly a rehash of Montgomery's own memoirs, titled ""The Alpine Path"". Plus, there was surprisingly little information about Montgomery's years after she published Anne. Perhaps it would have been at least an average bio if the author had illustrated some of Montgomery's experiences or parts of her life, but he really didn't even attempt to do that, with the exception of parts of some of her minor romances. If you are looking for a good L.M. Montgomery biography, try ""The Alpine Path"" or her journals to hear about Montgomery in her own words."
3,Lavender scent too strong for my use,"If you are sensitive to scents, I would not recommend this particular neem soap as the lavender scent is over powering. I haven't been able to use this soap so I can't really say if I would like it otherwise."
2,Great concept but im convinced of a design defect.....,"I bought this product reconditioned and didnt use it until 5 months later because of a move.I have used it 4 times now and it cooks beautifully. One has to watch it constantly but the meat doesnt lose any of its juiciness. My only problem is that this piece of equipment has a history of breaking or being defective. Now , after 4 uses , the switch seems to have a ""short"" in it.While the product is excellent , I feel that attention needs to be given to its myriad malfunctions.I give this a 2 rating because the performance at its ""best "" doesnt compensate for the additional cost of repair and replacement."
1,I should have listened,I can't believe that Amazon continues to offer this product. I received the first with heat reflector missing. I had a replacement sent with the same part missing. I should have paid more attention to the reviews about missing parts. I couldn't wait for the shipment to arrive and then to be so upset. Why offer such a product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Unsatisfactory Condition,"I received this in a timely manner, yet there were parts missing that should have been included. Also, the timer was broken, it sets but does not count down. I would be cautous before buying a reconditioned item again."
2,"Food comes out great, but poor quality machine","Chickens come out especially great! I have also tried steaks, fish and vegetables. All come out quite well. The quality of the machine, however, lacks much to be desired. I have had several parts break, so many that I bought the extended warranty from Ronco for $(...). However, it is still a pain to have to wait several weeks for a replacement to come. What broke in mine was the power knob, the plastic runners (where the glass door retreats) and the rob rusted. All in all, I'd take a look at the George Foreman rosisserie!"
4,Love this rotisserie,"To date I have cooked a two-rib roast, chicken, and a 'hotel sytle' (with wings) turkey breast in my reconditioned rotisserie.Everything came out wonderful!Only one complaint, it is not easy to make gravy with this as one would in a roasting pan. For my turkey, I could not add carrots, celery, and onion as I normally do so that I can later make a gravy.Although this is a drawback, it is not one to prevent me from enjoying this gadget. I'll experiment with using the stock and drippings and later boiling them with carrots, celery, and onion to make the gravy.Also is easy to store. When in use I set it on my cooktop which has continuous grates so it is quite stable. When not in use, it is light enough for me to carry to the basement, where it sits til I need it again.Glad I made this purchase and at 69.99, the price was right!"
3,It's good BUT!,"and that is a ""BIG BUT"". It cooks great and I like it BUT as a few others have mentioned it gets VERY HOT as it is all sheet metal and there is NO insulation like in NONE, ZIPP, NADA. You cannot use this product under kitchen cabinets or anywhere you do not have a great deal of ventilation on both sides, above and especially behind where the heating element is located. I place it on the serving shelf outside the kitchen window or use it on the Patio. The glass door on the front comes off of the tracks with the slightest touch and it does not really close. It more leans against the unit. You must be careful with your hands full not to knock it off and break it. There are also several accessories to get lost or misplaced. Save the rubber gloves included for washing the car."
1,Didn't hold up to the test of time,"I loved cooking with this product. I might have used it about 10 times. The food turned out delicious. However, my Ronco started to fall apart. Small pieces of plastic (from the track that holds the door) fell off every time I used it. The oven door no longer closes securely. I have tried repeatedly to reach the company and cannot get through to them. My letters go unanswered, and my Ronco collects dust in the basement."
5,This product is the BEST,"We use our rotisserie at least 2 or 3 times per week. It is easy, the food is delicious and clean up is a snap as I put the parts in the dishwasher. It is not exactly, set it and forget it, but close! I highly recommend it. Our reconditioned machine works just as well as a brand new one and I saved a lot of money."
5,Best Buy I Have Made in Ages!,"As a busy person who loves to cook, I am thrilled with my new rotisserie and find myself planning meals around its capabilities several times a week. What a time-saver it is to cook the meat while a side dish from the freezer reheats in the tray on top. So far I have tried a turkey breast, chicken, shish-k-bobs, a beef roast, and a pork roast...all done to perfection. Clean up is simple. I am replacing my upright Faberware rotisserie with this one because it is so much easier to remove the hot food and to clean. I believe the capacity is greater also.This was my first experience with any type of reconditioned machine and I have not been disappointed. It came out of the box looking brand new, and lives up to every claim I saw in the infomercial that got me interested in the first place."
5,pro model,I got mine right before thanksgiving 2002. I was worried about doing my turkey in it but it turned out great the best we ever had. Only draw back I had to cook the stuffing separate but it was woth it. since then we have made roasts and boneless chicken and steaks in it. my husband is on the atkins diet and loves the food i make in it. i love this almost as much as my microwave. If you have the room in your kitchen or for it on a cart get this one.
3,Ok for Now,"I tried this for the first time with a rib roast. It was ok, cooked fast, but not as tasty and tender as my oven cooked rib roast. Clean up was a hassle since the parts are fairly large...I had to wash them twice to get the grease off. I will reserve judgement until I cook a chicken on it...I'm hopeful that it will be great. The reconditioned aspect doesn't seem to make a difference...it looks brand new to me. (Most of the reviews are so positive here, I wonder if Ronco planted some shills...)"
1,Very Disappointed with Missing Peices,The missing peices from this shipment have me re-thinking ordering from Amazon. There is no apparent method for contacting this merchant to request the missing peices and without it my Rotisserie is inoperable. I just went to the Popeil website to buy the peices which will cost me another $40!!!
3,Watch out for the Sqeak - May be treatable,"I bought this item. It cooks well, especially good for boneless pork roast and chickens. Don't count on it for even small turkeys, however. Too small - Sometimes the unit makes a loud scraping, squeaking sound (like a moan) as the spit turns. Annoying, especially after 30 minutes or so of it. Trying to figure out why - Guessing - Maybe the sides are not quite parallel or some tolerance was off, so the rotating end of the spit is binding when weighted down? Just found a note on the manufacturer's web site's FAQs - says that if the thing sqeals when turning you can add vegetable oil to the gears section - I'll try that next time I use it. Maybe it wasn't a defect of my reconditioned unit after all."
2,Tastes good but very poor quality,"THe food taste great out of this thing, but mine broke a lot and the parts are expensive to replace. Working with Ronco was a pain. Personally, I would get the George Foreman."
2,Would be nice if it were hotter.,"Seems easy enough to use and clean. But it doesn't seem to get hot enough. First night I did a chicken. Looked wonderful, but gave it an extra 10 minutes and it still was a little pink in places. Next night I tried chicken kabobs. It said 35 minutes. After 35 minutes I used my meat thermometer which said medium rare(did not get to ""well"", or ""poultry""). I gave it extra 30 minutes, and it still read medium rare. I finished them on my barbeque, they were a bit dry. I know it's under warranty but I'm not sure I want to spend the time and postage (both ways) for another refurb that might not work."
5,Showtime Indispensible,"I have two homes---one in N.C. and another in Florida and travel frequently between the two. I enjoyed the machine so much that I lugged it with me on each 600 mile trip in order to cook chicken/turkey just the way I wanted it. When I saw the ad for the reconditioned models on the Amazon site, I jumped at the chance to purchase the second one for convenience sake and now get the best chicken/turkey in both locations. On the negative side, I'm not as happy with the results when I roast a beef as it takes much longer than the suggested time in order to get the desired degree of doneness. But then I don't cook a roast near as often as I do chicken. Regardless, I don't think you can beat this product for ease of use and final results."
3,"Good product, BUT...","No question, this thing makes good food. Here's the problems no one mentioned:First, the thing will heat up the whole house. It is poorly insulated and is like running an oven with the door open. I can't imagine using it in the summer months. I'm thinking of plugging it in outside if I use it.Second, the thing has MANY parts that require cleaning. The rods, the gear wheels, the drip tray, the drip tray cover, the basket, the basket cover. WHEW! It's worth the cleanup to do a chicken or turkey for a family. It is NOT for single people, and I'd question using it for any small portions. Maybe people who like to cook for the entire week..."
2,Bad Luck with Rotisseries,"I orginally order Factory-Reconditioned Ronco Inventions 3000TFS Showtime Indoor Compact Rotisserie & BBQ and I attempted to use it 3 different times and all time is smelled like a burning element. It was a very odoress smell to the point that I was not able to continue to use or keep it. I then ordered the Factory-Reconditioned Ronco Inventions ST4000R Showtime Indoor Rotisserie and Barbecue and that was missing several parts: the relector plate that goes behind the heating element (not able to use machine without it safely), the kebab rods and flavor injector. I feel very frustrated as the only way to communicate is through email and internet, you do not get to talk to an actual person. I hope that the replacement they are sending me will bring me good luck and work properly."
5,Best Chicken I've Ever Had,I received the Ronco Rotisserie yesterday and tried it on baby back ribs first. They came out only so-so.I cooked a 4.3 pound chicken in it this morning. I used the supplied injector to inject Italian dressing into the chicken and cooked for 65 minutes and then switched to the rotation only (no heat) mode until it cooled. It was golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside. I couldn't ask for anything better.Cleanup was really easy. No sand blasting required. Just a little soap and brushing with a toothbrush (yes it was new) on a couple of parts and it was as good as new.I read on Usenet that using aluminum foil on top of rhe drip tray and puncturing it to provide drainage makes cleanup even easier. I guess I will try that next time.I'm looking forward to trying a roast.
4,If you have ever 'bought' a rotisserie chicken & loved it...,"You have to get this machine!! The reason I only gave it a 4 star is because I noticed when I've cooked chickens it tends to smoke making the house smokey. Other then that the food is absolutely DELICIOUS!! I would highly recommended this product and even being factory reconditioned you would never be able to tell it. AND the price was right! The wheels squeaked a bit so now before cooking I apply a bit of cooking oil to each area and that solves that! When I cooked my first chicken, my husband and I sat and ate the whole thing! Clean up is fairly easy. Order one today! I really don't think you would be sorry."
5,Great Product ... Easy to Use ... Easy to Clean,"Bought a reconditioned model ... and cooked my first chicken the same night it arrived ... rounded a 4 1/2 LB chicken up to 5 lbs and set the timer for 1 Hour 15 minutes .... I'm a pretty decent cook and I have NEVER made a chiken this good .... very succulent and it came off the spit at EXACTLY 175 degrees.There was a little more clean up ... you have to wash the glass front , the spits, the grease catcher and the reflective shield but all of these parts come out easily ... and only took a few minutes longer than normal clean up.I bought this rotisserir for day to day cooking ... of small things ... and would give it 6 stars if i could ... havent tried it for real large birds or roasts but since i rarely ever cook those meals its not an issue ..."
4,initial use,I cooked a turkey on the rotisserie and it came out very moist and good. Only drawback is that the tie strings kept breaking and the turkey skin was a little overcooked.GREAT BUY!!! I'M SATISFIED
3,ROTISSERIE & BBQ,"Kabobs are verty good using shrimp, pineapple chunks, green pepper and squash. I need more skewers!"
1,Ronco Indoor Rotisserie,"Not impressed with this indoor rotisserie. It does not get hot enough to brown the meat sufficiently. The warming tray, (we thought came with the unit), is an additional charge. We did not have very good luck contacting them either. We will be putting this item into the next rummage sale."
3,"Great design, poor quality.","As I assemble the parts, I am impressed with the thoughtfulness inherent in many aspects of the design, but the build quality leaves much to be desired. During the first cooking session, the spit assembly drops down from its proper position. Upon close inspection, I conclude that the side walls are made of too thin a sheet of metal and they flex under the weight of the 6-pound rib. I put small pieces of aluminum foil into the holes in the gear wheel where the spit rods is supposed to go, thus effectively lengthening the spit assembly. This solves the problem. In general, though, the whole machine will clearly benefit from thicker and stronger material."
5,excellent quality,"excellent quality, long wear life, rugged,has good high quality metal buttons ,(instead of those cheap plastic ones)i will purchase these again and again !"
1,Returned,"I ordered these LP700 pants and received a different style, there was no hidden expandable waist. The pants run very small in the waist and butt. I returned them and right away received an email from the company that they got the pants and will return my money."
2,Not comfort waist band,"I ordered the comfort waist band and received regular pants... if you are looking for the comfort waist band, be careful, you might not receive what you order... the material is pretty thin also... I would not order this again."
3,No elastic waistband,"For some reason, the pants I got did not have an elastic waistband, which means they're not as comfortable as I expected. The front pockets are not as deep as they should be, so I have to be careful that my car keys don't fall out when I sit down. Otherwise they're okay. The size and color were as specified. I actually like the fact that the material was lighter weight than most work pants, which makes them more comfortable indoors."
2,NOT WHAT EXPECTED,"WAS NOT QUITE HAPPY WITH THESE DICKIES WORKPANTS. THE MATERIAL WAS THINNER THAN EXPECTED. THE POCKETS WERE NOT AS DEEP. THERE IS MATERIAL STITCHED INTO THE BACK SEAMS THAT ALMOST MAKE THESE LOOK LIKE THEY ARE ""SECONDS"". THEY ALSO TOOK ABOUT A MONTH TO RECEIVE IN THE MAIL.I HAD ORDERED FOUR PAIRS OF THESE WORKPANTS FOR MY HUSBAND, BECAUSE YOU CAN NO LONGER FIND THEM IN WALMART.ALL THE WHOLE I CAN SAY I WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED IN MY PURCHASE."
2,"Decent work pant, but poor quality for a Dickie...",Thinner than the 874 Original Dickie.Yet all inside pockets are made of a thicker cloth?Nice elastic waistband parts. A good feature...A few loose threads sticking out. Poor quality control I would not expect from Dickie...Cell phone pocket (with snap button) is a great idea.But my smart phone is to long to fit upright and may get scratched by the metal button inside. I kinda have to turn it on its side to fit which is uncomfortable while sitting down at my desk. And my cellphone skin gets linty inside the pocket...Great idea. It just dosnt work for me. I'll stick with the original Dickes in the future... Ill have to clip my phone to my belt...
5,Creepy,This boook was provided to me on a promotional status and I can't belive how graphic it is. It caught me by the throat and wouldnt let me go until I was in tears. I liked it.
3,Just info,"""Memoir by John Murrell A play about Sarah Bernhrdt's Last Summer"" was published by Avon Books, ""Bard Books"" edition,, in 1979, NYC.A brand new paperbook copy is available for sale."
2,Way too small!!,"Unfurtunatelly sizes are way too small, I ordered extra large and it could fit a very thin teenager. Good quality, but totally useless due to the size."
2,Creepy fit,"This brief creeps into a wedge. Fabric is very comfortable, bright color, and amazing stretch! But it can't stretch enough."
1,Not seamless!,"This is advertised as seamless, but it is NOT seamless. The edges show both on top and around the rear area, with bulges. Unsightly, and very disappointed. Would not buy again."
1,How many per package????,"Would like to consider purchasing these, but have seen nowhere where is says how many come in a package??? Does not seem to be listed in the item description. Is this a 3 pack,6 pack....What???? Would be nice to know. I would hate to spend $11.99 and receive only 1 pair of underwear."
1,Disappointed,"As a femme crossdresser, I can't recommend these panties. They aren't sexy and they don't have that silky feel to them to make me feel dainty. I guess its the small amount of spandex in these panties that ruin the feel. I like microfiber but these feel more like cotton. When I put on a pair of panties, I want that silky sissy feeling. Oh well I've bought some other wonderful panties here."
2,do not stay in place,"These underwear are pretty and the material is fine. That said, they do not stay in place on the backside. Not comfortable."
5,Not Just For Women!,"Holds the Package nice, great for every day ware and workouts too!No frilly edges,stretches to fit nice,price is right. I have a 36"" waist LG fits good."
3,Birthday gift.,"This item was a birthday gift, and so it's okay. No complaints from the person who received this item as a gift.."
4,Prophet of the Sandlot (The Best-Ever ML Baseball Scout ?),"First off, I purchased this as a ""Used"" book through Amazon via another seller, and the quality of the book I received was outstanding ! No problems there !The book & story itself is certainly a must read for the avid baseball fan ! Well written and informative, with a lot of real-life connections that help make it very real (ever hear of a baseball player named Mike Schmidt ? Guess who signed him ?!). And there certainly were some unexpected twists to the story !"
5,A great journey,"This is a very good book, and a great counterpoint to the statistical emphasis that comes across in Moneyball. From the revelation in the preface to the journey you take with Tony across Ohio and over the years, this book is tremendously engaging. It's one of the best baseball books I have ever read. And one other thing -- I'm going to take Tony's advice, and make sure my son has a wall."
4,"Overall pretty good, but I have one complaint...","For the most part, this book is pretty good. However, I was disappointed that the author uses the term ""Killer Whale"" instead of ""Orca!"""
2,Not what I thought it would be.,Book was not what I was looking for. Way to technical for me. Not in layman's terms which is what I need.
4,My review on The Tower Of Terror.,"I Like the movie. Some parts might be scary for younger viewers. I can't wait to go on the ride, next year at Disneyland."
4,fun family entertainment!,...i especially enjoyed the twist towards the end of the film...intriguing plot and lots of suspense...a nice family thriller!
5,Liked it a lot,In typical Disney fashion this film was fun to watch for folks who are old enough to enjoy the traditional Disney stuff. Special effects weren't as great as they said they were (but in this day and age it's hard to keep up with those on a Disney budget) but they were good enough. Loved what I thought were actual shots of the MGM Tower of Terror that seemed to be interlaced into the film. Sure looked like it. Great film for the whole family to watch.Steve
4,Fun and Suspense for Family Enjoyment--Especially Disney Studio's Fans,"Cute movie with some light suspense and plenty of humor; great enjoyment for the family who visits and likes the Disney Studio's theme park ride ""Tower of Terror""; looks like much of the movie was shot using the Disney property Hollywood Tower Hotel (you'll recognize the setting in many of the shots). A fun movie to watch with the kids!"
4,Shopping for videos,I searched high and low at every retail store for this video. No more. Amazon is now my first and last stop when I am looking for an older movie.
2,waste of time and money,I was excited when i bought this but then i watched it and it left me in complete dissapointment. if your smart you wont buy it
4,"Great Movie of a New Disney Ride, I wouldn't go on it, But..","As I was saying on the intro, I would not go on the ride, but the story is a sure Hoot. You see, I live only 40 minutes from WDW in Florida and go often enough to make a annual pass a necessity, but You see, I'm acrophobic, scared of hieghts and the last thing I want to do is to be dropped from a very high hieght, especially several times on purpose. Now the story was highly engaging and fun. The characters are such that you would feel for them and the story is very well known to us, DisneyPhiles (People who Love anything Disney.) Whether or not you are like me and are scared nuts about being dropped or not but enjoy the story, go and get this on VHS or DVD."
1,ot eve,"TI canhis is the worst movie, don't bother to even purchase it the actors & plot are BADBAD I wish I never bought the DVD I am unable to even give it away I am ashamed of the movie DONT BY IT"
3,It was okay,I was kind of disapointed with the moviecould have been lots betterbut the ride at Disney land California is FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!oh wellsuch is life
3,"Anthony Michaels review of ""The Tower of Terror""","I'd say that this movie was in between. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. The special effects were okay. The acting was fine, but it's story got kind of weak toward the end of the movie. Steve Guttenberg had done much better in some of his other films, as well. The one thing that could have been improved was the fact that the same thing kept repeating itself. ""You lied to me!"", later in the movie - ""You said you were going to do it, but you lied!"", then again - ""I'm a fake!"" Over and over. It would have been better had they not done that.ALSO WITH STEVE GUTTENBERGCocoon"
3,Whaaah?,I don't care how good this movie is. There's no way I would spend a hundred and four bucks on a movie I could tape off the Disney channel for free.
2,Tower of Terror?,"This movie isn't any where near as good as the ride of the same name at Disney in LA. I can only hope that Disney made the movie about the ride and not the ride about the movie, otherwise the ride would of been very boring!!If you want thrills, I suggest that you go visit the ride at Disney LA"
3,A fun ride,"Disney's ""Tower of Terror"" offers a background story to the thrill ride at Disneyland and Disney World that will add some punch to the experience for those who've yet to experience it. For those who've already been, it will be a reminder of the highs -- and stomach-churning lows -- of their visit.As a movie, it's a kid-friendly, not-too-scary thriller that features a young Kirsten Dunst (excellent, as usual), Steve Guttenberg in his lovable chump mode, stylish turns by the always-lovely Melora Hardin (of ""The Office"" and ""Monk"") and Scottish actor Alastair Duncan, and able support from an array of character actors. As ""Q,"" heir to the haunted hotel, Michael McShane steals every scene he's in.In short: an entertaining diversion boasting a suitably spooky atmosphere and convincing special effects, with just enough suspense and frights to give the kids some giggles, and a workmanlike story served by a cast that seems to be having fun."
4,Disney Movies,It's corny but I like it. If you like Disney Movies you may want to add this to your collection.
4,Simple & Easy To Use,"Well, while I did say ""east to use"" it does require a little practice to get the hang of having to move your mouth around the tube. And also to get the the words to sound intelligible. But to a large degree that also depends on the effect you use. I use my microKORG with my Banshee so its very easy to tweak the settings as I go to get the sound I'm looking for. Also as a little side note I will say this, if you turn the gain up on the Banshee you will get a very prominant hissing that leaks out of the tube. But if you play with the volume knobs on both the talkbox and the input device its really not a problem that can't be tamed."
4,Interesting story.,"It was a good story and kept my interest. Not quite what I expected, but well written."
3,"Best Shrew ever, poor recording","I wish I could give this a higher rating, for it is the best ""Shrew"" I've ever seen. Len Cariou's performance couldn't be better, and the inclusion of the Induction and material from ""A Shrew"" is delightful. If only the recording weren't so very bad. The Stratford, Ontario Festival needs to redo this from the original tapes onto DVD. Then, it would be a five-star effort."
5,Magellan Mapsend Streets CD For Map 330,"I am very pleased with MapSend Streets. It displays my location accurately as I navigate the streets of my home town. I can even type in an address and it will know the exact location just by street and address number. Of course there are bound to be a few errors in any large data base of streets, but I have not found any in my area as yet. It doesn't have restaurants or other destinations included, they are in the ... ""Streets and Destinations"" edition."
4,Good product at reasonable price,"I am puzzled about the negative reviews concerning this product. I find this software very useful and relatively accurate. The other option is a [price] built in color gps and maps in your car. Compare the prices and value added and you'll be very satisfied with this product.Living in the Chicago area, I get lost a lot. However, thanks to my Magellan gps and Mapsend Streets, I never found myself wondering around aimlessly. It may have even saved me from some serious harm a time or two.Good stuff. Buy it with confidence!"
3,Not a good starter book for beginners,This is a better book for an experianced user. For the experianced user it provides a number of good magick spells.
3,Not for people just starting out in the craft,"This book is ok, but not great. I wouldn't suggest buying it, but if a friend has it, borrow it. The book has some spells in there that no true witch would ever do. Its ok for reference, but I would not suggest it for anyone just starting out in the Craft. This book should be read by those who have experience."
3,Nice unit but several small problems.,Great features and a good price but several problems will require returning the unit. The disk cover opens while playing a movie causing a need to restart and find where you were. The processor occasionally locks up requiring removal of all power to reboot the system. The battery will go dead in less than 3 days if left connected to the (turned off) unit. The latch that holds the unit closed makes it very dificult to open. The audio amplifier is weak and would not be loud enough to hear on an airplane even using headphones so an external amplifier is needed. Hopefully these problems are just in my unit and replacement will solve the problems.
1,Apex is terrible to deal with!!!,"I bought one of these ~ 1 year ago. I never used the battery. In July I tried the battery and it wouldn't hold a charge. Apex gladly gave me an RMA # and I returned the battery. Now in Dec after 10-15 phone calls the off-shore ""customer service"" response is always the same. ""The battery is on back-order, we'll ship it in 7-10 days""This has gone on since July (it is now Dec!). I have sent emails, I get a canned response, sent faxes, no response. Don't buy Apex!!"
4,Dialectic of Freedom,"Required textbook -- tough reading, but I enjoyed it! Greene uses a lot of literary references which the majority of my classmates were unfamiliar with. This book almost requires a degree in English literature to understand what she's getting at."
1,Oh the Agony!,"She has valid things to say, but seems more intent on demonstrating her intellegence with grammatical gymnastics. I have to read this for class, and it has been an excruciating experience. Very disorganized thought, poorly edited."
1,Long winded and profoundly unfocused.,"After reading and then re-reading this book, I am impressed only by Ms. Greenes ability to ramble on for 134 pages without making a point."
4,Ausgezeichnete Film,"Considering its age, and the sheer fact of it's survival in spite of the Nazi's destruction of all copies they could find, it is an interesting and impressive piece. Since this was made close to the time that Weil and Brecht wrote the piece, I think it is closer to the rubrick than later versions. My only problem was that, as is often the case, the subtitles bore little or no resemblance to what was actually being sugn."
2,awkward but historically interesting,"Considering Brecht was very displeased with this film its no wonder it bears little resemblance to the stage version,flat performances ( including Lenya who must have been amazing on stage), the omission of half the score ,including solomon song, tango duet,and the lucy role altogether, the ending being changed,omitting the hanging and reprival, and poor subtitles make this a curious but ininspired production. even the time period is wrong,victoria became queen in 1832 not the 1890s! still as a film that set all of nazi germany into a flutter it has moments of great social commentary. no as many as the masterpiece stage production however."
3,.,"I have always liked the Murad products,and I was hoping I could find something that would help my 40ish year old face look younger, but unfortunately, I have discovered I am allergic to this one."
4,a patron saint of degeneracy,"""Comédia de Deus, A [God's Comedy]"" follows a cadaverous, laconic, and self righteous degenerate named Joo de Deus whose sensual universe revolves around the exotic ice creams he makes and the girls he seduces. His boss, a former prostitute, who knows his proclivities but depends on his unique and exotic ices for her business success, rescued him from the gutter to manage her shop. He, however, despises all official points of view, collects and annotates samples of pubic hair, and pursues ever-younger conquests, hovering over them like a vulture flapping its wings. At best the dark comedy endorses a kind of sainthood of perversity in a disjointed and hypocritical world; at worst it has no heart or meaning at all beyond defiance of all judgment."
2,Junk food extravaganza,"Like so many kids books, this one shows pancakes, suckers, bubble gum, taffy, little crackers, cake, ice cream, potato chips - repeatedly.We avoid commercial TV and its brainwashing effects on what we eat... Wwhat a disappointment when our favorite characters to advertise this junk to us - no thanks!"
2,"Predictable, bad acting","The movie gave away most of its plot, which makes it predictable and uninteresting. The actors are perhaps at best B-rated in term of acting abilities. Don't waste your time."
5,Everything That Creeps,I bought this book for my friend as a birthday gift. And the next day I bought another one for myself cuz the book is really fantastic! I wanna share it with my other friends who like creepy things. The details are so delicate that I could spend hours reading it. Highly recommend it!
5,top notch,"As far as art books go, it doesn't get any better than this. The cover alone is absolutely amazing! The art of Liz Mcrath stands in a class of it's own. This has got to be one of the coolest, most intense things you could ever lay on your coffee table."
4,Liz McGrath,"I have an affinity for hard cover art books. This book was very exciting to recieve. It's odd and strangly cute. I absolutely adore McCrath's work. This book is a great document of what she does. She as an artist I rate at 5 stars. The only reason I chose to give this book a 4 star review is because the close ups are not of great quailty. In fact many of them are grainy like a JPEG that has been enlarged too much. Despite this, it is still a great purchase."
2,Disappointed,"I don't know if the machine works well or not...I couldn't find a DVD it recognized to record on...It didn't accept an HP or a Maxell, both of which specs matched the requirements in the manual.I gave up after the Maxell and returned the machine,,,I replaced it with a less expensive Lite-on with the All Write system...I highly recommend a multi-format machine, They're a lot easier to use and less expensive to buy blank discs for."
3,good recorder,it works fine . but have to choose right type of dvd . just a few type dvd recordable is compatible with this dvd recorder .
5,Entertaining education in concepts and language,My several grandchildren have enjoyed this book as I bring it along on my visits. The size and construction are great for their small hands and the bright colors and animation make the learning process fun and appealing. It seems that most children today know at least one Spanish-speaking family and this is a great tool for bringing better understanding of two languages.
3,okay but there are better,"I bought this book for my 6-month-old daughter. We live in an area in which there are more people who speak Spanish than English, and I'm trying to expose her to the language early. She loves the bright colors, but I'm not sure how much she'll learn from the book. Each page has just one word on it, illustrated in pictures of cute animals. However, without repetition or contextualization in sentences, I doubt this will help her aquire very much Spanish. For now though, it's fun to see her stare at the bright colors."
5,opposites,Great for bilingual education. Children should be old enough to understand the concept of opposites.edconnectionsllc.com
3,"EDUCATIONAL, BUT........","Good quality, educational, but too short for the price. My 3 years old son already knows the opposites that are in this little and short book.It should be sold at a cheaper price."
5,Wow Great book!,"Bought this book after hearing a little about it, after I started reading I couldn't stop.I don't normally read war story's but this is much more, it's a life of a young man that I'm sure anyone can relate to.I'm sure a lot of us wish we were as bold and courageous as the dog handler that saw hell and learned how to deal with it.The story teaches of what life was like for many of our troops and what they went through.I laughed out loud at some points and was so sad at others I could actually feel the loss.Family, love, honor and respect, it's all sewn together in a wonderful way that will make you think for days after you finish the book!Great book I hope to see more from this author !Bob""J's b"""
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!,I order a regular comb from this seller and shipping charges weren't shown until after I paid and I was charged almost $9.00 shipping for an item that i purchased for under $1.50. And on top of that I received the wrong item item and I can't get my shipping cost back for their mistake. Worst transaction ever!!!!!!!!!!! And product looked cheap!
4,One Hundred Years of Cars!,"This is a pretty thorough view of cars since the beginning of the automotive industry. What I liked about the book was that it showed not only the cars but a lot of the advertisements in the the industry's ""golden age"" of the 1950's.With all the down-turns in the economy as of the writing of this review, and GM, Ford, and Chrysler, all in trouble, and the fact that the age of innocence is long gone, it is fun to get into this book every once in a while and look at cars when they had personality, when they didn't all look alike, and when the new model year in September was something exciting to look forward to.This is more of a ""memory book"" and it chronicles the emergence of the automobile in all its different shapes, sizes, and colors. If you are a 'car junkie' like me, you'll love it!"
2,Do not buy this book if you are just beginning Trigonometry.,"This book is good for one thing, a Quick Review. I suppose I can't blame CliffsNotes, since that is given in the title of the book. I bought this book when I was beginning to learn Trigonometry, along with another textbook. I found that a lot of the things the textbook went over was not even mentioned in this Quick Review book. If you have taken Trigonometry in the past and want to refresh some of the basic trigonometry concepts, then this book is for you. However, if you know nothing about Trigonometry and want to learn about it, this book will do nothing but CONFUSE you.Most people that will look into these books are people who want to learn the subject for their first time, so take my advice: instead of buying this book, save that money towards a better, complete basic trigonometry textbook."
1,Take another look,"This book seems to be pretty nice, until you start finding all the super horrible mistakes that are thrown in ever couple of pages. They are all do the this book not being edited, and make it a hassle to read as you have to second guess everything that is written. I got about half way done and the mistakes turned me off so bad I put the book away and don't intend to read from it again. This book could have been a real nice book but the mistakes are just too horrible to look over."
4,Gothic pshychedelic-trance?,"There's something about Lycia that sets is apart from the rest of Projekt's lineup (which is well-deserving in itself). This album, filled with stellar imagery (Lycia tend to have themes on their albums - Estrella means 'star'), is certainly one to be enjoyed at night. The best tracks are filled with brooding, trippy atmospherics, with Tara's voice blending in and out, making for one of those listening experiences after which you wonder why it went by so quickly, feeling like for a little while you were at a place just a bit more magical than this one, longing for more. Best enjoyed with a skylight, away from light pollution, in full view of the stars."
4,sharp blades,"These are nice and sharp blades, but I'm surprised by their durability. I was expecting more than 3 weeks, but that's about as much as I get out of these blades. I shave 3-4 times per week"
3,Decent Blades,"Merkur blades are decent, as each blade works differently for everyone I can't say they won't be the best for you. Good price, last 3-4 shaves"
2,Sub-par,"Yes, it removed hair from my face, so I can't give it one star. However, it felt like it was pulling each hair out rather than cutting. I only used these because I ran out of Feathers, and would rather go scruffy than use these blades again."
2,There are better,"I have been using a Merkur safety razor for about a year now. I have tried several different blades and I must say that these are horrible. Compared to Feather or Derby blades (my favorites) these seem too stiff and not nearly sharp enough. I have a sharp jawline and I must say these blades do not conform to it at all. Several strokes in different directions and techniques trying to get the blade to cut, only left my face sore and far from smooth. With the Feather and/or Derby blades I can easily cut through over a weeks growth with no irritation and at worst 1-2 nicks if I'm in a hurry. Spend the extra dollar and pick up some feather blades, or spend the same and grab a pack of quality Derby blades."
5,Awesome buy,"I purchased this brand because I bought the merker razor and it came with one sample, no nicks or cuts or anything to complain about. Awesome value!"
4,Gives a good shave,"These razors seemed to perform just as good as any others that I have tried. They may be a step up from some of the Lords that I have had, but I think the10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edgethat I had were still the best that I have used. Of course, as far as I know, it's all personal preference."
3,"May work for some, but not for me.","I find it hard to leave a review on any DE blade. But I will say that I had a pretty bad time shaving with blades, lots of irritation and tugging. Plenty of other similarly priced blades out there that are way more comfortable."
1,Disapoitment,"I purchased these blades because I have been unable to find good double edge razor blades in the stores. However, these wer no sharper than the drugstore brands I had been using.About 4 weeks ago I ordered a different brand of double edge blades: Schick/Wilkinson. They sent the wrong type of blade so I contacted them and they said they were mailing out the correct order. This was 2 weeks ago and I have not received the correct order. Several efforts to contact them have been futile. Thus, I remain a very disappointed Amazon user!"
3,Ok for beginner shavers...,"This was my first set of razor blades. I have sensitive skin and they caused me irritation if I went against the grain or they would pull the hairs leaving little blood dots. The blades also have to be switched every few (2-5) shaves. I switched to sharper Feather blades and problems went away, they also last longer (5-10) shaves."
4,Good product,"Easy to use and simple design. Overall I'm happy with the product. I didn't buy the feather blades that everyone raves about, but I will."
3,They work,"I used all 10 of these and played around with my technique. With some work I can get a good shave with them, but after only 3 shaves they were significantly duller than other cheaper blades such as the LORD Platinum. And if you can get 5 or more shaves from a FEATHER then that too is a better deal than these blades. They are worth experimenting with, but not the best blade out there."
4,Repeat User,"I have been using these for the past few years. I enjoy the shave they give. They provide just the right balance for my needs, not to aggressive."
3,Harsh and a little overpriced,"My first shave with this razor, and it felt very harsh. I have sensitive skin and this left me feeling raw. I always give a blade multiple shaves to see if it gets better, but usually know on the first pass if I like it or not. I've tried a lot of razors and I think there are better values out there for the price. The blade is very sharp (IMO not as sharp as a feather, which is not my go to), but left my skin irritated. I haven't cut myself in a while, but had a couple of nicks with this blade. Not a very forgiving blade. I use a Gillette 1962 Slim adjustable. First shave was on a #4 setting and will try to dial it back and see if it gets better. Every DE shaver has an opinion on what works well for them. IMO it wasn't an aggressive shave, but was a harsh blade on my skin. Just two passes today, WTG and XTG...2 hours later and still feeling a burn."
1,Merkur double-edged razor blades,"I really like my Merkur razors and am really enjoying ""shaving with a brush"" again. However, I am less than impressed with the Merkur blades. They pull and drag something fierce - I'm guessing they are just not very sharp. Maybe I just got a bad batch?Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor Blades- 3 Pack of 10 BladesI get much better results with the no-name blades that CVS sells and Wilkinson Sword sold by Wal-Mart. Either of these feel like there's no blade in the razor compared to the Merkurs and are much less expensive."
5,The Best Shave At Home ...,"Forget about those disposable five blades razors. This is just like what my Godfather used, and he knew how to shave. This blade is simple and it gives me the closest shave (every 3-day) without nicks, cuts, in-grown hair, or razor bumps. Hard to find though ..."
1,Inferior garbage,I've bought blades at Wal-Mart for less that were better. I own and love my Merkur Razor. Their blades are garbage. They tug at day old stubble because they are not sharp enough fresh out of the wrapper on the first use. If you need a good blade man up and buy Feather. It seems that the Germans are all about recycled steel and their knives and Razor blades show it. The best knives and Razor blades are coming out of Japan these days.
1,Go with Feather or Derby,"Way too expensive, bad QC, not the sharpest. At a $2.00 they'd be good, at the prices Merkur charges, its highway robbery!"
2,Mailing was too expensivde,"For a small object, I was charged $12.00 for shipping, which is way to expensive. I will never buy these again."
3,The later years.,"Twice I worked in ""THE YARD"".First was as an electrician aboard the USS Constelation.Due to sneezing rust from my lungs,I resigned from the job.One month later,she caught fire!My second job was MUCH later,in the 70's,assembling new French built New York City Subway cars.This lasted for about two years,until the contract was done.I expected a bit more from this book. :(("
1,THEY CAME BROKEN,"these glasses came in pieces, they were not packaged properly at all! Had to get credit and go to store to buy. Don't order online unless you want a bag of glass."
4,Amazon steps up,One of these four lovely wine glasses came broken and Amazon sent a new set as replacement without extra charge. That's why I'm a fan! Thank you Amazon.
3,"Beautiful, but quite fragile","I have owned 2 sets (8 glasses) of these wine glasses. I love the shape and feel. Unfortunately, 7 are now gone. I think they are more fragile than your average crystal wine glass."
1,Broken TWICE!,These glasses were for a gift and they arrived with 2 of the 4 glasses just shattered. Customer service was great & sent out another set right away. Two of THOSE 4 glasses were also broken. These glasses were not packed for shipping! I won't buy anything breakable from amazon again.
4,Cool Costume,Purchased this costume for my wife we were concerned about the size so she got the larger size and didn't need to. This costume runs big so it should be true to size when you order one. She thought it was quite comfy. Only problem was the horns which are not the best quality. They are stuffed but not sewn so the stuffing in the horns just hangs there in the holes and they dont stay errect very well. Other than that the costume was a big hit.
1,Game is Garbage!,"I tried out the demo, and I don't see how people can actually play this game, it is a waste of time, I don't even know why I demo'd it. It's garbage, save your money and your GB."
4,Not the best RTS You could buy...,"C&C3; is a very fun game, don't get me wrong. However, pretty much any RTS on a videogame system is bound to have control problems and C&C3; is no exception. This game is very fast paced for an RTS, and when there's a horde of bad guys attacking your base, you dont want to be fumbling around with a control stick trying to select your soldiers.For me anyway, this game is just to fast paced for an RTS, but usually awesome battle scenes and graphics make this game at least somwhat enjoyable. RENT IT if you just want some gamerscore points and BUY IT if you like RTS's."
3,Does not even compare with Halo Wars,"Graphics are average at best. Game controls are slightly awkward. I havent played this game more than 4 or 5 times since i bought it :)Bottom line: If your into RTS style games, then just buy Halo Wars."
3,Good start for XBOX 360 games,"-ve pts -1/ Take time to get used to joystick.2/ Gameplay is not well optimized for XBOX 360, gliches at big maps and big battles in skirmish.3/ Takes for EVER, EVER, EVER for loading and saving.+ve pts.1/ Game is as always fun for CnC fans."
5,Something for the hardcore gamers,If you like strategy then you should love this. You have to plan what to do and follow your plan. If you get cocky get ready to be handed you head. It made me glad to have bought my 360.
2,i suck.....,"i am a big fan of this type of strategy game, especially warcraft and starcraft. i even loved command and conquer generals. i guess i'm too slow or i suck or something, because i can't get through a certain level, even on EASY. would be fine, if it were a later level, but its not. this is like, the third level. tired of reloading my game, etc.. would rather go play backgammon or something....is this the new age of rts gaming? am i too old school for this sh#t? i love this genre, and if everything is going this direction, i am already tearing up. i like to spend time and think about my strategy before i attack or whatever. in this game, by the time i've worked out my strategy, i'm toast.i think i'll just go back to age of mythology for a while......"
1,Great Game but for the PC,Overall this is a great game. but it does play much better on the pc. easier to handle with a mouse. For the most part it doesn't get boring. Kanes wrath should make it even better. I have played Warcraft and Age of Empires (no unit limit) but this game beats them all. Command and conquer always have the best games with the best units.Online is crazy. people have way to much time on there hands. I stick with the computer and its just as fun. You actually win to.I give it 5/5 stars. its worth it especially with the price drop. STAY WITH THE PC!PS. i cant change the star ratings. (stupid computer)
4,Just WOW,ProsGraphics are great compared to what I was used to with Yuris Revenge on PC.Controls on xbox aren't that hard and or pretty well implemented into the game playThis game is extremely hard on medium but that just makes it a lot better and will make you put more hours in the game.negativeThe load time kinda sucks but its not that big of a deal.It sometimes acts like it cannot connect to xbox live.
1,I really hate this game,"I would very much like to agree with ""friend in usa"" The game was quite fun until GDI mission just after unlocking NOD campaign (keep in mind GDI is the INTRO campaign)...then infuriatingly impossible. Why is this game so hard even on easy mode. I am not even joking. I tried and reset this mission at least 20 times in the span of 3 or 4 days. I was very close at times to ripping this game out and smashing it against the wall. Then I remembered how much I paid for it and could do nothing but sigh(Trying to play this game on a big screen tv is also near impossible. If you have a sniper unit or missile unit, good luck trying to find them). I am not an RTS noob either. I have played just about everything from Civilization to Starcraft 2. Seriously, is it just me or is anyone else getting tired of buying games only to run smack in to a brick wall halfway through them."
4,"Not a bad game at all,","I would prefer the pc version, but i refuse to install any game with a DRM hiding in it."
1,Complete waste of time!,"I didn't gain anything of value from this book. The personality test was so off-base that the description of my ""type"" was just about the opposite of who I am. Therefore the advice for each type was not only simplistic - it was useless. Most of the work suggestions are irrelevant to the self-employed who aren't part of an organization or anyone who doesn't have co-workers. And the time-management advice was just a rehash of some of the principles from other books, such as Stephen Covey's. This book might be valuable to people who've never taken a step toward clarifying priorities or time management, and who work in an organization in which they're continually negotiating work issues with others, but I didn't gain any insight whatsoever from it, and found it a complete waste of time."
4,Beautiful Creations,"This soft cover is most informative, reasonably priced, and quite clear. My nine-year-old son bought it and he understands the directions with only limited asistance from me, and has made two of Mr. Arnstein's beautiful, original creations. I highly recommend it for any lover of geometry and origami."
5,Awesome edition,"Used this edition with High School students. Not only was this accessible for them, but they loved it. It inspired all sorts of amazing conversations. GET IT and READ IT."
1,Unpalatable Translation,"I wanted to read Gilgamesh and ordered this edition randomly. I read it and did not enjoy it at all. Dull, unexciting, repetitive, unmemorable.A few years later I was talking to a lit. professor who was surprised I didn't enjoy Gilgamesh. He suggested that that what I'd read might have been a flat translation. He was right. I read what he recommended:Gilgamesh: A New English Version by Stephen MitchellandGilgamesh by John Gardner and John MaierThese two translations were very enjoyable and read like true epics. Don't order this edition and, if you do, don't base your opinion of the work on this translation alone."
4,Penguin Epics (review),"This is a review ofThe Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Epics)published 2006. This is a prose translation by N.K. Sandars, which was first published in Penguin's 1960 edition of Gilgamesh, re-printed here sans the book-length editors introduction. Just the meat, no potatoes or desert. It took me about 2 hours to read as an average reader, was clear and easy to understand. The book is physically tiny, 4x8 inches and a quarter-inch thick, it would disappear on a book shelf.I purchased this at the same time asThe Buried Book: The Loss and Rediscovery of the Great Epic of Gilgamesh, however I wished I had waited, as 'Buried Book' has a good overview of more recent translations available. However I am not disappointed as Sandard's translation is good and easy and understandable - it may not be scholarly level, but perfectly acceptable for most readers who just want to read the epic and enjoy it."
3,It's not amazing for the price,"It's okay, but a bit pricy for such a small simple toy. Our son is really into buses (Tayo the Little Bus) but he never played with it much."
3,"Fun, but not durable","This bus is a good match for the Plan Toys bus station that comes in the City Transportation pack. My son loves trucks and seems to enjoy this bus as well. The rubber tires are a nice touch, as the bus rolls quietly and smoothly.My only complaint is that the quality was less than expected. The paint has already started to wear off and the rubber tires are not secured to the wheels, so they can be pulled off. My son doesn't play with it everyday and is relatively gentle with his toys, so the paint loss is quite surprising. At $10+ for a small, low detail bus, I expected a toy that would last an entire childhood. Right now, I just hope it lasts until his next birthday."
2,Chipping paint,"Unlike the yellow school bus, this bus quickly starts chipping paint. had i known that i wouldn't have gotten it. I don't care how non-toxic the paint is, it still isn't good for my child to be digesting."
3,Plan Dissapoints!!! :(,"I love plan toys and have many from the plan city series, but the Plan City Bus has not held up. The first day we had the bus the white paint began to crack and chip. Most of the other plan vehicles are stained and have not had this problem. The City Bus is now only a month and a half old and looks like its 20 years old. If it wasn't for the fact that the paint is safe I would have had to take this away from my son already."
1,The definitive authority?,"Don,How are you the definitive authority on Solution Selling? Sales Performance International ( [...]) owns the Solution Selling suite of intellectual property and has published books that outline this topic for individual sellers, sales managers, and solution-centric organizations. Perhaps you have some good ideas, but SPI has been doing this for 20+ years."
1,Worst ever,"This book is certainly the worst publication I have ever encountered. It's not a historical atlas at all; it's fraud. Which sorely disappointed me. I have been searching for a historical atlas of India for many years. Despite the fact that Indian history is one of the most fascinating, India, alas, is the only important part of the inhabited world for which there is no historical atlas. I think the reason for this is simply that there is too much uncertainty among serious scholars about when the numerous cultural and political units started and ended, and even more uncertainty about where to draw the borders. So what kind of people would be drawn to an attempt to create a coherent historical atlas of India? Either the very best historians making their very best guesses -- or the most despicable sort of con artist trying to make a quick buck. So now we've had the latter. Let's hope we'll soon have the former."

1,Waste of my money,"I have been using this about 1 month. I use the body cream as well. It smells chemical like, and I am not seeing any results at this point. Very expensive, I could spend $8.00 at the drug store for a product that does the same...."
4,Tone serum,It works but you have to keep it going forever. If you stop everything comes back to what is was before like every other beauty regimen. Make sure to drink lots of water to help ur body eliminate toxins from celullite. Would recomend if you can commit to a twice a day beauty regimen.
5,Excellent Gift Set,"I got this for a friend for Christmas - can't believe I received it within 2 weeks (as it came from France and had to get to San Francisco). Beautiful set & really packaged well. If they don't like it, I'll take it. Pen & pencil are nicely weighted and felt very comfortable in my hand. I was glad I went with this set based on the previous reviews."
4,A Remarkable Story,"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Matthew 6:33Disregarded by her mother, rejected by her first love, Leah longs to escape Nashville. In desperation, she marries a man she does not love thus becoming entrapped in a life of pretense. As she spirals downward toward rock bottom, she holds fast to the one constant force in her life, God. Richard Brian Botelho cleverly draws the reader along as Leah searches for her purpose. This remarkable story serves as a wake-up call to all believers. In our futile attempts to find happiness from people and places, we often overlook the path that God has already provided.--- reviewed by Tyora Moody for Christian Bookshelf"
5,Great New Book!,"Finally, I found a novel that enriches me and an understanding of life. Leah's Way is so good I think it might be the best novel I've ever come across. It's a little gem. The story is so captivating it literally flew by. The descriptions of scenery and characters are outstanding. And the characters live! It was over before I knew it. Leah is an inspiration to us all. Get the book. And give it to everyone you know. I can't wait to read the next novel by this author."
5,Leah's Way Review,"Rick Botelho writes a compelling story about a deeply religious Southern woman's search for love and meaning. Her early experience of a love lost sets in motion bad choices which leave her unfulfilled.Yet her profound love and devotion to God keeps her going as she endures the consequences of her human fralities. The author's ability to draw you into her character; to feel her pain, yet still hope, makes for a truly inspirational story. A MUST READ!"
5,Awesome Rock,"The follow up Album to The Return brings new songs, more adventures and something that you'll find yourself taking on road trips and sharing with your friends. The copy that I have has a bonus DVD, but I don't see that listed on the description here and may have been a limited release. The DVD is from one of 800's famous Halloween shows and takes you directly into the action of what it's like to see this quartet live. I highly recommend picking up a copy of Rise Again."
5,Great Pendant,I got this pendant along with the earrings. It has great sparkle and takes on the color of whatever you are wearing. I do recommend buying the matching earrings because it is a great pair.
5,This is beautiful,I just love this pendant and have had a lot of compliments on it. The crystal is absolutely beautiful and catches the light wonderfully.
2,Black and Decker,"The sweep and collect is an interesting idea. Several sweeps over crumbs were necessary to pick them up. The sweep and collect couldn't pick up small pieces of paper. It is a little bottom heavy but easy to set up. I would want it in my kitchen or nearby, but finding a place proved difficult since there is no closet where I could hang it up as is recommended. The idea is good, but the price is too much for a device that is out-performed by other products on the market."
3,Needs more power,"Although in theory this product should work well, there isn't a lot of suction on the vacuum part of the appliance. I purchased it as I have a dog that sheds a lot. I sweep every day. The broom works well, but the vacuum part can't handle the dog hair. The dog hair gets wrapped around the beater bar and then it clogs up."
1,Sweep and Collect Broom,"I sent it back. I could not figure out the directions, when I put it together, like I thought it should be, I could not get it to work. I don't have much patience and just didn't have to time to mess with it."
2,Disappointed,I REALLY DO NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT - IT IS NOT QUICK AND USER FRIENDLY -- DO LOVE THE BISSELL GO VAC --
3,"Fun, in a crass, predictable way","I bought this and the two other books at the Navy exchange in San Diego's Balboa Naval Hospital in March of '89, as I began the third year of my first tour of duty. I've always enjoyed post apocalyptic stories, Damnation Alley, Mad Max and The Guardians being among the best. Silver Wings & Leather Jackets and its sequels are irreverant, highly implausible, stories of a young man living in post apocalyptic America on an 'air force' base when his father dies attempting to shoot downhis traitor uncle. From there, our hero gets thrown out of the academy, discovers a Marine weapons merchant who holds his legacy, and he begins his series long infatuation with a woman who views him as some form of cockroach. Its pure mind candy, but its FUN. Just imagine Beavis and Butthead writing, and you get the picture."
2,i reakky didn't care for it. it looked better on TV,it looked a whole lot better on TV when i saw it. if my parents didnt get rid of the box i would have returned it
1,ZERO stars for ZERO Gravity,"We had a very disappointed boy on Christmas Day. I was dubious about this product so I had a back up r/c gift on hand, thank goodness.The zero gravity r/c hummer is a piece of junk. We followed the charging and operating instructions to a T, and it is just an awful, overpriced toy. It does not move AT ALL on even low pile carpet. It did not climb our walls (there is a makeshift ramp included if your walls have baseboards) AT ALL. I took it back the very next day, as I am sure many will be doing. Shame on Air Hogs for selling this junk to kids. Come to think of it, I have never had an air hogs product that worked..."
1,Not Worth the Trouble,Read all the reviews. Most will say this R/C is not worth the trouble...and it isn't. I also heard that there was going to be a massive recall on all of them. Definitely not worth all the money spent on it.
1,For Kids?,"I thought this toy was a joke! So it can climb walls. But the outside of the box fails to tell you that you can only use it indoors, not on carpet, only on a flat surface, and that if you have molding from your floor to your wall, it doesn't work either. When we purchased this for our son we assumed that you could use it like most R/C vehicles PLUS it would climb walls. Not that climbing walls is the ONLY thing it would do. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the motor is extremely loud for other small children in the house. For kids, this toy will be cool for about 2 mintues until they realize they can only use it under STRICT circumstances. We returned it the next day!"
4,Incredible fun,"Santa just brought this to my six year old son and it is incredible! I read several reviews prior to buying this toy and was encouraged by mostly positive reviews. Most reviews had this car working under very strict conditions; however, our walls are painted panelling and the car works great! I hope everyone else has as much success! This car was a hit with the whole family, the parents and grandparents but especially with the kids!"
1,A Lesson Learned,"All parents know that kids want everything they see on TV. I have to praise this Zero Gravity gadget for breaking my son of that habit. He has learned early that commercials embellish the truth.We tried every wall in our house. If we helped it get on the wall it would climb a little bit. Sadly it only worked on one floor of our house. It would not work on any carpet, tho they are all low pile. It would not work on the playroom vinal. It would work on the kithen floor, but did not make it over the baseboard. THey are generous enough to give you a card board ramp, that helps alittle as long as you tape it into place frequently.This item simply does not work as advertised. I am sure there are people who have a home with exactly the right conditions, ours was not one of them. Since we tried this item in a total of 6 rooms with a variety of floor and wall surfaces I can not imagine the home suitable for this product are in the majority."
1,DONT DISAPOINT YOUR CHILD WITH THIS ONE!,"THIS IS A TERRIBLE TOY! IT NEEDS A 4 HOUR CHARGE TO RUN FOR 15 MINUTES - IT CANNOT CLIMB ANY WALL ON ITS OWN (YOU MUST PLACE IT ON THE WALL). IT'S JUST NO FUN. I AM SORRY FOR ALL THE KIDS THAT HAVE THIS AT THE TOP OF THEIR CHRISTMAS LIST - THEY WILL OPEN IT UP, WAIT HOURS TO PLAY WITH IT AND THEN BE SO DISAPPOINTED!"
4,Good rural textbook,"I like this book. It is an introduction to rural medicine and as such I felt like it was cursory in many areas, however I love the attempt at trying to organize rural medicine into an academic subject. Things that I would like to see in the next edition:1. A solid chapter on telemedicine, research for and against, and the economic struggles faced in its use and installation, as well as a breakdown of how much it costs to get a system up and running.2. A chapter on community Asset Mapping, the do's and don't's of community organizing. Ethnographic techniques for the physician interested in program development.3. Alternative economic models that have worked in rural communities. Basically sustainable small business models.4. The role of research in small towns and the important statistics to measure beyond morbidity and mortality.There were a few others but these are the ones that stuck out."
2,atrocious quality,This is a great movie but the picture quality is atrocious and the running time is only 85min not the 105min advertised!
2,Ripoff,"A shameless Italian-made ripoff of The Sting, even down to the pseudo-ragtime music. As other reviewers have mentioned, the colors in the transfer to DVD are terrible. Really only for those who are perversely interested in watching the downward spiral of Anthony Quinn's post-1960s career."
3,Good iif you already know what your doing,"This book gives good examples of quantum problems and teachs the material in an easy to learn format. I have recommended it to many of my peers and they all like it.However, I recommend it on one warning... Make sure you know you algebra and basic quantum princples before hand. There are too many typos in this book. Close to one on every page. I saw my first few errors and spent too much time trying to figure out why they did something. Then you have to dismiss it as a typo.Good as a suppliment to David Griffiths, but i suggest get 2 other books and read away."
3,Heavy Mathematics,"The cover of the book makes it look like a ""dummies"" book. I'm sure it's a great book for someone pursuing the field. Note that heavy mathematics begins in the first paragraph of the first page, and continues throughout. It is not a book for reading, but one for solving equations."
2,So Many Mistakes!,"This book is so full of mistakes, it's hard to follow. The examples skip over a lot of the math, occasionally making it difficult to figure out how they got from point A to point B. This is made even worse by the fact that the answer they end up with might be full of typos. They do stupid stuff like using + instead of = or writing the wrong exponent on a variable, but they also skrew up important equations from time to time. I'm wasting a lot of time in my reading of this text trying to figure out when and where the book went wrong. I would definitely NOT recommend this text."
1,Do not waste your time.,As commented on by many reviewers there are numerous typos and errors in the math. The author presents some ideas very clearly. It is a shame that the learning is then sabotaged by these errors. A new edition is clearly needed and the first edition should be withdrawn. Addendum: I just found a notice that a new edition is due in January of 2013.
2,"Maybe good, maybe not","This book has a lot of errors in chapters 1, 2 and 3. But, in general, its a good book. Only this, 'good'."
3,Better than my prof! But the book does have many typos...,"I got more out of this book than from two semesters of university-level quantum. The books does needs some serious editing, however--there are quite a number of typos throughout--but it's still a great resource, and perfect for someone (like myself) looking for a quantum refresher."
3,"Simple to understand, but WAY too many mistakes","If this book didn't have LITERALLY at least one mistake on every page, I'd give it 5 stars. As it is, I have to spend half my time correcting the book. You should see how many things I've crossed out in mine. And the mistakes aren't just using p instead of rho (although there are plenty of those). Some fundamental equations that you need to know are given incorrectly. I'm only about 3 chapters through, but I can tell you that one of the answers to a problem in the Chapter 2 quiz is just plain wrong. (Number 7 - While dp/dt does equal 0, j(x,t) does not) You MUST have a strong grasp of physics and diffy q's to be able to get through this book. I'm giving it 3 stars as opposed to less because I find that I actually do end up with a good grasp of the material I just read, so it seems to be working."
4,good introduction but loaded with typos!,"I went through this book twice and found it very helpful in getting a basic familiarity with elementary quantum mechanics. Its strong point is the detailed exposition of the calculations which enables even people without a lot of math background to master and understand the material. The main problem is innumerable typos, which paradoxically are a kind of learning experience because they force you to go through each calculation in detail to correct the mistakes. But really, it's a shame that so little effort was made at proofreading before the book was published. The reader deserves better."
4,Truely Demystified,I think the book does a good job on explaining this very difficult subject. Good examples that actually follow a logical order that will be found in many text books. Would have a five star if it had a better review on linear algebra.
2,Quantum Mechanics Mystified Only Slightly Further,"The first time I read this book, I was shocked at the amount of mathematics without accompanying explanations. A person of college-level education is sure to know what an ""outer product"" is, but would it really have hurt to include a quick analogy or two to help the inexperienced mathematician get a grasp of the concept? Not only that, I noticed two glaring errors and one outright omission. Overall, not reccomended for anyone, especially the newbie to quantum mechanics."
1,Poor manufacturing,"We were excited about this product, it seemed like a great value, both a hitting T and batting practice for the price of just a hitting T, but were disappointed in the product. The first one arrived damaged (wouldn't hold water in base due to a small crack), so we ordered a replacement thinking it was just a manufacturing defect. The second broke (also in the base) with the first use by our 3 year old son, a huge double crack inside the base that gushed the water out (which, of course, it just falls over if there is no heavy water base). We returned it, and requested a refund (I love Amazon's easy returns!), won't be ordering from this manufacturer again! Instead, we will order a standard T, we're just disappointed this didn't work out: great idea, needs manufacturing work."
4,Pro performance hit a way,"Like this set and reasonably priced. sturdy and works fine. bought for 2 1/2 year old grandson who is very tall so we needed this taller type tee. kind of wish the bat was a little ""fatter"" though. overall a good buy. he prefers to hit a loose ball off the top for now, just happy to connect lol he will be more interested in improving his swing with the attached ball later."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the way the product works. It really isn't really good for a t-ball player. Older children have difficulty hitting the ball because it comes around too close to the pole. Additionally, when they hit either the pole often fell over, despite filling the base with water."
4,Great for 3yr old!!,"My grandson plays with the hit a way in our family room and really enjoys it! His hand eye coordination is rapidly improving, and he can practice right handed and left handed. i would recommend this highly."
5,Great DVD,Mari Windsor has great pilates videos. I like this one because you don't need a band or the sculpting circle required for some of her other videos. You can do it anywhere.
5,Lovely and informative,"I love old houses and history and bought two copies of this book for my brother-in-law and myself. By no means a complete directory of still-standing Southern mansions, the book includes pictures and informative descriptions of mostly pre-Civil War homes with historical significance. The book will serve as my guide for planning vacations to see these old homes and their amazing architecture."
4,one of the classic series among all,"The Minnesota Twins had last won the series in 1987. In 1991 they return with their star Kirby Puckett and beat a tough Atlanta team that was just starting to dominate the National League, The series had its ebb and flow with one team looking like the winner and then the other. But Puckett and the Twins prevailed in the end. ESPN rated this the greatest World Series ever. I don't agree with that but I will admit it was packed with excitement."
3,"The content is gripping, though falling short of it's name","The content of this book is such, that sometimes it is hard to believe that today such facts are dismissed so easily. The existence of Pluto was known with much precision before it's ""discovery"" and an old spanish copy of a map of antartica long before it's discovery are just the beginning of this books revalations. The reader must have an open mind, but make sure you follow up on some of it so you know for yourself just what you believe so as not to be too niave."
2,A real snoozer,"There are maybe 3 or 4 good tracks on this cd. The rest all sounds wish washy. There is no structure to most of thesongs and the muscianship is quite mediocre. The vocals however, are intriguing, soft, and emotional. You just wish it would reach some sort of peak, but the songs just never take off. Amazingly enough I will write this same review for Please Send Help. This project could really take off with a full band to accompany Plaster's ability as a songwriter/singer/guitar player. Save your self some cash and purchase this from projekt's website for only $[a bit o money]. It's really how much this album should be regularly."
5,Light hearted teaching for the whole family,"I bought it because of Disney, Tony Danza, and Noah. I keep it, and wish I could find a DVD version, because, the entire family (grandparents through grandchildren) enjoys it over and over again.Through a fun story line, it teaches enduring principles of faith, family dynamics, loss, processing grief, ethics in the work place, personal responsibility and growth, social dynamics, love, and forgiveness."
4,A Great Modern Day Version Of The Biblical Tale!,"I saw this movie a long time ago on T.V., so when it was released on video, I had to have it! Although this movie is called ""Noah"", It's not about him. It's about Norman Waters, a widower with three boys. Hes a construction worker who cheats people out of their money. He's the last person you would have expected God to act through, but God sends a messanger to tell Norman to build an arc using the same blue prints Noah used so many years ago. It takes him a while to realise that there really is a flood comeing and that he does need to build the arc. As he falls in love with the owner of the local pet shop, and starts being the father his children need, the flood comes. Will he be selfish enough to leave everyone else to die, or is he a changed man? Tony Danza gives an outstanding performance as Norman and you are sure to love this movie! This price is great and the video comes in a clamshell case so you can keep it for years to come!"
2,Noah,"Well, what can I say? I love Tony Danza and all, but I really didn't think that highly of this movie. Mostly for religious reasons. He was a neglectful father, he didn't accept the offer, God tried to punish him for not taking the job, he was not approached by God, but by a mysterious stranger. His son wants the ark destroyed, and all he's interested in is himself. No where in the bible does it say anything about all those things. God's word is the truth, and this movie turned it in to almost a complete lie. I only watched this movie half way through, so I give it thumbs down."
5,Literally the Best of the Corrs,"If you love the Corrs and their music then you will love this book. Anyone who calls themself a Corrs fan, this is a must have.The photograph is great and is gives you a better understanding of the Corrs really are."
1,God awful,"It is an embarrassment to social psychology to call this a textbook. The grammar mistakes, horrible sentence structure, and redundancy in this textbook are ridiculous. It felt like I was reading on a third grade level. Pick another textbook!!"
3,Gypsy Halflings and Chicken-Elves.,"In a strange coincidence two days after I received this tome, I wound up in a panel where Skip Williams explained that one reason none of the Player's Handbook races were +1 ECL was that they had to be familiar to the fans.I'm not sure if that was the same Skip Williams who wrote about the gypsy halflings in this book or not. I do know I wasn't as happy with this one as I was with Races of Stone. The new race, the Raptorans, seems unimaginative and oddly named. They're flying elves, not hawkmen or dinosaurs as ""raptor"" might have led you to believe. Well, actually, most of them are gliding elves, with flight more like chickens than hawks except for their most powerful members.If you are a completist/collector, like I am, then you'll buy this book. If you aren't, you should borrow it from the me in your group and use some of the interesting stuff while ignoring the rest (which, in my opinion, is most of it)."
3,Good but not great,"I found the first chapter regarding elves to be pretty much what was expected, good but not great. The next chapter on halflings was a disappointment. Maybe I am too old and set in my ways, I grew up with the lord of the rings and AD&D in the 80's and 90's. I like my hobbits... sorry, halflings tolkien -ified. This version of the halfling as a nomadic constantly traveling wanderer was not to my liking. The rest of the book was quite good and impressed me over earlier entries in the race sourcebooks.Overall I would give the first section on elves 3 stars, the halfling section 1 star, and the last chapters on the miscellaneous 'odds and ends' 5 stars ...overall, book as a whole 3 stars."
4,Handy refrence even beyond rpgs,"I did enjoy reading this book about elves, catfolk and halfings. You can of course keep the raptorians. Fluff there. I also enjoyed the listing of the various deities and the indepth culture of halfings and elves. Very intersting stuff that can be used even beyond the rpg setting, say for a fantasy writer or whatever. The writing was thoughtful and detailed and the artwork was well supporting the text. If you play elves and halfings and are intregued by the 'thundercat's as a a race then this book is highly suggested."
3,It works on some levels,"I'm a recent Halfling convert, so I didn't like what they did to Halflings by basiclly turning them into Kender Gypsies. Whatever! What it does do is help to explain how the wild races live freely and differently than those city bound folk. Good selection of prestige classes and new feats."
4,Fun Show,I love this show. It is light and fun with a lot of heart. I'm looking forward to next season!
5,Amazing!,I thought the series couldn't get any better but season 4 it phenominal. There are many unpredictable twists throughout the season that you never see coming and it keeps you wanting to watch more and more!
2,Decreasing in Quality,"My partner and I really enjoyed the first few seasons of Drop Dead Diva. It was a fun, original take on switching lives with someone and figuring out who you are. However, the quality of the show has really declined with this fourth season. Too many inexplicably random courtroom stories for my taste."
5,What a refreshing change of pace!!!!,"There are so many series on television with similar themes, but Drop Dead Diva is the bomb!!!! Characters are incredible and familiar to those we know in our own lives. The writers of this series are beyond brilliant! The sub-stories are on key and sure to attract a substantial following. The guest stars fit right in and the cast was very well cast. Will continue to watch this series for as long as they have it on!!! Join me! You won't be disappointed."
5,Fun and surprising,"Comedy with some light underlaying drama, good lines, and chemistry between the actors. It's fun and evolves with lots of elements of surprise to keep us watching. Considering the predictability of many sitcoms, it's refreshing to find one that we can't really tell where it's going."
4,"Fun show, great video from Amazon",The start of the fourth season looks like it will be as fun as the others! As usual the picture/sound quality from amazon is great. I would definitely recommend this service over other streaming video services. Just wish each episode was a little cheaper.
2,Has it's moments...,My personal opinion in season 4 dropping fred and the ongoing false hope of Grayson and Jane leads to a failing series.
1,Not closed captioned.,Waste of time since not closed captioned. Wonder if the others for this season are but dont want to spend the money and find out not.
4,Love the Diva,Great show. Just wish the star didn't keep gaining weight.She is very talented and I really want her and Owen to get married!
5,Love the Diva!,"I absolutely love Drop Dead Diva! It always makes me laugh, sometimes makes me tear up but it never fails to entertain me. My work schedule and resulting busy weekends mean that I rarely have the chance to watch shows as they air, so I record everything and watch when I can. This episode of Diva (Road Trip) came in the middle of a bad thunderstorm which knocked out the satellite. I was SO upset! Then I recalled that I'd previously found a missed episode of CSI Miami (yes, I miss Horatio)and decided to check it out. And THERE SHE WAS! The episode did not disappoint and I am very thankful that Amazon gave me a way not to miss one of my all-time favorite shows. Thanks all the way around!dc"
5,Heart-stirring,"I wouldn't watch this episode before watching the rest of season 3 and season 4 leading up to it... if you love Jane and Owen, this episode will make you cry."
3,okay show,"It was okay, it's something you can watch to kill time or if you have nothing better to do at that particular moment"
5,drop dead diva,i love drop dead diva because it it is serious but still fun and funny. i like the fact that she's an adult but yet this total girly girl.
4,great show,"great show... i think the earlier seasons were better, but its still a great watch..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
5,MUST SEE!,I love Drop Dead Diva!!! This season is SOOOOO addicting. So glad I could buy the season for $10! :)
4,The wedding,Love the show - not sure what direction this will take. We will just have to wait and see when it returns
5,life-changing song,"The song Mercy Now is life-changing. It's as beautiful as anything I've ever heard, and full of mercy. What a miracle of a song."
5,Mary on Air America Radio,"I'm streaming ""The Laura Flanders Show"" on Air America Radio. Laura is interviewing Mary Gauthier, who is also playing some songs. She is a wonderful spirit. Great music. I'm definitely buying this."
3,Dark Mary,"I hear Mary Gauthier frequently on a web radio station which I listen to. The few songs that the station plays are certainly enjoyable, in fact, they are the reason that I purchased the CD. Many of the other cuts on the disc are not quite my style of music. She does have a good voice and with the right music, has nowhere to go but up!"
1,Different,Just went to the store and found this. Can't imagine anybody could listen to the cd more than once. It sounds like my cat's standing on it!!!
1,"Pretentious, Posturing Songs and Singing","I bought this c.d. based on reviews in Amazon. I am very disappointed by the c.d., but not at all surprised by how truly mediocre it is. The songs are self-absorbed and do not in any way transcend their pretentious pessism and self-pity. I dislike the twangy voice, which she could discard and greatly improve her singing, if not her songs.That so many people really dig this singer is a very, very sad commentary on the listeners ability to discriminate between genuine worth and bogus pretensions. Comparing her to John Prine is disgraceful--he has written his share of poor songs, but he has also written quite a few good to excellent ones.By the way, too many people get turned on by what they consider to be poetry in songs. Please... Lyrics are not poetry, and calling them poetic degrades poetry as well as songs. If you want poetic, read poetry. Also, if you want a first-class c.d. buy (or steal) Mindy Smith's Long Island Shores."
5,Sing about what you know,"Those were Mary's words in an interview on her writing process. And that she does. Her songs reflect the life she knew well and gives it a deep, merciful kiss of recognition and retrospective sorrow. If this is your first Mary Gauthier album, take a step back into Filth and Fire, also. You won't be disappointed, because she never does disappoint."
5,Amazing,"Exactly what I wanted to say has already been said: ""I have to give Bob Dylan and his XM Satellite Radio show a big Thank You for leading me to Mary Gauthier. On Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour which focused on booze, he played ""I Drink"" from Mercy Now. I was sold. There's not much more to say than has already been said. Great songs, great voice, great CD.""All I will add is she must be amazing in a live performance!!"
1,Out of date.,"This book is unfortunately, out of date. New technologies are available that are not discussed. What there is is OK."
1,Brain Washing,"I went to India with Teen Mania, a Ron Luce organization, and I honestly believe that I was brain washed. I still feel awful about that period in my life."
5,A recommended 7-year Sunday School curriculum,"When Dr. Wiersbe was the pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Covington, KY (Cincinnati)he expanded a curriculum started by his predecessor, and as a result a 7-year Sunday School curriculum. I have been in churches that purchased 2 volumne set of 3-ring binders for both the Old and New Testaments. Each week the Sunday School teachers met together and were taught the lesson; and, they in turn did their own personal study and preparation for the lesson. Wiersbe has a scholar's mind and a pastor's heart and his down-to-earth appeal is historic. Minister's know him as the ""pastor's pastor."" While space does not permit touching on problem passages, whether one uses the book for personal study, a teaching outline, they can get a thorough survey of the Bible from a dispensational point of view."
2,Doesn't work well on Kindle,"This book, Nelson's Quick Reference Chapter-by-Chapter Bible Commentary [Kindle Edition], is the exact same text asWith the Word: The Chapter-by-Chapter Bible Handbook- Warren Wiersbe. But the ""Nelson's Quick Reference"" doesn't work well on Kindle. It is very slow, doesn't have a Table of Context that can be clicked on to get to a specific chapter of the bible, but ""With the Word"" works great. So if you want this book get the ""With the Word"" version and it'll run great on your Kindle.I am giving the Kindle edition only 2 stars but the book itself is wonderful as a devotional commentary that deserves 5 stars. It gives a break down of every chapter in the bible that is both educational and applicational."
4,Purchase of Bible Commentary,Smaller than relized when ordering but once got it I really like it's size. Very satisfied with purchase
3,Not What I Expected,"I was looking for a book that would break-down the scriptures, say what the scripture mean in layman terms. This book, ""to me"" is more like footnotes; that gives the authors insight on some of the verses. The author elaborated on Luke4:31-44. He stated ""we may not have the power to heal, but we can comfort and assist those who are needy.""But in the Holy Bible it says; ""...they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."" Mark16:18""Is any sick among you? ...the prayer of faith shall save the sick."" James5:14-15.This book was not what I was looking for, I can still use it; but I'm looking for a book that will break-down the scriptures."
5,Handy Tool,I use this most every morning during my prayer/Bible study time. Warren Wiersbe is very insightful and has good presentation.
4,A Good Tool,I like it Real Fast for Me I Get A Quick Understanding Then I Move Into My Big Commentrys Thanks !
3,not great,"I found this reference book to contain too much advice and not enough scholarship. It is chock full of admonishments, but scant on scholastic depth. I didn't learn much new, and I prefer to let that "" small voice"" within my heart lead me to the interpretation that works for me."
5,Great purchase!,Looked for this book everywhere locally and could not find it. Received it well in advance of the holiday and in perfect condition. Would definitely use this vendor again.
4,Great reference tool,"This is a great handy reference. It covers each book of the Bible briefly, but succinctly."
2,Unsatisfying,"I started this book with high hopes and enjoyed the first quarter of it, after which my opinion of the book got progressively worse until I finished it, thoroughly displeased.The constant jumping between characters and times simply doesn't give one a chance to get attached or emotionally invested in the book. I would rather read each era as a different book. Rape is used as a plot device too frequently. I believe that there are some historical inaccuracies in the book.It isn't boring and it is interesting to read because it is original and different, but I didn't enjoy it and would not read it again. 2.5/5."
4,Wonderful read,"Next to Incarnations of Immortality, this is Piers Anthony's best work. The research seems accurate, and it is clear that Mr. Anthony took this research in mind as he wrote the stories in this book. I found myself interested in the first two stories, that happened millions of years ago.My beef is Blaze and Ember's long separation, and their instant knowledge of their past lives when they finally come face to face in the future (last story) That was such a cheesy and contrived ending. I would have liked better if the entire plot had Blaze and Ember together through the ages, meeting in different ways and unconsciously remembering one another, instead of them finding others and the story shifting to their children and then their grandchildren. Still, a decent read, with interesting stories."
2,Isle of Woman,"I find it amazing that so many people champion this book for being an entertaining novel while admitting that its historical inaccuracies permeate throughout. It is my opinion that authors who attempt to use history as their stage for fiction must be held accountable for their veracity and lack thereof. Historical accuracy is the glue that holds a story such as this together. And in my view, it falls apart in too many places. I freely admit that this novel is listed as a ""Fantasy"" and I accept it as such. And the historical settings chosen are of an interesting variety. The first several chapters are very captivating and well conceived. However, just as the story begins with great promise it ends like the last swallow of a flat beer. The final chapter was horribly contrived and pathetic. See for yourself. I do commend Mr. Anthony for his efforts and his inspiration. The idea for this story is wonderful and original. It is simply too bad that the execution is marginal at best."
2,Completely misguided,The author said this book was supposed to be about how thing man did to survive are killing the earth.His point was totally overshadowed by all the rape and sex that happened in the first half of the book. I have no idea why these scenes were needed as they added absolutely nothing of value to the story.I did like the overall layout of the book. Following a family through the eons and learning a bit of the history of the times was interesting.
5,I loved how Anthony turned a billion years into a lifetime.,"Anthony did a masterful job of taking a single family through a billion years of evolution in a matter of pages. You get drawn into the the chapters of the book and the lives of Blaze, Ember and Stone and all the others. At first the situations may seem trivial but they bring you into the time frame and give you and upclose look at our evolution through the lives of some familiar and reapearing characters. I look forward to all of his GeoOddsey series. Go Piers!"
3,Not impressed,"While the concept is intriguing and the plot is interesting, when's the last time you read a novel where the author began a sentence with, ""These ones...""? Unfortunately, I found the quality of the writing far below par. It had the ""feel"" of having been written by a high school student.I can't recall having read any other books by Anthony. I'll probably try something else by him (not from this series), but, if ""Isle of Women"" is any indication, I don't have high hopes of becoming a loyal fan."
1,"This APPEARS BROWN, what you RECIEVE is GREEN","This APPEARS BROWN, what you RECIEVE is GREENThis product appears brown however what you recieve is green.I have emailed the merchant to see what can be done but, be aware."
1,Junk stay away,"I wish I had read the one review on this item, I wouldn't have purchased it. It doesn't cut a clean edge. It is more of an edge comber. An edger that doesn't edge is not an edger. The tiller doesn't spin the blade fast enough to make it cut the long grass at the edges of my lawn. I even sharpened the blades hopping it would work better, it didn't. I am so surprised that Mantis actually sells this item. I can't believe anyone would be happy with its performance. The tool is made beautifully, it just doesn't work. Buy an edger, you will be miles ahead. POOR PRODUCT."
4,Great Electric Blues,"The reason I'm not giving this double cd a five star rating is because of the repetitive undercurrent throughout the disc. T-Bone Walker is a fantastic guitar player, though, in my opinion, not as good as Lonnie Johnson. Walker's vocals are solid and his lyrics are often very creative. This cd is very expensively priced, so you are probably better off trying to buy it used or obtain the tracks in some other way."
5,volaire rocks............,"this is such an awesome ablum and Voltaire's a really neet-o guy, so everyone should buy this album because it's really good. it's really really awesome dark folk, it's so great!"
5,It's just too easy when you're evil and cheesy!,"Voltaire & his band are friends of mine, and I also Love their music, it's sarcastic humor and beautiful violin and chello and that extremely original goth folk music sound, at times it reminds me of pirate or eastern europe music. His comic books are great too, don't ever miss a chance to see them live (run if they pull out the rubber chicken LOL) and hear the one and only stand up goth comedian sing and play their beautiful Melodies. Most the songs are up beat, but my favorite is Anniversary, the slow song, if I ever get married(ha!) this is going to be my wedding song and I'm making Voltaire play at my wedding <wink>. My jewish family loves his version of Shalom! I would also reccomend Rasputina if you like Voltaire and vice versa."
5,A definite must have for all lovers of things that are Evil.,"This was a great CD. It's gothic sound is perfectly accompanied by satiricaly humorus lyrics.I have to say, this is one of my favorite CD's in my collection.."
5,The very best album created by half-mortal man,"Devil's Bris is most definitely the best cd I have. It's a fine piece of work. It's humor is morbid and dark, and is greatly amusing. The lyrics, melodies, and discography were thrown together with a great sense of passion. If there ever was just one cd to get, this is the one."
5,The Best CD The Never Made It,"I cannot express how wonderful this CD is. It's musical genius. There's humor, horror, and heartfelt emotion in these songs. You couldn't ask for a better CD. If you did, you wouldn't get it, because this is by far the best thing I've ever heard. Buy it! Voltaire deserves to be bigger than anyone else."
5,goth at its best,"i bought this cd after hearing the song, ""when you're evil"" thinking that that would be the only worthwile song on the album. i was surprised to find that i liked many of the songs better than the afore mentioned song. still one of the funniest and most interesting songs i've ever heard, but it can't compare to ""ex lover's lovers"" or ""aniversery.""if you get this cd you won't be disappointed. it hasn't left my cdplayed in the two months i've had it."
2,"The Glucose Revolution, pocket guide","My husband has hypoglycemia. He has to be on a low blood sugar diet. I was happy to see this book, but was soon disappointed. The book tells you to eat foods like rice, potatoes, breads, pastas, raisins, corn and many more items that raises your blood sugar level. Although it does have some good points, this pocket food guide is not for a hypoglycemic. A good book that is worth looking into is Sugar Busters."
1,Complete waste of money,I read previous reviews and ordered it anyway. There is only one Mighty Mouse cartoon and it is repeated twice. Poor quality and very boring cartoons. The best part is the packaging with a nice Mighty Mouse character on the paper. I will never watch this thing again as I already threw it away.
1,Mighty Mouse and Other Cartoon Treasures,"I agree with the review that said this DVD was complete waste of money. Two Mighty Mouse cartoons on the whole DVD, and they were the same cartoon. I was looking for Mighty Mouse cartoons not the other garbage that I got. I was not happy with this purchase at all. This should not be advertised as Mighty Mouse, it is very misleading."
1,STOP!!!,Poor quality. I got the exact same dvd...from the dollar store. I may watch it again. Ok for $1.
4,Lots of neat ideas,"First off, I should note that I am not a preschool teacher, just a mom! I bought this book hoping it would have lots of pages, ideas, etc to print off so I could ""school"" my 3/4 year old. It does have lots of ideas, but they are all in written format and they require a significant amount of supplies. If that is what you are looking for, this book is great. If you were wanting worksheets, try another book."
1,Cumbersome,I was really excited about this book as I thought it would put fun ideas for my classroom at my fingertips. Sadly this book is awkward to use (organized in an unhelpful way); taking longer to find activities here than it does to search the internet.
4,Superb Follow Up,"I bought this book on a Sunday, and consumed it with frevor by Tuesday afternoon. It was superbly written and very sensual. You could almost hear the story through the paper. I'm glad that the follow up was so well written and thought- and image-provoking. David, the wait was well worth it. I am sorry to hear about your accident. I hope you have survived from it. And I am sure your fans appreciate the effort you have placed in writing the book."
2,moved on to another book...,"I really wanted to like it, there were moments, but all in all, didn't even finish it."
3,Mediocre,"It's product is not great and it's not bad. I take a lot of vitamins, so maybe I have higher expectations, but I felt no real significant difference."
5,Wonderful break from mint!,"I love this toothpaste due to the flavor. I have searched for a good alternative to mint, and have found it in this flavor. I am having more difficulty finding it in stores, though. Very disappointing. Will continue to search in stores, though, as I have grown to rely on this flavor. (Mint makes me gag.) Would recommend this to adults who are tired of the typical mint toothpaste. (great for kids too)"
3,Better than mint but still too strong,"I am notorious for using children's toothpaste because adult toothpaste has such a strong taste that it often makes me sick and causes me to gag or throw up. It's definitely not pleasant and, needless to say, doesn't help for keeping your teeth clean.Faced with a very small variety of toothpaste products not too long ago, I chose citrus because I figured it couldn't be as bad as any of the other mint toothpastes and I was right: it's not as bad but it's still awfully strong and i can just barely tolerate it.I don't know why toothpaste must be so strong. It burns to taste and smell and leaves your mouth feeling awful but I guess this is the price we must pay for clean mouths and teeth.If you're like me, this toothpaste probably isn't worth enduring. At least it contains mouthwash so I don't have to deal with 2 foul tasting products."
1,outdated pivot tables,"the info is outdated for 2007....some info that pertains, but not what I needed to fully understand how to do pivot tables step by step"
4,Data Analysis Book,The book gives you a good start in Excel and covers most common topics. I haven't gone through it completely but looks good so far.It arrived on time and in good condition.
5,Solti Surpassed,"The Chicago Symphony has always been famous for its brass playing and Wagner, with Solti's recordings the standard for the industry. Barenboim has now surpassed that standard in a recording that will astonish those familiar with the difficulties of the music, setting a standard of excellence and musicality (with one exception)that will be hard to exceed. The exception is where speed is chosen to display athleticism. And that has its own pleasure."
1,Caricature conducting,"I love these pieces, but was very disappointed by the performances on this CD. The conductor seems to have no conception of subtlety. He excels at grossly exaggerated gestures--transitions are ham-fisted, fast tempi are blasted through full bore, slow tempi are dragged out painfully. Orchestral textures that are finely balanced in other renditions are a muddled blur in this recording, even at ultra slow tempo. Listen on headphones and hear someone (the conductor, presumably) grunting along with the melody line (Lohengrin, Act III prelude, Meistersinger). I would recommend other versions of this great music (i.e., Solti)."
3,A disappointing recording,"Listening to Wagner's ""Tannhauser"" overture over a dry , chilled martini is one of the most spiritually levitating experiences this side of the grave .Having said that , this particular recording leaves a lot to be desired_____ it is competent but mediocre . It lacks that armor piercing elan for which we worship Wagner's music . The tempo just does not sound right and the sound falls flat on the eardrum . This recording fails to convey the throbbing grandeur & the palpable sensuality for which this music is justifiably revered .My favorite recording of these pieces is the much cheaper Excelsior recording on CD_____now that is something!"
3,Mmmmm...,Good buy. I love wasabi and wasabi these coated peas are very good. Sometimes the peas are a bit hard -- maybe not dried /roasted quite right.
4,Good snack,I first found these at a local health store. My kids like them and prefer they eat a few of these then a whole bunch of other candy.The small bags are convenient to carry around.
1,NOT the one my family owned - and not worth buying,This collection is not worthy of the wise and witty man.It lacks many very special quotes. I came away wondering why these were chosen while others were ignored.There are excellent compilations; this is not one of them.
3,Know What You're Getting,Be aware that the title of this book is somewhat misleading. This is not an introduction to Win32 API programming. This text presupposes knowledge of Win16 API programming and C.
1,not great,"I ordered this book online thinking it would be cool to have all books in one book so to speak. I was disappointed, each page is split into 2 in the middle, it was not fun reading, and i actually returned it."
3,8 Books in 1: Jane Austen's Complete Novels,"The type is very small. It is more comfortable to read a book printed as an individual book. I should have thought this through before ordering a book with all 8 books in one. On the other hand, if you just want to take one book with you, you have 8 to read and only have to carry one. So, for that reason, it's quite a bargain."
2,"Flimsy spine, tiny print","The illustrations are nice and it's great to have all these books in one volume, but the spine doesn't feel durable enough for the size of the book, and the type is small to the point of causing eyestrain. If I had it to do over again, I probably would've sprung for nice small hardbacks of the individual books -- certainly less convenient but a more enjoyable tactile experience."
4,Pride and Prejudice,I have the video of one of the older versions of the movie and I also have the cd of the most recent movie. I love both of them so much that I had to get the book since it gives you more of an indebt of the thoughts etc. of the characters.I love the book
3,too compressed,"Yes all the great stories are included and the price is good but the printing structure is poor. The pages are printed with double columns per page and are too closely printed to the page spin, header and footer. Also the printing is in very small font. The printing structure makes reading difficult."
3,Don't buy this edition,"I struggled with what rating to give this book. The books are great but this edition is impossible to read. It is a ""large"" soft cover book probably about the same size as a hard cover textbook. There are two columns of text that is very small and closely spaced making it impossible to read. If you are looking for a great value, after all how can you beat the price, this is for you. If you are concerned about readabilty, don't buy this."
2,Book Print not Readable,I Love all of Jane Austen's books but the print in this one is barely readable the print was to small.
1,"Jane Austen, Eight in One, bad idea","I do not recommend this book based soley on the miniscule size of it's print.I have read Austen's books before and wanted the whole collection. I am unable to read this one without a magnifying glass because the print is the size of the worst phone book you have ever tried to read. I intend to get a new collection, this time with readable print. What a mistake this one was!!"
4,A Classic,"This 8 in 1 is a great collection of all of Jane Austen's work. Being a huge Austen fan, this is a delight to have. The pen and ink pictures throughout are very classic to the era and are fun to look through. The only draw back is that the type is super small and two column. Luckily, I have good close up vision, because this font size would challenge most. You definitely need to get your bifocals on this one! Otherwise, it is a fun book to add to one's collection."
5,Excellent Value,This product provides a higher flow rate at 90psi and a larger capacity (6gal) than any other model in the price range. I even looked at some no-name brands from Harbor freight tools and they didn't even come close to the value
4,CPO Porter Cable,"Ordered CPO Porter Cable refurbished compressor. Works and looks new. Easy to carry as well. Only problem was the drain valve was threaded wrong in the tank during the refurb.and I wound up breaking it off trying to unscrew it. Notified company and they said they would send me a new valve, been 2 months and never received the part. Poor rating on customer service but good on performance."
3,Porter-Cable Pancake Compressor,"This product failed after the first 3 weeks. Repairable but the warranty dealer with 70 miles away from my home. I not only delivered it to the dealer, but I waited for them to call when repairs completed. Repairs were completed so I made the 140 mile round trip (that's 70 miles 1 way). 140 miles x 2 = 280 miles. It is operating so far but the automatic shut off has since failed so it's usefulness is limited."
3,Loud as heck..Decent otherwise,"Vibrates any structure it's in, and it's deafeningly loud. This is a prime example of the tool the home centers have ruined.Otherwise, Good capacity and durability is good. Will run a framing gun no problem. But if you work inside look into other quieter brands or you won't get rehired. Rolair and the Makita is nice as well."
3,Not for heavy duty use,"If you are a home owner and use the compressor occasionally for light duty work such as filling the tires, finishing trims, or blow clean work areas, it should work just fine. But don't try to blow out sprinkler system often. This unit is not designed for prolonged work. The rubber tube to the tank gets really hot after 15 minutes of continuous running. The pump gets less and less efficient when it does not get a chance to cool down. I tried to blow out my sprinkler system this year. Due to its small tank and small motor, it usually takes two or three full tanks to blow clean one zone. I can tell that this unit barely survived. It was constantly running for more than one hour. Toward the end, the pump/motor started to make funny noises and the rubber tube got so hot, it felt sticky on the surface.I am now thinking about upgrading to a 3HP oil lubed unit."
1,Didn't last,"Bought this compressor as part of aPorter Cable PC3Pak Finish Nailer/Brad Nailer/Stapler Compressor Combo Kitin 2008. I used it for various home-improvement projects over three and a half years, and found it a pleasure to work with... and then it began to continuously leak air.Seems ok quality for a few projects, but based on my experience, and other negative reviews, don't expect it to last."
1,"Don't buy, if you plan to use it.","I bought this compressor just 1 year ago and used it for one project. The regulator broke, just a short time after I started to use it. The factory sent me a new regulator for it. The new regulator was not the same as the original and took some convertion. I installed it and the compressor worked fine for a while. I bought 1 year ago last week. It now runs but won't pump The factory says it is out of warrenty, and will do nothing about it. I need to buy a new compressor after only one year. The compressor looks like new. I take care of my tools. It has been used very little. Don't buy, it is cheaply made and will not last. I also have a Porter-Cable finish nailer that I used to trim one small bathroom. I tried to use it 2 weeks ago and it will not function properly. I just replaced it with a new one. Please don't buy Porter-Cable. You will be sorry. Thank You."
1,Call the service technician!,"Bougth this comnpressor thinking it would be ideal for trim work. When I plugged it in to start, the hose from the compressor to the tank heated up and air came out between the compressor and the tank. Directions on the packaging states if this happens, call a service technician. This is a brand new compressor, what's with the defect?"
1,Poorly Made,I had this compressor for about two weeks and the pressure switch broke. The price for a new pressure switch was half the cost of the compressor. I ended up throwing it out and buying a better brand.
1,Bad bad parts - do not buy,"C002 has a manifold that after 1 year a back compression screw comes out. The screws threads are short, so when you try to put it back in, it strips, costing you $44 plus shipping for a new manifold.Check out their web site, this manifold is back ordered and you can't even get it now."
3,referb,I like this compressor and it does what I wanted it to do. It is marketed as having 13 piece accessory kit. When I coun't everything including the manuel I can't count past nine?
2,Great While It Lasted,"I purchased a reconditioned model two years ago. Yesterday, the air pressure regulator failed; it would not allow any pressure at all. I was going to purchase a new regulator, but, in order to do this, I would have to buy a complete manifold at a cost of around $80 including shipping. This is almost as much as I paid for the compressor, so I have decided to try another brand this time--and a new one rather than a reconditioned item. The lack of individual, inexpensive parts, and the difficulty in finding the parts, prompted my decision to buy another brand. I can't afford to buy or repair a compressor every two years, particularly when it has had very limited use and has been treated with care."
1,Regulator busted after minimal use over two years time.,"I have owned this compressor four a little over two years. I am a home owner that used to work doing finish carpentry. I used this compressor to trim out my house inside, some windows outside and build a deck. During hurricane sandy I needed it to quickly build a leantwo for my generator after the power went and the regulator failed on me after firing two nails. I geuss you get what you pay for. It took weeks for the new part to arrive, they were backordered across the web. I clearly am not the only one to have this problem and it is not a warranty item. The part cost $55 plus $10 for shipping. Ouch!"
1,A new piece of equipment needs repair,"The tank pressure gauge did not work. I called Porter Cable and they told me to take it to their local service center which was The Tool Store in Green Bay. They told me that they were very busy and it would take two weeks for the repair. It disappoints me to be required to wait two weeks to use a NEW piece of equipment to be repaired, plus, the inconvenience of travelling 60 miles round trip twice(once to drop it off and then to pick it up two weeks later. Not a happy customer!"
3,Needs details,"The description does not go into detail of the quantity that you receive. While for under $5, I did not expect much, I did expect to receive more than 6 paper thin slices.The prosciutto itself is good, and arrived cold.... but remember: you don't get much with this item."
3,Serve their purpose,"I ordered these for a friend and when they showed up they were hollow and the back isn't filled in so from the back they are really noticeable. There are better ones out there for cheaper prices, my suggestion is, though they do hide the front of the piercing fairly well, move on and find a better pair."
4,"Okay at hiding, better at covering","Sometimes when I wear these I forget my ears are stretched to 0g! However, you can still see them in the ears and they don't make my holes completely invisible. They only do a decent job at concealing the holes against my skintone. I like these best for wearing regular post earrings meant for non-stretched ears. I poke the regular post earring through the silicone hider plug and if the earring is big enough, the hole is completely covered."
1,Poorly Written Overview of tax heavens,"I expected to get advice on the legality of establishing an offshore corporation. In particular, how to legally retain earnings inside the corporation.Instead I got a very general review of many World Tax Heavens, a kind of information I could read on the internet for free.The book is strewn over with useless bits of information. Do I really need to know the quality of beaches in the Bahamas?Do not buy this book if you want useful guide to offshore copmany formation and tax planning."
2,same leaks,"i bought this and it leaked,tried to contact some 1 but no responce as of yet,it leaks at seam and drain"
4,Good planter,We bought two of these and after drilling some holes in the bottom use them as planters for our herb garden. They are great.
1,A complete waste of my time!,"This book is plane terrible! I can understand that it doesn't resemble the TV show or the movies. I was actually expecting that and I was curious about it. I wasn't a super big fan of the show anyway, though I liked the episodes I watched. I didn't like the movies, I found them childish. Now, the book is horrible! I kept wishing for Carry to break up with Mr Big! I hated them both and I hated their relationship! I was expecting a book portraying strong, independent, intelligent women, but what I actually found was a bunch of seemingly poor women who didn't have enough money to pay the rent, spending their money on expensive bags and coats and sleeping with rich guys just to get ahead. Oh, and of course! How can I forget about the drugs! They are high all the time! If you haven't read this book: don't read it! Don't buy it! Run while you can!"
3,"Interesting, I suppose","An entertaining read, to be sure, but quite cynical and thematically lacking in warmth. Cattiness can be fun, but if the character has no soul, who cares? Ugh. Not I.Read JANE GREEN instead. ""Mr. Maybe"" is a great book with which to start."
2,"The show was much, much better","I agree with the last reviewer. This was an irritating read, because it portrayed men as losers, and women as desperate. Give us a break! This is filled with stuff that makes you want to stop dating all together. It's not the least bit funny or interesting, like the show is. This could of been a great book. What the heck happened?!"
2,The show outshines the book,"Considering the popularity and entertainment of the show, Sex and the City, the book, did not bring me nearly as much pleasure. Although easy to read, I had to actually dispose of the book after reading it. I thought the author's descriptions were boring, and stale, and the way the book jumped around without direction was hopeless! HBO- YES, Candace- NO"
3,Entertaining yet dismal view of Manhattan mating rituals,"Funny, yes. Optomistic, no. Bushnell writes an entertaining editorial style narrative of her so-called friends but underneath it all I felt sorry for her; not what she intended, I'm sure. Manhattan is chic but is the misery of living there worth it? Ultimately, I felt relief that NYC was a city I adore visiting and not living. Good voyeuristic read at best."
4,No.. Its not the HBO version .. BUT its a worthwhile read,"A bit depressing.. but more realistic. When I watch the HBO show I want to fly off to New York and live in the the glamorous circle of Carrie and friends. When I read the book I got more inside on just how plain nasty alot of the people are in Manhatran with their society, careers, etc. I think I will stay on the West Coast thank.you.very.much. I really enjoyed Bushnell's writing and although it is doubtful that you feel connected with any of the characters the stories are a fascinating social critique."
3,Solid 3 stars,"The book is more like a collection of short stories with characters who aren't really connected with each other. It's just a daily and nightly observation of NY and the people who live there. A lot of them are shallow, some funny, others miserable, but all seem to be survivors and relentless pursuers of their dream. Candace Bushnell has a great eye for details and is very funny. However, I don't see myself rereading this book. It's just so all over the place and none of the characters is developed well enough for you too care about their life. A solid ""C""!"
3,the book that starts a huge phenonmon,"I am a huge fan of the televison show! I have every episode on dvd. When I found out that their was book for the show I was really excited. Each chapter pretty much has a subject regarding realationships. For example their was a chapter about threesomes. Characters would then tell what they thought about the subject. It would also have stories that would go with the subject. Some of the stories are so so funny!Most of the book their is a big story with Carrie and Mr. Big. You really don't hear to much with Charlotte,Sam or Miranda and their stories.If you love this show like I did, you should maybe check out the book"
2,a collection of some fragmented articles,"If you're after Carrie & Mr Big's story, probably you'll be disappointed - instead of a complete storyline, the book is a collection of some fragmented articles (originally appeared on a newspaper). I think the TV drama, which was based on & inspired by this book, is far more entertaining.But I must say Ms Bushnell has made some interesting & remarkable observation of relationship pattern in big cities. Quite impressive."
2,Very different from the beloved show,"While this book undoubtedly made a wonderful column, it transalted differently onto the big screen. It is very entertaining, although the cast of characters varies, and the ending differs from SITC's.Bushnell is a great writer, but her fiction feels vastly removed from column work such as this collection.If you can approach this book with an open mind, you may very well enjoy it. If Carrie-mania alone inspires you to read it--you may be starkly let-down."
3,Worth a glance--good dental office read!,"Bushnell gives an overview of sexual habits of the drug and alcohol addicted trendoids in New York. Not one of the characters is likeable, profound--or very bright.This makes the short vignettes a requirement--otherwise one would become bored with the kiss-and-tell gossip. Still, jumping from one story to another--some a paragraph long--becomes deadening after a while. This is an attention deficit world she is describing in a writing style for those who cannot stay interested for longer than a few minutes."
2,LOVE THE SHOW; HATED THE BOOK,"I love sex in the city, the show, but the book just wasn't enough for me; it really lacked something. It didn't give enough details about Big and Carrie or anybody; it was more like a bang bang and your done book."
2,A disappointing read,"I didn't expect the book to mirror the TV series, but I did expect Bushnell's writing to be of a higher caliber. I was surprised to see how careless and ordinary her writing is, considering her accolades; this book might have been scribbled slap-dash while commuting on the subway. Disjointed scenes, dull writing style, and you find yourself waiting for the point of each story, only to have it dribble off lamely. The style of this book is that of a conversation with the author, but if you met someone at a party who told such pointless rambling stories, you'd walk away yawning."
1,HORRIBLE AWFUL DEPRESSING,"Stick to the cable series, it's much better. I was really looking forward to reading the book (because the book is usually better than the movie/tv show, right? WRONG!).The book is SO poorly written (random dialogue with nothing to tie the random comments together), there's no story that I could discern, the characters are loathsome and shallow and devoid of any redeeming qualities. I had trouble picturing these ""stories"" as newspaper articles either. What was the point of this book??If you're really curious, BORROW IT first."
1,Just not very good,"No plot, weak characters, pointless lives... this book just left a bad taste in my mouth. Random chapters about interviews with perverts interspersed with little tidbits about Carrie and Mr. Big. Who cares? I certainly don't. Bushnell's other books are so much better! Skip it!"
1,extremely disaponted,"I was very disaponted with the book. It seemed like the characters were hopping around so much that I couldnt figure out what was going on. I love the movie and I own every season, the book was just disapointing."
3,A Decent Beach Read,"To me, this is the kind of book you can read during commercials of your favorite tv show. People with small attention spans will appreciate its disorganized yet witty style.Being a born and raised Manhattanite, I was able to identify all too well with the sad cast of characters Ms. Bushnell portays. They are merely characatures of themselves and after reading the book, I was further reassured that leaving The Big Apple was the best choice for me. I wouldn't trade my life with any of those money-hungry, attention seeking, shallow individuals. I only enjoyed the book because it's always fun to read sordid tales of the city."
3,Expected more,"I was hoping that the book would be better than the television show, and it wasn't. The show, with its amusing quips, puns and overreaching pseudointellectual analyses of female behavior, is entertaining in a vegetative sort of way. The book should have had more depth. Yes, I'm sure there are women in NYC who claim to be looking for love as they hop from bed to bed hoping to change men into what they want. I hope to high Heaven that the denizens of real NYC are nothing like the flaky women in Candace Bushnell's Sex In The City. Mr. Big is just as egregious in the book as he's portrayed in the HBO show. On the plus side, Patricial Field does a great job with Carrie's wardrobe on the show."
4,surprisingly worthwhile,"i am a fan of the HBO show, Sex and the City. This book is slightly different from the show but if you do not know the show you will be a little confused.As someone who is academically interested in sex and gender issues, this particular book brings more of a human face on the social phenonomon of twenty and thirty year old women who are living single. And it feels like something i relate to as well. I think that the book could be an important crossroad for pop culture and academia culture in terms of this particular issue that our society is attempting to understand and come to terms with.Also reccomended from this point of view: 100 years of living single"
1,Yawn,"Like some others, I bought the book because I enjoyed the HBO series. As a 30-something recently single woman I identified with the dilemmas and frustrations of the show's characters. The book, however, has none of the the TV show's wit or insightfulness. The characters are souless, the plot nonexistent. A colossal bore."
2,19th Century Sex (or Sex and the Shtetl),"What was the point of female liberation and emancipation, when all women want is to define themselves through their (missing) halves? Is the modern girl, really not more than a walking incubator? Why did our mothers and grandmothers, burn their bras? Just to make way for Miracle bras with water inlays? Why did woman want to have the option to fend for herself, when really all she wants is to be dependant? Why are we brainwashed into thinking, that singles are social lepers? If all woman wants, is to sit in the boudoir and weave tapestry, we needn't have bothered with women's rights. Girls go out after work, get drunk, have one night stands, hope it's Mr. Right (or Big, for that matter), and to add insult to injury, feel like they have just auditioned for a part in Sex and the City.If the Four Ladies would have lived at the turn of the Century in Poland, they would have been married by now and would have longed for a career.Arranged Marriage anyone??"
2,Didnt care for this book.,"I am big fan of the HBO series Sex and the City. I waited years to read this book. I could have waited a few more! None of the characters in the TV series are hardly in the book, and if they are they are either 100% different from what is portrayed in the series or are vaguely mentioned. The book is a series of short stories/essays about single women and men in NYC looking for love in all the wrong places. I could not relate one bit. The men are basically losers and the women are portrayed as desperate to find mates, but since the men are losers, well.... you get the point. If you find yourself wanting to buy this book, watch the series instead. At least those characters are more ""human"" and real than the winers in this book. What a waste of time and effort."
2,What a Depressing Book!,"I used to wonder why ""entertainment"" people found ""American Beauty"" to be such an accurate portrayal of life in the suburbs. If the characters in this book are even only half-way based on reality, they lead some hopelessly pathetic lives, and I would imagine they assume we are all hopeless. I watch the show, and at least those women show a little backbone and spunk. The women in the book regularly berate the other women whom they see as being spineless, when the reality is that NO self-respecting woman would put up with any of the men and vice versa. A sad commentary on life in the ""Big Apple"" - looks like a lot of worms in there to me."
2,Hard Shelled Women,"As much as I am a big fan of the HBO show, I was a little disappointed with the book. Understanding why the show must simplfy the book's storylines for the sanity of the viewers and create its own world, I found the book at times witty, but, so depressing. I'm in my late-20s, already divorced, tackled my own addictions head-on and this book made me ask who in the world would want to conitue living like that? It made me realize I would never want to move to New York out of fear of becoming a cynical, hard-shelled, gold-digging, single woman who worries more about reputation than all that life offers and all its second chances. Thank God I live in Pacific Northwest where we're slightly more optimistic about love and life in general."
1,THERE IS SOMETHING BETTER!,"Look. Seriously, now. If you like the show or the book even a little bit, you realllllly need to investigate books by Cynthia Heimel. Heimel was the original and she remains the best. She's smarter and funnier and a thousand times more interesting than Candace Bushnell or Carrie Bradshaw. Heimel is a little grittier than SATC. She's weak for shoes and designer clothes but she lives strictly in the real world. Please, please PLEASE read ""Sex Tip For Girls"" or ""But Enough About You"" or ""If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet"" if you want to see what Candace Bushnell is DESPERATELY TRYING to do! Try Heimel once. You'll never read Bushnell again. You're welcome!"
1,Stick to the Show,"Alright, so I love the series. I thought, hey the book should be awesome. I understand the book came out first, but I don't know how the show was ""based on the book by Candace Bushnell"" because it's not really. There are some stories similar.. Big calls her ""Kid"", but her friends are different, the characters are not the same at all, they don't even do the same things. Carrie is ""some journalist"". It was hard to read beacause there were so many names to remember, so many stories that weren't related, then it jumped to real life, past, present... everything. I got through half the book and i'm debating whether to continue. So far, it's awful. Stick to the show! Find a differeny author to get life and love advice from."
1,"If People in New York Were Really Like This, I'd Move","While the HBO series ""Sex and the City is, as mentioned in a previous review, bright and funny, the book was a sad attempt to titillate the reader with boorish tales of the supposedly glamorous lives of pathetic, conceited nobodies languishing in their own misery. Bushnell's writing style is disjointed and elementary. The characters are patently obnoxious and predictable. A real yawn - I couldn't get through it. Very disappointing considering I was hoping for a fun vacation read. I would normally never promote TV over reading, but in this case - watch the show."
2,Lacks Zsa Zsa Zsou,"Okay, so I bought the book because I'm a fan of the show, and the movie was fun, if not as sexy and smart as the series. I just found this book really boring - it seemed as though Bushnell couldn't really be bothered writing it... maybe that was to convey the superficiality and heartlessness of the people, but how can you care about people like that?Give me the show over this any day - in the end it was the friendships between Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha that gave it its zsa zsa zsou - and the superb acting.Some chapters are insightful but overall, it's bland. I'm just glad that it spawned the series though!"
4,"Good, but not too good!","I really enjoyed reading this book. It was funny, sexy, and very straight forward. Having watched all six seasons of the HBO series, I could see where several episodes originated. I believe that most people expected it to be more like the series. It was not! I think the problem isn't that the book is bad, but the series was too good! It would be more appreciated by a person who has never watched the tv series. I would definitely recommend this book!"
2,Uninteresting Read,"I love the show (I've seen all the re-runs a million times!) but the book was just not good. I was really disappointed. It is very difficult to follow, and there is no real ""flow"" to the book. The characters are very unlikeable and nothing like the characters on the show. I kept reading the book, hoping that it would get better, but it never did. I will stick with watching re-runs of the show."
1,The screenwriters were geniuses!,"What a disappointment. The TV series bears almost no resemblance to the book. A few character names are the same and the ""Carrie"" and ""Mr. Big"" characters are drawn roughly the same as the TV characters. All I can say is that the TV scriptwriters did an outstanding job at developing the series' well-rounded characters from this mess of a ""book."" There is virtually no plot or character development. The book is a collection of seemingly unconnected short essays in interview format. Bushnell owes a debt of gratitude to the screenplay writer who was genius enough to take her twisted mess of words and turn them into the scintillating story that we know from the series."
4,show or book?,"My favorite show is Sex and the City on HBO. I never miss it. So I decided to buy the book, to read more about Carrie and the girls. It isn't exactly like the show, which I expected. I did really enjoy it nonetheless. Sometimes it was hard to keep up with all the names, but I still could not put it down. I love short stories, it made it quicker to read...I was hoping for more. Bushnell tells it like it is."
2,Boring compared to the series,"LOVE the HBO series for its wit and sharpness. The book by comparison is more breezy than a magazine and unsatisfying and not as funny. If you're a true fan of the series, the book will prove thin and dull."
2,"Emotionally Disturbed-Party of One, your table is ready!","Being a serious student of literature, this book made me feel guilty for reading it. It is the equivalent of watching soap operas while devouring a carton of Ben & Jerry's, or lying on your belly with your ear pressed against the heating vent trying to overhear your neighbors sordid affair with her brother-in-law. It leaves you with a (simultaneous) feeling of both horror (you can't believe you're still reading the thing), and of real self worth (thankful that you succesfully graduated high school - mentally - when you were supposed to...). Yet for some reason (read: train wreck - for example) you can't keep your eyes off of it. I kept waiting for a moment of self revelation (from anyone) up until the abrupt and unconclusive ending. Although, I'm sad to admit, in some sick way, it did cause me to giggle a little."
1,sssshhhh listen! You can hear the wind blowin' in her head,"What if the airhead girl, who led the popular clique, grew up and wrote a book? Well here it is!No plot No dialouge No senatances that make any senseTo be quite honest, I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. I got about half way through it until I set it down for the last time.Do yourself a favor, go read your cereal box. It is more entertaining."
1,looking for sarah jessica parker? subscribe to HBO,"im a huge fan of the hit HBO series, Sex and the City, so i decided between seasons i would read the book.big mistake!how someone turned these ghastly characters into something so addicting on television is beyond me. no one is as they seem. the loveable Skipper and Stanford Blatch characters are egotistical and unfriendly on these pages. Miranda in the book seems to have the Samantha persona from television. Charlotte also does a 180 from paper to tv by being very cynical and mirandaish.the book and the show are very different with a big flip flop of characters. leave this confusing mess where is lies on the shelves of your local bookstore."
1,Never saw the HBO show and still hated the book,"I wanted to demand my money back - I kept reading the book expecting for it to get better, to somehow justify all the hype I've heard about the HBO series, but it was, in a word, PATHETIC! The women were pathetic losers with no grip on reality, and I feel sorry for anyone who could relate to this book. If this is what people are like in NY city - I'll pass. I bought the book because, now that the tv series is over, I thought I might one day watch it in syndication, and that it would be good to read the book as background, but I'm sorry that I read it, and will now skip it in reruns as well."
1,Don't Read This!,"I bought this expecting something like the series on HBO, it even had Sarah Jessica Parker on the front. It was something that I didnt enjoy, it was all dark drug use, nothing like the series. Dont read this book!!! Donate the money to charity- it would be better spent."
3,Outrageous!,"New York in the nude. Makes me think of the saying: ""If you can make it in NY, you can make it anywhere"".Honest, fast paced. Neurotic. Utterly obsessive"
2,Show's better,"Seeing the weekly HBO SEX in the City enticed me to read the book, but seeing the characters come alive on TV was much better. Although the book was the catalyst for the HBO series, I must admit the series writing, directing, acting etc. was better than reading the book."
2,Blah...,Compared to the Show.....blah. You will be disappointed in this book if you are a fan of the show. The story line is the usual....but the character development and plot are boring. Weak.
2,"How they got the show out of this, I don't know","I am a diehard fan of the show, so I decided to read this. This book was really disappointing. Basically this book just includes a lot of quotes and situations from the very first episode. That is about it."
3,Sex and the City,"Well...let's just say this book isn't quite as good as the first book title 4 BLONDES. This book has no story to it what so ever, and is packed with five lined stories that don't go with eachother as well. There are way better SEX AND THE CITY BOOKS such as DATING GAME and the new one that comes out NOVEMBER 15 intitled KISS AND TELL. I would not recamend this book to anyone but if your a big fan...I'd say it's a must have~but you can be the judge of that!"
4,"Vaguely Reminiscent of the Series, but still a good read.","You are a die-hard Sex and the City fan. You have seen every episode. You bid on the auctions on ebay. This book will disappoint you because expectations are so high.The book is excellent and sassy in it's own right, but once compared the series, it falls flat. That's because I think the content is much better portrayed on screen.This book is definately worth reading. The writing is crisp and flavorful and witty. You recognize many of the main characters and some of the early themes of the shows.But brace yrself. It is much different from the series. Be objective."
3,Witty and Satirical.,"Unlike the t.v. series, the humor is more subtle. No doubt this won't appeal to everyone. If your looking for a refreshing lite read then pick this up. If however, you prefer more obvious titilation then stick to the t.v series."
2,A little disappointing...,"As a HUGE fan of the HBO series I figured that this was a must read. The book is always better than the movie / tv show, right? Wrong. Kudos to Darren Starr for taking this disjointed collection of non-sense and making a successful series out of it. True, it wasn't all bad - just most of it was. This book has soured me from wanting to read Ms. Busnell's newest endeavor."
1,Total waste of reading time,"This book is horrible. What a badly written, plot all over the place...lack luster, piece of crap. I can't believe HBO created their fantastic series from this. It's so dissapointing."
2,Disappointing,"I am a fan of the tv show, and since I knew this book inspired the stories of Carrie and friends I thought It could be entertaining and a way to know the ""basis"" of the characters. To my surprise I found a bunch of unrelated narrations and dialogues, with characters pretty different from the ones in the tv show, following no order, and very difficult to connect. I wouldn't recommend it if you are a fan of Carrie and Co, since you will feel disappointed."
3,In The End...Glad I Read It,"I have long been a fan of the series and have always had it in the back of my mind to read the book that inspired it. I can definitely see where quite a few of the storylines for certain episodes came from and it was a well written, interesting read. In the end though, I found myself thankful for the life I've led. Some reviews have stated that the experiences related in the book are just 'real life' and for some people I'm sure this is true, however, it's no life I've ever been a part of. There is a lot of sadness, loneliness, and not very self aware individuals showcased in this book. I found myself feeling badly for so many of them.Candace Bushnell does an excellent job of relating some of her experiences and drawing the reader in. The overall tone of the book was sad, however."
3,Book vs. TV Show,"Well as many of you are, I am a big fan of Sex & the City the TV show. I own every season on DVD and watch it over and over. When I first decided to order the book I thought it was basically going to be just the like the show that I love. To my utter disappointment it was not. So I put it on my bookshelf thinking I'd never pick it up again. But one weekend I was bored with nothing to do and thought maybe should I try and again and with my expectations much less I found to actually really really enjoy the book. You have to understand that the show is ""based"" or better ""inspired"" by the book. The premise is the same...women having sex like men, the life that goes on in the upper class of New York City, but it's very different. So I definitely recommend it- do I like the show more? Yes I do. But I still really (and very much am enjoying) the book. Candace Bunshell is a very good and witty writer."
1,Awful,I had to give up on this book. I found it boring and poorly written. I have enjoyed some of Candace Bushnell's other books (especially One Fifth Avenue) so I had high hopes for this one. It almost felt like it was written by a different author from some of her other work.
5,OH YES BUT DID ANYONE ACTUALLY READ IT?,"Funny of course, entertaining. This is the modern writing. Unlikeable characters, pointless, but goofy too and funny. I like the show and I know how popular it is but I am hoping against hope that women don't REALLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY because it is a joke. And am I the only person who noticed that the AUTHOR herself admits that MR. BIG is an AMALGAM, an imaginary friend, who CARRIE made up? This is spelled out specifically and when you watch the HBO show you can notice it because NO ONE but CARRIE ever sees Big. Somehow he is always a no show and unavailable. People get introduced to him but he never responds. That's because, silly girls, the PERFECT MAN does not exist. That's why you can never find one."
5,"Fantastic, Unique Book","When I finally got around to reading Sex and the City I was amazed that this was the book that supposedly started the chick-lit genre. The book Sex and the City is not a feel good chick story, rather a journalistic look at sex and relationships in New York City in the 90's. I was addicted to reading these juicy vignettes and couldn't put this book down. Sex and the City is truly a groundbreaking look at the real life of a single woman in New York."
2,"Entertaining, but...","I read it the whole way through and it kept me interested I can give it that--largely because it was funny, juicy and I reckon most or all of the characters in the book are from real-life, in Candaces' drug induced New York life, but puh-lease, 'waaa poor me, so rich, so neurotic, so beautiful.' In the end this book is about mean, selfish, pig-headed men and women who rule New York society and I am so glad I think life is more than going to a cool bar, having sex with hundreds of men, taking copius amounts of drugs and stressing over which bag goes with my new Manolo Blahink shoes. Woe is me, woe is ...!Chalk it down to a funny social commentary with no substance."
3,"Entertaining, but not quite what I expected","I'm a late arrival to the ""Sex and the City"" fan club (I don't have HBO) but fell in love with the series and the characters once it made it to TBS. I've since gotten the original episodes on DVD (delighfully steamy!) In picking up the book that inspired the series, I rather expected it to be a lot more like the series, so was a bit disappointed in the reality. That being said, there are still many familiar stories in the book that clearly inspired many of the episodes, and Bushnell is a very clever writer. I'm still glad I read it."
3,Tv show is better!,"I really enjoyed to read this book, because I love Sex and the City. I watched every episode. I read the book Sex and the City and I also saw it in Tv, but I have to be honest that the show was much better because you got more informations about each character. In the book the characters are not the same as in the show. I was a little dissapointed, that the book was not that good as the show."
1,Nothing like the HBO series,"I 've always found the TV series wonderful, smart and entertaining.Well, this book isn't. It does give you a glimpse to the same kind of society, and then there's endless babbling about everything one can imagine, accompanied by some sexual innuedo and a depressing atmosphere of vanity and temporarity.Really, the characters from the series either are not present, or they 're totally different, and there is nothing compelling to read about in it, anyway.So, just don't bother."
1,lucky candace is not responsible for the tv show,"If you love the show, don't buy this book! It's good Candace gave the idea for the TV series but that's all. The book is very badly written, incoherent and not at all like the TV series. There are none of the characters that you find in the series and except for the first episode you won't find a lot of similarities. In short: a waste of time & money"
2,Freezes my kindle,Can't open the book it freezes my kindle. Not sure what the problem is. . . . . . .
4,Good read,Didn't love it as I love the series but it was a good read. It gives other things about the characters that we only can learn by reading the original story.
1,TV was actually better than the book,"Over 1/2 way through this book you still don't know the name of the narrator. This was quite possibly the worst read ever. I can always find a redeeming quality in every book, but this was the first time that I couldn't. I couldn't even gather up the strength to finish this. It's amazing that HBO saw something good enough in this book to create such an amazing series! This is the first time that I have ever found TV, or the movie, to be better than the book. Unless you want to read vague and boring conversation about the rules of threesomes (yes, vague and boring: it wouldn't even turn on a nymphomaniac) DO NOT BUY, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME READING!!!!"
3,"excellent writing...but a sad, depressing story!","I am a huge fan of the show...in fact, watched the first season dvd and then read the book. There is a sad sense of desperation about these people....nights out that end in too much drinking, drugs and sex....and emptiness after. They are so preoccupied with how they look and although they want husbands....the general view is that they don't believe they will ever find someone that will marry them...and so they don't. I found parts of it very perceptive, but overall, depressing as hell! Save your money, and watch the HBO show instead...it is funny, and full of hope."
4,...and it all began here,"I bought this book because I'm a fan of the series. However, that was probably that biggest mistake, you should not approach this book as an addition to your SNTC experience or a rendition of the series. Although, most of the characters are somewhat the same there is a lot of difference (Don't picture Kristin Davis as Charlotte, because those characters are different).The book is very entertaining, and funny and I recommend it, however you have to approach it with a blank slate of a mind.The series is based on the book and some of the characters in it, but there are a lot of big differences (Magda is not Miranda's cleaning lady in the book)The book is a nice way to see where the show got its flavor, but basically it ends there."
2,Mostly boring drivel,"This is a quick read - about the length of two Vanity Fair articles. There were a smattering of amusing vignettes and trenchant one-liners, but it was mostly boring and flat. Bushnell tries for shock value in an era when very little shocks any more. The same material works on TV because the HBO series was a sensual experience: the pleasure of the actresses' beauty and sexuality, their voices, scenes of New York, a glimpse into a world few of us see. On the printed page, the same scenarios are dry."
2,Hard to read if you don't know the series,"I'm a Candace Bushnell fan (Trading Up and 4 Blondes), but I've never seen Sex and the City the TV series. I found this book impossible to get into. It was a bunch of disjointed paragraphs and bold headings that jumped through past and present time and seemed to change narrators. I was never sure who was talking or what was going on, but reviewers who love the show seemed to be able to recognize the inspiration for certain espisodes, so it appears to only make sense as a companion to the TV series.I recommend this book only to people who are looking for more as fans of the TV show. If you are a book lover or a fan of Bushnell as an author, stick with her latest works or other great books about Manhattan life."
1,Can I have my money back?,"I watched the series, read part of the book and kicked myself in the a** for buying the book. Stick to the HBO series and find something worth reading because this book is not it."
5,Loads of Fun,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was interesting to see my favorite show in ""words."" Burbuly boo, burbuly boo, zim zam wammy jam woo woo woo burbuly boo, burbuly boo, splippity, splappity, sploo, sploo, sploo! A great beach read! As in the TV show, I found the characters likeable and easy to relate to. zing zang beeble bibble bop! I think every group of girlfriends has a ""Miranda,"" ""Carrie,"" ""Samantha,"" and ""Charlotte."" Bushnell managed to capture that aspect very well. sneeble, snarble, snooble. I laughed a lot while reading this."
2,What's all the buzz about?,"Typical of a New York Observer writer to pen a cynical, exaggerated account of wealthy Manhattanites. But the series of vignettes didn't convincingly hold together as a book--just a series of romantic foibles between a stable of two-dimensional characters. I've heard a lot of hype about the HBO series. My only hope is that the characters on the show are a little less shallow and self-serving than these women seem to be. Given the material Bushnell has culled here, I'm shocked she portrayed those people in a positive light.Despite all this, there are some incredibly funny and even sweet moments in the book. I'm just glad it's not MY life...."
5,Carrie Fever,I'm an absolute Sex and the City nut. Been addicted to the show for years. Happy to finaly have the book it all come from.
1,Just an idea for the excellent TV series.,"the only merit of this book is that it served as an inspiration for the smart and funny TV series, which I think it's far more meaningful that it may seems at a first glance.The book is dull, badly written, and shallow.It is incredible how different is from the scripts of the TV serial."
2,disappointed,I am disappointed with this product. The tip leaks after use so each time I pour I have to get a paper towel and wipe the bottle/tip so it doesn't pool at the base. For the price of this product I would not expect this to happen.
3,You get what you pay for,"This DVD has a total of 4 episodes, approximately 35 minutes each. Each episode includes 7 different animal attacks (about 5 minutes per animal attack). However, most of the 5 minutes per animal attack, is repeated information. It is okay. You get what you pay for. Episode #1 includes a cobra attack, spinner shark attack, and a bear getting electrocuted. Episode #2 includes a great white shark attack, a man getting run over by a mule, and a man getting his head bit by an alligator. Episode #3 includes a cheetah attach, a wild elephant, and a skiing dog falling down a mountain. Episode #4 includes an elephant getting electrocuted, a crazy bull, and a baby polar bear caught in a trap."
1,Wild animals video review,"A total dud! Not as impressive as shown on TV commercial. They show the same thing over and over, when they could have put more content of other interactions of man vs. animal, or animal vs. animal. It reminds me of how on Walker, Texas ranger, how they showed the same fight seen from different camera angles, giving the illusion of more fighting than was actually happening. There also is too much discussion by the narrator, when it is so obvious! It just eats up the time."
5,Splash cymbal rejoice,Connect this to a cymbal stand and attach the splash. Then start banging! Note the knobs will not come loose.
5,Five Star Rating!,This product is great! ...and finding it on this site is excellent it is all a Five Star Rating! Thank you!
1,Ah this is a tough one,Will I have red spots on my cheeks. so I thought this will help but unfortunately i was wrong. The good thing about it that it will keep your face nice and soft. But i will not remove or even reduce the redness on your face.So No i will not buy again and I do not recommend to anyone.
3,tuli heel with arch support,Item is ok. Gives some support. I would not spend any more money than what i did though. Don't feel support after awhile. Not sure how long will last.
4,a pair for every shoe,these are wonderful! help my back problems tremendously! they are very comfortable to wear and they stay in place (no slipping around)
5,great pocket knife,Excellent quality that comes in a very nice looking and feeling knife. I was looking for a pocket knife that wouldn't take up much space and this fits the bill perfectly.
1,"too much ""f"" wording for describing intercourse","I am not a prude but I found every story to have the ""f"" word and other slang words for genitals which I found degrading.Do you really mean to tell me 70 year old men and women speak that way? It is almost like porn and I threw away the book. One person wrote these stories and they are just that. I am a registered nurse and there was nothing in this book I found helpful."
2,Show is GREAT; Discs often don't play however!,I have bought a lot of DVD's of movies and TV shows and have never had discs that do not play in the DVD or just play when they feel like it. It is ridiculous.The show is GREAT...I love it but I am hoping that Season 2 has better quality discs!CarolineTired of Getting Junky Quality
3,Mad Men Season1,Merchandise arrived on time. Disc 2 will not play. I'm not sure if the problem is with my player or the disc.
3,Who knows why people do what they do?,"I finally got to see what all the fuss is about but I wasn't expecting Peyton Place. The acting is great and every word uttered is clever. Other than that, I found an assortment of mostly dislikable people in a 60s setting, with the negatives amped up to 10. Those who lived through the period will recall that much of what went on was not malicious, it was institutionalized. Like smoking, a lot of people just didn't know any better.By the second episode, as I watched the ad man falling from the building I thought, what a downer and as far as men and women are concerned, beneath the surface, how much has really changed?"
3,Mad Men DVD - Special Features,"Series was great, 5 stars!3 stars for the DVD only.Disapointed with most of the DVD Commentaries. Most are 2 or 3 cast or staff commentaries pieced together into one commentary which makes some of them VERY boring. VERY borng! There are a few good ones when two people are actullay doing the commentary together at the same time.Not too many other special features other than the commentaries."
3,Promise Unfulfilled,"Mad Men begins with such promise - interesting characters, good writing, colorful costumes, great setting -- and it maintains that quality through 2/3 of the first season, but then it begins to turn into a fairly routine soap opera, with some predictible twists ands turns. I would recommend the series, but the high hopes I had based on the uniqueness of the early episodes remained were deflated by the end of the season."
5,The extras are fantastic.,"I love this show, but I did not see all of the first year. I just finished disc one of season one and it was fantastic. 3 shows with a total of five commentaries. two for the first, two for the second and one for the third, rotating cast of commentators. There is also information on the musical scoring. This is a fantastic value and engrossing story telling."
4,Great show and the DVD.,If your a fan and you missed the first year or need to be able to look back and reference what has happened before then this for you.
5,Don't Miss This One ...,"As I approach my 50th birthday, I can honestly say ""Mad Men"" is the finest television drama I have had the pleasure to watch. For those of you who are tired of the horrendous offerings (reality and otherwise) produced by the networks and some cable channels, treat yourself to ""Mad Men."" The writing is superb and the acting phenomenal. Jon Hamm has movie star qualities the likes of which we haven't seen for decades -- reminiscent of those 1940's legends we so dearly miss. I don't typically write many reviews, but in the case of ""Mad Men,"" it is my sincere privilege to spread the word."
5,Finest few minutes on TV,"The impact of the few minutes of this scene in the ""Wheel"" is incredible. I not sure why this has such an effect, but I have viewed this several times and its has multiple layers of emotional effect that is uncommon from TV. The finest few minutes of TV is here."
5,Even better than the Sopranos,"Dry wit, tough office politics, bad behaviour towards women, mix in a dash of cynicism for good measure and you've got the best television series ever seen.Some episodes are so busy, it seems a miracle that that plots come together. In other episodes, nothing much happens. But what makes mad men so effective is the acting, pace and quality of the dialogue.I don't want to tell you anything more about it, for fear of revealing too much.You may think this is an over hyped series, but not until you sit down to watch it."
5,Sweet Series,This is a sleek and well made series I highly recommend for those who like amazing stories of the 60's. The wardrobe and makeup are perfection. Its sexy and interesting. The characters are very exciting to watch.
5,Addicting,"Thank god we stumbled accross this, somehow landing on it during the first show and were addicted from then on, really wanted to give the series to my Dad for Christmas so disappointed it is not available yet."
3,"5 Stars for the Content, 1 Star for the Blu-Ray problems","The show itself is magnificent, but I had problems with both Discs 2 and 3 (Episode 9 in particular was almost a complete loss.)I have a Playstation3 with the most recent firmware update. There is no excuse for this disc having problems!Now I have to write to Amazon and get both discs replaced."
5,the best! i must have the 1st season dvd.,"this was by far the best show in a long time. being close to the ad game, only added to my addiction. the bad news is i deleted from my dvr b/c i thought the dvd would be out as soon as the season was over. but no!!! stupid shows are released on dvd a lot sooner. i wanted to put this on my xmas list, but i can't.p.s. i'm still waiting for molly dodd to be released too! what's up with that?"
3,Good,"Mad Men, and its 21st Century drenched characters, is about as relevant to the 1960s as The Sopranos was to the real Mafia. But, that does not mean Mad Men is not compelling, and often excellent, television and fiction. It's simply not high art- although one might argue that its memorable opening credit sequence and lyricless musical score, by David Carbonara, are. Nonetheless, its consistent quality, in artistic and technical merits, makes Mad Men one of the best television shows of this century. And, given the narcissistic, deliterate, and self-absorbed state of this reality television era, that is no small compliment."
5,excellent condition and very enjoyable!,"Mad Men CD was very good, the CD was delivered in a timely manner, andit was in very good condition and very well packaged. Thank you."
4,"Amazingly great drama, but way too much sex","Wow, this is just about the best thing I've seen on TV. I watched the first season on DVD and couldn't stop. The characters are perfectly cast. The story is gripping, with surprising depth. ""Who is this Don Draper guy and why does he do what he does?"" is the question that keeps you watching. The pitch about the Kodak slide carousel was incredible, for example. And it's fascinating to see a glimpse of that long-gone world of 1960. I really don't understand the reviewers here who found the show boring.There is, however, way too much sex for my taste. Way way too much. Were people really that immoral back then? I don't know but I don't want to see it so explicitly."
5,memories revisited,It has the makings of a Mamet style with excellent plot development and outstanding characterization.
2,What's all the fuss about?,"Just another TV soap opera, this time with narrow ties and lots of cigarettes and booze. Poor writing, unbelievable characters, (especially the women), and a totally predictable plot. Watched one, that's one too many. Save your money and your time.For a great TV series, watch Treme."
2,Mad Men- Season One,"The movie came in a timely manner, but it skips about 30 minutes - 1.5 hour sections on the DVD. I am going to read about sending it back. Love the movies though."
1,"Great Show, Defective Blu Ray Disc","Everything they say about this show is true, but the enjoyment is spoiled by the fact that I've encountered a manufacturer's defect in the blu-ray version--near the end of episode 10, disc 3---there is a loud buzz for about 30 seconds. This occurred on both my original order, which I returned for an exchange. And, it is present on the replacement order which I just received. And I've had to submit a return authorization for a refund. Definately a manufacturer's defect--maybe in a certain batch produced within a certain period of time. I am surprised that there have been no other compliants. It might be wise to wait a while before purchasing. I'm very disappointed."
2,Anyone have problems with their Mad men Boxset?,"Got my set today 7/12, and played the first disc and watched the first two episodes and notice several visual glitches. The first two the picture seemed to freeze for a few seconds then continued on with the scene. The third one it look like a film strip broke and got stuck on the screen before continuing on . Anyone else have this problem?"
5,"5 star content, 1 star DVD operation","Very much enjoyed the first season of Mad Men. It really takes you back to the late 50's early 60's. Very good writing.On the negative side, it was extremely distracting with all the DVD problems. Disc 2 stopped 7 times, skipped quite a few times more. The second show of disc 1 was the same as was the second show of disc 3."
5,First Season is Addicting,"The first season of Mad Men is amazing! If you have come across any of the shows on AMC and are looking for how it all began than this is the DVD set for you. I started watching one night, and ended up staying up for four episodes late into the night. The acting is superb and the storyline is complex but easy for the audience to follow. Most of all the setting in the 1960's is so very different from today. This is evident by the clothes, actions, and set design; yet the emotions and conflicts of then are still very present and relevant to 2010. A must see!"
4,Solid episode.,We're given more clues into the enigmatic past of Don Draper. Betty's starting to lose it a bit too which is fabulous.
4,Best show on TV,Best show on TV. The cometary is quite good too and well worth the buy. If you've never seen the show start with this Blu-ray.
5,Mad Men Season One,This show is very entertaining. I love drama and it has lots of it. The acting is over the top with very talented people. I will watch the episodes over again.
4,Mad Men 1,I became a fan during season 2 and this is a great prelude to that! Can't wait for the new shows.
5,Great DVD set - great quality,"Arrived on time and was in perfect condition. Love this show! It is rich, dramatic, and well-acted. I can't wait to see what happens next in each eposide. A little cheeky in terms of the historical references, but overall a great show. Highly recommend."
2,personal opinion,it's well done from a technical standpoint but it shows such a misogynist society that I could not watch itThe way women are portrayed is horrible
2,Very disappointing packaging,"I love ""Mad Men"", and have wanted to start collecting the dvd sets for awhile now, but they have generally been priced higher than I wanted to pay. Imagine my excitement, then, when I found Amazon selling a new copy of season 1 for only $9.99- I was thrilled, but also cautious- there had to be a catch. I researched to make sure the packaging pictured on Amazon was the actual packaging for the dvd set- it was, so I placed my order. It just arrived yesterday, but instead of a boxed set with an episode guide, it's a black dvd case with 2 plastic trays inside to hold all 4 dvds. No episode guide, just the season 1 slipcover. It looks like someone put this together out of their home. I recognize I got a great deal, but if Amazon is not actually selling me the boxed set, then that information should be specified somewhere- I would have paid a little more to get the actual product instead of a homemade knock-off."
5,Addicting entertainment,"I'm a newcomer to Mad Men. I watched my first episode in Jan 2012 on Netflix. I'm totally addicted now and own all five seasons on DVD and am eagerly awaiting for Season 6 to be released. Well written, well acted, wardrobe, makeup hairstyles and set design are all very true to the time period. There is nothing cheap about this show. It never insults my intellect."
5,Mad Men Season One....A Must,"This is hands down the best show on television today. If you have never watched, please click the BUY NOW button and get crackin."
4,Mad Men Season One,"This DVD sets up the story for those who came late to Mad Men on AMC.The writing, costumes, and actors have brought the 60's back to life;Having lived through that era (as have many of you), I am enjoying areturn to those years - ""the more things change, the more they stay the same"""
1,Zzzzzzz,"I was excited to watch this series after hearing all of the positive critical buzz and Emmy awards stumbling all over themselves to give this show nominations. I was bored from the get go, but decided I would give it a season to be fair. After watching season 1, all I've discovered is that I've found a cure to my insomnia.The show is slow, horribly acted by stiff and uninteresting characters, and absolutely nothing of consequence happened during the entire first season. I will not be wasting my time or money on any future seasons. How the Emmy awards can give nominations and awards for drivel like this and completely ignore the far superior ""Friday Night Lights"" is baffling. I guess if you enjoy smoking, this would be a great advertisement."
1,sucks!!,This is the dumbest show ever. I dont know what all the hype is about this show.I was very dissapointed. HBO did a very good job by passing this show up.
2,Sad to see a show that glorifies drug use!,"Some interesting writing and acting ruined by use of the tobacco and alcohol drugs. Just as the movies are FINALLY starting to clean up their act with these drugs, this series comes along and almost tries to glorify them. Both drugs are weapons of mass destruction, especially tobacco. I'm sure the tobacco and alcohol pushers are happy with this series!"
1,useless,"Totally useless, because upon ordering this product it was not posted that it could not be used with my cd player. You refused to exchange it for me and I doubt if I will use your website ever again."
1,A review for Amazon,"Never buy a series or episode from Amazon if you own a Mac because it will not allow you to download your purchase. I am bitterly disappointed. Even when I am trying to watch it instantly through Amazon, the quality is absolutely terrible and will not run the way it should.It is better to pay a few extra dollars and buy this series through Itunes.Of course Mad Men is fantastic but Amazon instant tv ruins the experience of watching it."
5,Mad Men: Season One,"The best written series on television. The acting is spot-on, too. I recommend this series to anyone who appreciates adult entertainment."
5,Its nominated,Heard about the series got them for 10 each. i am grateful for the amazon with this fine gem of a show.
5,MadMen,I love this series. It can be addictive. It came quickly and was on sale. I am pleased with the purchase
5,Awesome!,"I watched this first episode of the series this past weekend. I did not watch Mad Men when it premiered in 2007, I'm a couple of years behind! In any event I've heard it has gotten rave reviews and I can understand why! It is great! I then went ahead and rented and viewed episode 2 as well. The same result. Now I'm addicted. I may have to buy the first two seasons on DVD."
2,"Give it a try, you may like it more than me.","Usually it takes a couple of episodes when starting a new season to really get to know the characters, their motivations and the plot. I like to give shows two or three episodes, but after the first episode of Mad Men I just wasn't that interested in finding out more. I know I'm in the minority with these opinions, so give it a try, you may like it more than me."
1,Yawn,"I can only guess at the reasons this dull show has gotten so much critical acclaim. My best guess is this: since most series feature everyone overacting to the nth degree and ham-handed cues telling us when to laugh or be emotionally effected, critics have begun to equate boring characters, long silences, and meandering conversations with ""good acting"" and ""subtlety"". There's a difference, people. Every episode is like a game of ""guess what I'm thinking"". Characters say and do seemingly random things, often wildly out of character--but we don't get to know why, we can only watch as the camera zooms in on them contorting their faces, not saying anything because ""that's how it was back then"". Yeah, yeah, whatever, the critics tell us that this is award-worthy work, but I'm not buying it. I'll stick to something that's actually interesting and compelling, thanks."
1,"Boring! really, really, really boring.","Four hours of my life I wish I could have back. Great acting, amazing costumes and sets; unfortunately not one remotely interesting thing happened the entire time I watched (well half watched- I kept falling asleep). Imagine transporting yourself back in time to an ad office and spying on the goings on there; thats all there is to this show! When I watch a show I like to be transported to somewhere more interesting, my real life has more going on than this show!"
1,the protagonist is a creep,"I finished the episode with nauseating contractions and don't want to download another one. The guy is a chain smoker (not that awful), unfaithful, no remorse creep. What a way to instill values when the protagonist, whose side of the story we are being told, is the biggest creep of all. Terrible for America!"
4,"Outstanding show, but normal packaging please.","Mad Men is an outstanding show, one of the high points of the 2007 season and the one I'm most looking forward to returning in 2008.I had planned to buy the DVD set, but I'm having second thoughts because of the box. It looksl ike it's going to be one of those odd-shaped boxes that looks like an old fashioned lighter. I get the joke, but I'd much rather have a normal box that fits on the shelf with the rest of my collection.I wish that when companies made these novelty DVD boxes that they also sold a traditional shape. Remember the ""Homer's Head"" boxes from the Simpsons Season 6?"
2,great series if you like men hating directors and writers,"NOT the fifties and early sixties that I remember. Two excellent scenes out of the whole season, the rest dreck."
1,The Emmy and strong reviews must reflect how BAD (perhaps MAD) most TV shows are these days,"We watched 2/3rds of the first season. All of the episodes were slow paced. Often excruciatingly slow paced. The show seems to be (really IS) mostly about smoking (mainly at work), drinking (mainly at work), and extramarital sex (mainly at work). Oh yeah - each and every character (including the children) is unhappy and behaving in a way that will lead them and those around them to greater unhappiness. Unless you are somebody who worked in this kind of environment and are looking for some nostalgia (and even then...), this show will not appeal to you."
3,Nostalgia Run Mad,"Mad Men is set in the time period of my parents. They do a really good job of portraying the attitude towards women and minorities in 1960 and beyond. People have forgotten what it was like less than 50 years ago. I am glad Mad Men can remind people how far we've come in a very short time and I hope it makes us grateful for the struggles our parents' (or grandparents') generation went through in order for us today to live in work places that should be free of sexual harrassment and racial discrimination - to say nothing of cigarette smoke!While I love the ambiance of Mad Men, the story itself I find boring. Certainly the writing is not as crispy as The Sopranos. I watch it for the time travel, not the plot. Is there a plot?"
1,Lifeless,"I began watching Mad Men hoping for an enjoyable experience, but, to my shock, found myself watching a story with a cast of actors that were dull and talentless and a script that was boring and inert. I can't understand why this show is so popular. Everything looks good, and Jon Hamm's handsome mug is always the center of attention, but there's nothing to get excited about. The third episode, with its cliched dialogue and clumsy performances, was where I had to stop.The only exception to the monotony is the woman who plays Peggy, the new girl at the office (and I'm sorry I don't know her name). Her acting seems effortless and she is brilliant, even when just standing still and looking around. She is the only gem in a sea of mediocrity. I'm done with Mad Men, and mad that it could have been so, so much better, but isn't."
4,Season 1 of Mad Men,It is great to get a used copy of season 1 at less money. I've watched all of the episodes and really enjoyed them.
4,Great Show - This BluRay has issues though,"My one and only gripe is the audio on this season. Seasons 2-4 have DTS-HD and work fine, but this season I need to turn my volume up to 35-40 to hear (12-18 is where it normally is for other DVD, Blu-Ray, and DirecTV)."
3,I Don't Know HOW To Rate This,"I grew up in the '60's. Watching this on Netflix, I was struck by how accurate the show is in portraying all that was sleezy about that decade. The casual smoking, the excessive use of alcohol, the sexism, the racism. It's a series that you will either love or hate. As for myself, I'm halfway through Season One, and I still don't know how I feel about it.Compelling. A very effective presentation of that time, that place. With central characters you may not care for..."
3,Misanthropic Candy,"All the darkest stuff from 1960 nobody talked about. Yes it's some of the best production values of any tv show in history. However, based on the 1st 5 episodes, I'm wondering why every character had to be so extremely unlikeable. Even the most naive women are narcissistic and self absorbed. The men are far worse. Tobacco and liquor companies must have financed 90% of this because it seems there's never 30 seconds without someone overindulging onscreen."
5,THE OPENING CREDITS ALONE ARE ENOUGH TO MAKE ME LOVE THIS SHOW!,"Four reasons to watch this:1. Jon Hamm is unbearably sexy.2. The sets, clothing and other depictions of the era are perfectly done but not overwhelming. They don't take on more importance than the story itself.3. The characters are complex, human, complicated. No one is a caricature or a cartoon. Everyone, even some minor secretary whose purpose in the show is to have sex with a major character, is shown as complex and human.4. The story lines are intriguing, compelling, multi-layered.There are some story lines that don't interest me: I get up and fold laundry or brush my teeth and floss anytime one of the kids are central to a scene. And I'm not interested in the horse-back riding life and intrigues of Betty. But those scenes don't dominate this fabulous show."
1,Was the wrong product,"I went to Kingston site and looked up my computer to order the correct ram. When I was redirected to Computer Brain, the specs for the memory got changed and they shipped the wrong stuff. After I got a RMA and sent it back, they charged me restocking."
4,Nice plane,"My 22-month old son loves this plane.We haven't had any problems with the rubber coming off the tires. The little elastic loop to hold the pilot in is too loose, so he falls out all the time, but I fixed this with a hair binder. Not perfect, but my son loves it, and now he asks 'help?' when he want the pilot out."
5,Old fashioned wooden toy!,"My grandson has been playing with this wooden airplane and pilot since he was less than 2 years old. He loves it -- runs around ""flying"" the plane. So much better for little kid fun than all those battery operated toys. He cannot however (still now at 3 years old) manipulate the elastic band to put the pilot in the plane -- too much fine motor control needed for such little fingers. But it's a sweet toy. Just be prepared to repeatedly put the pilot back in his seat!"
2,turbo airplane,"The item arrived quickly, but is not very sturdy for kids to play with a lot. Would have loved for it to be a bit bigger & tougher. My sons liked it OK, but wouldn't purchase it again. The rubber on the tires comes off very easily & is dangerous for kids to swallow. The pilot doesn't stay on very well either."
1,Not What You Think,"This book is advertised with a photo of a single page from the book, rather than a shot of its cover. The buyer is lead to believe that this book will help identify the hundreds of different models of Swiss Army knives sold over the years. It is a tragic misrepresentation. That ONE PAGE is about the exent of the books value to a collector of these knives."
1,Ear wax cleaner,The product was demonstrated on tv but it does not do what it was advertized to do. Poor quality product.
2,Seems cheap,"Not sure how it is suppose to work. No instruction included, not that I two year old couldn't put it together, but it would have been nice. I get a lot of water in my ears, and infections, so I thought that this might help line when I go to the doc. Not, you can hardly tell it is doing anything Would not waste my money on this again"
1,Doesn't work = won't turn on.,Defective = won't turn on. It's hard to like something that doesn't work out of the box. The case is of poor quality as well.
1,Not what I expected,When I ordered this I thought it would have been a better product. I was disappointed when I received it. It does not really work.
2,Don't waste your money,"I saw a commercial for this on TV and I thought I would look for one on Amazon....none of these really work or do what they say....it's a waste of money. However, this company did provide great service and I received the product in a timely manner...but, the product itself...full of boloney...not the sellers fault....I would order from this company again in the future."
1,It came with missing front part,"I hate it.It came with missing frontBecause when it arrived there was supposed to be two of them and then the one that I got had the front part missing, I ciulnd't do anything about it as I was so ill and then thought it was too late to do anything about it. However , I do think that they should send me another one that is altogether. This is the ear wax remover that I am talking about"
1,need more improvement,when i used it i caught a bad ear clog. it cost me a trip to the doctor the power of the wax cleaner is not strong to do what claims.
4,Ear wax suction kit,It did exactly what it said in the ad. My son has recurrent ear problems and it met our needs.
1,Does not work,"This product is a cheap piece of plastic. It does not come with instructions on how to use it. Once I put the tip on the end and turned it on, I realized it did absolutely NOTHING. It felt as if air was being blown into my ear. I thought maybe I was using it incorrectly, so I changed the tip and gave it to my husband to try. He also felt as if air was being blown into his ear. The filter showed nothing. This was an absolute waste of $14."
1,What A JOKE!!!!,this does absolutely NOTHING at all. it is basically a light with a fan. I guess I'm the fool for buying it
1,Worst product EVER!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I think that says it all. This item was the worst thing I've purchased on Amazon! I saw it or something similar advertised on TV and thought, why not, Amazon hasn't steered me wrong in the past; well, there's always a first time! They should remove this product from their website and cancel all orders! It doesn't do what they advertise NOR does it really seem to do anything but HUM, loudly! I threw it out it was so bad!"
1,Did Not Work,"We had high hopes of this item working, but it didn't work at all. Not enough suction to remove any wax."
1,Ear Wax Cleaner,"I bought the ear wax cleaner, because I hate using Qtips I know they are not good to use. I cannot find the right size batteries for it, so therefore I cannot use it. There are no instructions telling you they type of battery goes in it. I would appreciate an answer. Thank you"
1,Waste of money!,"This products does nothing to remove wax from ears. With chronic ear wax problems, we useSweet Oil/Debrox in ears on a regular basis. Both products are ear wax softners. Even w/theuse of these products, the ear wax remover does not remove a thing!"
1,bought ear cleaner for grandpa,really flimsy and cheaply made-I'll be surprised if it lasts a month-can't even tell if it is working as described
1,do not buy this.,it was the stupidest thing my husband ever bought!!!!!!!!!!! it does not work at all. you cant evan suck up water from a cup.
1,Junk,"Bad product, it doesnt works, top materials, made to last, I think a product like this will solve world peace"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,DON'T BUY-JUST A WASTE OF MONEY. DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. HORRIBLE PRODUCT AND SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM AMAZON. DON'T BUY IT!!
3,It's ok...,It works and all but when you turn it on and go to use it it really doesn't have much force to get the job done. :-/
3,Just okay,I ordered this to use on my dogs. Mainly to get little pieces of hair out of ears after clipping around the ear. It's not very powerful.
2,Works Well,"It does work well but not easy to clean. If wax and moisture are pulled from the ear, it is not easy to clear it from the receptacle."
1,EAR WAX REMOVER,THE EAR WAX REMOVER DID NOT REMOVE ANY EXCESS WAX FROM MY EAR AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY I INVESTED.
1,the worst product I have purchased in a long time,"EAR WAX CLEANERThis product did not work from the start, I bought this for my husband and it does nothing."
1,Horrble,My son has wax build up and it's difficult to get him to let us clean his ears. I bought this thinking it would be a great idea. I didn't do anything at all but tickle his ear from the vibrations. no real instructions to go with it either just how to put the batteries in and put the rubber nozzle on the tip.
3,"Promises, promises","I found this book disappointing and self regarding. Although promising to look at the 'new world', set aside from 'bricks and mortar', without concrete examples of his strategy, it remains wistful thinking. Connections and collaboration are fine - up to a point. When real money is involved one has to be much more certain of the pedigree of one's collaborators. I for one need a great deal more convincing.Until he has a successful business built upon his ideals, they remain ideals and should be regarded as fodder not fact."
2,"Very clever, but how practical?","There is no doubt that Peter is a genius and a unique thinker in the digital age. However, this book requires some huge leaps of faith as it is based on unsubstantiated assumptions.One also has to question Peters credentials for writing this book - what is his relevant hands on experience? He is an academic, a great thinker, but with little experience.A great book if you are the sort of person who can ask why and question the assumptions, as you will be capable of sifting the dross from the gems (which are there!)To summarise, if you want your ideas deeply challenged, and want to discover new outlooks on the new economy, this is a great book. If you want to actually create a viable business, be prepared to take a leap of faith."
4,"Important analysis, but somewhat long","This is a very important work, addressing a very important topic: Patient centered medicine. However, it is rather long, and at times, dense and slow reading.Strengths: Excellent cases, very thoughtful analysis. Includes a lot of theory.Weaknesses: Multiple authors makes some chapters more difficult than others."
1,The Dickens You say?,"Do not buy this DVD if you want to learn much about Charles Dickens 1842 tour to the Americas.Less than 15% of the dialog and video will actually be about Dickens.Most of this presentation is about the contemporary observations and opinions of M. Margolyes, who along with most of her interviewees are quite full of themselves..I gave up on this show after a passionate exhortation about the rooftop basketball court (with panoramic view) in a NYC jail; this was immediately followed by a visit to the Roosevelt Island insane asylum ruins. When a developer started explaining how the site was to be converted into modern upscale condos (not a bad idea I will admit) I threw the entire DVD collection into the trash (no I won't sell it to any of you suckers).The Dickens I say or at least I wish this was so."
1,Wow,"Not only is this book massively overpriced and full of information you could find in 5 seconds on Google (like all college textbooks are), but most of Chapter 6 is incredibly poorly printed."
1,Bad Seller!!!!,Paid for the book and never recieved it. Purchased this book for a class that I was enrolled in and guess what it never came. Not a single reply as to where or when it would be shipped. I tried to contact the seller multiple times without any reply's on where the book was. I have submitted for my money back from Amazon and hopefully I can get it back. Would not ever recommend this seller!!!!
1,Missing Pages,"I ordered a new book from Amazon few days ago. When I received it, it was missing five pages. They had been torn out. This book was advertised as new. Whoever orders this book or any other from Amazon should beware! I guess even Amazon can't always be trusted!!!!"
4,"Excellent resource, worth 19 bucks to not search the net","As with just about anything these days, you can either pay x amount of money for a guide to do it or search on the net for the info you need. While it is true that there is tons and tons of NWN world building info out there, it is always helpful to have a guide or reference directly in front of you to help you along.I have owned NWN since it came out and have build 2 modules since I got it before I bought this guide. Since buying the guide I have built another module that completely blows away either of my first 2 efforts. I highly recommend spending the money for this guide."
1,Poor customer Service,"I had placed my order with this seller over a month ago and still have not received my merchandise. I even emailed him hoping that he would respond and give me statues on where my order was but unfortunately he never contacted me. So here is my review of this seller, ""BUYER BEWARE"" you may not see your order for sometime, if at all."
1,A Crassly Opportunistic Waste Of Time And Money,"For those of you with little time, here's the short version: Do Not Buy.The content is badly-organised, the layout is amateurish, and all the information one might *really* want (function references etc) is just not present.The book walks you through the creation of a module, but it is hardly more elaborate than the built-in Tutorial you get in the Toolkit.My advice is, do Bioware's tutorial to get the basics of the Toolkit, and then read the many fine controbutions on the official Neverwinter Nights web site - there are also plenty of links there to sites that contain well-written, advanced tutorials and reference materials, and which are all FREE.Then, take your [money]you just saved and order in some pizza, because you won't be going out again in a hurry once you get into the Toolkit properly. ;)"
1,A Waste of Money,"This book was terribly written and poorly organized. It's difficult to follow, the tips come in the wrong order, and the examples often don't work. In addition, the book doesn't go into enough detail explaining terms and how and why things work. If you're not already a programmer, the book won't help you to learn anything about module creation. As a tool for getting started creating modules (which it purports to be), it's an utter failure. The authors often refer to their own module that they created, which you can allegedly download and use as an example, but as of December 2002, it still was unavailable. The section on monsters at the end is pointless filler that belonged in the adventure book if anywhere (even the tips the books gives are geared toward fighting the monsters, not using them in your adventures)...This book was a terrible waste of money..."
1,Poor Guide for World Builders,If your looking for a guide to building new modules for Neverwinter Nights this book is definately not for you. The book is so disjointed and unorganized that it lacks any real cohesive instructional value whatsoever. The beginning module builder would be much better off using BioWares excellent online tutorials both for building and scripting. The only value that this book has for the aspiring builder is the small Monster reference section but even these materials are available in the toolset.
5,Great movie!,Watched this Oscar-nominated doc the other night. It was fantastic - a great story and beautifully shot. Would recommend it to anyone.
4,Wow. Really Cool Story,"I didn't know a thing about this going in - just that a friend recommended it to me. Well, it was exceptional. Great, great story. Loved it."
5,One of the most inspirational stories you'll ever hear.,"Searching for sugar man is one of the best true life stories I've ever heard. Definitely give this film a try as I'm certain you'll be glad that you did. The principal character, Sixto Rodriguez, believing that the message in his music never found an audience ultimately learns, years later, that it did.See this film. Buy the music. You'll be happy that you did."
5,Excellent,I loved the story of an over-looked artist who had such an impact on an important social movement. The music is wonderful and the star is an enchanting character and artist.
5,so great,One of the best stories I've ever heard. An amazing look at a true artist and the impact on so many lives. This story embodies the way human beings connect through music and just how much it means in our lives.
5,Blue Coin,Lovely documentary of a true artist. Big thanks to the film makers and the seekers who finally tracked down Rodriguez. Bravo to the South Africans who knew a good thing when they heard it.
5,Unexpected Joy,"Loved this movie ,which is actually a documentary about a lost musical icon. It slowly grows on you and leaves you joyful and in awe at the spiritual dignity and power of one little known (to America) artist and his music. The spiritual dignity of this movie will haunt and grace your thinking for weeks if not longer. A must see."
5,Facinating documentary.,"A story of a regular man, an amazing poet with a lovely voice, inspiring millions unknowingly from across the globe."
5,A true prophet,"What an amazing story. It still seems like a fairytale, it's so hard to believe that this is a documentary. Having been born in South Africa in the midst of apartheid, and emigrating to the states, this movie brings an incredible perspective to me on so many levels, most profoundly: class inequality, social justice, art and industry, and the cruel irony that life often brings. How many more artists are in our midst with such powerful messages we will never hear? Most of all, this movie portrays Sixto Rodriguez with such humility and soul. Inspiring."
5,What a Story!,"This is the wondrous story of a young and talented musician, whose career tanked in his own country, but was, unknown to him for years, discovered and cherished in another country thousands of miles away. This film is witness to his rediscovery, and his uniting with his faithful fans in South Africa, where he had been, and endures, as a legend of classic proportions.It would have all be for naught, if not for the fact, that Rodriquez's music was, and remains today, so moving and evocative of his still gritty and frank point of view. Technically it's mature and well conceived in composition and melody. It still evokes after all these years.And his attitude to all this very recent attention is itself something to appreciate. He remains the humble and quiet laborer, and faithful to the life he has lived. The film gives one food for thought. It's unusual in this way, and well worth the purchase."
5,Perfect!,"What an awesome movie! Great story plus superb music with insightful lyrics. I rarely purchase movies, but this one I had to have!"
5,Beautiful!!,"Great documentary, very sad and uplifting at the same time. Great music. Hope that Rodriquez gets all the love and respect he deserves."
5,Amazing story; amazing man,"This documentary is well worth seeing, even though it leaves us with as many questions as it answered. Why didn't Rodriguez ever catch on in the US? I'm sure that with the help of this documentary, he'll finally get his due; South Africa was just decades ahead."
4,"Haunting music, touching story","Wonderful music and a touching story about a fascinating man. I could hardly believe this unique, talented person has gone unnoticed in the U.S. for so long."
5,Fascinating,"Especially his obscurity in the U.S., his fame in South Africa, and the ""follow the money"" mystery. Well worth your time."
5,a detective story that turns into what would be a fairy tale if it weren't true,"my wife and just finished watching and the first thing i did was send my son, a musician, an email that he should see this film. the story is amazing, a detective story that turns into what would be a fairy tale if it weren't true. it's remarkable and moving, and the music is the icing on the cake."
5,Searching for Sugar Man is the best film I've seen in years,"Not only is the story incredible and moving in every way, the filmmakers did an amazing job of illustrating the narrative with snippets of animation and an attention to visual detail that is rare. This level of artistry is rarely associated with documentary film."
5,Totally Redefines success,"This is a fantastic film - it all senses of the word: great, amazing, incredible, and completely unbelievable, even though it is true. The less you know going into this movie the better. Very briefly it is the story of a 1970's American song writer and singer who's album ""Cold Fact"" became wildly popular as the voice and heart of white South Africans against apartheid and government oppression. Little was known about ""Rodriguez"" other than rumor, until in one release of the album a challenge was made to 'Search for Sugar man.' If you like documentaries you'll love this film; if you don't you might love it anyways."
5,Inspirational documentary,"Wonderfully made documentary, inspiring look at the life of a true artist and his devotion to his music. Had me searching for Rodriguez music within minutes."
4,Searching for Sugar Man by Rodriguez,"We saw the documentary and love his music. It is amazing to me that he never has made the ""big time"". Somebody made some money off of him and he never knew. The words are raw but very true."
5,Great obscure music,"Album isn't consistently good but most of it is really top-notch and a window into creative, previously unknown 70s folk-rock."
2,poor reproduction quality,"I love the man's music and I have his two albums, but this sound track isn't right, sounds like background music...I'm not sure how to describe it, but I won't be playing it again .I've also downloaded the video and loved that too."
5,"Simply a great story, very well told","My wife and I were lucky enough to decide to see this film instead of one of the mass market blockbuster movies last weekend, after hearing about the movie on NPR. It is a documentary of a fantastic and uplifting story. A side benefit was being introduced to the previously not widely known (in the US) music of Rodriguez, which is quite my cup of tea."
5,This cynic was sold!!,"Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It's got great music, some interesting history and tells the story of a man who will reaffirm your belief in the goodness of mankind. Thank you 60 minutes for turning me on to this!"
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"Holt really conveys the attitudes, feelings, deep convictions, and courage displayed by those who fought in the war. (Not only on the Rebel side, but also on the Yankee side.) He also goes into some of the other reasons besides slavery, that caused the South to secede. Very well written and extremely interesting. It makes you feel as if you're right beside Holt following him as they go down in history. Also shows how life for the Confederate soldier was awfully harsh in the latter part of the war. Holt doesn't have shoes and is walking through snow along with men who are dying of starvation. Holt entertains readers by detailing what he and his group would do for fun, ie., sneaking away from camp to meet girls, etc.I knew Holt was in the 16th Miss. Co. K. I was hoping it would mention Co. H where my relative fought, but it didn't.Holt leaves for the war as a boy, but returns a man.Great book. I highly recommend it."
5,Made my husband smile!,This was my father in laws favorite music and we looked all over for this. My hubby was thrilled when I found it here!! Super deal too!!!
2,"well-researched, but poorly written","Kim-Gibson is able to gather the testimonies of many former Korean comfort women - not an easy task. Generally, the content of the book seemed to be excellent, but the writing was, at times, laughable. Kim-Gibson includes comments about her own feelings during her interviews of former comfort women, such as ""Relieved, I handed her a piece of Kleenex in silence."" Such irrelevant comments take away from the credibility of the book. They make it read almost like a cheap novel. If the writing had been cleaner, without having to listen to Kim-Gibson's experience (since this is, after all, supposed to be a book about the comfort women's experiences), it might have been a great contribution to the literature on comfort women."
5,Modern-day adventure story for both boys AND girls,"From the cover, this book looks as though it's just for girls, but there's a teenage boy in it, too (actually, there are two). These kids get in all kinds of trouble over a summer where they're in situations they don't like. I think this book shows readers that kids have more power and control over their lives than they think they do--and they can make a difference in the world, or at least their part of it. Great flying scenes, caving scenes, and other adventures keep readers turning pages."
5,Great video.,"All fans of the Mrs. Murphy series of murder mysteries will enjoy this video. Ricki Lake did a great job portraying the heroine, and the animals with their voice overs were very entertaining."
4,Corgi + Cat = FUN,"This is a great ""mystery"" that has both feline and canine detectives who assist their master in helping to both solve the crime and get the ""guy"". A must see if you are into mystery, felines and a good looking dog!"
4,"For all fans of Harry, Mrs. Murphy and Tucker","While the casting was not exactly ideal, the story line is all Rita Mae Brown. Harry solves another mystery with her pets and horses. She however, doesn't realize what help she has gotten from the two cats and one dog. This one is a pleasure to watch as it captures the spirit of the mystery series."
1,"Why, oh why . . .","The fact that this movie has a nice cast just can't save it from the usual Hollywood stupidity. They started with a perfectly good story, written by Rita Mae Brown and as part of her Mrs. Murphy mystery series, and changed it almost beyond total recognition. These books are not great mysteries, but they are always charming, full of great character development, and quick to read. The changes made in translating the story from the book to the screen were totally unnecessary, and especially jolting when you consider how many people have actually read the books. Why the producers felt they had to change the story, change the characters and their backgrounds, and many other things is beyond comprehension. This sort of thing should not happen, but it does much too often. When will Hollywood learn to listen to people who watch their movies?"
3,"Ok Movie, But Mildly Decieving Towards The Books","The movie is fine. Its the usual Disney TV fair, and is fine for the whole family. The book series on the other hand... Well, first off this is not based off of Murder She Purred, but instead Rest in Pieces. Sounds like a slasher movie doesn't it? Well in the original story it almost was. The books are very violent (I believe the book version of this had a severed head in a jack o lantern) and deffinatly not for children.Now I wouldn't have brought this up except for one small detail. At the end of the movie (at least when it was broadcast on TV) they plugged the books as family books! I mean Pawing Through the Past delt with gay rape, murder, and a transgender killer! The books are not for children, while this movie is. The movie is fine for kids, but keep them away from the books."
4,wonderful movie,"I just thought this was so cute. Maybe a little too cute at times and definitely cleaner than the books (which I truly love). Definitely a movie for the entire family. Took off half a star because Tucker is a lady. I took off another half star because Pewter was missing. Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie and I can even see Rikki as Harry (if I squint my eyes and get over it.) :)"
2,Cute...but not at all like the book...so disappointed,"Sorry...but I am a HUGE fan of Mrs. Muprphy and Tee Tucker and ""Harry"" Harristeen...and this movie did not do them justice. Ricki Lake, while cute, is not at all like Harry is described in the book (tall, trim, and athletic--she works her own farm for gosh sake!). But what really made me mad was the fact that Tee Tucker was made into a male. Tucker is very much a female corgi! I did not understand this switch of gender or its purpose. The movie, taken by itself, is a great family movie, yes. And I would recommend it as such. But, please, don't EVER refer to it as a ""Mrs. Murphy Mystery."" Shame, shame on Disney......"
5,Written Review,"This was a ""Christmas Gift"" for my 'Son and his Family'!They didn't use it as of now. Come Spring!Thank-You!Pat Bernhardt"
5,Great bike rack,"I have been using this rack for about 1 month. The rack was easy to assemble following the detailed instructions Thule provided. It affixes firmly into the hitch receiver and holds the bike securly in place with little or no front to back or side to side sway. As delivered, the two lock cylinders did not match,and the keys only fit one of the cylinders. I called Thule and they sent me a matching cylinder right away. I highly recommend this product."
3,Thule 4 bike swing out hitch mounted rack,"Had it 3 weeks works great, very easy to assemble, not cheap, pain that swing feature is not pull to release only, requires very large butterfly handle to be unscrewed and screwed everytime you want to open rear door. If you have SUV with glass door that can be opened separately from rear door I would recommend getting a flip down rack, less hastle ( pull to release only usually) to open rear door when bikes NOT on rack - no unscrewing and screwing - and when bikes ARE ON rack just use glass door for loading and unloading, that would be cheaper, easier and faster since there are more required rear door openings with bikes OFF than ON rack - hey we live and learn."
3,doesn't fit small bikes,"The rack is well built and I thought it would be a great solution for our RAV4 as the roof is a long way up to hoist our bikes. However, my 2 daughters' bikes, Specialized Hotrocks, 20"" and 24"" don't fit on the rack. I'd give the rack a higher rating if we could use it but it's off of our list for about the next 3 years."
2,"Poor sound quality, but good price for lots of features","Thought Uniden had a great reputation and bought this after a disappointing experience with Panasonic cordless (the answering machine on that one started malfunctioning just after the warranty expired). Have had this two weeks. The phone holds a charge. The ergonomics of the phone are great if you want something light to hold for long conversations. However, the sound quality is poor, even when you are right by the base station. It echoes and warbles. For this kind of money, they should work on the sound quality. It shouldn't be like a cellphone-type of calling experience."
1,Has nice features but it is not durable,"We were excited and happy when we first bought this phone through our phone company, but in 3 years the main button on the handsets has stopped working. Without that button working you might as well throw the system out (which we are). In fact, you can't even call out from one of the handsets. Very, very disappointed with the quality and durability.Our very first Uniden phone was great and lasted 13 years. That is why we bought this one, but I am not sure we will buy Uniden again."
5,"Fascinating story of 19th cen ships, great photo & drawings","This book deals with the development of steam powered ocean going ships during the Nineteenth Century. It is a scholarly work that draws upon extensive original research to tell this fascinating story.The ships studied here are paddle wheel steamers that still relied on sails as a secondary power source. The authors do a wonderful job of combining technical detail with anecdotal accounts of times aboard these ships.The main focus is on the seaworthiness of the ships, as the new propulsion systems created new problems in handling. In depth examinations of engines, paddle wheels and sail rigging are supported by many technical drawings.There are also many great photos & drawings of the ships at sea and crews in action. This book will appeal to both the student of maritime technology as well as the lover of seafaring lore."
4,nice,i dont remember much just that the 2/3 falls match was unbelievable! also the rock vs angle match was great! excellent ppv
5,Triple H/Stone Cold an rivalry of all rivalrys has finished.Thank God.,Ok Im glad this damn 3 or more year rivalry ended at No Way Out between Stone Cold and the Game.I was sick of seeing them headline every p.p.v with the same ol unfinished storyline next after next.So finally at No Way Out we finally got to see who the best man was fair and square.......and thats the Game Triple H.
4,WWF big event,"If you believe that the only step from wrestlemania was it only the royal rumble Whattt????For that in No way out The rock Vs angle For the WWF championshipthe winner would go to WWF wrestlemania X-7 to try retain the title against the winner of the royal rumble Stone Cold Steve Austin.Whaaattt??? do you think that this is the only greatest match but why hell no a 2 of 3 fall match Stone Cold vs HHH1st wrestling match, 2nd street fight and the botonline a # steel cage match.Many matches are too greats but this are the mo9s greatests so now try to buy your WWf no Way Out (2001) at amazon"
5,WWF No Way Out,"There was not a dull match on this ppv. It rocked. The first match which was a hardcore match between Big Show and Raven (As well as many others) started off the ppv with a bang. The I-c championship Fatal 4-way match was the best of its kind i've ever seen. Well there was 1 dull match it was the match with Jerry Lawler and Steven Richards. But the Stone Cold/HHH battle was epic and set a good mood for the rest of the ppv. I rate this ppv a 5 of 5 because it has everything 2 good hardcore matches,a fatal 4-way,a good catfight,and a pretty good main event."
5,Pleaase release this on DVD!!!!!!!!,"Why isn't this one ppv on DVD? This was the stup for the greatest ppv of all time, Wrestlemania 17! It was aslo a gret ppv in itself! Release this on DVD! Please?"
4,Good ppv,"This was a good ppv, I watched it in england, so i had to stay up all night. HHH v Austin was awesome, ROCK v ANGLe was also entertaining."
4,Love it!,"This is my favorite rhyming dictionary for songwriting. I've used it for about 12 years and am about to buy a second copy to replace my first one. The organization by vowel sound is nice and rhymes are also organized by number of syllables, double / triple rhymes, etc. Using this book in tandem with my Thesaurus, I've written many, many great songs."
4,good book,"words and connection don't always come out of thin air, often more times than not you have to put one and one together and make click in order to work and this book proves that point, very well connected and a cool insight to a job that alot of people do daily and have done, however written a song requires the balance of the words hitting in the right stride. very informative book."
3,very informational,i think this book gave me some helpful ideas and brought me to a succsessful conclusion.
4,The Blair Witch Hole Filler!,"Really excellently done. This two volume video contains material that fills in some of the plot holes in the other videos and books. Really a companion movie to go along with the books, this video was very well done in the same docu-drama style as the original movie companions and books."
2,Has Potential,"I tried to get into the Darkness for some odd reason. Some of the stories have potential and the art is good. But then it gets to wrapped up in being sexually gratitous. I mean c'mon a character who will die if he sleeps with a woman? I enjoy comic books, like Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and I adored the X-men in the eighties and Batman. But a lot of comics have gone down the drain, they rely more on drawing pinup girls then working on a solid, fun, entertaining story. Damn shame... Top Cow is guilty of this, and it's a shame."
3,"Pure folk, but only Bob is Bob","For those of you who want to love Bob, but have trouble getting by his, shall we say unique, vocal stylings, this CD will be a welcome addition to your collection. Yet what you gain in vocal clarity, you lose in all those intangibles that make Bob Bob. Bob has an edge. Bob is dangerous. Bob is brazen. Joan, God bless her, is the well-intentioned yin to Bob's raging yang. Having said that, the selections on this CD have been chosen with care, and Joan does her level best to do them justice. On the whole, well worth a listen, though I suspect many listeners will prefer the Dylan versions in all their strained glory. (If anyone knows if the poster that Joan and Bob flank in the liner notes is available anywhere, drop me a line.)"
3,Hit and Miss,"I've had this CD for a long time. On some of the songs, Baez hits the mark: ""Love is Just a Four Letter Word"" is perfect, ""Farewell Angelina"" is also not to be missed. On other songs, in particular the more up-tempo ones, well, lets just give thanks for the skip button on the cd player. In short, this CD is worth having just for the definitive version of a few songs. Buy the Dylan albums for all the rest."
5,A great read,"Hard to believe this is the authors' first novel. The characters are so alive... and the plot is outstanding. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read in the realm of Christian fiction. Evil among us is a well-written, hard to put down story; it seemed to provide just the right amounts of suspense. I loved every word. I eagerly await the release of the next book by this author."
1,"PC Games, Hoyle Card","If you live in Europe, don't waste your money on this program! I live in Spain, and the program will NOT load on my computer with Spanish language Windows XP. I was really disappointed because I enjoy playing Bridge on computer; if someone knows a card game program that will load, please let me know!"
1,Poor,Very average tape.The undercard wasn't really that good. Basically matches involving feuds which had died weeks ago. The main event was amazing.I prefer the real life action like that ultimate street brawls at streetbrawls.com at least that is real this It didn't last long but it was packed with action. If you like seeing finishers then there were plenty in the main event. There was only one title change but that title went back to the wrestler who lost it. The wrestler regained it on the following RAW
3,BETTER THAN LAST YRS!,This king of the ring was better than last yrs king of the ring!This is a decent show by the wwf the shane mcmahon match was pretty good.Slow start but dam well picked up with some spots u wouldnt beleive!I gotta give angle credit in this ppv as he had a few matches in 1 night!The main event was ok i guess!But if you are looking for a fast paced hard hitting wrestling show get wrestlemania 17 or summerslam 2001.If you are a collector do get this 1!!!!!!!If you are not i suggest hire before you buy!!!!
2,I WAS THERE!!!!,"Meadowlands East Rutherford NJ Continetal Airlines arena. The event would prove to be a big waste of $75.Most of the matches came off as very boring and dissapointing. The Taker/DDP was ok, and the Spike/Kane vs the dudleys was good, but for the most part it was really boring. The best match of course was the Shane vs Angle. I forget the outcome but when Angle tried to throw him through the glass windows that were the set for King of the ring, the first attempt failed and the glass didn't break and Shane hit the floor really hard. It's pretty dissapointing when the best match features a non wrestler! I was also dissapointed by the main event in which Jericho and Benoit basically 'swam' around the outside of the ring for like 10 minutes, way to kill time! The only thing that saved that match was a suprise run in.I'm not sure what's on the DVD, but hopefully it's not as boring as it was live."
2,One of the worst KORs,KOF 2001 was pretty lame. This DVD was a total waste of money and time. The reason I gave 2 stars is because of the Street Fight match between Kurt and Shane. This match was pretty brutal and worth watching. What a shame for WWE - the best match in the PPV was a match with a non wrestler. ...
4,booker t how dare you,"A pretty good pay per view especially for a king of the ring but that was probaly because there were no quarter finals and that gave more story for the other kotr participants.thought angle would become first 2 time champion or maybe ryhno to make his career even bigger.edge won and i thought it would be agoainst christian if one of the 2 got to the finals but was agaonst kurt.pretty good street fight between kurt and shane although kurt shoukld be fighting for major titles and not against shane. jeff hardy beat x-pac rules to retain the lightheavyweight title,jef got the cheers but xpac is the best guy in the wwf so he shoukld of won. main event wasgood excoept benoit got a neck ingury and booker t coming was great.austin retasins."
4,WWF King of the Ring 2001,"I attended the event live at the Continental Airlines Arena in NJ and the show was absolutely phenomenal, despite the absence of Triple H. I went with a few friends (we were in the 5th row, behind DDP)and the show reeked of awesomeness! The pyros and the atmosphere were unbeatable! Kurt Angle and Shane Mcmahon stole the show with their epic ""street fight"", while Edge started his push to stardom, and the Undertaker confronts DDP to defend the honor of his wife, Sara. There were a few WCW surprises as well. The Triple Threat match speaks for itself...Austin, Jericho, and Benoit gave it their hearts and souls and Benoit gave a little more...a few vertebrate. Great show and the DVD extras of the interviews with Shane and Kurt are tremendous. Any fan of the WWF should pick this up to add to their collection, I know I will."
1,Ths event [wasm!!!!,I was sittng in the 3rd row for this event and it BLEW!!!!You are better off renting this tape.The best(and ONLY)match worth watching was the street fight between Shane O Mac and Kurt Angle.The Main event finish was HORRIBLE!!!Save your money to buy INVASION when it comes out on video.
5,Great time for WWE Pay per Views.,"King of the Ring is one of my favorites to go back and watch on dvd. I collect all of these dvd, and this is one of the better ones."
2,disappointing ppv,"it wasnt the great ppv we thought it was , despite the stupid taker/ddp confrontation there were only seven matches ,the tag team title match and the light heavy weight title match were all boring ,nearly all the tournament matches were controversial , the austin/benoit/y2j wasnt great comparing to the build up to the match ,and although i am not an austin fan but the wwf made austin very weak in that match ,the only good match was angle vs shane and i only give the ppv two stars because that is what it deserves."
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY,This is probably the worst pay per view in WWE History. There is not a single good match on the card. I dont even know why I bothered to buy it. The Undertaker and Triple H Match is not even close to being good. That match would have been a good main event for Sunday Night Heat. The Rock did nothing special that night either. WARNING: DO NOT BUY
3,King of the Ring Average again,"I love anything of the WWF, but this ppv did not cut it. I liked it none the less, but the main event failed horribly to deliver, the triple threat match is very slow and boring, and the ending is terrible. The other matches were good though, especially the Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon match, and Undertaker DDP confrontation could have been saved for Raw. This ppv is nothing to talk about. But if you like wrestling it is for you, I mean hey, I'm gonna buy it anyway."
3,Le meilleur album de garage depuis MéD,"Cette album est tout simplement génial, rien d'autre à dire.Des rythmes envoutants vous font oublier sur le coup que l'album à un son terriblement mauvais et de basse qualité et on dirait qu'il à été mixé dans une salle de bain dont la toilette était bouchée.Mais qu'importe,si vous faite un tour au dollarama près de chez vous,prenez une gogosse qui glisse dans les mains mais rajoutez dans votre panier un pack de chips cheaps, de gommes balounes dures, de tetous fait par des Éthiopiens maltraités.........et le disque Drum-and-chose de Mellowtron, le seul groupe à égaler MéD, la famille Daraiche, Prof et cie et Canned Hamm dans l'estime des plus grand amateurs de musique."
3,No luxury in Sateen,This sheets are good in terms of size and fabric. But the color no longer remains luxurious and looks like any other 400 thread count sheet. But at cheap price definitely a choice.
2,mild physics for surface fliers.,"Physics EASILY told, (NOT explained). Too few del:s and poissons forced me to cry for help from physicists. How low could a student in electronics go"
4,The importance of the last page.,"One of those books that one reads just for the sheer enjoyment of reading.It made me laugh at several instances - a religious satire, indeed. And marvelously amusing!The conspicuousness of the spelling mistakes made me believe they had a purpose, although not a clear one to me. The uniqueness of the syntax, on the other hand, won me completely.A true meaning, one that I never expected to find in this book, I came across within the last few pages. If we consider this the Bible - since it is about Jesus, anyway - then the ""New Afterword"" is the Revelation. It wouldn't be the same without it!"
3,A Portrait of Jesus as a Young Zinester,"Do you enjoy spending afternoons in coffee shops? Do you like to look through the zines that they sometimes have in their ""free"" section? Are you often disappointed with the selections? Do you occasionally find something worthy of your time, not exactly a masterpiece or anything but with writing that's decent enough to entertain you until you've reached the bottom of your cup?Do you ever wish the zine was written by Jesus Christ? If so, this is the book for you.Jason Roger's novel is told primarily from the point of view of Jesus, with occasional interludes from literary icons and often the author himself. Roger's unique presentation makes the book resemble the typical zine. Only instead of using collage, he uses things like wingdings, different font sizes, and footnotes to achieve a similar effect.Tomorrow Nothing is a fun read and will please fans of religious satire."
2,Unsettling,"I looked forward to this collection and was disappointed with it. The stories had a nasty, bizzare bent. There were three stories I liked, but the rest were strange. That said, if stories that end darkly and leave you with a feeling of despair are what you're looking for--you've found it."
5,Inspired cooking,"A beautiful culinary experience! The photos are stunning, the stories are wonderful, the food is delicious. I have my favorite recipes that friends request over and over - Chocolate Chili Pots and Navaho Peach Crisp to name a few. Everything I have tried has turned out simply wonderful. If you are lucky enough to experience the restaurant this cookbook is based on, Hell's Backbone Grill, you are truly in for a treat - Jen & Blake are wonderful hostesses and will make you feel right at home in their remote part of Utah. Getting this cookbook and making the trip to Boulder UT are well worth the investment!"
5,Terrific Book - more than just a cookbook!,"First I read the book through and was entranced by their story, the stories of the people in the community, and the gorgeous pictures. Then I started on the recipes. The first ones I tried came out perfectly - and perfectly delicious. Very unusual combinations that everyone loved. The Christmas Posole was a lot of work, but worth every minute spent on preparation. Now I've decided I want to go through the entire book and make everything in it. I am not much of one for cookbooks, but this is the exception for me."
4,The only pen I buy!,"I love this pen; it's the only one I buy. Problem is, it's very hard to find. Recently I've only been able to buy it here on Amazon, and I've noticed that the price keeps rising. Now $70! Ugh!The pen's many good features include its very nice clip. Wonderfully designed with a fused ballbearing that makes it gentle on fabric. The grip is also very nice, although it has a peculiar habit of occasionally becoming mishapen. But I've generally been able to remedy that when necessary.Overall, this is the pen for me. Once in a while when someone asks if I have a pen I can use, and I hand them mine, I hear people rave about how much they like it -- and don't want to return it to me!"
3,Wrestlemania 17 Good but wasnt the best,I personally believe that this event was good but it damn not no 5 stars and damn sure not the best wrestlemania of all time. i saw it like 5 times. and when i ordered it on ppv i was kinda disappointed on how the matches went. this is good but i was disappointed with the rock and austin match. it was good but it was bret vs austin all over again. i was disappointed bout alot of stuff on this event if you ask me the best match that stole the show was the benoit and angle match. if those want to know the besy wrestlemania of all time is in my book wrestlemania 14.
4,Very Good Wrestlemania,"This was a very good wrestlemania, but the only problem was austin turned heel. Some say that was cool, but others like me hated it. It started the what chant so now no one can talk. It had it other moments to though. If it was so good then why are they out of stock or can't they sell it because it has wwf in it. I need that answered quickly because I want to buy it."
2,Disapointment,You would think that a big pay per view like Wrestlemania X-Seven would have a bad ass DVD right? WRONG!!The good thing about the DVD is it has the Sunday Nigh Heat xtras but the downfall to the whole DVD is they split the matches in the DVDs!!! The First 8 matches are on the first DVD and the last 3 are on the second DVD. What the hell were the people who made this damn DVD Thinking!!! Bad choice!! Waste of my money !!
2,the worst ppv ever,wm x7 was not good there was only a few good matches the tlc2 would be the only reason for buying this. and the vince vs. shane match. the rest of the ppv was no good if you watch wwf you will be abel to predict what will happen except for when austin joined vince the rest sucked .
3,almost a 4,"the rock vs austin!booooooooooooooooooo!shane o vs vinnie mac.these 2 always do something memorable.this match rocked!triple h vs undertaker.guess who won this one?the tlc 2 match!tables,ladders and chairs.this is one of the 20 greatest matches of all time!maybe top 10!a great old schoolmatch between angle and benoit voted into the top 10 wrestlemania matches ever by the wrestlers themselves.the gimmick battle royal kind of sucked but it was cool seeing all the guys from the 80s back.there was a so so match with ysj and regal.a chick match.there always fun.another good match was the 3 way hardcore match involving raven-the big show and kane!then theres a snoozer between eddie guierro and test.and another snoozer of a tag team match."
4,"Great event, poor dvd","While Wrestlemania X7 itselt was a great event - the crowd really got into it which motivated the performers - there's nothing ""special"" on the dvd - no audio commentaries, no alternate angles, no exclusive backstage happenings - other than an interview with chris benoit - no hidden tracks. The specials consist of Flashbacks - which they show during the event anyways - the X-Factor pre-Wrestlemania match from heat - there was a reason this wasn't on Wrestlemania itself - and other assorted clips from ""Axxess"" which were all shown on Sunday Night Heat.Even though there was nothing ""special"" on the DVD version, the event itself was fantastic, and when you combine that with dvd quality picture and sound, its enough of a reason to buy it."
5,Best Wrestlemania EVER,Ill just name some of the better matchesChris Jericho vs Willam Regal GREAT OPENERHardcore title Kane vs Raven vs Big Show HARDCORE DOESN'T DESCRIBE ITKURT ANGLE vs CHRIS BENOIT YOU LIKE AMATEUR WRESTLING ITS FOR YOUFather Son Street Fight UNBELIEVEABLETLC 2 OH LORDUndertaker vs HHH Long but goodAustin vs the rock TOO long but good
5,best wrestlemania 17 of all time.....,"wrestlemania 17 rules because the match of the night was tlc 2 and rock/austin duel 11 of the greatest matches ever overall the ppv was cool buy this video its 4 hours of mayhem and the astrodome in houston tx was loud 67,000 plus were there see ya.."
1,He sold me a bad DVD!,"In 3 different spots of the DVD, it froze up and I had to completely restart the DVD over, and over again just to see the rest of it! The parts that I missed were very critical in this DVD! Don't buy any thing from this guy, he will send you BAD merchandise!"
1,"Great PPV, Poor DVD",Couldn't believe that I had just bought the DVD of possibly the greatest Wrestlemania of All time!! But I was really disappointed when I saw it! First of all there were no alternate commentaries! Not many xtras as you would think! They split the PPV onto two dvds!!! First 8 matches on the ... first DVD and the last 3 matches on the second ... DVD!!! Poor ... Job on making the ... thing!! Vince should fire who came up with the idea to make the DVD this way!!!
5,Wrestlemania X7 ROCKS!!!!!!!!,"This has to be the BEST Wrestlemania I have ever seen and I've seen them all! The highlights of the show for me were the TLC II match, Chyna vs. Ivory and Stonecold vs. The Rock. However, my favourite match of this PPV has to be the Shane vs. Vince Street Fight. I have one word to describe this match...... AMAZING!!!!! How Shane manages to pull off the ring post-to-ring post drop kick I will never know!!! The other 'action' during the match was good and helped refresh the McMahon storylines. Can't wait for the next PPV and the re-launch of WCW!!!!!!!!"
4,Pretty Good PPV,"I was at Wrestlemania X-Seven and it was a pretty good event. McMahon said that it was the biggest Wrestlemania ever. I disagree with that, but it did have quite a few good matches. With the exception of the Benoit/Angle and Test/Guerrero matches, it was a good show. The Triple H/Undertaker, Kane/Raven/Big Show, Shane/Vince and TLC II matches were defintely the best of the night. The rest of the matches were also very entertaining. All in all, a good PPV. If you're a WWF fan, you'll probably enjoy this. It was however missing two things, Jerry Lawler and The Kat."
5,Houston...We Have The Best,"Wrestlemania 20 nears, and looking at the first 19 Wrestlemanias, this was arguably the greatest. I only own two wrestling DVD's: The Ric Flair Collection and Wrestlemania X-Seven. And so far I'm satisfied from investing in the two best. On one hand, yes, this DVD has a few pointless extras, but it doesn't matter. The pay per view itself is one for the ages. A superb lineup that has a little bit of everything which should please any type of wrestling fan (yes, even a traditional short DUD). And that's the bottom line! you know the rest..."
5,it's amazing...,"Wow, just by watching the introduction to the PPV you know this one is going to be amazing. The people are screaming their throats out, and you can feel the greatness of the WWF. All matches are great, but my favorites are Benoit vrs. Angle, the TLC2, HHH vrs. Undertaker, Reagal vrs. Jericho (to short though), and the main event, this one is just breathtaking, the Rock and Austing gave everything in this one, surprising ending, exellent PPV. It's a must have."
5,The greatest pay per view ever,"This is the greatest pay per view ever. Ever match was entertaining. The matches witch stole the show was the Mcmanon vs Mcmanon street fight, TLC 2 of course. The Triple threat Hard core match, Undertaker and Triple HHH and finally a bloody battle between Austin and the rock. This movie is a must buy for any fan."
5,Good God! Good God! Good God!,"The Best of all time. I had the pleasure of attending in person. Every wrestling fans dream is to attend a Wrestlemania and mine came true. From top to bottom a great card. My favorite match was the Stone Cold VS. Rock match. Of course, being from Texas, I was going for Stone Cold and booing the hell out of the Rock. It was a thrill to see all the old-timers again. I wanted Hogan to make his triumphant return(I was wearing a ""Hulkster"" T-shirt for those who have seen the video)but unfortunately it did not happen. Anyway buy it, if you dont your a jabroni. THE BEST OF ALL TIME!!"
5,Wrestlemania ROCKED,This year's was a lot better than last year's. The opener was ok. I liked the hardcore match it was pretty cool. The t.l.c 2 was a really great match. Undertaker and triple h match was a great performance between these two superstars and keeping Undertaker's streak of wins at wrestlemania. The main event rocked the dome and I thought it was the greatest match between these two. A really cool pay-per-view.
5,the best,the wrestlemania was the best ever it was the turing point of the wwf/wwe.It was one of the last time that wwf superstars were all toghter.
2,Book Falls Into Trap Familiar to Baby Boomers,"This book was a major disapointment and waste of time. Instead of providing interesting insights and data on young adults (25-35), the author instead decides to talk about her own generation, the Baby Boomers. As a child of Baby Boomers, I'm quite aware of the impact their perceptions had on me; however, this book focuses too heavily on the my parent's generation and how they influenced my generation. In my opinion, the author has fallen into a problem many Boomers have - a tendency for self-absorption and selfishness. When she does get to talking about the subject we are all interested in, the talk becomes a familiar litany of divorce rate statistics, overexposure to television and my generation's supposed cynical outlook on life. Skip the book and use the money to buy a meal for your favorite ""Generation X'er"" so that you can ask them the questions you're looking for. The results will be more accurate than anything in this book."
1,"Survivor Series, huge disappointment","Jeez, I remember watching this one and nearly falling asleep on my couch...the only match worth watching is the Austin vs. HHH with a sweet ending...I gave this one star because Amazon wont allow me to give it 0"
5,WWE Survivor Series,"1.Intergender 6 Man Tag MatchT&A; & Trish vs Steve Blackman,Crash Holly & Molly Holly5/102.Elimination MatchK-Kwik,Road Dogg,Billy Gunn & Chyna vs The Radicalz7/103.Chris Jericho vs Kane9/104.European ChampionshipWilliam Regal(c) vs Hardcore Holly4/105.Rock vs Rikishi10/106.Womens ChampionshipIvory(c) vs Lita0/107.WWF ChampionshipKurt Angle(c) vs Undertaker10/108.Elimination MatchThe Hardy Boyz & The Dudley Boyz vs Goodfather,Bull Buchanan & Edge & And Christian8/109.No DQ MatchStone Cold vs Triple H10/10 (Match Of The Night) (Crazy Ending)Overall60/90"
4,Great Way To End The Year For The Classic Five Pay Per Views,"This PPV was very entertaining. The WWF title match was good until a huge screwjob is pulled off and leaves you angry and ticked off at Angle. The Rock match is ok, but some of the actual Survivor Series matches are entertaining as well. But, the main event is awesome. Triple H up against Stone Cold Steve Austin, this match is very good. Austin, although being out of the ring for a year, gives a knock out performance with some funny moments as well.(When HHH is down, Austin sits down on the stairs and drinks a beer. The ref looks at him and Austin yells:""What do you want?! Im thirsty!"" Then, the end of the match is probably one of the greatest acts of He(( Raising ever accomplished by the Rattlesnake. What is it? Buy it and find out!"
2,wwf survivor seris 2000,ok ppv three best matches stone cold vs. triple h no dq undertaker vs. kurt angle rock vs.riskish i enjoy the stone cold match because i'm a stone cold fan undertaker vs. kurt angle was the best match dumb ending rock riskish vs. rock ok match slow pasted riskish after the match bonizi drops rock three times and injures his ribs more from when riskish hit rock with the sledehammer ok PPv would not buy it for the stone cold match
5,This book is great for children .,This is a wonderful book for hispanic students or students learning about different cultures. It includes great pictures and factual information in a non-threatening way. Great addition to personal library.
4,Impressed with Tissot,"This was my first Tissot watch and I'm impressed. The packaging is spectacular... comes in a handsome box and includes a 200 page booklet on Tissot's history. The watch itself has taken one of the top spots among my other 26 watches, with it's weight and heft, attention to detail, build quality and accuracy. I get more comments on this watch than most of my others. I'll be hunting down more Tissot's in the future, based on my experiences with this one."
5,Very nice watch,"Happy with watch, but would have liked an instuction booklet which was not included."
4,"Good text but there is a better, less expensive one","Business Communication: Process & Product is an excellent but very expensive book. It is a self-contained system for teaching business communications to students with step-by-step instructions, lesson plans, overheads, PowerPoint presentations, assignements, and assessments. Students will learn how to develop effective memos, e-mails, business letters, reports, proposals, and resumes. They will also be given pointers for better oral presentations and interview techniques. Ellen Guffey produces a similiar book called Essentials of Business Communications. It has a soft cover, basically the same information and teacher/student support, and sells for $45 less. It contains more reference to real company situations and humorus cartoons for increased reader interest. In my opinion, this book is the better option of the two."
3,"Expensive, Bloated, But Useful","This textbook is expensive. I think the price is absurd.However, the information contained is worthwhile. Guffey could have condensed a lot of material.Things that work in the book's favor are the checklists at the end of sections and a summary of the chapter. Small useful side menus abbreviating useful terminology or steps are littered through out the book; and they are worthwhile to review and use.Condense the text and make it more affordable. I say to Guffey stop aiding Publishers the in grifting of student's pockets."
5,In time,My book came to me two days before my class started. It was in the condiction that was stated. It was in better condiction than the books in the bookstore on campus. Thanks for being speedy!
2,"Unless you have no common sense, dont get this book","Wow, talk about an insult to intelligence. When you read this book you say ""Duh"" as you read it. The online quizes coulde be helpful, but using a character called ""Answer Man"" makes you feel like you are in first grade. If you really feel you need help with your writing skills, don't get this book. Try something else, anything else, but this book."
2,dry and uninspiring,"One would hope that the title implied a book particularly slanted towards real-world practitioners. But the book essentially only offers standard introductory material. And it does a poor job at that. Despite starting out with the basics, the text tends to be dry and not particularly descriptive. There are too many examples - often verbose & repetitious - that simply give numbers for direct plug-n-churn into a preceding equation.Another big problem with the examples is that they are without exception about things like ""stream erosion"", ""foundation settlement"", or ""water evaporation"". Such unfamiliar and inherently ""soft"" notions just add extra unnecessary cognitive impedance to understanding the main object of an example. I'm sure this is true even for a 2-nd year Civil Eng student."
5,"best ""instant"" udon I've had","Having sampled a variety of both dried and instant type udon noodles I have found that Myojo's are some of the best. The noodles are always pleasantly textured and the flavor packets are tasty, but not so overpowering that you can't add things to your soup to make it a meal. (seafood, vegetables, miso, seaweed, etc) Pricing is very good on these as well, and with amazon's free shipping they are far more affordable for me than driving 100 mile round trip to the nearest large town with an asian grocery that carries them."
1,Completely Useless rubbish!,"I wasn't expecting much for the price. But this is a useless piece of garbage by any standards.I assumed the ""voice effects"" would be about the quality of a kids megaphone toy but were not even that. Just garbled static and changing the settings does not change the voice effect.At least with the kids megaphone voice changers you can somewhat distinguish whats being spoken, this thing literally just puts out static and ground loop noise. Voice changer is useless ( and I like lo-fi sounds, this is NOT lo-fi it is useless.)And the ""sound effects"" sound even worse than one off those toy sound fx key chains.And its grotesquely noisy even when your not using it.Stay away from this and from what Ive read all GLI products.This is 99cent store toy disguised as DJ equipment.And I had to pay return shipping to get my money back.Just get one of those megaphone voice changers for $9 and tape a mic to it, thats what Im going back to doing, sounded way better than this crap."
5,Second buy!,"My mini schnauzer loves it! It makes sounds and attract him, but not too noisy like those squeeze ones. It is colorful and cute. But the best is that it can be thrown as a fabric Frisbee. My puppy learns jump and catch with this toy. The color fades a little and he bites off a little of the fabric over the year so I'm buying a second one."
2,play or not to play,"really cool toy for a puppy, my chihuahua loved it when she was really young but she got tired really easy of it, i had to give the toy away. really good material and colors are a little more opaque in real life."
1,Beware!!!!,"If the above information is accurate, that means this DVD is only a transfer of the VHS (which I sent back as soon as I received it 3 years ago) where about 2 x 15 minutes are missing : the runtime for these movies (english & french versions should be around 150 min., and not 120 min. as shown in 'product information'.Of course my rating doesn't apply to the movie, which is the ONLY ONE where one can listen to Feodor Chaliapin Sr.'s voice. When the nerds pretending to enforce copyrights are going to understand that butchering movies is the worst offence? Or maybe they only want to enforce crooks' rights, and believe customers have only the right to be cheated!!!!!"
1,Not the quality expected,"I purchased these sheets after having owned a set of Wamsutta sheets previously and being extremely pleased with their performance. However, these sheets(with a much higer thread count than my previous Wamsutta sheets) have pilled all over the fitted sheet, making it feel bumpy and uncomfortable, all within 3 weeks of purchase. My recomendation is to go to another brand, even though the price is good on this high of a thread count,I guess there is a reason the price is low. Poor quality. I am really dissapointed, I trusted the Wamsutta name."
1,Don't buy,"It lasted only a few months. And I used it a very few times. The connection between the jar and the blender base is made of plastic. It simply disintegrates.Don't waste your money, buy an Oster: five years of use now, no one problem, all made with metal parts and not plastic."
1,Not made for the long haul.,I have barely used this blender and this morning while making a smoothie with ice cubes small plastic bits started flying out from under the blender. Half of the piece that turns the blade had completely broken into pieces. Save your money.
1,HORRIBLE!,Pro's: Inexpensive. Solid Glass container. Many speeds.Cons: Fatal flaw is that the gear and gear-mating mechanisms are made of highly breakable or meltable plastic. Numerous times the gear on the bottom of the blender has melted away from the nut attached to the chopper-blades and has had to be re-glued.NEVER Buy this Blender. You will be sorry. Marlan Knittel
1,Crap by any other name is still Crap!,"I used this piece of junk 6 times and on the 7'th it rested - permanently. It just stopped working. No motor blow up, no plastic flying nada - it just died. I expected better because of B&D's reputation with power tools. But this was a total waste of time and money."
4,black and decker crush master blender,The blender works well. Per the picture I thought I was getting a glass jar instead I got a stainless steel jar. The blender does work well overall I am satisfied with the product.
1,Does not work right out of the box.,I got this blender as a gift. I opened it and put some frozen fruits in it to make a smoothie and plugged it in. Ouch...the blades are'nt moving at all....This blender was dead right out of the box....Black & Decker has its reputation in trouble thanks to this blender....DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK !!
4,I Loved it...,"I have had this blender for several years and loved it. Never had any problems. Alas, one of the reasons I bought it was because it had a glass jar which I prefer to the plastic. A couple of weeks ago I banged it royally against the sink while washing it and well... of course it broke! My only complaint is that it lasted so long I can no longer find a jar replacement. Bummer."
1,Absolute Trash,I thought this blender because the Box said it could crush ice but it hardly does. The ice is chunky and ruins the smoothie. It does get the job done with fruit so if you don't need to crush ice then its not bad for the price. Id say spend another 30 bucks more to get a better blender.
1,Good at making SMOKE,I have owned this blender for 2 years and it never really worked great but the one I had before it had a plastic container and never cleaned well. We use the blender very sparingly over the time we owned it mostly for ocasional smothies and mixed drinks. Today while making smothies use juice and frozen fruit it died. It started making some loud noises then slowed to a crawl before smoke started coming out of the base. Garbage. It was easly used less then 30 times.
5,It is great like a work horse!,"I use this item to make smoothies. It should not be called an ice crusher. It does crush ice, but it isn't all it does. I make smoothies with Kale, spinach, frozen fruit, ice etc.every day and it works great! I would buy another."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BLENDER!!!!,"I bought this blender on April 11th, 2007. Today is May 29th, 2007. I used this blender everyday. I liked the blender because of its powerful motor and its function to crush ice.Yesterday while I was using the blender this really loud noise started up and then all of a sudden small plastic bits started flying out from under the blender. I turned off the blender and turned it over - the adapter piece that connected with the blender base, the piece that turns the blade, had completely dissintegrated.When I inspected the blender base I realize that it was made out of plastic!! Cheaply made - worthless. Do NOT waste your money on this.I went out this morning and bought an Oster. One with metal parts and not plastic."
1,Mine stopped working too,I purchased the blender new and used it for about two weeks (only the puree function) and last night it just died. No apparent way to revive it.
1,1 week and done,I bought this blender on a Sunday and I used it every morning to make simple smoothies(Frozen and fresh fruit without ice). The motor was very loud compared to other blenders I had in the past. Friday morning I woke up and started my daily smoothie routine and this time the motor was louder than usual and the blade wasn't moving at all. I tried re-positioning the container but got the same loud motor and no blade action.My end result was a lumpy smoothie in the container and black plastic particles in the blade section. I do not recommend this blender
1,Mine broke too,"The plastic gears under the base of the metal blade are broken after very little use.I've searched Black & Decker website, but cannot find any replacement parts.After viewing the Amazon comments, this model should be recalled."
1,Terrible,This blender does not blend well. Crushing ice is a joke....I spent a long time and still had cubes in the container.
1,Caution,I purchased it and used it just once to make a puree and just after 15 minutes tried using it again and it was dead. It was not working at all. I saw BLACK AND DECKER and purchased it.It is most unreliable.
4,Disney's Pluto,I'm a fan of animation. And what collection would be complete without the Disney shorts from times past. A most enjoyable diversion with educational special features. The shorts are charming just as Disney intended. Not as edgy as the Warner Brothers/MGM bunch but they did occupy a different market nich.
5,"Get yours quick, this one is actually more rare than most...","I just picked this up today, and I haven't even started watching it yet, so I apologize for not reviewing the content.I did, however, notice that the 'Certificate of Authenticity' states that this set is limited to only 65,000 copies.This is one of the most limited pressings of all the 'Disney Treasures'The valuable 'Goofy' collection was limited to 125,000.Geez, they made 250,000 copies of 'On The Front Lines'!!"
5,One of the Essentials,"Never before available in a comprehensive collection. Images and instances from early, classic Disney cartoons have been referred to, referenced and utilized for innumerable licensed products, fine art, current entertainment in all media as well as at the theme parks. In addition, they remain terribly entertaining. What more can you ask for?"
2,Too much sugar,"This is supposed to be a diabetic cookbook. There is too much sugar in the recipes. Also, the book is outdated and calls for ingredients that are no longer available."
1,DESSERTS NOT FOR DIABETICS!,"This book is surely NOT for diabetics. Every single recipe calls for sugar, sugar, sugar! I returned the book."
1,Worthless on all levels!,"This recipe books represents the worst of both worlds--sugar in every recipe, but the resulting products are completely tasteless. My first attempt, the double chocolate cake, looked like a flattened elephant dropping after baking, and probably didn't taste much better--I threw it away. I tried a second recipe, replaced the full cup of sugar with Splenda, and still had to add more Splenda plus a bit of regular sugar to make it remotely edible (but still bad). I've had many ready-made sugar-free products that taste vastly better than anything in this book. If I could give this zero stars, I would. Ugh!"
4,A true celebration,We were familiar with just a few of Johnny McEnvoy's songs and were a little nervous about ordering such a completecollection. We were not disappointed. We really enjoy his style and are very happy with the album. We have playedit many times at this point and are not tiring of it. Great purchase!
3,Retread of World Almanac video from several years back.,"Most of the same experts and primary sources from earlier documentary that is no longer available. Some better production, but I think the important aspects of the story get lost in minutiae and side plots that did little except make the documentary longer than it needed to be. Also did not give enough pertinent details about the failures of both the NAACP and the Communists to really help the Scottsboro Boys when it mattered.I guess I wanted a version that wasn't so sanitized."
3,not necessary,"Although some of the pages were useful, a lot was repetitious or written by the co-author.The part that I am most looking forward to from the actual book - Chapter 11 Final Thoughts on Healing - is not part of the journal."
2,I was very bored with this book!!!,"When I first got this book I was looking for very direct info about how to tap into healing in all areas of life and I found that chapter after chapter there were sooooooo many examples that it just sucked the point out of what Mr. arterburn was trying to make! I have to admit there were some good points, but way too many examples for my taste. This doesn't mean that the book will not benefit anyone, but it was very exhausting trying to read through all the examples just to get a tiny bit of common knowledge! I would only recommend this book for someone who likes reading more of a long story then getting direct to the point answers."
4,Be Careful who you buy from. BUY HERE at Amazon,"I bought new copies from ""other sellers"" at $.75 each and the pages are assembled out of order!!! They should tell you why they are selling at 10% of Amazon price!!!BUYER BEWARE!!"
1,"Great title, minimal quality","Boy, talk about a misleading title....this book is neither sexy nor romantic, not really bad/awful, just not very good. It's near impossible to even finish it while looking for an interesting story."
2,ordinary at best,"Lots of range in topics, but very ordinary writing, the kind you read on any free site online. Nothing special, not worth the price."
4,From another erotic writer's point of view,"As I too am a writer of erotica, I believe my critique of Kate's book goes deeper than most, tougher, if you will. I was more than pleasantly surprised and entertained in the diversity and quality of her writing. Her book which offers a collection of her best short stories were unique from most read in any anthology. I commend her for going where most dare not go. Her stories being truly wicked yet, non-judgmental. She writes with conscious in a society that rarely seems to show one as she fluidly builds in safe sex measures that actually enhance and do not take away from the hot sex shown. From one who reads dozens of stories weekly, this is a book I would recommend to any who delight in adult pleasures."
4,Backlash....an alright ppv,"I'm not exactly sure why I even said this ppv was alright. I mean, Wrestlemania X-Seven was just too tough of an event to follow in my opinion. Don't get me wrong though, Backlash did provide some pretty cool entertainment with the Benoit/Angle Ultimate Submission Match and the Triple Title Tag Match between Austin/Triple H and Underaker/Kane. Bottom line, it's only worth buying if you are a hardcore wrestling fan, or if you missed the event and need it for the collection. Not the worst for 2001 so far, but certainly not the best. My advice, rent it if you are not sure. But, if you not sure and need one more reason to get it, get it for the Last Man Standing match between McMahon/Big Show. That was one hell of a leap from the 50ft Backlash superstructure."
2,BACKLASH,Keep away from this DVD at all costs! The PPV has been called the worst PPV ever. The main event was a tag title match with iC and championship belt on the line. HHH and Austin vrs Kane and Undertaker. The camera angles are so bad that you miss the finish of the match!
4,backlash 2001,"Not great but pretty good. The Best matches on the card were the hardcore championship, the last man standing and the ultimate submission match. the rest are ok. I gvie this PPV a 7 out of 10."
2,shane did superman again like ss 2000 by Joe Brown,shane vs big showduring da big show and shane match i only saw when test told shane 2 jump off da titraton which is 50 ft tall by da way shane shaked his head at lst then prayed 2 God 4 safety then jumped off the titraton 2 land on da big show i can't really rate this match due 2 that spot so this match gets no ratingrhyno vs raven hardcore matchnow this is what i call i hardcore match even though i haven't seen it n 4 years i remember how brutal and great of a match it was weapons like a shopping cart and trash cans along with other weapons was used n da match ***3/4 i wouldn't have mind a couple of more mins to this match if it would have recevied a couple of extra mins this would of been my hardcore moty
5,Greatest moment ever in WWF/WWE,The most hardcore moment to ever happen in the WWE/WWF is when Shane McMahon jumped off of the titantron. The WWE/WWF has never reached such a moment that resembles ECW as this moment.
3,Good!! All in one Match!!,"Overall it is a good PPV, but the best is the last match between taker n kane vs Austin n HHH.This match is long and very exciting.The rest is good, you can watch it once and then just watch the main event."
5,wwf backlash one of best of 2001,great PPV best match stone cold and triple h vs. undertaker and kane three titles on line dumb ending but in a werid way i like it because even thought stone cold is heel it was best for company all though they lose the titles to benoit and jericho it any way better than undertaker and kane only for a couple of months with title second best match last man standing unbelived ending great PPV
5,Amazing!!!!!!!!,"Stunnig, anazing pay per view. Benoit vs Angle was a hands down classic and suprised its not talked about more, it was off the chain! Rhyno and Raven have an off the hook hardcore match, and you wont be dissapointed if viewing it. The LMS match with a sick bump by Shane like he took at SS 00 ad at Unforgiven 03 on Kane! 9but missed on kane) Main event for 3 titles what more can you ask for out of a ppv?"
5,Amazing Backlash,"Three classics, Ultimate Submission, Last Man Standing, and Hardcore plus, three titles on the line"
4,The Two Man Power Trip reign Supreme,"Backlash was quite an event. My best friend was their I watched it on PPV though. The Dudleyz vs X Factor was OK after the match someone got wood it was cool. The Hardcore Title match was really good Rhyno gored a shopping cart and they used a kitchen sink.The Dutchess of Queensbury match was funny. The Dutchess was Regal's tag parnter his one in WCW.The Ultimate Submisson match was awesome it went into over time. The Last Man Standing Match had an awesome elbow from the top of the Backlash Hook.The Three Way European Match got Jeff and Edge involved it was cool. The Billon Dollar Princess got a big boot and Kane got destroyed.It was a PPV worth buying. If your in doubt buy it for the Last Man Standing,Ultimate Submisson, and FIRST EVER Dutchess of Queensbury Match.It was good"
4,Backlash,"The matches were good well at least most of them. If they would have promoted Backlah better I would have gave it a 5. The matches they promoted wre the best. The main event The Last Man Standing, The Ultimate Submission Match And Dutchesses of Queensberry match. I say buy it i know i will this is defently a collectors item."
3,"Backlash 2001, Extremly Average","Backlash, it was alright. The Kurt Angle/Chris Benoit match was good, as was the Hardcore title and the Last man standing. I could tell that the main event would be a miss because there was really no hype for it. Also, a tag match for the main event? Come on! The DVD extras are pretty cheap too, 4 match histories (they show them during the event) 2 Xtra matches (there is a reason they were on Heat, but there was a title change) and a few interviews. Not an awfull PPV, but I've seen much better."
5,Was Skeptical,"Have owned a pair of aviator Ray Ban's since I was a teenager. In fact, I have the original lenses crammed into a pair of walmart sunglass frames. Obviously, I was in need of new shades so I proceeded to try and find the best deal I could (they've gone up since the 80's (: As soon as the Ray Ban's arrived I went to several sites to read about knockoffs and fakes and to compare what I had bought with what other had been ripped off on. These Aviators are 100% authentic in looks, feel and minute details. Very pleased with my purchase and with this Amazon merchant, very nice!!"
5,Great sunglasses,"The sunglasses are great, the item is exacty as it was described it, I am very happy with it !"
3,The same were available for cheaper price,I found other website with cheaper price and could not return this product as there was 15% restocking fees involved
5,Ray Ban Aviators,"I bought these for my girlfriend for Xmas, they arrived extremely fast, next day I believe. In great shape, box and all. I'm very happy with the service would do business with them again."
1,Doubtful if it is genuine,The cover of the sunglasses seems fake. I already own the same glasses. Even the shine of the golden frame is not as good. No authentication certificate with hologram which normally accompanies the ray ban? I am doubtful! Better try & buy from local vendor.
1,"Poor quality, looks like factory seconds, bad packaging","Extremely disappointed with the product and the shipping. The box was mailed in a shipping envelope, not a box so the product box was badly crushed. This was a gift, so I wanted the presentation to be nice. I completed the Amazon form to report the poor packaging and asked for a response but got none.The glasses themselves are poor quality. The lenses are slightly different sizes and the nose pieces are crooked, so they fit oddly. It appears the glasses I received are factory seconds, not high quality Ray Bans. The person I gave them to asked me if they were knockoffs.In any case they are being returned today."
1,Poor Service,"Took two weeks to get here, and nose pad broke in one week, reach customer service for help, very unkind and unhelpful.Overall sucks."
1,I ordered a large and did not recieve large...,I ordered for my bf who owned a large aviator because it broke...when it came it looked a tad small but I didn't think much of it because I double checked the box and it said LARGE...but when I met my bf and compared with his old broken ray bans...my order was absolutely not LARGE...feels like you guys didn't have it in stock and just sent it to me thinking that I wouldn't notice...So mad that not only did the shipping take twice as long...but you guys sent me the wrong size saying that it is a large...
2,y is 55/14??,"is not LARGE METAL AVIATOR!!I want a size is 58/14,but this is 55/14,y seller dosen't have any notice abt size of it..disappoint"
4,the italian made glasses are great - long wait,"this order took a long time to arrive (4 1/2 weeks) due to it originating in the UK, and customs delays at both sides of the pond.James at Focus Network was great - doing all he could. If you want these glasses soon, this is not the way to go. If you want real italian madeRay Bans and are in no rush, this is a good supplier."
5,Love My New Aviator!!!,I wanted this sunglasses for a long time now... I love the classic look and elegance. I think this aviators will make anybody look good.
4,Great sunnies,"I broke my wayfarer and thought of buying a new one. But when i saw the aviator, i fell in love with it. It's durable, stylish and comfortable, 58mm's just my size and cheaper as well."
5,Awesomeeeeeee,Now that adds to my favourite sunglasses list :)This is the best ever classic sunglasses ever produced ! I wouldnt mind buying more colors of the same & I wudnt mind returning to this seller as well :)
5,The classics,"The original and classic style shades. Never go wrong with these on. Because of the chinesse fake saturation in every level, you always doubt about the authenticity of the products purchased online. Took mine to a optics shop and made the uv proof. They have 100% UV filter. So, could a fake pair have UV protection?"
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to receiving my sunglasses - I've wanted a pair of these for a while now, and this was a great deal. I ordered the black/nat.green polarized 55mm. I ordered them over two weeks ago, and unfortunately, I have yet to see them. It is 5 days past the latest delivery date, 9 past the earliest. I contacted the company last week, and was told that ""it seemed the package hadn't gone anywhere"" and to wait until Tuesday and they'll send another. I thought I had ordered them with plenty of time to spare before lifeguarding season began, but I have been blinded in the sun with cheap sunglasses for the past three days. This was my first order from Amazon.com, and sadly, I think it is my last."
1,Good but too big,The sunglass is goot but I had to return as it was too big for my face. I would suggest you try one out before ordering online
2,Not As Good As The Original Bausch & Lomb RB's!!,"I had a pair of Ray Ban Aviators for 20 years before they died from hard usage. Naturally, I immediately ordered another pair, at which time I noticed that they were no longer owned by Bausch and Lomb, nor domestically produced. Within a year, the metal frames had rust on them, something that never occurred with my previous sunglasses. Chalk it up to yet another sad example of selling the sizzle (the ""brand"") instead of the steak, now that the production and marketing rights are owned by people who have no pride beyond making a quick buck by substituting cr*p for what was formerly quality. You have to wonder how different these ""legitimate"" products are from the knock-offs sold from sidewalk tables, i.e., aren't they all from the same factory in China? The management philosophy here is apres moi la deluge."
3,Not polarized,"Ordered one from Amazon and received it today. It's a genuine RB3025, 62mm, Arista Gold/Crystal Green, looks nice and of high quality which is made in Italy, however NOT Polarized. Although marked in the web page description and also on the label of the box, it is not. It can be checked by some simple tests, e.g. by rotating the sunglasses to 90 degree in front of the light to see the effects of fading. Or it can be simply told from the logo on the lens. There is an extra P following the Ray-Ban logo on the lens for polarized version, but this one doesn't have. It would be a nice buy if you are not looking for a polarized one. Mine was shipped from Amazon directly, not sure about other sellers.Update: tried again with another seller (Sunglass Express), still not polarized. Have to return again."
2,The lens fell out after a week of wearing the sunglasses,The lens fell out after a week of wearing the sunglasses. My husband said he would fix them but for the price we decided to return them.
5,Love the classic,This would be my second pair in the last 5 years. I love the look and comfort from these Ray-Ban. Here's to another 5+ years!
2,they were ok,"it was not very good fit for me, and somehow it just didn't look good on me when i wore them."
5,The one and only,The most perfect relationship between price and product. The glasses are fantastic and also the case. Good sun protection and fit in the face perfectly.I bought another one for my best friend.
5,Very like it,"very nice, good looking, good price.the only problem is I don't know how to clean the leg when there occurs aerugo inside the end of the covered part"
1,Great for medium to small heads. Large heads avoid...,"If you have a large hat size, these sunglasses will not sit properly on your ears. I gave my sunglasses to a buddy with a medium hat size and they fit him fine. I don't know if these can be ordered with the sides a quarter inch longer...."
2,raybans,Raybans are always top quality but be aware these are more like prescriptions glasses than sunglasses. No hiding guilty eyes here!
4,It is so cool,"I bought RB3025 58 mm. It is a little bit bigger than my face. Actually, I really like it. It is a good price and delivered on time... I would like to buy it again for my brother. Thank you Amazon :)"
2,Don't buy Ray-Ban if you want customer service,"I bought a pair of Ray-Ban aviators with polarized lenses while on a recent trip. These are classic style and certainly the lenses are of excellent quality. However, there is a problem with all of the metal wire aviator style frames. They will easily lose their shape and that will cause the lenses to fall out. Trying to get some help on how to fix this from Ray-Ban's customer service department is impossible. They simply won't give out any information, unless you first send in your glasses via insured and certified postal delivery. The closest I came to getting any helpful information after re-phrasing my question was the costs of repair could range from $60 to $80 for the frames and $40 for the lenses. I won't buy any more Ray-Bans. They're already quite expensive."
5,good,"this is my first time buy glasses online,it is good and really cool,maybe i will buy another one someday.thank you,i really love it."
3,Not a great choice if its a Gift,"The product seems genuine enough, and is exactly as described, at a reasonable price. However, like another reviewer mentioned, the Ray Ban box appears crushed right out of the amazon packing box. The packing box is in mint condition, which rules out shipping damage.This is a great price if you are ordering these glasses for yourself, but you cant gift a squished box."
2,Currently Disappointed....,"Just received these Ray Bans for a Spring Break trip. They were shipped quickly, and were the correct item, but the right hinge was defective. It is so tight it feels like it might snap when you try and fold them up. The box also came fairly damaged even though it was within an Amazon box with bubble wrap. I am questioning if these glasses were really new when they were shipped or just heavily used display glasses.I'm hoping I can get these replaced or fixed before my trip. Usually don't have problems when I buy from Amazon but this is extremely disappointing."
3,Not Large!!,"The sunglasses are not large. They are one of the smaller versions Ray Ban makes. They arrived quickly and in perfect condition, just beware that they are NOT large."
1,Very very disappointed!,"I purchased this, thinking it will arrive in 2 days! The page is VERY misleading, it says fulfilled by amazon, I was told by amazon customer service that I purchased it ""directly"" from the seller! Amazon should ensure product descriptions/ ""fulfilled by amazon"" tags are accurate!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I have bought these sunglasses for my son. After 2 months of use - nothing rough - the nose support broke. I Tried to contact the company's representative in my country but they refered me to the shop where I had purchased the sunglasses but told me that I will probably have to replace the whole frame and that this is not covered by the waranty. I wrote to the company in Italy - Luxottica - and never got a reply that took care of my problem. Evetually, I went to a shop that repairs these type of things a got it fixed somehow for $30 - so to summarize - poor quality product and ever worse customer service. I would have given it a rating of ""ZERO"" if it would have been possible."
2,why no have soft case?,I am disappointed that I do not softcase.If it was not softcase authentic ray ban it.I bought it as a gift. But is this. It's really not okay.I am very disappointed.
1,Damaged,"I get glasses on time, but glasses is damaged. Not much but, you can see like small cracks on frame next to green glass.Also on two spot on frame, like is golden color is fall of. Problem is, beacose I finde all this on front sideoff glasses. I dount feel good about this and my rate is 1."
5,Great!,"Very easy/smooth transaction. Glasses came in perfect condition and were brand new! I saved a fortune and couldn't be happier! Although 3 days after my purchases the glasses dropped and the lens scratched, so I may be buying ANOTHER pair. :-("
4,They're so tiny,Great glasses.... But get the right size.... Mine felt like they would fit a ten year old... My fault... But they look like decently made glasses
3,Sunglasses,"I like them, but they are not as cute as I thought they would be. They look better in the picture."
4,Great deal and perfect glasses!,These were a great buy! Saw them in a department store for much more! great quality. Looks great and really protects from the sun!
2,Poor construction,"This sunglasses looks fake and fragile, it looks nice in your face but I have serious doubts about the quality"
4,"Good quality, but a little flaw.","Very good quality and genuine Ray-Ban 3025, I like it. However, I'm not sure whether manufacture process or packing cause the distortion of nose piece of glasses."
4,Great!,"Awesome shipping it came in the mail very fast! Although I though the frames were bigger because it said ""large"", I should've read more on the description. But overall still great sunglasses!"
5,My sunglasses,"I received the Ray-Ban sunglasses I bought and I was very happy with my purchase! The package arrived on time, faster than I expected! Thanks!!!!"
5,All Good,"Glasses are great! Just wish we could have received sooner, ordering on the 12th of December and receiving the last week in December seems a little long but it's when they said they would be there. Thanks no problems!"
3,screw loose,this product is ok but i wonder if its even real ray bans.. i have read someone else's review that said that one of the handles was loose and man were they right!! i think the reason its soo cheap is because amazon buys the defective models from ray ban. i wouldnt buy this product again. for 40 more bucks go buy it from the ray ban website. i think it would be more worth it than having a defective product.in conclusion dont buy this product if you wanna walk away satisfied.
4,Love them,"These glasses are great. Definitely very thin arms but shape and fit are great. You shouldn't really do anything dirty or rough in them. I got the gold ones and my only complaint is that theyre not super gold, they almost look silver in the dim light."
3,Authentic but it isn't Polarized,"I agreed with first review, I received same Ray Ban sunglasses. Normally, I haven't any problem shopping Amazon.com, except this one. I received Ray Ban RB3025 sunglasses with little damaged retail box during shipping. The sunglasses come with G-15Lens label on left lens, Ray-Ban on top of right lens. The sunglasses is authentic but it isn't Polarized. The Ray Ban Polarized sunglasses should have Ray-Ban P on Top of right lens, and with Polarized label on left lens."
4,Nice,"The description was misleading, as it says ""large metal"" so I thought it was the oversized frames, or at least large. When I opened the box I was dismayed to see the actual size. The product came fast (within a week) and at a good price. Make sure you do research online, or go to the store first and physically try them on, as you actually want to pay attention to the size in millimeters. 55mm is small, 58mm is medium, and 62mm is large. Most people get 58mm... Nevertheless, it is a great product, classic, and they look good. My bf loved them!"
4,Well done!,I read this collection of poems on adoption and was touched by each and every one. Never before have such simple words elicited such emotion. I laughed and I cried. This author offers insight into the world of adoption that few of us would ever have the opportunity to see otherwise. It was given to me as a gift but I would have gladly purchased it on my own. I highly recommend it.
5,Great!,A.C. Green is one of the classiest men in the NBA. Buy this book now and learn to live like a champion! You will enjoy his stories of his Laker days as well as his current ones. Great Book
3,armageddon 2000,"only two good matches last man standing match was good and the hell in the cell saved the ppv, i would have given the ppv only one star but the hell in the cell saved it. bye"
2,"BORING PPV , OK MAIN EVENT","Only hire this ppv, then if u like it buy it. This not a great ppv , the main event does sound very cooooooool, and some bits are.But honestly id rather get wwf king of the ring 98 or no way out 2000 or badd blood if u wanna see a hell in a cell match.The ppv was very boring as the whole ppv was just focused on the main event.Rikishi does fall off the cage but it was crap!He just fell back into a truck full of saw dust and the truck had a heep of shocks.Any way if u are a long time wwf fan and like getting the ppv's this is for you, but if u are a new wwf fan and just getting into i would go looking for something else such as royal rumble 2000 or wrestlemania 17 they are great!"
3,should of rented this one.,"i should of rented this tape instead of buying it, it wasnt all it was cracked up to be. It was still an okay show but it lacked in alot of matches. like jericho vs. kane that match was slow and had no big bumps at all. regal vs. holly started out good but started to drag. ivory vs. trish vs. molly was just stupid for a match. billy gunn vs. benoit was a snooze. the only good matches on the card were the hiac match and the tag team title match, and the hardys/lita vs. radicals was okay to.so take my advice only rent it dont buy it, i was expecting alot more than this."
4,A Good End For 2000!!!,"6 Man Intergender Tag Team Match ****The Hardy Boyz & Lita VS. The RadicalsA good high flying performance by all 6 wrestlers in this match.Chyna VS. Val Venis *A Stupid Match that should of happened on Raw or smackdown.WWF European Championship **Harcore Holly VS. William RegalA Ok MatchTriple Threat WWF Womens Championship Match ***Ivory VS. Trish Stratus VS. Molly HollyA great show By all 3 Women.WWF Four Courners Tag Team Championship Match ****E & C VS. Bull & The goodfather VS. K-Kwik & Road Dogg VS. The Dudley Boyz.A Excellent MatchWWF Intercontinental Championship Match *****Billy Gunn VS. Chris BenoitA great performance & My favorite match on the card.WWF Last Man Stannding Match *****Chris Jericho VS. KaneA 5 Star Match.WWF Championship, 6 Man Hell In A Cell Match *****Triple H VS. Undertaker VS. stone Cold Vs. The Rock VS. Rikishi VS. Kurt AngleA awsome match with a bad winner."
5,This is THE BEST PPV of 2000,"This is such a good PPV, I don't even know where I wanna start. Being the last PPV of 2000, the fans as well as Commissioner Mick Foley knew that the WWF should go out with a bang. We all remember the last Armageddon, where Stephanie McMahon turned on her own father. Well, this time in the main event there is more at stake than family or anything else. The matches are : 1-Elimination match: Radicalz vs. Hardyz & Lita 2-European Championship: William Regal vs. Hardcore Holly 3-Val Venis vs. Chyna 4-Last Man Standing match: Chris Jericho vs. Kane 5-Four Corners match for the WWF Tag Team Championship: Right To Censor vs. Edge&Christian vs. Dudleyz vs. Road Dogg&K-Kwick 6-Intercontinental Championship: Chris Benoit vs. ""The One"" Billy Gunn 7-Triple Threat Women's Championship: Ivory vs. Trish Stratus vs. Molly Holly 8-1st ever 6 man Hell in a Cell for the WWF Championsip: Kurt Angle vs. Undertaker vs. Rikishi vs. The Rock vs. Triple H vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin"
1,WWF Armageddon,This WWF PPV stunk! The Hell In A Cell Match was boring. The best match was the Hell In A Cell Match. If that was the best match then the other matches must have been realy terrible. Every match was realy boring. It is a waste of money. Do not get this WWF video.
3,Only For Hell in The Cell,"the only reason to see this ppv is for the incredible Hell in The Cell match. the rest was boring. kane v jericho last man standing was a wimpy match, and the rest were boring. hell in the cell was great, so maybe jus rent this for that."
5,Armageddon came through the WWF,"If you are a WWF fan and missed the PPV, you should buy this tape. From top to bottom this was a good card but the result was amazing. The 6 Man Hell in A Cell match is amazing. Those 6 man basically destory each other. Chris Jericho/Kane in a Last Man Standing Match is also good. There is also 6 Man Tag, 4 Corners Tag Title Match, Women's Triple Threat, European and Intercontential Title matches and Chyna faces RTC member Val Venis. Buy the Tape and see Armageddon."
4,not worth $40,"i rented this a few years ago and this was a great ppv but i cant see myself paying 40 bucks for it. Sure you got one of the greatest main events in history and 5 of the biggest super stars in WWf/e history (not rikishi though he did put on a very good match and a great show of guts allowing taker to throw him off of the cell). The mid card was patched up u have a few great matches and a few terrible ones. The lms match was great but had a lame ending and y were the rtc tag champs???? glad they lost. the first match was great along w/ gunn/benoit and the tag title match was decent. Regal/holly, womens title, val/chyna all absolutly suck. Though with this ppv the good out shines the bad and i hope to see a Smackdown vs Raw 6 man Hiac in the future (maby HBK v HHH v Cena v Batista v RKO v Angle?)in conclusion this ppv is worth about 10-12 $$ if it is on that low it will definitly be a high seller.PEACE"
3,hell in a cell!,"The World Wrestling Federation put on some AWESOME shows in 2000, however, armageddon was not one of them. the Hell In A Cell while good, was a major let down compared to what foley and taker did. Plus, if you like it when the good guys go over, i would not suggest picking this tape up as y2j is the only face to win their match. the only good thing about this tape is the fact that chris benoit destroys and takes the i-c title from billy gunn"
5,Quintissentially Irish,"Speaking to the heart of things Irish, the works of Frank McCourt will touch your soul. I have actually read both works twice, and laughed and cried again with each read.. From the eyes of young Frankie McCourt we see every human emotion, from love to fear to loathing , to the light in a child's eyes when he discovers reading and the power of words and an education. One can only wonder how anyone survived such poverty and emotional scars as the McCourts surely must have felt being raised by their parents. The language of these wonderful works is unmistakenly Irish, and is a classic example of what the Irish do best!!!"
5,The toughest job you'll ever love (eventually)...,"This will be the most boring, most useful book you'll ever come across. Playing this (and its companion Advanced book for positions 8-12) each all the way through once a week for about half a year was seriously the best thing I ever did for guitar.You'll hate doing it, but you'll never complain about not knowing how to read music in any key (F# anyone?) and you'll automatically know the fretboard inside and out, up and down."
1,not what i thought,"When i purchased this book i thought it would be more comphrensive like teach you how to read music, and the differnt fingerings you should use in the various poistions 1-7 etc. But what i found out its just a workbook for people who already know how to read music its just a book of drills. The text was very unprofessional its hand written. So if you to are looking for a manual in how to read music this isn't it look else wear."
5,Forgotten Topics when Teaching English Conversation,"This book is great for tutoring or teaching English to intermediate or advanced learners of English. It covers topics that you forget, like how to agree or disagree with an opinion someone has suggested.It is funny as a native speaker to read these topics and realize I use these words and phrases everyday, but I would never before think to teach them to students learning to speak English. The book also gives ideas, activities, and worksheets for teaching and learning the topics.It's a little known book, but an awesome resource for ESL/EFL teachers. Especially when they want you to teach ""conversation."" I know it feels daunting, but this book will help tremendously! Also, this book is great for corners, when you sit around and just speak English: you can focus on certain topics.Great resource!"
4,debs read today,"Debs, altho somewhat dated, is amazingly prescient in his critique of predatory capitalism and how it corrupts democracy as well as all its citizens. What a great and mostly forgotten American hero. Like most American labor leaders our collective American amnesia and hell-bent drive for conservatism has relegated these martyrs to the dust bin of history. This book was a salient reminder of how much we owe people like Debs and how correct they were in their foretellings of unchecked capitalism. This was a very worthwhile read."
2,"Note to editor: socialism failed, historial value limited","Debs played a role in American history, however, the study of his ideas is primarily of antiquarian interest. The editors might note that socialism has failed everywhere on the planet."
3,Desing Runner Ink,well eventually it was delivered and to be honest I really do not like the fact that you have to pay an extortionate amount for a simple ink cartridge which works out more than the design runner on its owm from some places
4,Doing psychology critically,"Also brought this book for uni studies, so didn't read the whole book....who ever has that much time when trying to fit everything in."
3,Not for Vista,I have used this DVD at work & was pleased to find an inexpensive copy for home...problem is it wouldn't download because it's for XP and not the Vista I use at home. I was able to return it for a full refund. If you have Vista you can't use this DVD!
4,Kids have a blast learning to type with SpongeBob,My kids (ages 7 and 10) have enjoyed this program very much. It seems to be improving their typing and is not monotonous with all the various games and challenges included. The only minor annoyance is hearing SpongeBob repeat some of his encouragement phrases over and over but the kids do not seem bothered by it.
2,uk2us,"Not the best Earth and Fire CD available. (Try self named Earth and Fire) Only brought this CD because it had a couple of tracks from Reality Fills Fantasy album, which I still can not seem to find anywhere. The tracks on this album didn't seem to sound like I remembered from that great album. Must admit though it has been many years since I have heard it. Some of the other tracks are OK, but the better ones on this CD can be found on Earth and Fire CD (some on the bonus tracks)All I can say though is that if you have never heard of Earth and Fire (Absolutely nothing like Earth Wind and Fire) then I would suggest you get one of their albums. Not a real heavy rock band, but good music with a great female lead vocalist. Of course if you can ever find Reality Fills Fantasy Album then buy it. You'll be an Earth and Fire Fan Forever."
4,This is the best NoMeansNo in Years!!,"As a long time fan of NoMeansNo, I can say that this is the album I've been waiting for since 0+2=1. Tom Hollistien, the new guitarist has finally settled in, and developed a style with the Brothers Wright. This album has a little bit of everthing, from Epic Pounding songs like ""The Rape"" to Hanson Brother style songs like ""Going Nowhere"". For fans and newcommers, this is a great CD. It is safe to say that NoMeansNo remains one of the most creative of all Hardcore bands, and probably will remain so for years to come. Old age has done nothing to dull their talents."
1,"He can't stop talking, alright...","This album contains one of the most adequate song titles in music history. ""I can't stop talking"", the ""singer"" whines (he can't stop whining either, you see) and that's about all he ever does. Sure, once in a blue moon he actually sings the ""chorus"" but most songs by this band is built in the same way: a monotonous bass line to which the ""singer"" talks and talks and talks. He tries to add drama, but he just can't seem to get it right; he just raises his voice at random, adding no drama whatsoever. But their concept is brilliant. This way, they don't need to actually write songs and they still make a lot of records that people buy for no apparent reason. Stay away from this crap!"
4,a concise introduction,"Bhikkhu Bodhi clearly lays out each of the eight parts of the Buddha's prescription for a happy life. He explains the traditional divisions of the eightfold path, and makes clear what the ""right,"" or correct, position for each step is. Thankfully it is not a philosophical dissertation but is instead a straightforward introduction to the Buddhist Way which is short enough for me to reread again & again."
3,The nuts and bolts of the path,"If you just want to wake up, this book will stir you. A person could devote a lifetime to just practicing from this book. Or you could just practice without books all together."
1,Of how to create a sect and think it's really true!!!,"I'm amazed to see that Amazon.com is selling books of this author! In my country, Chile, it is well known how this man has cheated many many people, stealing their money to buy a land, the supposed ""Valle Sagrado"", as in the ""Sacred Valley of the Incas"". His ideas, exposed in this book, are nothing more and nothing less that creating the ""biggest spiritual school of Latinamerica"", with such a pretense of being of course the leader of it. ..."
5,unas historias reveladoras,"mientras mas leia este libro de suryavan, sentia que me metia en la historia y que estaba aprendiendo tantas cosas mientras me estaba divirtiendo bastante leyendo historias entretenidas. pero al mismo tiempo son tan reales y con tanto poder que nos ayudan a aprender de la vida y a ser mejores personas, y a crecer personalmente. hay una historia en especial que mientras leia paso el tiempo y me sumergi en la historia y simplemente la estaba viviendo yo no sabia nada del tiempo. fue una historia que activo muchas cosas dentro de mi."
5,Fantástico!!!,"Genial!!! No existen libros tan completos y fantásticos como los de este Autor.De manera especial y magica nos lleva en este libro a descubrir algo que existe más allá transportándonos en el tiempo y espacio al tiempo que nos entrega enseñanzas únicas en su estilo. Realmente quien no haya leido este libro se pierde bastante, quien opine diferente es porque no lo ha leido realmente oentendido su mensaje.Brilliant!!! So complete and fantastic books do not exist as those of this Author.On a special and magical way this book takes us to discover something that exist further and beyond, transporting us throw time and space giving us at the same time unique lessons. Those who have not read this book yet are missing to much, and if someone thinks differently is because it hasn't been read or did not understood its message."
2,Very Poor,I am a beginner to Cisco IOS and their products but have an extensive background in networking. I guess I have been spoiled by well written training guides from Microsoft press. This book is extremely hard to use as a training guide. There seems to be no method or structure as peices and topics of information jump at you. I find myself wasting too much time having to read paragraphs over again because they are unclear. Wish I has purchased a different book!
1,More of the same from Cisco,I'm sorry but this book is not a comprehensive review for the CCNA exam. It offers some material that is not included in other cisco books but that's all. This seems to be the pattern for all cisco books. Info is spread out among many sources and not summarized in any one place. Combine that with poor indexes and incomplete glossaries and you get the picture. I suspect to get a complete high-points review for the CCNA exam you will have to seek a non-cisco publications to do it.
2,Poorly written.,"Typo's and spelling errors abound. Examples are poorly outlined and often terms used are left undefined. The book even lacks a glossary to look them up. An instructional / Study aides should be written in a clear easy to follow fashion. This is not. ""Mastering Cisco Routers"" by Brenton Hamilton Kessler is Far better."
2,Errors and Inconsistancies,"You would think that going to the source for exam preparation materials would be the best possible scenario. While this book has a wealth of information, there are numerous errors and inconsistancies which make this a very difficult tool to use. The included CD which features pactice tests and study guides has numerous flaws, typos, and downright bugs.The topics covered are accurate for exam preparation, but the Q&A portions feature questions relating to the section with subject matter that wasn't covered.If you want to be frustrated with a poor structure - this is definitely the manual for you. This would make a good reference source, but it's a poor preparation study guide - you can do much, much better."
2,Test Engine [Stinks],"I bought the book for reference during the coming years and to get the practice test engine to pass my CCNA. The book is OK but the practice test are a joke. There was no grammer check. A couple of questions made absolutly no sence. Questions are marked wrong during grading, but when you review then, the yellow line say they were right. Some questions would not let me answer them, others had circles where there should have been boxes and vis versa. When I emailed Cisco there answer was to down load the test engine for 507...big help Cisco. If I wanted the 507 test I would have bought a 507 book. Bottom line is that you can't trust Cisco to proof read and test thier own product. Get help from somebody else that has better quality control."
2,"Too many errors, too hard to read...","Man, is this stuff dry! I did buy Todd Lammle's book (who hasn't?) and this is so hard to read after reading that book.Although this has a lot of technical information, it is hard to gleen it from the text without falling a sleep.Plus, too many errors on the practice exams to make them worth while."
2,"Good Reference Guide ,but Bad Study Guide","This book makes the CCNA test seem harder than it is.While it has all the information in it you need, it is not layed out very well to present it. Suggestions for future additions would be to use a bigger font for the text.The Sybex study guide for the CCNA test is the best. Easy to ready and if you have expereince with routers and switches you will not have a problem passing the test with this guide"
2,I'd expected more from this book. Too Much Pages!!,"As i said in the title, I purchased this book with the hope of find, at least, the same good material of the CCDA Certification Guide (I'm CCDA, of course because of this book among others), but, sadly, what i'd find with this book, was a very big amount of pages that makes the most confusing explanation that was possible, with a very big amount of open questions that the real answer to those was the Odom's thinking finally, instead of making questions more precise, like the questions of the exam. I apologize to purchase this book."
1,This book needs serious editorial attention!,"This has to be the worst book released since the first edition of the McGraw Hill CCIE Study Guide. It's jam packed with technical errors, questions without proper answers, and explainations without context. I made the terrible mistake of waiting to offer a CCNA course until this book became available so my students would have the benefit of the latest material. Bad idea folks. Don't even bother with the practice exam, even if you pass... the test won't know it! This book needs to be recalled and a corrected version made available ASAP. I can only assume they were in a rush. I feel sorry for the author, who otherwise has an extremely good track record.I'm sure the next release will be much better and I seriously recommend waiting for it.- Dan Stachowiakdan@its-inc.biz"
1,Can we say - RUSHED TO PRESS!,"When I started studing for the Cisco CCNA exam. I started with the older 640-507 book, and then purchased this book to make sure I had the latest info. I have to give kudos to the author who makes everything easy to understand - but you can easily tell this book was rushed. The testing software is useless. And the book has MANY inconsistancies. I took and passed the CCNA test today. I was totaly unable to use this book for my last minute studying and resorted to the old 640-507 book.In short this author is awesome so DEFINITELY get this book but! WAIT FOR THE FIXED REVISION!"
1,IS IT TOO LATE TO RETURN THIS BOOK???,That's it! I have tried several times to keep focused and read this book but it's a very poor training guide. If I didn't have a background in networking it would be impossible to learn anything new. I have read several certification guides with no complaints. I am very disappointed and ready to order a different book. Time to auction this baby off!
3,Edited?????,"The editors of this book did a horrible job. The book has many errors. A lot of questions and answers in this book but the answers don't necessarily match the question. The CDROM is very frustrating since it is not possible to get several of the questions correct since the answer format doesn't allow it. I also had trouble with the flashforms which represent the practical experience questions. After I would finish configuring the routers and clicked on ""done"" I would go to the next question but then the test engine would get stuck on that question and couldn't go forward. I'm completing the Network Academy and I wanted this book to get experience on the hands on questions. It's just too bad that the editors didn't catch all the errors in the book and CD."
1,Save your money for Yared!,"If you want to hear the inklings of Horner's ""Braveheart"" then buy this soundtrack. It only tells the story of war and not of the many love stories that coincide. This is the WORST soundtrack I've every purchased. I'll save everyone the misery of not posting it on EBay and instead just throwing it in the trash!Let's hope Warner Bros will release Gabriel Yared's rejected score which seems to be getting great reviews!"
1,Horner's score actually made me like this movie less...,"Not only is his score recycled, (watch Enemy at the Gates... you'll hear it) it's painfully out of place in this film. The entrance to the city of Troy is especially dreadful. I remember watching Troy, seeing the wonderful enterance of Hector, Paris and Helen and thinking, ""Did someone just step in an orchestra?"" Scales, followed by overpowering misplaced notes, repeditive, a disaster. It makes me want to pay John Williams to try and at least make a score that fits the film, because I believe this movie drags as much as it does because of its horrid score... which is too bad, because it could've been a great one. Too bad I had to give it one star just to say this."
2,Disappointed!,"The disc itself is in mint condition - I have no complaints; however, the music is not as expected, except for the last song.It simply does not flow through my heart, it totally depicts the warlike atmosphere and that is what I should have expected. There are too many drum rolls which is not my idea of music for the soul.Overall, the disc is not worth the money I paid to get it."
3,sounds like Enemy at the Gates,"The music of this movie for me sounds like the score of Enemy at the Gates , specially the theme The river crossing to Stalingrad of that movie."
2,pretty boring,"Overall, the music didn't detract from the move too much but it didn't enhance it any way either. Many of the themes were unoriginal and not very exciting worthy of this big budget movie. I recognized themes lifted from classical works such as Shostakovich's 5th symphony-IV and Vaughan William's Fantasia on a Theme by Talis."
1,Stick to the story,"It probably would have given the soundtrack even a little merit had the writer actually stuck to the Iliad the way Homer wrote it. For goodness sake, he got the deaths of 4 major characters all wrong. Plus the fact that they just completely left out the actual reason for the war starting in the first place. The only thing that was really true to the book was Achilles' love. If they had actually written a script that would have followed the story, James Horner's job probably would have been a heck of a lot easier and there might have been a much better soundtrack."
1,Pass,"Why buy this when you can watch:Mask of ZorroEnemy at the Gates,etc etc etc.Way to go Horner. I know you had only a few weeks to compose this but seriously, a soundtrack should serve to enhance the film, while Troy's merely overpowers it (with cliched crescendos and the same damn musical interludes we've heard a dozen times in other Horner soundtracks).Stop buying soundtracks people, even the good ones don't sound good as stand-alone listening. There not even supposed to stand alone in the first place."
3,decent,"This is a decent soundtrack. I was very surprised though that the main theme of the soundtrack of the film is in fact an excellent example of pure plagiary. It is the exact same theme as the maine theme of Sergei Rachmaninov's first symphony (just check it here on amazon). And the composer of the soundtrack in fact steals several of Rachmaninov's inventive uses of it pure and simple. More people steal from him, of course (amongst others Celine Dion in 'all by myself' - preparatory theme is a pure copy of one of the main progressions in Rachmaninov's second piano concerto). It will not come as a surprise that Rachmaninov makes an incomparably superior composition out of it definitely worth checking out in a decent rendition...that being said, the soundtrack certainly isn't bad, although somewhat repetitive..."
3,What about doing something original?,"James Horner is a fine composer and has composed some of the best movie scores. I have generally like most of his work. But lately I've noticed it seems he is borrowing heavily from his previous works when completing a new score. Nothing wrong with that I guess, but in listening to this work you can hear echoes of a Perfect Storm, another good score. Have we come to the point now that everything that's done is done? Nothing is original anymore? I hope with Mr. Horner as well as others in genre (because he is not the only one guilty of this) will dig deep for some truly moving scores worthy of the talent they all have."
1,Gladiator Lite,"Given that the film's poster uses the same colors as 'Gladiator,' I expected there to be some echoes of Hans Zimmer's influence--but not a total rip-off! And a shoddy one at that--the aforementioned Wailing Woman is a painful substitute for Lisa Gerrard, who made 'Gladiator' shine."
1,"TERRIBLE, A disappointment.","The only reason I am giving this CD one star is for the last track by Josh Groban.If you want to know what this soundtrack is like, think of elevator music. This soundtrack is almost entirely 75+minutes of such music.It's a shame Hollywood likes reused themes by James Horner. I could have sworn I heard bits of his other works.Gabriel Yared's music was five star material. It should have been used. Listen to it here. www.gabrielyared.com"
2,The rush job shows...,"Why, oh why, did they pull Gabriel Yared from the score only two months before the movie was due to be released? I know it was said to have had poor audience reactions in test screenings, but putting Horner on the project, who composed a brand new score in only 13 days, does not appear to have been the better choice. The Troy soundtrack is definitely disjointed, loud and ""messy"". Too many tracks have far too much brass, an awkward tempo and no sense of cohesivness. The only track I truly liked was Josh Groban's ""Remember Me"". I have gone to Yared's website and heard clips from his rejected score, and all I can say again is ""WHY??"" I find his work on this project to be far superior."
3,Where are the Melodies?,"Checklist for last-minute epic score: synths, soundstage pick-up orchestra with at least 2 drummers, sight-reading wordless chorus, female singer(s) moaning in exstacy on demand, circle of fifths and other chording references to hand. Modulate the chords, vary the elements. One would expect no hummable melodies and expectations are met. Nonetheless a decent sounding disk that met all producers' requirements and, despite anything preceding, can be listened to as accessible quasi-classical music with depth of (fake) field. Not bad, just not great; most of the little people named endlessly in flick title probably had greater prep. notice than Mr. Horner--who probably CANNOT write a BAD piece unless the producers ask for one for effect."
1,The same as ever. YARED SCORE IS BETTER,a bad score. The same as ever. Horner copies himself again. Yared score is BETTER. Wolfgang Petersen is WRONG. I want the Gabriel Yared score released now!
3,Functional at best.,"Horner's score is merely functional. While the more romantic elements of the score are indeed nice, as it is what Horner is known for, the action/battle cues are boring, uniteresting, and simply uninspired. However, it is a tremendous effort since Horner had only 13 days to score the film after the unceremonious rejection of Gabriel Yared's labor of love."
2,COPY-CAT,"I've been a huge fan of movie soundtracks for years. This could be the rip-off the millenium. You practically might as well the sountrack from ""The Mask of Zorro"" and slip in the cover for Troy. I am extremely disappointed with Troy's music. I don't care if it was made in 13 days or 13 years...when you make a soundtrack for a movie, it's for A MOVIE, not a National Geographic special!! James Horner to his credit, has done great work in the past. But this was a low for him. Right now, I'd have to say that Hans Zimmer's work is awesome. Horner should've taken the time to really write the poetic music deserving of such an epic movie. (...)."
3,Sounds like Gladiator.,"I honestly expected to find out that this music was done by the same person who did Gladiator's score. I thought Dead Can Dance would have been named because this music sounds exactly the same.I actually liked the music in the movie, not having heard of course Gabriel Y's version to compare it with.I didn't think it was so bad...I actually kinda liked it."
2,Beware of CD Bearing Bad Music,"The CD is a good combination of Braveheart, Titanic, and Enemy at the Gates all in one- big brassy fanfares, spiraling string crescendos, oh- don't forget the overbearing hammering of the percussion. James Horner seems to favor the chime once again which reminds of the closing watertight chambers sequence in Titanic. Vocal sythesizers create the more ominous overtone alongside the haunting vocal work of Tanja Tzarovska. The atmosphere she creates, particularly in the opening ""3200 Years Ago"" echoes strongly from Lisa Guerrard in Gladiator.Unfortunately the honor of Troy is betrayed not only by Greeks but also by a cheesy French Horn/Trumpet theme, more hot air than anything else. Other than that the CD is a never-ending battle between percussion and brass, lacking theme and direction. Don't buy this album expecting it to sound like the trailer music. Horner did not write the original trailer music for the film."
4,Epic score,"Pretty much how I thought this score was going to be. Not to memorable allthough it has that epic sound these kind off movies need. As a Horner fan I can't dislike it, but I can say that it is not his best. Would have given it a 3 if it was not for Josh Gorbans awesome song at the end. Powerful and gripping."
1,troy,"As a music major, i'm completely unimpressed with this score. Never have i heard the likes of such plagiarism as in this one. I counted 7 different phrases i recognized throughout the movie. The ones that annoyed me the most was the horn solo from Shostakovich's 5th symphony and those taken from Mussorgsky's Pictures. I refuse to support Horner from here on out; if i want to listen to his music, i'll simply put in a CD i already own."
1,One of the all-time worst ever,this has to be one of the worst soundtracks ever. horner supposedly spent very little time putting it together after they pulled Yared's rendition. you can listen to what could have been at gab yared's website
2,Very Similar to Vaughan Williams,"All I have to say about this soundtrack is very similar sound to Vaughan Williams String composition Fantasia on a Theme By Thomas Tallis. Of course it isn't exactly the same, but the theme is very similar."
4,Josh Groban fan,I buoght the Troy sound trackthis soundtrak is really good but on the down side they could have spented more time on making the Cd. I agree with one of the viwes that they could gave Josh Groban a few more mintues on the song Remeber me to me they picked the right preson to do that song Josh you did a wonderful job on that song you just keep on getting better and better when you do more songs and you should check out Josh Groban's video for this song Remeber me it is a great video you can check it out at www.Lunch.com or www.VH1.com
2,"Only for ""Remember""!","I bought this album only for Josh Groban's track! That song itself deserves 5 stars but the rest of the soundtrack is a total waste. I've tried to give it several listens but the more I hear it, the more annoying it gets. It's such a rip-off from the Gladiator soundtrack of which I only liked a few tracks. If you're able to find ""Remember"" on any other album, get that instead & save yourself the agony!"
3,"OK, but not Horner's best","This definitely has the feel of a rushed last-minute project, with motifs cribbed from earlier works, and often it's too loud. I feel like I can listen to a track and say ""that's from [movie x]."" However, having said that, I do like the soundtrack. I just don't love it."
3,It was suprisingly better than I thought it would....,"It was suprisingly better than I thought it would be. I was kind of worried that James would have made almost a replica of The Mask of Zorro, just with an ethnic clang and loud percussion but he proved himself worthy for the score. He composed a powerful, moving theme that took me by storm. Tracks like 'Troy'(majestic) and 'The Trojans Attack' contain the main theme.One other song was 'Remember Me' by Josh Groban. Awesome!There were times where I could've swore I was listening to Titanic or Braveheart( There was quite few moments for Braveheart) But, it is great to listen to. So...it IS worth your money and worth claiming a spot in your music collection....just don't expect the best."
3,Not his best but not bad for two weeks work...,"Yah, okay - lots of people like to take shots at Horner. Based on the reviews I've read here, this Soundtrack is no exception. It is true that it is not his best work but give the guy some credit. He had only two -three weeks to write AND record the score and I think the result is pretty impressive. He does borrow some from other scores he has done (in this case it is more forgiveable than others) but the result is a solid effort. It makes one wonder what he could have done given more time. The song Remember with Josh Groban is awesome, one of the best songs from the end crdits of a film I've heard in long time (maybe since..Titanic?) Horner is very talented and can do more with two weeks than many others could do with two months. If you are a fan of his work you will probably agree."
3,Well...,"I agree that this was not the best soundtrack to have accompanied such an epic movie, but I have to say that it was enough. Yes, Horner's themes sounded as though he had directly stolen them from Zimmer, but they were effective in the emotions they were able to convey. Purchasing the CD is probably a better idea if you can disassociate the score from the movie. The music itself is excellent if you aren't constantly reminded of the film, otherwise it leaves a lot wanting."
3,This one will not win any Oscars,"True, I don't own the soundtrack but what I heard during the movie sure as heck did not inspire me to go out and buy it either.Its not that the music is unbearable its just that it sounds like the movie is---too much melodrama is invibed into the musicWith the possible exception of ""The Sacking of Troy""Overall-skip this one"
2,A mediocre score for a mediocre film,"Maybe it was because James Horner had to put this together so quickly, but this is a terrible and overblown score. Stealing an entire 8-note theme from Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 isn't fooling anyone, and elements of Star Trek II (an earlier Horner work) and Stargate are easily distinguishable. I haven't heard any of Gabriel Yared's work for this movie, but I'm tempted to say I'd prefer it to this pulseless ""epic"" score anyway. Better by far than anything on this soundtrack, sadly, is the music produced specially for the teaser trailer by Musikvergnuegen. After hearing that I was excited at the musical direction this movie was taking. But no luck, I suppose."
2,shosty,"For all you classical music listeners, doesn't the theme played throughout the movie sound like Shostakovitch 5's horn solo?"
1,Josh Groban is the only reason to buy this album,"For those who are putting down ""Remember Me"" sung by Josh Groban, with background vocals by Tanja Tzarovska, this is the best part of the album. As most others have said, the rest if just mediocre. To be honest with you, the only reason I bought this CD was to hear Josh Groban."
3,This is getting a bit rediculous.,"It is time to release Yared's version of Troy.See, it's selling close to $100 every time it shows up on ebay, reviewers on Amazon are clamoring for it, and it's almost impossible to get. Why is WB being so stubborn? There's obviously a market for this thing.Not to take away from Horner here, as making a soundtrack (eventhough somewhat recycled) in under a month is impressive, but Yared's work is clearly superior in the minds of many.Come on WB, you did harm by stripping the score out of the movie, but the greater harm is not releasing this thing at all. Suck up the pride and make it available to us."
1,"Jarring, irritating, and just plain inappropriate","As stand-alone music, it's alright; in the movie Troy, it was almost obscenely bad. For me, music can make or break a movie, and Horner's inexplicably out-of-place soundtrack definitely hurt my enjoyment of Troy. Yes, it's reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's Gladiator score, but when Zimmer did it, it enhanced and uplifted the film. Horner's slapstick imitation was too loud, too drawn-out, and too grating; instead of making the moment more emotional and evocative, the ""music"" overwhelmed the scene and destroyed it. Walking out of the theater, my first thought was not about the movie but about how awful the music was. With Troy's budget, I really can't believe they settled on this garbage for the soundtrack."
1,save your ears the agony,"I don't think Helen, Achilles or the Greeks caused the fall of Troy- it's the SOUNDTRACK!!! There is no depth, no nuance or feeling in this music. The soundtrack to Troy is a cut and paste job from a generic Hollywood playbook on ""How to do BIG movie soundtracks 101."" It was a rare moment for me when the soundtrack to a movie made me dislike a film I otherwise would have liked."
1,One of the worst scores of all time...,"It all started when Gabriel Yared's original score was rejected in the last minute and James Horner was called to the rescue,Horner,aka Mr.Recycle,is known for recycling all his scores in the last 20 years from his early great projects such as Star Trek 2,Aliens and Willow.Now,If Horner had time to do his usual recycle work for ""Troy"" it might have turned out to be okay in Horner scales(which still means crap)but since he had only a week and a half or something like that to score ""Troy"" he gives us the worst of the worst,When I saw ""Troy"" I couldn't believe how bad the music was and even worse how badly it was timed with the movie itself,Most of the score is a gladiator wannabe with some memorable cues from ""Willow"" which Horner recycled about 50 times for recent scores.It is amazing that the producers of this movie green-lighted this score since it is a joke.Stay away..."
5,WOW...James Horner does it again....and Josh was TERRIFIC!!,"James Horner does it again for me. I heard his music for the first time when I heard the Titanic soundtrack. His most recent endeavor was the most beautiful thing I have EVER heard. And I am one of those aforementioned Grobanites. Josh is just the most fantastic singer that ever graced us with his presence. He displayed such tremendous power and emotion. I swear, you can't get better than that. Josh is just getting better and better every time I hear him. He's just the most amazing guy ever. ""Remember Me"" was TERRIFIC. A beautiful ending to a beautiful soundtrack. Great job, James Horner, Tanja Tsarovska (you're a beautiful singer), and Josh Groban!!!!"
5,A gift from a new author!,Absolutely wonderful book. What fiction is all about. Strout explores the intimacies of this mother and daughter team. Amy and Isabelle love each other enough to hate each other. The author perfectly balances every emotion.
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"I could not put this book down. In fact, I read it for four hours straight traveling from San Franscisco to Chicago and at one point was warned I would hurt my eyes if I continued (unknown to me, they had shut the lights out on the plane). Anyway, I don't have much time for reading, but I found time for this book. Highly Highly recommended. I have not been able to find a book this great since and hope the author has a new book coming out very soon."
3,Did not meet expectation,"A good novel but drawn out. The characters became boring midway through the story. I was eager to read this first novel by Ms. Strout but was a little disappointed at the outcome. A good read for someone who doesn't mind a story going off in various, unnecessary directions. Should have had more develop between Amy and her teacher, clearly the point of interest in this story. But instead we must muddle through secondary character's lives and troubles. Found myself not too excited about finishing this one."
2,Boring...,"My book group just read this book. Most of the members really enjoyed it, but I didn't. I agree with the reviewer who said the story line just never took off. I guess the focus of the book was meant to be the relationship between the mother and daughter, but I even found that a bit dull. I found the author very descriptive, but could have done a better job with character development."
2,Promising but disappointing.,"After seeing this book recommended by the Today Show, I have to say I was more than slightly disappointed. For a first novel it had a lot of promise, but I could tell the author was more of a short story writer. I had hoped for a more powerful conclusion. What happened to the teacher? He seemed to be the murderer of the young girl. I wanted to see the loose ends tied up. It let me down."
2,On & Off,This book was on & off. At some parts you just wanted the book to end and at others you could hardly put it down. It was an interesting story with lost of twists and turns but needless to say was definately a first book for the author.
2,This was a best seller??,"This book wore me out. I kept waiting for it to get somewhere with a plot of substance. I found myself skimming a lot of the text to get through the minutia of unrelated stuff. I got within a couple of chapters of the end, and just threw it aside. I didn't care how it ended because I was just tired of the story."
2,a fair first effort,"I agree with the customer comments by ustico@snte.net. Specifically, I got tired of reading about the gastroenterology of the characters. There must be more to these characters than their guts. Reading this book made me appreciate Jane Hamilton's books even more--they're flawless and the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Jane Hamilton is better at writing about disturbing events. On the plus side, some of the observations about mothers and daughters were insightful and worth reading. I was surprised to read the glowing book reviews in the NY Times, New Yorker, etc. It was the New Yorker review that promted me to read the book. I was heartened by some of the customer comments which brought out some of the things that bothered me or didn't occur to me. Thank you."
1,Ugh!,I felt absolutely frustrated by this book. The style of writing drove me crazy! Strout's overuse of brackets was unbearably distracting. I kept hoping something interesting would happen in the story but it never did. Most of the characters were typical and the ending was way too contrived. I give the author credit for capturing Amy's teenage personality but not much else. Very disappointing read.
3,Mothers and Daughters,"Elizabeth Strout was successfully able to illustrate the relationship struggles between many mothers and daughters. The story is set in a seemily small and quiet town during an incredibly hot summer. Isabelle works in the town mill and desperately wants to fit in while Amy attends high school and wishes the same. Both remain distant from themselves and each other.Tensions build when Isabelle discovers a secret about Amy. This secret unlocked many things that Isabelle burried away about herself. Feeling betrayed and exposed, Isabelle must confront her daughter and eventually herself. In the confronting, each learns more about herself.Amy and Isabelle is a novel about coming full circle. The reader is taken along the road of struggle, bravery, and being true to one's self.Try this book for a bookclub as I am sure that it will evoke many feelings and a great discussion. What is more important and discussion worthy than the mother-daughter relationship?"
4,Strong debut,"""Amy and Isabelle"" ultimately is a fine novel, a great debut (I believe) for Elizabeth Strout. I will admit that while I never found the book boring, I also had a hard time reading it for any length of time until the end. I don't know why that was. I also found that she used too much foreshadowing. But these are minor complaints of an overall fine novel. The lead characters are beautifullly crafted, and I was impressed at how well Strout tied up the story; the last 50 pages provided a fitting end to this book. I look forward to more from Strout."
4,The Ties That Bind,"This was a terrific mother/daughter story. I could picture both characters: Tight-lipped Isabelle and Amy hiding behind her voluminous hair. I felt it was quite believable - Isabelle hiding a secret that she doesn't realize isn't nearly as shocking as she has thought, and Amy's fear of the world reflecting her mother's. Amy is just the type of girl who would be easily seduced by an authority figure like a teacher. Although they may not be the most likeable characters in the world, they certainly are interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and look forward to her next outing."
3,Slow going at times but good.,"Although I enjoyed the overall story, I found the author to be a bit too detailed in some of the settings. Just made for slow going at times. There were some issues which left me feeling unsettled. I felt that either the climax was understated or simply left hanging. If you enjoy this novel, you would probably enjoy the quirky writing of E. Annie Proulx in The Shipping News and Post Cards."
4,"""and it's funny too""","Remember when you first read Oates, Steinbeck, Updike, Kingsolver? -- fill in the blank with a favorite. You fell in love and couldn't wait to read more. Can't wait to tell all my fellow 'bookies'...I've found one! Only it's her first and now I have to go searching for short stories until the next book's done. Complex mother-daughter relationship, awakening sexuality (and the opposite), vivid, small town chit-chat, a circle of rich minor characters and it's funny too."
5,A Touching and Emotional Journey,"Amy and Isabelle are ordinary women who live ordinary lives. But through their ordinary lives the reader discovers a hint of extraordinary courage. The courage to finally let go. Isabelle moves to Shirley Falls with a secret that she keeps very well. Amy has a secret too. She meets and falls in love with an older man who happens to be her math teacher. And when her mother finds out, their lives are changed forever. Elizabeth Strout tells an unforgettable story filled with characters who you will cry with and laugh with. Every mother will want to take Amy into her arms and comfort her and every daughter will beg Isabelle to just understand the plight of her teenage daughter. An extraordinary book about ordinary people you will never forget."
2,depressing,"I didn't see any redeeming qualities. It started off with an awkward girl and her awkward mom, and it just got worse."
4,Poignant tale of a mother and daughter,"I must say there were times during my reading of this book when I wanted to scream at both Amy and Isabelle. Amy for her stupidity and naivety and Isabelle for her rigid and cold demeanor. Amy's obvious need for comfort and love is endearing though and that what's gets her into the situation with Mr. Robertson (what a jerk!) Isabelle's journey though with Amy and her co-workers is hopeful and the end makes you think they will be fine. One particular aspect of the book I enjoyed was how the author takes you into the lives and minds of other characters. Just when Isabelle thinks someone else's life is perfect, we get a glimpse of what their life is really like..ie..Barbara Rawley and Peg Dunlap."
3,An interesting examination of a mother/daughter relationship,"A story about a mother-daughter relationship and some weird and jarring things that happen to change their relationship. I found it interesting enough to finish (which isn't always the case). While I can't say it was stupendous, I can say it was very down to earth and really got into the characters minds to the point where you could believe what they believe and want what they wanted, even when it was coming from an obviously skewed point of view."
2,Didn't like it,"Wow...all I can say is this was the slowest, most predictably bad book I've struggled thru in a long time. I kept waiting for something to happen. Strout's writing style is actually ok but the non-existant plot and troubling characterizations make for a really boring work. I really wanted to like this, as I enjoyed ""Olive Kitteridge."" I wish I could say something positive but my honest review is don't bother, don't waste your time, in other words, forget about this one. Sorry."
3,Amy & Isabelle,"Eh. I could give or take this one but I think it's partly my own fault. I wanted to read this book for so long, I think I built up my expectations of it and I was let down. It wasn't awful, it was actually wasn't 1/2 bad but it wasn't what I expected like I already said."
1,Ugh,"Dull,disappointing and dreadful. I was quite surprised at the favorable jacket blurb from Alice Munro, one of my favorite authors, who does this sort of thing ever so much better. The author obviously sat down and wrote out a plot, then marched her cardboard characters through it -- it certainly does not develop naturally from their characters and conflicts between them. Also many red herrings and pointless diversions as other reviewers have noted. The author also has a tin ear for dialogue; some of the conversations between Amy and her best friend could have been better written by a seventh grader. Buy Alice Munro instead!"
2,Slow and repetitive,"I thought this book was slow and repetitive. How many times did the Amy's hair need to be mentioned? How many times did Fat Bev's stomach problems need to be mentioned? How many times was the terrible heat described? And how many chapters needed to start and end with a description of the flowers and plants surrounding their house or town? I felt really sorry for Isabelle by the way Amy acted towards her, but that's the way teens are. What a sad life Isabelle led...how, in the last chapter, did she suddenly make friends with the women she had worked with for MANY years, find a husband, become closer to her daughter and take a vacation? I can't say I enjoyed this book-but, I wanted to see how it ended, and I found that disappointing."
4,Slow to warm up,"It took me several days to ""warm up"" to the characters in the book, but after a while, I could not put it down. I did find myself looking forward to the sections focusing on Amy and Isabelle rather than the other characters such as the office women. I also found my eyes ""skimming"" over the lengthy paragraphs describing the weather and surroudings. Mr. Robertson's perspective was definetely missing-leaving me curious as to what was true and what was Amy's perception (maybe the point the author was going for). Overall, I did enjoy reading the story and would be interested in seeing the movie."
2,negative,"Agree with those who were disappointed in this book. Too many unresolved issues and I lost interest in characters early on. There were too many sub-plots, ie, pregnant friend, her father, the mother's past. boss and co-workers at mill, death of girl, etc. Just seemed muddled."
2,I was very disappointed in this book.,"I found the characters shallow and one dimensionable. This tired plot has been written many times and the outcome was too predictable. I found the end totally improbable. From all the hye, I thought it would be a better read."
2,Boring characters make for a boring read,Sorry to contradict other readers but I found this book a chore to get through. The characters were one dimensional and when the secrets that ought to be transformational are revealed it turns out to be a non event. This book validates a reader's rule I've created that says you can't make a compelling book out of boring characters. You also can't show lives being lived out by repeating the same interactions 100 times. Maybe real life is like that but one purpose of fiction is to make real life more engaging. I did read the whole thing just to see if I could find what other's had seen in the book but it never got better. Sorry.
3,"A good book, but not something to read in one sitting","I found this book to be really well written. It was nice to have bits of future events to be helpful in seeing how events shapped peoples lives. It was a little scary how because of one childhood incident Amy gets her kicks out of ""nrrdy men"". I did feel that Isabelle hung onto the circumstances a bit too long. But I can also sympathize with her about her shyness coming across as being snobbish. This book is definately not meant for a one sitting book, it is to heavy and really makes you think. But overall a good book."
1,Misery Start to Finish,"This book is just thin, and it starts out depressing and gloomy and stays that way throughout the book. Bluk!"
1,I would give it ZERO stars if I could!,"This is one of the more boring books I have ever read! I don't understand why people are giving it such good reviews! To me, it was like she was trying to see how long of a book she could write, by randomly sticking in people here and there, and always spending WAY too much time describing the weather, and the scenery along the road. The 'sex scene' between Amy and her math teacher went way too far in describing it. We all have an imagination, and didn't need her graphic description to get her point through.Luckily, I got this book from the library, so I didn't waste my money on it. And I would suggest that you don't waste your money either! It gets NO recommendation from me."
2,reads like a supermarket novel,"Originally, when I read this book, I thought it was going to be a deep exploration of mother/daughter relationship and a ""literary gem"". It turns out to read like a little paperback, it's certainly not literary. I found the small town setting to be too stereotypical. I thought a lot of the side stories were undeveloped and the characters were one-dimensional. It was almost like the author needed some filling to keep the story from becoming just about mom and daughter. It felt like I was ""reading"" a soap opera and not a very good one. Because of its soap opera quality, the story line was totally predictable. Also, I found Isabelle and Amy to be very annoying people, especially Isabelle. It was hard to sympathize with her."
3,"Slow Starting, Difficult to stay with ...",I wanted to enjoy this book as it had been recommended to me. It was so slow in getting going that I often put it down and would force myself to start it again. Finally half way through it picked up a bit. A Mother-Daughter saga with a handful of less than inspiring relationships. If you can muddle through to the middle it will hold your interest to the end. It is well written but so much is just unnecessary babbling. With the reviews written I had expected much more.
4,Mothers & Daughters--It Ain't Easy!,"Amy & Isabelle is a moving story about relationships. It teaches us that those we love, while often disappointing us, are still dear to us. It teaches us to be understanding of others and that often, we need only look as close as the image in our own mirror to better understand the weaknesses in those we love. Elizabeth Strout has written a moving story about just such a relationship...a relationship about ordinary people who confront all too common hardships among themselves and the people they come to know and love. ""Amy & Isabelle"" inspires the reader to seek out others and to cherish the relationships they already have. A wonderful book."
4,different to what l imagined,"The front cover of this book led me totally astray. I read the edition that had a picture of the interior of a car door, and I expected a 'travelling' novel.Instead I got a story of an uncomfortable relationship of a mother and daughter, stuck in the heat of summer in a small town. Daughter Amy is in need of affection and sets her sights on her math teacher who makes her feel special. Mother Isabelle is a nervy quiet woman, trying to fit into a small community without the locals discovering her past.There are many sad and awkward moments in this book, as the community begin to learn more of Amy and Isabelle and their lives, good and bad.All in all it is an interesting read of a dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship interspersed with other town characters, some well written, others a little one dimensional."
3,"Not the greatest, but not a total loss either.","This book was off to a slow start and really did not get good until its last quarter when, finally, things started to happen! The author successfully captured the complexities of the mother-daughter relationship here and did a great job developing Amy's character. Overall, it was worth the push to the satisfying last few chapters."
3,wonderful writing but lots of loose ends and red herrings,"I have great admiration for the writing in this first novel, and there is no question about Strout's talent, or future. And I will seek out her next book, and the one after. But this novel just didn't deliver all that it promised. There are too many red herrings and loose ends and Omens and Portents that foreshadow events without actually illuminating anything. I just didn't understand, in the end, certain key plot elements. Nervous tics of the fledgling, perhaps. Dan Menaker is a wonderful writer and a terrific editor but he could have/should have brought his own editing genius to bear on Strout's brilliant but undisciplined talent. It would have been a better book. It should have been a better book."
3,Merely O.K.,Another take on the traditional mother-daughter struggle. I'm still waiting for a fresh approach!
2,"almost, but not quite","Frankly, I was disappointed in this book. It got good reviews and I felt like it was a good story idea, but the characters were all so unlikeable. Amy, the daughter and one of the protaganists has no depth to her character. All we seem to know about her is she has pretty hair and hates her mom. Her relationship with her ""best friend"" Stacy is pointless and entirely based on cigarettes and relentlessly talking about their parents as assholes. Very tiring. I know it's been awhile since I was in High School, but I know I had more meaningful relationships with my friends than this stereotypical picture of teenage angst. Isabelle, the mother, is equally unlikeable, but at least provokes sympathy because her life is so pitiful. Although I ultimately found this novel very readable, it was so irritating that I sort of wanted to throw it away when I finished. I would recommend this to friends, but only so we could discuss how annoying Amy and Isabelle were."
2,"I was hopeful, but alas...","A more appropriate title for this novel would have been ""Amy and Her Neurotic Mother Who We Don't Care About."" The character of Amy was well done and I would have liked to get more into her head, see her as the storyteller, even. Skipping POV from Amy to Isabelle to the myriad of people in town (was anyone else lost trying to remember who was married to or the lover of whom?) was distracting and left little room to get into Isabelle's character. I really wanted to love this book, and in fact the prose was lovely, but ultimately I didn't like Isabelle at all, and cared little for anything she had to say or think. Having said that, however, I'm willing to try a second novel should one appear, just because I think she has potential as a writer."
1,sad and depressing,I found this book not at all interesting. I thought I was goingto like it but it seemed to wander off into the boring realm anddefinately depressing. I did not understand what the point of the book was to show how awful it can be to have no husband live in an awful little town have some really sad friends. I could also have done without the sex chapters I think she could have left that out and we still would have got the picture of a young girl being taken advantage of by her teacher. It did not add to the value of this book. It could have been a Jerry Springer show. It also reminded me of a novel made for magazines were the ending is all nicely wrapped up. I will not wait with anticipation for her next book.
5,"Intricate, magnificent, lovely","I want to know if readers think that the Professor killed Debby Kay. He had the ""slight southern accent"" that was revealed on the call where Amy found him after the discovery of the body. The obscene caller to Amy had the ""southern"" accent. What gives here? Was he the guy whose murder of Amy was interrupted by Isabelle's boss?"
3,Mothers and Daughters?,"There was something missing in this story of a mother and a daughter. Overall, the plot was predictable. There were no startling revelations. And the characters' isolation was so profound that even the reader felt cut off from them. The era was unclear - though described as the early seventies, it felt like it could be any time in a small town. The only true-to-life thing was Isabelle's rich fantasy life. And the background story of the summer of a kidnapping went grossly unresolved. All in all, I was disappointed that the conclusion wasn't stronger and because of that, was disappointed in the novel as a whole."
2,Not for me.,"A realistic view of the depressing, dark, gloomy, dirty side of life. I'm so glad my life is not so pathetic. I, too, found the characters, such as Amy and Stacy too steoreotypical of teenagers to the negative side; smoking, cussing, hating their parents. I found the book slow moving and had a hard time getting through it. The descriptions were good, though, and I think the author can write well, but choose something less dark, gloomy, and depressing."
2,Ultimately Predictable,"AMY & ISABELLE is the story of the classic conflict between a mother and her adolescent daughter taken to a fictional extreme...the novel is beautifully written. Still...the plot and, especially, the conclusion ultimately is predictable."
3,A struggle,"When I read Olive Kitteridge, I found myself rationing how much I COULD read on a given day. That was because I did not want the book to end. The characters were compelling, complex and full of life. But with Amy and Isabelle, I found myself assigning myself pages to complete so that I could finish the book. I kept hoping that a spark of life would enliven the very hot summer which is the unfortunate center of this book. I found the characters complex but, in the end, not very interesting. In many ways, some of the minor characters were more compelling than were the title ones. And for those who like minituae, there is a friendly pharmacist in this story who becomes, I would believe, Olive's very interesting husband. But I find it hard to recommend this book--something that I have not stop doing with Olive."
4,Great read,"This was a great book of a mother and daughter, with plenty of detail to make it more realistic. I did enjoy the extra minor characters, as they added a bit more to the story."
3,"Stark, honest, but a bit trite","Amy and Isabelle is more than a typical mother daughter story. Isabelle (the mother) is lonely, bitter, hiding secrets, and in love with her boss. Amy, the daughter, is having her first sexual experiences and being a typical teenager. The story is horrifying in some aspects - Amy's teacher takes complete advantage of her, and Isabelle is jealous of Amy, instead of truly angry at the teacher. Both main characters are alone for most of the story, and finally reach out and make friends towards the end. The end was too neatly done, but it did leave the reader with hopes that Isabelle and Amy will be able to love each other as mother and daughter, instead of fear and resent each other."
1,HATED IT,I was waiting for the story to begin. It never did. I was truly disgusted by the only in-depth description in this story; the disgusting affair between a minor and an authority figure.
3,I live in Maine and this book made me depressed!,"I bought the book because my name is Amy and my daughter's name is Isabelle and we live in Maine! However, what a bummer of a life! I wanted to shake the mom...wake up! Thank goodness my life is nothing like their's and Maine is a beautiful, wonderful place to live...even the run down mill towns!"
4,fine,Took a little longer than I had hoped to receive the item but product is just as described in ad
4,Nice cami,"The camisoles came as a package of three, were well made, very nice material, pretty good fit, and the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars was that they are very long! I don't like waist skimmers, but these are long enough to sit on. Fortunately, I sew, so it wasn't much to make them the length I wanted, but others may not be so lucky. But they are very nice otherwise."
1,Look stupid,These look extremely stupid. You are better off just getting a clear pair if you need to hide your gauges.
1,Family Edited Version?!,"When I bought this, I was expecting the real true movie... wrong! They took out a lot of the movie and edited a lot of stuff. I mean it's a good movie, but why cut parts out??? Wasn't happy about that at all!"
2,Wasn't as robust.,"This is a family/time compressed version.There are certain points missing in the movie.It was alright, but wasn't what I was expecting."
5,Funniest movie.,"We saw this movie on TV when the kids were young, and I was happy to find it on Amazon so they can see it again. I still enjoy it every time they watch it."
3,Decent basic phonograph needle- nothing special,"This is a decent, servicable needle, and the only such cartridge available, as far as I have been able to find.It would be nice to have the option of a better product, but for the price this is serviceable at my level of audio sophistication. Audiophiles will opt for a system that includes better reproduction options, but the Teac unit that I use is basic and simple, and no such option exists."
5,Worked like a charm,Found and ordered these needles for my player and it was super easy to install. They shipped on time and they work amazingly well.
3,Mortal Sin (Kindle edition),"Having read other books in the Jake Lassiter series, I knew this would be interesting suspense. However, I found the story to be a little far-fetched. Too many times, Jake finds himself in situations where he should have been killed and finds a last minute escape. Once would have been ok, but by the third time it seemed silly.The book starts with Jake defending Nicky Florio, and getting him off, even though Jake believes there is more to the story. He starts looking further and gets himself into something unexpected that keeps expanding.I often find myself suspending reality to read, but with this book, I was more aware of the stretch than usual. For me, that detracted from the book. In addition, I read the Kindle version and there were enough typos that it interfered with the flow of the book."
2,Dissapointed,"After reading the Solomon & Lord series which I love, I decided to try another Paul Levine's series - with Jake Lassiter. What a dissapointment. Aside of some, unnecessary in my opinion, detailed descriptions of murders, I found this book a little boring. I don't think I'll read any other of Jake Lassiter books."
5,"Great read, lots of action, great settings in South Florida","I'm not usually enthusiastic about ""lawyer"" books, but this one exceeded my expectations by a mile.Easy to enjoy, fast-paced, good dialog, nice twisty story line, easy-to-relate-to main character. I will definitely be reading more Jake Lassiter books."
4,Mortal Sin,One of the better books in the Jake Lassiter Series. Enjoyed it thoroughly.I found it a bit more thoughtful and surprising.
5,A WINNER!,"This character captured me from the get-go! It was one of those books I couldn't put down, and I hated to come to the end of it because it was so engrossing! But then....this is the Jake Lassiter SERIES, and I will read all of them!"
4,Still reading...,"I've downloaded quite a few Kindle books since getting my e-reader in November. I have a lot to get through but this novel has kept me reading each night. I'm enjoying the story and the style it's written in. I had no idea this was one of a series based on the same character, but I would definitely download more once I get through my reading list.Nice suspense, and great voice."
3,OK Book but unbelievable rescue,"This book is my first Paul Levine, and I liked it fairly well. The Jake Lassiter character is agreeable and you begin to care what happens to him - the essential ingredient for a good book in my opinion. The plot is interesting, if not too obvious. What lowered my review to 3 stars from 4 was the completely unbelievabe rescue of Lassiter from the Everglades. I won't spoil the plot for anyone who might decide to read the book, but sufice it to say I thought this was so absurd I almost put the book down. I'm glad I didn't, but it is a major flaw in the book."
4,Action-packed.,"I really enjoyed this gritty mystery and the loser aspects of its protagonist, Jake Lassiter, made him very human. I actually laughed out loud at some of the things that happened and the things they said. I look forward to reading more about Jake."
3,Gullibility and Violence,Main character needs a backbone when it comes to girlfriend. There was a very graphic description in several places of violence. Too gross in my opinion.
5,A very underrated ISENGARD album,"Fenriz is a dark mastermind and gets to show his fullest potential in any ISENGARD album. While the first 7 songs are no doubt the best, the other songs must be appreciated by true DARKTHRONE fans. Fenriz' voice is almost shriek-for-shriek compared to Nocturnal Culto and guitars are,as always, thrashing."
4,THE BEST AND WORST,"In short. You get the rarest experience in film history - THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT with its wonderful commentary and other features. You get the WORST FILM in history - JOE BERLINGER'S WASTE of film Blair Witch 2 - Book of Bad Filmmaking. But you get all 3 acclaimed Blair Witch Video Games, the BW2 soundtrack and maybe more! This is worth its low cost. Collect a phenomenom at one low price!"
3,could have been the ultimat blair experience...,"if you're into boxed sets, you come to expect a little extra. the pc games are an o.k. add, but i think it was done because they couldn't give the game away any other way.maybe with the third film coming out, they'll head my advice when they release it on dvd.the ultimate bw exp needs to come out that includes the following:1.) the blair witch project, the burkittsville 7 and curse of the BW on one or two dvds and all the other HBO and Sci-Fi tie-ins that made this unreal reality so exhillerating. the side shows (no pun intended) are great support for the reality that Myrick and Sánchez were trying to convey.2.) BW2, the shadow of the blair witch, and the scooby-doo project on this dvd. one good spoof deserves another. the magic is exposed so why not enjoy the kamp.3.)BW3 and all it's follies4.) the josh mix cd5.) the BW2 cd (including Burwell's soundtrack)6.) the BW3 soundtracksoh, and a stick man necklace!"
3,"Didn't receive as advertised, no response from seller......................","Received the dvd's, one of the dvd cases was cracked and broken, the outside Amazon box was in perfect condition. So, it was put in the box to be shipped broken, wow, amazing what they try to push off on people. Oh, and the necklace was NOT included, although it was listed as one of the items in the set.....Poor quality control and not as advertised. Won't be buying from this supplier again."
5,Holy cow thats funny,"This was the first episode of Coupling I ever saw and I was laughing so hard at parts (the giggle loop, specifically) that I was in tears.Good stuff."
3,Not sure,"I'm not sure this product did anything special. Then again, maybe it did.Yes, my dog's teeth are cleaner but was it because of this product or was it because I was brushing her teeth twice a day?I don't have much of this product left so I plan to switch to a regular dog toothpaste and I'll see if the plaque returns."
1,Dog got gastric reflux at first use - avoid,"Brandy, just hated it. Had to return it. She got stomach aches and acid reflux after 2 use of it. I didn't see a noticeable improvement of her teeth. Returned the damn item, they charged me $6 for shipping, so got almost nothing back."
2,My dog hates this!,"I ordered a bottle of this gel last year, and my dog absolutely loved it. I had no trouble putting it on his teeth, and he would even lick it off of my hand. I recently ordered a bottle of the salmon oil gel, and he went crazy when I put it in his mouth, shaking his head and slinging saliva everywhere. I decided to try the peppermint gel, and the same thing happened. Something in this gel does not agree with my dog, and I would never use this on him again. So now I am back to using a toothbrush and toothpaste, which he does not mind at all. I emailed Petz Life about this and asked if I could get a gel without a flavor like the first bottle I ordered, but they have never responded!"
4,I believe it works,"I use it as toothpaste on Henry's toothbrush, so I believe it works in that regard, but I've never used it just by itself without brushing so can't speak for that. I wish it came in a pump or easier to squeeze bottle."
2,PetzLife Oral Care Gel Original Peppermint 4 oz.,"I initially reviewed the pink cream PetzLife Oral Care Cream approximately 4-5 years ago.It was a terrific product that eliminated my rescues' serious dental health problems--bleeding gums, significant plaque ridden teeth, loose teeth, and poor quality breath. I rated it as a miracle product.I have recently started using the peppermint gel and I find that it is not as effective on my dogs' teeth as the original cream.It did not adhere to the teeth and it tends to be too thin. I went back to using the thicker cream in the much larger size, and it was not as effective as it was 4-5 years earlier.I do not know what has changed about the product, but it no longer provides the quality it once did."
4,acarrera,"What can I say? I've tried other products and they may have helped a little, but this one actually works."
1,Not Safe!!!,"Please be careful when using this product! My dog developed bilious vomiting syndrome the day I used this product, after just one time use! I had to give her meds to treat the condition. This is obviously too harsh for delicate stomaches!"
1,Did not work,I got Zero results with this product. I used it as directed twice a day. Applied it with a toothbrush or q-tip. I saw no results at all - not even on my dog's teeth that were just starting to show signs of tartar. I bought the gel after reading comments for the gel vs spray. Don't see how the product stays on long enough to work. My dog allowed me to apply it but did not like the product whereas she likes pet toothpaste. It has a strong peppermint smell. I purchased it based on the reviews here but was disappointed.
4,"It works, somehow","It wasn't until the second bottle that I was actually able to chip away at the plaque/calculus that was firmly attached to my dog's teeth. During the second bottle I decided to try to combine it with Proden Plaque off in his food, and finally saw some improvement.Overall it works, but it really does take some time."
5,Petzlife Oral Care Gel,"Product works wonderfully. Used the finger toothbrush I have for my dog, and she didn't mind it at all. Her breath improved in 3-4 days!! Don't think the spray worked as well - my dog did not like me spraying so close to her face and eyes. The gel is perfect.Thanks."
3,"Cat, shall we say, is resistant to this product","Well, I've got a full container. Still.My cat feels the stuff on his lips as I try and sneak it in there and the ears go so far back it's incredible. Definitely a product that requires forcing.I sort of wonder if it's the alcohol content that causes his reaction more than the mint flavor. I think I might call this one a no go and try the stuff you sprinkle on their food."
4,Petzlife oral care for dogs,"Great stuff. Use it at least once daily and your dog's teeth will look cleaner with 30 days. If you skip a day and restart, it is like starting the product all over again."
4,It seems to work fine. The dog likes it.,"We've used this for a while sometimes instead of brushing the dog's teeth, we just rub this along. We think it works, it seems to be good for his teeth so thats a good thing."
4,Review of PetLife Oral Care Gel,I used this product on my dog's teeth and within a couple of weeks there was significantly less tartar. It is easy to apply. The product performed as advertised.
4,any improvement is good,I'm a little cautious with using products such as this one with my senior dachshund. However it has definitely lessened the plaque buildup on her teeth and has improved her breath considerably. I only use it about 4 times per week (again due to her age and sensitivity). I figure in between vet cleanings (every year to 18 months) it's not hurting but improving slightly.
2,Softened tartar but made my dogs sick,"I initially rated this item 5 stars because it worked well and quickly at softening the tartar which allowed it to flake off. However, both of my dogs (15 year old border collies) started to get sick after about 6 days on the product. They started vomiting and got diarrhea. My other dogs that were not on the product did not get sick so I attribute the digestive upset to this oral gel. I used less than the recommended amount, but perhaps the product is just too strong for elderly dogs' digestive systems.In summary, the product worked well at softening plaque but the digestive side effect was troublesome. I switched to an algae powder food additive that worked much more slowly but didn't make my dogs sick (Proden Plaqueoff, which I also got through the Amazon site)."
2,Doesn't work,"My dogs have a small amount of plaque on the back teeth. Being a new dog owner, I didn't know I should brush their teeth until they were six months. I brush them every day now but would like to get rid of the initial build up. So this old plaque is over one year old. I took photographs over the two months I tried this product and noticed no difference. Maybe it works better on ""new plaque"" that is just building up."
