1,A complete rip off,"I didnt like it, it is only 10ML and not so affective. I feel that it is a complete rip off of money. I feel like all those positive reviews are a fake."
2,25% Manuka oil,"I was disappointed to receive this and find out it is just 25% Manuka oil, diluted in a carrier oil. I like to use Manuka oil directly on my face to fight break outs, as I find it very gentle to use on my face, but I don't want to put other oils as well, so this item is not what I was wanting, and it is not labeled on Amazon as such."
1,Why??????,This season was douchebags and dumb girls on parade. It was awful and everyone involved should be humiliated. What's with MTV? Where are the older seasons? Where is San Fran and Boston and Seattle? These new ones are all about being trashy and disgusting and blacking out every night.
5,DW Picolo Tom,"I have all 3 of these and they are a great addition to an acoustic kit. I think these are great value, well made and I love the sound so.........have a go. I use a DW Collectors kit and these toms do add a different dimension and ..............they do look good also."
3,o.k. drum,"This drum is fine its just that it looks you get three but you only get 1 ,but its a pretty quality drum"
5,Strange but beautiful story,"Even though this book appears to be a children's book with its beautiful illustrations, I feel that it's an adult story and a beautiful and rather strange one. Definitely a wonderful book for a goose lover's collection."
2,A question on the premise?,"The heroine of the story is a widow. She is deemed by others (and herself) to be a ""fallen woman"" b/c a while after becoming a widow, she embarks on a liaison with a gentleman that includes sexual intimacy. I guess her lover was indiscreet about the nature of their relationship.In any case, I have read many Regency/historical romance books, and in them, it's generally presented that widowhood frees a woman to do as she wishes. Also, it seems common for married Regency couples to take on lovers, especially after an heir has been presented. So given that level of permissiveness, why was it such a big deal for the widowed heroine of this book to have a lover? She was not a courtesan or prostitute.Other than this huge question, the book was fairly enjoyable. I liked that there was emotional growth on the part of the heroine and the hero. Their love felt believable, in the end."
2,No depth,"The book started out pretty good probably because there isn't much expectation from the characters at the beginning but as the story progresses you expect more depth and substance. It never gets there. Unfortunately, I found the characters to be very shallow and the writing to be juvenile. There story reads more like an accounting of events so as a reader, i never developed any sort of connection with the characters. The characters themselves just feel unrealistic. There isn't too much range of emotions that they display and when they do, you don't really understand where they're coming from because there is no character development. I paid 99 cents for this book and not even worth that. At the end, i skipped the long narrations and just stuck to the dialogue just to get to the end of the story."
4,Fun Read,"I really enjoyed this book. You feel for Carlotta and James. I like that they fell in love slowly. I also liked the importance that was put on her son, Stevie."
5,Nice little romp,"I liked the flow and the energy of this story. I got caught up in the plot almost immediately. Cheryl Bolen can set a very nice mood with her descriptions of Victorian London and Bath, and the lady always gets her man!"
1,heroine destroys book...,"I won't go into the premise of the book as others have summed it up. I will just state that I agree with the others that this was a perplexing, poorly written book.Carlotta, in my opinion, is no heroine. You get right away that she is a schemer, a neglectful mother, and very much a ""party"" girl who has no prospects because of a scandal she brought on herself.She's a woman who has an affair, is even TOLD by her lover that he will never marry her-then lo and behold-she's shocked when Bath society turns on her when her affair becomes public news?!?Sorry-but a really bad book. Take my advice and skip it."
1,"A Fallen Woman (Brides of Bath, Book 3)","I found ""A Fallen Woman (Brides of Bath, Book 3)"" very boring. Most of the book was concerned with how wonderful the hero and heroine were."
1,Ads for photographers in this book,It's mainly used as an introduction to the works of the photographers featured in this book. The text included by each photographer is so brief that you'd learn almost zero from them. The range of photographers in there is pretty wide: you have big names like Art Morris and you also have photos from some others which are really weak.
4,torn,"Had it ben set in modern times I would have raged on this story, but the rich characters and setting won my heart.enjoyable story and fun"
3,Cowboy sci-fi,Really would give it 3.45 stars. Was a fun book with simple but engaging characters. Set in the 1800s or so somewehere cowboys vs creepy crawly critters - but surprisingly it worked! Would say it's along the lines one of the better (made for Syfy movies you might stumble across. Like most of those Syfy flux it just pure mind candy
2,Just not in to little Hairy Guys,"If you Love Giant Scorpions and Little Hairy Guys, you might like this easy read. I was hoping it would be a cool ""Jurassic Park"", ""Lost World"", ""Western"", ""Adventure"" and although it had some likable characters, I just got tired of the Scorpions and thought the little Hairy Guys were lame - I wanted 6 shooters vs. Velociraptors. Very Disappointing"
3,unsatisfing,"I found the book good enough to read it front to back. I found the characters interesting if underdeveloped, the concept good enough to justify the price, and the writing acceptable. However, upon finishing the book I found my self unsatisfied and I'm darned if I can pinpoint why. My best guess is that it just barely missed mark on all those points. Close enough so I don't regret spending the money but not good enough to bring me back. If it is a stormy day, if you have nothing else of interest around to read give it a try, maybe it's just me.MikeG"
4,Very fun,"It's 1863 during the Montana gold rush and a group of people want a pie of the gold pie. But what they walk into is not what they expected. I found this novel really fun and had a bit of a deeper meaning to it by the end that was well played out. ""We did this, we need to fix it"". I found the writing entertaining and enjoyable :)"
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could!,"PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed! Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged. I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery. That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem. I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo. Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least. So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Way too expensive for what you are getting, plus don't even think about moving to a new place with it. It was a waste of my money. It chips easily (it's pressed board)."
5,Pelican M-6 Flashlight,"I purchased for my wife for her late night dog walks and she finds this flashlight small but powerful! Easily fits into a coat pocket or the palm of your hand and the beam is brite and strong. We have both dropped a few times, but the hard casing makes it very durable and dependable."
1,Not Good.,"I bought two (2) Pelican M6 2330 LED Flashlights to take with me to an off-shore job site. I failed to check them before I departed. The tail cap on one flashlight can't be removed! It seems to be froze one. Yes, I tried a wrench! I also tried installing the batteries from the other end. Flashlight does not work. The second flashlight the tail cap will not thread on to the flashlight body. If you get a chance to look at one, check out the treads. You will see it is made of some type of soft pot-metal, and it's galled up and crosses really easy. It's not made of steel. Simply put, these things are junk. They look to be well made, black finish, etc. Reminds me of a quality Surefire light, but I can assure you that these are junk, and not even close to Suefire quality. I sent a note to Pelican's Customer Service, but so far they have ignored my concerns. $150.00 waste of money."
2,Push button switch is unreliable,"After about a year, the push button switch on my unit does not operate reliably. I've had it apart numerous times to try and find something wrong with it, but there are no obviously broken parts. The switch end cap can be disassembled to some degree, but not completely. There are some parts that can't be removed, and I expect the problem lies within those parts. Usually, just taking it apart and reassembling it, will cause the switch to start operating normally. Unfortunately, the problem returns after a while. I need something more reliable, so I'm going to buy something different. The construction of the M6 seems to be quite durable, so it's too bad the switch has problems. Because of the switch problems, I cannot recommend this product."
3,Fishbone is Great!! DVD not so much.,"If you like watching people work in the studio, you'll love this. Watching people work in the studio can be annoying because, as a musician, it can be a lot of work and headaches (which is evident in this dvd). Another problem is the DVD does not give you full versions of the songs, just clips from songs that they are working on that never been released,... as of yet. So why did I give it 3 stars? INSIGHTS!! The DVD gave me some insights of their ideas and what goes on in their minds (mostly ganja, which they make obvious) as they work. Angelo, Dirty Walt, and Norwood all talk a little about their history and inspirations, so in this aspect it can be used as a tool for creativity for musicians. Certainly you could find more insights reading the autobiography of Quincy Jones, Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and etc...but this is Fishbone!! Anyway I still support this band because they make me 'skank & go nutts'!!!"
1,An Unauthorized Scam on Fishbone!!!!!,The band is not being compensated for thier creative genious! This DVD is not supporting FISHBONE it is ripping them off and if you buy this without FISHBONE getting compensated for it you are doing them an injustice. This band deserves more than they have ever gotten for thier musical rightousness! Please buy thier new release DVD/CD Live in Amsterdam instead if you respect the work that they do for you!
1,DONT BUY THIS,FISHBONE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY DONT APPROVE OF THIS DVD. FISHBONE RELEASED A DVD THEMSELVES BUY THAT ONE.
4,Relive the glory days of Beatlemania!,"Take a quick trip back to 1964. The place is New York City and the setting is the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. That halcyon time of innocence and gaity, screaming mobs of female (and male) fans and that paragon of early TV, Ed Sullivan, who brought entertainment into the lives of ordinary Americans every Sunday Night. Six teenagers from New Jersey descend upon New York City to meet their idols, the Beatles. It is a bit wild, very funny and sometimes poignant."
2,Not what I remembered,"I had seen this movie once years ago on TV, and I recalled a fun filled romp. So when I started buying the Beatles albums on CD, this movie came to mind. I bought it, and boy was I shocked! It was rated PG, but the language was horrible. I've heard less swearing in a PG-13 and R rated movie. I don't mind some swearing, but this movie had way too much. Not for children.There were scenes that I loved, like when the Nancy Allen character got into the Beatles' hotel room, and her Paul obsessed friend who was trying to get a ticket to Ed Sullivan.There were other scenes I defintely didn't like, and sure weren't on the TV version, but I won't go into detail here...might get my review banned.Not at all what I remembered."
2,Might Have Been a Decent Short Story,"I've read the majority of Schow's short stories and two of his novels (The Shaft & The Riff) enjoying most, but Rock Breaks Scissors Cut was a chore to wade through. It seemed like an overblown short story and wasn't very impressive. The characters are bland and the ending 'twist' wasn't exactly the most surprising. Save your money, go buy one of his short story collections."
5,"Great Cd May 15, 1999 8:22p.m.","This cd was good he sang really good. The sond i liked the best was ""El Dinero No Es La Vida"" Andrea Pedro Fernandez's #1 Fan"
4,Pen of choice,"Usually flows well, but will skip too. Still use it for all my scientific documenting, though it should be more reliable."
3,Greatly disappointed,"INdian is perhaps my favorite cuisine & I've been to allot of Indian restaurants and own several books. This one though was mediocre at best. Allot flash in the pan, nothing spectacular though it was nice to see the book divided into 6 chapters for the 6 regions of the subcon.I think that the sisters tried to make the recipes harder & more complicated than they are in the name of authenicity. Most of these recipes were very elaborate with lots of steps.I would recommend Lord Krishna's book, Julie Sahni's or one Madhur Jaffrey's early books instead."
3,"Not a 'Must-Have', but still worthwhile","I collect cooking books and have a massive collection, with a fair emphasis on east Indian cuisine. This book rose above the herd because it has a decent discussion of history and tradition etc, and is well organized. The recipes are fairly pedestrian (ie: not that very different than you can find in other Indian cookbooks), but I wa not sorry I bought it."
2,Really Hard Read,"I can read Kant (ok, not all) or Byzantine history with considerable relish, but this was a hard read. I think it needs an erudition past a couple degrees. There were nuggets, but too hard to get to."
1,sun-drenched gardens,"I thought that I bought a new copy of the book, Sun-Drenched Gardens, however, even though it was covered in old plastic wrap, it was very moldy and makes me sick when I read it. I did not send it back due to the hassle of it all."
4,Defines the Aesthetic,"This an important work for those concerned with garden design. There are many examples of the Mediterranean Style, with emphasis on French, Italian, and Californian interpretations. The volume is light on text and heavy on pictures (and they are of exceptional quality). At times, the captions neglect to inform the reader of the dominant plant's identity. This is a good introductory volume for the hobbyist and would be a valuable tool for designers to use with clients to clarify and illustrate the style. Great advocacy for use of drought tolerant plants."
4,Good overview of the mediterranean garden,"Living in Colorado, sun-drenched, low-water gardens are pretty much required (at least in my yard: I have about 10 sq. ft. of shade). This book provides an attractive overview of the Mediterranean garden style using some textual descriptions and many photos, with an emphasis on pics of Italian and southern California gardens. Even though many of the classic Mediterranean garden plants are not hardy for me, this book is still useful for studying the structure and design elements of a Mediterranean garden. My only complaint is that the photos appear washed out. I'm sure this was deliberate --- these are ""sun-drenched"" gardens, after all --- but it makes the detailed structure and the individual plants difficult to discern."
1,This product is very runny please don't buy!,"Runny product. I should have listened to the other people who wrote the same reviews. The customer service can only tell me to shake the product? It is almost like water as if they have diluted the sample. The product does not come with a seal which makes me even weary to use it. I have used other over the counter skin care so even if it is not sealed, it looks like no one has touch it because it is compacted and not runny. I suggest don't buy."
2,Didn't really care for it,I have been searching for a new product for my very dry skin. I have eczema and I need a lot of moisture for my skin. This product just didn't cut it. I prefer Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream.
5,Skikai Products,"Shikai Products has done wonders for my dry skin, this product has help me out alot during the winter months"
2,Not for formatted for kindle right.,This book has not been formatted right for kindle. The table of contents is only for the 12 months of the year. If you want to find a saint go to the index which is not clickable. For example to look up a saint go to the index find the saint's name then after the saint it gives you the day and month for the saint ---- now go back to the table of contents find the month and page forward till you get to the saint.If you want to read this book all in one big lump then the deal price might be ok but I'm returning mine.
5,Love this book,This book is such an inspiration. Ms. Gallick has thoroughly researched each saint and there is an extensive bibilography at the end to allow the reader to research more information if they choose.
1,Awful,"A truly banal and seriously dreadful 'cross-over' CD. I hated it. Ms von Otter's considerable talents lie elsewhere, as we all know."
3,Disappointed!,"Although this study quotes many sources it also leaves out significant information. Yes there was some information that pointed to Japan attacking Pearl Harbor but there was also credible appearing information that pointed to Japan attacking other places. The conclusion that FDR was motivated to an earlier golden age where the USA ruled the UK is incredibly weak. I recommend ""Pearl Harbor: FDR Leads the Nation into War"" by Gillon for a more balanced view."
1,"Hate to disagree, but...","...I found this book practically useless. Its summaries of the plays leave out major portions, the analyses are over-simplified, (even for high schoolers) and the ""extras"" are usually useless info about 20 year old film versions no one is interested in. It is funny, and at times provided an interesting tidbit or two, but for something meatier, REALLY read the sparknotes version free online or at Barnes and Noble."
5,Behringer GMX 212,"Awsome amp, for the money. I have been playing guitar for over 35 years, and have owned a lot of different amps in my day. And one amp just isnt enough anymore. I do a lot of recording and experamenting with sound, and this amp has plenty. This amp has (3) different amp models and a boat load of great sounding effects. This amp has a decent amount of power, and could be used in small to mid sized venues, it will get over the drums no problem. Amp also has MIDI and (3) different gain and speaker simulations. So if your looking for a combo amp with tons of versatility, and a fair amount of power, you will not find more bang for your buck than this little gem. This is my second behringer amp, and I have a lot of other behringer products. They have all held up well and done right by me. Behringer sometimes gets a bad rap because they are inexpensive, but those peaple are just haters. So buy with confadence, and God Bless!"
5,Georgia Bulldogs- University of NCAA Football Infant/baby Onesie Jersey 12-18 months,I love this Jersey.. I bought it big so it would fit my son come time for the next season and cant wait for him to be able to wear it!
5,Charles Solomon was too Harsh on this One,"Usually, I find myself agreeing with animation critic Charles Solomon's views but he's wrong about this one...I'm a twenty-four year old man and I find this series to be engaging, touching and funny all at the same time. It offers a realistic and likeable heroine, a horrible, scheming witch and a funny, mischievous young vagabond who actually cares but puts up a front of just being a skirt-chasing pervert. You'll enjoy it...take a chance on Peach Girl!"
4,It's a wild ride. Very nerve wrecking,"Peach Girl is a good series. It's definitely meant for girls. That doesn't mean that a dude can't find it entertaining. Emotions don't have sex boundary. Momo is a high school girl who has a crappy best friend and 2 really cool guys that want to date her. Her best friend is determined to make her life hell. This anime explores her relationships with both of her guy friends and the decision she makes on which one to become lovers with. Momo is a great character. You really feel for the troubles she encounters, and want her to be happy.The animation in this series is pretty good. The voice acting is as well. I've always liked Cherami Leigh. She's not the main character, but she's great. The soundtrack in this is also very fitting. It's a very drama and it keeps you wanting more. I highly recommend it. Especially to a younger teenage audience."
4,great product,"This is a product that works, because my mother keeps asking me to order more for her. Although beware of the ""prime shipping"" -- it doesn't necessarily mean that you will get it in two days. If you need it in a hurry then check the actual delivery date."
4,workss,can say it best but it the best i tried so far help with acid re flux taking every day even every few day i didn't get any of regular problem will buy more very soon
3,"transpersonal experience accounts, not theories","The book describes transpersonal and paranormal experiences, with anecdotal evidence of their validity. It's not really about the scientific theory about them. For example, it only briefly refers to the holography analogy and the relevant studies in quantum physics, and doesn't really explain them in detail as the title might suggest; that was a bit disappointing. From a psychological side, same thing - it doesn't talk about the why and when and how of the phenomena, just that they occur.Still, a decent introduction to what's possible in non-ordinary consciousness, from a reputable scientist; it will make you open your mind a bit more to new age topics. If that's what you're looking for, then it's not a bad book."
2,"Great in theory, vague on actual studies and research","Though I do share similar beliefs in a lot of what Dr. Grof concludes, he leaves a lot more room for debate than need be. There are many metaphysical topics he touches upon that may seem a bit ""out there"" for many (i.e. past lives, living archetypes, out-of-body experiences, etc.) and yet he offers little to back-up what he says.The problem is that this particular book is more like an overview than a careful and thorough analysis of the mind. Dr. Grof only provides anecdotal evidence and cursory summations of research and studies to justify his conclusions. A lot of the material comes from his own experiences and that of his patients. This is not enough to sway me intellectually and not what I expected from a book that presents itself within a scientific context. If this were entitled ""Chicken Soup for the Holotropic Mind,"" I probably wouldn't feel as disappointed. Ah, well..."
5,This One Really Makes You Think,"This book was one of my first introductions into taking concepts from physics and proposing mind expanding concepts of how the universe works and as the title indicates, how these ideas can change human consciousness. I loved the book."
3,Some good things and some disappointing,"I approve the decision for a laptop maker that has many models to have one docking station support as many models as they can. The xb2000 does what's advertised, but there are areas for product improvement:* The docking cable is a big, thick heavy thing. A lot of torque is applied to the connector on the laptop when it is installed. Although it works now (new) they should come up with some sort of strain relief for this.* The docking station does not support high-res VGA, only S-video. So if you have an external monitor at your docking site you have to plug in two cables when you dock -- the VGA cable and the everything else cable.* The wireless keyboard and mouse are supported by an external wireless pod -- would have been better to be internal.* Would it kill them to include a power supply inside the unit instead of relying on a (separately purchased) brick power supply?Other than that -- it's ok."
1,Not water resistant.,"It works pretty good and it is quite exact, but... it is engraved on back of it, WATER RESISTANT 3 ATM, I got it for 5 min into the water no deeper than 50cm(children pool) and that was it. Thank you Erik Edelhausen."
4,Good watches,"Thanks for the watch. Description is fully consistent.Watches run accurately. It is not clear from the producing country. Not convenient to fasten the strap. Too much light, on closer examination it is seen substandard treatment details. Watches are protected from moisture? In general, satisfied with the purchase.Grigory, Moscow."
3,Its Ok --- but that's it for me,"Let me say that the service from the seller was great, and very prompt...but to be honest I can't be as enthusiastic as other reviewers. The packaging is beautiful --- but the watch is quite lightweight --- fine for some I guess - but I expected a more substantial piece. The case is clunky and not particularly aesthetic in design. But for the price? Well I guess what you pay for and for a couple of hundred bucks, I guess its OK... on the other hand I would have serious doubts as to the worth at the claimed RRP, sorry, and I certainly dont conssider it an ""heirloom watch"" Am I being harsh? I really dont think so"
5,Eye-catching Automatic,"The ""Dorado"" stands out and gets attention. Its design is breathtaking. Its quality and workmanship are unequaled in its class. Bravo!"
4,Too shiny,"I bought this over the internet. So I was not prepared for what was coming at me. Better to buy watches in a store, or at least see them with your own eyes. Too big, too shiny, too ambigiuos - both in the nature of the watch manufacturer, and the time. On the side note, I am afraid I might get robbed with this shiny thing on my hand. ( I live in Moscow) Considering all the minuses, it is an interesting prototype to have in your collection."
2,Waggin' the Dragon,"__________________Where have we heard about an additional planet, unknown to astronomers? In Sitchin of course. What about planets on cometary orbits? Baillie, Clube/Napier, Velikovsky, and other scholars, as well as Sitchin. What about periodic and predictable celestial chaos? LaViolette, Sitchin, Baillie, Clube/Napier...The author claims that a tenth planet whistles on past the other planets at 892 year intervals, meaning that the most recent pass was no longer ago than 1109 AD, and has happened at least twice since Julius Caesar was a boy. This book may be worth reading, but not at this price. Try the local library, and if not found, ask them to purchase it for the lending collection."
4,A lucid survey of cultural implications of belief systems,"Belloc is in fine form as he details both the cultural implications of, and the Catholic Church's response to, five of the major challenges to orthodox Christianity. Includes chapters on Arianism, Islam, and Protestantism. A good starting point when studying the development of Christian doctrine."
4,Interesting Reading,"I found this book to be very interesting and provocative reading. The author writing style does take some getting used to, but is well worth it. His almost prophetic review of Islam and it's current place in world affairs is especially thought provoking."
2,"Bad, Quick, Sloppy Review Based on Reading from Long Ago","I'm sure this book is good, but it was too dry for me. Belloc is a historian, so this reads as a history book, whatever that means."
1,This game is not worth a dime!,"Seriously people... this game is horrible. It's a series of 8 games that are very simplistic and BORING. Your typical flash game on the web is better. The graphics in-game are not that great. Even my 3 and 5 year old Incredibles Fans were bored after 5 minutes.""Daddy Turn it off this isn't fun!"" was all I heard. Man, I wasn't expecting much but this is about 2 days of programming effort, Not even a day of 'design' and some cut scenes. Sorely disappointed in this one. If I could return it, I would. AVOID!What you get: 8 basic 'single task games' such as:-Help Mr. Incredible get in shape by pressing the spacebar at the right time (boring)-Help Dash get to the front of the class and put tacks on the teacher's chair. (for one.. do I want my kids doing that? There would have been better things to show)-Help ""mom"" catch dishes as they fall. (oooo How EXCITING)It's too painful to go on. This is pure license abusing crud."
1,Best Avoided,"I have to agree with the other review, I bought it from another store cheaply as the case was damaged and was sorely dissapointed even for the price I paid.There are a limited number of very basic games that have been crudely fit into the Incredibles theme. Not much thought has gone into this product."
1,Not a good value,"This game is not worth 20 dollars. When I brought it home, I beat it in five minutes, both the medium and easy levels. The problem is that the hard level is too hard, so it would be frustrating for most people and the easy and medium levels are way too easy. I cannot recommend this game and I'm sorry about that because the game looks like a lot of fun and I spent my birthday money on it."
2,Very disappointing,"I received this game as a gift. My son received the Game Cube version at the same time. I played mine once, he is still playing his a month later. The graphics are so-so. The games themselves are boring. If you have a video game system I recommend that version instead of the pc. It is a totally different game. There are different levels and an ultimate goal. It keeps my 13 year old entertained. If I had had a choice I would have passed on the pc version."
1,"""wrong disc"" strikes again","Like so many others, I purchased this for my 6 year old son and when attempting to play it after installation I got the famed, ""Wrong disc"" error. Wished I'd researched it 1st before buying. Tech help is non-existant, no one answers. What a load of cr-p."
1,Waste of Time and Money!,"My 7 year old son bought this game with his birthday money and could hardly wait to play it. He's learned a great deal of patience since then. Install went fine but soon we were hit with the now infamous ""Wrong disc inserted."" message. Our home machine is a bit older so I thought I would try it at work. Being a software test engineer(for the past 10 year), I have access to quite a few machines and know about getting things to work.!!!THIS GAME WILL NOT RUN ON A SINGLE MACHINE I'VE TRIED IT ON!!!Forget about getting any help from THQ either. If you manage to actually get the phone system to answer, (Usually it just rings, and rings, and...) all you get is an automated message informing you they are currently upgrading their phone system, so leave a message or go online.Online won't help either though. The online support form must go to an internet blackhole. I have yet to hear anything back from them."
1,Do not buy the 1-CD version of this game,"I purchased this game from Best Buy for my son, but THQ (game maker) apparently neglected to check if the 1-CD version of the game would work on PC's. It doesn't. There apparently was a 2-CD version that did work.I installed the game on my son's computer - and got him all excited, only to have a very unhappy child when we went to play the game and the error message ""wrong disc inserted"" appeared instead of Dash or Violet. I am a computer expert and tried every trick I know to get this to work, to no avail.This apparently has happened to others (a quick google search will reveal this), and the support at THQ seems to be famously bad. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
2,Kaz,"Well it looks really cool, but doesn't work really well, I open it all the way up and barely smell it."
1,Doesn't fit,I purchased this for my husband. Unfortunately it did not fit his streamlight scorpion flashlight. We had to return it...which was no problem...but very disappointed.
4,Delightful Point of View,"This mystery was related from a unique point of view...as a Scot gamekeeper's journal being transcribed by his neice (a pregnant gunsmith married to a policeman)....nothing to jarring, but a delightful interweaving of enjoyable characters in a rural community. The editorial notes by the neice enhanced her uncle's account of the events, giving a delightful twist to his perspective. This was the first time I had run across a Gerald Hammond mystery and I was pleased to discover there are several of these treasures out there for me to explore. I will be acquiring more for summer reading."
1,The worst company I ever bought product from,"The worst company I ever bought product from, I ordered merchandise on nov. 19 and it is dec.21 and I have not received item. If something takes over 1 month to be sent I would have never bought from these guys."
2,"Flimsy, thin gold.","I returned this. I was quite disappointed in the feel... it was like a feather, not like gold at all. However, I regret my decision since my final price was 157-dollars U.S., and it now is going for 490! My wife has slapped me viciously about the head and shoulders ;-}"
4,School of Fish,"This book is concise and well organized. It is inspirational no matter what the age of your students.Heather Hanson, D.D.S.Dental Practice Management ConsultantFormer Junior School Teacher"
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book after a teacher at a conference shared how the Fish philosophy improved her work climate. I expected the book to be more like typical teaching books with concrete examples of how to implement strategies in the classroom. Instead it is more of a collection of inspirational stories from teachers who have followed the philosophy.I then went to the website listed in the book for curriculum ideas, only to find that I have to pay for them.Overall, it was an interesting and rejuvenating read, except for the constant plugs for their video, which of course can be bought separately on their website."
3,Unit Works But Install Software is Weak,"The unit does work. On Windows XP the install software will set up the print driver on the network, but often won't recognize that a USB printer is plugged in and subsequently refuses to let you load a printer driver to the device, e.g. Canon printers. You can get around this by trying to open the print server printer port directly from the Windows network. Windows will recognize that no printer driver is loaded on the print server and ask you if you want to load a driver. You may also have to create a Standard TCP/IP Port to use with your printer <> print server connection. Nothing about any of this in the documentation. Web site tech support for this unit does not exist. Email tech support turn around is usually within 24 hours. Don't buy this unit if you don't want to play around getting it installed. On the other hand, this unit can be found at some very low prices right now. Its a trade off."
2,prints garbage or blank pages,"I purchased this pint server for an onsite office that is totally wireless (wireless desktops - wasn't my decision for them to be wireless, but that's beside the point).In any case, installation wasn't difficult. However, the office has called me on two separate occasions to tell me their printer is now printing garbled code or blank pages. It might print a couple of good pages followed by bad pages. It's not a driver issue as they are using the same driver they used when their printer was hooked up to one of their desktops.I called tech support which has been outsourced to India by the way, and they were not of much help. Told me to reboot the computer and the print server.I'm going to call again and ask for level 2 support. It's possible that this print server is not compatible with their printer..not sure.I'm giving this 2 stars only because it was easy to set up. But that's it. Piece of garbage."
1,Not all printers supported,While one of my printers does work with this device the printer that I purchased this device for does NOT work with it. I sent a note to support asking for help but to-date have had no reply.
2,CONSIDER PEOPLE OVERSEAS - REMOTE AREA,"I lived in Australia, Singapore and Malaysia - but now I've to go back to Indonesia. Having set up a business in a rural area, it's so difficult to get ""ready made foodstuff"" like Mayonese, or other instant sauce. Transportation is bad, and I really creave for those food I used to eat overseas. I just hope Todd will try to explain more how to make those 'instant stuff' from scratch! How to make a nice mayonese, mustard, or other necessary sauce. Replacement flour, or butter. Eventhough I got this book, there are lotsa stuffs I can't cook unless I fly to get those ingredients! Please...please tell us more!"
4,"Sometimes Good, Sometimes Bad","Reading this book is like navigating a field of land mines: Where do you step? What recipes will turn out good? The Cheesecake Factory Pumpkin Cheesecake,which I ( budding gourmet cook ) cooked exactly as Todd directed, turned out with a burnt crust. ( Did the 5 minute blind baking do it? ) On the other hand, the No-Fire Peppers are terrific. I suggest adding grated Cheddar cheese to the filling for a nice twist."
5,Outstanding book.,"I have two of the Todd Wilbur books and have truly enjoyed both of them. In many cases the recipe isn't like the original food... it's better. A good example of this is the Lone Star Steak House Texas Rice. The ""real"" thing pales in comparison. Today we dined on Tony Roma's ribs (great sauce, by the way)"
5,The Best of the Top Secret Line,"I love this book and have served some of the stuff at parties (Hooter's Chicken Wings, Planet Hollywood Crunch Chicken, Outback Coconut Shrimp, and Cheesecake Factory Pumpkin Cheesecake so far.) The recipes are relatively simple, fun to make, and delicious. I highly recommend this book to all my friends."
5,Wonderful Recipes Especially the Cheesecake Factory Jambalya,I have only tried the Cheesecake Factory Jambalya but have read the other recipes. The jambalya tasted EXACTLY like that at the restaurant. I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. I have only read the others but they all look promising.
4,Top Secret Restaurant Recipes,"I have both this book and the Top Secret Restaurant Recipes 2. After using for several years, have passed them on to family members who like to cook."
4,A Man's Version of Martha Stewart : ),"The key lime cheesecake is a hit for giftgiving. Easy to make and tastes just like the real thing.Thesebooks are for people who are tired of the Martha Stewart type books and just want to have a good AMERICAN hearty meal... of course they're fattening, but what isn't now days! .. and your not eating hamburgers everyday, just as you don't eat from these recipes everyday.... although I did order the lite cookbook to try. (let you know in a few weeks)Kids young and old will like these some of these cooked meal on a FRIDAY night while watching a video from Blockbusters.Thanks for these reviews, they helped me! END"
4,A great cookbook to add to your collection,This is a fun cookbook. I have tried to copy things I have eaten from restuarants and never was able to copy it right. I love the the IHOP cheese blintz and couldnt for the life of me figure out what was in the middle. Now with this book I am able to make it myself. That recipe alone for me made the book worthwhile. I am going to try the bloomin onion next. It even tells you how to cut the onion. This is just a fun cookbook to have whether you are a professional chef or a dont know how to even boil water. The one negative about the book is the paper its printed on. It would never survive a spill. I tend to have more spills or splatters on my cookbooks because they are right in front of me as I am using them. This one I will have to be more careful with because it wont be able to take it.
5,YUMMY !,"I've craved the secret to Planet Hollywood's Cap'n Crunch Chicken for 10 years -- now I can make it myself! Todd's book is a true treat for all of us who love the famous items at restaurants and have the time to prepare them at home. If you enjoy luscious treats and sumptuous entrees, this cookbook is a MUST HAVE!Also makes a thoughtful and really FUN gift. I've bought a few for my friends, male and female alike, and they agreed it was the best cookbook they own. Enjoy!"
5,Got them on the Dot!,I've recently tried a lot of recipes off websites that claim they have the recipes. They didn't turn out that well. I bought this book a couple weeks ago and EVERYTHING I've made came out PERFECT. I totally recommend this book to those who love to eat restaurant-style. :)
5,Good tips,"This nifty book is more than worth its price! It's easy to get through, which is very valuable to me, but more importantly, the advice is sound. I haven't read all sixty tips yet, but most of the one's I have read are certainly applicable in a lot of the situations I face. Some of the tips I wouldn't try, but most are well within my comfort zone. Quite a few of the tips I've never encountered before, and that makes this book special!"
5,Great CD!,"Buy this CD and play it anytime you're stuck, your odds of gettingunstuck will improve. The tips here are arranged from the quite simple tothe rather involved, but most of them are within the typical person'scapabilities, I think. About three out of four of them applied to me, andthe ones that don't are still interesting to listen to. I haven't seen thebook of the same title, but I imagine it's quite similar to the audioprogram."
2,Nothing to write home about ...,"It was difficult to stay ""tuned-in"" to this book. A few good ideas, but nothing new or different. It is not a book that I would recommend, however, I might try to listen again -- just to see if I missed the point. I certainly would NOT give this book as a gift."
2,I played drums,I played the drums on three tracks of this LP for the Hayriders in about 1986 and never got a penny from the record company!
2,Strangely written book,"The events in this book are hard to follow sometimes, especially when Moira (the cashier who eventually becomes involved in the scheme) is talking. Unlike ""Tongue in Cheek"", this book jumps from topic to topic and doesn't seem to be a cohesive narrative of what's going on. Normally, you don't look for that in a Black Lace novel, but believe me, when it's not there you notice!"
5,tabitha flyte making waves...,"This is the third book I've read by this author, and it was every bit as good as the others. What I loved about this story was the heroine, a typical Tabitha Flyte heroine - strong and sassy, but vulnerable enough to feel real. Oh and the sex was great - saucy and salacious and plenty of it. Tabitha Flyte writes with such verve and wit that it is impossible not be carried along on this wave of intrigue and lust."
3,Not so Hot,"Tongue in Cheek was much better. This book is very scattered, and the ""action"" lacks focus and heat. Not terrible, but not up to her standards."
4,"sun, sea, sand and....","I loved Tabitha Flyte's Hottest Place so I really looked forward to this one. It didn't disappoint. The style was different - usually she writes in the 1st person point of view, but seeing things from different points of view made it all the more interesting. I liked seeing things from the male mind as well as the female mind and she seems to know exactly what turns people on, male or female, straight or gay. Nice one."
4,"Not the comedy book I thought it would be, however...","Not the comedy book I thought it would be, however it is an extremely well-written and insightful look into why these films were produced and the drive behind them. It also has a brief synopsis of almost every ""Mental Hygiene"" film written. Not a quick or a light read, but definitely an interesting book!"
5,Awesome!,This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Not only does to accurately describe and discuss these films but it does it with a touch of humor and gusto.
3,Developed a Hair-line crack,"This may not happen to all of these pie shells, or even to most. But, it happened to mine. It developed a hairline crack from one end of the plate to the other, right through the center. It's never been dropped or mishandled. It just developed at one end one day and spread to the other end. The crack is through the thickness of the plate, being visible from the top and the bottom. It hasn't actually fallen apart, yet, but I'm sure it will one day since it leaks oil from the pie shell as it's baking. This is likely a risk with any pie plate made from ceramic and not a specific fault of this one. However, it is something you should be aware of."
1,Disappointed,"This DVD is essentially the very same as ""Train Crazy Kids"". Which my grandson adores! Wish we had known this before we purchased it."
4,Annoying but very appealing to my son,"The introductory song might kill you, but the joy it brings your child is worth the many, many ""SERIOUSLY?"" moments. It is very informative... now if only they would do something from this decade.... =) By the way this video is from 1993."
1,Not age appropriate,"After reading reviews, I purchased this DVD for my three and a half year old. It is not worth the money. My son loves trains and was so bored with this video. I even tried to sit and watch with him to explain things, but he was not interested. Do not waste your money."
4,.to know - or not to know. that IS the question!,"A Bright Red Scream was a very imformative book. However, being a self - mutilator myself and have done extensive research on it ... this book didn't have anything that I did not know already. But, this book I think would be FANTASTIC for any mental health professional, or for anyone who knows someone who self-injures and wants to learn more about the background, why, who etcetc..."
3,"It's Great, But . . .","Marilee Strong has written a brilliant, compassionate book filled with heartbreaking testimony from many people who ""SI"" (short for self-injure), and she seasons this first person material with a lot of medical research into a particularly modern condition that has baffled many, even those who do it and their friends and parents. Even if you are not directly implicated in the topic, this book is so well written it might serve as the locus classicus for thinking on the subject, at least in the terms of the pop culture we live in.I do have one caveat however.Was Princess Diana really a cutter? The evidence for thinking so is flimsy at best, and Ms. Strong probably knows this, and still she decides oh, well, she's dead and won't be complaining if I brand her a cutter in my book, it will sell a few more copies (all the promo material features Diana's name prominently). I wonder who else Marilee Strong will ""out"" as a cutter as soon as they pop off in the future."
1,Too much...,"Ok so I only read the first few pages of this book and I felt sick, I almost ran to the bathroom because I felt so nauseous. Although I did not read the entire book, I could not relate to the first story at all. It was way too vivid and extreme as far as him hurting himself. I did not like it nor did I want to read further. I would not recommended this book for anybody under the age of 18"
5,"an incredible, but difficult read","Having just finished the book Cutting before reading this one, I have to say that A Bright Red Scream was very thorough, which at times made it very difficult to read. I fully appreciate the honesty of this book, as it really looks into the lives of those who self-injure, and refuses to see the behaviour as merely a pathological phenomenon. This book validates the experiences of the people she interviewed, which is in turn validating to those who SI in general. My only advice in regards to this book is that if you currently self-injure, or are a former self-injurer is to take this book a little at a time, since it can at times be incredibly triggering."
4,Good,I rated this only good instead of excellent because of the author's side tracked aside into some bizarre performance artists who inflict pain on themselves for others to pay to watch. This adds nothing to the subject at hand. The rest of the book is well written and informative. It is frankly difficult to read some of this because of the emotional pain of the people involved. A suggested read for anyone working with those who may harm themselves.
4,Written with compassion and respect,"Being one of the subjects that Marilee touch upon in this book I was absolutly terrified when I had been told that it was in the book stores. I was not sure if we would be conveyed as freaks of nature. Once I read it I was relieved to see that she was not on a mission to exploit the real pain that we are experiencing from day to day. She really come off as someone who had went out of her way to break the preconceived notions that society has been all too happy to hold us to. I didn't agree with all of her personal take on things but I still finished with a tremendous satisfaction that someone had finally taken the time to go deeper in to a subject that society is often more willing to ignore and pass of as a way to get attention.Marilee, THANK YOU for making me feel that I deserve some understanding. With exposure from talented authors like you this will not be a lost cause."
2,a misleading book,"Though this book is weel written and interesting it focuses too much on self-injurers who come from a backround of abuse. In truth only half of those who self injury have been abused, what about the other half? I self injure and I have never been abused. This book and the setement if perpetuates makes people like me feel as if we are self-piting and do not have a right to suffer from such a serious disorder. Though I understand that incest is more interesting than a parent's unhappy marriage or a mother's depression this book would have been much more informative if it spent a little more time on the later"
4,Thought-provoking,"I am IN the book, and I found the rest of it to be very thought-provoking. Didn't rehash the same tired theories I've read about. I even got my Mom to buy a copy."
5,unreleting action,"Nothing new here, just the point of view of the screen.Apart from that this game is pure contra, full of non-stop action from stage to stage.Cannot get enough of it.Some people complaint about the game being too short, but if you've played shattered soldier on ps2 you know thatthe first 4 stages are not the only ones in the game, you can get to stages 5,6, & 7 if you manage to finish the standard four with scores of A or above (which is not a piece of cake in any contra game).If you want to see the real ending of the game you have to exceed expectations of performance, just like in shattered soldier. Excellent!"
2,Every time they try to reinvent contra they mess it up big time.,Problems- way to easy- no jumping even though there is an unused button- The story is the worst video game story ever.- Just buy shattered solider(there is a reason why it came out first but still cost more)
5,You can't beat it for the money,I purchased this nailer to install solid hickory flooring. The nailer worked flawlesly. Not really sure what the $400-$500 dollar have over this one. Overall I am very satisfied.
2,Not everything that I would Have liked.,It took every bit of time allotted to get it. My son brought a Bostich home from work the first day I worked on a 12X22 room and I worked very well. It came and the first problem I had was changing out the cleat. I had to bend the cheap allen wrench the get the one that was on it off. It was difficult all the way like it had not been machined well. The mallet came with other instructions on how to tighten the head which got loose after a very short period of time. I had to crank up the air pressure to get it to set the staples well beyond the Bostich tool and still had problems with staples that did not fully seat. I have had to buy a nail set for staples to have if I am going to continue to use it. It did not jam but did not perform as well as was reviewed.
5,Superb,If you are in the market for a floor nailer look no further. I just bought this one and installed 1800sq ft of bamboo flooring. Excellent performance and I rate this tool as a must have!!!
4,No Problems,"I used the Akuzuki pneumatic nailer to staple a 120 square foot hallway with 3/4 inch maple boards. It worked as advertised. I did not need to make any adjustments or corrections to the equipment. I added oil as directed, plugged it into my compressor, practiced on some scrap boards to see how hard to swing the mallet and then got busy in the project. Next on the home improvements list is the master bedroom floor which is a much larger area, but based on the performance so far, I don't expect any issues. Well worth the money compared to renting - especially in my case when I could only spend an hour or two at a time working on the floor."
5,Akuzuki 2-in-1,"Great tool. I just laid 780 sqft of bamboo floor, about 2700 nails, zero (ZERO!) misfires. Needs lubrication about every 800 shots, that's it. As the project was delayed over several weeks (measure those baseboards twice, and get extra stair noses because you will mis-cut quite a few, I had to order twice), it saved me a bundle to buy instead of renting. It uses FLN cleats, look what others have bought when buying this to select the proper gauge."
4,"Good buy, solid nailer","I've now used this to lay approximately 450 feet of hardwood using only the cleat nails at this point. It took a while for me to get the nailer adjusted and feeding consistently, but once I had done so, and had used it for a few minutes, I found it very reliable and effective, and completely appropriate for a do-it-yourselfer like myself.The nailer seems to be good quality and produces good results. I would recommend it."
3,Floor nailer,"The floor nailer worked for two rooms unil it started to leak compressed air. I contacted the company and they sent a gasket. Quality controls could be better, and from reading other reviews, they is not an isolated problem."
4,Reliable but ....,I purchased this nailer only after the refurbished manual Bosch nailer that i purchased broke after only 20 square feet of hardwood installation. I have installed about 400 plus square feet with this Akuzuki tool without any functional issues. I am starting to experience some air leaks within the unit itself but it is not interfering with the functionality. I did receive the extra O rings but I don't want to stop the project to replace these.
5,Good investment!,"I purchased this tool to install my first hardwood floor. Since I am not a pro at installing hardwood floors -- and had no idea how long it would take, renting a similar tool from Home Depot for $130/week was not appealing. I was impressed with the ease of operation and have already installed 300 square feet of flooring and the tool has worked wonderful. I would recommend this nailer and am very pleased with my purchase."
4,works right out of the box,The floor nailer works great. However after a while there appears to be an air leak at the connector for the air hose. It is still working in spite of the leak.
5,Great Nailer!,"First timer with hardwood flooring and it couldn't have been easier. Putting down 3/4 inch solid maple was a snap. Almost effortless striking of the tool puts the nail in perfect every time. I only had one miss-hit out of 3000+ nails and it was probably my own fault. Removing 3 screws from the base with the supplied hex wrench, easily and quickly cleared the jam and I was back in business. Don't fret about laying your own floor with a tool like this!"
5,Excellent value for a Durable Tool,"I purchased this floor nailer based on the excellent price and the reviews found here. The nailer arrived quickly and included a nice case with accessories. I used it to install 1200 sq ft of 3/4"" hickory flooring. I used both Bostitch and Senco 2"" cleat nails with no problems. The nailer is a bit heavy, but probably average for similar tools. It has plenty of power to fully seat the nails. It feels solid and durable, and I'm happy with the purchase."
4,Great Nailer for the price,This is a great nailer for the price! I was almost sold on the reconditioned bostich because of the name but i went out on a limb and bought this and LOVE IT! Quality construction with extra parts included. Everything comes in an easy to store case and shipping was fast. I would recommend this product to anyone. The only thing to keep in mind is read the directions and dont over hit the head or it will crack the edge of prefinished flooring.
2,Wouldn't work with solid Bamboo,"Silly me. I though all nailers allowed both 16 and 18 gauge cleats. Users recommend 18 gauge for solid 5/8 inch bamboo (Trillium) but manufacturer states either can be used. I tried 16 gauge and worked the compressor right up to 125lbs and it still wouldn't drive the cleats all the way in. I then bought the Bostitch MIIIFN on the advise from a Home Depot rep who told me it takes either. After the reading manual, it only takes the one Bostitch size which is 16 gauge. I tried it with the 16 gauge cleats. Using the recommended 3/8"" NPT, it drove the cleat way into the boards at 90lbs. I adjusted and settled at 50 Lbs to drive the cleats to the proper depth, at or a hair below flush. The Bostitch worked flawlessly and is really really built well. I'm about to finsh the rest of the house in a 3/4"" hand scraped oak and I'm sure the Bostitch will work great. It now comes with a set of shoes to accomodate most flooring thicknesses. I sold the Akuzuki."
2,"Arrived damaged, won't shoot ""L"" cleats, Jam is annoying.","This nailer is good for the price but jams too often. It also arrived damaged and won't fit or shoot any ""L"" cleats. So far I have installed 600 sq/ft of hardwood with it but it is defected and will be returned, I purchased another Nailer from NuMax at cheaper price but so far it hasn't jammed once and it drives the stapler all the way through every single stroke. This Akuzuki looks the same, but does not work the same as the NuMax which is cheaper and better. I had to pull so many stapler out because a lot of times it would shoot it in only half way! Very time consuming if you ask me."
5,Just an awesome tool,"Started installing the floor last night with a friend. This machine is great, very smooth, and I'm very happy how it performs. My friend is also impressed, specially when it's more then half the cost of a bostitch."
4,Great tool for the price,"I've installed approx. 300 sq. feet so far with no issues. Didn't jam once. I had to tighten some bolts in the beginning and didn't leak from those areas again. It came with a few common replacement parts and pictures on how to replace which I haven't had to use yet but they explained the process very thoroughly. About 250 sq. ft. into the job I started hearing a faint leak coming out of the bottom. I couldn't get rid of it with tightening any of the bolts. One of the replacement parts may need to be used. It didn't hinder the operation on the tool though. Overall, I'm glad I didn't rent. I'll know if it was worth it when I finish up the other ~700 sq. ft."
4,worked great,"Bought this to install my new bamboo floor. We had about 900 square feet to lay down and this worked like a champ the whole time. I haven't done hundreds of floors, but if you are not a professional floor installer, this will definitely work for you and the price is well worth it!"
1,Akuzuki does not exist,"I purchased this flooring nailer on Feb 12, 2012. I did not start to use the nailer until March. I managed to get through one stick of Bostich L-cleats and it began to jam, and it jammed and it jammed and it jammed.I was past my 30 day return period so I reached out through Amazon to send an email to the manufacturer to take advantage of the 12 months warranty - no response!I then sent an email to the address in the handout included with the nailer - no response!I searched as best I could to find a real address for Akuzuki and could not find one in the U.S. or elsewhere. I did a whois search on their non-funtioning [...] and they are hiding their identity.DO NOT BUY THIS NAILER - PERIODI am willing to change my review if Akuzuki ever responds to my warranty claim."
4,Akuzuki 2-in-one nailer,It arrived on time and in perfect condition. I tested and tightened the screws on it as a precaution. It worked and works perfectly. The manual is OK but could be improved for clairity. I was surprized at its size - it is a horse but is industry standard. The last few rows need to be blind nailed as usual - not its fault as it is a very good tool.
5,Great Value,"I bought the Akuzuki floor nailer based on the good price, and good reviews that I read. Delivery was fast, and the kit came with everything I needed to start work. So far I have put down 450 square feet of 3/4 inch oak flooring, used almost 4000 nails, and have had no jams or problems."
5,Make Their Day!,"Super book!! If you follow the advice in Make Their Day! your employees will be more fulfilled, more productive, and confident. It outlines simple and efficient ways to recognize employees wihtout taking time out from busy schedules and without spending money. As a manager, I believe that recognition is the cornerstone of exemplary performance."
2,Disappointing,"I thought this book would be a comprehensive survey of fixed income securities. I guess I shouldn't put so much faith in book titles. The book was more like a study in archaic mathmatics.After the first few chapters of everyday overview, the author feels compelled to burst into nebulous formulas and esoteric notation in a hyperactive manner much to breathless to bother with explaining anything.Good for those who have doctoral degrees in math; bad for anyone else."
5,Terrific,"After seeing the guys in concert, I searched high and low to find a version of Me & Mrs Jones. I bought the CD just for that song and after listening to the CD, I now have a classic Hall & Oates collection. If you are a Hall & Oates fan, you gotta get this one."
3,"OK, but too much like every other B.T. documentary","Maybe I just want to believe in the Burmuda Triangle so much, that when I hear the people trying thier hardest to disprove it, it upsets me ?Maybe thats why I like Ancient Aliens so much? Just scientists showing the data and asking ""maybe this happened"" and "" how could people have done this thousands of years ago?"" nobody saying ""thats crazy!""As with most History Channel programs, it is presented in a classy fashion that shows allot of interesting scenes and scenarios, but would be much more interesting and ""fun"" without the negative input."
5,Love the clear explanations,"I was initially drawn to this book because a family member had had a stroke and I really appreciated having an explanation that I (and my mother) could understand. The illustrations really make the difference. Although I've only had the book a short while, I've turned to it several more times as other ailments have impacted friends and families. Although the title says it's for Women's Health issues, many of the items discussed impact men as well. The glossary and online resources for more information were really helpful - I would also have liked an index. The only thing I found missing was information on Parkinson's. But overall this is a terrific resource that I highly recommend."
5,This book is a must read!,This book does an excellent job of explaining the basics in women's health. It provides a core of knowledge from which to begin any discussion with a medical professional whether it be about treatment of a current condition or prevention of future problems. The text is very readable and the illustrations make the presentation complete. Every woman owes it to herself to read this book.
2,Homemade video.,"In spite of the slick sleeve design, this product appears to be a homemade video designed to provide children under age 10 with a very basic introduction to human anatomy. Should be free."
1,Why did I pay for this?,This is below elementary. Scientific vocabulary and terminology is limited. Dr. Ricks speaks with a very monotone and boring voice. Teaching is not this physician's strength. I believe that students in my Human Anatomy and Physiology course could put together a much more interesting and scientifically stimulating video. This should be free.
3,stewy,"Science becomes a good read, when the human element is featured.To this reader came scenes of voyagers with beating hearts, hoping they have not become lost or are about to arrive in dangerous territory"
3,Review of Longitude,"This is a good book if all you are looking for is a biography of John Richardson. I was hoping to find more detail of the construction of his time pieces. That was totally lacking. Even a photograph or two, or sketches would have added at least somewhat."
1,Could have been much better,"You just can't put some irrelevent illustrations and a hard back on an already excellent book and expect it to get better.I purchased this version for my daughter as a gift and was very disapoited to find that it didn't really illustarte any thing further than the orginal. In fact, if any thing, this book is worse, since it is hard to carry and read. Better save US$10 and buy the paper back. However The ""illustrations"", (photos and reproduction of old drawings), are all excellent, as far as printing quality is concerned and will do a wonderfull job of adorning your coffee table for the visitors."
1,Longitude...I Only Read It For Summer Reading,"This book by Dava Sobel is by the worst Summer Reading Book I have read since The Boxcar Series in 4th Grade. Although the two are totally different, they are also totally boring. The beginning of ""Longitude"" acted as a lullaby. Fortunately, I did learn about Harrison and Kendell and Makeslyne. The ending was the only good part because of the bitter battles with the Longitude Committee and personal enemies (not to mention it was the ENDING). I have only read one of Dava Sobel's pieces. I intend to keep it that way."
2,A well done book on a boring subject (to me),"You must know by now, the prize for determining longitude at sea prior to satalites, etc.A race between the sextant types (astronomy) and the creation of a clock that does not lose time at sea(now available at all malls).If your interest lies with navigation, as does mine, this isn't your book. If your interest lies in the historic quest for the perfect clock, even though the author doesn't really go into why and how this clock is such so superior to others (ie the engineering), then this book is for you."
4,Good reading,"The movie on A&E thoroughly engulfed me, so I had to buy the book. The movie stayed pretty true to the book. The book added more detailed information, but appeared to miss pieces of the tomfollery during the development of H1-H4. Excellent read, not too long. I wish Sobel included actual photos and diagrams of the chronometers, Harris, and the others. Its hard visualizing the timepices, and the players, even though he described them. Fortunately, the book had a bookmark that contained color photos/drawings of H1-H4."
4,Very interesting,"The First chapter of the book is boring; however, the book gets more interesting by each chapter. The book is will organized. What I liked about the book is how John Harrison was hard worker, and believed of his idea to the last second of his life. This story is so interesting that I have never got bored of reading it. As an international student I recommend it to all people."
2,"No real hero, no real villain, and no solid plot.","Although the author is trying to make us believe it, in this book there is no real hero, no real villain, and no solid plot. Story goes mostly linear, but with sudden unnecessary jerks forward and backward in time, sometimes revealing the plot, most of the time only confusing the issue.Struggle of one man with the scientific bureaucracy of his time slowly but surely becomes obsolete, even irrelevant, and in the end there is no ""catharsis"" either, and story finally deflates without the satisfying ""boom"" or the ""aha"" effect. One feels as if the puzzle is being put together, and when the work is done, one does not care for the picture that ends in front of him."
3,"Should have been titled ""Clockmaking""","The book is well written and enjoyable, and I learned some history I didn't know. Most of the book is focused on the development of chronometers that could keep time well enough at sea to calculate longitude. I had hoped for more discussion of the actual experiences of mariners. I suggest Umberto Eco's ""Island of the Day Before"" for a fictional story that addresses many of the topics in ""Longitude""."
2,The book I received was not as represented,"This book is a fantastic read, and the illustrated version is a treasure to have. I gave my copy away to a friend based on the representation that I was getting a replacement in ""like new"" condition. Unfortunately the book which was sent me came from a Virginia Public Library, complete with card pocket and Library stamps on the inside covers. Also the beautiful book jacket was missing. So now I have in my collection a book which looks like I stole it from a public library."
3,Boring,would have liked charts and graphs to provide a clearer understanding of the Longitude problem and show how actual longitudinal position was calculated and should have shown pictures or drawings of navagational instruments. The author assumed the reader was completely familiar with the subject matter. Use of such additional information to describe the problem would have made the book far more exciting and readable to a larger range of customers
2,What does she mean,"When I saw this book I was really excited, but my excitement waned with each page. This topic is very graphic in nature and guess what - no diagrams. No explanations concerning the methods just a statement that something could be done buy something or other but not really how it was done. You're left with incomplete pictures of any particular method or subject. Many times I just wanted to throw this book in the garbage out frustration. I can't say I really enjoyed the book.If the author would have actually tried to learn and do navigation on the water the book would been written differently and better I suspect"
3,"Nothing, but Harrison","I'd say this book is excellent, and carries many goals that is useful to learn it for our life such as the desire, struggle and the patience. However , there is some hard vocabulary and some difficult scenarios for international people to understand ."
5,excellent and well-written,"i thought the book was concise and well-written, and not too technical for the average reader. i fail to understand why many of the reviews criticized ms.sobel for having ""no diagrams or line drawings."" i guess they didn't read the illustrated longitude. the book is full of excellent photographs and drawings, with full explanations. the subject of longitude was difficult enough for John Harrison and Ms. Sobel, please don't make it any more difficult without doing your homework. the book was great, and important, too!!!"
4,For the Layman,"I listened, twice in fact. Now I want to read more. The book needs technical support, yes, for the scientist, but for me and the other no nothings it introduces a new historical perspective to navigation, seafaring. Highly recommended for the ignorant."
3,good book but needs pictures,it is a shame that an otherwise good book about a mechanical engineering feat completely lacks ANY figures. This is a huge oversight
4,Wonderfully written historical narrative: Very Entertaining,"Science, politics, intrique and fortune all describe a story that's also filled with human endeavor, success and failure. A narrative of the 1760's that tells of an invention, the ships chronometer, that began the greatest era of naval exploration man has known. Sobel and Andrewes weave a entertaining tale that brings the story of a larger than life genious, John Harrison, down to a personal, most engaging level. Their descriptions of the British aristocracy and lifestyle were very good. I enjoyed this book very much."
4,well researched and written,"The discussion of the various means being developed and the politics that were attached to each method was intriguing. The elitism of the scientists and the attitude they had towardthe""mechanicsal"" approach was very intriguing. It was a good , fairly easy read."
3,Not a science book,"If you are looking for the ""science"" behind the longitude problem and how it was solved, skip this book. If you're looking for the ""drama"" behind the longitude problem and how it was solved - then go ahead and buy this book.Because this is not a science book. The author hardly describes how our hero John Harrison solves the problem of the longitude. Most of the pages are spent describing what our hero had to suffer through - to convince others that his invention was indeed the best solution available.No graphs or pictures of the clock that our hero invented. No explanation of the inner workings of the fine inventions. Thats what made this book dissapointing for me... because I expected all that in the book."
3,The longitude and English study guide.,"I read this book in reading assignment at English as a second language class. First of all, we didn't know about auther and of course who John Harrison is. However, longitude problems and their history are very interesting topic for foreign students. And I recomend to read for study Engilsh and Greenwich meridian histry. You'll also get knowledge about Western marine histroy."
2,Lightweight,"I sought this book out after really enjoying ""Galileo's Daughter"" by the same author. This book reads like a very early sketch of what could have been an equally substantial and enjoyable book. However it's disappointingly hollow and sparse. A very lightweight read."
3,A book that shows the worth of a watch in the 1700s,"The book, Longitude, I thought was a good book for anyone who loves history. Even though the cover shows that the book is about John Harrison, the book also tells of many other clock makers of his time, and how they all competed to win the longitude prize.The book tells of many of the problems that clockmakers faced and how they solved them to make a good, reliable, seaworthy, and correct clock and the price of doing such a feat. I would recommend this book to children 12 and up, or to one who has an interest for history.the reason I gave it 3 stars was because it was a little dull to read."
2,"""That"" the Longitude Problem was solved, rather than ""how"".","A beautifully constructed and deeply unsatisfying book. It tells us that the problem was solved but barely hints at HOW the problem was solved- truely social history, without substantial reference to technology. If only she'd had a co-author who cared how the deed was done!"
3,NOT QUICK MOVING,"Now I know, and the tale was a slow process. Reads like a historical mystery. If you want to know this propblem was addressed over time, The tecnical inovations and genus needed, and the amazing accuracy of some of the early maritime clocks is all laid out."
4,Kindle version is not illustrated,"An amazing story, well told. As I owned the original hard cover, which I enjoyed so much, I decided to purchase this version as my first eBook.However, I had hoped that the Kindle version would include at least one picture (as in the ""Illustrated Longitude"") book. Sadly not a single image. Even the cover page is bare. The Illustrated version of the book is so much more enjoyable when you can actually see the amazing clocks and detail that Harrison designed and built. Still a great story but the images really help bring it to life and would have made eBook version 5 stars.The Illustrated hard cover version:The Illustrated Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time"
4,a gem,"I first heard about this book from an interview on 'Booknotes.' The story seemed intriguing.The book was no disappointment. The paperback addition of this title fits in the palm of one's hand much as one of the later chronometers must have. The story telling is fine-tuned -- filled with tiny jewels of information. The author gives us a concise, and entertaining account of the politics surrounding one man's life-long attempt to gain recognition for his outstanding accomplishments."
4,Appreciation to Dava Sobel's hard work,"I can say that it was so wonderful when you REALLY could broaden your knowledge in history, geography, astronomy, navigation, cartography, and clockmaking as well as learn about history of longitude (which I'd never considered the difficulty of the works our previous scientists, and clockmakers, of course, had to go through for more than two centuries) at the same time through one little 175-page book.Many might have argued that the Longitude wasn't beautifully written as it would be. However, it made me feel grateful to Dava Sobel for such laborious efforts she put into the book. Just read one paragraph and you'll realize how hard it must have been for her to look for the sources, research over and over, and finally, tried to form all the oldest and hardest-to-read books (you bet how those scientific combining historical books look like!) into one single cohesive and informative work."
3,Not quite enough depth or breadth for my taste.,"Longitude certainly isn't a bad story, just a somewhat constrained one. Within the scope of the book, the story is interesting and well researched. However, one should note that there is a bit more to the history of this solution for dependable navigation due to the problem of longitude than Dava Sobel adresses in this small history. This does not detract from the observation that Longitude is an entertaining and informative (and factually accurate) read nonetheless."
4,excellent review of navigational history,"An excellent reivew of navigational history and complex problem requiring a few centuries to achieve solution. Interesting few hours read, for one with interest in history, navigation, or astronomy"
5,Fascinating,"I have absolutely no interest in this subject matter, which is why it is such an accomplishment of Sobel's that I found it to be such a riveting read. First-rate."
2,"Interesting topic, sketchily told","The author found a forgotten story to tell which promised to be very engrossing. Unfortunatley, the amount of material unearthed was more conducive to a long magazine article than a book. Considering the amount of publicity this book received I was stunned at how meagre a read it actually was. I found the book very disappointing."
3,Popular History,"Keep in mind this is a work of popular history, NOT some kind of legal, scientific, or historic document. If you want to learn how to make your own copy of Harrison's clock--as some other reviewers seem to imagine themselves doing--you need more than this.On the other hand, if you're looking for an interesting read about an oft-overlooked problem which was, despite one reviewers ravings to the contrary, one of the reasons Great Britain was able to forge an empire upon which the sun never set. Read LONGITUDE for what it is.That said, there is a problem with non-fiction: it doesn't often provide a storybook ending, and that is the case here. Harrison doesn't come away with a happing ending and live happily ever after, but fades and decays with time. Still, a satisfying read."
5,"A great history of a subject so important, but obscure, that most of us have never heard of it.","Longitude measurement in the days of sailing ships could not be measured accurately. As the world became larger in the 18th century and distances longer, a way had to be found to determine where a ship was on its east-west passage. A number of methods were proposed but none were as accurate as measuring the distance from a fixed point, in this case Greenich Mean Time in England. An accurate time piece solved the problem."
4,easy read about a complex problem + a story of a genius,"What I liked about the book:- I didn't know the longitude problem was so serious and took so long to solve (today we have GPS and don't need to know a thing about navigation, right?)- story of a genius guy who solved it even if it took so long for the authorities to acknowledge it- interesting and effective method for government to look for some solution - offering a prize.- reads easily, not overflowing with technicalities but still enough to spark an interest. the author attaches all her sources so the reader longing for deeper knowledge can continue there.After reading this book I will certainly visit the Greenwhich observatory again and look at everything with better undestanding. I certainly look forward to it."
4,Best science history I've read this year,"Fast paced(I read this in one sitting), informative, written with a dry sense of humor that fits us perfectly in the space and time of it's story. For a topic so obscure to the modern mind, Sobel accomplished more then I would have thought possible. If this were a novel rather then nonfiction, it would be every bit as readable."
5,Lost 1st Copy,"I read Ms Sobel's work when it first came out several years ago and recently could not find it to reread. I remember how it affected me. I bored my friends to tears recounting the tragic situations the British navy were caught in before they had acquired Mr Harrison's chronometer. Explaining scientific information can be fraught with so many details and arcane data that the author can easily loose the reader. Ms Sobel somehow does not have this problem. Not only is she able to explain the vagaries of navigation but she does it so that the reader, throughout the book, is spellbound.Once I discovered my sole copy missing (I must have lent it out), I had to have another copy. I am looking forward to rereading it and know that anyone who purchases this work will certainly enjoy it."
3,"Overhyped, but Decent","Slim, vastly overhyped story of the quest to discover a method for calculating longitude, and the unassuming self-taught British clockmaker who invented what we now call the chronometer. It's somewhat interesting history in that it brings home what a big deal solving the longitude problem was, but the personal struggles and feuding come across as almost cliché-like. Still, worthwhile reading. An illustrated edition which is due to come out in late 1998 should be a bit more interesting."
1,Case Study Illustrating Dumbing Down of Modern Intellect,"Dava Sobel's ""Longitude : The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time"" is to scientific explanation, as Jane Pauly's ""Nightline"" is to an incisive portrayal of the news. If you think this is a compliment, read the book. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
1,This is not a review,I have not read it. I bought it as a gift for an individual who loves it. This is not a review
3,longitude,"the account of the development of a solution for determining longitude at sea by Dava Sobel was interesting and well told. Unfortunately I thought I had purchased a paperback volume in good condition. When it arrived I found it had been defaced and there were marks, comments and underlining throughout the book. I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known it was to have so much damage and defacement."
1,Loved the concept. Disappointed by the book.,"The concept is fascinating but the execution is poor. The science didn't carry the book, nor did the story. As a story, it was lacking in writing that conveyed dramatic tension of character development. On the other hand, it failed to compensate by really delving into the science behind the issue. I was very disappointed by what should have been a more compelling story from the perspective of technology and human interest."
2,Not the best longitude book,"I read ""The Quest for Longitude"" before I read this book. ""The Quest for Longitude"" is a MUCH better book about John Harrison and the work he did to develop an accurate clock which could be used shipboard. The Quest for Longitude has many more illustrations and goes into detail on the clocks as well as the people involved. It's a really good tale and deserves better than Sobel's efforts. If you're interested in the story of finding longitude shipboard, get ""The Quest for Longitude"" instead of this book."
1,Just a story without explanation of the mechanisms,"It's more of a book about history than science and engineering. The author never even explained how longitude is calculated using the chronometer. Do you need a sextant? What happens if you don't see the sun for a week? I am not satisfied with mere facts. I'd like to know how and why it is so. The book offers none.I really enjoyed Atul Gawande's books on medicine. He's a surgeon and epidemiologist who also writes very well. Simon Singh is another scientist (PhD in physics) and a great writer. He can make a lay reader feel they understand difficult mathematical problems such as the Fermat's last theorem. They write great books on science because they understand the scientific issues at hand.The other way round, a writer, who has no training in science or engineering, hardly understands the science, much less being able to offer explanation. Such is the case of this book, a book of anecdotes."
2,"Interesting story, disappointing book","There is no arguing that there is a fascinating story here -- I just hope someone will eventually write it. The writing in this book is clunky, and the book reads like an extended piece for a newsmagazine (which it may have been). The narrative thread is disjointed, and in several places I was left wanting more information.It is unfair to compare books to each other, but I read this book immediately following ""Fourth Part of the World..."" which is thematically related. ""Fourth Part of the World"" was a vastly better book."
2,A Story without Science,"This easy to read book contains very little information about what the technical problems were that Harrison actually solved. There is not even a single diagram in the entire text.Plenty of exagerated stories of the evil board of longitude, but no technology in a book about technology. Where an attempt is made the author gets it wrong, eg. confusing angles with distances, and stating that the temparature grid of brass and iron worked because the metals were of different lengths (and of course no diagram).It is like being given a fine looking cake with fabulous icing, but when the knife goes in the cake is hollow. The book will appeal to those that like the superficial.Anthony"
3,So disappointing!,"The author picked a fascinating topic, did tons of research, and set out to write a popular book. But she doesn't do justice to the human stories, and doesn't adequately explain the technology. So I couldn't really feel the frustration of the struggling inventor and couldn't appreciate his ingenuity. All I got was a clear sense of the importance of longitude - and the desire to read a better book about it."
4,Longitude,"I found this book to be a great read and quite informative. The topic is not something that I usually concern myself with, but when I came across the book awhile back, I figured that someday I should read it; that day came, and I'm quite glad I did. It's made me aware of a man I was heretofore not familiar with--John Harrison--and the significance of his inventions. What he accomplished was truly revolutionary, and his story deserves to be known; this highly readable account apptly serves that purpose."
4,Well-written story,"This is a great book to read, especially because it does a superb job of describing how difficult it was to navigate before Harrison's clocks. I imagine many people are not aware of just how hard it is to get across a giant ocean and not get lost while trying."
5,Held my interest from the start.,"The fascinating story of John Harrison's clock, and of hissuccesful, forty year quest for a means to establish longitude at sea, is contained in Dava Sobel's book, ""longitude""."
3,Interesting but quite biased,"A great topic to be sure, but the author deifies Hamilton, a clock maker who wins the final prize for determining longitude. No doubt about it: his clocks were great, but she is not fair in her comparison with other ways of determining longitude.The major competitor in the quest for longitude was Nevill Maskelyne and the method of lunars. I believe the author builds up the clock solution at the expense of lunars - they actually served as the main method of determining longitude from the late 1700s until about the mid 1800s in practice, as it took some time for clocks to become affordable.Someone needs to write a book about the method of lunars, whereby time (and thus longitude) is determined by using the moon as a clock through the use of a sextant. This solution actually has merit today since its chief problem then was lots of computation, something that a pocket calculator can do now in an instant."
2,Big dissapointment,I bought this book based on reviews I read here and heard on NPR. I expected this book to reveal the secrets lying behind the solution to one of the most challenging problems of mankind. Instead I learned about the political intrigues surrounding the making of the clocks. Being an engineer myself I found the book not fulfilling its promise of demystifying the intricate mechanism and technical difficulties of building the first watch.
4,Non-scientific explanation of time,A great read for people who are not scientists but love history (and are bound by time and want to know who to blame!) Some excellent photos. and diagrams.
3,Wonderful book - but where are the pictures?,"I'm a technology history junkie and this book looked just right. And this Kindle book is, with a comprehensive history of the dispute over either using a chronometer to establish longitude or using the moon position. Emphasis is on the chronometer and on John Harrison. But...the cover promises both an eight page color insert and a forward by Neil Armstrong, neither of which are included in the Kindle Edition. There's no excuse for this - I've written books for Kindle myself, and including images is easy. Often as I read I wished I could refer to a diagram or a photograph, but the only image in the entire book is the cover image. Too bad...if the images and forward had been included, I'd rate this much higher."
5,A little Gem!,"Beutiful writing, surprising history all done with brevity and accuracy. How sailors were able to find their way at sea, and what would happen when they didn't. How ego blocked recognition of the genius who did it. Here is a wonderful little book for your next 3-4 hour airplane travel. We can anticipate more fine writing by Dava Sobel."
4,Too long this longitude,"Although this book is small, the material still had to be stretched to get as far as it went. For anyone interested in a look at 17th and 18th politics, science and nefarious dealings, however, this book is for you. And it's a one day read. I would recommend this book for a high school or undergraduate level science project; the book does presuppose some knowledge of plane geography. You also get some interesting by-products of the quest for the way to determine longitude on the high seas."
4,"INFORMATIVE, WELL WRITTEN ENTERTAINMENT",This book is well worth the time it takes to read it. How many of us know how recent the accurate determination of Lonitude was and how it was solved. For the mariners this is a must book to fill in some areas of knowledge that we sometimes feel has been there forever. Not so.
4,Longitude,"This is an interesting account of a major scientific problem and its solution, which is almost all but forgotten today. If you enjoy the history of science, you will probably like this book."
4,The story of one man's battle for recognition,This is the story of a man that solved a problem of navigation for ships at sea by the invention of a reliable clock. The story covers the challenges faced and the politics of the day.
3,Informative but longwinded,"The story of tracking longitude and the development of an accurate time piece tells about a time of boats and paper maps. It if hard for some to imagine the world before GPS and iphone when the concept of longitude was difficult to determine. The novel, Longitude, gives the various attempts are creating a device or method to determine longitude while at sea.I think the story could have been told in a more engaging manner. There are many factors besides the English interest in longitude at sea that drove the search. On the other hand his story telling of history is extremely factual and full of details."
5,Beatiful Book,"Nice photographs and high quality paper. Ideal for display on a coffee table, or library/den. I've only read some of the book, but it looks very informative and useful. I'm glad I paid the extra few bucks for this book, compared to the cheaper paperback versions I've seen.This was recommended to me by a friend who is an avid reader, but I waited until now to buy it. The illustrations gave me a nice excuse to buy it now."
1,Irritatingly incomplete,I was deeply disappointed by this book. It was repetitive in style and didn't have much factual information.
2,"One sided, over-hyped chronical of chronometer developement","Easy read, but not too much depth. No real motivations presented regarding a man who spent his entire life in the pursuit of a single goal. Besides being written in an ""overly flowerly"" style at points, I thought the ""other side"" of the story was not well represented. Other points of view were hinted, but not explored or explained."
2,Journalese,"Dava Sobel has done extremely well from this book, as well she might as an experienced journalist with a flair for populist writing. Her chatty style is grating, her analysis is superficial and frankly I am unconvinced by her scholarship and ""study visit"" to Greenwich. Pseudo-science for the masses."
3,Long(in places)itude,"Easy read, but not much depth. No real motivations presented considering this man spent his entire life in the pursuit of a single goal. At times the writing reminded me of freshman composition 101, with long strings of descriptive adjectives. The author goes to some lengths to present other scholars in an adversarial role, but the ""other side"" was not well represented. Other points of view were hinted, but not explored or explained. Good as a history lesson, especially for those like me, eager to learn about anything having to do with sailing or the early days of world exploration."
2,I long(itud)ed for some technical info; left with a latitude,I really thought that I would have the opportunity to put some of the pieces of the discovery of longitude together. Sobel's discription of Harrison left me even more confused. No new history; no new technological discussion. Almost worthless.
3,"Interesting, but needs more history and science","Longitude told a very interesting tale about the longitude problem and how the world's greatest minds of the time were upstaged by a simple clockmaker. The narrative was interesting and kept my attention, but it seemed that ther were just too many gaps. I realize that details on Harrison's life are sketchy, but I'd like to understand how it could possibly take someone nearly 20 years to build a single clock, no matter how complicated. Though far from being a scienctist or engineer, I thought the book was also begging for at least some basic diagrams to help us understand just why Harrison's task was so daunting. It seems that this book either needs more detail, or one would be better off with the summary version presumably contained in an earlier article to which Sobel refers"
2,A museum guide view of the history of science,"This book has a very enticing title, and you can't help looking at the clock photos in the first pages.But there could be more substance in the text. Ideas are presented without a context - the powder of sympathy appears to be an isolated idea. Numbers and facts are treated like adjectives; for instance, don't try to calculate how many people died in the Centurion (chapter 2) and compare to the number of survivors.The book looks a lot like a museum visit, where each piece is explained, but no clear link is visible between the pieces. And then, the explanations are quite superficial, with little technical detail.Not that the longitude problem requires a technical text. On the contrary, it can be presented in dramatic colors as Umberto Eco did in his ""The Island of the day before""."
4,Quick concise history,"Great for those who read sea novels, historical non fiction of past adventures on the high seas, and those interested in such quirky yet significant discoveries that helped usher in ""progress"" to humankind's endeavors."
2,Not much information about the clocks themselves,"Although the description says ""Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem"", the book says pretty much nothing about how the clocks worked. Instead, we're treated to descriptions of the decorations on the clock, the color, the weight, and the number of parts in them. There's nothing about what advancements were made from H1 to H4. There's nothing about how the clocks were made.But if you like descriptions of the personalities involved, this book is for you. If you are interested in how the clocks worked, there's pretty much nothing here."
4,Entertaining book giving a good overview of the race to solve the Longitude problem,"This is a well written book that provides a very good story on the background and race to solve the ""Longitude Problem"". While some have commented that the book does not go into enough technical detail, I found that the book reached a very good balance of providing technical insight while not becoming a dry textbook. The human side of the story is interesting and well presented to easily keep the reader's interest, while the technical details are given in sufficient quantity to explain the problems at hand and the various approaches to solving them."
4,Interesting Science,"Accessible science. Interesting. Not for everyone, but I liked learning about longitude--what it actually is, why it is critically important for navigation, and how it came to be determined. Not something we think about much today. I never learned any of this in school."
3,Humorously Informing,"It gave good details on the characters involved, and it had humor to go along with it. This probably wouldn't catch many teenager's attention, but it did catch my attention because of the wittiness. If you want to learn more information on the history of Longitude this would be a good book to read!"
2,Mercifully brief......,"Occasionally a ""popular"" treatment of a serious subject will surprise a reader with its unexpected depth, its knowledge of the material, its ability to anticipate the pressing question, its facility in explaining the motives of the characters involved or the historical context. In addition, some even manage to be entertaining. David Duncan's Calendar comes to mind, for one.Unfortunately, Longitude seemed true to form as a ""popular"" book. John Harrison, the ""Lone Genius"" whose ""true story"" is being told, is flat and without motive. An moderately detailed discussion of navigational technique might have been extremely helpful in establishing the actual extent of the problem. All told, I came away with what I'd expect from a middling encyclopedia article. Thankfully, the book was short enough that I was done with it before I realized it was a waste of time."
1,Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time,"A mediocre book , the author clearly has no scientific knowlegde and drags the story out as if it was a Soap opera . No diagrams / drawings / patent descriptions are included , meagre technical information . NOT worth the effort of reading . this publication is an insult to the intelligence . ABSOLUTE RUBBISH . ( and I have read it ). William Asquith ."
3,Disappointing,"Many years ago, I visited the Royal Observatory Greenwich and was fascinated by the exhibits of John Harrison's clocks and their importance to navigation. ""Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time"" tells the remarkable story of the clock's inventor, John Harrison. While the story is itself fascinating, Dava Sobel is a poor writer and the book reads something like a high school textbook. Fortunately, the book is short and the facts of Harrison's life carry the day."
4,Broadens thinking to a reflection on the nature of discovery,"In addition to the fascinating account of Harrison's scientific achievement and his attempts to be justly recognized, I found this book to be remarkably thought-provoking on the very nature of scientific and technological progress. Non-scientists like me tend to think of goal-directed technological advance, financed by governments and private enterprises, and encouraged by prizes, as a relatively new phenomenon. The longitude story provides a strong continuity with the past, both in terms of scientific method and in terms of the difficult relationships between policy-makers, politicians (often ignorant of science and influenced by all manner of persons, competent or not) and scientists. This story has much to tell us about today's world as well."
4,Understanding Where We Are By Looking Back In History,"One of the amazing things about life in our world of technology is how the struggle for discovery and progrss was rather slow and frustrating just a few centuries ago. That said, reading Sobol's ""Longitude"" was a wonderful experience. Written briefly and for people who may not be scientists but certainly appreciate Science, the author gives us a sense of the human side of this ""longitude"" issue in its historical context. In the last few pages, when the she writes about finally coming face to face with ""these machines"" in their museum, one gets that little chill from the thought that a man (John Harrison), who died in 1776 and of whom most know little or nothing, left behind something that, in 1998, still exists and which, in its time, made a difference. Another small step for mankind, if you will, in solving the seemingly-endless array of challenges that confront us as we push forward."
4,a truely human look at the quest for longtitude,"Dava Sobel takes a compassionate look at man's quest for the knowledge of Longitude. The focus of the book is to describe this journey of discovery from a human perspective. At times some technical descriptions have been left out, particularly those concerning Harrisons 5 chronometers. Although frustrating at times, this lack of technincal material makes the book a light and easy read and brings the story of longitude to a wider audience, who otherwise would probably never know the true story of Harrisons struggle."
4,"This is a very good book for anyone who likes time, etc.","I enjoyed this book. It has a nice story to follow, but at the same time it has a sufficient amount of technical description to satisfy even an engineer (me). I would recommend reading it more than once because of the wealth of information contained in the text. After reading this book, you will definitely have a finer appreciation of the modern technology that allows us to locate ourselves anywhere in the world in a matter of seconds."
4,"Athoritative, amusing, and absorbing","I must say I ordered this book because of a review I read, not because I knew Dava Sobel's work or knew the least about clockmaking or sailing. Harrison's ingenuity, the times in which he lived, and the importance of his quest were more appealing to me, and I was not dissapointed. By all this I mean you need not be a sailor or anything to enjoy this fascinating and beautifully illustrated story. (A nice touch of sophistication for the coffee table as well, if you excuse the shallowness of such remark)"
4,Interesting and thrilling,This book is not only interesting but also thrilling ! When the author start to describe the next clock James Harisson is working on you can't wait to turn the page and see the real masterpiece in a picture. Then you can't put the book down until you get to the other famous clocks. It has been a great pleasure to read the story and look at the pictures.
2,So much potential...,"A readable but ultimately unsatisfying look at clockmaking and navigation. While the author explains the context well, it is unfortunately badly edited (describing one meeting twice in contradictory terms) and rather too basic (with charcters described in rather more detail than science). As an very basic introduction it is a good book - unfortunately it leaves many more questions unanswered than it should."
3,"A good primer on the chronometer and Harrison, but no depth.","After reading Longitude by Dava Sobel I now have a general understanding of the story behind the development of the chronometer. This book keeps on the topic, and is written in a strait forward manner, neither reflecting a technical nor academic style. Unfortunately, Sobel's style also lacks emotion, and I was left without feelings for the characters except outrage at the harsh treatment meted out to John Harrison, the chronometer's creator. The absence of pictures also made the chronometer itself, and its application, a bit difficult to visualize. I recommend this book to anyone wanting an introduction to this story, but for more depth, look elsewhere."
2,Horrid.,"I purchased this text as a companion to my growing collection of Patrick O'Brian books. I thought it would be nice to read up on the scientific advances that made sailing (a little) less random for the British Navy. I imagined an absorbing read with depth and clarity, like ""Fermat's Enigma."" Based on the reviews and O'Brian's statement (above) I think I wasn't setting my expectations too high.Instead, I found a book that was filled with flat characters, unsupportable sweeping statements, endless cliches, and generally a style so vapid that I couldn't even finish the book. I hope that someone revisits this subject sometime and writes a proper popular history that gives it the attention and treatment it deserves. I don't understand why O'Brian liked it as much as he did, and plan to forget his kind words about this book just as soon as I can."
2,Worth borrowing,"This prettily produced book is short and easy to read, not least because of the almost complete absence of that awkwardly indigestible subject of technology (which happens to be a requirement for designing watches). The ""human interest"" story is appalling and worth retelling, and Sobel retells it readably--I am not qualified to judge her accuracy. Borrow this from a friend, read it--it will probably take only three hours or so--and return it. Then, when in Greenwich, take a long look at the chronometers themselves, and buy one or two of the relevant offprints from scholarly/horological journals. These, available at the National Maritime Museum shop, tell you a lot about Harrison and very, very much more than this book does about his watches. And even though their covers aren't so pretty, they're well illustrated with photographs and lovingly rendered diagrams . . . and cost less."
4,Brief but enjoyable,"This slim volume tells the story of John Harrison who, although untrained, built four revolutionary clocks that changed how ships navigate at sea. It also tells about the political fight Harrison was forced to fight to win recognition for his work.Written in a easy-to-read, ""magazine"" tone the tale goes quickly, whole years pass in a couple sentences. I wanted more details and this is where the book disappoints but it may not be the authors fault The book hints that many events weren't recorded and more details just aren't available.One technical note: I think the font used in this tiny, five by eight inch book is a little small and the page numbers, even smaller, aren't readable at a glance. Or maybe I'm getting old."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Relax.Drift away.dream...ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!THIS CD sucks! Not only did it not make me relax, it made me angry because I wasted my money on this crap. It will be donated to charity."
3,Just okay,I have blessed this CD on as well. I did not find it conducive to sleeping nor was it appropriate for massage.
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"Though I have not been through this book in depth, I had a hard time finding something that was not too preach-y, and with interpretive and doctrinal spins of the author. I will have to spend quite a bit of time adjusting material for a more open view. The scripts give start points to do this, though. Those with similar interpretations and doctrines will likely not have issues with this material. I notice the high schoolers I work with dislike being characterized as teens, in which adults develop material to speak to them on their ground, but frequently miss it. This book seems to do just that in many places."
3,"OK, as far as it goes","This is a only a fair overview of the events of World Youth Day 1993, held in Denver Colorado. At 60 minutes it's just too short to be more than that - an overview. There is not nearly enough footage of Pope John Paul II and even less of his words except in very brief clips. Rather a disappointment as I was looking for something more in depth."
3,Fun read but very dated,The title of the review says it all. It's a fun read in short gulps - very short gulps! A good example of prose written back in a time when prose was very proper and somewhat tedious to read.
2,Not quite what I expected,"This bed doesn't provide much support, and at 24 x 12 x 15 inches, is a quite small for my 11.5 lb. cockerpoo who can't stretch out in it. Even curled up, she completely fills up this bed. I bought it in hopes that she would sleep in it instead of trying to sleep on my bed. She seems to prefer the floor or rocking chair to this bed which she only uses for only small part of the night. Considering returning it."
5,Good story if your seven year old boy is into hockey.,The book kept the interest of my son from start to finish. The book also provided accurate information on some of the skills used in hockey. My son is looking forward to the day he will be able to read it on his own.
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"I purchased these the other day. I received them on the 11th of Jan 2007I ordered some other ones before, 100ct box slim jims which were very good but unfortunately, they kept revising my order from Dec 19th until Jan 10th so, I canceled the order because it was taking way too long. I thought these would be just as good. ($15 dollars more than the 100ct box, But just as good & there's 180 of them, instead of 100). WRONG!These are really bad. They were all dried out & hard as rocks, and to top it off, They expire on the 24th of Feb. Less then a month from now. I've never had this problem with Amazon before. Usually their stuff is fresh. You will not be able to return them either. Once they are opened you are stuck with them. I contacted Amazon about this problem & they gave me a little of my money back. I will not be buying these in the future. Amazon must have had these for quite some time for them to be so bad."
1,Incredibles won't run on XP,"Software producers who release buggy software early, just to get it on the market before Christmas, should be boycotted. I have wasted a lot of time trying to get the Incredibles loaded on my daughter's XP system. (All her other new Christmas computer games work fine.) DOWN WITH THQ!!!!!!!!!"
2,Annoying,"This is another of those annoying games where you have to try over and over and over until you get it right. The book says you can save your progress at any point, but you can't. You restart at a checkpoint. If you exit the game and come back, you have to restart the level. The game crashed frequently in Win XP, but I switched compatibility to Win 98 and it's working better. Graphics are good, but the constantly changing viewpoint is really annoying. The Dash level was good, but now I'm stuck on Mr. Incredible trying to jump on a ledge. I make it maybe 1 in 20 tries, only to get killed afterwards trying to find where to go."
2,"Could be better, and it's buggy","The characters are a little difficult to control, so that could be better, but I can live with it. The real problem is that this game has been freezing up on me on my Windows XP system. Checking some of the tech support forums on the Web shows that some other people have been having the same problem, and that THQ is investigating."
1,Horrible gameplay...Don't Buy this!,This could have been a fun game except there was no logic to the savepoints. AND... I got about 90% through the game and couldn't complete one of the ending game sequences because it was impossible. Other posts said they had to try 100's of times to get through the ending level. What a disappointment. Booooo.....
4,He was a wonderful singer who died much too young,"I was a fan of Jesse Belvin and had his albums inthe late 50s, and early 60s. I thought he was great. He got killed in an automobile accident in december of 1960. I still miss his music, especially songs like ""What's New"" and Gerswins, ""Summertime""."
2,Good overview but lacking anything new or revealing,"Although this book may serve to guide people through South Asia, it doesn't really explain or go into the complexities of the region. In the case of Pakistan we do not get a complete picture of its varied past as western Pakistan isn't South Asia, but is instead more Middle Eastern as it is populated by speakers of Iranian languages (as opposed to the Indic tongues spoken in eastern Pakistan) Pashtuns and Baluchis. Also the Hindu-Muslim struggles are reduced to religion rather than adding the linguistic and cultural divisions prevalent to this day. For being tauted as revisionist there seems to be little revisionism just different wording."
1,Disappointing,"The book does not provide nearly enough information to truly understand the complexities of the situations. It presents a somewhat biased view, as one author is Pakistani and the other is a member of Subhas Chandra Bose's family (and so naturally has less than glowing praise for the Congress leadership at the time of independence). The book is often repetitive, making the same points in multiple chapters. It attempts to sound more intellectual than it really is, through the use of complicated vocabulary, while presenting a rather simplistic history of the region. Overall, a disappointing book."
3,Disappointing,"This book will disappoint anybody with a decent knowledge of the history of India. While this book provides is a good general review of the events in the subcontinent over the last 300 years, it is not rigorous in its treatment of various events that have occured.However, the authors have admirably condensed 300 years of history in a small text and thus the book merits three stars."
2,Innacurate,"Their portrayal of Wycliffe was inaccurate and biased. John Wycliffe is someone very worth studying and learning as much as possible about, however, this film will not help you in that pursuit. In addition to not staying entirely true to all the facts, they make a biased assumption to say that his success was due his scholarship and made no consideration to the Holy Spirit or God's divine intervention.I would look elsewhere for a film about the reformers or John Wycliffe."
3,Disappointing,"The acting and production are clearly lower quality than what we are used to. The story is still good, however."
4,Historically Accurate,I showed this video to my senior English class as we studied about John Wycliffe. It kept their interest and made the material from the text book come to life for them.
4,Movie about Persecuted Bible Translator,"This historically factual DVD is most enlightening. Without people like the subject of this movie, we would not have the privilege of reading the Bible in English"
4,Compulsory bookshelf material.,Buy this book! Sumptuously illustrated with some really mouthwatering recipes - try the Strawberry Granita for instance. Very good all round.
5,Excellent Guide to the Arabian Peninsula,"Lonley Planet almost always publishes excellent travel guides and this book is no exception. I used it in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and Oman and found it of the usually excellent standard of the Lonley Plant series."
3,Nothing on Mecca and Medina,"This is a good guide, to the places it covers, as many have written before. However, unlike Lonely Planet's Saudi Arabia (2004 edition, out of print, second edition not planned) it totally ignores Saudi's two holiest cities. Yes, they are inaccessible to non-Muslims, though many have tried and got away with it. However Lonely Planet decided that no Muslims buy their guides and that non-Muslims traveling to Saudi are not even interested in reading about these cities, so important to the country. This is probably, a political correctness issue, they don't want to ""encourage"" non-Muslims to try to visit the cities, but it really should be clearly stated on the coverage map on the guide."
1,This was very disapointing,"When I first saw the trailer for that movie I was quite exited. I thought that the subject was very interesting and I was really looking forward to see it. What a disappointment, when I first saw it I thought of asking for a refund. What a waste of public fund (it was funded by the nfb). But the trailer was so promising ! Don't waste your money on that."
4,tulku,service of sending the video was good and in a timely manner; the movie was okay; just wished women were included. it is a controversy about this subject and the background on how some tulkus are found. not for a person who is a beginner in the Dharma to watch.
5,Journal makes a fantastic book club gift,"Every year our book club has a holiday gift exchange. I have now given this journal to three fellow members. Each one has said how useful it is. I finally bought one for myself this year. After years of keeping just lists of the books I read, this journal invites me to add notes, details and suggestions from others for future reading. Highly recommended!"
2,I don't have this much to say about books I read!,"I returned this one and kept a smaller, simpler, more portable book journal. I just don't have paragraphs to say about things I read -- I'm making notes to my future self and keeping track of what I read and what I want to read. This journal is for people who really want to spend time and space reflecting on what they've read."
3,Still worth the purchase,This journal is very useful to take notes as you read. The only problem I found is that the wishlist section is too short. I also could have done without the large book loan section. I don't loan out books unless I don't care if I get them back.
5,Gift,so sorry I can't give a review. I'm sure it was fine for my 13 year old granddaughter as it was on her Christmas list.
5,The Best Hair CD EVER!!,"This has got to be the best recording of HAIR EVER!!! The ensemble singing is spectacular, the solo songs are great the the orchestrations are fantastic. John Barrowman does a fantastic job a Claude. His rendition of ""Where Do I Go?"" had got to be the best version of that song I've ever heard. Now, eventhough this CD gets 5 stars, I do have two complaints... the guy who plays Berger cannot sing very well (in my opinion) and where is ""Don't Put It Down?"" That is a great song. I am greatful for the inclusion of ""All You Have To Do,"" and ""Dead End."" Both are really great songs. Basically, if you own the other three Hair CD's, (which I do), then you have to get this version. It's definately better than the HORRIBLE Original London Cast CD. The singing on that one is awful. And, it's got a better sound reproduction than the OBCR. All you have to do is give up all desire and BUY THIS CD!!!"
3,Great card game scene,"The first part of the book is fascinatingly similar to Casino Royale. Both books centre around a card game. Unfortunately, the rest of the book is incredibly tedious as there is not enough going on.This is the only Bond novel where the film is an improvement over the book. Still, it does have the master`s touch."
4,A step back,"THE LAST BOOK WAS much better ,I think... better villain. This book is a little slow but during the third act picks up very well. Can't say I wasn't entertained because I read it in three days. Can't wait to see how the movie ruins the good story..."
3,Not bad at all.,"This book however still not being able to surpass it's two predesessors, it is still an OK read. The reason why this book does not live up to Casino Royale, and Live and Let Die, is the card scene in the beginning. It is completely, and uterly boring. This goes on for six chapters, then things really start to get going One of the most creative villians, turns out to be... not what I expected. I had an entire other thing that I thought was going on. But, all in all it is far better than the movie, which just shares the title, and the name of the villian. Moonraker, in this book is not even a spacecraft, and Bond never steps foot of off planet Earth, it works far better that way."
5,Best Of The Old James Bond's,"Of all the old James Bonds, Moonraker is the best. I've seen the movie over 20 times and everytime I watch it, it's better. So you should all buy this book."
4,Bittersweet,James seems so much more human reading the books than he does in the movies. I have much more feelings for him as a man as I continue to read each novel.
3,Moderately good read,"All my comments about the Bond books will be the same so if this reads familiar, you have read it on another of them. I read these years ago when the movies started, when Craig did Casino Royale I decided to re-read it, (Casino Royale) again, I then decided to re-read all the early ones, which I think are superior reads, but that is just me (obviously).I feel this is the weakest of the early books. Still, it's a good, lightweight read, don't misunderstand me though it is enjoyable but the others I prefer!!"
4,Better in every way than the film.,"This gritty, fast paced, gripping tale of Bond and a cool, intelligent undercover policewoman in a race to save London from the machinations of a cadre of fanatical Nazi commandos who never quite gave up on the Third Reich is a far cry from the farcical Bond movie that Roger Moore made in the twilight of his career as James Bond. Even if you did not like the movie, you will like the book if you are a Bond fan. Even though you will be unable to see anyone else as the villainous Sir Hugo Drax. But, just imagining Christopher Walken as a fanatical Nazi partisan will only add to your enjoyment of this great book. Which, if you are a Kindle user, you can get for free from the Kindle owners lending library, along with all of the other Ian Fleming Bond books."
3,Best Of The First Three,"Well I was ready to hate Moonraker because of the movie. So if you hated the movie...try the book. It isn't campy with the Space Shuttle at all. It has a rocket as the object, but it really isn't about that. The beginning part of the book is about cards. I loved it. However it starts getting bogged down in the middle section and then like all Ian Fleming books it wraps up really quick. I just felt the ending was just too contrived. I liked it because I was prepared to hate it, but it's still not that great. It's the best of the first three but that's not saying much. I would recommend it just for the beginning section because it shows how James Bond thinks and rationalizes things. Plus he doesn't get the girl at all in this book."
2,"The pace is very slow, not much action...","Moonraker has a good premise, a very human and quirky main villian who has an interesting background, but the pace of the book is really slow. James Bond doesn't even fire his gun the entire book. I don't expect Bond to shoot someone every page, but he doesn't even engage in combat. There is very little hand-to-hand combat, a couple car chases, and no gunfire. If there is only a little action, I expect deep and thoughtful espionage to substitute, but the book doesn't give you that either. There are some interesting chapters here-and-there, I like the card playing scenes, and the story Drax tells bond at the end, but the book is kind of non-eventful as a whole. I have read several of Ian Fleming's Bond books, this one is at the bottom of the list."
5,007's adventures continue in the utterly awesome Moonraker.,"Of the first four novels that Ian Fleming wrote, Moonraker is, without a doubt, the best. This third Bond adventure revolves around the plot of Hugo Drax to decimate England with a nuclear missile, the Moonraker. Suspense is present on page after page, even when Bond and M are just sitting at a bridge table with Drax. Gala Brand is another atypical Bond girl, and their relationship certainly doesn't take the course one might expect. Moonraker is one of my very favorites, and one of the five best novels of the Bond series."
2,Not my Cup of Tea,"Out of 63 photo's of Cudas, the Author only gives 14 shots to Challengers. If you need a reference to Challengers there are better books out there."
5,Great tool box for the money,"This tool box has a lot of room available for it's size. The top two compartments are very spacious and can hold quite a few tools. The bottom has decent amount of storage for larger items. The side trays are good for sockets and wrenches.This box has a good feel about it, not like a cheap bargain tool box but something you can plan on using everyday."
5,Cantilever Toobox,"Great Toolbox!! I use it as a knife kit to bring my knives back and forth from work. Has held up well, and looks to have many years to come. Although I may outgrow it before it wears out."
4,Welcome Back Shonen Knife,"This is not Shonen Knife's best album, but it is the best since Michie left the group. Genki Shock has a low tech feel thanks toa lack of sythesizers and to me a more guitar oriented sound that harkens back to Shonen Knife's best two albums (Happy Hour and Brand New Knife).What Genki Shock lacks (as with all albums after Michie's departute) is the band's soul. Noako still proves to be a clever songwriter, guitarist and singer. Atsuko is adequate on bass and backing vocals. Atsuko is one of my favorite drummers (listen to her command and timing and find anyone more skilled) and is far better in that role than the previous two.The new Knife album is good, solid and a welcome addition to my collection."
2,Unclear Title,"My college Spanish professor asked us to buy a Vox Spanish Dictionary (not a Spanish/English dictionary). I was expecting a university level Spanish dictionary, but this is a child's product, with pictures and everything. A good product but needs to be more clearly explained to the consumer."
5,This is the real Morrissey.,"In a fairer world, Bill Morrissey would surely be a lot more famous than the sulky, former Smiths frontman.Why doesn't Bill Morrissey sell millions of cd's? He is certainly up there with the best singer-songwriters. If Townes van Zandt was the best poet in songwriting, Bill Morrissey is, in my book, the best short story songwriter.Come Running is a welcome return to form. Maybe his finest effort since Inside?If you want the real thing when it comes to singer-songwriters, look no further. Bill Morrissey is the real Morrissey."
2,Not Bill's Best,"Like the strangely de-saturated image of Bill on the cover, this album is something of a pale shadow of the man's oeuvre. It's as though he's run out of story vignettes. The irritatingly banal Summer Jumped All Over Me is a case in point, lacking Bill's usual finesse and wordplay. Make no mistake, Bill Morrissey is a true gem. I hold his albums in very high regard. Few can hold a candle to his ability to make lyrics sit seamlessly with melody. Just listen to Birches on the album Night Train or These Cold Fingers from Standing Eight. This album, however, is padded out with pedestrian blues. It's worth a listen, and essential buying if you're a fan, but try his earlier albums (not the previous Something I Saw or Thought I Saw, where he is starting to run out of ideas) to hear Bill at his best."
2,Not quite ready yet,"The documentation,setup and networking was simple and ""straight forward"" and worked ok incuding the WEP configuration but the firmware had to be upgraded to 1.35 in order for the device to recognize the USB laser printer attached(samsung ml-1702). The Device reboots slowly and none at all when the printers are attached. I find that if I make any changes to the device before rebooting it, I need to remove all printers then reboot and after it comes back on attach them. for this reason i give it a low rating as in the case of a power cut you would have to reset it this way, which would remove it from working seamlessly in an environment, unless it was attached to a UPS. If this is corrected then it maybe worth the high cost. Good attempt but at a high cost to consumers. Not for the inexperienced."
1,Do not buy this product! Try this one instead: Apple's Airport Extreme,"I gave the HWPS12UG hours and hours (actually days) of my time over the past year trying to make it work. I called their tech support several times. It seems they have just one guy working there because I always got him and he was always condescending though he couldn't figure out how to make the thing work. They exchanged the old one, sent me a new one and still couldn't make it work. My father figured out how to install it by playing with IP addresses etc. but when I tried to add a new printer, it threw everything off again.I finally switched to Apple's AirportExtreme and had my windows computers and iMac's printing to an old Ethernet printer and a new USB printer in seconds using Apple's free bonjour software. I can't believe I wasted so much of my time being frustrated with this Hawkings product that simply is not ready for primetime!"
2,Gossip Girl 9 Only In Your Dreams,"I am an avid reader of the von Ziegesar's series ""Gossip Girl""; however, ""Only In Your Dreams"" did not follow along with the other enjoyable, light-hearted, and juicy books. I found this to be the most boring enstallment in the series. The sole reason for reading this book would to be prepared for a possible Gossip Girl 10 - hopefully filled with the scandal and GOSSIP we love and miss."
4,"Yea, Okay.","I think book 9 is where somebody else took over. A chapter into it I put it down because it sounded forced, like they're trying to get the whole point across that it's Gossip Girl! I'll still finish it though and continue the series."
1,It's about time,"This series is WAAAAAAY TOO LOOOOONG. It used to be good, but now, it's starting to get BOR-ING! It has to end soon or else I'll sleep!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"Okay, I really did try to read one of these books once, but that didn't last very long. I honestly don't understand why people even like them. There's nothing good about these books. They're just about materialistic people and their boring, superficial lives. Seems to be that all they do is drink, have sex, and backstab their ""friends"". How wonderful. Don't waste your money."
1,Porn for teens,"Parents, this is not innocent romantic fantasy. It contains explicit descriptions of sexual activity between high school kids. I have found references to Debbie Does Dallas, etc. These books are now off-limits for my 16-year-old."
3,Not as good as the others,"I agree with what some of the other people are saying this book is no where near as good as the other books, it seems as if ever since the kids graduated the author has run out of ideas. And those reviewers who are complaining about how this book isn't apporiate for younger readers, shoud know this book is for ages 16 and up and every 16 year old has heard or used the ""f"" word at least once in their lives. Yes there is a lot of sex, drugs, and bad language but that's a part of the real world."
3,The Black Stallion,I watched this movie and had a hard time getting into it. I never thought anyone was going to talk in it. The first half hour is boring but then it picks up. It turned out to be OK. I would not recommend this movie unless you were a big fan of The Black Stallion books as a child.
4,High Quality Sound,"The sound on this DVD is encoded in 24 bit 96KHz sampling. According to the sampling theorem, this would enable frequencies upto 48KHz to be recorded. A person with perfect hearing could hear upto 18KHz. So why record inaudible frequencies? The idea is that this helps to reproduce transients faithfully. The musicianship on the DVD is good but bland. The sound, at first hearing, is like that on a well recorded CD. The percussion does sound more open and natural. On the whole, I feel this type of music does not glaringly show off the capabilities of the medium. Thus the four stars."
5,Great fit and quality...,"I bought this custom sun shield for my girlfriend's '99 Ford Taurus and it fits very well and looks very sturdy and reeks of quality. Much more than I expected, honestly. Sun shields are a must in Florida. I think once my factory-made shield gets old enough, I'll order one for myself. Much better than the cheap and flimsy alternatives. A lot of people don't want to pay 30 bucks for a sun shield, but it's totally worth it. Nice product!"
5,For the Adventurous,"I bought this CD on a whim, never before hearing Michael Marcus, and I'm astounded. The sounds they were getting were like nothing I've ever heard. If you want to hear a pair of geniuses explore new ideas, then this is for you."
3,Impractical projects,"The projects in this book are not anything I would ever attempt. But, I thoroughly enjoyed the complete directions and seeing how each of them were made and how they worked."
3,wachy ideas for wood working.,I thought this book would have sopme different patterns eo work with but it doesnt .It basic intrurtion for wood workinf.
2,Application to Projects is Unclear,"This book does collect a lot of thoughts on quality management in general. I am familiar with quality concepts, but I was expecting from the title to find better application of these concepts to a project. Dr. Ireland seems to drift between referring to the project and referring to the product. That, coupled with some unnecessarily complex language, makes this book difficult to understand. It is phrased as though it is a general discussion of projects of all types, but I found that many areas did not apply to the types of projects that I work on - development of a product for subsequent mass production. I suspect that Dr. Ireland leans towards ""build-to-order"" projects, such as construction or custom IT projects. Practitioners in these areas may find his book more helpful than I did."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you want to read about how to squeeze the worldly view of creation into the Bible, this is the book for you. Darwin would be very proud of this book. Jim, like most people, completely ignores the scientific facts that disprove evolution.If you want to read about the Biblical account of creation, and the science that the news media ignores, get ""The Lie: Evolution"" by Ken Ham."
1,UNWATCHABLE!!!,"The movies featured are fantastic,yes, but the actual quality of picture and sound is the worst I have EVER seen.It almost seems like someone filmed a tv screen playing a really bad vhs tape. How bad? Let me count the ways...If you love silent movies like me, do yourself a big favor, perish the thought of buying this set and spend a bit extra to get the titles individually. KINO VIDEO, IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT or CRITERION COLLECTION are terrific at restoration of vintage treasures such as these."
4,From My Point Of View...,This book is truly fascinating as it opens the doors to the world about Hindu astrology. It is also based in a place where not many people visit as tourists which makes the reader to know more about the place itself. I loved this book and would like to recoment to anyone who would like a decent novel.
3,Bus America: Revelations of a Redneck,"Have you lost your prejudice of fat people, like Fluffy yet? Good book anyways, cried laughing."
5,"Charming, funny and ALMOST believable!","This was a wonderful ""get away"" romance filled with possibilities and fun. It had an ending that was predictable, but nonetheless good for the soul. I enjoyed the characters and the banter between them. It was a great read for anyone looking for a ""no brainer"" romance."
3,For the grad student in all of us...,"Well, at least you can't accuse Dando of not growing along with his fans. If you rocked - kind of, sort of - to the Lemonheads when you were in your early twenties, now you can mellow out in your early thirties with Baby I'm Bored. None of these songs are particularly memorable but they capture the tone of pre-midlife-crisis angst perfectly: not so much depressed as resigned. Sure, life isn't as exciting as it was when you were back in the dorms but you know, uh, it's the only game around. Anyway, perfect for that moving-out-of-the-loft party you've got next weekend in Williamsburg."
2,Baby it's Boring,"Alas, I never heard the Lemonheads and perhaps they were something I would of liked. But after hearing former frontman Evan Dandos' solo project I somehow don't think so.It's not that there is anything horribly bad in this record, but thats it's problem, there isn't much of anything in this record. The songs sort of plod along in an unchangeing dirgelike rhythm (you could tap your foot to this entire record at more or less the same speed). The music is unremarkable unadorned chord strumming and the lyrics are quasi-wistful innocuous sad sack garbage that I seriously couldn't remember a line of five minutes after the record ended. In fact, I couldn't hum a bar from one of these songs right now and I listened to it this morning.In short, unless you suffer from a severe case of insomnia, pass this record over for something else."
1,Not the Evan Dando I know!,"Words can't describe how awful this album is. I tried to give it a chance, but it ended up flying out the window of my car due to my anger with paying 15 bucks for it. This is NOT THE EVAN DANDO I KNOW. Poor melodies and no cohesiveness. Pray the band gets back together..."
2,So am I,"If this album is what happens when you clean up your act and kick your drug habit, we should all hope Evan Dando falls off the wagon soon.2 words: major disappointment. I mean, pick any Lemonheads album and it's great from start to finish. This thing is awful. What happened to the catchy melodies?Next time, rather than pay $$$ for a CD, we should just send the cash straight to Dando so he can buy some ...... and write some decent songs."
3,Not that small.,"This is a quality bag but not ""small"" Check out dimiensiosn before you buy. A lot larger than what I was looking for."
5,A great selection for beginners,"For those wishing to learn more about Tango, this selection has both the scratchy originals of the incomparable Carlos Gardel, as well as classic remakes of the essential pieces. Make no mistake, these are authentic Tango, and very enjoyable!"
3,"Not much details, outdated","I don't think this is the best book on Koi. Although it covers all the standard topics (Koi identification, pond building, filtration system, diseasees, etc.), it does not give enough details in each topic. The ""Tretra Encyclopedia Book of Koi"" is by far the best . I know, it is not available for sale any more, but try to find it in a library. It is well worth the effort and you can save money as well."
3,a good koi book,a good koi book with high price. and it is already outdated however a good book for you collection.
5,Great for motorcycles,"I've been using the PL14610 filter with my 2000 Triumph Speed Triple 955i. As far as I can tell, it's been working great. The PL14612 is also usable in a pinch. The difference is that the PL14612 is an inch shorter than the PL14610. Keep that mind if you have clearance issues."
1,grip overspray,"I ordered two of these filters for my 06 cbr600rr. I was alarmed to see a few loose flecks of the gold grip spray stuff Purolator uses inside of the rubber gasket seal. The flecks were about the size of a grain of sand, and my concern is they'll end up taking a few trips around my motor and transmission. I'm not sure how much grip texture trash is inside the filter or if it is on the outlet side of the filter.I personally have never had a problem removing non-textured filters from my other vehicles, so I see this grip texture as more trouble than it is worth. The texture feels softer than the texture Fram uses, so maybe that is why a few bits of grip were able to come off. I think it is unacceptable for a new filter to have loose trash flying around. I'll contact Amazon to see what the return process is like."
4,Very good low cost filter,"the filter material is MUCH thicker than the regular purolator and filters as well as higher costing brands.The grippy outer coating is excellent and really aids in putting the filter on and taking it off.In general this is as good of a filter as you could buy although there are better for a higher price but only worth it depending on the price. As this is normally cheaper than most it's always a great buy if your not too sure.But only 4 stars? Yes, the oil that came out of the pan seemed slightly dirtier than a more expensive filter that I know has better filter material. Not a huge deal but if you are a car fanatic that has to have the best this is not it."
3,Beware of contamination,"I recommend that it's a good idea to clean the mating surface and the internal metal face of the filter prior to installation. The two I purchased had tiny pieces of cardboard/paper dust, and also paint overspray on the inside portion of filter near the gasket, toward the holes. The overspray is the yellow textured paint, most of which I easily wiped off, while some I dislodged with a fingernail. A little more attention to quality would be nice, although otherwise it's a good filter."
5,fast shipping for a quick oil change,I did the math and it was smarter for me to do an oil change than bring it in to the stealership for a syn oil change. Buying this oil filter met the specs for my subaru wrx and it was easier to buy it from amazon than go to my local auto parts store. Fit was right on and I'll buy again!
1,puralator Pureone oil filter,"I ordered 4 of these filters. Amazon sent me a lesser filter (puralator classic). Had to return them and place another order for the correct ones(I hope they send the correct ones).The Pureones were on back order ( about a month). I do not know if the switch was intentional, but in any case this purchase was indeed a pain and has lessened my confidence in Amazon."
4,"Great filter, just check it for leaks","So far I've installed three of these PureONE filters, all purchased here on Amazon, and all on my 2005 Legacy GT. The first worked flawlessly for 5000 miles. The second had a noticeable but very slow leak for some reason. A very small amount of oil would ooze out of the side of the filter even when properly tightened. I've since replaced it with a third filter and so far there are no problems after 500 miles. The problem with the second filter is the only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars."
5,Excellent quality,"Based on my search through the internet on efficiency of filtering, this item does a better than usual job of keeping the oil pure. The back feed valve is an added great feature to keep oil in the filter at all times.The rough exterior grip coating makes it easy to install with one hand without the use of any filter tool. Even with lubrication of the seal before installation, I still have to use a filter removal tool to uninstall this filter, but it never sticks terribly tight like many other brands I've used. I change my oil around 9K miles using 5w-20, and this usually causes the filter to be quite stuck using other filters.I'd recommend this item."
2,You get what you paid for,This is very cheap indeed. That's good. But you don't get much out of it. Tha's not so good. I'll rather go for a real verbs book.That's my opinion.
5,Hot Hot Hot,After starting this book I didn't know whether to put on a pair of racing gloves or find a pair of oven mitts. Unfortunately I chose the racing gloves and had to spend several hours in the local ER for severe burns to my hands. This book is a great and fast paced read. Wished it was longer.
4,Looks great,"I like this fan a lot, especially because it's so energy efficient. The only think that I'm not crazy about is that it comes with a balancing kit for the blades; however, I didn't need to use it. Other than that, it was easy to install, and gives off a tremendous amound of air circulation."
3,"Good singer, sub-par compilation","I always thought that the best George Fox song (and video) by far was ""I Know Where You Go."" It's not on this collection, though, or his ""Greatest Hits"" album either (Check out his worthwhile CD ""Spice of Life"" if you want to hear it). I always thought Mr. Fox was reasonably talented, but he has certainly faded into obscurity, so I'm not sure there is actually such a thing as an ""Essential"" George Fox collection. I wasn't too thrilled with the song selection for this CD (thus only three stars) but that doesn't mean I think you shouldn't give George Fox a listen. Just check out his studio albums instead."
3,Piano - Cuban style,"I think this is worth a purchase. It didn't please me as much as Havana Remembered did. It is perhaps more pure cuban sound, and it is largely piano composition. Not bad, but not my favorite. Marcie Farley"
3,HERE'S THE TUNES from all music . com,here's the tunes1 Homage to Chano Pozo 8:522 Alfredo's Mood 6:123 Longina 4:314 Song for Yemaya 10:285 Brasiliangada 4:266 Three for One 6:377 Los Tres Golpes 4:238 Killer Tumbao Duran 2:369 Timba Mabó 10:26
2,cheap and it really was Cheap,"I got what I paid for it, but you should spend more and get something that won't be so disappointing. This is cheap, both in price and quality."
1,Interface is unreliable...,QPS' interface is unreliably bult. They have poor quality checks and the electronic tolerances are barely within the specs.
4,Perfectly fine...works great...Buy it if the price is good,"What can you say? It's a PCI firewire adaptor. It installseffortlessly (no driver disk required) in Win2k / WinXP.It works effortlessly, too.This is a rebadged SIIG firewire card that uses the VIA chipset,which is well-liked, and generally very compatible, chipset.It also comes with Ulead video editing software.If the price is good,go for it...David"
1,You get what you pay for,"If you want a firewire card that will stop working after a couple of months, this should be your first choice! Otherwise, reach a little deeper into your wallet and get a real card from a real brand."
4,Cheap Working Solution,This worked flawlessly on a XPSP2 box running a Via Chipset. Easy Solution with no problems.
3,"Decent speakers, look good","One of two boxes had a broken speaker. The two that I hooked up sound decent as long as the Bass is kept to a minimum. Good midrage - highrange sound. For the money, great speaker. But, definitely not a preferred speaker if money wasn't a limitation during purchase."
5,speakers,Used on camper under canopy. Fabricated canted body to mount speakers and they sound good with no problems. Recommend for this or other wet locations.
3,be careful,"first, speakers sound pretty good for being small and cheap...however... beware.Although listed as a 5.25 inch speaker, they actually require larger wholes than other brands. My situation was a replacement for worn speakers where a larger 6.5inch would not fit so I had to order new 5.25 inch as a direct replacement. I've now spent several hours enlarging the existing wholes in my boat to accomodate these speakers which was EXACTLY what i was trying to avoid....PITA!We will see how they last."
3,Ordinary sound at a WallyWorld price,You get what you pay for. These speakers deliver the sound. I had hoped for more . . .
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers are absolutely nothing like the old version. Well, apart from the bit with Vigilante in it early on.New versions of Klarion the Witch Boy, and the Shining Knight, and quite a lot of the supernatural alien type of influence."
3,Pretentious and baffling,"Need to give a facelift to some obscure comic book characters? Grant Morrison is your man for the job. Think of this more like an accounting exercise, of DC Comics rejuggling the numbers to make the sheets balance. Reading through volume four, I'm left as puzzled to the nature of the story when I started. Mysteries upon mysteries, maybe I'm too dumb to follow the origin stories and back stories, alternate universe stories of 7+ unknown characters. Reading through volume four left me feeling empty and lighter in the wallet, that's all.About the only thing that stood out was Mister Miracle's pointless beating and maiming, like he got on the wrong side of the New York City Plowmen's Association. If these are the New Gods of Apocalypse, let the characters rest with Jack Kirby and leave them alone. They deserve better, and so does the reader. (Review gets an extra star because I must be too dense to follow the knots of intricate supposed near-genius wordsmithery of Mr. Morrison.)"
5,Easy shopping,"Soft netting, very comfortable. Other than that, the quality wasn't there. The rope was frayed upon arrival. Factory 2nd ??? I had to seal the ends to keep them from unraveling. Price a little cheaper than stores."
2,Very dissappointed,"I ordered this for my hammock stand, installed easily, but when I laid down it streched and I ended up flat on the ground. There has got to be a better way to match a hammock to a hammock stand."
1,Not happy with hammock,"this hammock is made of a nylon cord called duracord....it is flimsy and stretches....I prefer the cotton rope hammock, which is a true Pawley Island Hammock.....the ""good old fashioned"" kind...the original...thank you for asking."
4,"Good, but not as good as it used to be.","I am sure this will hold up for years and years just like my first one did. My original was made on Pawley's Island, SC. This one is made in Greeneville, NC. I had hoped it would be the same. It isn't. It is a few inches longer. That would be fine if it were your first hammock from them. If, on the other hand, you had built your deck so your hammock would fit between the posts, it is a bummer. Again, if it is your first, you just make your posts further apart, or find a suitable pair of trees. Honestly, if I had bought 3 when I bought the first one, they may have all been different lengths.Also, the wooden bows are no longer bows. They are straight pieces of wood. Still oak, but no longer bowed.The quality is still good. It is just isn't as perfect a product as it once was.I would still recommend it.Shipping was quick. No problems there."
5,Perfect!,"Exact match for the one I got over 20 years ago. I fell asleep on it the first time on it and my back felt better than it has in a while, that's an added benefit. You will want a pillow as ropes are a bit hard on the back of your head. Shorts and t-shirt are fine but some may like a bit of padding like a beach towel."
4,Hammock Purchase,"Purchased this Hammock and it works perfectly. I would highly recommend this product and seller. No issues, very high quality product, as expected. Would rate a five, but reserve those for ungodly excellence, which is basically unattainable so you should understand."
3,"OK, but sloppy","I agree with another poster. This looks like it was knitted by a 3-year-old. Nice material, but, frayed knots EVERYWHERE. For this price, I definitely expect a competent weave job. I'm keeping it because it is comfortable (cotton-like) and looks otherwise pretty nice. To me, it is overpriced for the shoddy craftsmanship on the weave."
2,too much stretch!,"This product looked good and was designed to fit my hammock stand. However, it has not stopped stretching! I have pulled it tight to the point that I am not using any of the chain but have it hook to hook and it is still too saggy. The previous one from another company lasted 15 years....I'm already feeling like replacing this one. By the way, I weigh 185."
4,Very comfortable and stable!,"This is our second Pawleys Island hammock. It is VERY comfortable and feels more stable than our old one (maybe because it is wider). Plenty of room for my wife and I, and we can squeeze the kids in too if needed. Only reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is I prefered the more curved stretcher bars on the old Pawleys Island hammocks. Duracord is soft and comfortable and hopefully less likely to be eaten by mice in our shed like the previous cotton one. Great buy!"
5,Wonderful Hammock,The hammock was even nicer than I thought it would be. Easy to hang with the hardware included. Holds 2 adults comfortably... up to 450lbs
3,Lasted 2 years,"Just thought I would give some feedback on the lifespan of the duracord hammock. We live on the Gulf Coast where outdoor furniture is subjected to high heat and humidity, severe sunshine and some salt spray. I purchased this hammock in April 2010 and left it out year-round. Recently (July 2012) two ropes fell apart, several others look frayed and it's clear that it is not safe to use any more. While this sounds like a negative review, I was quite happy with the hammock for 2 years - it was comfortable, attractive, and put up with use by multiple kids. Just don't expect it to last forever."
5,LOVE IT! She could probably hold a 1000 pound person without breaking.,"We just got this product today in the mail and we love it. We originally got a hammock for my mother on Mother's Day a long time ago but, it was sold separately and didn't fit together. My dad didn't tell me that he ordered it so it could be a surprise. But it came and we were playing with it all day long until the sun went down. If you are a worried mother and you are afraid if you have a party at your house and people are on it, you could keep a little eye on them but just enjoy yourself because that thing isn't even a ton but it can hold about that. I only know this stuff (even though I just got it for a day) because I was outside for a while using it. I would recommend it!"
5,Pawleys Island Original Collection Large DuraCord Rope Hammock,"The hammock fit our old Pawleys Island stand and is comfortable and fun in our backyard.Pawleys Island Original Collection Large DuraCord Rope Hammock, Oatmeal"
5,Great and comfortable,"Easy out of the box assembly. I was nervous about Duracord, but it's just like cotton. Nice and comfy with lots of room. Don't forget a Hammock Pillow with your purchase. You definately need one. This was the best deal I could find with a reputable company name and product."
2,Comfortable but did not last,"I received a Pawley's Island hammock as a gift in July, 2009 (birthday). It was the new DuraCord version. It was comfortable but the rope deteriorated and broke by August of 2010, just one month past the one year warranty, and was not in a place where it could be retied. My previous hammocks made from the traditional cotton rope have lasted 4-6 years on average. I think they have some work to do on the duraCord product!"
4,good...,good. it is good quality. hurts that despues of which I made it bring outside of... enter shoping and demas.. aca.. but good... cheap pense me salia but that nonllegaria and it buys via Internet... but removing that detail is very good product...
2,Thok under the microscope,Uggh. That is all I can say about this toy. The desighn is EXACTLY like Avak to the last nanojhule. The face of Thok looks like somthing you might find in a section for say some kind of alein uglyness contest. It looks like a cube decked up with decals and an ovel slaped of for the mouth. The tool next. It looks WAY to much like a Takanuva blade on one side and on the other it looks like a laser from star wars. I am disapointed at lego. This toy is the WORST EVER.
1,Incomplete guide,Don't be fooled by the title to think that this book is a complete guide to the birds of Texas. It has the majority of common birds but some of the most common (like mourning doves) are relegated to a small corner on a page. The information given is nice but the incompleteness makes it frustrating to use as a real field guide.
3,national geographic field guide to birds: texas,"Left a lot of state birds out, and had those that were there in a strange order."
5,Excellent resource,"This book was just what I was looking for. It has great pictures, description of the female and territory map. It has been no end of value and has helped me identify all the birds that have come into my yard so far."
1,Wobbly and spins around,"Yuck. I purchased this to just hold the piles of UNO cards. This dopey thing spins all around when you pick up card, and the same when you discard. I'm going to try and remove the spinner on the bottom, because it is nuisance with it."
2,Fell apart,"We gave one or these to our neighbors who we play cards with a lot. After a few uses, the revolving mechanism fell apart and the ball bearings fell out. Kind of embarrassing. I had tried to find one without the revolving mechanism but could not find what I wanted so I settled on this one. Big mistake."
4,Great value,Our senior center uses these holders daily. The price is right and they hold up well. Biggest problem - people keep taking them home with them!!
3,for mature Catholics only,I decided to read Catholic Warrior because I found it in a solid Catholic bookstore that I trust. Upon reading it I began to feel somewhat uneasy. There were times when it seemed like I was reading Rick Warren or Joel Osteen. The author uses Evangelical jargon and is quick to criticize ordinary pew sitting Catholics. I couldn't find anything glaringly theologically amiss though. Just be careful. I'd say this is only for mature Catholics who have a real grasp on the basics of our Faith.
5,Excellent book on spiritual warfare!,"I have read this book several times because each time I do, I feel stronger in faith, more encouraged and inspired to continue being a faithful Catholic, frequenting the sacraments regularly. The author teaches us that we are not at the mercy of evil influences in this world. The Jesus we read about in the Bible is here with us now and commissions all of us to work those same miracles, to pray the way the apostles did, to experience the supernatural power of God's grace in our lives. This book always brings me back to this fact and in so doing, it makes Adoration, the Mass, Confession, all so much more meaningful and powerful for me as a Catholic. I highly recommend this book, even though I, too, was at first a little wary of some of the more evangelical style of writing about this topic but the content is solidly Catholic and well worth reading. It will enliven your faith and make you want to LIVE it!"
4,Important Topic,"Author Abel dares to venture into perhaps the most important - yet challenging - topic of today. We have averted our eyes from the world of spiritual warfare, which has only allowed the situation to worsen. Is spiritual warfare real? Yes, and we see the effects of ignoring this aspect of life in the culture crumbling around us. The challenge in this genre is finding those who actually know something about the subject. Abel is an informed and a decent guide, someone worth reading until those more informed write about the topic."
4,No Woman No Cry,very good reading and interesting story through the eyes of the one person closest to Mr. Marley
5,great book!,"if you like marley, u will love this book.know one knew bob marley like rita, and this is a very intersting book."
4,"A must for nature-lovers, and especially for birdwatchers","Sister Barbara Ann is, apparently, a meticulously trained naturalist as well as a professional artist and an unusually articulate writer. I have shared this book with many others, and each person has wanted to own a copy. It is a little polished gem."
1,NOT WHITE,"""Dont order this hat if you think you are getting white because you're NOT!!! I needed this hat to complete a Halloween costume for my son and when I recieved it, it was clearly ivory or off-white. When I contacted the seller and explained the situation he replied ""Well, there are many different kinds of white."" WHAT? Biggest waste of money I ever spent."""
5,NO SUPRISE,"It's no surprise that this DVD is good, because Ailey is always good. Ailey is better than good, damn near perfect."
2,Great show.,"I ordered the Alvin Ailey DVDs for overseas visitors who had enjoyed the performance in 2005, missed the December 2006 tour."
3,"Interesting ideas, but largely anecdotal","This book has some different ways of looking at food, but I was not convinced that the sugar/oil was what was working. For example, he repeatedly mentions his trip to Paris and not having an appetite after drinking local sodas. Um, it could also be that he was so busy sightseeing that he forgot or was simply not interested in eating. So, travel or get a hobby. In other words, find something else to occupy your mind.He also goes to great lengths to mention how many calories to eat of sugar and/or oil, and how long to take to do this during the day. You could also choose to ingest the same amount of calories of fruit, or oatmeal, for instance, and linger over those as well, getting the same appetite-suppressing effect.So, borrow the book from the library, and get some useful ideas from it, but not necessarily that particular diet."
2,What was I thinking?,I can't believe I got suckered into buying this book. There is barely enough info to warrant it being published as other than a small paperback--and it did not work. The only way to lose weight is eat less and exercise more.
1,"Junk Science, may work, still junk science","it's a junk science.authors reasoning is utterly stupid! taste-calorie association?!!i returned the book after reading 2 chapters. this may work for some people, but i couldn't take author's quackery."
1,Just another failed diet idea,"Is it possible that there's secret diet where people are losing tons of weight and it's not the news of the decade if not century?? Um. No. Because this diet isn't a diet. It's another scam. Drink sugar water, lose weight. Drink oil and lose weight. Please. Don't buy into this crap. Eat an appropriate amount of calories for your size and activity level and stop putting money into this scam author's pockets. If this worked, the stories on every news channel would be non stop. You don't hear much about this diet because it's bogus."
1,"Shangri-La - a fantasy place, a fantasy diet - DOESN'T WORK!","I had very high hopes for this diet, especially since a friend recommended it. I did try it, and I lost 2-3 pounds - and promptly gained them back while still on the diet! I continued the diet, lost those few pounds again, and gained them right back again. I did everything the book said to, too. So after 4 weeks, I gave up.The guy who wrote this is totally living in Shangri-La - now funded by the hard-earned dollars people plunk down for this worthless tome. My local used book store wouldn't even take it - they already had too many copies! A lot of people here are saying it works - maybe it just works for guys? At any rate, it sure didn't work for me. (P.S. The friend who recommended it wound up having the same problem I did; she also gave up on it.)If I could rate this ""0"" stars, I would. Do yourself a favor and skip this book entirely. Go to Jenny Craig or something - at least then maybe you won't feel ripped off."
2,No weight loss after 9 weeks.,"As an appetite suppressant it works suprisingly well. However, I was unable to lose any weight using this approach after following it for 9 weeks. So for me, it didn't work. I am also concerned that ingesting so much pure saturated fat may be detrimental in the long run as there are no long term studies regarding the safety of this approach."
3,The Shangri-La Diet,"A seemingly simple way to lose weight. There's not much too it except to swallow several tablespoons of olive oil, refined at that. Otherwise, it's not much different than any other diet."
4,Seth Roberts' Shangri La Diet,"I have looked at a number of diets and eating plans before, but this one makes a lot of sense to me. I am just starting, so I may have more to add later."
4,Usefull,"The logic of this weight loss method seemed to be convincing to me, and I enjoyed reading the testemonialsIt is well written and quite fun to read.The book is sitting on my coffee table, from where I read parts of it from time to time.I find it motivating, and I will begin to apply it during April. I am looking forward to the experience."
3,An Interesting Idea,"The Shangri-La Diet is a weight loss strategy in which the body's metabolic set point is altered by consuming neutral or novel tasting foods. The author recommends neutral tasting oils like canola or light olive. He also suggests drinking sugar water, or drinking and eating while holding your nose.There is some scientific information presented within this book, and testimonials scattered throughout. I didn't find the book all that satisfying, but I was curious about this diet after reading casually about it from other sources.I don't strongly recommend this title, but it was very inexpensive and satisfied my curiosity.I have not tried the author's suggested techniques."
3,The Shangri-La Dies,"Book is well written and it is an interesting comcept, but not a diet I can live with!"
4,So far so good,"Wanted to try it for myself after doing a ton of research and reading more positive reviews then negative ones. Started it 5 days ago and I can def tell it suppresses my appetite. It's weird, I sit down to eat knowing its time but I'm not ravenous and I just can't eat as much as I normally do. Hopefully the appetite suppressant isn't just a placebo effect, but I don't think it is because I love food and I am never just a little hungry. Hoping to drop 20 lbs, so I will update this review in a month. Hoping to see results, feeling very optimistic!"
2,The Shangri-La Diet,"This was an interesting concept. The book was fun to read and I gave it a reasonable try--3-4 weeks with sugar water and ""eloo"" and following the guidelines of the plan. Unfortunately, I got ""zero"" results in terms of weight loss. --Next...."""
3,Shangri-La Diet,"The concept and book is easy enough to read and understand. I'm not quite sure it works though. Tried it for two months and initially it took away my appetite, but I believe your body get used to what you're doing and it becomes ineffective."
2,Obviously not for everyone,"There hardly need be a book. The whole ""diet"" consists of taking 1-4 tablespoons of extra light olive oil every day with an hour on either side during which one doesn't ingest any flavors. The book is mostly about testaments as to the diet's efficacy and a minuscule amount of semi-supporting research. Also, as it is something one is meant to do for the rest of one's life, I found myself a little averse to the idea. I tried it for four weeks anyway, and did nothing but gain weight despite the fact that I was indeed eating less ""real"" food - I suppose the gain was due to all that extra fat I was ingesting. I won't claim that the diet is a hoax, but it absolutely did not work for me, and I can't risk trying it any longer if I'm to lose this last 20 (well, now more like 30) pounds. There's a website, I think, so if you want to try it, just search the internet for that - don't buy the book."
2,Didn't work for me,"I thought it was an interesting and somewhat plausible theory. I did it for two months (canola oil in the mid-morning and mid-afternoon) but after a couple of pounds it did me no good whatsoever. Your mileage may vary, of course."
2,"Works a little, but pretty gross","This whole diet seems sorta crazy, but I tried it for about a week. It worked OK, but I just couldn't take the drinking pure olive oil anymore. It is grosser than it sounds."
3,"Herman Taller, ca. 1961","Just heard about Seth for the first time, and immediately recalled Herman Taller's book, Calories Don't Count, published in 1961. In it Dr. Taller describes using safflower oil for weight loss."
1,Just another yo-yo diet.,"It is not sustainable to not eat for those amounts of time or to drink olive oil all the time for me, so I couldn't be sure if it worked since I couldn't stick to it."
2,Shangri-La Diet,I read most of the book. I drank the sugar water for approximately 2 weeks. It didn't seem to work for me. I shared the book with my co-worker and she did the oil for close to 1 month. Neither of us got good results.
5,A Shangry Life,"""Incredibly Easy"", ""Surprisingly Inexpensive"" ""Breathtakingly Effective"" I could launch those and dozens of other equally descriptive terms to the wondrous gifts that Dr. Roberts has given us. Not just the book and methods found in it, but the boards were those who have embraced the SLD lifestyle can now discuss, support and report on the changes that this system has brought to our lives. Yes, the system has eliminated my hunger. Yes I have easily gone from 241 pounds to 213 in 8 weeks. Yes I have done so with no hunger. But the most important thing that he has given me is control. I now see food as a thin person sees food. I can enjoy food without the excess of gluttony or the guilt afterwards. I have a tool that I can use the rest of my life to stay healthy, thin and in control. Thank you Dr. Roberts."
5,Keep an open mind...,"I'm so sorry that the one star reviewer didn't try the diet. I think he/she would've been surprised by how well it works. And it's not just for ""couch potatoes."" It's for anyone who wants to lose weight. This country has a terrible obesity problem. I know this program can help, because it helped me.I lost 10% of my body weight in a couple of months on this program. I would like to say as emphatically as I can that the book doesn't contain ""pseudo-science."" The author(a Ph.D professor at one of the country's top universities!) goes to great pains to include material from other scientists and respected journals. And the footnotes are exhaustive! Sometimes when a new idea comes along, it's difficult for some to let go of old dogma. Don't be discouraged by naysayers! Keep an open mind. Try it yourself."
2,Entertaining book about a placebo,"I am so disappointed in this diet. Like all popular diet books the author writes entertainingly and convincingly about his particular wacky diet. He even has the obligatory explanation of how his theories explain the weight Americans have gained in the last three decades.But unfortunately it doesn't work. I tried it for over a month and gained six pounds. I never saw the promised loss of appetite.So if placebos work for you, go for it. Otherwise, get back on the treadmill and wait for the next fad diet along with the rest of us!"
3,Just Started,"I'm just starting it all today--so couldn't give it a fair star rating.The reason for the review is to ask why on earth there are so many duplicate reviews on here???Later . . . I tried the diet for several days and had very unpleasant GI discomfort, so discontinued it. This effect was from the oil, it seems. When I tried the sugar water, it gave me low blood sugar and cravings. The plan just wouldn't work for me.Too bad."
2,Just another Fad Diet,"This book, though interesting, is just another fad diet. I tried it for 4 weeks and all it did was give me diarreha from all the oil I had to drink."
3,Some issues,"The author claims that exercise doesn't make people thin. Ok, but the fact is, marathon runners and ""extreme athletes"" can eat 4,000 calories a day and lose weight. How many calories does Lance Armstrong consume in one day ? Or an NFL athlete ? I dislike the idea of carrying around olive oil that has no taste. To me, that is the opposite of what a balanced diet should be about. I lived in Europe for 8 years, and one reason the Europeans are thinner than Americans is, they walk around, and their entire nation is not one huge conspiracy against walking, like the U.S. is. I see Americans in those carts, driving around instead of walking. The bottom line is, we need to move around and also reduce calories. It is not rocket science. From the Mayo Clinic to the Cooper Institute, they all say this."
3,BEWARE!,"Several of these positive reviews are bogus. They have been posted over and over again using different names. I have not tried this diet so I have no idea if it works. Because of this, I have decided to give it 3 stars in an effort to be as non-intrusive to the rating system as possible. Make sure the reviewers you want to believe have a prior record of reviewing here on Amazon BEFORE you let them convince you to buy this product. JCM"
2,Ho hum,"Not a bad book. Not a good book. A wasted opportunity So much more could have been done with this. Insight into Dalek culture. Insight into the mind of arch traitor Mavic Chen. Insight into the races of the outer galaxies. Even some knowledge of earth history of that period. Katarina, the first of the Doctor's companions to ever perish, does so and, in a particulary nasty way, and, except for Steven, no one really cares. Not even the author. By the story's end, the reader barely even remembers that she existed. Still. At least, the Doctor Who fan has the full story. Continued in The Mutation of Time."
1,buyer beware,"I would not advise anyone to buy this tent. The overall quality is very low.There were no instructions and even the pole identifiers were only pieces of paper glued to each pole section and several had fallen off ,leaving me to figure out where they went. My overall feeling was that this product was madewith the cheapest materials possible and still being able to call it a tent."
4,Great Book,This book is well written and keeps your interest through out by trying to implicateseveral suspects which keeps you guessing who the murderer is.I enjoyed this book and recommend it.
4,Fun mystery,"I had just finished reading The Help, and wanted something light to counter balance it. I downloaded Murder a la Mode to my Kindle several months ago when it was free, and decided to give it a try. I found it to be an enjoyable light mystery - perfect as a summer read and perfect after reading something so heavy. I will probably buy a few of the other Savannah Reid mysteries now."
3,Predictable,"This was a very predictable murder story that everyone has read at least twice and watched on TV at least a dozen times. You probably already know the ending, it's the same as the hundreds of other murder books out there today."
3,A Little Dull,In the first half of the book I found the dialogue hard to digest and the story to unbelievable. I didn't want to finish the book but did persist. The second half was more enjoyable but not enough for me to read another book in this series.
4,Down to Earth,"I have been looking for a good murder mystery series so I am now a new McKevett fan. Savannah Reid is a character I can relate to with her love of food, cats, romance novels and Godiva chocolates. I was really hoping though that she would have caught the killer instead of stumbing into the killer, but that made it all more suspenseful."
4,great little camera,I purchased this camera for my 11yr old son to use for scouts. It is a easy to use good quality camera.
4,:D,"I looove this mug. Its such a beautiful shade of red, very nice looking. Also, these mugs are huge. One of mine already has a chip on it, but I'll leave that to certain people in my house being very clumsy."
1,VERY unsafe.,Chips and cracks very easily. Today the handle of my mug came away from the base with no warning. It was filled with scalding hot coffee. VERY UNSAFE
2,Loved it until it just cracked for no apparent reason,The handle just cracked. Don't know if it was in the dishwasher or in the cupboard when that happened. But I had a green one and the same thing happened to it.
5,Works great.,"Works perfectly fine, no issues, installed fast, easy to install and replace the old one that had broken for me."
5,"AN AMAZING, LIFE CHANGING BOOK","This book fully explains the convexity of math. The author really seems to know what he is talking about. It's almost as if math is somehow fun again. Convexity and Optimization in Rn is just amazing. I cannot stand math, but after I read this book I have had an ephiphany. I used to get B's in math. (actually I still do) But the point is, this book really helped me understand my mathmatics.The author is knowledgeable. I got to meet him at a book signing and he was incredibly nice, funny, and amazing. His words changed my life forever. This book is a MUST READ! TWO THUMBS UP!"
1,Am I missing something?,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! Has absolutely no Floyd material,backstage footage,interviews or live clips,apart from one or two brief shots of Mssrs Gilmour and Mason.Bob Hickey spends the whole disc (two discs in my case) making jokes with his crewmates,focusing on 'chicks' in the crowd,using the tour as his own 'holiday movie' vehicle and trying to be a comedian with anyone who will listen to him.I konw the tag-line says 'this does not contain 2 hours of Pink Floyd' BUT IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY FLOYD AT ALL!!! Mr. Hickey...did you send me the wrong one???Annoyed and cheated...Martin (Floydman)"
1,Making money off the Floyd name,"This is 2 hours of some dude wandering around with a video camera. I found it to be incredibly boring to watch and there is hardly any reference to pink floyd at all. I really wouldn't waste the money on this cheaply made thing. I mean, someone wrote in marker 'A' & 'B' on the disks so you knew which was which. In all honesty, it's a toss up on whether this or my family's home movies are more interesting & related to pink floyd."
1,Random Lock Ups at any time.,"I got one of these to replace an old WRT54G, unfortunately I will be going back to the old router. This unit randomly locks up and will pass no traffic at all. The only way to reset is to pull the plug and reboot. I would like to think it's got something to do with heavy internet traffic such as gaming or file downloads, however the freezes are common and can happen at any time. There's lots of issues with this router, and I recommend looking elsewhere until a firmware update fixes these issues. Honestly it's a terrible piece of equipment right now."
2,Works well if you don't mind rebooting daily!,"Pretty slick and easy to configure, a worthy heir to the WRT54G. Yet, like most of the N routers, it drops randomly the internet connection once a day. Network is still on, but nothing on the internet (DNS?) side until you power cycle the router. I tried 2 different new units, same issue. Even Apple is experiencing the issue with its Apple Airport Extreme. It sounds like a chipset issue with me, which screams that the N draft technology is not ready to ship, as its name indicates!! I went back to my faithful WRT54G, no need to reboot with it!"
2,Doesn't work with Macs,"As one other review pointed out, this router is problematic with macs. The range isn't that good with any of the computers in our house 3 macs 2 pcs. If you have a mac in your home network, do not buy this router."
4,Only one little problem...,"I was replacing my existing Linksys G router with an N router, and since I was happy with my old Linksys, I thought why not try a new Linksys. I received it and setup was very easy - it is indeed smaller than my old G version. Everything works wonderfully except for one little problem - I am currently unable to get it to transmit at full ""N"" speed. I went back and read through the manual and it actually indicates that it's transmission speed is ""only"" 54Mbps. That's actually not too shabby, but I get 130 Mbps on my buddy's Airport router. I tried playing with the advanced settings, but can't keep the signal when I try to increase the transmission speed. Range is great however, and it has been rock solid at 54 Mbps. I'll let sleeping dogs lie for another month or two, then try a 3rd party flash for the router and see if that helps."
1,Tech Support is a KILLER!!!,"I have had my Linksys router for 3 years. I also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn't go through walls very well. I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address.They used to have free support until just very recently. My beef is with the cost of support. 3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for many minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!! I can tell you I spent many hours talking to tech support before this recent change of events. You will need tech support now and again when you change ISPs, go elsewhere."
5,Great,This Linksys WRT150N wireless N home router with 4 Ethernet ports works great and very easy to set up and great price for a N router.
3,Not as good as I hoped for,I've only had this router for a week as of today and it hasn't been dropping the signal or anything like that but it was HECK to setup. I decided to purchase this after my 2 year old Belkin router went haywire. The setup took about 2 days of working with Linksys support over the phone. After a lot of steps and a long phone calls the router is now up and running. I don't think the instructions included with this router are adequate.
2,LINKSYS WRT150N,"This router is expensive and unreliable. It frequently locks up, resulting loss connection, which required adaptor disconnect and reconnect. This happen almost every other day. I am very disappointed with this product."
1,Bad quaility of this wireless router,"I bougth this bad product in February, and I sent to my sob in Colombia. Some weeks ago this router died and now he doen't have any support and I can't return...."
1,Get D-Link DIR-655 instead,"(zero star) This Linksys N router makes wireless experience more miserable than ever. It drops or freezes up randomly. It draws system memory (my memory was always on 50% usage but now drops to 30% after switching to D-Link). Its evil twins, the Linksys N wireless card interrupts the sound card (the volume keeps going up and down and slows down sometimes as if you are playing LP using the wrong rpm). The signal strength is worst than my years old g router. We paid full price to get this router and was reluctant to buy a new one within a year. But the performance was so horrible that we would rather dragging 100ft long cables go around the house instead of 'trying our luck' to get connected wirelessly. No luck to begin with anyway as we had already paid this junk."
1,Doesn't work well with my MacBook,"Revised review. I had this router for 7 weeks and finally gave up on it. I kept losing the internet even though the signal strength was maxed out. It started out working about 95% of the time, but then over the weeks became totally unreliable working less than 50% of the time.CompUSA allowed me to return it and I got another Linksys, but this one is a ""G"" router. I have a macbook (wireless) and a PC (ethernet) connected. The ""G"" router, so far, has been flawless. The sales rep says the problem with ""N"" routers is they haven't established the final ""protocol"" (I believe was the term he used) and so there may be issues with ""N"" routers. I am not the most tech savy guy, but I can tell you the wrt150""N"" router was a total bust, while my linksys ""G"" router works great."
1,Solid Product,"Originally, I wrote a very positive review of this product. Then, just short of a year, the router stopped working. Although I had the product less than a year, Linksys refused to honor the warranty, claiming that some date other than my acquisition of the product triggered the warranty. The technician told me ""the luck is not with you,"" and informed me that Linksys may be able to fix the router, but I would have to pay $30 to find out. Quite simply, Linksys doesn't stand behind their products, and their customer service representatives are smug, condescending and unhelpful.Instead of paying $30 to see if they would be able to fix my router, I purchased a router from Netgear, and I've been quite pleased with it."
2,Dropped connections on wireless,"We've had this unit for several months. The wireless part works OK most of the time, but on an almost daily basis it drops the connection to the laptop. The router has essentially disappeared as it no longer shows up as an available wireless network. We are forced to unplug the power on the router to recycle it and things connect up again.Very annoying."
4,Not bad,"I purchased this router to replace an older linksys router that was still functioning but slowing down. As an aside, tech support was always amazed out how old a model I used which speaks well of the brand and longevity of linksys products.I do not notice any difference in connection speeds or distance from the receiver than my older model. I do however notice a HUGE difference in downloading times. When uploading to my website the time is probably cut in half. That alone was worth the upgrade.It installed painlessly on four computers for me, one with Vista, which I have very little experience using. Overall, I'm very pleased and in the future I'll buy both the modem and the router."
2,Works as advertised,"I bought this router to replace a failing DLink. Setup was simple and straight forward. It's been running for about 4 hours with no hiccups. My new XBox 360 connected without any issues and online gameplay is as smooth as it was on a wired connection. Overall a good solid router, once the firmware is fixed. Had a major issue as soon as I tried to connect to WoW. It seems that the previous reviews were correct. Any internet intense workload kills the router outright. The fix explained in previous reviews was spot on. If you're technically inclined, this router is great, however, for the daily user, it's more trouble than it's worth. Linksys needs to step up their game and fix their product. I won't be recommending this product."
1,works some times but it is sporadic.,"Worked fine for a couple of months, but now this router keeps dropping the signal. It goes from 100% to 0% and then randomly picks it back up again. The whole time it says it is ""connected."" It's basically unusable. No amount of setting adjustment seems to correct this. I'm sure it's coming from the router because every device on the network has this problem. Any kind of tech help assumes you have weak signal, which is not the case. Overall a disappointing product."
1,Crashes constantly,"This router crashes at least once an hour and can lose connection every 10 minutes or more, especially when trying to download files using bittorrent. It also seems to do a terrible job of keeping a stable connection for multiple machines at once. I've used routers at least six years ago that held a connection better than this machine. It's surprising that Linksys would release something so incredibly buggy years later."
1,defective product,"I bought a defective LINKSYS WRT150N. After less than one week operation all the lights starting blinking, and after an hour on the phone with LINKSYS support then told me the router was defective and to return it. Has anybody else had this bad experience?This should have five lemons, but I had to rate it one star to get the review!"
4,Excellent Cheap Router to setup Wireless Bridge with DD-WRT,This router work very well with DD-WRT FW. I needed the router to bring Internet connection to my MadiaRoom. The router worked just like as its configured in [...]
4,Good router for the new standard: To a degree...,"This LinkSys wireless router is of the 'draft N' variety as all know. The packaging of the function of this thing is adequate but not as robust for the standard set forth i.e. it likes to overheat and konk out. I guess it's the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) function of the router that generates the heat. Heat kills electronics. Keep a fan on it or better yet, install an internal fan (if you have the skills) that LinkSys so conveniently left out of the design by using the older A/B/G case that ran at slower speeds set forth by those drafts, thereby generating less heat. Heat slows down bandwidth and this LinkSys is it's own enemy in that regard. Buy with caution and a cooling device on standby as this router will need it. Keep it cooled and it'll work flawlessly."
4,Router N,I like this product a lot. My kids are using their DS Lites with it and enjoy having competition around the world. I have a MAC and enjoy using it. Will b adding more to my network.
3,"Good Product --Maybe, Lousey Support","It was easy enough to plug into one computer but I was not able to get to work on the wireless unit. After 2 hours trying to get it to work via a chat room support environment and having to break the connection without the problem being solved I'm convinced I should have gone elsewhere, to a manufacturer who gives vocal support. Try running across the house from one computer to the other while trying to follow instructions..."
4,Works after a bit of effort to install,"This is my first crack at setting up a wireless network. I got the WRT150N primarily for extended range. Did this last night.Installation was a bit tricky for my home network. I get Internet access via a DSL modem/router. After installation via setup disk I could not access the Internet. Finally realized that I needed to manually configure the WRT150N to be on a different network (192.168.2.0) rather than the default network number (192.168.1.0) After that, Internet access OK. Can also print to HP C6180 via wireless-G .At present am leaving the WRT150N up and running to verify that it continure to provide a reliable connection."
2,Range no better than my G Lynksys router,"I bought this primarily for the advertized increased range. My G router will work in our clubhouse a 150 feet from my back bedroom where this is located. The setup using the lynksys software did not work for me, but I was able to get it working manually. I updated the firmwear and reset my Toshiba laptop for type N, updated the laptop adapter to latest drivers. The reliability in the house was excellent; in the clubhouse, the range was no better than the G router, one to two bars and frequent dropout. I worked with it for several weeks, updated my adapter, varied settings. Speed showed as 130 Mhz and connection type showed as type N on my laptop. I discovered that the built-in N adapter in my laptop (Intel 4965agn) lists several routers that are recommended but none from lynksys. Haven't been able to find that page again so I can't link it here. I returned the router, as it did not appear to meet expectations based on its range."
3,Great Intro,"This is a great intro do MS-DOS, but it doesn't really deal at all with the configuration and architecture of the operating system. Like the title says, it is a short, concise guide to batch files and how to use them. If you want to learn to configure your operating environment using AUTOEXEC.BAT, but were afraid of messing something up, this book is a handy little guide. Especially good for beginners."
3,Good beginning.,"Banco would not fully develop their sound until their masterpiece Come in Un'ultima Cena. On that recording their sense of composition and melody is nothing short of brilliant. Here they are just beginning to put their sound together. As a result they can come across as trying a bit too hard. Where they are clearly exceptional musicians the efforts on this disc seem to lean toward overplaying (showing off their chops)rather than using their considerable skill to fully develop and present their compositions. There is a wee bit too much of the entire band playing identical lines of musical progression at a frantic pace. This is a more primitive beginning not unlike Le Orme's Collage. They would slow down and mature in subsequent recordings. Still, there are some fine moments here and it is worth adding to the prog collection...Simon"
2,"I""M AMAZED AT ALL THE 5 STAR REVIEWS","Someone needs to be objective here. I've got about 2000 cd's in mostly the guitar and blues genre and this guy is at best ordinary. Like a TINSLEY ELLIS without most of the chops / absolutely no songs and an average voice.He talks about 40 years of playing the guitar. Hell , this would not be classed good playing for a student with 12 month experience. His tone is painful at times and if you think I'm harsh, have a listen to TINSLEY ELLIS. There are some similarities, but one is excellent and one isn't.I can see that a fully drunk crowd around 2 in the morning will really get down to this, but you have to be kiding when you call this guy a BLUES MASTER. There must be at least a few hundred players with more legit claims to that title.I've got 3 of BRYAN LEE's cds and played them continuously for a couple of weeks as I thought I was missing something as this style of blues is normaly right up my alley ( see my reviews ), but it did not get any better."
4,Works like it should - Nice sound - Minor Performance Gains,"First - '97 Jeep Wrangler TJ 2.5L.If you're expecting any seat of the pants feel from this cat-back - Look elsewhere. I guess if you're expecting any type of 'seat of the pants' feel for anything with the 2.5L - buy a turbo.On to the actual product. It works. The majority of my exhaust system rusted out (16 years old, 140K), so it was time for a replacement. The Dynomax has a nice low, throaty growl (maybe grumble is a better word here) that isn't obnoxious. Noticeable, but not overpowering. Sounds like burning 'cleaner' with the higher CFM output. Minimal performance gains though, as expected. Holds speed a little better, gets up to speed a touch quicker. That's about it.I gave it four stars only because the tailpipe sticks out a little further than I would like, as other people have said. Had it on for a little over a month now and no issues whatsoever. Great product if you are expecting exactly what they send you and nothing more."
4,A wealth of forgotten history,"""Southern Quakers and Slavery"" was first published in 1896. It is not a work of popular history, and presents no Big Ideas or sweeping generalizations. But for those of us interested in rarely-visited corners of American history, it presents a wealth of detailed information that more recent historians seem to have missed. Weeks' research focuses on a careful reading of the journals of ""Traveling Friends"" who visited the early Quaker communities of the South, and on the records of those communities. It is the only work of Quaker history I have yet found that helps the reader understand what was really going on in those communities from the late 17th to the 19th century. There are also some useful Appendices, with information, dates and other statistics for meetings in VA, the Carolinas, and Tennessee."
3,Wearisome after a time,"After setting the stage in volume I, Roosevelt falls into a hero worship of the famous names of the frontier and a larger than life portrait of the average, rifle-slinging frontiersman and backwoodsman (words Roosevelt equates with superheroes). While it would be improper to say that Roosevelt strictly confined his second volume to the little details, every page seems to resound with the latest Indian skirmish, a gruesome tomahawking, a white foray or retaliation, and the daily peril of Indian attacks. The American Revolution finds frequent appearance as the guiding backdrop to this volume, with the result being the repeated treatments of the British encouraging the Indians (through payments and promises) to set upon the American settlers. Overall a more specific volume than the first, I left the book thinking the whole nothing but an endless series of Indian battles."
2,A Flat Tire,"A mediocre racing game for the GBA that features various modes such as Arcade or Championship plus bonus modes such as Bog War and Car Crusher.The gameplay is slow and herky-jerky. The trucks are easily prone to flip over and interupt the gameplay. The trucks also tend to feel slippery, as if there is a sheet of ice.The background graphics are extremely blocky. The truck itself is pixelated and the animation is choppy.The only redeeming value of this game are the many different modes. Only worth it if you can find it really cheap."
5,A pleasant album from Nina,"I was surprised when i read the other comments. Well, ok, i am a huge Nina Hagen fan and like almost everything she produces...but this album is actually very good. It has songs that even my mother listens to (Ave Maria). I love the tracks Super freak family and Love heart attack. It isn't the best album, but is definitely worth buying!!!!! Enjoy it, I do."
4,Especially useful for brunch and breakfast entertaining,"Gordon, the Innkeeper of Nantucket House in Chatham on Cape Cod, has collected recipes from Inns and B & B's around the country that can be prepared the night before and cooked the next day.Naturally many of these are breakfast or brunch oriented and most are baked, like Spiced Pear French Toast, Cinnamon Crunch Coffee Cake, Seafood Brunch Strata, Bacon and Egg Lasagna, Easy Wild Rice Quiche.A short appetizer chapter includes cheese balls and dips as well as chicken wings and Mushroom Rolls and for dinner there's Sweet Potato Casserole, Salmon Mexicana, or Baked Barbecued Beef Brisket.Some recipes use shortcut ingredients like canned soups or frozen bread dough and the variety of sources means there's something to appeal to everyone. This is a folksy book which will chiefly appeal to those who like to entertain for breakfast or brunch.--Portsmouth herald"
1,unhappy,"It has been one month sibce the book was shipped, as of today 04/04/08 it still has not arrived"
3,great for big groups,"Since I have large family, it is much easier to cook ahead of time and put it in the morning of. Has some great recipes in it."
4,"""Sleep On It"" Order",The item was in excellent condition (like new) and arrived in a timely manner. I would buy from this sender again.
5,Sleep on it cookbook,"I really like this cookbook.The recipes are delicious, easy and most ingredients in the recipes are those that I keep stockedA+ all the way."
5,Nice sounding song transfers from a famous British dance band,"Avid records did a nice job with the restoration of this material. Frankly, I can't tell if they mastered it from good LP releases or the original 78s, but the sound is very honest. I am always amazed at how cohesive this orchestra was on ""hot"" (or uptempo) numbers because Hylton's arrangements are old 20s style with massive ensemble figures. The band is always tight and perfectly together. Intonation is always spot on. Even though this was not a Swing band in any sense, Hylton was still ""keeping up"" during the early Swing Era (listen to the nice, but not really Swing rendition of the song ""Swing is in the Air."") Jack had very good musicians, and was doubtless a real taskmaster. If you combine this CD with the old ASV release of She Shall Have Music, and Hot Hylton on the Retrieval label you'll have an excellent collection of Hylton's best work."
5,Wising Up the Marks: A Review.,"Alongside the earlier works by Eric Mottram and Jennie Skerl, Mr. Murphy offers the reader an insight into the life of William Burroughs as well an in depth analysis of his works. ''Wising Up the Marks'' is an indispensable work for both the Burroughs's collector and academic historian alike."
2,Disappointing coming from Murray,"David Murray has always been one of my favorite musicians, but this album came as a bit of a disappointment. Where is the fire of his organ quartet w/ Don Pullen? Where is the grace and passion of his octet? Where is, well, anything? This is not David Murray the avant-garde genuis. There are some interesting sounds here, but it seems more like a bad experiment with commercial music than a music explosion like ""New Life,"" or ""The Hill."" The good news is that there is not a dearth of fantastic material by Murray out there, so the barrel is too big to be ruined by one or two less-than-fresh apples."
2,beautiful! but mine chipped in less than one year :(,"I have a moissanite ... SO beautiful. A huge piece chipped off in less than 1 year, although my diamond (similar wear and tear) lasted 18 years with nary a scratch. I thought moissanites were supposed to be hard! But apparently that's different from shatter-proof :("
2,A disappointment,"I really was hoping this ring would look similar to a diamond but when I got it, right away I could tell it wasn't even close. Then I put it up against a real diamond and two cubic zirconia rings and it absolutely looks more like a CZ than anything else. I bought this ring based on the other two good reviews but I have to disagree, this ring is a disappointment. Save your money and just buy a CZ or spend more and buy the real thing."
4,This book helped me learn to live with a chronic illness.,"I think it took a lot of courage for Ms. Szasz to write this book. It really delves into her past personal life and shows a person how to try and deal with life on a day to day basis. Having a chronic illness is no piece of cake and to me when I read about her getting up and going to work everyday and trying to live as normal a life as possible, it encouraged me to do the same. Some may say that it gives readers a sense that they will go through exactly what the author has, but if the patient has been properly educated by their physician that shouldn't happen. By the time I finished her book, like one other stated I felt that I just said goodbye to a close friend and also 'Thank You'. Thank you, not only for showing me that you can live a normal life, but in all honesty, you should without ever lowering your expectations or changing your dreams."
3,"Although sometimes alarming, this is an arresting book","Ms. Szasz' journey with lupus is decidedly atypical, and could unduly alarm many who suffer from lupus. Yet, her pluckiness and approach to her illness can help the faint of heart advocate for themselves in dealing with their illness and with their physicians. Although I often felt that her relational functionings left something to be desired, and felt this was a book I wouldn't want to own, in the end, I had formed an affection for her. I often remember and savor the lessons I learned and her wry wit. Finishing the book was like saying goodbye to an enigmatic friend who has lived life with bravery and zest, and who taught you a few flourishes along the way..This is not a book which details symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of lupus, but rather, as the author states, a book about what it is like to live daily with a chronic illness whose effects are not readily apparent nor understood by those who surround its target."
5,"Smart woman, strong character","This book is highly recommendable for anyone who has to contend with disease and physicians, which is most of us. Suzy Szasz, daughter of the brilliant psychiatrist-philosopher Thomas Szasz, contends with the vicissitudes of health and life intelligently and gracefully. Despite her debilitating condition she isn't debilitated: she doesn't become the obligatory American victim. Some readers will resent her relentless stand against personal adversity since it tilts against the modern American spirit. Others will admire her and take away the unspoken lessons of her quiet courage. You will find no whining in this book and no scapegoating. There is an implicit warning, though: you had better be armed with knowledge before you hand yourself over to the doctors. Your interests may not be identical to theirs"
2,Interesting Story of a Journey,"I, too, was fascinated with the author's journey and disturbed by her relationships with others. She is judgemental and critical of those upon whom she relies. And she relies on them very, very much. Obviously she comes from wealth and means,never struggling with the pain and difficulties that come from financial ruin, dealing with Social Security Disability, poverty and working, even while very sick, when your very survival depends upon it. Not all of us have Wealthy Doctor Daddy to rescue us whenever we are in trouble. Having said that, I relate to and admire her chutzpah in dealing with her doctors, her efforts to be informed and educated about her illness and her willingness to take responsibility for managing her illness. Her story is most useful in showing persons with chronic illness how to manage their care and advocate for themselves. It is a compelling story, nonetheless!"
4,Gods Best Secret,This was birthday gift for my brother and he love it. I'll need to order another one for my self in the future.
5,A national treasure,"James Thurber is simply amazing both as a writer and graphic artist. His dry sense of humor is LOL, with philosophical content. His illustrations are whimsical, full of motion, and have the simplicity of Neanderthal cave paintings. An absolutely brilliant Man!"
3,Top Trumps!,"This has been a valuable resource over the years. My first goat was a 125cc model and with the help of this manual, i learnt all about the care and maintenance needed.I plan, in the summer, to get another 125cc and then take them on a cross country trek through Romford via Stratford. Highly recommended is the section on the uses of the milk, meat and hair and the methods of reconstruction if any bits go missing."
3,Major error in feeding advice: no copper in minerals,"The author states ""When using mineral feed for goats you must be careful that it is free of copper...mineral feed for sheep also conforms to the requirements for goats"" Not true. Sheep must not have copper, but goats do need it."
2,Okay for the under-15 crowd but....,"If you're looking for a livestock giftbook for a child under 15 years of age, buy this book. It is an easy read, full of excellent photos, and, here and there, it has some useful tips.Otherwise, get Raising Meat Goats For Profit and/or Goat Husbandry."
4,Aces,"The New Goat Handbook updates and remedies most of the deficiencies of its predecessor, The Old Goat Handbook. While goats' housing, care and feeding needs have changed little since the days of Homer, recent veterinary research has made great strides in the field of goat health and fitness. The special new chapter on using goat milk, meat and hair offers useful and valuable information, but I object to the book's strictly utilitarian approach to goating. Goats are also beautiful, intelligent animals that make loving, loyal companions."
3,Before Buying the Farm,"Storey's Guide to Raising Dairy Goats, 4th Edition: Breeds, Care, Dairying, Marketing is a better resource. This one is good for beginners."
4,A nice little reference,"The compact size of this book makes it easy to keep handy, and it is full of useful information. Some may (through personal experience) disagree with parts of it, but it will be invaluable to any new owner as it covers such an array of topics. The easily readable style doesn't talk down to you, but is as if you have a friend talking to you. I think it is excellent."
2,Not for small land owners trying to clear some woods,From a guy who likes playing farmer after work and on the weekends...I first want the goats to help clear about 7 acres of thick woods and brush after that I would like to start milking. Just enough for family and friends when they stop by. This book didn't get me any closer to the knowledge level I would like to be at to start either of these projects. It assumes that the reader knows more than he or she probably does in some sections then breaks things down to the most dull basic level in others.
3,Interesting,Makes for an interesting read about goats but i think it would scare off a lot of new comers to the art of raising goats
1,Better sign language books available at Amazon,"I have studied American Sign Language for three years now, and I would not recommend this book. This book lists individual signs, many of which are SEE signs or outdated. Like many beginners, this was my first book...a lot of bookstores sell it at the top of their lists--I'm not sure why. If you are interested in signing a song to a hearing audience (these signs strung together wouldn't make any sense in American Sign Language) this book may be for you. But if you are looking at interpreting or real communication with a Deaf person, look elsewhere! Here are some recommended books, all of which are here at Amazon: Signing Naturally (this is my favorite), Learning American Sign Language, The American Sign Language Phrase Book"
4,Great book for beginners,I think this is a great book for anyone who wants to learn the meaning of different signs. The only drawback is that it doesn't teach phrases that one could use on a daily basis.
4,great value,The order arrived in great shape and in a timely manner. Both of these qualities are sadly lacking sometimes. This book is a terrific help for the classes that my wife is taking.
3,This book is not current,"I was asked to purchase this book as a text for a SIGNING class at a local education center. The class was taught by a totally deaf woman who has used this book as the primary textbook for 10 years. She admitted during class that it was the best book available then but there may be better text available now. Before you buy, make sure you read all reviews and understand the difference between basic signing and ASL. They are not the same and if you try to communicate with a deaf person who has learned ASL, they may not understand you."
3,Okay.,"has great pictures, but doesn't really teach you practical ways to communicate with the deaf. I'd try for another book for that purpose,but this is great for a reference for common words."
3,It's okay.,"I had to get this book for a class that I was taking. I think it does the job for the most part, but some of the language is really dated. There are newer variations to some of the signs. I like that it gives you diagrams, examples, and origins to how the sign was created. This one is good but I think you'd benefit from a newer textbook."
2,Signs depicted no longer in frequent use,"While many of us revered and learned to sign with this book in the 80's, the lack of updating will hamper anyone trying to learn on their own. Many of the signs (especially those in the chapter on familial relationships) are simply no longer used. The book does contain an extensive (and still current!) section on religious signs, an area not covered by many sign manuals."
3,"Good for a Start, but Need to Move On","The Joy of Signing is a fine book for starting to learn the signs used in the Deaf community. But, one must realize that there are a number of signs presented that are not used in ASL (the language of the Deaf community). If you are looking to learn Signed English, then you'll do fine; but if you want to learn ASL, you may just want to go to another book since this one is based on English, not ASL. If you're interested in ASL, consider ""A Basic Course in American Sign Language"" (O'Rourke). If you just want to learn some signs to get by, ""The Joy of Signing"" will be okay."
1,Not based on deaf culture,"This book was used in my first asl class, which was offered by a community college. It's easy and I loved it. However, when I got into more advanced, for-credit classes, I realized that much of what I had learned was obsolete or just plain unusual. I had to stop using it as a refrence because I was doing poorly on tests and my new teacher (who was deaf) had trouble understanding me. Even the number signs in this book are not the common ones used. I was frustrated that I had spent so much time memorizing these signs, and now had to not only learn new ones, but unlearn the old ones. I actually had a harder time in 101 than people who had never signed. I showed the book to my deaf teacher and she signed back ""Not deaf culture."" Enough said."
3,The Joy of Signing,"This book has many accurate signs, and I recommend it to anyone who is currently taking a Sign Language course. However, if you plan to just buy the book and hope to be fluent, it won't work. The signs are there, but the grammar is not. Sign Language does not follow English grammar, it has a sophisticated grammar of it's own, and you must also learn that to be understood. If you are interested in communicating with the Deaf, take a class, if you are in a class and want to enhance your vocabulary...the book is great!"
5,Excellent signing book!,"I've used this book for six months and have found it to be very helpful and easy to use. Words are arranged topically; there is also an alphabetized index. The drawings are superb -- they are quite clear and include written instructions regarding movement required. Because it was published in the 80's, some of the signs are not quite current. My friend and I love to use it and have learned a lot."
1,The Joy of Signing...not ASL,"I bought the book ""The Joy of Signing"" as recommended by a friend and thought it was a good source to learn to speak to deaf people. However, one day at my job, I was signing to a woman who is deaf and she did not understand me. She asked me where I leared that and I told her from ""The Joy of Signing"". She told me that book is a bad one to use and get one from the official American Sign Language (ASL) instead. Buy another book if you want to effectivly communicate."
4,"This is a very good book, wish it had more signs.","Joy of signing is very good,for someone like me, who is trying to learn more signs. Only thing is, i wish it could cover all the sign that the hearing impaired uses. I find myself using it as a cross reference to other books. To sum it all up this book has helped me a lot and contuines to help. Thank you for writing this book."
1,"obsolete, not really usable","I picked up this book when I began a degree in ASL. I thought it would give me some kind of head start. There are a couple signs in there that you might look up one day, but you could easily find them on the net. I am no expert in ASL Lingusitics, but I assure you, I know deaf people aren't using this book or recommending it. It is a dinosaur. The progressive ASL books would be the ones currently being published by DAWN SIGN PRESS and GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY PRESS. They, would be the experts in this field- the people who sign 24/7. Spend the money elsewhere. Videos for DSP and GUP are also better than others."
1,Joy of signing,Too hard to use for the non-signer with a limited amount of time to spend. I will put it in a resale bin.
3,cover on book faded,The book arrrived within the alloted time frame. But the book came with a little damage on the top and the cover was faded.
1,Horrible picture makes this too annoying to watch,"After popping in this DVD and seeing the picture I thought something was wrong with my TV the image was so poor. The picture was extremely grainy, and there was a horrible ""screen"" effect making this dvd unwatchable. Fortunately, when I put in another dvd, the picture was crisp and beautiful on my 40"" HDTV. If you don't mind the look of a poor-quality video, buy this, but beware, the quality is extremely bad."
3,corpsmen's viewpoint,"This book is very easy to understand,it appears straight foreward and informative. This book also provides a step by step guide on many of the procedures.I would call it an essential text for all I.D.C.'s and 8404 Corpsmen."
4,Cop This,Don't sleep on this album... Lots of dope tracks...Rasco is one of the most underrated MC's....
5,Face to face with 80's best,"Amazing!! This could probably be one of 80's music most remarcable albums. Hall & Oates with their very different styles on music (one gosspell and blues, the other one soft rock, jazz) really made a huge contribution to music. This duet, has left it's print in the history of music.The songs presented on this cd are for collectors. Don't miss the opportunitie of getting it. YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS BUY!!!!!VanZandt...97.7 fm"
4,Great collection of classics,"Great collection of Hall & Oates classics, but a bit heavy on later songs from Arista. Notably missing ""You Make My Dreams Come True""."
4,I love this Music,"I have this CD, I have more music by Xuxa and I found in this Dance Album an example of the multi-facetic work of Xuxa music, The album has ""punch"", the name reffers it: Dance. One day, I tested a car audiosystem with this album and ""Magia Total"" and I experienced a great charge of Dance music. The songs are fresh. Is a good Album to the people who likes dance music, iF you wish to create a Show with dancers, this album may helps you."
1,Of poor quality,"The poor quality of this guide does not exist within the spoilers the guide provides, but rather the content of the guide that is essentially not in-depth. The guide is full of lots of screenshots but they don't really depict anything, just what's going on in the story. The walkthrough doesn't help much. It's more of walkthrough designed for the one who wants to go through the game quickly without getting the secrets and such (which the guide doesn't exactly touch base with either). The walkthrough isn't too confusing but the information provided is just for those who only care about completeing the game. If you're one who actually needs help with the game then the guide can be a life-saver. But if you're looking to find all the secrets and such then look to GameFAQs or somewhere else on the net."
5,Wolfgang Samuel does it again!,"Wolfgang Samuel does it again... After penning German Boy, a book relating his own experiences as a German youth fighting for survival at the end of WWII, Samuel examines the post-World War II Cold War through the eyes of American air force flyers. As a reader, I found it refreshing that throughout the book Samuel allowed military aviators to tell their own stories. But more importantly, he puts the events and activities into historical context so that readers who are not steeped in the history of the time understand the critical importance of the Cold War air effort documented by him. Early on, we hear American flyers saying ""I Always Wanted to Fly"" but I found the stories to be about commitment, motivation, dedication and the determined fight for the very freedoms we enjoy everyday. This book is a must read for history buffs and an adventurous, exciting and engaging work for any reader interested in the Cold War."
5,I Always Wanted to Fly,"Another outstanding book by Wolfgang Samuel as he presents another facet of history in way it always needed to be told. We tend to look at history from the perspective of those who shape history - the politicians and statesmen, but here we see it from the perspective of those who make history - the military, as they go about doing their job. So eloquently written that the reader can't help but feel like being along on the mission as part of the crew - exciting, frightening and an unforgetable experience. The author has made it possible for the general public to get a taste of the airmen's world and to look behind the scenes of the many battles and wars fought since the end of World War 11. It makes one proud and appreciative of our Cold War Airmen, and thankful to them for a job well done. Highly recommend this book, as it's an eye opener for anyone who wants to know what has been going on during the last fifty five years."
4,An excellent first-person history of the cold war,"Retired aviator Wolfgang Samuel has produced another enjoyable,readable collection of stories by cold war era combat pilots. The stories are uniformly interesting, some covering well-known events, such as the Berlin Airlift, others on topics seldom covered in similar works. The chapters on strategic reconnaissance are very good, and will be an eye opener for younger readers. Overall, a great read for those interested in military aviation history."
5,Remarkable,"Tavis' story is truely inspiring. He was eloquent in his rendition of his life experiences. I would recommend that this book is required reading in schools. It teaches that obstacles doesn't mean give up. Obstacles may mean choose a different path and to have FAITH in GOD . At 38, I was inspired and remined that 'through Christ anything is possible'. I am so proud of Tavis. He did not have anything handed to him, he made his way with pure ingenuity and hard work. GREAT JOB TAVIS!!!!"
4,Historical and Relevant,"I applaud Mr. Smiley for his detailed account of African-American stories and the way that he connected them to Historical events. He, in this book, successfully gave a description of how so many have grown up in Urban America."
3,Mixed Emotions,"The brutal beating with the extension cord was probably the saddest thing I've read in a while. Aside from that, the book was just ok for me. I found myself shaking my head that Tavis would show up on a college's doorstep without tuition, a dorm assignment, etc. I just really didn't believe he was that naive or that his parents were just that stubborn. The book was easy to read, with really short chapters that weren't bogged down with useless info. Each chapter was straight to the point. Worth a read."
4,A Good Read,I truly enjoyed this book. I totally agree with another reader...the chapters are not unnecessarily bogged down with additional information which made the book very easy to read. His story is very encouraging and is a testament that there is no obstacle you cannot overcome if you have the faith and determination Tavis displayed in this book.Although I may not have had the heart to make some of the moves he did i.e. (taking an unpaid position away from home with no means of income) look where he is today...God Bless him!
5,"An Enjoyable, Enlightening Read","Tavis Smiley writes an enjoyable, enlightening, easy-to-read story of his upbringing in middle America. Though at times fighting against a sometimes harsh upbringing in a committed Christian home, Smiley's work repeatedly hearkens back to the lessons he learned in that very home. He teaches how anyone can move beyond negative life experiences, be they in the home or in society, to a place of meaning and success in life.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction ,Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care And Spiritual Direction, and Soul Physicians."
5,Growing up takes time,"Tavis Smiley's review of growing up in America is a very detailed, heart warming account that brings you directly into the family. His way of writing this book has made understanding the things that he encountered relevant to today. Many children are experiencing the same things that he has experienced and they have hope because he made it and they can too. Tavis has giving hope and encouragement to America's youth.This book also brings to light that the American dream is still available and it has no respect of persons. It is available to anyone who has the inspiration and the dream of achieving.I loved every page and it is worth the time to read and digest, ponder and read again."
4,batplane review,"Overall this is a great toy.There are no real problems with the toy exept that the wings come off some times and the top is a little crooked. Also the top wares out quickly, but its quite durable. I like the cockpit its pretty cool and i like the extra seat. The colors are neat and so is the figure. GREAT TOY !!!"
2,Whats up Hasbro??,"Ok; so, this isnt as bad as some recent attempts by Hasbro. However, this is just another in the long line of ""how can we screw up the batman line?""If Hasbro is wondering WHY batman isn't selling, perhaps they should ask, ""What have we done that's new?""This repaint is better than the Ninja Knight Force batmobile (that hideous lime green one), however, I just dont see this anywhere in the comics or series. Where do they come up with these sissified colors and ideas?It's not that this is a bad batmobile; it's more that there's two others in this same make. I personally want hasbro to quit repainting Batman toys, and start selling new stuff. Quality stuff. It's just the same one as before, except its blue, and has bats on it. Very imaginative (not!)"
5,love the look,daughter hasnt used these yet but she might le me use them. she loves these as well as her other rachael raye gifts
2,"Progressive International 9 Inch Silicone Gripper Tongs, (green)","When I first received the silicone gripper tongs it work okay on lighter items. As I continue to use it in frying heavier foods like chicken, pork chops, steaks and even trying to turn bacon, it does not grip firmly or lift these items out of the pan without falling off from the grip. Stainless steal tongs work better and has a better grip. I thought the silicone gripper tongs would be more resourseful, especially using them in a non-stick pan. I am disappointed and not happy with these tongs."
5,Great!,These are a great pair of tongs! I needed a pair for my non-stick cookware and am so glad I found these! They have nice little ridges in the grippers to allow a better hold on the food. My favorite feature is the locking mechanism. Just pull the little tab and they are closed!
1,Silicone Tongs,"Broke first time I used them. Total garbage, a real rip off. Can buy dollar store ones that last for years!!!!"
5,Good product,Easy to use. I ordered the 12 inch tongs as well since I liked the 9 inch so much. Both are good purchases.
5,love these!,"These are perfect for our use. I've had utensils where the silicone part was too soft to actually be of use, but these are solid enough to use for anything, from baking sheet to the nonstick pan. Easy to turn and cook a whole range of foods - gyoza, bacon, fish sticks, etc. I'd buy more if I had the space!"
2,Works Well - Bad Materials,"Work fine as tongs, but after a time, the metal tips start to tear through the silicone paddles. Very bad."
3,Nice samples...poor pedal,"As with all multi-effects, some presets are great...some not. I love the AC30 & the Fender Blackface amp models in this...VERY nice with my Johnson Tele (using a twin-blade humbucker in the bridge position). THe pedal doesn't really work well..at all. But, I didn't buy it for the pedal...and there's a jack for plugging in an external (quality) pedal if you think you might use this live.I paid about $70 for this. Would I buy it again? Probably so. I'd certainly shop around, but...for what you get for the money it was hard to beat. I also like the programming flexibility. Some say it can be difficult, yet I've had other Behringer Vamp series and once you learn it...you'll be fine. So far...I haven't found a need to mod anything except flanger/phaser timings. Not a bad device...just don't put faith in the pedal."
3,Good product,"I like this product. It packs a large number of effects and settings into a small package. The sound is great. I feel that the interface leaves something to be desired but as a starter digital effects pedal goes, I think this is a good value."
5,"After Three years, its still working great","I heard a lot of negative things about Behringer pedals, but obviously they have never used this one, I was told it was cheap and would break in less than a month but I have had it for three years now and it still works perfectly fine. It is amazing for even twice it's price, a good buy."
5,A must have for embedded software with EE background,"I have read numerous RTOS books which includes books from Labrose and Qing Li. I think this book delivers the best explanation on RTOS concept. Unlike Labrose and Qing Li's book that throw you every details of a full working RTOS components, this books take an alternative to slowly and clearly explain why should we have this features in RTOS, and take you through slowly from real life problem to code implementation.Yet, RTOS is only 2 chapters in this book. This book has many more to offer which include software requirement analysis, design, modeling, documentation, safety critical system and so on. This is especially valuable to people like me whom had not receive any formal training in software engineering.EE engineers, if you have already mastered embedded C/C++ for small project, this is the book that can help you to move on to building larger embedded software project."
5,Another great book with southern charm,"I became a fan of Cassandra King last year and this book is another great one! It truly portrays the strong southern woman and I like the different points of view. If you want another touch of the south, listen to the audio book."
4,You gotta be a Dixie Darling,"Cassandra King can capture a Southern Belle and she does in The Same Sweet Girls story. You almost have to be a Dixie Darling yourself to fully appreciate each of these women, however, and from the reviews not every reader does. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book almost as much as The Sunday Wife. I like King's style of writing, and I know these people she's talking about even though they drive you crazy at times.I do wonder, however, how many loyal daughters of the W, the REAL W, Mississippi University for Women in Mississippi, the oldest state supported college for women in the country, will rise up in arms because King has moved their beloved alma mater over into Alabama and even brought along its spiral fire escapes. Poetic license no doubt, but as I read, I put it back where it belonged as there are many such friends there who would fit the cast as well. If you belong to one of these groups, you'll like King's story even better."
1,"Vapid, stupid and derivative","This is one of the dullest chick lit derivatives of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and their adventures, or misadventures. It is full of misery, poorly developed characters, and is so formulaic that I predicted the outcome after about 50 pages, at which point I could no longer stomach these ego-driven, falsely sweet dolts. Don't waste your money!"
5,SSGs,"I'm 15 years old, I read this book to pass the time, and I fell in love with it. It's an amazing story, I got goosebumps when I finished it."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I really like ""The Sunday Wife,"" and I couldn't wait for this book. Now that I've read it, I am disappointed. I thought the conversations were too glib and the ""crisis"" situations handled with too little real poignancy. I also couldn't understand why two SSGs like Astor and Rosanelle had been tolerated for 30 years. The episode of Astor meeting Cal (or whomever) after hours was never really addressed to resolution. Maybe I was looking forward to this book too much - sort of like a Christmas that can never meet the expectations. I found it to be average and I expect more of Cassandra King."
4,The Same Sweet Girls-Delightful book,"I really enjoyed this book. I think it appeals more to southerners, however. The novel chronicles a group of young college friends who have continued their friendship for many years (in twice a year weekend visits)until they are now in their 50's. Three of the women are developed significantly more than the others. The ladies have very complex relationships amongst themselves. The book will make you laugh through your tears. Highly recommend the book."
4,Same Sweet Girls,"I found the book to be a delightful read. The characters are very well developed and make the pages come to life. It is a book that will make you laugh and cry. I also enjoyed her other book, The Sunday Wife."
1,Not her best!,I loved the Sunday Wife. The book had a great concept however we were lead into little clues along the way of different relationships and twists and turns...and yet nothing went further. The focus ended up on the one SSG who got cancer and died. The end left me very empty.
2,Not my taste,"If you like the ""women make a mess of their lives but survive it anyway"" type of book, you might like this. Personally, I'm tired of that same old sad song of women choosing to let themselves become whiney victim love songs."
4,Long-time Friendships,"The book was fun to read, but I was frustrated because the characters were often acting the way their families or the culture expected them to act and they were not communicating their true inner feelings. They relied a lot on their good friends inferring what they were thinking or what they needed. Maybe my problem is that I was born north of the Mason-Dixon Line. It was still a good read, even though I am pretty sure these ""same sweet girls"" would never have included me in their group!"
3,SSG''s,"I wanted this to be a great read, but it wasn't. I kept having to go back and refresh my memory of all of the characters. There is a lot of nothing going on for me. I gave it 3 stars because I got it off the bargain table, so it was worth that."
3,Great Characters,"I enjoyed this book because the characters were so interesting and the story kept me turning pages to see what happened next. I really hated that the narration alternated between 3 of the six main characters. It wasn't quite as confusing by the middle of the book, but at the beginning they all sounded alike and it was hard to keep them straight. I wouldn't call this great literature by any means, and I don't think it paints any great picture of friendship. (Personally I wouldn't want to be a part of a group where the ""friends"" openly admit that they don't like each other and tolerate one of the group who sleeps with the others' husbands) The characters' flaws are what makes them interesting. It's a great story with very memorable characters--an enjoyable read."
4,Brutally honest with welcomed comic relief,"I am a foster mother, bio mom of two and adoptive mother of one, and I really enjoyed this book. It is a quick read and offers the truth about the range of emotions before,during, and after adoption. It gives a voice to all those unspoken things adoptive and even nonadoptive parents feel and think but could never publicly say. I really appreciated the authors honesty and her sense of humor which you really need to be part of the nontraditional life and extended family we create when we adopt. You won't regret buying and sharing this book with your family and friends. They too will benefit from knowing that you understand that, at times, you're perceived as crazy and that there are answers to some of their questions too."
3,A mixed bag,"I am glad I bought this book and had the opportunity to read it. Ms. Wolff has expereinced a totally different type of adoption, and for different reasons, than I am about to expereince. There were parts that made me laugh and parts that worried me. Wolff is honest in her fears, her opinions, and her acknoledgement of her losses, but the book does come across as being a little ""selfish"". I think that's because the focus of this book, unlike most adoption books is on the MOTHER, not on the child.An accurate portrayal of one woman's experience that may not necessarily be an experience all readers can or will identify with."
3,Not as good as expected,"I was expecting a lot more from this book. As a white woman with one bio child considering adopting an Asian child, the reviews and reader comments made me feel that it would be just the antidote to all those adoption websites that make you feel so inadequate if you are having any doubts. I guess I don't feel that her ""secrets"" were really all that alarming; I would guess that most people who have adopted or are considering adopting would cop to experiencing at least some of the things she has. That said, those readers in other reviews who WERE so offended are perhaps the noisy minority that contribute to making the rest of us feel guilty if we have politically incorrect thoughts. I think there are two kinds of people who adopt: those who want to help a child with special needs or that no one else wants, and those who-like every pregnant woman-prays that her child will be healthy, normal, and in some way ""like"" her. I think both groups should respect the other."
5,Must-Read,"This book is a must-read for people planning to adopt, and those who have adopted and are still adjusting. There are a lot of feelings and fears that most people won't talk about during the adoption process, but they are there and they are real, and this author explores them."
2,Did you really say this?,"I have read the ""birthmother"" letter in your book. What a demeaning piece of prose! I was separated from my mother for over 34 years by adoption and when I found her, she had as many regrets about the process as I did. She would have had more, I'm sure, if she knew I'd been raised by a woman like Ms. Wolff. I hope that the wonderful woman who adopted me had no thoughts like these. Remember Ms. Wolff, you're raising another woman's child!"
1,"Can I Buy a Baby, and Can I Send It Back?","In her book, Jana Wolff objectifies the child and dismisses the child's mother as so much garbage. In truth, birth mothers enter into relinquishment sorrowfully and loving their children, and in doing so, they embark on a lifelong journey of pain: missing the child and loving the child and knowing they made a wrong decision in their youth. Jana Wolff's treatment of birth mothers is as they are simply a means of deliverance only (that is her word, deliverance). Wolff also devours and spits up the traditional adoptive family mythology, to be sure, openly discussing that cost indicates buying a baby, and wondering if she can send it back after purchase.Other adoptive parents have lauded this book. I say, if Wolff's representation of how adoptive parents think is reality, a hard look at adoption, motives of adoptive parents, and the welfare of the child vis-a-vis adoption is sorely needed.Thumbs-down on the thinking that is presented throughout this book."
5,Gift for my brother,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my brother. He has visited Ireland once and is crazy about Ireland and wishes to return, maybe even take our parents. He said the book came in great condition and was beautiful. I would write more but I have not seen it myself. Maybe I will write more after I visit him and see it."
4,Magnatiles,My 4-yr. old grandson was thrilled when he got these for Christmas! He seems to enjoy playing with them and the product allows for a lot of creativity.
5,magna tiles,These magnetic tiles are great for kids. It gives them something new and different to play with. And they can be used in many ways to build different objects with their many shapes. The kids will be using them for a long time. Our grand kids love them.
2,Not What We Expected,"Friends recently introduced us to these tiles and their children seemed to love them. The ones they had were the 'clear"" kind and the ones shipped were solid in color. Honestly, the magnetics used in them are quite poor and we have been quite disappointed with the product in general."
4,Great tiles but mom needs ideas,I think these tiles are great. My 3 year old and I build stuff together and he can stay occupied for hours with it. Only thing is I need more ideas on what else to make...
5,Inspires creativity,"My boys (3) and (5) have Magna-tiles in their preschool and pre-K classrooms, and their teachers told me that they play with them all of the time, so I decided to buy a set to have at home. The tiles are durable and fully magnetic, and are magnetically attracted to all parts of the other Magna-tiles. My sons use the Magna-tiles to build different creations and create hiding places for some of their smaller toys (home for Squinkies, garage for Hot Wheels cars, etc). Definitely worth the price."
4,Be Careful On The Pricing.,"This book uses ""unit pricing"" or ""flat rate pricing,"" a helpful way to estimate a project when you are sure the pricing reflects your material and labor costs plus the correct markup for your business. You should take a sample case and compare your actual costs to a listed unit price. You can then adjust (increase or decrease) the listed prices to reflect your situation. I suggest you use the prices as a guide to a pricing system that is best for your type of business. New home building costs less than remodeling and repair. Any unit price process has to take into account the demands of the project. Many home builders have gone broke pricing a remodel project using the same cost process as they did on a new home."
5,JJ's Review of 'Danny and Life on Bluff Point',"Danny and Life on Bluff Point is an excellent book for young teens. It is the story of a young boy and his family growing up in the late 1800s in Central New York State. It shows how life was very different for people 100 years ago. There was no Nintendo or internet. So, the kids had to use their imagination to amuse themselves. The kids had to do chores on a daily basis to help the family survive, not just to earn an allowance. It told of dangers that just don't exist for today's kids like cougars. However, there were also lessons that pertained to today's kids. Danny had to deal with a bully at school and this book showed that there are other ways to deal with problems other than force. And, of course, this book taught the importance of family life."
4,Wonderful with a caveat,"Delia Smith is simply wonderful but at times her attempts to save the home cook from overwrought techniques can lead to attempted over-management. I prefer not to have to wade through Smith's directives to ""put that pan away now; you don't need it anymore"" etc.At times she contradicts her own charter, calling for, for example, the use of fresh tomatoes in winter - a directive which, the fruit not being in season, is no friend to the cook; the result will be neither flavoursome or cheap. At times Smth's attempts to save the cook from effort are a false economy. Nonetheless, Smith is a wonderful, wonderful, and most giving cook. Her recipes are fabulous and bursting with flavour - at times exquisite, and always, always, unpretentious. As a cook, she is vastly superior to most celebrity chefs, Jamie Oliver included, if not most of all."
3,Good Food but a little bland and not that exciting,"Comfort Food in the title enticed me to try this, plus the raving about her popularity in Britain spreading to our parts as well.Trying several of the recipes, I found them to be somewhat basic, bland (except for the Thai inclusions). I loved the Black Bean Chili with Avocado Salsa. But most of the time if I rummage through this one, I'm reminded of similar recipes juiced up by other cooks. Realize for some this approach might be ideal and this would become a solid favorite."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this camera for my 7 year old niece. She was disappointed because you couldn't see the pictures after you took them and you couldn't delete pictures as you took them. I think this would be best suited for about a 3 or 4 year old that just wants to take pictures. As high tech as kids are today, they expect alot from a digital camera and this one did not deliver."
1,Terrible!,"I just got this camera for my seven year old daughter and it was the biggest waste of money I ever spent. According to the box it came in, it holds between 80 (high res.) and 273 (low res.) pictures but the camera absolutely will not take more than 5 pictures. It keeps coming up with error codes that won't even completely show up and takes blurry lowsy pictures. If a negative amount of stars was possible, I would have chosen that for the rating. This is just awful."
1,Go photo Easy Pix 30,The camera didn't work from the time I got it out of the package. I have already sent it back to the company for my money back.
1,WASTE of money!!!,"This camera looks decent online but don't let that fool you! A mattel toy camera is better quality than this bubble gum machine camera! Was so dissappointed when I opened the case for this camera, returning it was more trouble and $ than it was worth. Buyer Beware!"
1,Why pay $30 for a $7 Camera?,This camera is a low resolution VGA 640 pixel item. (only good for wallet size photos) 5 years ago these went for $30 Today you can get these specs from a $7 key chain or novelty camera. For a little more than $30 you should get at least 1.3 to 2 mega pixels.
1,Terrible DVD,"This DVD is not professional, also I was expecting instructions on how to make arrangements. This DVD spends most of its time on care of fresh flowers and ideas for simple flower bouquets not basic techniques for floral arrangements. I was very disappointed."
3,Less Is More,"Ignore all the negative reviews. The beauty of this DVD is it's simplicity. For the beginner, there are a lot great ideas. Just be open to them. If you ever wondered what to do with those clear rectangular glass vases: Voila! Peter Grotas is a professional. He's a top New York City floral designer. It actually does show how to make a mixed bouquet in one of the segments. I don't even remember any flute playing!?!"
1,Flower Styling for playschoolers,"This dvd is so redundant! They show you how to create virtually the same hand tied bouquet of one flower FIVE times...just different flowers. Or how to float flower heads in a vase, like we need a demo shown several times just because they are using different types of flowers! Cut the rose head off and float it in water. Next demo: Cut the orchid head and float it in water. Next Demo: cut the daisy head and float it in water... Ugh!~ Chances are, if you are interested enough in getting this dvd...you probably are already more advanced than this ""how-to"" expects you to be."
4,"Nice socks, hard to pick size",These socks were bought for our son to go skiing in this year. He is 4 years old and wears a toddler size 10. It was hard for me to figure out what size of these socks to order and I ordered YM. They are way too big for him...he won't fit in them for years. I'm not returning them because they will be great for him to ski in eventually.
5,Hella Wiring Harness,"Great easy kit to install your driving lights. Every wire comes wrapped in velum to protect it and other than drilling a few holes to mount the fuse, relay and running it through the firewall its basically plug and play. I used these and a little bit extra wire to mount my lights on my roof (kit is intended for bumper installs) nice quality rocker switch included and all the hardware needed just add lights."
1,A word to the wise....,The other two reviews of this book are almost certainly by the author -- and his writing style in his published works is no better than on this review board.
2,Water drops in the face after normal hand washing at 4 months,"I love the look of the watch, but although it is supposed to be water resistant, the face fogs up after washing my hands. I've only had it 4 months. It was also very difficult to remove links to fit a smaller wrist."
3,2 toned?,"The 2 toned shown here is not that noticible at all. Also, i had to take the watch to the jeweler for link adjustment for which he charged $20! The Amatron, (which I love) I also ordered was easy to adjust myself with a small set of screwdrivers."
1,Wife hated it.,Bought this for my wife and the heading says it all. She did not like anything about the watch so we wound up returning it.
4,Five year old LOVES The Kids of Catan,"For me The Kids of Catan is by no means as fun as Settlers of Catan, but for my five year old, she absolutely loves it. I do find it much more entertaining than some of the other children games we have bought for her.The small buildings and the gathering of the resources has kept her interest and imagination going. We will see what happens after a few months with this interest, but she wants to play this game everyday.It does have some limitations to the levels of the game that can be played, but it seems to be a good buy for now.Very worth getting for your younger children"
2,Kids of Catan,I was a little disappointed in the game because it has no strategy. My 7 and 5 year old can play it by themselves which is nice but I was hoping for a game that we could enjoy as a family.
2,Gnosticism attacks another Tradition,"As the liturgical experimentations of the 60's begin to fade away, it should be of no surprise that the New Age element within the Church has targeted traditional forms as vehicles for their Gnosticism. With phrases like, ""A sacred text is one which is capable of evolving into higher forms within the mind"", ""...the meaning [of scripture]...is symbolic and multiple - there is wide latitude and freedom in understanding them"", and ""powerful Spirit of Wisdom...as female"", it should be apparent where the author is deriving his inspiration. St. Irenaeus, way back in the beginning, warned of the Gnostic's ability to reinterpret everything in terms of itself. This is just another one, although some of the musical bits are worthwhile."
3,Not a photo book about sea creatures,"Not a book about underwater creatures. I know they sell this bundled with 'The Deep', but this is a very different book than the cover would have you believe. I would say half of the book is text, birds, flowers, grasses, etc. Just a heads up."
3,Not that good,"Like most people I purchased this book to use as a coffee table book. Although this book does have some nice images in it. It does not have the wow factor that you would normally expect from a good coffee table book. I would suggest purchasing Ocean by Robert Dinwiddie. (ISBN 0756622050). That book is 1000 times better (in content, pictures, and volume of material), and will keep you entertained much longer."
4,Taste of West Texas,"My book club chose the subject of ""Texas writers writing about Texas"". Passing up McMurtry and Graves, et al, I chose this book. The essays and short stories really are about living in West Texas - not just novels set in Texas. Reading about the authors, I was impressed with their credentials. Some of the pieces are so West Texas you can feel the everlasting wind and taste the dust and know that they love where they live. Of course, not all the pieces are of equal value, but I recommend the book to anyone interested in women writers - and West Texas."
5,Inspiration for kids and their parents .,"As a parent of 2 children who are involved in competitive sports, I cannot say enough about this book. There are times that even parents get invested in the score and forget the process. I would be lying if I said I do not want my kids to win every competition, but Coach Wooden, with the help of Ms. Harper and Mr. Jamison ,reminds us all of what is important and helps keep us grounded. My son is on a Crew team and my daughter ice skates individually and on a synchronized team. I cannot recount how many times I have quoted Coach Wooden's philosophy this past year stressing team work, responsibility and pride in doing your personal best. In a culture that teaches win, win, win, [ especially in light of new allegations in sports everyday concerning steroid and other drug use] this book is a refreshing breath of air."
5,Kim's review,Great transaction. The product was just what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner. I would definitely order from this vendor again.
2,Not much Banjo on the CDs,"I was very disappointed to see page after page say ""Banjo not on CD."" True, the CDs alone are good, and help to lessen the blow of spending thirty bucks on a ""banjo"" book that doesn't actually have that much banjo in it. But if I wanted to buy Bluegrass CDs, I can find them elsewhere. I thought I was getting 50 BANJO songs. Instead, I have to search through the songs to find the few that actually have the banjo in it.The other songs are good and all, and may be helpful to somebody who is already really good at the banjo and can improvise, but I need to hear the tune I'm playing in order to learn it.The bottom line is that I was led to believe that I would be getting 3 CDs worth of songs with Banjo in them, and the tablature to play along... and I didn't get that."
3,Kline is famous but not the best,"The production is well organized and well filmed and generally well acted, but I find Kline's Hamlet slow & indulgent, technically tearful but ultimately unconnected. Get your hands on Derek Jacobi's for some real excitement."
5,Love This Show,"I like the actors,it's about vampires,I really like how Elena kicks butt. I'm looking forward to Damian and Elena getting together."
5,The Vampire Diaries are back Season 4,I waited soo long for this to be back again!!! It got a little crazy - but was not excpecting all that happened!!! Can't wait for 2nd one!!!
3,Not as good,"Its just not as good as Season 3. Hopefully it will get better. Of course I liked the episodes when all the ""original"" vampires were involved. Im looking forward to Caroline hooking up with Klaus and Elena finally hooking up with Damon in this season."
3,getting bored,"I used to love this show, but I'm actually getting pretty bored this season. I don't enjoy Elena being a vampire, and the storyline seems like it is trying too hard at this point. I watched the first 3 seasons and loved every minute, but I am not attached to season 4 yet ... I hopefully it gets better."
4,very good,"Besides the fact that i love TVD...the instant video worked just fine. I needed to catch up on one episode and didn't feel like logging into my home computer (which i cld have watched the episode for free online), so i paid for this episode. I was a little disappointed that it had commercials. If I'm paying my money for it the commercials should be omitted. Next time I'll go to my home computer, since i still have to deal with the commercials. But other than that the viewing of it was perfectly fine"
3,Over the Top,"Still the same fascinating characters, with some new additions. The plot was a bit much this season. Good acting from young talent!"
3,review,it was okay because sometimes it stop randomly but was worth it hope the prices go down though that is why i rated it okay.
5,Great way to Catch Up,Enjoyed the show. Can't wait to watch it now on TV. Streaming works great will continue to use it again.
4,Love the show,Love the show however was a little disappointed in the quality - if you have the extra $1 to spend get the HD :)
4,excellent series,no matter what the episode I like this series. This and Leverage seem to be my special favorites. The guidelines for this thing said to put in two more words. I couldn't think of anything else related but...now I am past the two words...so there.
5,Amazing,Season 4 is just amazing. It is interesting to see how Elena's relationship with the Salvatore brothers is changing now that she is a vampire.
5,this is my daughters purchase,"I don't watch the vampire diaries, but my daughter does so I can't give it a true rating. I know it keeps her glued to the tv for hours. She loves to tape them and watch them all at once but for one reason or another some episodes didn't tape. I gave it five stars just for the fact that this is an option if something else goes wrong."
4,4th season so far,I kind of liked the 4th season so far but they need to get to the point instead of it being a guessing game every week.
5,Awesome Show,I've recently watched every season back to back and I absolutely love it. It's a great supernatural show filled with every being possible. The only bad part is that I have to wait week to week now for the new episodes :-(
4,Really good show for all ages.,"My granddaughter and I watch this show together, We watch on Amazon Prime as I cannot abide commercials. I do not watch and commercial TV unless it is streamed and Amazon is great."
5,Still in progress ...,"I was asked to rate the Complete Season 4. Well, how can I do that when it's still on air? I love this show. As with all sci-fi/fantasy shows, some of the story lines are a bit over the top and unbelievable, but the underlying messages are strong and the characters are interesting. Hope I still love it when it's in the can. I own the first three seasons and will likely purchase Season 4 when it is ready."
1,Amazon strikes again..,"Bought and it wouldnt play, no way to get money back. Just a few dollars but hey, it's the point of it. I like to receive what I paid for.."
1,DRM make this purchase useless,"I purchased Season 4 #5 because we missed it. I downloaded it at work because my download speed at home is ridiculous! Then I downloaded & installed the stupid Unbox sofware at home and it wouldn't recognize the downloaded file on my USB drive. I would have to download it again to watch! If I have bought the content, I should be able to watch it on any device I own! I hate DRM and will not buy anymore videos from Amazon until they change their Apple-like practices!"
5,Vampire Diaries Rock,I love all the teenage drama. I'm almost caught up to the new season thanks to Amazon instant download videos.
4,A fun series,"While this series may not be as dark as a person might think a vampire series would be, it is still none the less entertaining and if you start from the beginning of the series it is easy to get caught up in the story line. I do enjoy watching it. I would like to see Damon get over on Klaus that is too say actually over power him and I would also like to see him win over Elaina. I think they make a much better couple than Stefan and Elaina."
5,Still in love,"Despite all the hate folks are showing for TVD lately, it's still a wonderful show. I love all the depth the characters are developing, Elena is becoming less whiney as a vampire, Damon and Klaus are still hot...but I am anxiously awaiting the return of Katherine!"
5,<3,"I love this show! Vampire Diaries is probably one of the only reasons I bother to watch television anymore simply because I love the story line. I hate to compare it to Twilight, but the plot to Vampire Diaries is way stronger and more stable than Twilight's books and movies. I have a major dislike for Twilight, and I was skeptical watching a different vampire themed production, but this series has turned out to be one of my favorites. Love it!"
4,Always a twist,This show is great because there is always a new twist! Great continuation of the series..highly recommended if you like Vampires!
5,It just keeps getting better and better,"The plot keeps renewing itself and keeps getting better.It's like no other vampire series I have ever seen.I like the teen-style angst which fits in nicely with the vampire""I am cursed"" attitude they all have."
4,I am hooked,"I've only watched 7 episodes so far in season 4. So far so good. If you have never seen Vampire Diaries, I suggest you watch seasons 1 - 3 first so you can follow the story line."
5,Love this show,I enjoy all the characters even the bad guys..it just pulls you into their world. I find myself actually feeling like I'm having withdraw syndrome when I haven't watched an episode in a while. What can I say...I just miss the characters. Lol
4,Pleasantly surprised,It's does have it's flaws but season 4 so far has been the best! I found the romance between Stefan an ellana so addicting!
5,Just awesome!!!,"I have high expectations for Season 4 and haven't been disappointed so far. The plot just continues to thicken, the script keeps on getting better, and the actors are just beautiful!!!"
5,Must watch,I love watching The Vampire Diaries I hate waiting a week to see a new epsiode its amazing! It is a must see for vampire fanatics.
4,Frustrated,"I have a question: now that Elena is a vampire, and all of her senses and emotions are heightened to almost unbearable levels - how is she STILL so easily ignoring her feelings for Damon? At this point the writers are just dragging it out to keep the tension going, which is beginning to be annoying.I am enjoying the plot and the majority of the characters immensely, particularly Rebekah and her struggle to be more human/make amends. And the secret sharing between Stefan and Klaus promises to be very bad news/interesting.Elena is starting to annoy me, and I'm in favor of bringing back Katherine - who, having been keeping a close eye on Stefan over the years, surely knows that Elena is now a vampire and will be back to stake her claim and stir up trouble?"
5,I hope there is a fifth season,I love it so far!!!! Im sure many MANY people were rooting for Damon and its finally happening!!!!! Its so different from the last three seasons! I want more!
5,I loved it!,I loved it was! was amazing! I watch it over and over again and never get tired of watching it.
5,"If you like vmapires, you'll enjoy this~","I'm a hugh vampire fan and this has all kinds of twists and turns, present and past. Just an all-round great series."
4,"Don't be fooled, this is NOT Twlight","This show has a lot more in common with Angel and Buffy than Twilight. Is there teen drama/romance? Yes but that is about 2% of the show. The rest is vampires, werewolf's, witches, hunters, and hybrids fighting and killing and learning more about the history and lore behind their respective species.Its pretty good actually."
5,Wonderful episode!,"This is one of the best episodes of this series so far. It's dramatic, exciting, scary, emotional, and a real tear-jerker in the closing minutes. A fantastic start to what promises to be a great season!"
5,Love This Series!!!,I heard this season of Vampire Diaries was going to be fantastic and I haven't been disappointed. There have been so many plot twists and surprises I have looked forward to every episode.
5,Intriguing,From the start draws you in and always something new keeping you on the edge of your seat. Very good story line and the characters fit uniquely.
5,My favorite show,I am so glad that i purchased this season of vampire diaries! It is easy to access except for my phone.
5,i cant get enough of the vampire diaries!,"I love this show! Cant get enough!! Always great twists and turns in every episode. I am finally caught up now and can watch on tv, but it was money well spent! I watched from my computer through an HDMI cable onto my TV. The quality was really good."
5,Love it,Love the Vampire Diaries!! The Salvatore brothers are incredible. So glad my sister in law got me to watching it!
5,worth paying for,"i see it like a red box, you pay for a red box and enjoy the movie welll just like a red box ill pay to watch this show a couple bucks is nothing! i really enjoy the suspense and action in this show and will continue to watch it as long as it is on amazon."
5,vampire diaries,The season keeps getting better and better. You never know what to expect. I did miss Klaus in the latest episode
1,rip off,Warning- this article is only about 2 paragraphs long and gives no new information about Misrach whatsoever. Do not buy!
1,Not worth the effort,"I bought these tights from a store for my daughter last week. They ran the day she put them on, and she wasn't being rough on them. We washed them anyway, so she could practice with them as we got cheaper tights. This morning she put them on and both feet had runs everywhere (the original run was at the top of her leg, so did not cause this mess). I washed them according to instructions on the package, and they ran anyway.Save you money and frustration, but cheaper convertible tights. After all, they are tights, and tights will run. They just shouldn't run on a first AND a second wear."
4,GHOSTS OF TARGETS PAST - LOVES & LOSSES,"I obtained THE GHOSTS OF TARGETS PAST at a Toronto Military show in 2006. I got a chance to meet the author, Philip Gray - what a treat! The author and the book are living history of the part a Canadian bomber crew played in World War 2. The book is truly an enjoyable read. The chapters and antcidotes were so tastefully done and the romance gently moving. I was wishing they would make this story into a Hollywood movie by the time I finished. It was a wonderful glimse into the life of a bomber crew and the stresses and dangers of the air war. I will always treasure Philip Gray's novel. This is the stuff heros are made of - ordinary men doing extraordinary things and securing the freedoms we enjoy to this very day. THE GHOSTS OF TARGETS PAST is the real tale of loves and losses. The reality of fearing for one's life and the joy of discovering it again after every mission. The cause was great - the price was high - THE GHOSTS OF TARGETS PAST tells it all. Enjoy!"
1,Don't Read this Book!,"In this book, Daughter of the Sea, the book was not interesting at all, and I would give it no stars if the computer would have went that low. It's pretty much about a woman named Janice, and her husband, Munroe, that find a baby and keep it as thier own and hope that no one finds out about it.They live on a ship that they also make thier living off of fishing and selling the fish they catch. This book is very fictional, since there is no way you could find a living baby on the shore, and expect to keep it. And there is no way to make a good living selling fish. This book was not one of my favorites. Taking into consideration I don't have any favorites, and I don't care for a subject about people living on a ship and keeping a baby. There is no way this book should have gotton a overall rating of four stars, but the no stars has my vote."
4,A great Selkie tale,"A great fable based upon many of the Selkie legends from different lands. A childless couple raise as their own a baby girl the husband found one night floating in the sea during a storm. Munroe suspects right away that this child is one of the Selkies (seal-people) but keeps the secret from his wife Jannet. But when a mysterious stranger returns years later asking for the return of his child, the desperate woman tries to hide the child - and brings upon her village the anger of the sea and the seal people. Finally their daughter must chose for herself whether to return to the sea, or stay with the people she has grown to love as her parents. A great addition to lovers of tales of the Selkie."
1,"Too thin, Too Underdeveloped, Too short","What can you write about in 128 pages that will become meaningful and make sense with the whole idea with the story? Nothing. I must say the summary was intriguing, but it was too short and underdeveloped to have any meaning. This is not one to stick in your memory.Read another book, any other book. Like ""Crown Duel"" or ""Alanna: the first adventure""."
1,Don't Read this Book!,"In this book, Daughter of the Sea, a woman by the name of Janice. She has a husband named Munroe and a kid (baby) they found and took for thier own. They have thier own fishing boat which they make a living off of. The plot of the story is they find this baby, but it's not thiers and they know someone will find out and take her away from them, such as thier real parents. My opinion about this book is I didn't really like it since it was not action - filled to keep me reading the book. The rating, I would give it is the lowest rating I could. I didn't really understand the book. The content of the book is very fictional, since it is about how they find a baby, still alive, live on a boat, and selling fish. I don't like books anyway, and this was not my favorite. I don't really like subjects about people trying to hide babies and living on a boat and selling fish as a living. In conclusion, the book was no good, and I would give it a no star."
2,Comprehensive but boring,"This is a very comprehensive textbook of the subject. It deals with just about every aspect of the AIS realm. It is, however, a very dull book. There isn't much illustrating, no color, and absolutely no life beyond the black and white wasteland of its pages."
1,Boring and the captain obvious of textbooks,"There are so many more physically painful things I'd rather do than read this book. AIS is naturally boring...that's a given, but it takes it to a whole new level of boring. It could give you the no-nonsense technical and professional information, but it goes on and on where no comment is necessary. Sometimes saying things that a first grader would know. Don't buy this book if you can avoid it, and if you're a professor...please don't subject your students to this."
2,Only Buy if Required for a Class,"Very boring reading. Chapters tend to repeat themselves. The class I had for this book was one of the most boring classes I ever had. Instructor lectured from power point slides. I could have taken this class homestudy and done just fine, than to sit in class."
2,Repetitive,"Wow, the author needed 832 pages to say the same thing over and over again. Although I didn't find it as boring as the other reviewers, I still did not like it. I didn't really learn anything past the first couple of chapters.There are much better books out there on this subject, so if you don't really need it for a class, go and buy something else. Especially if you're comfortable with auditing."
2,The most boring accounting book,"Definitely agree with other people here, this book is extremely boring. I bought it for one of my classes, the class was OK though."
1,Sucks,"Boring book, you will always look to see how many pages are left before you complete the chapter. If you ask me with 100% hands down certainty the guys who wrote this book haven't been laid in over 6 yrs"
4,Great toy!!,My son loves these. He makes me dry them off so he can play with them out of the bathtub also. I really like that these toys don't have the usual drain holes. I don't have to spend the next 10 minutes draining all of the bath toys.
4,Bumbly yummy!,"Bumble Bars Bumble Bar Original W/Cashew Box Of 15 1.6 ozDelicious! Love the Gluten-free aspect, taste is not too sweet, crunchy munchy satisfying. I was a big Wa-guru fan, but these are not as sticky. Chocolate Cherry is not for wimps, but the others (esp. with nuts)are great!"
5,"Sabrina, The Teenage Witch","Sabrina Spellman lives with her Aunt Hilda and Zelda, but on her 16th birthday, they tell her the secret of her life...she's a witch! Sabrina's spellbook has a magical picture of her father that can talk to her! But one problem, Sabrina can't control her powers! Will Sabrina ever learn to be the witch that she really is?"
4,I thought the book was very interesting and imaginative.,"To start with Sabrina is told by her aunts [Hilda and Zelda] that she is a witch! Surley not, Sabrina thinks that they are just playing a trick on her so packs her bags ready for school. within one lesson Sabrina has already made friends and enemies. Theres Harvey who she has not realy spoken to yet becouse Libby quickly snatched him away, and Jenny who was the new girl last year. Sabrina finally believes that she is a witch when she wishes dead frogs back to life in Biology and it happens!!! Sabrina faces many chalengies through the book ,which make it interesting but parts of it , like the Rudy Kazootie episode got a bit boring. I liked the book and would recomend it to people aged nine to fourteen ."
5,"Sabrina gets a man dough date, She turns a baby into a man.","I really loved the book, it was awesome!!!!! I loved the man dough part! I also liked when Sabrina babysits the little boy and turns him into a full grown man!!!! I also found the start very interesting when Sabrina finds out she's a witch and her cat, Salem, talks!!!!! I have to give it to ya author(s), you really caught my eye on that book!!!!!!!!! Thanx for the great interest and keep writing!!Karli McKinnon age 10"
4,This book was of the best of its series.,I thought Sabrina #1 was one of the best ones out of its series. Its about Sabrina discovering that she is a real witch and all the trouble she gets into when she first discovers the truth. I think that every one should read this book or they won't know what there missing.
4,Sabrina is just finding out that she is a witch!,I loved this book! Hilda and Zelda have to tell Sabrina that she is a witch! (And she does not beleve them at first!) Then she starts doing magic when she does not really want to. Very funny. It's good.
5,Very inovative tape measure,I recieved my tape measures today and I must say im quite impressed alot of thought went into these. The easy belt clip is awsome and it will be alot easier on my pocket cause lets face it as many times as I pull the tape on and off to take a measurement a little thing like that goes along way. The pencil sharpener is something else.As a trim carpenter I need a sharp pencil and to carry a sharpener in my pocket or us ea mechanical pencil all the time just isnt practical so they have made good use of what is normally dead space on a tape measure.The note pad speaks for itself Im always looking for something to write on so I dont get the opertunity to forget my measurements on the way back to the saw. The dual locks are great too if you purchase this you will see what I mean. Now since these a brand new im going to update my review after I see how long they last me. I usually only get about 6 months out of a tape so we will see
2,Poor quality,I reviewed this with the Square N Tape combo. Poor quality.More words More words More words More words More words
5,Great tape measure!,"These are great for finish carpentry. I've had one in my tool bag for a few years now, use it every day and it's till going strong. I love the writable pad on the side, it's extremely handy for trim work and framing. I'd recommend a fat max or other brand if you're looking for a 30' or bigger, they have better stand out and are easier to read at a distance."
1,Amazon Did A Very Poor Job In Advertising This Product,"I know that this CD set is great, that is why I ordered it. I however got an e-mail after I had already ordered the item that I found on the website saying they refunded my money because the price was wrong and the ""quality of the item wasn't good."" What sort of bad advertising is that? It isn't my fault that they priced it wrong, and if there was a mistake I should have received it anyway. It isn't fair, and I want everyone to know that they obviously did not do their jobs in making sure all of the information was correct to be displayed on the website."
4,Of Halloweens long ago....,This book is a great look back at some vintage Halloween costumes. They range from late 1800s to early 1980s with more focus being on the pre-1960s eras. The reason is that the photographer collects vintage Halloween costumes from around the country. Creating both a collection and a history of Halloween in America.The photography is very well done and the photographer even talks about the methods used which is a very interesting way to make the photos unique and almost come alive.A must see for Halloween devotees interested in costume styles from yesteryear.
5,A great book,"After finishing Book 1 I was very eager to read the next one, and have not been disappointed in it. This is a great series."
5,Great story,I have really enjoyed the Songs of Acadia Series. I started this series because I had just finished the Love Comes softly and the Tender years series and wanted to try another book by the same author. I was not disappointed. I did not realize it was a series when I started the first book and had to read all five. I like how the author incorporated history from the era without it reading like history. I plan to continue reading this author.
5,Faitfhul in all their live,"God has given them permission to be reunited as a family after such a tragic separation. How the children Nicole and Anne have found the Lord in such a troubled time. As well, the reuniting of the brothers Andrew and Charles is touching and makes the book even more worth to read."
4,A Great Continuation,"Andrew and Catherine settled in the land of Acadia after Andrew became a preacher. They had told their young daughter, Anne, of the circumstances surrounding her childhood. So Anne grew of knowing about her birth parents being out there somewhere.Louise and Henri who are now settled in Louisiana haven't forgotten their friends from Acadia. They waited until her daughter, Nicole, was older before they told her about her other parents. Nicole's uncle decides to head north to Acadia and Nicole must resolve something before she is to follow him.Charles Harrow, Andrew's brother comes to Acadia looking for his brother and niece. But there is more than you think behind his reasons for coming to Acadia. Will he deceive his family or himself?This book is a wonderful continuation to the Song of Acadia series. These two do a wonderful job writing the series. If you like this book be sure to read the next one."
2,Lousy picture quality!!,"Why is the video quality of so many Bollywood movies so poor? Does the industry as a whole not care about the way it's represented on disc? The video quality of the DVD version of Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke I purchased resembles a poor VHS copy. In fact, rather than watch the movie to the end, I've already ordered another vendor's version from eBay, in hopes it'll be a cleaner copy from a different mastering. Am I going to return the copy I purchased through Amazon? No - it's no fault of the vendor's that the video is of low quality. They delivered the goods as advertised. From my experience, it's very much ""buyer beware"" when purchasing a DVD of a Bollywood movie made more than a couple of years ago. Calling it a ""crapshoot"" would insult the dice."
1,Review of Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke,"I was not impressed. The subtitles are non-existent, and when I informed the seller of this problem, they did not seem concerned at all...The movie itself was of mediocre quality.It almost seemed as if it was a copy of a copy."
4,easy to work with,"This wiring kit makes it a breeze to wire the lights, and its quick. But the switch is very big and does not fit it with new vehicle dash and controls, it just looks out of place."
2,Period piece erotic lit just doesn't cut it ...,"The book certainly has all the elements and the author certainly has all the knowledge and skill to make this a wonderfully erotic story, but, I could never really seem to get into it.....Amy, our beautifull and wanton heroine, seems to slip and slide from England to the royal court of France, King Luis whatever, as we see her both at Lancaster Hall to be introduced to society as the new wife of Ralph Fitzroy, and, the object of the kings lecherous desires at the court .....Sorry tried as hard as I could to concentrate on the story of the book .... but ... like I want to read erotica and not get a lesson in disjointed histrionics...."
4,It Works,"I have used this a couple of times before so, when I lost some weight, I decided that I would use it again to help firm up my breast. I really don't use it to make my breast larger but more to firm. The first couple of times I used it, I only took it 3-4 months. This time I will probably use for at least 6 months. It works slowly but, it does work. I'm not real strict to avoid caffeine or carbonated beverages and maybe it would work better if I was more strict. I just usually try to avoid the caffeine and carbonated beverages for about an hour after taking the tablet. After finishing the present course, I'm considering taking it periodically to help maintain the results. For the cost, I think it is worth trying."
3,works but has side effects,The product works really well. I had results immediately but also had a lot of side effects. I'm currently taking the pills every other day and still showing results just more gradual.
1,Biotech natural curves,After a Month of use and no change in size or frimness. Started to get alot of headaches. I felt that it was a waste of money.
5,Two months,At the end of two months my boobs were firmer and more round. Unfortunately I switched to a more expensive product and lost everything. I just ordered more.
5,love the seller and the product!,"Quickly delivery! Perfect outcome! I ordered one from GNC.com, and found it really worked. Then I searched it on Amazon and found it is cheaper on Amazon. So I bought one. Same product with lower price. Love it."
3,Not any better than lower cost alternatives,"I bought this to replace the previous memory foam mattress topper I had. I expected the ""4-pound"" density to provide more comfort. I did not notice a difference. If I had a time machine I would go back in time and buy a cheaper alternative. The miniscule quality difference does justify the larger price difference."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this from Amazon at about half the price that it is now listing for, $65.00. When I received the mattress it came wrapped in plastic and was yellowed with age. There were no instructions or a box. I decided to open it and let it relax to see if it was comfortable. I didn't really mind the yellow even thought it seemed pretty aged. The low price was an incentive. I had to return the mattress because it had been rolled up so long that it would not decompress. I left it out for over two days and there were still many severe wrinkles that were fused in place. Maybe it is a nice mattress if it's not so old that it isn't usable, but I did not have that experience."
3,Good sleeping,We were looking for a whole new matress. Saw this item on your site. It was on sale and I tried it and lked the comfort. Put it right on top my old matress.No complaints.Thanks
4,good mattress topper at the right price,"this topper is thick and rich - i needed it to place it in the crib on top of the mattress, for the baby. It is discolored, as other reviewers had said - but does not affect the function. I would buy it again"
3,Consider carefully if the design is right for you,"I have no problem with the quality of the construction of this lens protector but I have found I have had to end up using it for a different purpose than I intendedThe rubber material is quite non compressible so the drawstring at the top cannot close the opening very much. This makes the claim made on the packaging that the pouch protects against dust hard to justify.It also makes it hard to use the pouch as the main carry around protector for your lensesHowever because the thick neoprene is good for impact absorbtion I have ended up using the pouches as an inner pouch inside a larger carry bag with lots of compartments. It helps to stop lenses bumping against each other.So to sum up, useful to me for protecting against shock and scratching and dents inside a bag or case, not so useful as a case to protect against the outside elements because of the lack of ability to seal the pouch opening."
2,Pillow is different,"The pillow sent is different from the pillow pictured. It is a flower pattern that reminds me of a couch out of the 1980s.Beyond that it is a polyfill pillow that is designed similar to other outdoor cushions. I'm sure it would be suitable if a bolster is what you desired. At this point, I would recommend seeking out a more traditional hammock pillow or simply not purchasing a dedicated one at all. This pillow is not worth its price."
1,Not loud enough to get your attention,"I have sold a number of this style timer made by KitchenAid in Pink , Black and White. Almost every buyer complained. All complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room, have a fan on or are listening to the TV or radio. Replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either. If you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the Red, Black, Blue, White or Tangerine ones that are entitled Digital timer with rotating dial - no one has any complaints over this style of KitchenAid timers."
1,Cute but AWFUL,"You cannot hear the timer... it is poorly made and was an absolute waste of money. I love kitchen aid mixers and my kitchen aid dishwasher is the best EVER but, trust me, this timer is AWFUL."
1,It sucks!,This kitchen timer is really cute and I HAD to have it to match every other pink kitchenaid appliance that I own and love. BUT you simply cannot hear it. When the other review said that you couldn't hear it from the other room they were being generous. You literally can't hear it from like 3 feet away unless you REALLY concentrate. So buy it if you just think it's cute - it is. But still you will have to buy a TIMER for your kitchen or you're gonna burn the cookies.
1,BROKEN ON ARRIVAL,"This item looked tremendous, but whe it arrived I pressed the start button, I found that it was broken and looseI dont exactly hate it but, I feel its not built for purpose, Amazon were terriffic, I sent them my complaint, and my money was refunded instantly, but thats really was not what I wanted, so I have ordered a new one, just adifferent model, & just little more expensive, but really who cares, when we get what we want. AMAZON are just terriffic, dont go anywhere elseEileen CrawfordKitchenAid Cook For The Cure Digital Timer, Pink"
3,"Decent, but stiff and darker than pictured","I ordered this leather bomber for my hubby. He says it fits great. It smelled of real leather, not the junk you can sometimes get. It was a lot darker in color than pictured and didn't look distressed at all (and was a bit stiff), but my hubby was willing to make do. It seems like a sturdy jacket, and we loved the leather smell."
1,Nothing like the picture.,"The jacket arrived in about 10 days. As soon as I opened the box I knew I had made a mistake. The actual jacket is nothing like the picture. Nothing distressed about the leather. Not at all natural. This is a tan coat with a pebble finish. I ordered it in the large size which is correct for me. The shoulders,chest and sleeve length is a perfect fit. The waist is another story. Rather then a nice snug fit it hangs like a curtain. I gave it 1 star because it only cost me $21 and change to return it."
3,Cute but broken snap,Love my Wild Cats and was very excited to put this on my son but when I opened the neck snaps the top one was broken and the sharp part could have scraped him. So sad. So now I have to pay to have it fixed. GRRRRR
2,Skip it,First off let me save you some money. I wish someone would have told me this. This DVD and the How to make a Haunted House DVD are the same DVD. The only difference is the title. I bought both thinking I was getting 2 different DVDs.Now about the DVD. It is not all bad. But it is very very basic. If you have no idea what you are doing this may help you. But if you have ever done a haunted house before then this will be too basic for you.Skip it and the other one.A much better buy is Xtreme Haunted Home Make-Over. This is a good buy and cheap.
4,esential for aspiring haunted house makers,along with the projects in on this dvd the tip give my the guys are useful for building your own Haunted house4 stars because more project would have been nice and a putting the plains on a web site instead of as still shots would have been preferred.
4,A quick read,I met the author and wanted a refresher on what I heard him say. His book is right to the point with lots of references if you want to further research in detail. He has written this book in easy layman's terms with practical applications backed by the references in the back of the book.
4,Wonder drug,"Excellent book that teach us all about this 'wonder drug'.I have been using it for 15 years, and feel great"
4,Good to 1995,"This one sounds almost like a commercial because it is so overwhelmingly positive. Sounds too good to be true. Where are the downsides to melatonin? If this is the whole story, wow!The audio version was adapted from the 1995 book, so does not include any advances made since then. It is good as far as it goes, and calls for more research. It is clear and understandable, not too technical.Side one recounts melatonin's history and the discoveries of its various properties: soporific, anti-oxidant, immune-supporting, etc. Side two gets into its use against AIDS, cancer, heart disease, and insomnia. Side three discusses ""the body clock,"" circadian rhythms, jet lag, shift work. Side four discusses light therapy and melatonin supplementation.Recommended, but supplement with later findings."
3,Good price but a bit flimsy with heavy gauge wire,"The Reese Towpower 7 way trailer connector arrived on time as promised by Amazon. Under normal applications using light gauge wire for trailer lighting, this connector should work fine if propper strain relief is provided. My particular application required the use of 10 gauge wire to provide access to the 40 amp aux battery circuit on my pickup. The thin connector tabs bent when tightening down on the heavy gauge wire and easily pulled out. I had to remove the tabs and use crimp on connectors to get a sound connection. The use of a BRASS washer between the screw and connector plate would also improve holding strength. For the money, the connector is ok but beware if using heavy gauge wire."
2,somewhat false advertising?,"i had been really excited to get this turban for summer holiday use, but when it arrived today i was more than a little disappointed.the only thing i can honestly say in its defense is, yes, this is a turban. other than that, there are no similarities.the color is nothing like the photo. mine is a super light crayola ""flesh"" tone color. not beige, not khaki, just a super light ivory color. strike one.the style looks nearly nothing like the image. the image looks great and i was looking forward to having it as such. instead i got something that looks pretty cheap. granted it is only $10, but still, this looks fairly cheap. strike two.given i had to pay shipping on these, it's just not worth it to send them back. i'm going to look into how to either tie my own, or find another vendor.oh, also, it is VERY polyester and is a little large. the white one i bought in another style is no better. so even after all that, they don't fit well. strike three.darn."
3,Lovely bookcase - cramped shelves,"This beautiful bookcase does indeed have 5 shelves, but used as such will not permit at least half of my books to stand upright. I am not speaking of oversized volumes, but of many current fiction books. So, I have a choice ... rearrange the shelving and convert it to a 4 shelf bookcase, or shelve many books horizontally."
3,beautiful but not very practical and hard to assemble,"It is beautiful, but I found it hard to assemble and the quality of the screws for assembling is very poor: they can easily break.Although it is a five-shelf bookcase, its actual size is like the size of a four-shelf bookcase. If you do want to use all of the five shelves, your books have to be small."
2,These Cowboys Drag Cattle,"What is it about tortured artists when they become happy? Can't they make a good album? So RLJ gets married, has a kid, and releases an album of abnormally syrupy tunes. The trobule is listening to ""Love Will Bring Us Back Alive"" is not half as uplifting as ""Chuck E.'s In Love."" She loses her humor, her poetry, and her ambition all in one shot. ""Atlas's marker"" and ""Ghost Train"" are weird enough to like, but the rest of the album is MOR boredom. She redeems herself in later ventures like Pop Pop."
2,Beautiful Music,"This is a wonderful CD, brilliantly produced, with some of the best studio musicians in the world. The sheer musicality of the vocals and harmonies coupled with the musical genius leads to a truly incredible experience. A truly romantic piece, perfect for a night alone with the one you love. RLJ's poetic, deep lyrics only add to the lush sounds on this work of true art. This is RLJ's greatest album, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed her previous or later works. You will not be disappointed."
4,"Hey Mister, can we have our ball back?","How do you pick a favorite Rickie Lee Jones album? Actually, it's not as hard as you might expect. There's really only three candidates: her classic, eponymous debut; her amazing sophmore effort, ""Pirates""; or this, ""Flying Cowboys"", with Rickie at her most Nyroesque. Pick any one, and you'll not be disappointed."
5,Excellent!!,"If you've ever thought of purchasing an album by RLJ, let this be your first. There aren't many musicians that have the power to really get in your head, and Rickie is one of them. Her lyrics are so captivating, and her voice so emotional, that often snippets of her songs will come to me for no apparent reason, her unusual singing style penetrating my thoughts right down to my soul. If you can listen to the song ""Flying Cowboys"" and not be impressed, then apparently we're not on the same wavelength."
5,Great Book,"I really enjoyed this book. If you like cemeteries, this is a good book guide book for this famous place. The pictures are wonderful too."
4,Review from person who know the subject matter,"This is an amazing story, all of this happened when I was 10 years old and I lived 4 doors down from Samual Byck, I asked my parents if they knew about this story and they had no idea. All they knew is that he did something against the government and was killed in the process. After viewing the story I can state that this was Samual Byck and an amazing part of US history"
4,These are for football...,"I ordered these because I needed some for martial arts, when I got them the package say football. Other than that , they seem fine."
3,I get something different from what I order,"I have been ordering this gloves, for some time now,but the last time, I get two different boxes, that I usually get, and different, from the picin Amazon,I am guessing, it will work, I still dont open it to see the quality, but I dont understand why them send mesomething different, from what I order, still gloves but different brand, and not all are the same quality,maybe this one is better, I dont know, but I am willing to get what I order.Thanks."
1,The Pits!!,These are by far the worst. I have not been able to get one glove on without tearing. Some tear pulling them out of the box.
5,durable latex plastic gloves,"I used these to do dental hygiene in a very hot climate, in Haiti, and they came on any off nicely despite 80 degrees heat. I had no breakage issues at all!"
4,Gloves,Good gloves. Easy to take off and on. Rarely tear. They also don't irritate my hands. I have sensitive skin.
5,Latex gloves,I am very satisfied with this product. It is exactly what I wanted and expected. The price was also to my satisfaction.
3,Protecting Hands,"Its not fair for me to rate this product because I ordered the wrong thing. I was interested in the powdered kind which I usually use. I will probably have to reorder the correct ones. However, I will make a comment on the huge variety and variations that probably caused my error in the first place. Either that or I just wasn't paying attention."
5,Great gloves,"These gloves are perfect for me. I'm not allergic to latex, so I decided to try them after always having to wear gloves that didn't fit correctly. I bought these Medium ones for my housekeeper, and the Small size for me. They're wonderful...fit like a glove without any gaps at all. I wear a size 6 1/2, or small, in a ladies leather glove if that helps you decided what size to pick."
1,"flimsy, too short, and with a chemical stench that sinks into your skin","This is the first time I wish I could give negative stars to a product bought through Amazon.The worst part isn't that these gloves are ridiculously fragile; nor that they're so short they don't come close to covering my wrists. It's the smell I can't get over.The smell doesn't hit all at once, but after a few minutes it's nauseating. That's bad enough, but then a chemical stench lingers despite thorough, repeated scrubbings with hot soapy water. It isn't the smell of an OR or a hospital, if anybody's wondering. Think factory run-off.It actually makes me wonder if there's a health hazard involved here (and I don't scare easily about that kind of thing)."
5,Perfect for around the house tasks,Exactly as described. These gloves are great for dirty tasks or handling substances that are hard to remove from fingers.Great for smaller hands.
5,Great Buy!,"I have tried many disposable gloves and have to say these are the best! I use these for everything including food prep. The gloves are thick and fit perfectly. I ordered a size medium and perfect fit. I am a medium sized person with small to medium sized hands. I would recommend Safetouch Powder Free Latex Exam Gloves, Non-Sterile, Medium. I would definitely purchase again!"
4,Good,"No issues. Just gloves. A bit on flimsy side and can tear if put on carelessly, but they are low-cost, disposable gloves."
3,Good for the price,"I've bought this dryer four months ago and so far so good. It's not the best that I've ever had, but works well for the price."
5,Its all about the basics..,"Keeping it simple...This hair dryer gets 5 starts by default. It is simply what you'd require from a hair dryer. There are no bells and whistles to highlight. Its small, very lightweight, one step assemble (nozzle to device), and easy to use.1875 Watts always ensures desired results. Its highest setting releases enough heat.I have read that this dryer is overly loud, to which i have to disagree- its not quiet but no more obnoxious than any other at home or salon blow dryer.I bought this item for one reason: It was inexpensive and we needed a second dryer in the house.I use it for one reason: I have several lengths of layers in my hair - i needed this and my roll brush to keep them in check.If you're planning to use this dryer for the simple hair tasks or need something to lay out for guest- then here is your happy solution.Good Luck"
2,This dryer does not seem like it has any power,Even though it is the same wattage it does not seem to have any power. I am sure that it is every dryer
5,"great dryer,great price","I am a retired hairdresser ,for years I have found that Revlon blow dryers just keep going, this one is strong enough to get thick hair the heat is needs for a great blow out.I have my pro blow dryer but with tweenagers always around, having this for them to use at the house is great and nice to have in the guest bath. Very happy with the quality and durabilty."
4,good value,unfortunately the heat and fan speed are together - can't have high speed will medium heat. the heat off button helps.
5,"An amazingly light hairdryer, with plenty of heat","I used this hairdryer in a hotel in Los Angeles. Loved it so much I took down the model number and immediately went to track one down for myself. Of course, found it on Amazon...........what don't they have? Great price, but best of all this hairdryer weighs next to nothing. It only has one slider to control it, low, med, high heat, with low heat producing lower air flow, high heat producing highest air flow power, etc. Most hair dryers have separate air force and heat buttons. I actually like this better because I mostly use high heat, full blast, but to each his own. It does not come with those big diffuser attachments, but does have a great directional attachment to better concentrate the airflow in one spot. Average cold shot button. If you are looking for an inexpensive, no frills, light weight hair dryer, this is a great little one."
2,Burnt out,"This hairdryer worked as advertised for about 10 months.After that point, the fan stopped working and it got really hot and overheated in about a second.We'll see how good the customer service is."
3,almost not quite,"I wanted something basic, relatively inexpensive, reasonably well made, and sturdy that would dry and style my hair quickly. That is almost exactly what I got. My only real issues with the dryer is the flimsy switch and lint trap cover. The switch doesn't click into a new setting crisply. You have to go slowly and gently with the switch control in order to get any setting other than off or the highest heat/fan position. The lint trap cover just pops off and takes some careful fussing around to replace securely. Sometimes even if you think you have it back on correctly it will pop back off a few seconds later."
3,Not bad... not good either,"The title says it all... I was expecting something more, in spite of its power 1875 it is feeble and works, but nothing special. I don't recommend it."
2,Buying a different dryer...,"Maybe I got a bad one or something...? This dryer does not work for me. It's light for its size, which is great. BUT, it takes a really long time to dry my hair and leaves it frizzy, unlike my parents' cheap Conair. Plus, it's very, very loud. I have to hold it further from my head so that it doesn't hurt my ears. I bought this based on the good reviews, but I think there are better dryers in the same price range."
3,It's just okay,"I check out hair dryers very carefully because I want 3 heat and 3 speed settings. The description on this one is misleading by saying ""3 heat/speed"" settings. Maybe I didn't understand the description. Big disappointment. There are 3 speeds...low, medium, high...but you cannot control the heat. To me, the hair dryer doesn't get hot enough. Yes, it will eventually dry your hair, as any amount of air would, but it is not what I wanted. I am keeping it just because it's not worth the hassle to return it. The only real pro that I found with this hair dryer is its weight...it's light. Other than that, it's an average hair dryer. I'll see how long this actually lasts, but my next purchase is back to my other trusty Revlon hair dryer that is a few dollars more and gives me control of both the heat and speed."
3,Does the job,"Shipment is on time just like how it is described.Dryer is little heavy for use, I like compact once."
4,decent hairdryer,"For the price it is pretty good, does the job. It's a simple hair dryer. Lightweight"
3,Not a Mighty Wind,"I usually spend upwards of $50 on a blow dryer but this one had such great reviews, I thought, why not? Well, I guess the less money you spend, the less power there is behind the warm air. Because of the lack of power you are looking at a lengthened dry time, however, I'm sure a light breeze is better for your hair. So if hair health matters to you, then this is a good choice, but if you're like me, a working mom, who always runs late, well I need the job done quickly. Wish it had more power!"
2,It was fine until it just stopped working.,"I bought this on June 20th. It worked well every day between when I receieved it a few days later until yesterday, October 9th. However, on October 10, it simply stopped working. At all.It did not overheat and stop working, it just won't turn on. There are actually a series of instructions on the dryer itself about what to do if it stops working. First, clean out the lint. I did that, but there was barely any lint anyway because, as I mentioned, I've been using this dryer for under 4 months. That didn't work. I also tried resetting it with the buttons. Nope. It just simply doesn't work.Maybe I just have bad luck, that seems entirely possible. It seems like things only break for me when I'm too broke to replace them. I certainly don't want to have to run to Target tonight and buy another hair dryer when I JUST bought one less than four months ago! Things also only ever break when I don't have a lot of time.I'm sad. Money down the proverbial drain."
2,the high heat doesn't work,not recommend this one. it was broken when arrive. This one dries my hair in a really really slow way!!
4,good map,"I have the Long Island version and now this one. Nice big print, only issue is matching the roads when they go off the page."
3,TT/Out: The Insiders,"The story is not a bad one, but the combination of writers can be feeled.Although it doesn have good action scenes, seems to be the events that take place here come in a rush (although expected) and that make the book feel a little, I don't know, hurried.The art is good, but it didn't made me feel the sense of flow between frames. Is not like I felt with Infinite Crisis or Identity Crisis. That took a bit out f the comic.Still, I recommend it if you are following the Teen Titans or Outsiders books. It does lead incredibly well to Infinite Crisis too."
4,A delightful vision,"I really enjoyed this film, not only because of its unique presentation of the beautiful, eerie city of Venice, but also because of Lech Majewski's (he wrote, directed and filmed it) quite sensuous, mischievious, philosophical, and lovely treatment of love and death.Its the story of a lovely, intelligent art historian and her lover, an engineer, who move to Venice in the last year of her life. She has a penchant for the artist Bosch, and the two of them meditate on, learn from, and attempt to physically re-create some of the important scenes from his famous and symbolically bizarre paintings.The music (also created by Majewski) adds a poignant and dreamy touch; the hand-held camera work is later explicated by the director himself in the ""Extras"" on the disc.To me, it was a very accessible 'art' film which never dragged, and, indeed, left me with a peaceful, almost nostalgic afterglow."
3,OK,"I was just looking for something different - not my cup tea, but filled the evening with somthing better than what the local chanels offered"
1,No thanks!,I usually like the unusual but this was just TOO weird. Sorry I couldnt watch more than 10 minutes worth. It just wouldnt get to the point!
3,Book review,"This book is geared towards small households that rely on the microwave for preparing convenient meals. Of course, larger households can also make use of this tome whenever they need to cook in small batches.A six-page first chapter deals with tips and techniques. Here you will find information on microwavable utensils, shopping and storage. The rest of the chapters are about hearty main dishes, minimain dishes, side dishes, and snacks and sweets.One of the positive points of this book is that the ingredients for the recipes are listed in separate columns (for one and two servings) in order to avoid confusing the novice cook. I also find helpful the fact that the charts include information on power level setting, procedure and time although I miss the one regarding nutritional values. The illustrations in full color are a plus too."
5,The Dressage Rider's Survival Guide,I thought this book was a lot of fun to read. Got many laughs out of it. Dressage is so serious most of the time we just need a few laughs now and then. Very fast shipment on this item and I enjoyed reading it.
3,Rabbit Hi-top Sneaker,"Very difficult to put on a toddler's foot. They are cute, but very expensive. I didn't want to bother returning them."
4,CUTE CUTE CUTE!!,"That is about the best word I can describe for these shoes! They are a high quality shoe that is all the rage. I get more compliments on them. The only thing I have to say is that if your child has chunky feet like mine does, they are hard to fit. They are really made for a more narrow foot so unfortunately she won't be able to wear them long."
5,wonderful resource for costumers and reenactors!!,"I purchased this book as a gift for a fellow costumer friend. Now I want a copy for myself! As far as I know, there is no other resource that focuses exclusively on, or even devotes any space to such a comprehensive and detailed representation of period eyewear. The photographs are beautiful, and the details of the specimens are fascinating. I learned things I never knew about glasses before.Now I'm tempted to pick up the other titles in this series, especially the ones on hats and footwear. If you're a costumer or reenactor, this is an excellent (and affordable!) resource to have in your library."
3,Wonderful Photography,"The best thing this book has to offer in this mini book format are the pictures. I own several eyewear books and some of my older ones have disappointing black and white pics with little contrast. This book, Eyewear (as a collection of Fritz Rathschuler, an optician from Genoa but of Austrian origin) is full of beautiful images... just don't expect a history lesson. I found the two essays muddled and under-cited but not unreadable.My verdict: Easily worth the $4-6, but to say this book is the best retrospective on eyewear is laughable. It is one man's exquisite collection.This book focuses HEAVILY on Italian models and opens the short ""Non-European"" section with a failed Chinese pair. Many good looking French models and lorgnettes as well!"
1,Blank CD...,"Heard Clay Aiken sing these songs on the TV. Liked them very much and wanted the CD. Ordered one immediately. Received the CD, tried to play it, would not play. Amazon sent me another one and that also would not play. The player said the CD was blank. Sent both of them back. Amazon was great about this."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I like this young mans voice, but I thought this was a poor to average attempt to revive some timeless classics. Some of the arrangements were over the top, and I didn't hear the tone in is voice that I remembered on his previous tv appearances."
2,Clay Aiken's dvd,"I didn't care for this music. It's not any fault of Clay Aiken; I simply don't enjoy the big band sound, and he did do too much ""warbling"" for lack of a better word. But I bought it out of curiousity."
5,Jem's Battle of the Bands was rockin'!,"I've had this book since I can remember. I remember Jem when it came on tv back in the late 80's, and I was sad to see it go off, but, like all things, it had to come to an end. Now I am a part of the egroups digest TrulyOutrageou! Jem Mailing List, which, actually the CREATOR of Jem, Christy Marx, is also a part of the list, as well as the singing voice for Jem, Britta Philips. I also own both Jem volumes and the Truly Outrageous! Jem movie that is currently OOP! ^_^ I hope whoever gets this book loves it as much as I have. Thanks and, Jem is Truly Outrageous!"
1,False advertizement,"I bought this video solely because Nissa Hall was listed among the ""hip hop groupies"" in it. Nissa was shown in the credits but that was it. She not in the video. This video dosen't even rate ones star because of it. Save your money. This rates a zero"
4,Nice sandals but.....,The foot bed of these sandals are very cushy and comfortable but I have found like another reviewer that the stitching by the toes rubs and makes these uncomfortable to wear let alone for long durations. I am disappointed in this because I was looking for a pair of sandals comfortable enough to wear all day.
1,not what I expected.,"The battery itself wouldn't hold a charge, so I returned it immediately. I WILL say that I received outstanding customer service from Amazon, though. Maybe I just got a bad one..."
4,This book has a lot to offer,"A Louisiana mystery, it has ghosts, a southern mansion, stormy weather, and lots of little surprises. The author's writing style is lovely and elegant."
1,Deadly Boring,"This book is about a boy Johnny Mack Willared who disappers when going biking.Bailey and her friend Amy want to knowwhat really happened to him.So they go out searching keifer's Mountain were he was last seen.After a terrible fall,they findthe grisly dicovery of a skeleton.Is it Jhonny and if so what happened to him? This book dragged and at times it was confusingas the author skip from one subject to another to quickly.Plus the ending was extremely disappionting.Don't waste your money."
1,Not Impress at all!,"Magic Makers are excellent in all their products, yet this DVD is nothing special of what it promises! Keep in mind, the seller is an excellent provider of Magic Tricks!! However, the DVD is drastically over-rated and the moves are actually copied from other reputable magicians with a few exceptions. I would not integrate any of his moves into my close-up card routine. The whole DVD is K"" with an attitude on the performance. He is NOT a Card Magician but a juggler..! Moreover, the card routines are not Extreme, and not what you expect based on how this DVD gets market and sold. In my opinion, dont waste your money as I did!!!"
5,Nothing is Ever as Good as Homage Pie,"A wonderful, insightful, homage to the ol' creature from beyond the stars films of the 50s. Our whole family enjoyed this dvd. The kids liked the humor and the weirdness of it and we parents enjoyed the winks, nod, and humor.The framing and sound editing are extremely well done.The bonus features just add icing on the cake to the feel of the film.Kudos to all involved!"
5,Alien Trespass,A nostalgic and fun flash back to those 'monster sci fi flix' of my childhood. I just loved it...I was not scared just totally entertained and gleefully amused.
3,Cute ... But is that good?,"This film is well acted and beautifully filmed. It is a very nicely done modern look at 50's retro sci-fi. It's cute. Many folks will enjoy it. Here is my problem with this and other ""modern"" re-makes of the 50's sci-fi films: 50's sci-fi films were never trying to be cute. Those old 50s and 60s films were trying to be frightening, controversial, while exploring the edges of science and the imagination ... and be entertaining at the same time. Cute was never in the mix. We look back at them now in the light of today's mind numbing, high budget special effects and find those old films ""cute"" and ""quaint"". Go wateh or re-watch the 1954 UNCUT version of ""The Thing"" ... you'll see what I mean. Still, Alien Trespass is cute, very well done and many folks will have fun watching it."
3,Not really what I was looking for.,"This is a tongue in cheek sci-fi movie. I was looking for a serious thriller, but not so here. I watched it during an airplane ride, so it served its purpose of passing the time, but I wouldn't have selected it if I had something else to choose from."
3,cboyb,"The movie story line was fine, but they spent too much time barfing and trying to gross people out! I probably will not watch it again!"
2,Cheesey Whiz,"Some might think this boring, low budget, supposedly stereotypical of the 1950's, alien-crashes-on-earth film has merit as a spoof, but it isn't sufficiently funny. I would rather watch an old film that was good for it's time, than watch a newer film that isn't good now, and probably wouldn't have impressed me had I seen it during the 1950's."
4,I enjoyed it!,"Please don't take this movie too seriously. It was meant to be a comedy, a 50's style alien sci-fi movie filmed with modern cameras and equipment. If you want some light entertainment you will enjoy this movie. I loved the added touch of a true 50's classic movie playing at the town theater. :)I wish I had that old Chevy truck!"
5,"A Loving Homage, most enjoyable","I am among the biggest fans of bad sci-fi films, and I was pleased to see this film taking itself so (semi-)seriously, a real tribute to the neglected genre. Period detail is perfect, and everyone involved seems to really buy in to the narrative. I won't blab away plot, but I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves the 50's schlock. This really is not a parody, rather a tribute, and is meticulous in its profound love of the genre. DVD extras are quite plentiful, with faux-interviews that are hysterical, and an insightful interview with director, R.W. Goodwin (X-Files). There's over-the-top performances from Eric McCormick and Robert Patrick, and I'd really like to see more of Jenni Baird. She gave a very centered performance, as if nothing could be more serious (and fun). Kick back and enjoy. I liked it a lot. PS~Also references to recent films like ""The Hidden"" and ""Terminator"". What fun!"
4,Great send-up of classic sci-fi!,"Absolutely hilarious send-up of 1950's monster movies. If you ever watched Creature Double Feature as kid, or loved movies like 'The Blob' and 'Them!"" as much as I do, then you'll love this flick as well. It looks great, and I love all the nice little touches (i.e. separate twin beds for the married couple; or how the husband has one foot on the floor when they do sleep together)."
2,"Nostalgia, but that's all...","This flick is an attempt to CASH IN on the ""B"" Sci-fi movies of the 50s and 60s. Fine, but most of the originals are still available on remastered DVDs. So why buy or rent this? Nothing new is brought to the table! Do yourself a favor, get coppies of ""Forbidden Planet"", and the original ""Thing"" a nice big bowl of popcorn and ENJOY. ""Alien Trespass"" serves well as a pay day for has been actors Dan Lauria(Wonder Years) and Robert Patrick(Terminator 2). A homage perhaps to these guys, but nothing else."
4,what a slimey mess,"Not the best, but I must say it held my interest, even though the storyline was a little lame and their use of ideas from other sci fi movies. It's definitely not a total loss....... I'd say it's worth a try!"
3,Was not impressed,It was not what I call a great movie. But it did cost me anything to watch it so what the heck.
4,Excellent and a lot of fun!,"A modern movie in the style of the old 1950s sci-fi movies I grew up on. Tongue-in-cheek all the way, it serves up laughs-a-mighty! Don't expect a serious, scary movie... expect the FUN of an old-time Saturday matinee!"
4,This movie was wholesome - a rarity coming out of Hollywood,"There was virtually no language (a real treat) and the people for the most part, really cared about each other. Yes, it was campy but that was the intent. It was also sweet, tender and fun. It was a pleasure to see men and women treating each other with respect. And again, it was a real pleasure to not have to hear some totally unnecessary expletive (is it ever necessary?!) every two frames."
1,Very Little Information about each subject.,I felt this book did not give enough information about the subjects they were to have special sections for. It gave just enough information on each subject to get many beginers in trouble. I bought the book for the special section on shearing. There was one paragraph and a referance page to see a picture the was not even on that page. This book was deffinatly a disapointment.
2,doesn't stay,"First of all, it says in the directions for this product that it is different from other magnetic supports because of it's round magnets. They are square just like the other ones. The pressure and support was good for a month or so, than I don't know if it stretches or what, but no matter how tight I put it, it falls down right away. This is very frustrating.My opinion is to save your money and just get a regular support. I don't know that the magnets actually did anything. It was the support which only lasted a short while."
2,Low quality paper,"As the previous reviewer said, it was not a continuous roll. The paper is good on practice purpose only, not for displaying."
3,Adequate at best...,"If you are looking for practice music for your students to rehearse with this will do. It is nothing great. The singers are out of time, especially on ""Ya Got Trouble..."" If you have to have the music, this will suffice."
5,"No muss, no fuss",What can you say about a shower drain strainer? It snapped in without issue and stays in place; the fit is snug and tight. The satin nickel finish is nice and matches my Moen hardware and Delta shower head.Pros:Easy installNice finishMatches other fixturesCons:None that I can think of
5,"Great product, happy I found it!","I actually bought this basket for my dad. He loves his Mr. Coffee coffee maker, and he just doesn't want to buy a brand new one. Found this replacement basket and he was so happy. Works just fine, great price, and very prompt delivery!"
3,"Meandering, though I suppose that's the point",If you want to read Sennett's opinions on various artworks and art-forms and how he applies these to his social philosophy this is the book you (and apparently two others) have been waiting for.
4,Great for all ages,"I bought this DVDModern Marvels - The Sears Tower (History Channel)for my 8 year-old nephew, who is taking the little boy fascination with all things construction-related to a whole other level. He has been fascinated with the Willis (fka Sears) Tower ever since he visited the Sky Deck. He LOVED this DVD and has watched it repeatedly since Christmas. It has tons of interesting details about the history and construction of the Tower that I didn't know, even after living in Chicago for many years and working IN the Tower for the past 10 years. My company is thinking about buying a few copies to give as gifts to business visitors. Great product from The History Channel, as expected."
4,Yay Cartoons!,"A nicely animated series, but a little heavy-handed with the religious allegory at times. Based on the book."
4,Real world work,This book is full of real world examples. Which if you're an in-service teacher is really helpful.
1,Is mine the same book??,My elementary school has added ESL students this year and I'm looking for help. I bought this book based on the reviews I had read. This is a DRY DULL textbook with no practical information. Don't waste your money!!
4,excellent quality,"I purchased this shoe online for my wife as it helps her with her balance ans arch support. However, the sizes seem to run very small. In most shoes she wears a 6 1/2 to 7 but in this shoe we had to return the original purchase and reorder a 7 1/2 D. Still she has trouble putting the shoes on. Once on, the shoes are excellent."
5,Brooks Ariel,"This is the shoe that I have looking for, for years. I can wear it without an orthodic, it fits the length of my arch and the width of my foot better than any shoe I have ever worn."
2,TOO SAMLL!!,"The color of this book is good,but the pictures are too small!!I felt very disappointed when I got this book..."
2,Avoid this case,"I like that the case is thin and not bulky, but it has several flaws. First, the belt clip is huge. It's actually thicker than the rest of the case with the phone in it. Second, and more importantly, the elastic that keeps the two halves of the case together pushes on the phone buttons. I recently went to use my phone only to find the battery dead because the screen had been on all night.Overall you need to steer clear of this case. There are better options available."
3,OK But....,Good quality and shape for the razor phones. It was very tight when first used which you have to use both hands to pull the phone out of the pouch. After few months it became very loose that you have to use care not drop the phone specially when spinned upsidedown. go for one with clip on top to prevent phone drop.
5,"magnificent, tour de force, masterly technical analysis","Stevens' treatise carries Fant's classic of 1960 up to date, and to a more linguistic level in describing the essential, basic acoustic features of speech. The mathematics are beyond me but I expect to find answers to any question I have about the acoustics of speech communication for explanations in my own book. J.M. Pickett"
2,Not like the Paul Hardcastle of today,"As a Paul Hardcastle hardcore fan, i did not like this cd much. I'm sure the new Jazzmaster VII will be much better, but they didn't even market it well. Had to find out through searches that it was coming out for February 2013!!"
1,Not so good,"I have to admit I was suckered by the claim of ""perfectly accurate backgrounds."" Maybe they're making a distinction between foreground and background. As an example, the synthesizer prelude and background (foreground?) melody to Gimme, Gimme, Gimme is pretty well known. It's non-existent on this karaoke CD. Other songs are similarly disappointing. Given that they're charging $30, it's hard not to call this a fraud. At the least, it's a big letdown for anyone who wants a simple karaoke CD to sing along with."
1,Still waiting for my refund,I purchased this Item and then had to return it because it was not what I had expected it to be. I sent a message to the vendor and got the return address. The product was shipped back in the original packaging and condition and I have yet to see my refund. I just sent another e-mail last night I hope I get my money back.
4,O2 Bag,"This product is used on a daily basis, to allow me to get out of the house. It performes well and I would buy another when it gets old."
1,Very dissatisfied,"I would not recommend this product. Due the fact,that the write up and product information is not totally correct. Deerso, the seller of this product, after several attempts has yet to return any correspondence that I have tried with them. when contacting World Marketing the distributor they explained to me that The operating pressures stated are not correct. I then had to purchase a second regulator to handle the increased pressure. I then had to pay a second service call charge to have it installed and adjust. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT REPRESENTED VERY WELL. THE SELLER DEERSO HAS NEVER CONTACTED ME AFTER NUMEROUS TRIES, TO BACK UP THEIR PRODUCT. I FEEL THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE BANNED FROM SELLING ANYTHING ON AMAZON."
5,3 Brick Heater,We had a 5 brick lp heater in our RV before it didn't have a thermostate so we were always adjusting the settings. Also it was to much btu's for our space so we either had it on low 1 Brick or med 3 brick high was 5 brick which was too much heat for our space. The new heater is so great. It has 5 settings but so far I use either 2 or 3. It shuts off when it reaches a certain temp. except the pilot. When it gets cooler it restarts. No need to readjust.
2,Amco Rub Away Bar,"This product is really too large for the average woman's hands. I found it very awkward to use because of the size, plus I didn't like the raised letters on the bar either. I bought 4 of these as gifts and returned 3 of them. I would have returned all 4 but the seller does not accept opened items (a little plastic bag, jeesh!), so now I have this huge stainless steel soap bar that is useless to me. I ended up ordering a smaller product(they call it Blomus here on Amazon)and like it far better. Both products work great insofar as removing onion and garlic smells from the hands in the kitchen. It would be fine for a man's hands, but women should steer clear unless you have huge hands."
2,Uggh!,"This got rid of kitchen smells. Unfortunately, it gave my hands a tinny taste/smell (the kind one gets just before passing out). That smell makes this product just to unpleasant for me to use. I'd rather smell like onions!Edited to add: I finally found a product I like. It'sGourmet Kitchen Hand Deodorizer, Wasabi Green Tea, 5-Ounce Tubes. It works wonderfully, and the aroma is divine!"
2,Not good for my experimental use,"I had read many places that stainless steel bars could remove body odor the same way it eliminates garlic odor on your hands. I used this in the shower for about a week, and maybe I'm crazy, but I think my underarm smell got worse. I have not tried it in the kitchen (as that might be kind of gross after using it in my armpits), so I can't speak to its intended use. But if you want it for the shower, I do not recommend. The good news is this was the best price I found, so not a very risky experiment."
4,I guess it works,Honestly it's one of those things you buy and then never use. Or at least we don't.
2,JUST SO-SO,"I AM USING THIS TO HELP UNDER ARM ODOR! I DON'T REALLY NOTICE THAT IT'S IMPROVING. ANYWAY, I WILL KEEP USING AS MAYBE IT TAKES SOME TIME TO WORK IT IN!!!!"
2,"Stainless Steel Shaped ""Bar""","This is a stainless steel ""bar of soap"" that naturally removes the odors from your hands. If you do not have a stainless sink, this bar would be very helpful. If you have a stainless sink, you do not need this bar as you can simply rub your hands against the sink bottom and walls under cold running water and get the same results for free. Excellent gift for someone that has a ceramic or enamelled sink."
1,Not what I was looking for,"I bought the rub away bar for underarm odor because others on the market say it works. It actually made it worse. Thank goodness I didn't pay a fortune for this. Oh well, I guess I'll be taking it out of my shower and placing it in my kitchen so I can use it for garlic odors on my fingers......time will tell......"
1,Did not expect a 'hollow' bar,"I did not expect this would have been a light weight hollow product, somehow my expectation was a solid bar with some weight. Seems too flimsy to last for any period of time. It serves the purpose but I am hesitant to put into use as it just seems to be 'disposable'"
4,Get rid of the stink.,This bar works as advertised. Took the stink right outta my hands. It might just kill the stink all together. Take it from me... It just works.
4,It's almost magic.,I was a sceptic untill I used the soap and now I'm a beliver. It really does work and I'm extremely happy that it does since I love to cook with fish and garlic. This bar gets rid of the odor and that's all that matters.
2,Doesn't really work,"I ordered this item because I cook a lot with garlic and onions and have not found a good way to remove the smell from my hands. After getting this item, I still have not found a way to remove the odor completely. This bar does help reduce the odor but it does not take it away completely. I am disappointed as I expected it to remove not just lessen the smell. Not going to bother to return since it was so inexpensive but will not recommend."
5,Works great!,"My mom advised me about rubbing your hands on staniless steel or using lemon juice when removing odors from your hands after handling stinky foods. Something always bugged me about rubbing my hands in the sink bowl and I didn't always have lemons handy, plus they are messy. This bar is GREAT! I gifted them for christmas this year and they were received very well. I taught people the trick too!"
5,Works great!,This product works great for getting any smell out of your hands by just using it for a little bit. I was more than surprised at its effectiveness.
3,It does take the smell away but...,"Okay so I got this thinking, wow how smart a product that removes the smell of fish and garlic! Then my good friend from Italy came over and laughed at me and asked me why I spent money on a stainless steel bar of soap when I have a stainless steel sink and I could just rub my hands on the apron of the sink and do the same thing because that is what they do in Italy. Not such a new thing...So if you don't have a stainless steel sink then I guess it's kind of worth it because it works a bit but you have to rub a lot."
3,"Novel idea, but hands still smell","I cook a lot and onions and garlic are staples in my daily meals. I thought this would be a nice little gadget to get the smell out of my hands as the science behind it works. No such luck. I'll keep using it though, then rub my hands on the sink to get the rest of the smell out, just like I've always done before."
5,It works!,This is a lot easier than rubbing my hands all over my steel sink whenever I cut onions! Works just as well as the more expensive ones; steel is steel.You can also use it under your arms as a deodorant. Decided to try it for that after my mom got me all paranoid about deodorant sticks causing cancer!
5,Impressive Customer Service and Care,"product arrived as advertised. Very fast shipping. Seller stayed in touch with me when due to bad weather in shipping area, to let me know my order would arrive 1 day later, which was no problem to me, but I was impressed by the Customer Service from this company. Would definately purchase from this Seller again"
4,Why does this work?,"I don't know WHY it works, and when my mom gave it to me I had my doubts...but it really DOES work! I like how it can be thrown into the dishwasher with everything else to be washed and sanitized. Good idea for little $$."
2,"Nothing new, nothing interesting...!","Too many non-remarkable examples and most of them adapted and a little forced to what he's trying to explain.I don't like when the author uses himself in many examples. Should be more humble.With all your respect Mr. Mckain but I got bored reading your book. Nothing interesting, too simple."
5,An interesting introduction to many topics,"Full of quick facts and interesting information on the brain and intelligence. Briefly introduces topics such as geniuses, prodigies, multiple intelligences, the Nun Study, Einstein's Brian, etc. Colorful and varied book design nicely divides the information. Includes an index. Karen Woodworth Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
4,fits fine,"I was looking for something to fit my 745Li, this was twice as expensive as regular filter, but I know why.material is heavy and it never needs replacement. just wash and put back...so great idea and value.Hope it's worth it and never have to deal with this change again..."
3,"Works fine, but......","I put one of the ""screens"" on to shave my beard to its desired length, but now it won't come off. Have to use my old Wahl to trim my moustache. If anyone from Wahl reads this, perhaps you can give me a hint. Otherwise, I'll see if my wife can get it off."
5,Wahl is the best!,"This trimmer works great! If you want a hair/beard trimmer that will last, you have to buy Wahl. Only Wahl trimmers have the powerful motors that don't quit or pull your hair. I dropped my old Wahl on hard tile and broke it so I had to find a replacement. This trimmer works great, my only complaint is the casing is a little cheap but all plastic seems to be getting this way. The adjustable trimmer guard works great and is sturdier than the one on my previous trimmer. There is a trimmer that has a new style battery for 10 bucks more. I think you would have to use a beard trimmer a LOT to need more battery. Make sure you get a full size trimmer if you want to trim the hair on your head though! This trimmer is really only for beards or a little trimming up around the ears or neck."
3,A cut above the rest,"The Wahl trimmer is just ok. The trimmer isn't as wide as thought it would be, I still use my older one from the barber shop. for a touch-up it works fine."
4,Wahl Beard Trimmer,I only used this product twice. Both times it worked flawlessly. I had a Remington before this one but wasn't really happy with it. Hardly used it at all and had it for about 5 years.
3,Great product that didn't last!,"I bought this trimmer awhile back. I absolutely loved it. It worked great for my mustache and other areas. Unfortunately, when I tried to start it up a couple of days ago it was dead. I charged it overnight, but still nothing. Even though I'm very disappointed in the short life of this unit (less than a year), I am purchasing another Wahl (9953) to replace it!"
1,Terrible Shaver!!!!!,"I absolutely hated this shaver. Contrary to the propoganda, it did not trim well at all and after being pinched multiple times, I returned it the next day. Specifically:1. I could not get it to trim the small hairs around the outside ... poor outlining,2. The combs are hard to attach and detach,3. the shaver did not cut cleanly while using the combs,4. There is no recharging light on the shaver,so there's no way to know when/if you have a full charge or not and finally5. The packaging was a nightmare to get through. You'll need a sharp knife (careful) or some kitchen shears to get the shaver out.I returned this shaver the next day. Do not waste your time or money on this shaver."
4,Wahl Revolution Beard Trimmer,"I found the trimmer works very well in all aspects. It replaced a Remington that went bad after only one year. My only dislike is it is loud and noisy. Other than that, it works very well and I like it and would recommend it."
1,Not good,"It's a shame that Wahl took a trimmer that seems to be solid and well made and bundled it with cheap plastic beard guides. They snag so badly they actually pull hair out. Unless you enjoy pain, keep shopping."
1,"Stopped working about 10 day and yanks hairs out, not cut them","Do not buy this. It yanks you hair out rather than cut them. Its flimsy and cheap as hell, made in china for probably less than $3 or $4. It also stopped working for no reason whatsoever after about 10 days without ever being dropped or anything.DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Terrible,"The cheap, plastic guide does not stay attached to the trimmer and falls off while trimming. I'm buying a different brand."
3,good delivery,"was told this was a mustache and beard trimmer it is not as advertised,but usablewill not buy a Wahl trimmer again ."
4,Works great,"This trimmer gets the job done. I fully charged it upon receiving it and the battery has lasted me weeks. 4 different sizes are good, although I only use one and two since I can't grow it any longer than that. Being able to swivel the blade is awesome. It lets me hold the trimmer in a comfortable position no matter which way I need it to face. One big downside is that I have gotten the blade wet a few times to was it and it is now starting to rust. So be careful not to get it too wet and only wet the blade tips."
4,Took 10 years off of my appearance!,I didn't shave for five weeks and desperately needed to trim my beard. After using this trimmer it took 10 years off of my appearance!
2,Wahl disappointment,"I just tossed my Wahl 9876-536 rechargable/cordless beard trimmer in the trash. It just stopped working and would not charge after less than 18 months of use. It was most disappointing since the I have an older model that still works but is now used for moderate trimming on our yorky. Besides longevity and superior charge holding the older model cut better, started quicker, did not have the cutting head pop out(a pain to pop back in). So much for progress. Both models lacked a setting between no attachment and the shortest one. Wahl is on my &%!$#$ list even though they came out with a lithium ion charged model. I will try a Panasonic next."
2,doesn't trim very well,"Maybe it's just me but I don't get very good trimming with this. Without the attachment it'll shave off hair any where, but with the adjustable attachment I find I have to go over and over the same spot many times for it to cut all the whiskers to an even level, and even then it's still uneven. I have Wahl hair clippers that do a much better job, just one pass with an attachment. I use the hair clippers for most of my beard now and just use this trimmer to clean up the edges and a few hard to reach spots (like right under my nose) Also they are very loud. I'm wondering if I might find them more useful if used with a comb without the adjustable attachment. It's also worth noting that my beard grows very thick and dense from my cheeks all the way down my neck so I'm probably an extreme case."
2,"Plastic and cheap, failure",This is a cheap lightweight plastic piece of crap. It takes forever to trim my goatee and hundreds of passes. Forget it for body hair as you'll be bleeding from all the passes you have to make. It does come with a pretty good selection of adjustable heads though. Spend the extra money and get yourself something nice and pass on this dollar store level crap.
2,rapid battery failure,"The trimmer itself works fine. The rechargeable battery lost it's ability to hold any charge at all after a couple of months. Now I have to leave it plugged in all the time to be able to use it at all. It's definitely not a standard battery, and the only place you can get a replacement is from Wahl or one of their online resellers. Considering that, I'd recommend getting the non-cordless model Wahl Revolution Beard Trimmer. Might as well since you might have to keep it plugged in anyway."
1,wahl 9876 bait and switch,"It seems Wahl uses this product to sell outrageously overpriced batteries. The battery in my trimmer requires being constantly plugged in to maintain enough of a charge to operate. The original battery would not carry the shaver after seven months. Replacement batteries with shipping are almost as expensive as the shaver and have no substitutes that I was able to find online. The shaver is not bad, but the battery issue would prevent me from buyer another Wahl product."
5,A delicious book!,"This book talks about a very common event happening among Latino families when they gather together to see the ""atardecer"" (sunset) after eating around 3 or 4 pm, which is the main meal. The narrator describes a pretty scene when three generations (grandparents, parents and children) enjoy a sliced, sweet and cold watermelon and talk about stories in the past like how abuelos meet long time ago, when abuelo's father raised watermelon and how he helped his father selling them, that was how grandfather meet grandmother. This very creative story describes a beautiful Sunday and the conversations, jokes and laughter among a Latino family.A beautiful book recommended to be read among every family in the US."
2,"Don't get ""Natural"" flavor","I ordered this because I wanted the convenience of the individual packages, but I have yet to find a way to actually down the stuff without it tasting absolutely horrible. I've tried water, milk, orange juice, coffee, chocolate Slim Fast, and Gatorade, and the ""natural"" flavor just can't be covered up. I gave it two stars because I'm sure it's a decent protein product and I'd imagine the ""Actually Flavored"" versions would taste much better, but I would steer clear of the ""Natural Flavor"" version."
4,Solid piece of progressive rock,"I'm not a Christian, so the messages delivered in this CD are lost on me, but the musicianship and vocals are outstanding. If you are a neo-prog fan (the likes of IQ, Jadis, Marillion, Illuvatar, Glass Hammer, et al) then you will absolutely LOVE this CD. Multi-layered and full of great harmonies, this CD will not disappoint."
4,"entertaining, but somewhat limited - a good beginner's book","This book was entertaining and well written, including refreshing stories of real people and their experiences. Almost everything concerning martial arts is touched upon, but Only touched upon; subjects get a couple of pages at the very most. Nevertheless, it was very enjoyable, and I recommend it highly for the beginning martial artist as casual reading."
5,Shreker or Schreker......? from Argentina,"This is a wonderful recording, including some obscure pieces as ""The wind"", which are among the most beautiful of Schreker. The interpretation and the recording are peerless, and the music is pure Schreker: lush, subtle and full of color...The daughter of the composer lived here in Argentina after the war, and wrote a very interesant book about her father."
1,not the real thing..it stinks!,"I am an avid shreker fan, and have been forever, when I saw this I snapped it up....then it hit the turtable and all was lost, this item is nowhere near anything a true Franz shreker devotee would want to have anything to do with... it apparently is some sort of facsimile of something shreker purportedly had something to do with, it sounds like music from an american musical...it is ugly stuff, you will thank me for this warning it is a real misrepresentatition.. and it stinks!"
2,Very dissappointing,"Based on ""Empires in the Balance"" and ""The Barrier and the Javelin"" I had high expectations for this book. It didn't deliver. It almost felt like Willmott had needed some extra cash and just thrown together some old notes into a very pedestrian summationof the mid-war years. I'd expected a lot more from this author."
3,An analysis of the strategy of the war in the Pacific.,"This is not your typical book. It is a thesis on the strategy of both opponents in the Pacific. For that, it sheds new light on why the Japanese and Americans did what they did. It talks of what motivated the Japanese to go to war. They wanted to fight the Americans to a draw and keep Asia for themselves. However after their brillant series of victories, a balance was begun. At that point, either side could have won. As the author relates, the pistol was laying in the street. With that, the Americans grabbed the pistol and went on to victory.This is dry reading at times. However it is a nice short summary of the crucial time when victory hung in the balance in the Pacific. The author sheds new strategic light on what happened during this phase of the war."
3,its all right.,"it tastes all right, could be sweeter. if you love a sweet taste, i wouldn't recommend this product. but other than that, its pretty good."
1,Very Disappointed!,"When I first saw this item it was a very nice SPALDING ball & net. I was very interested, nice price. After I bought the item I went back and noticed the picture had changed to a different ball and net. Contacted the seller and they said they sold all different types. Maybe they should have put that in the first place instead of saying it was SPALDING. When I received the item, which shipped quickly, I said okay its fine we can make it work. They ball is kind of cheaply made, just saying, loses air very quickly. I've had the net for a couple of weeks, maybe a month and my daughter was playing volleyball with a friend, she hit the ball and it landed on top of the net and fell straight to the ground, after hitting the top it ripped the side so now we will have to duct tape it somehow. I do not recommend this, they lied about the brand, and it is very cheaply made. Just letting everyone know the truth."
2,For computer beginners only,"This book is WAY too basic for most computer users. I would even think it is too basic for computer beginners; eventually, you're no longer a beginner, and this book will have NOTHING for you.But, if you know someone who's been living in a hole for the last twenty years and has never worked with ANY computer, it is a well-organized introduction to the iMac. And, it's not as gratingly nerdy as the ""Dummies"" books."
1,The book isn't worth its price.,"This compact volume is cute and does explain some things. But there isn't a clue as to how to execute an elementary maneuver such as changing your internet browser or your preferences. Furthermore, the book seems to be a hasty patch-up job using material from earlier MAC books by the same author. I would urge readers to look elsewhere for printed help with the iMAC computer."
1,The Little iMac book,"As a new iMac user, i was very dissapointed with the contents of this book. I found the information to be too vague. It has yet to provide answers to my questions."
2,"For Mac people only. Beginners will find it too ""jumpy""","I love Macs. This is not the best book for beginners, since it jumps from moving the mouse to icons. Although it is very informative, I found that there is a lot more to the iMac then what she wrote. The computer has so many possibilities and the book is so small, page-wise. Also, the pictures and text are small and hard to read. Get this if you want, but the better, more fun and informative book is definitely The iMac for Dummies by David Pogue."
4,An introduction,"I started doing yoga a little over 35 years ago. This was one of my first books, and over the years I have probably given out over 20 copies of it to friends who were interested in learning more about what yoga is. It's not the best book (is there one?), and much of my later teaching contradicts some of the asanas as described in this book. Still, though, it taught me the basics - not only of the poses, but also of the philosophy behind yoga.If you've already taken classes and are well on your way to becoming a yogi(ni), this isn't the book for you. However, if you can't afford lessons or are in a rural area without access to good teachers, get this book. It will be a welcome traveler with you throughout your life."
5,"Oh, no...not again!","I have bought this book five times since 1975 - I have given them away, lost them in moving, just lost them...you name it. It is STILL the only yoga book I have ever read that is perfectly do-able and is not intimidating. It's a simple program, and the way the author breaks it down day by day is really helpful for my lack of ""stick-to-it-iveness!"""
5,Good for Every Decade,"I first bought and used this book in the early 1970's, when I was in high school. It noticeably changed my body. I went on to take classes in yoga and continued through college. This book was so easy to follow and the routines so calming. Later in life I put on weight and again this book came to the rescue. After I had my children, it came in handy once again. The pictures may look dated, but it works. If you are studying yoga, get this book and any of Mr. Hittleman's books. He was the greatest."
3,Easy to follow instructions?!,"I'm amazed at all the people reviewing this who say the instructions are easy to follow. Part of the reason I was reading the reviews was to figure out if anyone was reading the instructions the same way I am. I've had to pass the book around to others and ask, ""What do YOU think this says?"" I LOVE this book and am very torn on how to rate it, because though I believe the yoga is very beneficial, the instructions just don't make sense. I never get very far into the book because I get so frustrated by the instructions. The first couple days it seems like you do the exercises then 1-6 and then the exercises again, but then day 3 it sounds like they want you to do 1-6 twice. And when I'm repeating something they describe earlier in the book and it tells me to do it 3 times, do they mean three times EXACTLY the way it's listed (often making for 6 whole stretches)? For a book that is so insistant on ""THIS IS THE WAY YOU MUST DO THINGS"" it could use some claification."
4,28 day yoga plan,"I purchased this book for my daughter , she said she is enjoying it so far .. was recommended to her by a relative :)"
4,informative book if interested in yoga,"I knew I would never be able to consistently attending any yoga classes, so on the recommendation of a doctor, I tried out this book. It is not like attending a class, because it is up to you to read instructions carefully and follow all of them. It starts off with pretty easy moves and quickly escalates.My 50+ year old body rebelled at some of the postures, but I could quickly tell that my body was appreciating all the stretching. I am on day 14 and still plugging along. The pictures are very good at assisting you to get the positions correctly. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to at least get a taste of yoga."
5,One great book!,"I bought my first copy of this book 30 years ago and have used it as a guide for daily yoga stretches ever since. Being able to order a new copy because the first one is fallen apart was wonderful! Same exact book, same great instructions. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to practice some useful yoga techniques - beginners especially - young or old!"
5,Hittleman's 28-Day Yoga,"This is an easy to follow and excellent intro to yoga. After 28 days I have learned several positions, with possibilities for doing more advanced versions. I am more flexible and stronger already! Can't beat the used price of 7 cents either.Richard Hittleman's Yoga: 28 Day Exercise Plan"
5,Richard Hittleman's Yoga,This is a yoga book that works. You see results. Its easy to understand and follow. Over my life (71 yrs.) I come back to it time and time again. thomas chelius
4,An excellent beginners resource for at-home yoga exercise.,"If you want a really good intro to the practice of yoga and you have at least attended a class with some instruction, this is a great book to get you started on daily exercise. It covers most of the primary positions you need to learn to work your way into more advanced postures. Furthermore, after 28 days of this program, you will have a new body! Try it!"
5,A Good Place To Start,"Overall this is a very good book for yoga beginners. Each pose has photographs and text to describe it, plus an overview of the purpose of the pose. Most of the poses (or simple variations of them) are within reach of the average out-of-shape person. The only real problem with the book is at the very end. The author leaves the student with sets of poses to practice on a three day cycle. The practice sets are helpful, but they're not enough to carry the student forward. So go ahead and start with this book; you will feel better. But at the end, don't forget to seek out new information and perspectives so that you can continue to make progress."
3,Average Greek Grammar book,just average Greek grammar textbook. I think Mounce's Basic Biblical greek is better textbok than this.Some content is very useful and clear to get the key idea
5,"Nice, easy approach","Sakae Kubo is a woman. The book has 236 pages, not 100 pages. It has 100 chapters. I like the easy, gradual approach of this book. Lots of review chapters, and the last 50 chapters are reading/application incorporating bits of grammar, while the first 50 are more formal instruction, though with every 5th chapter being a review."
5,nice one,"I bought this movie for my little sister and she loved it. I also watched it with her!,the packege was so nice and my sister loved it so much. generally the whole things were really cool and perfect or can i just say it was shone?."
2,Executioner's Current,"Whilst Mr. Moran presents a compelling story, it is nontheless a biased one - I was also left wanting for more background on the characters, which the book does not really cover and required much other reading to fill in the gaps.From a writer's perspective, the language and often the story is highly repetitve, with much unnecessay page-filling."
2,Disappointed,"I was unhappy when I received the cards because I had planned a bingo party with decorations around the color of the bingo card, ""RED"". To my surprise when I received the cards they were bright orange. This is not good! I even purchased the red bingo chips to go with the cards, they looked terrible for my party, orange cards with red chips."
3,Just fine,"It is adequate - did not burn my toast or bagels. I did notice that the element wires are wound unevenly so when it is on, some lines are red hot whilst others are not - this may cause uneven toasting but I have never paid attention.The bagel feature - turning off one side of toasting, is fine, except you cannot turn it back on till the current toasting is finished."
3,Great toaster but a bit big,"I bought this toaster after having the same one in our office kitchen. It works great and is nice looking. The one thing I didn't account for was the size of the toaster on our work counter which is 20 feet long. When I put the toaster in my home kitchen which is 4 feet, the toaster seems to dominate the counter top and dwarf the microwave. Other than that is a decent toaster for the price."
4,2x the fun with spiderman and green goblin,"This game is a challenging game waiting for expert gamers to buy it. It is a lot of fun and it is not very easy. It is a lot of fun because you get to play as spiderman and the green goblin. The only negative thing I would say about it is it is a little too challenging. Imagine being at the first boss in this game, after completing 1 lv. with spiderman and 1 lv. with the green goblin. The next level is fighting the green goblin with spiderman and the green goblin uses the cheapest moves known to video games!!!! Other than that it is a very good game waiting for people to buy it!!!"
5,Awesome! (some spoilers),"I really liked this book. A lot. It had a nice love triangle. I was completely obsessed with it. Cara and Devin's relationship was nicely built, as well as her relationship with Roger. Two thumbs up, definitly. You did a very good job with this one, Mondello! :)"
5,LOVE IT!,Loved this book. Hilariously funny. I couldn't put it down. Definitely read more form this author. Great characters and flows nicely. Not a book that leaves you wondering if you missed a chapter or three.
3,Entertaining!,A good read but spell check could have been better. I enjoyed reading the story and would have liked to continue following the story. Just didn't want it to end.
4,4.5 stars,"I was completely delighted the whole time I was reading THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT. Right from Chapter One I enjoyed the characters. Cara, about to approach her 35th birthday, was single and heading to her childhood home to help her mother, Ruthie, prepare the home for sale. Cara knows that this as not going to be an easy task. Between dealing with her mother and with the stress of single hood Cara knew things were bound to become complicated.The novel takes us on a romantic adventure that starts from finding a wedding contract signed by Cara and her childhood best friend, Devin, on Cara's 18th birthday. Don't be fooled by all this...there are twists and turns, heartbreak and disappointment, as well as forgiveness, love and faith. I absolutely loved this book and finished it in one day because I had to see how it all turned out. You will laugh, cry and root for love to allow for second changes. Pick up The Marriage Contract and settle down for a great 4.5 star read."
5,Excellent Album,"Listened to this album as a teenager, and have never forgotten it. Finally, have just got it on CD. Beautiful lyrics. Lovely music. Would never claim to be big into music, but you can't help falling in love with this album. A classic."
5,Japanese Tea Set,I love the tea set. I bought it for my husband for his birthday because he is an avid tea drinker. No regrets. Everything about is great! Love the color and design.
3,Very Hot,The cups get extremely hot... almost too hot to pick up and drink out of. Something to consider when buying cast iron cups.
5,Nice product,"This product was very nice quality. Heavy yet elegant and a decent size for 1-2 people yielding about 5 cups (cups it comes with, not 8oz cups) of tea."
5,Perfect!,"This is a great tea pot. It's not big, but works wonderfully. It's cast iron and holds heat well, so your tea will stay hot for a good long while. It is also heavy and well made, and seems quite durable. I would be very surprised if I don't have this thing for years. The cups that it comes with are also quite nice, and similarly well constructed. It's a very nice tea pot for one or two people, get it and you will not be disappointed."
1,Stay Aawy From This DVD!,"Firstly, it comes as a huge surprise to me that the ""Journey Within A Journey"" is available at Amazon.com, but the price of the DVD--exorbitant to say the least--did not shock me. In desperate situations, people often try to market garbage by creating an aura of exclusivity around the product.I had the opportunity of viewing this docudrama (surely, it cannot be termed a film) when its creator Chitra Neogy, in an attempt to generate buzz for it, gave it to me for my personal viewing. Well, it's the work of a very clumsy amateur with no creative talent whatsoever. The ""Journey With A Journey"" will take you, at best, on a 90-minute journey of little else but revulsion, leaving you, at its end, with one question only: What was all that about?All you potential viewers: Please spare yourselves the horror of watching Neogy's pièce de résistance."
1,"Would be 0 stars, if it could be",Totally worthless. This book is mainly blank pages. What content is there is thin and uninformative.
5,Playwrights handbook,"This book was exactly what I needed for my Play-writing course. It certainly was put to great use, and I did well in the class. Thank you for a great service and affordable book price. The price on Amazon was much less than what my campus book store wanted. The book arrived as described and I am a happy customer. Thank you"
4,Good socks,"Socks are comfortable although they make my feet sweat more-so than they would have. On runs of 4+ miles they will really be wet feeling. Sizing is like any other no-show sock. A large will usually fit 10-13 so if you wear an 11 like I do buy the medium socks. They stretch. A large size will be baggy and come high on a size 11 shoe. Socks start to fuzz up if dryed with high heat, use low heat and cold water to preserve. Now buy em and start running! Good sock."
2,effective but poor service,"I received this broom and I'm happy with the rubber part of the broom itself, however, the pins that keep it together aren't fitted properly with the holes so it's wobbly and rickety and the plastic handle (which never did fit well) split and broke off the second time I used it. When it arrived it was covered in dust and dirt and animal hair. It was absolutely filthy. It washed, of course, but I was deeply UNimpressed with the company sending this product in that condition. If I had it to do over I'd still get a similar broom but from a different company. I chose this one because it was a few dollars cheaper. I got what I paid for."
5,truly great floor sweeper,"i am safisfied with the deluxe one sweep, great for picking up dirt or pet hair off floor without having to lug the vacuum around."
3,Takes the snow off the car,"I like this product. I bought it to take hair off the carpet. It did not do well on that, but I loved it all winter to easily get the snow off my car"
2,Disappointing,"I read lots of positive reviews and decided to give this a try. However I am not impressed as it does not glide easily and is not easy to use in small corners. Also it has a tendency to trap hairs and is a pain to clean. I did not send it back as I had already paid a lot of postage (as not sold by amazon and so was not eligible for free shipping) and add to that the return postage, it would have been more than the price of the broom!! I will have to use it exclusively with cloths for mopping hard floors, but I will definitely not benefit from the long list of uses that have been described. I would best have bought something else for the price."
2,One Sweep = One big waste of money,"I bought the One Sweep Broom to get cat hair out of my carpets. Unless you have tremendous upper-body strength, doing so is nearly impossible. A traditional, stiff-bristle outdoor broom does a much better job in less time. I also have no problem using a traditional mop on my tile floors, so this product was a complete waste of my money. The only saving grace is that it didn't break on day one."
1,Eh.. rubber wears out Quick!,"We have a golden retriever with long blond hair, that gets EVERYWHERE.. We don't have many carpets because of the shedding.. (woe our cold and tired feet) We do however have an area rug and a runner on our stairs. One sweep works best on the flat side as oppoosed to the bristle side. But the rubber gives out soo fast, we're on our 3rd one sweep in 2 years. AND YES its a ton of work..I don't know what we are going to do, I am online today looking at carpet rakes w/ metal bristles.. I hate to admit we've been picking the dog hair up w/ a wet towel, we're literally on our hands and knees!!.. I love my pup, but what a headache.Skip the one sweep, there has to be something better."
1,"Useless! Get the ""Deluxe""or don't bother!","The ""Original"" One Sweep has now been branded the ""Deluxe"".Recently sent my wife out to purchase a new one to replace our aging original and was horrified to see what she had bought!The packaging claimed it was the ""Original"", As Seen On TV!, etc... But this new model was nothing like OUR Original from 2004!This model only has 300+ fingers, while the ""Deluxe"" has some 800+ fingers to work with! Big difference!Have been using the ""Deluxe"" model since 2004 and wouldn't be without one!Great for hardwood floors, shop floors, sidewalks, etc... Haven't found a material yet that it wouldn't pick up!So save your money, buy a ""Deluxe"" and you'll love it!"
5,Sweep Broom,"My husband bought me one of these rubber brooms, and I just love the way it cleans my hardwood floors!! I have 3 dogs, and I use the squeegie side to gather the pet hair and dust. It is fantastic, and even gets deeply into the corners of the room and under furniture.So, I bought another one for myself, and one for my mom. She loves it!!It is a great product!!"
3,"The good, the bad (and some of the ugly too)","Great idea...cook when you have the time and freeze the meals so you have something on hand for those crazy days when you're short on time. Unfortunately, the plan falls short in the recipe department.Nearly all the recipes can be halved, so please, please, please test them before you buy ingredients in quantity. You may find, as I did, that some of the recipes just don't taste all that great. Most are bland, at best. However, you can doctor them very easily, IF you have some experience as a cook and know how to do this. Beginning cooks may be lost.Some of the recipes were just plain inedible and one, a lentil/rice stew, required far more water than the recipe specified...PLUS I had to keep watching the pot since the lentils kept sticking to the bottom. It came out fine but only after I added lots of spices and some extra ingredients."
1,Possibly the most useless book I've ever read,"If you consider making about 10 Kilos of mystery meatballs and serving them up with canned tomato soup and grape jelly/chili mixes a culinary delight, then this is the book for you! If your receipe for making spagetti sauce starts by adding cans of ready made sauce, then buy it. If you invite friends to your place for potluck dinners to save cooking expenses by eating their leftovers, you'll give this book 5 stars. If you need cooking tips like ""salad does not freeze well,"" you'll find this book an invaluable resource. Ok, granted, I live in France, a country where ""cuisine"" like this could probably have you expelled from the country. On the other hand, it has given me an idea of a money saving tip for the mystery meatballs which can help readers of this book save lots of $: garden snails (escargots) are a free, easy-to-find replacement for the ground beef or turkey!"
5,"Extremely helpful, achievable","I read through this book in 2 days! I was so motivated to start my OAMC, even my husband is in on it. I love how she outlined step by step how to prepare, how to get started, and all the little tips in between. This is genius. I too homeschool and have 5 children (under 6) at home and I'm a working mom (full time night shift) so this is probably the best thing me and my family can do to free up time and money! This is a must, I don't know how anyone could give this book a bad rating. Love it."
4,Great gift for Multiple Kid mom,I gave this to my Friend who has several kids and she loved it. It's a real time saver and lets her have lots more time playing with her kids.
5,Frozen Assets,"This is one of my all time favorite cookbooks. I am indebted to Deborah Taylor-Hough for saving me time, energy and money in my kitchen! This whole philosophy of cooking for the freezer makes so much sense. And as a *retired* caterer and nutritionist, I heartily recommend this book. It is nutritionally sound as well as delicious! When's the next one, Deborah? :-)"
2,Frozen Assets Not an Asset on the Bookshelf,"I got interested in freezer cooking and purchased the book ""Frozen Assets"" after finding lots of tasty recipes on the internet. I should have stopped before I bought the book, because not only does the author repeat recipes constantly throughout the book, at the time most of the recipes were available on the author's web site (although they are not at this time). There's not a lot of variety in her suggestions, either. I'm sorry, but if my family had to eat cheese enchiladas seven times in one month alone, they would mutiny on me!I think the cooking ahead idea is wonderful, and for someone with little imagination and no internet access, the book is a boon. But for the rest of us, we can just scour the net for recipes and get the rest of the information on how to get started from websites."
3,"A bit plain, repetitive and lacking in efficiency.","Some people may like having a the same meat mix for their sauce, meatballs, meatloaf, etc; however I find it to be a bit plain. The same dishes are repeated over and over in different meal plans and many meals are cooked to prepare it, and then cooked for another hour the day it is served. I prefer Don't Panic-Dinner's in the Freezer for it's variety, easy to prepare meals and efficiency."
5,I like the Holiday Meal Plan idea.,"This book has a Ten Day Holiday Meal Plan. I've never seen anything like it. Looks like a great idea. I can't wait to pack my holiday meals away in the freezer. I won't have to think much about cooking when busy during the holidays. I might even use the plan at Thanksgiving. BTW, I tried the Turkey Manicotti recipe. It was to die for!"
4,great info,"I really liked this book...more for the info about HOW to freeze, what freezes well... health concerns about freezing than for the recipes. There were really some that i wouldnt even consider eating BUT that is true of all cook books frankly... this book gives many options for freezing food (all at once..doubling recipes... etc) It gives insights when you have very little freezer room too (like the top of fridge freezer) i found this book the MOST helpful on the subject ...i would have given it a 5 if i liked more of the recipes...or maybe if the recipes were written with more subsitution possibilites"
2,Just wasn't impressed.,"I was really looking forward to getting a copy of this book because most of the reviews were so positive, but I was really disappointed, mostly because of the recipes. First of all, there really isn't that many. Also, I don't understand making ""home-made spaghetti sauce"" and using store-bought spaghetti sauce in it! I thought there needed to be more chicken recipes, and why are some of the recipes repeated 2 or 3 times? I felt like I was ripped off, the recipes are low-quality and low-quantity. However, the freezer instructions are good."
2,I've seen better,I have purchased several books on freezer cooking and I found this one does not have enough recipes for the average family. It's a good book if you are just looking for new ideas but I wouldn't recommend it if you are just begining the freezer cooking adventure.
1,Please don't feed this trash to your family,"The concept of bulk cooking is something I've been doing for years. And you can do it too, without ""studying"" the concept. Simply make it a rule to never cook one meal and you'll soon work out the details in a way that fits your lifestyle.But for goodness sake, don't feed yourself or your family the junk suggested in this book.I felt this author did a disservice, because so many people are desperate to save time. It isn't a savings if the time you save is spent at the doctors office, or so fatigued from a bad diet that you can't do anything but sit glassy-eyed in front of a television. This kind of diet doesn't grow healthy kids, either."
3,Not any different...,The book I purchased was a revised edition. I already had the second edition.The only difference was the format. The recipes and plans were exactly the same. If you have the second edition don't waste your money!
5,Valuable asset worth owning!,"Despite my muscle disorder, this book has helped out many times with my family of five. I will never be able to handle once-a-month cooking. But by utilizing the bulk cooking concept along with all the information on menu planning, shopping, cooking and freezing foods; I have enjoyed times of NOT worrying about what my family will eat. With step-by-step instructions, most any one can easily follow. And I especially enjoy the variety of affordable recipes. It's definitely worth owning!"
5,The best cookbook I own!,"I consider myself an avid cookbook collector--and of the hundreds on my shelves, this is the most worthwhile cookbook to every enter my home! As a career mom who travels frequently, I struggle to find answers for feeding my husband and 3 year-old (picky eater!) daughter. This book holds the answers. In a matter of 8 hours, I was able to fill our freezer with 40 days of meals. And what's best--the family loved them! I also froze some individual sizes for days when I'm gone or if my husband needs a quick lunch. I can't say enough about this book. Grab a copy and discover its magic for yourself."
2,"Great planning, poor recipes","I agree that this book helps the novice once a month cook to plan, buy and cook the meals. However, the recipes for many of the dishes are not what was expected. For example, in the section for the once a month cooking, it says to have 3 meals of one of the dishes, but the actual recipe calls for you to divide it into 4 parts. And I am very disappointed in how many times some of the recipes are in the book. As someone else stated, taste is a very personal thing, and I knew going into this that we may or may not like everything. But that is part of the learning process of this, as with anything else that is done in life."
5,What a team up,"If you a fan of both Marvel and DC or like on over the other, this title is the right choice for you! You'll love the combination of Batman and Spiderman. You'll love how they share similarities such as the killed parent tragedy and the mad freaks they battle. Watch as they battle 2 of the most deadliest madmen, Carnage and the Joker!"
1,Product Discontinued,This product has a major flaw with the temperature control panel on the top front. They go bad fast. Mine only lasted 2 years. It is out of warranty and no parts are available according to Danby customer service because it has been discontinued. Don't waste your money.
1,Too Loud and Bad Service,"I bought this product at Home Depot and from the beginning it was extremely loud. The rest of the unit wasn't too bad it was a nice looking fridge. After only about 2 weeks I noticed that the temperature would vary between 32 and 45 (I had the setting set for 34) and the unit would not start cooling until it hit 45. After a few more days the unit failed to cool at all. That's where the fun began, serval calls later we finally had a service tech out who took it back to the shop... and that was 1 month ago - calls to Danby and the Service tech get answers of ""we are waiting on a circuit board from China - should be arriving in a few weeks"". I have sent e-mails to Danby with no returns. I have threaten to take it back to Home Depot and have been told that if I want to do that, I will have to pick it up from the service tech (15 miles away). Stay away from Danby!!!!"
2,warm beer/ to much foam,Purchased this unit new and followed directions putting the unit in service cannot run co2 at the pressure that was instructed way to much foam and temp only goes to 34 degrees if your lucky. Beer is to warm even in frozen mugs i will try and get different thermostat
4,What if saving someone's life meant risking your own?,"This film tells an extraordinary tale of survival and struggle between two strangers (Alexander Potapov and Sam Waterston) and the terrifying forces of nature. In the opening scene, meteorologist Royce (Waterston) is flying home after a tour of duty as a meteorologist in the Arctic when he spots a downed plane. Royce volunteers to parachute in with supplies to help a survivor until a recue helicopter can pick them up the next day. Both men soon realize that they may not be rescued and must rely on each other to survive. A film you will enjoy watching over and over again. Based on the novel by James Aldridge."
2,My kids asked to not continue watching.....,"My 9 year old loves reading the Sugar Creek Gang book. However it was painful to watch this Movie ""Swamp Robbers."" I felt like we were watching a bad '80s show - the acting was mediocre, and the special were effects horrible. My children asked to stop watching this - I could not convince them to finish the show. We are a mostly TV free family - our kids are not in the habit of spending hours watching the Disney Channel or Cartoon Network - so they don't expect super fast moving plots - this movie was just very slow - perhaps Senior Citizens would enjoy it more.*My 9 year old's assessment of the movie is this: ""It looks like some kids made this movie using a camera at home."""
2,Musical Cake Server,"I have the musical cake server shown in the photo. However, the item I ordered and received is not the item shown. They are posting an old photo unfortunately. The server works, however, it is a bit cheesy compared to the item shown. Disappointing."
4,Good for those who've never camped,"This DVD holds true to its title. The beginners guide to camping offers the most basic information for those who have never been before. I have camped many times before, and found this to be informative on the basics. If your looking to go into bear country, you may want to look elsewhere. But if your looking to be filled in on the absolute basics, this may be for you..."
3,"Great story, terrible quality !","Sullivan entertainment should be ashamed for delivering these series on DVD in this Quality. I bought this for my wife, she loves Anne of Greengables and she looked forward to see this serie on DVD. But a 100 times rented out VHS-tape is better quality than this. You can litterely see the pixels on TV !!Come on Sullivan this could be digitally restored..."
4,Wonderful beginnings,"This is a wonderful start to the series except, yes, no theme song which was very sad indeed. If you're an Anne fan then this series should fill any void with returns from Marilla Cuthbert and Rachel Lynde."
2,Horrible DVD Quality,"I don't know what all the fuss is about, the dvd quality is horrible and the series is so boring. I'm a huge fan of Anne of Green Gables and this series doesn't even compare. The acting is terrible and the movie is slow and boring."
2,"Like the other guy said; ""Great story, terrible quality !, ""","The first DVD in this set was very clear, but the rest are of extremely poor quality. You can literally see each pixel on the screen, and after a while of squinting to see you start to get a headache. If you love Road to Avonlea, then these are the DVD's for you, just proceed with caution!"
2,Awesome series - poor quality copy,"I love this series and have been waiting to see if the price would drop, but finally just told my husband it was one of the few things I REALLY wanted for Christmas. So we got the 1st season. Extremely disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The first episode is so grainy/pixelated there are times where you can barely make out what it is. I can't believe we paid $50 for something this poor of quality. I can't say enough good things about the show itself. I loved watching it on the Disney channel as a kid. I am a huge L.M Montgomery fan and love this even though I am not too fond of the Anne of Green Gables movies. I remember looking forward to new episodes each week and how beautiful the show is - it's really too bad if this is the best copy you can get. I'd love to know if I could get a better version from someone else. Feel ripped off."
5,Road to Avonlea review,The product was just like they said and was delivered on time and in very good condition. I would order from them again.
5,Enjoyable and Relaxing!,"Today's entertainment is so fast paced, violent and has it fair share of bad humor/curse words and inappropriate situations. However, the Road To Avonlea series is *Gentle, *Peaceful, full of *Happy endings and cheerfullness. But more importantly, it is CLEAN and VOID of objectional content!!! This is what makes Avonlea so attractive."
4,Favorite Childhood show!,"I started watching this show when it originally aired on Disney as a kid. I am a big fan of the LMM books and it's fun to see the adaptation.I agree with most of the review here, the quality of the DVD's is certainly lacking, though the actual content of the show makes up for it (at least, it does for me! But I'm a truly a nerdy fan).I'd also like to point out - the order of the episodes on disc 3 is incorrect. It should be:- Proof in the Pudding- Conversions- Aunt Abigail's Beau- Malcolm and the Baby"
4,Happy to finally have RtA on DVD,"I was so excited to get the first season of my all-time favourite show on DVD. As always, I give top marks to the show, it's beautifully acted and filmed. The only reason I didn't give the DVD 5 stars was because I was a bit disappointed with the bonus features, and I would have liked to have seen it digitally restored. but in terms of the quality of the actual show, you can't get any better.enjoy!"
5,This is a fantastic collection!,"Here's music that gets the heart pumping and makes you feel happy to be alive. Rico has gone into great detail about the songs and the artists -- and every word he says is true. This is one of those CDs that lives in my car and is played, often, at maximum volume with the moonroof wide open. I've heard it a hundred times and I still love it like crazy."
1,too many typos and incorrect usage errors,"I found 10 typos & usage problems in the first 4 pages. This book couldn't have been edited by a professional. This is the worst example of shoddy editing and proofreading I have ever seen. Here are just two examples from page 15:""Checklists on what information should be gathered and can be located in Appendix B.""The next sentence reads as follows: ""Remember, the custodian is limited by time to complete the report it is usually 20 days from the site-visit to the submission of the report.""It appears that it was written and edited by a non-English speaking person."
5,Pure Genius!!!,"The man, the myth, the legend. This young chap covers the environmental world like nobody else! Good work!! This book is a must in every Americans' collection!!"
4,3.5 stars would be more accurate,"This package of noodles is a nice size for one. You get a plastic tray with uncooked rice noodles, a fork, a packet of chili oil, and a seasonings packet. You put the rice noodles in the tray, fill with water and microwave for 3-4 minutes. then put the top on to drain the noodles. Then add the seasoning packet and chili oil. The finished product doesnt look like much, but it is delightfully spicy and somewhat filling although completely lacking nutrition. I scored them for a dollar a box, but would be hesitant to pay much more than that. For what I paid, I am satisfied, but probably would have been disappointed if I paid the regular price of $2.50/box."
4,great cookware,I replaced all the old worn out pots and pans in my kitchen with this set. I think it is well worth the asking price. The only thing I think could be improved upon is the handles could be a no heat transfer handle. I need to use the hot pad to handle them. They wash nice and cook well. And they look nice all pretty in my kitchen. :o)
5,uniquely kick ass,"I love this song because it's got a good beat and its the kind of song that makes you want to go clubbin, but it's not annoying like a lot of club songs is the thing! Very underground techno."
5,"Wonderful Parfum...Wonderful Vendor: Perfumes4All,Inc.","A Wonderful scent by Guerlain has been discontinued. I ordered Samsara in the Eau De Parfum 1.7oz size thru Amazon. The vendor, Perfumes4All, Inc. shipped my order in a generic/refill bottle. They quickly took action to correct my disappointment and turned this into a wonderful shopping experience. I would recommend Perfumes4All, Inc. to everyone. Thank you Perfumes4All, Inc."
2,Not very well constructed,"I bought this from a home store and as soon as I got it open and up, I could tell there was something wrong with it. The one I bought was unbalanced and was defective. It would only balance on three of the feet, so something was off about it. I don't know that it's worth $40 even if it had been balanced. I haven't decided if I'll exchange it for the same one, or get something different. I just have a regular T-leg one, and I was looking for something more sturdy (toddlers around) and thought one with feet would be more sturdy."
1,Unstable,"I bought this several years ago from amazon and have regretted the purchase ever since. It is wobbly. but better than some that I could buy locally. The biggest problem for me is the lever where you release the legs is inexplicably located underneath the right side of the board - it is awkward and wrong, and it makes me long for the wobblier boards that are correctly engineered. Almost every time I have taken out the ironing board I have broken a nail, or injured a limb. I'm ready to buy a new board because the only way I can like this board is if I never put it away. The fact that I'm writing this review 2-3 years after the fact is a testament to how bad it is. I hope I can find something better soon!"
1,Iron holster is defective,Same experience as a previous poster with the holster. Bought this product at a local retailer. Got it home to find the holster was defective with a plastic clip on the back side that had become dislodged during shipment and could not be repaired without super glue and luck that would hold. Back to the store it goes. I find it disappointing that a $60 retail ironing board would be so poorly made.
2,WOBBLY AND UNSTABLE,"THIS IS ANOTHER HORRIBLE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTED IRONING BOARD THAT IS MADE IN CHINA. MAY I SAY MORE. PAID $60.OO FOR IT NEW, WORTH ONLY ABOUT $10.00. DONT BUY IT, SAVE YOUR MONEY. RESEARCH THE INTERNET LIKE ME, AND FIND ONE WITH GREAT REVIEWS."
2,Not recommended,"I do not agree with the previous positive reviews.First issue I have is with the language. The text is very wordy and convoluted. I do not find it clear and straightforward at all and, in my opinion, it does not make for a pleasant read. I think the problem might be due to the fact that the author is writing in English, not in his native language.While there is (some) content, I found several questionable points, like statements that appear contradictory, explanations that do not make sense and factual inaccuracies.If you are looking for a practical reference on how to manage and build a brand, how to systematically approach a real business situation, I would not recommend this book."
3,Interesting sheets,"With this heavy a thread count, these sheets are more like blankets. They're very stiff, even after repeated washings, and come out of the dryer horribly wrinkled. Ironing doesn't take the wrinkles out at all, and really now....who wants to iron sheets??? I know that they'll last for years, but I'll stick with a lower threadcount from this point."
1,Exfoliating sheets??,"I purchased these sheets earlier this year (2007) and loved the color and just knew that the 1200 threadcount would make them luxuriously soft. How wrong I was.The color (lilac) was beautiful, but the sheets are like two pieces of sandpaper. I could exfoliate my entire body using these sheets because they take a whole layer of skin off when you're lying in bed.I washed them several times with fabric softener, but they never got comfortable. What a waste of money."
4,quality sheets,I was not sure what to expect as far as quality and such. I was pleased with them when I washed them. They fit my pillow top mattress beautifully! My only small complaint was the wrinkle real bad when you wash and dry them. I wasn't expecting that. Overall I am very pleased with them and would not hesitate to buy another set.
1,save your money,"not comfortable, not soft, upholster your chair with this material but dont sleep on it. too heavy, dense and stiff. it's not the thread count but the quality of the cotton that really counts."
2,Durable but not very soft,"I imagined 1200 thread count would be extremely soft but these sheets feel more like plastic. They are very thick and I assume they will last a long time, but I bought these as a rare treat and feel very disappointed."
5,Luxury,"I love these sheets, the top sheet is like a spring blanket with the thread count. These sheets are like new jeans, a little stiff at first but after a few washes they are so comfortable. I can't wait until they are about a year old to see how comfortable they are going to be."
3,"It's thick and well constructed, but not worth $600","I got this set for my anniversary back in April. It's well constructed and thick. It's been 4 months now and we like it. The color is very nice. It tight fits a 18 inches mattress (don't think it will fit more than 18 inches).First time we put it on (after washed), it was so stiff and hard. After 3-4 times we washed it. It becomes soften a little. If you like really soft bedsheets, this set is not for you. The most soften bedsheets are bwtween 400 and 600 thread-count.A lot of people complain it winkles a lot. Well, if you take it out from the dryer right after the cycle is over, instead of let it sits for an hour. It wasn't really bad.I wouldn't say I disappoint on this set, but at the same time, I wouldn't say I am excited to get a good deal on this item. It worths around $100."
3,Like Canvas!,"I purchased these (king size) even after reading the reviews. I don't mind ironing while watching tv, but it took me over an hour! I have a large capacity washer and dryer and washed the top and bottom sheets separately (along with lighter weight items). I removed them from the washer immediately and dried them on the low setting. I just knew that if they over-dried, any wrinkles would be set for life. I did not over-dry them but there are a few areas with horrible, permanent folds and wrinkles now. Even though they are smooth, they are heavy and stiff. My husband says they feel like a canvas tent. He hates them. They're so stiff that they're ""noisy."" I know that sounds weird, but any movement while sleeping will wake you up! I'm hoping that they will soften after repeated washings. We'll see...."
3,Not as soft as expected,"These are nice sheets, but for 1,200 thread count I would expect it to feel much softer (just like butter). Even after washing it with fabric softener, it is still not as soft as I anticipated."
3,2 and a half years later...,These sheets are still stiff. 2.5 years later. They seem to be holding up well. The top sheet was small barely fitting width wise across the top of my Queen mattress. Very wrinkly but I don't care as I usually have a comforter over them anyway.
2,Question the quality,"I received my sheets today. As I do with all clothes/bedding/towels I buy, I always run them through the rinse cycle once before I use it. After the cycle finished, I noticed there was a 3 inch hole in the seams of one of the corners. Now I don't know if it was there before the rinse cycle or not, but regardless of which, I question the quality of these.1. They're not suppose to arrive defective.2. If they didn't come defective, the seams shouldn't break after ONE RINSE!!!I'm getting these replaced by Amazon. (thank god for their excellent return services). However, now my questions about this product went from ""how soft/comfortable are these"" to ""I wonder how long these will last"".I gave it 2 stars because they are indeed beautiful sheets. Can't say much else about these since they were only out of the box for 3 hours.Also, they did not feel that soft to me. Maybe they've been in the package too long and have not been aired to fluff and soften them up."
2,Sheet review,These sheets are not as smooth and wrinkle free as I like. They do not come out of the dryer soft and wrinkle free.
5,Stays cool all night and sooo soft!,I can't believe some of these reviews! I must've gotten the wrong sheets because my husband & I LOVE ours! They are so soft and luxurious! What a great deal! I am buying a few more sets!
2,"STIFF, STIFF, STIFF!","I bought the queen-size sheets without reading any reviews, and these sheets are terrible! I washed them many times with added fabric softener, which didn't soften them at all! I have to use a different pillow case since the pillow case is too rough for my face! I would never purchase them again and would recommend that other buyers spend their money on a different set of sheets!"
3,"Sturdy, but not soft","After having purchased 400 thread count sheets in the past and finding them to be far softer than anything I'd ever had before, I thought that 1200 thread count would be like satin. I was wrong... at least for this product. I've had these sheets (in pecan) for about a month now. Out of the package I found them to be very course (similar to some 100 thread count sheets I picked up at Target). I've washed them 3 times already and have not found them to be significantly softer. That being said, there is not doubt they are some of the highest quality manufacture of any sheets I've ever purchased. They are well made and sturdy, thick, large enough to easily fit the corners of the bed, and look great. I just wish they were softer."
3,A love hate relationship with sheets?,"I love these sheets and I hate these sheets. They wrinkle like no other fabric I've ever washed, but the softness and the feel of these against my skin are amazing. I would recommend these to anyone who is willing to iron the sheets before placing them on the bed. However, if you like a neat bed, with tidy corners and a smoothly draping top sheet, you should probably pass."
1,"1,200 Thread Count 100% cotton sateen king sheet set, jade","I purchased the above product in 2006. I opened the package and used them in 2007. After they were washed twice I found that it was virtually impossible to get them to fit on the bed. They shrunk so much! I have regular king size pillows and cannot even get the cases on the pillow. I tried to return these, but was told that I purchase them too long ago, and I could only get 50% back and I would have to pay for the shipping. I think the company should stand behind this product. I have much less expensive sheet sets and this did not happen to them.DO NOT BUY, NO WORTH THE MONEY."
2,Sateen Sheet Set,"They are very heavy, hard to wash because of weight. Also they wrinkle even when taken right out of the dryer. Hard to fold because weight."
2,"At this price, run away, run away!!","I picked up a set of these sheets at $59 (for king) so don't feel I can kick all that much, but for pete's sake - $250 is sheer insanity. I ordered in lilac (received the crystal blue- no big deal, but still!). I read many of the reviews and wasn't too terribly concerned about the wrinkling issues since my concern is softness - period. However, wrinkle factor with these sheets is so extreme as to be almost funny; shrinkage is massive (after two washings, bottom sheet barely fits at all and i'll be tossing them out after 5 washings, would imagine). Biggest complaint is that, at least to me, they're truly NOT all that soft. As a matter of fact they feel more like a bizarre sort of denim to me...they did arrive quickly, though!"
4,Pleasant collection,"Nice selection of Pickford films.Be aware that these films are also included in the ""Silent Cinema 3 disc collection"" so, if you buy that one, don't make the same mistake I did and buy this one as well."
2,There are better performances out there,"A young conductor trying to impress beyondhis capabilites, not a new thing. There areindeed far more intense performances out there.The sound is good. No, I am not impress."
2,a bit rushed,"His timing was a bit rushed in this production. It would work on an electric guitar, but I think an orchestra needs a little more finesse."
5,Not just another Beethoven's 5th,"Even Dudamel said there are thousands of recordings of Beethoven's 5th. Oh, but this one: When you combine Dudamel's extraordinary talent with the amazing Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra, the energy results in an exciting listening experience. I look forward to more from Dudamel in his new role as conductor of the LA Philharmonic in 2009."
2,"Good, but there are too many bands that are just ""good""...","The Watchmen seem to be moving backwards, rather than forwards. While albums such as ""In The Trees"" seemed progressive and original, this album seems to fall into a sort of repitition. Buy it only if you are a longtime dedicated fan, for if you aren't, you won't find anything you haven't heard already"
2,Buy for Flesh and Blood,"The Chaney fan will probably already have most of these films on authorized editions elsewhere, but you probably wont have Flesh and Blood, this set is merely worth it to pick up this title, as far as I know this is the only dvd available with Flesh and Blood on it, if you do not have the Trap either this is a good place to grab this film as well, The Trap is also avaiable through Alpha Video and is most likely the same print as this. So if you dont have either of these Chaney rarities then this set is worth it, but only buy this set for those two films, Buy the other more well known titles on the authorized editions they are worth the extra money for better transfers."
3,Kirk and the Klingons go to meet a god.,This is one of the original Star Trek Novels first put out by Bantam in 1979. It does not follow the same formula length that the Pocket books maintain.The original Bantam series is a bit rarer than the Pocket novels of today. They are a reasonable next generation avenue of reading for the Star Trek fan.
2,Poor.,"The 1950s arrangements MURDER the pep and vitality of the DeSylva, Brown & Henderson's 1920s song catalogue. A massacre.."
3,BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE,"THIS ALBUMN DOESN'T HAVE GOOD SOUND; IT IS A DOUBLE ALBUMN ALL ON ONE SIDE TAKEN FROM PREVIOUS ALBUMNS. THE BEST PART OF IT IS THE MOVIE SONGS WHICH IS AT THE VERY END, SOUND QUALITY BETTER.I GAVE IT 3 STARS."
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried installing this drive on a 6-month old Sony VAIO notebook, and I couldn't write a single CD out of a dozen. I looked at everything on their web site, and all the documentation on the supplied CD-Rom. Couldn't figure out what was going on. Finally found some tiny small-print on the box (and nowhere else is this mentioned) -> it will only support Windows 98SE or ME, if and only if you have an Adaptec USB host controller card. My VAIO has a generic card, so it's a no-go."
3,"an ok camera, only one con so far","only one con i am not satisfied, it is that 3 inch touch screen, although it is big and touchable, brings a lot of fun and convenience to users, but this screen is very glary, on a shinny outdoor environment, it is very hard to see things on the screen, you almost won't be able to see anything, so actually when I took photos outdoor, I was just holding the camera and aimed to the direction where i wanted to take photos and pressed the button, no way to know if the camera aimed to the right thing. they should make this screen free of glare. other than that, all is fine."
2,Poor development,The screen is excellent but is to hard to focus with this camera. It is to sloow to take a picture and the zoom really sucks
4,MySQL Reference,"This is simply the printed version of the online documentation. This is very handy to have when you are not in front of your keyboard. I use the printed and online versions equally. The layout of the printed version is not the best by any means. Used in conjunction with the online documentation, you will find what you need though. This book should be on any PHP/MySQL programmer's shelf."
1,drips water everywhere,"Please be careful if you buy this. I wanted to use this but I found mine to be so flimsy. As soon as I placed water in it, it dripped EVERYWHERE!"
3,Dripping Water Dispenser,The Hello Kitty Water Dispenser sure is cute but it is still a toy. It is not meant to be in high traffic areas because it is not really stable. But the most annoying part is the constant leaking. I feel like its wasting water faster than I drink it. Mine's leaks from the spout and overflows the water catcher under it within the day. This might be better if you put it out on your patio to refresh the kids though.
4,Great for Young Kids,"My daughter loves hers, BUT she made the mistake of putting something warm in it. Because it is flimsy, it warped the bottle. We did not know how to replace the bottle (which would be nice, anyway), so I'm buying her another one. It's a great way to get your child(ren)to drink water, especially if you add cold, mountain spring water to it!PS If you aren't keeping it in the kitchen, do not allow lemonade, etc., as they might not remember to wash it!"
3,No complaints from the recipient as yet,WHO:I bought this for my 10 year old step daughter a few years agoPROS:I have not had any feedback as yet so if she still even has it I'm sure it's fineCONS:No complaints as yet so I guess it fulfilled it's purpose.
3,Yet another point of view,"Mr. De Camp seems to have an agenda of his own, notwithstanding his disclaimer that Mr. Montgomery turned him around. To dismiss Felix Frankfurter and John Dos Passo among dozens of other luminaries as ""members of the chattering classes"" is to display one's own bias. I have read widely in the case, have formed no conclusion as to their guilt or innocence, but am absolutely convinced that they did not receive a fair trial."
2,"""Large"" may be exaggerating a bit","I tried this so-called ""large"" case for my Mossberg 500A. The gun fit pretty snugly, but it did fit. But adding a sidesaddle made the case practically impossible to close; I can force the zipper past the bulge, but the case becomes distorted and strained, and probably wouldn't last through too many openings and closings. If you have absolutely no add-ons (sidesaddle, scope, red dot sight, flashlight, etc.) then this will probably fit your gun. If you have anything extra on it, go with something bigger."
5,A very brief cautionary tale for Cory-cat owners,"Greetings....this is probably the best book that you will ever read, about these wonderful cute little fish! BUT...Please note: if you have these fish in your home aquarium, make sure the cover of your aquarium is fitted so your fish cannot jump out! Cory-cats are prone to jumping and they can escape out of the smallest gap in your tank lid! Buy this book so that you may learn all about the many different kinds of miniature catfish, because they make lovely pets....Happy fishkeeping! ;>)"
5,Fascinating and Helpful Book,"I got this book, The Myth of Sanity, because I was curious about the personality changes I see sometimes in a friend of mine. I couldn't put the book down. I read it cover to cover. I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY, and I don't usually recommend books."
5,A definite must on everyone's book list!,"Seeing as there are already some quite engaging reviews on this incredible book I will keep mine short and sweet. Myth of Sanity was one of the first book's that I read dealing with dissociation, trauma, and fragmented consciousness and find it to be an invaluable resource to anyone who; feel's distant from other people, is prone to daydreaming, has trouble interacting with other people, is known to flip a switch, over or underreacts to different situations, and doesn't feel 'all there'.She discusses all this and more and offer's ways of overcoming these barriers to being active participants in life and helping us to break through the barriers of the grey midlife so many of us inhabit on a daily basis."
5,Worth the read,Excellently written and informative for the professional or lay person who wishes to learn more about dissociative disorders. Have been a Psychotherapist for over 20 years and still learned things from the author's explanatory talent concerning the workings of the brain.
3,Interesting; but deceptive front cover.,"From the title and cover of the book it is supposed to be about Multiple Personality Disorder, but really she takes it mostly in another direction - that of analyzing the various dissociative states common in people, such as driving to your destination and not even being aware of the drive cause you were deep in thought. As for the cases of Multiple Personality she actually quoted, one she said did not meet the qualifications for Multiple Personality Disorder, and all the ones she quoted the information about them was pretty generalized. In general I found this book to be a disappointment. I have read (much) better books on this subject than this book."
2,The Myth of Sanity,"I really liked Martha's other book, The Sociopath next door, but this one was a snoozer. I got as far as her hypnotizing one of her patients it took several pages and was mind numbingly boring she wrote every single word she said to hypnotize her patient like it was a ""how to"" book. I tried reading a few more pages after that but it didn't improve so I quit. It might have gotten better at some point but I just couldn't get there."
2,Not what I expected.,"I bought this book thinking it would give me some great insight into how people think/act, etc. but was really disappointed.The author mostly talks about her client caseloads and hypnosis; which in a clinical way I'm sure is enlightening. However; for the average reader, you will be bored beyond tears trying to gleen even a tiny bit of usable information.I gave up halfway through the book and turned it in to my local book trader."
5,a great book for understanding yourself and others.,"A great author! Written clearly. Has great examples and explanations to help you understand people in general, as well as yourself."
5,Excellent!,This resource is an excellent guide for pastors and congregations that are about to or have called a new pastor. Oswald's images of what ministry looks like over the first few months of ministry (i.e. being a lover and a historian) are vital guides for pastor and people. Highly suggested.
4,VERY GOOD,"I HAD A USED SEAR KOHLER TRACTOR, AND SWITCHED TO MULCHING TRACTOR WITH THIS MULCHING KIT, RECIEVED ON RIGHT TIME, FIT PERFECTLY AND EASILY WITH OUT ANY PROBLEM, WORK VERY GOOD, WORTH EVERY PENNY,"
5,great product,I was looking at the same product at lowes checked amazon and it was priced $10 less and didn't have to drive the 60 mile round trip to the store.I ordered it and was very suprised how easy it was to install also impressed with how the cover that came with it fits perfect over the discharge opening of the deck.
2,Missing parts,"Ordered from amazon, arrived and interior box had already been ripped open, blades did not look used so I installed them, then I started to install the mulch cover. 3 missing parts. Amazon only allows you to return the whole thing, no option for them to ship the 2 nuts and spacer...I don't want to take the blades back off so I'm stuck jury rigging a ""brand new"" item...frustrating"
2,POR IS BETTER,"I LIKE THE POR PRODUCTS BETTER THAN THIS , PLUS IT TOOK TO LONG TO GET HERE. LIVE & LEARN ??????"
4,Works very well,It does what it states which is fair better than most products. It was used on the restoration of a pontoon boat project.
1,unimpressed,"I followed directions,preped the surface, applied two coats and within two weeks the surface is begining to discolor (rust red). This product is all boast, do not waste your time,effort or money."
2,Half good...,"I read this book quite some time ago, but I remember I liked the more factual background information more than the author trying to take us in the lives of four different sorority sisters. Some of the material was very disturbing, but I'm not sure how good of a representation the main girl's sororities are of sororities at large. Not great, but not terrible either."
3,"Very interesting, a good and informative read","I have come to Boston from Argentina, where no one knows what a sorority is, and I am now happy that I have not joined one, after reading this book. It was very informative and easy to read.This book made me want to read her other book on the secret societies of Yale."
2,Just More Stereotypes,"As a senior undergrad in one of the top 5 international sororities, I have to say I was disgusted by the book. Not only were sacred rituals and hundreds of years of traditions treated as meaningless, the author latches on to the already well known stereotypes of sorority women: sexually easy, eating disorder impaired, academic failures, etc. What did ""Pledged"" offer that prejudice and a lack of understanding haven't already? My sorority doesn't fit the supposed trend at all, as we are as diverse as the campus and do not haze in any way, shape or form. I was very letdown by the book and think it is only going to cause more confusion over what Greek Life is from an outsider's point of view versus what Greek Life is from an insider's point of view."
2,"Fun book, but not worth the hype","I enjoyed reading this book and found it to be reasonably accurate. However, as others have stated, there's nothing really new here. So, ""general"" (i.e. white) sororities are shallow and not every member is happy or friends with every other member in her chapter. Sororities are more about partying than they are about service. We all knew this going in.The bigger problem I had with the book was the author. Robbins' style and tone were not even remotely ""unbiased"" or objective. She seriously had it in for these sororities and greek life in general. Yet she also had a vague sense of idolizing them and wanting to fit in with the sisters (check out the part where she describes herself as passing for a college student friend of the girls.) It just seemed like she had some issues of her own to work out."
1,This book is trash,"I was totally offended by this book. I was in a sorority in college from '88 to '91. I can tell you it was NOTHING like the one in the book. Many of my friends, past and present, were in sororities and had the same experience that I did. I still keep up with some of my sisters from college. I met my husband through one of my pledge sisters. My sorority gave me contacts when I graduated college to find a job. I would be a fool to think some of the things that went on in this book don't happen- drinking, hazing, stealing boyfriends, etc. But not to the degree that Robbins' picture paints! If you were not in a sorority, PLEASE don't think this is how Greek life really is. If you were Greek or plan to go through rush, ignore what is said in this book. I can tell you first hand that this is not the way Greek life usually is."
2,Bias hidden behind a veil of neutrality,"Throughout the book, Alexandra Robbins tries to stress that she is attempting to provide readers with an unbiased perspective of sorority (and greek) life on college campuses. However, it is clear that Robbins has deep-seated feelings of negativity towards sororities and this book has been created more to air those than provide a reader with a fair view of organizations she covers. I would argue the only thing she presents with a neutral perspective is the positive aspects of sorority life whereas any shred of negativity is emphasized and explored. Most sections in the book also end on a negative note. Also, the fact that Robbins has absolutely no in-depth understanding of how a greek organization works is painfully obvious to those of us who do.This book is same biased garbage that everyone else is peddling about the greek system. If you actually want to learn more about being greek or how to affect real change in the system, look elsewhere."
2,Kind of boring,"I've read a lot of books about fraternities, so I thought I would give this one a shot. After reading the whole thing, I read the book description again and laughed. Here is what it says:The sordid behavior of sorority girls exceeded her worst expectations -- drugs, psychological abuse, extreme promiscuity, racism, violence, and rampant eating disorders are just a few of the problems. But even more surprising was the fact that these abuses were inflicted and endured by intelligent, successful, and attractive women.Let me warn you that Robbins doesn't come close to even scratching the surface of what it really happening on campus. The wild stories I could tell you would make Pledged seem like a children's story. Robbins just doesn't succeed in exposing the wild and crazy behaviors of college students. Maybe this is because her main characters are all females or maybe the college campus where this story takes place is much tamer than my school."
4,Never was Greek but....,"I enjoyed reading this book, through reading it I kept in mind that some of these events probably only happen in a few chapters throughout the US. However, it does happen. I never belonged to a sorority, but I had two friends belong to them, they loved their sisters and said the good things that happened in the sorority far outweighed the bad. And that's how I felt when i read the book, there were some bad things writen, but all the good things, parties, fundraising, the closeness the girls shard...far outweighed the bad things. I mean seriously, put just 20 girls in a house and don't see if you have these kinds of issues Greek or not. It's part of life, and it doesn't mean that you have to get defensive about it.I highly recommend this book. And if i have a daughter who would choose to join a sorority, I would highly encourage her, even after reading this book."
5,Sorority Girl Entertainment,"As a sorority girl myself, I found the book to be an entertaining read. Having read the book prior to going through recruitment 6 years ago, it did make me more nervous and anxious then need be. I would not recommend anyone to read it prior to the recruitment process as the book's stories are generally based off of old sorority ways and not the new regulations that govern sorority life today. The book is definitely a throw back to old sorority life, not so much how sororities are today, but knowing Greek life inside and out it was interesting and fun to read. I would definitively recommend it, but take it with a grain of salt!"
2,Girls Gone Wild - The College Years,"When I -- who went to a university with no frats/sororities --received this book I had expected a legitimate examination of sorority life but the reality is that I was presented with a hit piece. I don't think anyone is going to deny that some -- perhaps even most -- sororities have their problems but the world that Robbins sketches for the reader is so distorted that you have to wonder what animus she has for them.I was also particularly appalled that she would reveal the secret handshakes, rituals and slogans of several sororities. That's just disrespectful to the people who hold these harmless things dear."
3,Whew!,"I found this book a little lenghty and repetitive at times, and kind of boring as it was not the ""shocker"" of a story I was hoping for. Basically this book just confirmed my assumptions about sororities and made me ever more relieved that my school did not have a Greek system. I can't imagine subjecting myself to all that criticism and peer pressure in college of all places. I left all of that behind in Junior High."
1,A disappointment,"I feel as though someone invaded my home and wrote about it. Actually that was my home during my college years and no matter how well some critics think it was written, it was an invasion of privacy of life that should not have been done. I hope any young girls who may happen to read this don't let it make them rule out sorority life in college. It can be one of the best experiences of your life. I was not one of the stereotypical sorority members. My sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, did not participate in any hazing activity. We were treated with dignity and as a member of the family. What a wonderful place I lived in college. I am disappointed in this book."
2,Borderline,"In terms of scholarly writing this volume lacks sorely. The editing, syntax and sentence structure are awkward (sorry Mr. Robbins). The content is an even mix of sensationalism and titilation to sell books, and an insight into some sorority culture.An important read, albeit boring, for guidance counselors (like me), high school student parents (also like me) and , perhaps, mature college-bound girls.Not bad, but not good (sorry Ms. Robbins)."
1,A close-minded horrible book!!,"The author is an older woman, who never being in a sorority and not understanding ANYTHING about it, tries to uncover the ""deep dark secrets of sorority life."" If you are a sorority girl looking for an interesting read, this isn't for you. She describes the girls as alcoholics who randomly sleep around. If you interview any college age girl.. most of these things would be an issue for them too. The author sounds like she was trying to perpetuate the stereotypes that already hinder sorotities recruitment. There are many faults in the greek system, but none that aren't present in the society as a whole."
1,This book does not even deserve the one star...,"This book was awful. I couldn't even bring myself to read the last chapters of the book. I don't suggest this to anyone trying to get an ""unbiased"" view of the greek system because it's quite obvious the author is biased. There's no way not to be. Plain and simple, either you are Greek or you're not - and the author is not (THANK GOD!!!) This book was boring, and it focused on the things and ways to put down Greeks. For those considering reading this because you are thinking of joining a sorority, I would recommend against it. This book was the biggest waste of my money. It was just not an accurate portrayal of Greek life."
4,A well-written glimpse into sorority life,"You'll notice most of the reviewers below complain about this book not because of the way it was written, but because of what it says. Robbins does exactly what she says she is going to do--present the lives of a few sorority girls as they happened. No more, no less. This book may or may not be a good indicator of what life is like for countless other sorority girls in the countrty, but that is not the purpose here. If you have personal experiences with a sorority that you found to be different from those told in this book, that's probably a good thing. Count yourself lucky. This author does a pretty good job of presenting these women exactly as they are. It is up to the reader to judge who or what made them that way."
4,Depends what you want out of it,"I don't think Alexandra wants us to believe this is the utlimate description of sororities, she is not that dumb. She wanted to show what it was like in the sororities she mentioned. She is not trying to speculate of other ones that she had not visited. Her book was entertaining and none of it was made up. The things that happened in the book are real and therefore gripping. I would suggest reading it."
3,Interesting Analysis of Greek Life,"Robbins undertakes a complex investigative project in Pledges: The Secret Life of Sororities. The book gives an equal amount of historical information with accounts of sorority women. While the stories do seem to be out of a 90210 episode, the inside look at the lives, experiences, and rituals of the Greek system is intriguing. This is a interesting work of non-fiction and is written fairly well. It is an easy, fast read, and skims the surface about African-American Greek life, societal impact, and other deeper topics. If you are interested in the interior lives of sorority houses, this book hits its target. Robbins also has a website where the lives chronicled in the book are continued."
1,Bored to sleep,"This book lacked any real insight into what is going on in sororities. The author continually mentions how she was trying to be fair in how she depicted the girls. It seemed to me she left a lot out, just to be friends with these people once the book was written. I could only get through a few pages at a time before getting bored. If you want an insight into sorority life and how the girls really are, I would look elsewhere."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could-- hugely disappointing,"What a disappointment! I'm really shocked by how negative, one-sided and poorly presented this book is.I picked up Pledged thinking it might be an interesting, if somewhat critical look at sorority life. However, it turned out to be just an outright indictment of the Greek system, without any reasonable discussion of its benefits. There was no balance to it whatsoever, as if the author had decided what she wanted to write before embarking on any research and then only looked for antecdotes that would back up her pre-existing idea that sororities are bad for women. That's just really amateurish writing. And it created a book that has little to offer the reader other than horror stories.I'm really disappointed in Pledged, because I was very curious to read about this subject. Unfortunately, the book is not terribly informative and somewhat hysterical in tone."
5,this book is HOT,"u know a book is hot when u get messedup reviews like the one from New Haven, who obviously is either someone who personally knew Miss Robbins and is bitter (this one is my guess), a sorority chick who is bitter because Pledged revealed her secret password, or a writer who is bitter because she didnt come up with the idea first (tho doubtful because the reviewer doesnt seem to know the correct meanings of narcissism and voyeruism). First of all voyeurism is the most fun kind of book to read, second of all ive only read Pledged but from the descriptions Miss Robbins other books dont seem voyeuristic, and third of all if a reviewer feels so heated about this book that she has to call the author names then if i hadnt read Pledged already id want to read it even more.So heres a real review: Pledged is a hot book and ive never read anything like it, with characters who i care about who are actually real ppl. other ppls bitterness mean this book is even more important than i thought"
1,Pitiful,"Ms. Robbins does nothing more than re-state tired stereotypes without a sufficient amount of supporting data. It is certainly no expose of the Greek system.From university to university, student organizations vary. Behavior of college students is relatively consistent regardless of membership in sororities or fraternities. There is nothing mystical about it.Unfortunately, this book does nothing more than make it OK (in the eyes of some) to ostracize a particular group of people. We need more of this?Perhaps Ms. Robbins has a personal axe to grind with an organization..."
2,"Nothing new--happens at any college, in dorms or in frats/soros","I picked up this book in a half-price bin at Powell's in Portland. In the end, I had to laugh, because the sex, drugs, and rock n roll she describes in the sororities is nothing new. Heck, every DORM at the Pacific Northwest school I attended was full of sex, booze, drugs, and partying too--you didn't need to join the Greek system to pass out drunk every weekend! The point is, is it any shock that college-age girls are drinking and having sex while in the Greek system? Of course not. Therefore, the whole book is anti-climatic. This stuff is happening in high school. College? Big deal. Partying is half the reason why you go to college for! There's a famous saying: ""Want an education? Go to a library. Want to party? Go to college."" 350+ pages on something we all know is going on. Pfft."
2,Not well integrated,"The title and concept of ""Pledged"" had me hooked from the start. But I found Alexandra Robbings book plagued with problems. It's unclear exactly what her role is the in sorority or how she got there--friend of all these girls, living in the house as a sister, or house mom--the readers don't know. While her relationships with the girls she follows seem to be solid, her transcripts, which claim to be accurate, sound suspect. Additionally, Ms. Robbins opens each chapter with quotes from sorority handbooks from the past 100 years and the girls' IM away messages. These quotes are not well integrated into the story she weaves; they don't seem to have much to do with the content of the chapters.Overall, not a bad read. Ms. Robbins needs to further develop her writing skills before I will purchase another one of her books, though."
1,Betsey Rae,Betsey Rae shouldn't believe everything she reads! If you haven't lived Greek life you don't know that the book is a true portrayal. Those of us who have and don't agree are only expressing so. Many of us did not have the experiences written in the book.
1,BORING,"I ended up just scanning the pages looking for useful information. I was in a sorority for 4 years, and I did not find much of the information even relevant."
1,A big disappointment,"What a bunch of tripe!I was prepared to read a book about the secret life of sororities only to find urban legend after urban legend printed as if it were true. I was very disappointed.I guess the key here is that anyone can take a bunch of urban legends, claim they followed 4 fictional people through it, and claim it was real.Heck, maybe I should write a book. Anyone want to hear about my four friends who picked up an exploding cactus and chihuahua while in Mexico? It's true... really! They told me all about it."
1,Disgusted,"I am beyond disgusted. Truely. As a member of an NPC Sorority never in my LIFE have I heard or seen anything described in the few blurbs I've read of the book. Robbins obviously does not know how to research correctly because her use of words like ""pledges"" is out dated and no longer allowed to be used. There many greeks in many high positions; almost all of our Presidents have been greek, congressmen and women and many many other high profiled individuals. None of us appreciate being slandered and stereotyped in such ways."
1,This Author is a Psychopathic Narcissist,"Voyeurism her main motive in every one of her ""literary"" works, Miss Robbins knows what grabs, what sells. This Yalie brat panders to an audience in a way which is provocative, at best, and which will make her a rich little witch-with-a-""B"" ASAP, by means of a pseudoliterary style most appropriately labelled ALL HEAT AND NO LIGHT.More might be learned by perusing the latest Bazooka Bubble Gum Comic Wrappers...in Hebrew. Don't waste your shekels here, girls!"
1,jealous broad,This book just shows how this woman has nothing better to do with her time. I am highly dissappointed how she would stereotype all sororities based off just a few.Sororites and Fraternities have the highest statistics of successful men and women.I have been in a sorority since I started college and never once has their been any hazing or mental/physical abuse.If this ever happened we would lose our house and worse our charter. We appreciate and realize being in a sorority is a privledge and not all people can handle the pressure of sorority and school at the same time.I find it disrespectful that anyone would expose some of these sororities secrets.These secrets she exposed about ritual and other sacred stuff is crossing the line.This woman deserves to be sued.She violated the rights of these women.
1,This is not an accurate representation of Sorotities across the U.S.,"I am a member of sorority and I can tell you that this book does not accurately portray our organizations. It plays into stereotypes and is very one-sided. I was extremely offended by the Publisher's Weekly review that claimed, ""Historically black sororities... do have a reputation for promoting community service and sisterhood; ""historically white"" sororities.. are really just social groups for making friends and meeting guys, despite their claims to academic and service values."" I found this claim to be very racist and stereotypical, my sorority participates in plenty of service oppurtunities and we have high academic expectations."
3,Pledged Book Review,"I really liked learning about the things that go on in sororities. I enjoyed reading about the lives of the 4 girls that Alexandra Robbins focused on. Although, I found the explanations in between some of the stories to be a little boring. It was interesting to see what happened to the girls throughout the year, and I liked that part of the book, but as soon as she started going into those long explanations about sororities, I found myself losing interest. However, I do think Alexandra Robbins did a great job researching and finding out about the life behind sorority walls."
1,Not even well written,"I read this as a greek woman who does not consider herself ""the typical greek"". Which means that if you asked every person in my life if they thought I would ""go greek"", every person would say with 100% certainty that I would remain indepedent. With all that being said, I picked up this book for a good light read about a world that I myself sometimes do not feel completely comfortable in. The book was terrible, I had to push myself to finish it because all of the characters were so flat and unlikeable and the writing was so green. Most people will read this book because of the back cover summary and the close up of the pledge's chests in their P.U.'s (personal undergarments) on the front. If you have to read it, borrow a friends copy or from the library - please don't reward this author."
1,Bias and poorly written,"I was very excited to read this book, thinking it would be well-researched and give an accurate picture of Sorority life. Sadly, it doesn't. All the bad things that happen in this book do not happen because the girls joined a sorority, it happened because they were in college. Every college, regardless of having a Greek system experiences drug abuse, eating disorders, date rape, etc. Statistically, in a group of 100 young women these things are going to exist, not simply because they belong to a certain organization. I hope readers realize that this book is more about college life than sorority life."
1,Yellow journalism at its worst,"I would forewarn any worried parents of college-bound girls that this book is far more sensationalist than the critics urging you to read it would let on. The paperback version begins with a convenient dismissal of any would-be critics, claiming the book to be an objective, outsiders' account of what occurs when the typical girl joins a sorority. And it may be a true description of Alexandra Robbins' narrow field study, but it is nothing more than that - a glimpse of two specific sororities on one anonymized campus. There are many Greek systems across the country who do not approach the lewd behavior described on these pages. It is apparent that Ms. Robbins' motives for penning this diatribe are less than pure; I would have been severely penalized by my journalism professors for writing a piece of any length with such skew. Just take it with a grain of salt - and be advised that it's not especially well-written."
4,A vivid and real depiction of sororities,"As an alumnus of one of the nation's largest national sororities -- and one of the nation's largest greek systems I was, needless to say, very interested in Robbins' book.I picked it up Saturday and didn't put it down until Sunday. What we have here is not only a very real, fair and balanced depiction of sorority life, but a very honest story about four girls trying to find out who they really are in the chaos that is college.I have no doubt that sisters from all over the country will boycott this book -- but in the end Robbins' doesn't support or refute sorority life -- she merely gives us an outsiders view into the lives many of us led or are currently leading."
2,Not Realistic,"This book, while it claims to seek out the non-stereotypical girls, was the most stereotyped book I've ever read. It was almost painful to read, much like reading a textbook. I realize that it was ""researched"", but there are different ways to write it so it doesn't sound so dull. Never, in all my experience as a Greek woman, have I seen, heard of, or been privy to anything like what was described. I went to a large southern school, and hazing and drugs ARE NOT allowed. Period. The end. Real girls are not allowed to behave in this way, and if they do, they are put on probation.I feel like the outsider looking in approach was not the way to go here. Because you don't see the retreats, the chapter meetings, or any of the sisterhood ties that are there. You only see the surface, and what's on the surface can be twisted and misconstrued."
4,Interesting,"An interesting expose of Greek Life in American colleges. Robbins was very fair in her report, revealing both the good and the bad of sororities."
1,Secret Life of Scroll and Key,"Apalling. As I read this I am amazed to see how the author gladly gives away secrets of what is supposed to be a secret organization. She claims not to be anti-sorority, yet she looks at everything, from sorority tshirts to key chains, with utter disgust and snobbery.What some people may not realize is that the author herself was a member of a secret society at Yale. You would think she would understand the value of secrecy. Someone should write an expose on Alexandra Robbins and the Scroll and Key society at Yale. I'm sure that someone with her scrupulous unethical behavior would have a few shockers of her own.For a much more accurate account, pick up ""Be my sorority sister."""
1,Why Do People Write and Read This Stuff?,"I've been involved with my college sorority for over 20 years. Sororities provided a wonderful experience in college and beyond. Some of my lifelong friendships were formed through sorority. If you are looking for a place which fosters sisterhood, fraternity and bonding then try a sorority. If it is not for you -- stay away."
1,pledged...,"As a member of a sorority in the NPC, I was appalled that this woman was allowed to release private information about these orgainzations. I couldn't even bring myself to read the entire book because I was so disappointed that she misrepresented the greek system as a whole. I cannot believe that one person could attack something that has existed for over 100 years, and has thrived as part of college life. I hope that she is proud of herself for releasing secrets into the public, and making sororities look like nothing more than a bunch of girls with eating disorders, and sex, drug and alcohol problems"
1,This woman is jumping to conclusions...BIG TIME!,"You can't judge every sorority by the actions of a few girls! Every greek letter organization is different, I can't speak for anyone else, but I am an active member of a well known sorority and I have NEVER seen one of the problems that the author refers to in her book! Going Greek has been the most positive experience of my life and I think it is horrible that this woman is putting such a negative spin on something she truly knows NOTHING about."
2,Seemed a bit fabricated,"The book is captivating, but I couldn't finish it because it jumped all over the place. I pledged a well-known, national sorority in Texas and girls were catty, but not as bad as the book makes them sound. If anyone acted out of line, they were dealt with by a Standards committee. I pledged 14 years ago, so if this is how sorority girls are behaving now, I am horrified!!"
2,The not so secret life,"I was foolishly disappointed with this book, even though I knew when I picked it up that it wouldn't be a ""serious"" read. It is not a brilliant exposé fit for the New York Times - it is more like the book version of an E! Entertainment documentary. Robbins writes about four sorority girls and uses a very fictionalized style to tell their stories (as opposed to a documentary/interview style), which I didn't care for. Frankly, if one wants to read college fiction, there are far better books out there. I would have appreciated more of a journalist's detachment and objective eye.And as for the whole undercover angle - it's not done too well. Nothing remarkably secret is revealed, no new truths uncovered - the observations in the book could be made by any college student. Also, the sorority behaviour is in no way exclusive to sororities. Many high school and college youths behave like the ones in the book, Greek life or no."
1,not accurate,"While an interesting read, I did not feel that this book was an accurate portrayal of sorority life. Yes, I am sure that there are some sororities like those in the book (obviously, or it would not have been written) but there are many more with so much to offer. I am a member of a sorority at a public university, and I have never experienced any sort of hazing. (After rush the executive board actually told us that an active member was not even allowed to ask us to pick up a dropped pencil!) I am also a Christian, and not once have I been pressured to go against my beliefs (getting drunk, dressing provocativly, etc).Please do not base your opinion of sororities on this book!! Do some research and most importantly, find sorority members at the school you are interested in and ask them questions! Do not base your opinion of a sorority as a whole on one person and remember that we are human just like everyone else!"
2,Nuthin but fluff....,"Was funny, but not very realistic. As a recent college grad and fraternity man who worked closely with NPC groups on my campus, it all seems too far fetched. I never saw any of the things Ms Robbins noted. (of course I wasnt privy to the most secret aspects of house and sorority life.) Even if some of those things were true, hows it different from your avg 25-30 year old woman who's all about making connections and spending $ on herself. If Ms. Robbins really wanted to write an expose from the inside, she shoulda just joined as an undergrad. Then she really would have had the proper perspective (not some 30+ something trying to fit in and write about a bunch of 18-22 year olds.) Maybe she just should have written about the exciting scandals of a Journalsm Department at her alma mater. Oh wait, becasue it would be boring and wouldnt sell. Remember, its all about selling books, truth be darned. I read that the movie rights just got optioned on this."
1,not always the case,"i have read this and to tell you the truth not all sororities are like that and i would know I am a current sorority member and have been a me,ber of this sorority on 2 seperate campuses in two different areas of the country , one in Kentucky and currently i am at Iowa State. I have NEVER expirienced any form of hazing or have been pushed into dieting drinking excetera. i think that it is sad that sororities are given such a bad rap because from all the girls i know and the colleges i have been to it is so much a wonderful expirience of service and sisterhood. So dont take this book as the complete truth because there are us good sororities out there."
2,A bit biased,"I was hoping to read a fair and biased report on the activities of sororities, but was disappointed to find that the author was very biased in her opinions and didn't really show the opposite (not quite so dark) side of sororities. Also, the reading was a bit choppy due to the fact that the girls' stories were than ""analyzed"" by the author with information about similar events, facts, etc."
1,upset,"Well, I personally found this book to be horribly untrue. I am not a Greek, but I have many friends who are and just seeing something demeaning to these girls has made me very upset. It just ingrains another bad image of sorority-life into the public's mind. Besides the fact that I do not know any sorority girl who does any of the ""astonishing"" things written in the book, the bok also uncovers ritual, which although may seem ""dumb"" to some people, it is very important to these people as a family tradition is to some of us. Also, sororities are not all about the social life; sorority girls and fraternity men account as the largest volunteer organization in this country. Personally, this book apalled me and I did not even have to be in a sorority to feel this way."
1,poorly researched and written,"I was so disappointed with this book, which I found to be out of date. It listed the incorrect information for several rituals, which made me think the author went by rumor instead of personal experience. You can't base a book on rumor and call yourself simply a reporter. If you were wondering if you should purchase the book, just look at the bibliography of sources. If they are over 20 years old or web chat rooms, it is clear this author is just trying to make a quick buck off anyone who will buy it. Completely disappointing and a waste of money."
4,"Its about reporting the women's Greek life, mommyschool","What the reviewer (mommyschool) failed to appreciate was that the book is written to expose. To imply that the journalist involved is also morally required to solve each and every problem (or even any of them) she comes into contact is completely bull-headed.The question can then be asked: as you seem to accept that Alexandra Robbins did witness these exeriences and that they are predominant in Greek life, what have YOU (mommyschool) done to correct/expose similar problems at your local sorority? How do YOU propose Robbins protect herself from libel suits, if she were to publically name the school in question?It does not surprise me that some reviewers take issue with what others haven't done properly, but don't accept the responsibility of seeking out these same problems themselves and then 'fixing' them."
2,"Thoughts of a new ""pledge""","Unlike some poor reviews, I actually read this book.Unsurprisingly, as a new sorority sister I frown upon it. Not just upon Robbins' clearly bias reports from disgruntled greek women, but of her intentions in writing the book.It is entirely unethical for Robbins to publish private sorority secrets; that is a mark against feminism itself. The secrets represent the foundations of centuries of female bonding and empowerment.I applaud Robbins for opening a nationwide discussion on such unsightly topics as rape and drug use within the greek community, but it is not a balanced one. There is an upside for every downside, and usually a bright one. I have spoken with dozens of greek women who credit their house as the reason they stayed in college rather than fall into a lazy dorm routine and drop out.I recommend that women considering rushing greek life speak with women who have been in the system RATHER than read this book as their source of information."
1,Written to exploit Greeks and sell books.,"This book was a quick and easy read, with its tantalizing stories about Greek life: boozing, hooking up, and cutting each other down. Stereotypes exist for a reason, and it appears that Ms. Robbins went in search of proving some of these. I knew many Greeks and non-Greeks, and the problems prevalent in the book were experienced by all of my friends, regardless of any affiliation they had with a social club or fraternity. Its sad and unfortunate that the Greek system was exploited in this manner so someone could sell a few books."
2,really boring book,"I couldn't finish this book. I found it very difficult to keep my interest. I was never really shocked by anything presented, and could not have cared less about the characters. I think we all know sororities do both good and bad things. It's all politics in the end."
2,A little annoyed by this book,"After being in a sorority for a few years, I feel I have seen the good and the bad of my sorority. But the bad aspects that Ms. Robbin's writes about are a little far fetched. I do believe that some sororities out there (maybe in Texas) are psychologically and emotionally harmful as she states in her book, but not all. And I think that the information she released in her book about rituals was a little upsetting. My advice to anyone thinking about purchasing this book: Please don't assume all sororities are like this. Because they aren't! Especially the ones on my campus. Books like these sort of add to the already rumored ""sorority life"" that is 95% untrue! So when reading this book just keep an open mind and don't assume all sororities are the same! Thank you!"
4,"Interesting, but...","I liked this book. And I admittedly read it in the hopes that it would be the scathing review of the sororities I so loathe. But the book was a little too biased and didn't seem to raise the issues it could have. The chapters begin with a plot of whatever is happening with a few of four girl's lives, which keeps the book interesting, however, the storylines are a detriment to the overall examination of sororities. It sounded like she was being really nitpicky instead of focusing on what the biggest detriments of the Greek System are. There's no crazy rhetorical that smashes down on sororities the way oh, say, I could. So I don't know what the big deal is about people freaking out."
2,Reads more like fiction...,"Obviously this author came into this situation with a negative viewpoint of sororities. However, in the beginning of the book she acts as though she is neutral. The way she writes the book shows her obvious disdain for the Greek System. I was not in a sorority during college (even though it was huge at my university), and I often made fun of my friends who were in the system, just to give them a hard time since I really didn't know what it was all about. I do believe there were some good points to going Greek, though. This book reads like a soap opera transcript, and the writing style is very elementary. If you want to read this book and pretend it's fiction, it's pretty funny. However, if you are looking for a factual, non-biased read, this probably isn't the book you want."
3,"an entertaining summer read, that's all","As a male, ""Pledged"" seemed promising as a means of insight into a world I am far removed from. As a student in an urban university where Greek life is virtually nonexistant, the American sorority and fraternity systems seemed to provide a wealth of secrets and insider-type information that the author might have delved into. Instead, the result was a rather timid account of four average girls experiencing all the same things that I had heard about in other news reports, movies, and yes, the MTV show that the author constantly references. Sadly, Pledged is very middle of the line, not racy enough to be anything truly provocative, nor researched enough to present anything new or unheard of. A descent read, but far from a compelling one."
