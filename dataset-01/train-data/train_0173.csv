1,this movie is like watching something that came FROM HELL,um.......i like johnny depp. I like heather graham. theyre both great actors especially johnny depp. But what in tha hell where they thinking when they stared in this catastrophy of a movie. It doesnt even have the right to be called a movie. The whole movie is some what irrelevant to the infamous Jack the ripper. This is one of the worst movie plots Ive ever seen. Especially when im a fan of Johnny Depp( I like the italian mafia movies he does.)I actually had expectations for this movie...........I was dead wrong
4,Jack the Ripper movie,"Despite what many think, this movie about Jack the Ripper is mainly about the phsycho and his gruesome murders. It tells a very good theory about who the killer really was 110 years ago, and I believe thats the most reasonable solution. Lots of Gore really gets you into the movie and shows how this guy was a extremely violent. The music alone would make a Friday the 13th movie scary."
2,Good premise...Not-so-good outcome.,"This film adaptation by the Hughes Brothers, though cinematically stylish and darkly brooding, runs immediately into predictable territory within the first 10 minutes. The casting itself is passable with Heather Graham, and Depp and Holm have good chemistry together; however, the only truly believable characters were the whores themselves...derelicts of society who use their womanhood as their livelihood- constantly striving for absolution from their sentences to poverty, only receiving it in horrific deaths.The DVD comes full of extras for the die-hard fan (as DVDs should): commentary, featurettes, deleted scenes. In my opinion, however, the ""deleted scenes"" are actually ""deleted shots"" since most last no more than a few seconds.Overall, it's too much of a ""whodunit"" pipe-dream. Ol' Jack would have turned his nose up at a tale that is so uninspired."
2,Lost opportunity,"This looks and sounds wonderful and the performances are top-notch (with the exception of the woefully miscast Robbie Coltrane and Heather Graham). How unfortunate that it's marred by a plodding script which wanders into over-complicated conspiracy theories, and direction which only momentarily rises to the pitch of terror required by the subject. In a genre where anticipation and payoff are the key requirements, interest here is quickly lost. That this film is so close to being good makes it all the more disappointing. Recast a few characters and cut 20 pages from the script, and it would have been a winner."
3,Not a bad film or blu ray!,Not a bad film for what it's worth. The first time through I was maybe expecting more but the blu is worth a purchase.
2,From Hell: It should have stayed there,This was a poor adaptation of a weak theory of who Jack the Ripper really was. It never touched on the other suspects at all.The only original thought that this movie had was that the last victim may not have been Mary Kelly as it is commonly thought to be. Johnny Depp's performance was flat. It seemed like his character was not the only one using ... There was little to no chemistry with Heather Grahmn. I am very glad I did not buy this DVD. It has definately my worst movie list.
1,If only Jack coulda ripped this up,"This film takes the easy way out and uses the theory of government conspiracy covering up royal guilt. That aside, Heather Graham's must have missed her makeup call, what with her pearly white teeth and barely dirtied hair and clothes. Johnny Depp is incomprehensible as he mumbles along and occassionally attempts an accent. Several good character actors are underused. It's a boring mess."
2,Fugettaboutit.,"This movie got boring really quickly. I had literally no interest in the film once the production value had been established. I never had any interest in the Jack the Ripper story, and I do not know. The quote at the beginning is what struck me. It was worth seeing a dipiction of what life was like back then, though only scenery and subtleties could be considered accurate. I was disappointed. It is long too. I'd say pass on this one, even if you have never seen it."
3,"GOOD, BUT IT COULD BE BETTER","I was so excited to see this film, and more when i saw the critics of it.They were great, nobody gave it 1 star.But, when the movie ends i was very disapointed.I'm saying that i didn't like it, just that it could be better.The good things of the film are:-Johnny Depp, he's such a great actor.-Heather Graham, not a talented girl, but very beautiful.-The deads are great, the scalpel really scares you.-It's filmed in a very bueautiful way,-The music is espectacular.So, in closing.From Hell is a very good film, but like I said:-It could be such better.Bye!!!"
3,Slow but well done !,"The acting and filming are very good. Lighting is great.The acting is alright.This movie is quite good.Not historic. It's before all a fiction but the plot is well balanced. The only thing I didn't like is the 2 hours because It's pretty slow moving.For sure don't get this movie because you expect a true story or because you want to be scared.It's more kind of ""investigation & suspense"" movie."
5,I HIGHLY recommend this movie! ! ! ! !,"I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out and I only have one word to say...WOW! This movie was great overall. The acting was great, the murder scenes were awesome, bloody neverthless, and ending was shocking, a very important part of any movie. So I would recommend this movie to anyone who would want to see a movie about Jack the Ripper."
5,Mystery+Suspense+Blood+Superb Acting = A Masterpiece,I fy ou have any interest in Jack The Ripper than you will like this movie. It is based on the book From Hell. Although not all of it is fact it is pretty close to what actually happened. You actually get to see if you like the subject of Jack The Ripper.
3,Disappointing,I've always been fascinated by Jack the Ripper so I figured this movie would be great. Too bad it lacked a strong story and good direction. Sure the imagery is beautiful but the characters are often stiff and lifeless. The story drags on a bit. It moves too slow and the ending is unsatisfying. Johnny Depp does not appear to be the great investigator you'd expect in this movie and Jack the Ripper fails to frighten even the towns people. It's not what I expected.
4,So Good!,"What a great movie! I really enjoyed it. Although some of the language was crass, it was a movie I will watch over and over again!!!OSSlady"
4,From Hell Is Coppolistic...,"The Hughes Brothers turn at recreating the look of Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula and Burton's Sleepy Hollow isn't bad. The cinematography is wonderful and lush. The leads fare well but could have been recast with unknowns or more believable actors. It has a nice easy pacing and creative/modern editing, but it lacks in story. Although, we follow Jack the Ripper anonymously until the end (good choice), I feel that they should have left his character at more of a mystery since no one really knows who he was anyway. Ian Holm is wonderful and his acting is well worthy of the film's dark and and haunting look. The Extra DVD is loaded with cool stuff, including a fascinating look at Absinthe.... ****stars"
5,RIP'S YOUR GUT'S OUT! FIVE STABS ///// OUT OF FIVE /////,"JOHNNY DEPP STANDS OUT IN THIS LUSH CINEMATOGRAPHY, THE PERIOD WAS WELL DEPICTED.DEPP IS A JEWEL AND AUDIENCES CANT HELP BUT LIKE HIS SEDUCTIVE STYLE IN THIS FILM. HE DRAWS THE AUDIENCE IN WITH TYPICAL DEPP, MUCH LIKE HE DRAWS ON HIS OPIUM PIPE.THIS IS A GOOD TAKE ON THE OLD DIABOLICAL THRILLER---AND IS THE BEST JACK THE RIPPER THAT I HAVE SEEN.I FOUND THE SEX SCENES TO BE REALISTICLY GRITTY AND EVOCATIVE OF THAT PERIOD--- WHERE IMMORALITY WAS ON FULL DISPLAY ON THE SIDE STREETS OF LONDON.THE FILM GIVES A GOOD GEOGRAPHIC SCALE TO THE IMMENSE OUTLAY OF LONDON EVEN IN THE 1800'S.I BOUGHT THIS DVD IN THE BARGAIN BIN AND WILL WATCH IT SEVERAL TIMES.I AM A DEVOTEE OF DEPP. HE IS SUCH A GOOD ACTOR, AND HE STRETCHES TO TRY NEW PROJECTS.I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM IN A GOOD BBC/A&E; PRODUCTION OR MASTERPIECE THEATRE."
4,Rejection Junkies,"Had a co-worker share this book with the people in my office, and it is a book I think anyone can relate to and buy to have for reference. You need to read the book to understand what I say, it's one you can read and re-read and keep on hand for future reference. It enlightens you to better understand why we do things and why other people are the way they are. A good read."
4,a novel thesis,"I found this book very readable and intellectually stimulating. The author puts forth a novel and plausible thesis regarding the impact of a racist society on the majority race. A great deal has been written about the effects racism has on the minority, but this writer examines its interplay with the psychology of the racist majority. She puts forth interesting and compelling ideas about the psychic danger, for white children, should they identify with the devalued minority. I found her study thought-provoking and engaging."
1,Bad Scholarship,"Having read this volume twice, I conclude that the author has joined a series of book reports together and ignored primary sources. Having concluded that, the next observation would be that she started with her conclusion and wrote backward. Shame to the writer for such an abuse of scholarship."
1,Barely Disguised Marxist Nonesense,"The thesis. The problem that the majority of Americans face is that working white Americans (i.e. the proletariat) have not shaken their false consciousness, made common cause with blacks of their class to throw off the white capitalist oppressors. If they do, then we can achieve a worker's paradise. Oh, and parents that don't see it this way are engaging in child abuse (and presumably need re-education).It is too bad that trees were sacrificed for such intellectually incoherent, obviously wrong, marxist nonsense."
1,Lousy balance,"The handle is not attached in the right places on this kettle, so when it has water in it it tips to one side. A person can't carry it by the handle like he is supposed to be able to, and if a a person goes to pick up this kettle with more than a quart of water in it, it tips and the water sloshes even more off-balance. Poor manufacturing, but after mail-ordering this, I can't take it back to the store and exchange it for one with better balance (if there is one). I ordered this on Amazon so I wouldn't have to look for it in a dozen stores, but now I wish I hadn't."
5,faith to faith,very inspirational book. also delivery was on time. would use amazon again to purchase from
5,Service from the seller,"The service we received for our purchase of a used book was excellent. The communication between us and the seller was first class. The condition of the used book is very good and as advertised, we have no complaints."
5,this book hits the spot!!,"this book has been a tool that helped guide me thru life with my daily struggles and decisions. it is a good mental reference for me because everything in this book is so positive and on point. it gave me knowledge and wisdom that i could understand and incorperate into my daily life because its seems so real and todate. i read this book years ago and bought it for a friend, just like someone did me, and the person always tells me that they see a bit of me in every page of the book. its amazing how a daily reading tool could not only stick with you but rub off on to others. i offer this book to anyone who is searching for all the good things that influential words can bring. i promise you it wont be a waste."
1,Cengage Advantage Books: Sociology (Paperback),The book was in horrible condition. There was writing and highlighting absolutely everywhere. The front cover and book seemed very mistreated. For the description that was given about I feel like it showed the complete opposite. I was not very satisfied with that purchase.
2,"Sociology, by Jon M. Shepard...","Ok, here is my story with the one used book I purchased that was like... WOW! How could anyone re-sell this?!? But, I am making the best of the situation by taping pages together and trying to ignore ""massively excessive"" and ""totally random"" hi-lighting of text. Honestly, it looks like someone used this for a ""neon-blacklight-happy-time"" coloring book.I guess there's a saying in Latin... something about ""buyer be ware""... so PLEASE learn from my mistake! Thanks :)"
3,Book recieved,I recieved the book in a timely matter especially being that it was a holiday weekend. I recieved my book today but wasn't satisfied at the fact I was told it was in good condition and upon recieving it the covers corners were extremely worn to the point they are shrivaling and peeling apart the cover is curling up and highlighter through it. Definetly would have ordered elsewhere for a little more money to guarntee a better book.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,I had an horrible experience with this seller. I ordered my book and never got it. I e-mailed the seller and was never e-mailed back and I wasn't ever refunded my money either! I strongly advise everyone not to go through these guys!
3,"Good, but not the best...","""Racing After Midnight"" has got to be my least favorite in HMS's discography. It doesn't have as many catchy tunes as ""The Big Prize"" (1986), ""Monsters Under The Bed"" (1991), or their self-titled debut album (1984). This was HMS's last album before they started to change players from the original lineup, and it seems to reflect that in most of this CD's songs. Recommended only for inveterate fans (realistically, I rate this work as 3 1/2 stars)."
4,Not as easy as I thought!,"This system teaches very differently from how I learned Spanish in school. No grammer or sentence scructure in the beginning,(just nouns)and that is how far I am right now. You really have to listen hard to what the voice is saying, then select the right picture. You must practice every day. Hopefully it will click!"
4,Love this program,"I am finding this program great fun. It is beautifully put together and easy to use.The material is presented to accommodate different learning styles and more fun then class for the self motivated.After starting the first unit, I decided to visit Ukraine so I bought a phrase book. I found the phrase book very helpful in decoding all the oddities of the language that were perplexing. I highly recommend Rosetta Stone."
5,How in the world did this band ever slip through the cracks?,"I bought this CD a few months ago based solely on reviews - never heard the music before (except ""Love will Tear Us Apart"") - that they were supposed to sound alot like New Order. After the first listen I determined yeah, they do sound a little like New Order - except better and immediatley became my ""most treasured"" CD. These guys were so far ahead of thier time (probably the only reason they never got any recognition in 1978-1980) the material still sounds fresher than 90% of the stuff released in the past 4 years. I haven't heard any of their other CDs yet, and wonder how ""Closer"" and ""Unknown Pleasures"" stacks up musically to ""Substance"". We'll see ..."
3,never recieved,"all though i never recieved the cd that i ordered, they done an excellent job with customer service. based on that alone i would do business with them again."
1,Disappointed,"This band is recommneded because of New Order, unfortunately New Order is far superior. Unlike most great bands I was not intrigued by theeir early work and it does not have a timeless sound. I greatly enjoy The Cure, Depeche Mode and others from this same era but not Joy Division. New Order fans skip this CD."
5,F Yeah..,"Must own..Dance,Dance,Dance, punk band turning into a new wave one is evident here on this album..I keep Mr. Curtis grave photo in my room, I wore black and danced to (feel the passion..) Transmission, skanked to the third song on side one, and learned to play it (Dance,Dance,Dance,like ""Violent Playground"" by Nitzer Ebb...) on my Base, F'N the third song on side one, get get it out of (..my..) mind..The instrumental song second one on side two..Haunting with ""She's Lost Control Again"" just as much..I'm dancing and depressed and 18 years old again, and this music never dies.."
3,Round-up of non-album tracks,"Perfecly complementing their two essential studio albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, this expanded compilation re-issue rounds up their legendary singles, including Transmission/Novelty, Love Will Tear Us Apart/These Days and Atmosphere/She's Lost Control, none of which appeared on the albums and are rightly regarded as among their greatest works.Substance also contains their first release in full, the EP An Ideal For Living (recorded in December 1977 at the point when they changed their name from Warsaw, but only released privately by the band in a limited edition the following summer), two tracks they recorded for the EP A Factory Sample (their first work with producer Martin Hannett), both sides of a freebie flexi-disc single (Komakino/Incubation), a French B-side (Dead Souls) and two outtakes from the Unknown Pleasures sessions.This is not a complete round-up but in its more complete CD edition will probably satisfy most of the less obsessive Joy Division punters"
4,Great fit,Good product. It looks like I will havze to iron it because it came so tightly wrapped that there are bends everywhere. Order was size up (which is what I did).Fits perfect.
4,Cool For a Young Pirate,I bought this for my little brother pirate..who wanted to be cool like his big brother with the ipod! It has worked great. It is not fancy...but it does hold enough music and is easy for a six year old to operate.
4,Disney Mix Stick MP3 Player,Great for small boys. Too bad it does not count with much disk space. Otherwise is a great gift.
1,Ridiculous!,"1st Of all when this bracelet arrived the case was jammed shut as if someone stepped on the box before sending it out for delivery. I literally hurt myself trying to pry it open. a couple of tools later I was taken back by the cheesy bronzy gold look. The bracelet looked extremely cheap. After I got over that I decided to try it on. Errrrr! Not so fast the clasp would not open. Thankfully I had tools so I finally got it on. I was gonna try to work with it. Then time came to take it off. I had to enlist my husband and he struggled to pry the clasp open for me. Enough was enough, I had to send it back."
5,Sabona bracelet,"I had to return this item because it was way too small for my husband. I think that it was a woman's medium, not a man's. It also seemed too delicate for a man. I either misread the describtion, or something.Louise Shoksnyder"
3,50/50,"Serves the purpose but difficult to control temperature. I would suggest using some form of rheostat in order to control voltage when lower temperatures are desired for jerky, fish, etc. Yes I know vents can be used but for one, that is a waste of electricity and two, you don't open your oven door if the temp is too hot you simply set it to the appropriate temperature."
2,"It works, nothing more","Why bother stating that it ships in a plain box if you aren't going to bother? Product was shipped in the box shown, complete with apicture and full description. Great way to spoil a surprise gift."
2,Just not enough heat,I love my Brinkman Smoke but the Electric Element didn t meet my expectations. It really doesnt generate enough heat to maintain the proper level for smoking.
3,Uncertain of Performance,"I purchased this unit after reading reviews, some positive and others negative. Testing it on a +50 degree day, the Brinkman smoker's thermometer never climbed into the ""ideal"" range, but only hovered near the top of the ""warm"" range. My test lasted some three to four hours, without food or wood chips inside, and I was somewhat disappointed. Once the weather warms up again, I'll try to test using a graduated thermometer to see the actual temperature it reaches. Hope this review can be updated."
4,One of Agnon's greatest novels,"This is one of the most famous Agnon's novels and one that is typical of his style, which has many layers of hidden meaning. My 4-star rating is only because, I believe, much of the hidden meaning will be missed by the reader who is unfamiliar with the basics of Judaism. The translation is very good, but those who know Hebrew can see how it is much funnier in the original."
4,Helpful,This book is particularly helpful with regard to explaining technology terms. It has been a useful tool for me.
5,Right on!,"This book was exciting! I really resonated with everything the author had to say. He's right on in explaining the flaws in our schools, and some ways to overcome them. A must read for every teacher, administrator and parent!"
4,Great for saving those cuticles while working.,"I bought these because my hands were getting torn up while scanning and opening our morning deliveries. They were very stiff the first time I used them but broke in with in two days. Very affordable price compared to some other places. They protect the hands/ nail beds well. You might even be able to use them for the weed or thorn pulling while gardening, but I got them for package handling and some grip to hold the scanner. The grip works great and most importantly my manicure is safe."
3,Wish I'd bought the SD Card,"Pros:The maps provide good contours, even in the boundary waters and small lakes that you wouldn't expect. Excellent 1 foot contours are available on popular lakes.Cons:I really didn't realize that I'd only be able to use this with just one unit. So, don't install this on your old GPS, because you're not able to transfer the maps to another unit. I think the sd card version solves this problem since you can just migrate it to other units."
2,RETRO GRADE,"Yes, this does seem to be a tribute to the 80's, but unfortunately, we have all been busy trying to FORGET the 80's!Had this release taken the genre a step in ANY direction, it might have succeded, but I'm going to have to agree that there are many better ways to spend your money. Roger Manning's solo (which version do you like?) is certainly more like what I'd hoped to hear here.The MAGIC, the WHIMSY, and the COMPLEXITY of the old Jellyfish recordings certainly is not apparent here. Todd Rundgren fans have had to suffer the same fate. It's as if they don't want to be creative magicians anymore, screw the fans that got them this far, etc. etc.ANYTHING released with the JELLYFISH name on it, domestic, european, or Sub-Tabla are better than this.OK, this is better than the MOOG COOKBOOK...."
5,this is a genius' thought,"jesus son of man is wonderful and this book-for me-worth dying for. i think gibran were understanding the bible perfectly(maybe, almost)before he wrote this amazing book. and his way seeing jesus is amazing too. see the chapter about a widow whose son following jesus ! this book absolutely amazing. five stars ain't enough to describe this book....."
4,Fact and Fantasy,"Kahlil Gibran's ""Jesus the Son of Man"" is a magical book filled with facts about Jesus' life interwoven with complete fantasy. It would be best to only read this book if you have already read the New Testament. In this way you will know what Jesus actually said and what Kahlil Gibran made up in a poetic fashion. I did enjoy this book as it made Jesus even seem more beautiful to me. Kahlil Gibran really does capture the essence of Jesus' teachings. He also really had a gift for telling the reader what they wanted to hear. Most of the accounts in this book are positive but a few are negative. Some of the people discussed really lived and interacted with Jesus and others seem born of fantasy. Some of the details are a little incorrect like Jesus was actually born in Bethlehem not Nazareth. I think you will enjoy this book because it is very poetic and it leaves you comforted and in a state of peace and joy.~The Rebecca Review"
4,silky soul indeed,"Maze featuring Frankie Beverly is unique soulful jazzy music that is not going to win over many Brittany Spears fans but should please anyone who likes well arranged funky 80's soul.Their somewhat Miles Davis like horn player really sounds superb on this release.The song ""Mandela"" is my favourite track being a harmonious call to release the then imprisoned South African leader with Beverlys' voice sounding passionate and emotive next to a beautiful chorus of backup singers.Joy and Pain is for me their finest hour, however this C.D.contains some fine moments also in spite of other reviews disparaging their mid 80's output."
4,Nellie's Tittle Review,This book called chancelloresville battlefield will help me and show me how to do my civil war project . The grade will help me get a good grade in American History.
3,This Book Was Great; Trilogy Was Weak,"I love the NJO series. But this trilogy was really one of the weakest parts of the entire series. In it's defense, Reunion would actually rate much higher with me if it wasn't for the first two Force Heretic books. I was extremely satisfied with this book especially after a disappointing beginning to the trilogy.The interactions between Luke and Jacen with Sekot are the highlight of the book along with Tahiri's merging of her two personalities. And Nom Anor is great as always. Plus, the retun of Droma teaming up with Han again was good to see. It just took too long to get to the good stuff of the 3rd novel. This should have been done as one novel with all the filler crap made more brief.This is a great series so you have to read all three books. It could have been better, though."
3,just another book,this book is ok just like so many of the others in this series. some action for the solos a quest for luke and mara. the parts with nom anor are definatley the best parts of the book. the problem with the njo series is its hard to really care about most of the characters because you dont really know them all that well. I mean i dont really care about the children of han and leia. dont get me wrong the books are entertaining enough and i have read quite a few of them and will continue to do so but really most of these are disposable literature.
2,Save your time and money!!!,"(...) the book was free of anoying things like action, humor, and the making of sense. O wait, I guess that's the same hand...I HIGHLY RECCOMEND YOU READ A SUMMARY somewhere or just have a friend you don't like very much read this book and give you the important details. But, if you're like me you'll probably go out and read it anyway because it's part of the series and you made it through balance point and dark journey so you can make it through this and at least you heard the next 2 books are good and the last one is almost as good as star by star which is the only reason you're still reading the series of course rebel dream and that other one by the same guy were pretty good but you're the only one who thinks so probably because you're the only one who read the entire X-wing series by the same author and liked that but yeah..."
3,Weak links in the NJO chain,"This is a general comment on all three Force Heretic books. These are some of the weakest books of the series, and found them just barely enjoyable and then only because I enjoy the Star Wars milieu so much. The basic problem is that they make very little sense. After reading the whole series I still have no idea who the ""force heretic"" the title refers to is. And I have only the foggiest idea why the characters think the quest for Zonama Sekot is important. While we're on the subject, the characters are poorly drawn and their actions make little sense. The whole thing is so weak that the books just aren't a lot of fun. Nevertheless, Reunion is the best of the three."
2,The NJO has reached an all-time low,"Well, after finally finishing the Force Heretic trilogy, I must say that I was sorely disappointed. It seems like the entire trilogy was just put there to bide time until the Final Prophecy comes out, which, after reading the Heretic trilogy, I'm not holding my breath to be any good. The NJO has had it's ups and downs, but these three books mark a definite all-time low. The first 9 books, as far as I'm concerned, were the NJO glory days, with a few books afterward being up to par, such Traitor and Destiny's Way. All of those books were an enjoyment to read, and I always looked forward to picking the book up and reading about an exciting space battle or a harrowing Jedi/Yuuzhan Vong duel. But I had to force myself to read all three of the books in the trilogy, because it wasn't something I looked forward to. I must say, after reading the Force Heretic trilogy, I'm on the verge of becoming NJO heretic."
2,Thank the force it's over!!,"Why on earth is this book getting such high star-ratings?The fact that these authors have done their research (and know the Star Wars Universe extremely well) can not possibly make up for the fact that they can't write!!The mistakes are many and unforgivable. The style is inconsistant. Characters completely change personality from page to page. The end result is simply unsatisfying.All three of these ""Force Heritic"" books could have been been made as one single book - or even left out entirely! Why make us suffer through this filler nonsense? It's not speaking well for the franchise.I only hope and pray that Dix and Williams aren't contracted to write the novelization for Episode 3."
4,Pickin One Back Up,"Coming back to this series and picking up where I left off made me worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy it as much as I used to but those fears were quickly put to rest. Even after losing track of this series, I still remembered the characters and what role they played in the series which goes to show how strong of an impact it made two years ago. While this volume isn't the greatest example of what this series can be, the final two volumes have me excited to keep going and finally see what happens to Daisuke and Dark Mousy."
3,Better ..,".. than the woods out back. More thought went into the plot. Less unbelievable fight scenes, and I think I am starting to understand RAS's audience.I guess that I do not fit the profile that he is writing for, because after reading one and a half novels in the series, it was clearly explained that the spear is talking to Gary telepathically. So why does the author feel the need to explain that other characters cannot hear what the spear is saying?Waste of space as far as I was concerned, but maybe if you are 12 yeas old you need the concept of telepathy explained more than once. Or maybe if you are senile you have forgotten.Still an improvement .. thankyou for not transporting the girlfriend."
4,Pure Fun,"I would like to start by saying that Salvatore is a genius. With this trilogy, he not only keeps your interest, but gives you a genuine feeling of really being in the Land of Faerie. He brings in someone from our time and place, puts them in faerie, and then the true magic begins. The Dragon's Dagger is a wonderful story of honor, excitement, and brilliant battle scenes along with some good wit and humor. It's funny, yet it keeps you holding your breath. Definately a can't-put-it-down book."
5,Robin Gibb is the greatest,"I love Robin Gibb and everything he does. You can buy any one of his CDs and never be disappointed! Please keep the solo albums coming, Robin!"
1,This is absolutely AWFUL!,"He may have started the joke, but nobody should be laughing.It's just too weird....please note that on ebay these CDs don't bring 30 cents. It's that bad. This guy could have matched vocal wits with Roy Orbison, but doesn't seem to care. When I think of all of the cover songs that he could have redefined...please write to Robin and let him know. And, my dear Robin, I still love you, but PLEASE do your audience the favor of once again changing direction!"
4,"Thank you, Robin","Robin's vibrato is nothing short of magical. Even though I don't like every track on this CD, I found it well worth the money. The remake of ""Wish You Were Here"" is especially haunting, especially when you realize that Maurice died not long after this CD was created. ""Love Hurts,"" originally done by Nazareth in the 1970's, seems totally new and original when sung by Robin. If you are a true Bee Gees fan (and especially a Robin fan), you will want to add this CD to your collection."
1,(BWB),"Oh boy this is hard to defend. I'm 25 years old and for the most part when I get made fun of for likeing the BGs I can kinda say ""whatever"". But dang this is a steaming pile. I never really liked RG's voice anyway so I really shouldnt have bought it to begin with. So yea if you like the Bee Gees this doesn't really reflect what they were about very much"
3,Quite A Departure For Robin Gibb,"Robin had done a great service by recognizing other great songwritings with this collection. However, as 'good' as this album is, it should have been fantastic. ""Please"" excels and is the appropriate single choice, but the other songs seem terribly bland and ill-fitting the voice of veteran Robin Gibb. There are no high-end fast paced songs and only one true power ballad. Granted, the production is well orchestrated, if not overproduced technology, but the songs just seem to drag. There just was no reason to re-record, ""Wish You Were Here"" or ""Lonely Night In New York"" - they are remarkable already. But then again, ""Don't Wanna Wait Forever"" shows promises with a great beatmix and ""Inseparable"" is a close second. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if ""Inseparable"" was the next single. Robin's intentions are good and I will play this album. It's just that I expected way too much."
4,You're a Robin fan or you aren't,"Also owning his solo albums from the 80s this one fits right in line. What ever the sound was at the time Robin was right in the middle of it. What this album does miss is his twin brother Maurice who would have been right in the middle of it, origonal songs or not. Outside of a new version of Another Lonely Night in New York this is a cover album.The songs are love songs but they're dealing with grief. Taken in the context of losing his twin, Magnet and the concert video could be seen as being cathartic for Robin. Going on with the show and re-recording a song the twins wrote together, Another Lonely Night in New York which might have been chosen with purpose, may be the best way to honor Maurice."
2,High expectations not met,"I was a little dissapointed with the CD. I thought Robin sounded very good, but he seemed like a fish out of water with the hip-hop feel of the music. ""Please"" and ""Wish You Were Here"" are the only two tracks that had any staying power for me-- ""Please"" had an especially nice sound to it, but even that song had too many background vocals for my taste, which was how the whole album felt to me. I think Robin's voice is strong enough to stand alone most of the time-- he doesn't need someone echoing his lyrics.Great voice, but it seemed out of place on this album."
2,Not the best....want to know why??,"I actually bought this CD a few years back when it was first released. I looked at the credits before actually popping the CD into the the player and noticed that with the exception of the BG remakes, they were mostly written by other people! I'm not sure why he let other people write the songs since he's completely capable to write his own songs. So what gives?I do not reconize any of the song writers credited on the CD and gee...I wonder why?? The song writing is terrible and the production is even worse. Most of the time Robin's vocals are drowned out by medicore backing vocals. Poor song writing doesn't help here.Did I mention the songs were terrible??The remake of Another Night in NY is a droned out, boring remake and the original wasn't my favorite either.Please is a great song to fall asleep to when you're having a bad case of insomneia.Advice? Robin, re-release your older solo efforts! This shows your real talents, not this CD!"
4,Excellent,"When I got this book it was exactly what I ordered, the right edition, and arrived earlier than expected! A fast transaction. This book is great for my class, goes over everything for my communication class."
3,Incorrect ingedients,"The description of the product was thus: Ingredients per Daily Serving of THREE (3) Glucosamine Chondroitin Joint Health Complex capsules: Glucosamine Sulfate 1,500 mg - Chondroitin Sulfate 1,200 mg - Essential Fatty Acids 30 IU - Vitamin C 75However the bottle's label says it contains only 500mg glucosamine sulfate, and 400mg chondroitin. I will contact the seller to see what's up."
2,I must have missed something.,I didn't get what was supposed to be scary or interesting about this. Someone else might get more out of it. The sound quality was horrible.
1,don't waste your money,"Unless you have nothing better to do then to sit around and wait for something to happen, don't rent this."
3,Revirw,"Wasn't as interesting as I had hoped it would be.I really enjoy paranormal stories, but this one left mevery disappointed. I would not recommend"
4,"Programming made ""easy""","This book was recommended by a professor of mine in my Master's program and I found it very helpful. The way the authors tie in both C++ and JAVA into the text is great for those that learning in a ""real world"" environment. The examples are easy to follow and understand what is going on. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a handle on C and then move into the other languages."
3,For Rank Beginners Only,"Most programmers come to C only after programming in other languages. If you fall into this category, this book is definitely not for you. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Deitel and Deitel, they publish books on a wide variety of programming languages and their treatment, right down to the examples and exercises, is identical in all. All their books are written to teach program design as well as the language in question. This is a waste of time for anyone who already knows how to program in at least one language. Buy this book only if you are absolutely new to programming in general and, for some reason, have chosen to learn C as your first language. Otherwise, you are much better off with Kernighan and Ritchie, Harbison and Steele, or Kenneth Reek's excellent book ""Pointers on C."""
3,Not bad but not for serious engineers,"I've only been using the C portion of this book (it also covers some C++ and Java), so my comments only refer to that portion. I got this book for an extension class at UCLA, and for the most part it explains things fairly well. As other reviewers have mentioned, it provides lots of longer examples. It seems to be geared towards beginners, so it tries hard to be easy to understand.It does have some issues, however. The examples are so simple that they sometimes don't explain more complex issues. The file and string I/O information is seriously lacking. For example, there's no discussion of the problems with using gets for string input or fscanf for file input.In my opinion, this book works for learning the basics, but it's not all that helpful as a reference once you want to start writing real programs and need to get into the nitty-gritty."
3,Wait.... how did that get there?,"I bought this book for a C course I am taking, and not being new to programming, I assumed that it would be a piece of cake with the much-raved-about book (this one). However, I was surprised, when going through the lessons, when they introduced commands in the sample programs without even mentioning them in the text. I had to start up my compiler and experiment with the commands to understand those.... Overall, this book is ok, but not my first reccomendation."
3,not as good as the old edition,The book should be about C programming language. C++ and Javaneed not be in the book.
2,There are better..,"The book is too detailed for no reason in the first chapters to simple concepts (sometimes you think it is for idiots.), but unfortunately very plain that there should be the exact opposite. For example, in pointers the analysis is very poor compared with the analysis presented in simpler terms.Not so good... There are more better..."
4,Chalked full of great information,"This book was required for a C programming class. It chalked full of great information. I learned a lot from this book and the instructor.4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the way the book is organized. Better organization could have been implimented. There are too many ""Good Programming Practicees"" and ""Common Programming Error"" boxes to clutter up the pages. Perhaps some Chicago style referencing and a section at the end of the chapter would help clean up the regular text. --- Also some of the subjects used for the codeing examples, and some of the coding examples themselves should be simpler. In other words the code examples tended to be difficult to follow at times.Overall the book is keeper. (That and because it has just been succeded by a a new edition and is no longer resellable for nearly what I paid for it. (This is the third edition.))This book is very usable even as an older edition."
4,Hilarious and very cleverly written film,"I downloaded this film on a recommendation from a friend, and thought it was hilarious. The characters are spot on and the story so relevant to today's society, where fame seems to be everyone's goal. However the plot and characters are also done very cleverly, a laugh out loud satire I have recommended to friends now."
5,Enjoyable Series!,My daughter and husband have read the entire series together as a before bed reading time. They take turns reading aloud to each other. They have enjoyed each and every book in the series!
4,Buy 'em all,"Lemony Snicket books are great. My kid read all of them. But do yourself a favor. If you're going to buy a set, buy the big complete set, and you'll end up saving about $40"
4,Good Quality Books,This was a gift for my daughter who now has the entire series. She loves them and they are a good quality hard bound books.
4,A GOOD HIT CD.,"Some hits , Some not but all great . This is a good body of work. George is and always be one of the best rock guitar players and song writer around. A nice cd to have."
3,Best of Dark Horse by George Harrison,"Best of Dark Horse by George HarrisonI bought this when I had listened to a couple of hes songs on the radio and decided to get some to have on my computer library to listen to while working. Glad I did, even if I don't bring it on as regularly, as I do my absolute favorite music. Good Album. I still call them Albums, even CD's."
1,Half-Hearted,"Best of Dark Horse is another half-hearted attempt to gather George Harrison's greatest songs together. This time we only get tracks from 1976 to 1989.While there are some good songs (Blow Away, Crackerbox Palace, Cheer Down, etc.) the rest don't represent his best songs from this period. Where's Faster, This Is Love, Someplace Else, etc?The only reasons to purchase this CD are for the rarities Poor Little Girl, Cockamamie Business and Cheer Down.Until they make a true Best Of, we'll have to make our own single-disc compilation. Here are the tracks needed: Apple Scruffs, My Sweet Lord, All Things Must Pass, What Is Life, Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth), Living In The Material World, Crackerbox Palace, Blow Away, All Those Years Ago, Dream Away, Cloud 9, This Is Love, Someplace Else, Got My Mind Set On You, End Of The Line, Handle With Care, Cheer Down, Devil's Been Busy, Any Road, Rising Sun.[DW]"
4,A solid collection!,"This is a solid collection of Harrison's work from 1976 to 1989 and is a nice compliment to ""The Best Of George Harrison"" (which covers his pre-1976 work). There is one major omission from this CD, ""This Song"" from the 33 1/3 album which was top 40 hit in 1976. Other than that, this CD contains all the highlights from the period.However, Harrison's work deserves a new, comprehensive collection spanning his entire solo career with all his hits and important songs in a single collection! His work merits it and his fans deserve it!"
5,Get unserious,"N. Dorward's review does not really require this correction, does it? Surely nobody who has ever heard Carla Bley's music needs to be told that there are no circumstances under which she could ever flag-wave for an immoral war without irony--right? This CD's title alone makes that clear. Like her Liberation Music Orchestra co-founder Charlie Haden, Ms. Bley loves America far too much, too deeply, and too intelligently to ever become one of its knee jerks. Indeed, LOOKING FOR AMERICA is one of her clearest, and best, statements to that effect. On the day she becomes a flag-waver, Hell will be considerably colder than a Toronto winter.This is one of the very best CDs yet from a talent the size of Duke Ellington or Frank Zappa."
4,A great reference,"This is a great book to read with your Bible to give you extra study notes & insights into the book you are studying. If you are hoping to read it by itself, you will be disappointed. This handbook gives you historical backgrounds, key words, key chapters, key verses, outlines, timelines & more, all in a book that could fit in your back pocket. A great, handy reference for any one who studies the Bible."
1,Rosetta Stone German Level 1,This product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs. The tech support emailed that any CD or DVD copy software had to be removed. I guess that sort of makes a DVD or CD R/W drive rather pointless. I removed the copy software and still have bad results. About 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it. Maybe it doesn't like my corporate virus protection. I find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky. I rate this product as totally useless.
4,Good program,"I started using this program so that I can learn German. I live in a Dutch speaking home and Dutch was my first language. Since the two languages are very similar I decided to begin learning German. The program is very good, although translations would be helpful, and if the grammar was explained. Also it would be nice if they introduced the definite articles with each noun introduced in the vocabulary, this would make it much easier instead of having to eventually figure out the noun gender. But all in all this program is quite good to learn basic German, move on to the second version of this program to learn more advanced things."
2,Not worth it,"Supposively this was suposed to be the best language learning product out on the market. Yes it wasn't that hard to learn the words, but after finishing it I only knew how to stay stuff like the man eats or dances, or the flowers are blue. Nothing really practical. It's not like I'm going to go up to someone and German and say, ""Der Mann isst"" (the man eats) After this program I din't even know how to say I like... or I would like...to eat. Plus Rosetta Stone doesn't have any translations at all, and even though i believe vocab is much more important then grammar, it doesn't even teach you any fundemental grammar.Basically you can buy a language book for $20 that will teach you a lot more german than this.Ja, ihr kauft nicht Rosetta Stone. (I didn't learn that from Rosetta Stone)"
5,"How To, Why To","This is a viable resource for networking and marketing oneself as an independent consultant and provides many suggestions as to how to effectively make the transition from full-time employment to independent consulting. Seasoned consultants may benefit as well from the re-affirmation of the non-traditional ""career path"" independent consulting constitutes."
1,I had high hopes for this after seeing it demonstrated on HSN,"However, the cats refuse to walk on it, so they leap and fly out of the box, scattering litter everywhere. It actually made the problem worse!"
1,Don't buy this - Save $50 and get the Airhogs Havoc. It's EXACTLY the same,"So, I put both this and the Airhogs Havoc on my wishlist for a recent birthday and actually received both of them. I was looking forward to seeing what the difference was that would warrant a $50 difference in price.Well they're both here and they are the same toy from the same manufacturer. They are in the same packaging with the same remote and the same stickers.I don't intend this to be a negative review of the product, as I'm 34 years old and haven't had this much fun with a toy since I was 12. It flies great and is completely addictive.Having said that, it's exactly the same as the Havoc. I even took my Havoc's controller, switched it to the appropriate channel, and it controlled the Picco Z perfectly.I absolutely recommend the helicopter..... just save the $50 and get the Havoc.Good luck!"
3,Had I never seen the show...,"If you're a huge fan of the TV show, as I am, then the book will be somewhat disappointing. I found it very dry and not nearly as funny as I was expecting. Perhaps if I hadn't ever seen the TV show I would feel differently. If, on the other hand, you are more a fan of the M*A*S*H movie then you might be pleasantly surprised."
4,MASH is a novel revolving around the lives of a MASH crew.,"If you were a fan of the television series M*A*S*H, then you would love this book. This book takes you to the beginning. It introduces the characters that we all know and love, and through third person perspective, the author depics the crazy antics of the characters. Revolving around Duke and Hawkeye, the book takes you through the routine of the crew of the Mobil Army Surgical Hospital , better known as the MASH 4077th. In my opinion, this book is a winner. Through the author's skills, you will become attached to the characters, and in the end, you will have a bittersweet feeling of the characters' departures in the end. The author spices the book up generously with the humor that is unique to the television series."
4,A different M.A.S.H.,"The novel is strikingly different in many ways from the film and the TV series which followed it. Some of the charcters are entirely different from the way they were portrayed in the move and Tv series. For instance, Colonel Blake and Father mulchahey are both much tougher characters than they are portrayed as being in the later vehicles. Major Houlihan doesn't play nearly such an important role in the book as she does in the film or series. Trapper and Hawkeye are like and yet not like their later versions. The book is very funny however and is well worth reading, and it is very interesting to compare it with the later and quite different versions. I don't know how Richard Hooker felt about the changes made to his characters in the later versions, but certainly this, the original book that started it all, should be read by any fan of the other versions."
2,No 'Catch-22',"First book I've read where the movie was better than the original book. Don't get me wrong, there were some extremely funny scenes. However, Hooker just isn't that good of a writer. It shows, as the book gets better as it goes along.Hooker employs that basics of black comedies about war: ironic repitition of monikers, and presentation of absurdities with a stark descriptive style that highlights the absurd. That's all very nice, but there is no real common plot thread throughout the book. Characters appear and then disappear for sixty pages, so the gags at their expense aren't as funny; since we lose a sense of how uptight they are.Buy the movie with Donald Sutherland, and read Joseph Heller if you want a great black comedy about war."
4,Good and Funny,"Very humorous, exciting book. It really was enjoyable. When I first read the book, I had no idea who was who and what was what. But eventually all the pieces came together."
2,Catch 4077,"Not a great book. Not a bad book. It seems to be trying to be as clever as ""Catch 22"" (the comparison is inevitable), but doesn't quite get there.I recommend it for fans of the movie and TV series because it's interesting to see the source material, but both the movie and TV series improved on the book."
1,This item has poor quality and is a disappointment!,I would have wanted to know that this teakettle was hard to keep clean and looked cheap. I bought two of these and am very disappointed with the lack of quality.
1,CRAP,"This item is aesthetically appealing but is very cheaply made and does not stay together once assembled. The connector piece that joins the upper metal rods is made of plastic and does not hold the speaker in place. The rubber that is supposed to keep the upper rod in place doesn't. I do not recommend these stands. Unfortunate, as they would be very nice to look at...the bases are beautiful and made of glass."
2,be aware!,"I was not totally satisfied with this product. I have assembled 100's it items at home before but still the assembly of this one was quite confusing. The major source of disappointment was the way the stand looks once assemebled. Once completely assmembled, the glass base of the stand doesn't sit parallel to the floor, rather it slopes towards the front, making the entire stand look quite awkward. None of the pictures on the box or in the assemebly instructions clearly show this. So I had to struggle with it for while, trying to figure out what I was doing ""wrong"". (why it won't sit flat with the floor). Finally called the customer support only to be told that the ""slopped base"" was by design. So be aware of this"
1,Yawn ...,"Read the reviews and thought I would check this out. Big mistake. Reads like a sophmore's creative writing sample at best. Redundant, slow pacing. And at times ham-handed.Don't bother.Might make a good door stop if it was a little thicker.Save your money."
5,Terrific suspense,"What a great read! L.Marie Wood picks you up by the scruff of your neck, swings you around a few dozen times and sets you back down not knowing which way is up and then you see where the poor sap is headed. I am very impressed and can't wait for her next work!"
1,Wasted effort,"Perhaps the author's intentions were in the right place but the final product is a confusing, pretentious mess. Written in such a way as to alienate almost everyone. Even one star is generous!!"
2,"A little variety, please?","OK, I will concede the fact that Bam Bam by Pliers, Dem a Bleach by Nardo and Murder She Wrote are dancehall classics. but every song using the exact same beat? This is why I returned this CD when it came out and wouldn't buy it now.For the three songs mentioned above, they are all over the place on other dancehall compilation CDs. The rest, you won't miss them...as you already will have the beat! Dancehall in the 80s and 90s used to recycle beats all the time but this is ridiculous."
3,A History of Christianity,"The positives of this book are that at least it's readable and the author does a pretty good job of keeping is bias at bay until you hit the Crusades. Aside from that the book is sorely lacking. What is interesting is that Treadgold was a professor of Russian History and yet his treatment of Christian history is mostly western centric. This may be an interesting book for an Orthodox Christian who would like to better understand how the Western Church ended up in the state it is today, but aside from that this book has only marginal value."
1,I dont recommend this product,"After you use Sui Dreams by Anna Sui you cant even tell... the smell fades away in minutes. I have used the whole bottle in less than two weeks, it is like spraying water on yourself. The bottle I bought from the store few years back lasted for a very long time to the last drop. Do not buy this product.Sui Dreams by Anna Sui for Women - 1 oz EDT Spray"
5,Happy with Purchase,"I was overall very satisfied with the purchase. no hassle, no problems and arrived very quickly. Would certainly do business with again.Thanks,Pauline"
5,A great way to complete your Little House collection,It was everything I was expecting and more! The interviews and special features were done really well and the movies were great!!
5,Little House Fan,"Fabulous. My sons, 21 and 14, enjoyed the series tremendously and now my youngest son, 15 months, can too! These episodes are essential to complete the series. Too bad the series hasn't revived as the ""Next Generation"" even without Michael Landon and Victor French."
5,Going out in style-The Last Farewell!!!,"I am a Little House fan--both books and tv shows. I bought this collector's edition just in case they ran out because I wanted The Last Farewell episode. After I watched all three episodes again, I was glad that I spent the money for it. All three were very touching. (I get very emotional when Little House episodes are on.) The manger scene in Bless All the Dear Children and the issue of Albert dying in Look back to Yesterday was emotionally charged (for me, anyway). Imagine sitting with a box of Kleenex (or a roll of TP) while watching these shows."
2,Only for the Diehard Fans,"I liked the series, but I thought it was a last ditch desperate attempt to put these out. I just felt like they were made for almost no reason. Sorry but I would not buy this again if I had the choice."
1,A complete rip-off!,"This set was a complete rip-off. I felt absolutely cheated because I paid $26.99 for three episodes that they really could have saved me money on and put them in with Season 9. Or they could have at least not made this set cost almost as much as a season's worth of DVDs. I also wasn't particularly impressed with the episodes, especially ""Bless All the Dear Children."" It was like the producers ran out of ideas and put anything together just to have a show for viewers to watch. And the ""Look Back to Yesterday"" about Albert dying, I thought in the episode where he was using morphine, at the end of that episode Laura says that Albert returns to Walnut Grove as a doctor. But then with this episode he dies before ever becoming a doctor. I could be wrong about that, but it doesn't change my mind about being disappointed with this set. I would have rather had these episodes at a much cheaper price."
2,"Great show, the end of the story","This is a beautiful product, also if the third movie print used for this DVD is not the best one could dream of... It's very sad that I received a damaged package with 2 DVDs almost full with scrathches. The product is very good, but in my case it went all very badly..."
5,Little House on the Prairie - Special Edition Movie Boxed Set (Look Back to Yesterday / Bless All the Dear Children / The Last F,"All 9 Seasons and all Episodes of Little House on the Prairie provided wholesome entertainment for the whole family... God is mentioned in nearly every episode and people are encouraged to have love, compassion and understanding of each other. You just can't find entertainment like this on DVD or TV anymore.. :-) If there were more than 5 stars to rate Little House on, I'd make it the BEST!!"
2,Not what I expected,"Just episodes, and sad ones at that -- expected more of a historical look at the show in total."
5,Independent Gay Gem,"I am a big indie film buff. No big on making comments on movies I rent, but I thought I would give this one a shot! This is one that I felt was worth the money, although being skeptical at first. I am so pleased that I purchased this. It has its funny points, it campy points, and serious points. Well worth watching!"
4,heavy metal noise,this is what i believe to be the album that kicked off the industtial revolution. a must have for metal and industrial
3,Ministry: The land of rape and honey,Ministry CD The land of rape and honey is a great CD Recommended Buy. But this CD in itself is a remaster and may not play in windows media player.Mine did NOT. Everything arrived faster then expected and was in great shape.. I ordered on a thursday and got it on the following Monday. Other then that i would buy from this seller again. Will Buy mp3's from now on me thinks. ;O)~~~~
5,Fantastic! 1988!!!!,"Being a late bloomer to Ministry, I discovered this recording after I had gotten into Psalm 69,, ect. Once I heard this record, which STILL sounds original and fresh today, I was astounded to read that it had been originally released in 1988. Ministry was light-years ahead of there time! I like Twitch, which I was told is their cross over LP, but the shear genius of The Land of Rape and Honey still astounds me today! Every song on this record stands on its own and for me, it is the bands finest work to date. It is not the most commercial thing they did as it is probably the most progressive of any of their material. Excellent spin if you can find it!"
3,regular,"Compré este libro usado, porque lo necesitaba parta una clase de 3 semanas- la cual no merecía gastar el precio del libro nuevo.Sinceramente, el libro no estaba en buenas condiciones. La portada (cover) estaba enmascarada (masking tape all over it- yes, masking; not even the transparent one) y Las páginas tan escritas y rayadas qué a veces se me hacía imposible leer lo que decía.Le estoy dando 3 estrellas sólo porque me lo entregaron más o menos en el tiempo especificado y porque después de todo adivinaba lo que decía cada palabra fuertemente marcada..."
5,Very Talented!,Loved their style and wished they had a DVD version of this one.Can't get enough of it. Must listen to it yourself to appreciate the talent.
3,It's OK...Depending on How you Learn Best...,"I found that I can not learn another language without ANY English involved. I don't like having to guess at what they would like for me to know just by looking at pictures. I need to hear it in English first and then hear the foriegn phrase.I also think that if you use this software, you will definitely need a dictionary in order to research what they are saying."
2,only ok,"All in all this program isn't bad but it doesn't seem to have anything on grammar. Without learning the grammar of a language it is almost pointless to learn it because you will sound like a fool to someone who knows the language. The only other program I have tried is French NOW by Transparent Language which is just as good as this program, has grammar turtorials, and is much more affordable."
3,Content Disappointing,The teaching method seems fine but I'll have to buy Level 2to be able to order a sandwich in a bistro! Can't believe they thoughtzoo animal names should be tought before food names. Major bumoutor buy both levels at once and go through 100 lessonsbefore you can order breakfast!I asked Rosetta Stone about this problem with Level 1French and they answered by referring me to their Englishteaching software to find food names. Not a help.
3,Rosetta Stone; Not best for everyone,"I'm aware that Rosetta Stone is highly regarded in pedagogic circles. However, I haven't had much success with the methods employed by both Rosetta Stone and ""Tell Me More."" Seeing pictures representing words spoken in French doesn't stick in my head. I prefer the much less expensive ""Learn to Speak French,"" which includes grammar tutorials and allows me to drill over and over while reading the French word and, if I like, the English translation. Admittedly, I am a novice student. Perhaps once I have the basics of the French language, grammar and all, under my belt, then I'll move on to Rosetta Stone with more success."
1,You may be able to get this for free.,"Before you pay a bundle for this product, check your local library. My library cooperative, in Hillsborough County, Florida, owns a licence for the whole shebang, every language and every level. Maybe yours does too: it won't hurt to check. I found it quite by accident in my library's online catalog. I registered by entering my library card number, loading a plugin that was provided, and creating a password. Now I can access it at home online and use any set of lessons I want, for the cost of a library card, which I had anyway. Actually I spent quite a lot of time on the French module, but when I got to Paris I had very little occasion to remark that the children were about to jump off the table. (I plan to cross post this to other language modules.)"
5,colin's best work,this albums continue's a string of incredible albums from one of the decade's best song writersbravo!
3,"Good, not great","I had listened to another The Decemberists album ""The King is Dead"" and loved it so I thought I would go ahead and give this a shot. I like it but not as much as ""The King is Dead"". The two albums are actually quite different but then I had read that they intentionally try to create a new sound with each album. I like this album but if you are chosing between the two I would say go with ""Tne King is Dead""."
5,I'm sure the Decemberists can do wrong but I haven't heard it yet.,"I love The Decemberists, I own 9 of their albums (though that's just a portion of their discography) and each one is magnificent.The Crane Wife is no different."
5,Quite Tasty,"I can't add more than just another 5 star review. The vocals don't seem so unique or possibly grating on this cd as on their earlier discs. Not that the singer's voice is bad - it just took a little getting used to on, for example, Picaresque.The songs are better than ever before, and the tasty prog rock touches were lovely! I was thoroughly impressed and salivating while listening to this disc. Picaresque and Castaways may be just as good - but this was quicker for me to take a liking to."
4,Slight Disappointment,"I really set myself up to be disappointed with The Crane Wife cause I bought the pre-release hype. After reading all the good words, I was expecting to be blown away. Then after a couple of listens I realized I had had tricked myself. The Decemberists aren't the kind of band that blows people away. The Decemberists are a band that charms you and soothes you with loving songcraft and theatrical whimsy. Crane Wife didn't inject directly into my blood stream like the infectious Picaresque (my first of the band's CDs). In fact, some two weeks later, Crane Wife is still slowly soaking in. I dont hear the adventuresome and free spirited Decemberists I've grown to love. In fact Collin even seems a little more uncertain in his singing on Crane Wife. Not the lyrics, just the execution. ""When the War Came"", ""Yankee Bayonet"" and ""Shankhill Butchers"" are standouts. 4 stars is being nice."
5,Best Decemberists Album Yet,"This is by far my favorite album by The Decemberists. Their unique musical style and flare shows itself in this album as it has never occured before. All the disapointment that I felt after Picaresque was eliminated by this album.Rather than tell a different story with each individual song the songs of this album are interlaced about a similair theme. This makes the album much more cohesive and aides in understanding of the songs to no end. Also, for all of you that feel that you can never sing along with The Decemberists be prepared to not only sing along but also hum these intoxicating songs every day for the next month."
4,Major (Label) Success,"While more polished (think produced) than previous offerings, The Crane Wife still delights with Colin Meloy's signature voice and storytelling."
3,Less Compelling Than You Might Think,"I've been a decemberist fan for quite some time, and own all of their previous releases. They certainly deserve the boost in popularity they've received with this album, however, I wish the popularity had been in response to a more powerful musical effort. The truth of the matter is that this is *not* their best work. That can be found scattered across stronger releases like ""Castaways and Cutouts"", where the lyrcism felt more like great story-telling than forced, marketable pretentiousness, and the musical arrangements were both more cohesive, and more in tune with the scenery dreamed up by the words.I reccomend this album to all who are well-acquainted with this band. However, I wouldn't start here to discover the brilliance of the Decemberists."
3,Good not great,"""When the War Came"" and ""The Island"" are kind of hard to make it through. The guitar bit on War is just so repetitive it drives me nuts. Maybe, like war, it is supposed to, but I don't put war in my CD player.There are some great songs, Crane Wife 3 particularly, but it's just not as fun to listen to as Castaways and Cutouts or Picaresque.It'll probably grow on me more once I've absorbed all the lyrics, but not When the War Came, ugh."
1,"Careful, those who like to enjoy themselves.","Ouch. I bought this album because of some promising reviews. I listened to it on head phones numerous times, really trying to feel it. To get it. But I just can't. It comes off as Jethro Tull hijacked by the most tedious English teacher of all time. I truly hate this record. I don't get how this qualifies as ""indie."" It is so derivative and lackluster--devoid of coolness."
4,One of my favorite stories...,"I couldn't resist this completely blind purchase because of the title. I did read the reviews and thought 4 out of 5 can't be thoroughly repulsive.I'd never heard any of their stuff and I'm always looking for new art/music.To make a long story short, I immediately liked the title track and thought the rest of the album was ""student center fluff"". My 5 year old daughter begged me to play it everytime we were in the car. She loves the story of the Crane Wife and the Shankhill Butchers.Since her plees have forced the exposure, the more I play it the more I like it. It may not be an album I would put on for company because the lyrics don't lend them selves to conversation, but then that's perfectly alright too."
3,"Good, not great","As usual, sometimes the things you first liked about a band aren't there the next time around. It took a few listenings but I finally got around to enjoying most of this CD. I really liked the Picturesque(sp?) one before however. This CD seems too prog rockish, yet at that same time too simple musically (especially the 10 minute+ 2nd song). The lyrics are pretty good, though (except the obligatory anti-war song)."
5,Cherish This Wonderful Album!,"This is a really good album from a band that continues to grow in stature. They really play well, with strong harmonies and catchy folk/rock tunes that have something to say. The opening song 'The Crane Wife 3' sets the tone beautifully and I was hooked from that moment on. The 4-part second track ('The Island - Come and See - The Landlord's Daughter - You'll Not Feel The Drowning') is just brilliant. You can dance to 'The Perfect Crime', rock to 'When the War Came', get mellow over 'Shankhill Butchers' and sing along to 'Sons & Daughters'. There is a wealth of story-telling here and some really good musicianship.There are some albums that you just play over and over again. They become favourites and are like old friends. This is one of those. 'The Crane Wife' deserves to be a success. The Decemberists are a fantastic, inventive band, and I highly recommend this album."
3,Eh...,"The cd seemed to be in alright condition, but the case was slightly broken and there was no plastic around it, which seemed shady for a supposedly ""new"" cd."
2,pretentious pretentiousness,"sorry but note the redundancy of the title above--there are much much much better hyperliterate kooks out there--and certainly far more melodic jangly pop bands working senses overtime these days. Quirky's an awful flavor of tar to brush a band with, but boy The Sugarplastic, Anton Barbeau, Sparklehorse, Yo La Tengo, Robyn Hitchcock, and The Black Watch ALL put out idiocincratic, MUCH more satisfying and beautiful records than this lot's done. the title track is all right. the lilting nature of a FEW of the melodies is pleasing, but boy does this record, for the most part, GRATE and CHAFE anyone who grew up on good quirk (XTC, Jazz Butcher, et alia). AVOID the decemberists' brand of ""off"" pop--i WANTED to like this. i really did. i played it around 7 times. It's boring and self-conscious. sad."
1,...AND SLAYER TREMBLES!!!,"This will be my shortest review ever. I know, everyone wins.This is one of two things.It's either...A) utterly twee garbage that should really be avoided...OR...B) a perfectly transcendant experiance (for Belle & Sebastian fans).Oh wait...those are the same thing.Well...whatever...nevermind."
1,Pap for Poseurs,"Colin Meloy, tone-deaf Irish pirate? They choose to sing fairytales because any other topic would reveal exactly how atrocious and one-dimensional they really are. The music sounds like a try-out for a junior-college frat party. And Meloy simply cannot sing and should never be allowed near another microphone. Somebody should also fine him $500 for polluting the ether with that ""per-fect currrrr-rye-um"" hokum.And the pseudo-intellectualism of the whole endeavor is just blatant. If you doubt this, try reading their fake scrambling to explain why they allegedly purposely decided to mis-spell ""Decembrists."" No way."
5,an amazing listen,"This meloncholic dreamy ballard journey carries you away. the lead singers voice is mezmerizing. The stories are strange and the world they describe violent and full of loss and longing but the music, in a minor key is soothing, complex and rich. I hear the songs all day in my mind. My children, jaded teens have stolen the cd from me. It got album of the year on NPR and I can see why."
5,Credit where credit's due.,"The Decemberists have managed to pull up their Indie roots and head towards the mainstream of rock with their newest album, The Crane Wife. Their switch to Capital only strengthened an already solid hold on progressive rock and, with luck, The Decemberists will inspire a greater lyrical standard for other musical artists. They are rock for English majors and everyone else who enjoys a story with their music.Witty, engaging, vivid, and even Epic, The Crane Wife helps The Decemberists arrive to the place most of their fans believed they were heading."
4,Diana Palmer - Winter Solider,This book has Diana's story called The Winter Solider.It's the story for Cy Parks.
3,a real puzzlement... hated it... but couldn't put it down,"Okay, I just don't get it. If any other readers can explain the title of this book to me, I'd appreciate it. Still, it kept my attention to look at this buccolic Ireland. The love story is... well, it's a love story. The question is, who loves whom???"
2,Dull,"What makes this book at all interesting is the way the author uses Missy, the genetically engineered lamb, who functions essentially as another character; despite that, the story is pretty conventional. The plot is straightforward, and Ms Haverty deals with themes we've all seen before. It's an easy read, but not particularly exciting or thought provoking; my biggest objection, though, is that as the story moved forward, I found it quite predictable."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I have to say I was very disappointed. I only liked about 7 or 8 crafts from the entire book. I thought they seemed too complicated and time consuming, especially for the younger kids. I'd recommend ""The Encyclopedia of Bible Crafts for Preschoolers"" also, ""The Encyclopedia of Bible Crafts for Kids"". Much easier and includes a mini lesson."
5,Great crafts for all ages,"This has been a wonderful book for me. I teach a class with children ranging from ages 3-12. I was able to modify the crafts easily for the little ones. This book has lots of great, easy to follow ideas. I would recommend it to anyone needing a great bible craft book."
1,Terribe Fit,"I bought 2 sizes, one was too small and the other too large. Obviously this company is not using real dogs for sizing. A real waste of money...too bad...sadly disappointed...I even contacted the manufacturer to go over the sizing...companies need to check with real people and real dogs before manufacuring products for them..."
5,Voice of an Angel,"I recently purchased this album, and think it is one of the best I have ever heard. K.D.'s voice is a mix of country, blues, and new age. I have never heard anything like it. It's like she pulls you into her music and you belong to her while she is singing. It's hynotic in a way. The music also compliments her amazing voice. You can't go wrong with this one."
5,Classy KD Lang,"This women has a God given voice that can sooth the average beast. Great Driving music, working music or watering your lawn/garden sound. Her talent is Golden. She sings her own songs and showcases her devine talent with such ease. I want some of that. KD lays out her heart and even touches things in all our souls. I can't imagine not having this in my collection. Keep going KD, the best is yet to come..."
5,My Mom loves her,"Although this is not my favorite type of music genre I bought this and several others for my Mom and she just loved it.....I laughed when my 83 yr old Mom when I mentioned I heard KD was gay said so what, I just want to listen to her."
4,"Since when is it ""guilty until proven innocent""?","I liked the CD. Quick shipping. I am no longer shopping at Amazon, nor am I using my Visa or Mastercard cards because of the way Amazon and the credit card companies immediately attacked Julian Assange and Wikileaks. Julian has not been brought up on any charges relating to the publishing of the State cables. And, Julian did not steal the cables, he only published them, after redacting names. How does that make him any different than the NYT, The Guardian or other newspapers which also published the cables. My Christmas shopping will not be done om Amazon and if your are a ""seller"", you lose too. I'll be interested to see if Amazon censors this ""review""."
3,K.D.Lang - The Midas Touch,"Shadowland is subtitled `The Owen Bradley Sessions' for good reason: Owen Bradley is one of the main people responsible for the evolution of the Nashville Sound. He minimized the use of fiddles and steel guitars while emphasizing strings and backing vocals. Bradley's production ideas gave artists such as Eddy Arnold, Kitty Wells, Marty Robbins, Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee and Loretta Lynn crossover appeal. Once considered `hillbillies,' artists became popular both in the Country and Pop Charts. K. D. Lang has always had the Midas touch: everything she touches (including Shadowland) turns to gold. Shadowlands is a country CD for people who don't like country music. K. D.'s voice is sultry, smoky and pleading. Favorites include `I Wish I Didn't Love You So,' `Shadowland' and `Tears Don't Care Who Cries Them.' Can anyone do loss-and-heartache better than K. D. Lang? Not for my money."
5,Traveling music,"I've owned this CD for a long time, The first time I heard it I wondered if Patsy Cline had been reincarnated. KD has been described as one of the 50 best voices of the 20th century, please add this one to your collection."
3,Purchased CD,Happy with product. Received item as described. Will purchase from seller in the future.
5,No need to read more....,"This was the only book I ever read on Crusades along the Baltic states and after reading this book, I realized that I really don't have to read too much more. This book proves to be very nicely written, well researched and clearly unbias in nature. The writing prose flows very nicely and I was pretty much engrossed by the subject, material and information the book provided. Since it covered a subject matter not well known in the United States, we can considered it as a blessing that there is such a book like this to enlightened us. For any military historians out there, this is a ""must have"" book for your library."
4,COMPANION TO TEUTONIC ORDER,"THE NORTHERN CRUSADE IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK TO UNDERSTAND THE LITTLE KNOWN CRUSADES IN GERMANY, POLAND AND LITHUANIA. THIS BOOK, AND THE BOOK TITLED, THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS, GIVES AN EXCELLENT OVERVIEW OF THIS CRUSADE IN NORTHERN EUROPE"
4,Great but the facts oh the facts,On meeting the author at oxford i took it upon myself to read this book. He is a very intelligent and interesting old geezer and this is reflected in his book but don't get bogged down with the endless facts and figures. He is a serious historian and most of his readers are not...chill and read it with a beer.
4,my thoughts,I think the book was biblically sound. It abolishes the new age believes of what heaven is like and gives a biblical definition of what heaven is like.
2,not impressed!,This book didn't deliver..... I was disappointed with the way the author delivered his information. I felt like instead of giving me ideas on what is in heaven he was too busy debunking everybody else and telling me why they were wrong. Having a hard time finishing it up...
3,MAD MIGUEL,"This movie is reminiscent of the cult classic RACE WITH THE DEVIL just bloodier. Respected actor Miguel Ferrer hams it up as a devilish biker out to bring Satan's spawn to rule the world. A group of do-gooders stumble on this cannibalistic group and end up battling them to grisly consequences, aided by a Bruce Willis wannabe. The film has some welcome humor and launches Katharine Isabelle as the next scream queen. It's all mindless fun and should please genre diehards."
1,Spend your money on other books,"I scored over 750 on the GMAT and don't feel that Barron's did very much for me. The tests in the book are of the old style so they do not represent the GMAT CAT well. The software format is completely different from the actual GMAT CAT and just doesn't feel right (after practicing with the actual ETS software). If you are looking for actual tests, look at Kaplan or the Unofficial Guide to the GMAT. In retrospect, I would only buy this book again if I had over a year to study for the test."
1,Go elsewhere for study material,"I earned a 680 on the real GMAT. On actual past GMATs that are published, I got a 690 and a 680. I only got a 560 on Barron's practice test! Many of their pratice questions were logically flawed. Buy the real past tests from ETS. You will get practice with the way the GMAT people actually think."
2,included software is terrible,"I have quite a few complaints about this book.1) The CD is an exact copy of the text of the book. I am not quite sure what the point of the book is now that I have the CD.2) The software doesnt give you a score on your practice tests! Even the free software that is available from GMAT.com will score your practice test! This software also will not score your essay, you are supposed to have a friend score it for you. (Again, the free software at GMAT.com will score it for you).3) When ""reading the book"" from the CD, the format is awful. For example, the math review section is 97 pages long. The controls are ""Forward"" and ""Back"". If you dont read it all in one sitting, you have to click ""Next"" until you get to where you stopped.My advice: Buy another book, and download the free software from GMAT.com."
2,CD-ROM not compatible with Windows 98,"I was extremely disappointed when I tried to load the CD-ROM and I continuously received ""illegal operation"" messages. I returned the CD to a local bookstore and they exchanged it for a new one. The new one did the same thing. So, if you have Windows 98 or higher on your PC you may want to buy the book without the CD."
1,Worst Book Ever!,"I have never used such a sorry excuse for a GMAT prep book. I'm not even done with diagnostic test and yet I cannot believe how many errors/misprints there are. Like the above readers, I too would like my money back. Your money is better spent elsewhere. Stay away from this book."
2,study material preparation for GMAT,"I am a Chemical Engineer of Bombay University handling about 800 students for test preparation of GRE/GMAT & SAT. I find your study material extremely useful but the explanations given for Maths as well as Analytical sections are very long. I have picked up about 13 problems from The Barron's Official guide for GMAT 9th edition to demonstrate how problems can be tackled in real quick time.I am very keen to get associated with your setup for preparation and improvement in study material, as by using the same study material the average score of my students for quantitative and analytical sections together has been exceeding 1540. I intend to visit USA some time in Feb/March 2002 to see my daughter who is studying in Chicago. Will it be possible for you to spare some time for me ?"
1,"Outdated, Incorrect and pretty much useless","Don't bother with this book, there are much better books out there. The questions are often awkward and don't seem to match what I ran into on the GMAT. Additionally they teach you stuff which you don't even need for the GMAT. .. For example - the quadtratic formula.. Don't need it!My guess is these books aren't updated as frequently as some of the books by Kaplan/Princeton Review."
2,a reader,"This book did not provide me with adequate material. Questions contain faulty logic, questions are misprinted, and in general, this book was disappointing. Example: One question wanted to know, ""...which of the following conclusions cannot be made?"", giving several conclusions which referred to a passage. The passage stated that trains left NY for NJ every minute, and vice versa. All trains traveled at the same rate. The answer: A train that leaves NY at 4:00 will pass 60 trains before its destination. This is a very confusing answer because while the total number of trains passed on the journey is 120, 60 trains are indeed passed along the way. It is further complicated by the fact that one of the answer selections is none of the above. I sent an email to the co-authors, each replying that the other wrote that question."
2,"Not a great book, but you get what you pay for.",The reading comprehension is poorly designed. The passages are way too long compared with the real test. The questions are too easy and too detail-oriented. Sentence correction is also too easy. CD-ROM is useful but only to a limited degree. Suggest you only use this book when you have too much preparation time before the real test.
3,A good start for people who are preparing for the GMAT,"I would have rated this book a higher score if it were not for the fact that there were many errors in the questions. For example, page 44 question 3, I couldn't get this question right and was very frustrated. Finally, when I looked at the answer explanation, I realized that there were different parameters to the question. There are numerous examples to this problem with the book. I really don't trust that the editors really went through this book. The book does do a good job in laying out the information and rating the difficulty of the math problems."
1,"A horrible, horrible, horrible book","Where do I begin? The book is crawling with gramatical errors, the sentence correction portion of the book was missing the all-important underlined portion of the sentence, and even the book construction was horrid. Some of the pages are falling apart, and it's definitely from the manufacturing process and not from use. The practice tests that are included on the CD look and feel NOTHING like the actual GMAT CAT. Finally, I couldn't stand the way they presented the material. They give you instrucions on math, but give you no indication as to where or how to use it during the test. The most useful information was foundin the first 40 pages of the book, but that is info which is probably included in all other GMAT prep books. Best of Luck!"
1,Very disappointed - would like my money back.,The screen format of the CD practice tests is nothing like the real thing -- 4 or 5 lines at a time. I wanted to practice reading from the screen to get a little faster at it and this was a waste of time to even load the program. Also I thought the reading comp exercises from the book were incomprehensible compared to the GMAT-published excercies. I am hoping to find a way to return the book.
2,unless you are out of excercise books,"I chose the book because its content is pretty accurate, and it has tons of questions. Yet, as I was pratising the tense excercises, I lost my track: the question styles are off GMAT style and many questions seem to be artifically awkard. The book has 5 tests, yet all in the old GMAT format. I especially do not like the software, which has only one test in it and does not resember real GMAT experience.On ...(the webseite), I sorted ""GMAT"" books by ""bestselling""and I found 5 books that fit my needs and have >4.5 stars. These five books have been helpful to my progress! I wish I had logged on ... (the website) and read others' comments earlier. Well.Good luck to you."
4,Know There's More to Apache,"Odds are you're here because you've heard Boomshackalak on about 5 different soundtracks. Then again you just might have heard another cut from this album and liked it. Either way I just want to make sure you know that Apache Indian has a debut album which in many ways is stronger. It dosen't have the broadness of exploration that Make Way has, nor does it have the engineering mastery, but it does have a very heartfelt attempt to express what kind of artist Apache is, and what he is trying to express by bringing Reggae to the Continent. Look into 'arranged marriage' or 'chok there' on his first album ""No Reservations.""Also you might try Shaggys ""Pure Love"" or anything by Dr. Alban."
1,"FELT GENEROUS, SO I GAVE IT 1 STAR","Another typical album from the Apache. The album made me BOOMSHAKALAK all the way to the toilet!!! But giving credit where credit is due, Apache covers some sensitive issues very well indeed. Goes to show, music covers all boundaries, whether it be religious, cultural etc."
3,Good shoes,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
2,OK for fans but not Nick's best,"I purchased this after being fully impressed with From Monday to Sunday and The Apple Bed. I am a Haircut 100 fan as well, but this album unfortunately finds Nick waist deep in the parts of the 80's that we'd like to forget: tinny drum machines, synthesized horn sections, and sacharine mixes. A couple of power pop gems and typical Heyward craft are buried by over-production and gloss. For fans, there are a few great moments, most notably ""Traffic on Fleet Street"", a pretty ballad that showcases Nick's ability to transform a mood into music. But there are others that make me press eject and reach for his more recent releases. Again, diehards ought to get it for the sake of their collections, but the casual fan would better appreciate the Greatest Hits or From Monday to Sunday."
4,"Historically very accurate, great imagery","Being a pediatric resident and having been a medical student here at the Medical College of Virginia, it's good to see a book about the place. Ann McMillan has obviously done her research, with great historical accuracy to make the story even more real. She's also spent a great amount of time painting the scenery of the era, with imagery that is very vivid."
3,hear it!,"I have been searching for this CD, because I have heard a cut or two from it. I can't remember which ones. Would have liked to sample listen to it so I could make up my mind. I am pretty sure this is it, but the song titles don't ring a bell."
4,superstars,George was the best Beatle & this has some of his best work. The others are no two bit players. Fabulous listening.
5,Historically classic,When this album came out it was a remarkable collection of Singer/Songwriter guitarists. This Album contributed to the resurgence of Roy Orbison and new work from him. It also gave Dylan a place to showcase his poetry. All in all some selections are a little cheesy but the historic value more than makes up for it. This is a must have for any Adult Contemporary collection. Also real Songwriters can use it as a great example of collaboration between 5 giants in the industry.
4,Traveling Wilburys Vol 3,Great CD. It is a shame that Roy Orbison and George Harrison are not here to make another volume. Some of the greatest talent in the US made this one.
5,My First Musical Order From Amazon!,I like rock music alot and remember when this group started. After hearing the CD I'm kind of mad at myself for not getting it before.
5,A Tonic for all who listen,"It was with a sense of relief,and pleasure that The Wilburys were welcomed in the late 1980s. Ostensibly, Orbison had gone missing, and the careers of Jeff,Bob and George were, to put it plainly, not garnering much attention. So, a renaissance of sorts, a democratic sprinkling of skills and showmanship, perfectly crafted songs and musicianship, with T Bone in the driver's seat. Dylan and Orbison sound comfortable and to be enjoying the sessions. After a few undistinguished years of religious proseletyzing, this heralded a more initimate channel for me to travel. The Traveling Wilburys Medicine Show is a great sampling of American rock and its sound has stood the test of time without succumbing to a trace of nostalgia."
5,One of the all-time greats,What's left to say? This album is as good as music gets.But when are we going to see the CD?
1,Misleading title,"This book starts off by slamming G.W. Bush, his father and even negatively mentions Ronald Reagan. I expected an objective view and facts but instead read stretched accusations and political conspiracy theories. This book should instead be titled ""Bush vs. Saddam, A biased view from the liberal media"". If you want a laugh then this book is for you. If you want the real truth about Iraq then look somewhere else."
2,poor choice,"Do not bother with this book if you are hoping for anything artistic. I think the photographer just took some shots out of some portfolios and threw them to a publisher. The physical quality of the book is good, but the substace is lacking. I'm returning mine. Go with a classic from Peter Lindbergh instead."
4,"Good read, but not Nesbit's best","The Treasure seekers is a story about a small group of children who try and earn money to help their father (an unsuccessful businessman). The children, along the way, meet lots of characters in turn-of-the-century England. Nesbit really understands children and can write delightfully about them. There are lots of very funny episodes in tbe book.Nonetheless, this is not Nesbit's best work. Enchanted Castle, Five Children and It, Phoenix and the Carpet are better, since they also incorporate magic. This book is also distinctly unPC in some places, for instance in its description of a Jewish character (he's a miserly moneylender), and is to that extent a product of its times."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I read about 25% of the book, then finally dropped it, because I found it rather tiring. :-(I had read ""Five Children and It"" before and thought I might like more book of the author."
2,Uncomfortable Read,"Not sure when this was written ... it might explain the distaste I experienced. Though parts were rather entertaining and endearing, I was reading this to my 5 year old grand daughter and found myself having to edit racist remarks and views much to my surprise and disappointment. If we had not started it and she had not wanted to keep reading I would not have read it and cannot give it a recommendation."
5,Children of the New Forest,"I've read this one. It's by Captain Marryat http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1853261106/qid=1130814728/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-3667137-5119336?v=glance&s;=books&n;=507846A historical fiction of 4 wealthy children left poor orphans during the English civil war. Quality piece of literature, that is. There is also a video of the story."
5,Beautiful,Absolutely beautiful. The liner is reversible and the material is soft to the touch. Working from home I use the Moses basket to keep my newborn with me as I go from room to room without having to wake her and the basket it well made for this purpose.
4,They're getting better all the time!,"Their last album was going to be a hard act to follow, but they succeeded with this record. Check out the classic tracks 4,5 and the brilliant wishaway.........."
5,the biggest book I own,"The book is very well done. Its details well explained, the photography is outstanding. It sits on my table top in my den and is looked at often"
5,Truly Exquisite,"This book is a joy to have. Well written and beautifully illustrated, I found this book a pleasure to own. As a dedicated Benz owner, I can appreciate the attention to detail that exists in this book.This is one of those grand coffee table books that you love to leave out for your guests to enjoy."
1,Not original recordings!,I would like to warn anyone considering the purchase of this CD that it contains no original soundtrack recordings and is largely made up of sythesised re-recordings of unbearable banality. Lai is a glorious composer certainly in the top three french movie composers but this CD is not representative of his genius and is best avoided. Go for the original recording and save yourself the disappointment.
1,Don't buy this CD,"I rushed in and bought this CD because I thought it contained the sound-track music and songs. Well, it did say Francis Lai. Instead I got the very worst elevator music. Its indescribably bad. Don't be fooled. Find the real one and pay more."
1,Not the Original Soundtrack of the Movie,"This is marketed to appear as if it is the original soundtrack of the movie ""A Man and a Woman"", but actually it is a re-recording of some of the movie's music, in English rather than the original French, with some extra music thrown in. The original soundtrack, with the wonderful, romantic music that helped this movie win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, is available under the title ""Un Homme et une Femme"". Don't be fooled."
1,Benefit from my mistake,"I am another person who bought this cd thinking it had the music from the movie. (Which it says it does.) The only recognizable song was the theme song, and although it was recognizable, it was painful to recognize it on this cd. The music is synthesized, and it is absolutely horrible.I really don't know what to do with this cd. Undoubtedly it will end up at the used bookstore, where they will possibly give me a dollar for it.This cd is overpriced, misrepresented, and truly appalling.I hope you can benefit from the mistakes of buyers before you.Spend a few extra dollars and get the original soundtrack!"
2,Ewwwwww...pretty bad,"Horrid, horrible and cheesy...makes you want to smash the CD. The track after Blue Rose is quite possibly the worst song recorded in history. Worst than fingernails screeching across a chalkboard. Kinda reminds me of background music for one of the corny high-kick-and-twirl dance routines on Solid Gold (headband and all). I bought it because of Francis Lai...big, big mistake."
1,Chamunorwa - CD,"The quality of the product is very poor. The last 3 songs do not play. Is it possible to get a replacement and to send this one back? However, the service i.e. response and delivery was good and I am happy with it."
2,I don't use Kingsford anymore.,"I stopped using Kingsford years ago when they changed the product and raised the price. It didn't smell the same, in fact it didn't smell much at all, except for a faint chemical smell. I see that the prices have come down some places, but until I hear they've gone back to the old formula, I won't be buying any. Instead, I'm using Sam's Choice, which smells and behaves a lot like old Kingsford."
4,"Good, but...","BetteNoodles were tasty though salty, but when I got the package every single container for making the noodles was broken."
2,"Noodles were OK, sauce was not good at all","Echoing what some of the other reviewers mentioned, the sauce with this product has a very strong vinger taste/smell. I used less than half of the sauce packet and it still felt that way. The noodles themselves were OK, however without a good sauce to go with them, its really a moot point. I don't recommend this product."
2,Not Worth the Calories,"I've had chow mein before and this is not it. The noodles are Ok although they have a weird texture but like another reviewer said, you have to heat them up first because they're packed together pretty tight. Even after I microwaved according to the package directions, I still had a hard time breaking the noodles up to get everything mixed together. The worst part is the sauce. It tasted like watered down soy sauce and there was a very unpleasant tangy after taste. Yuck! I'm not sure who taste tested these but they need to go back to the drawing board. You can find a much tastier meal than this for 320 calories."
3,Not what I expected--,I was disappointed in this majong game as the reviews I read were so glowing. There are 4 majong games on the cd but only the tradional majong are worth playing. The ringjong and spherejong are pretty lame.The Graphics and color are changeable on the tradional Majong game but in all but a few choices colors and pictures are garish. The display is really large and the 3-D effect is not very good. I had tested a great majong game online at Game House which was much superior to this one.I would give this game 3 stars--better suited to a beginner who isn't chosey about the display.
3,Great book for L.A. visitors...,"... but a bit disappointing for L.A. residents :-( I bought the book because I was hoping to find ""fun and educational places"" to go with my son. Most of the places described we already knew. I would recommend ""Fun and Educational Places to Go with Kids in Southern California"" (Susan Peterson)."
4,Spanish Rosetta Stone - WOW!,It's surprizing how fast you can learn reasonable spainish with this tool - pictures and language together use the reasoning side of your brain - but it's fun too! I've already recomended this system to friends. I got it because my son recommended the Russian version. If you're serious about learning language fast - then Rosetta Stone is for you!
4,"technique seems to work, program not exactly friendly.","I am not a natural to new languages at all, but I seem to be picking up some Spanish here and relatively easily. The teaching technique is quite good.The program takes over the computer which is extremely annoying. There is no way to take a break and check email etc. with this program running. You need to exit the program every time you need to use your computer for anything else. I do not find their user interface very intuitive either, but it does not take long to figure it out so this is of minimal impact."
1,Review of the Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 1,I am not at all happy with this product. The instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive. It was a total waste of my money and time.
3,expected more for that price...,"This program is a very good at thrusting you into a spanish speaking environment, but I think some supplemental materials are necessary. There is no documentation with this program, no vocabulary references - nothing. After a few weeks using this program I finally went out to buy a few books to help me out."
4,Pretty Nice for a Costume,"The costume was shipped quickly. The size ran a little big especially the pants (8-10), but they could be hemmed easy enough. One button fell off the shirt before we even put it on. Again, easy enough to sew back on if the button is not lost. As mentioned in other reviews, this is a costume; not a real uniform, so it is a bit on the thin side."
5,Simply the Best,"Take 6 is the greatest a capella group in the world. The harmonies, the arrangements, the voices, the sound effects, etc. Every single song on this CD is pushed to the absolute limit. There is no room for anyone to do it better. Putting them in a jazz category is doing a disservice. These guys have trancended jazz and gospel. This is just great music."
4,PEACE OF MIND,"VERY GOOD ALBUM, MY FAVORITE SONG IS HE NEVER SLEEPS. INSPIRATIONAL SONG TO THINK ABOUT GOD AND HIS GLORY. MUST BUY FOR JAZZ, GOSPEL AND ACCAPELLA LOVERS."
5,Excellent A-Capella work!,"I've admired these guys since I first saw them in concert in the early 90's. If you've never heard them or don't know if you'd like a-capella songs, try this one. It's worth every penny."
5,Awesome,This CD is the first of Take 6 I heard and have been a fan ever since. Their vocals are awesome! You will not be disapponted!
1,No real insight into Aurora from this greenburg book,"This book has nice pictures, just not enough of them. It gives no insight into Aurora or the rationalization of the pricing valuation structure. After attending Slot Car Swap Meets for the past several years, the book is not even close to the valuation criteria used by diehard collectors. If you use this book to valuate your cars, you will invariable over value common cars, and under value the true rare ones. By the way unless the car is extremly rare, it must be in new condition (not just mint for the age), to have any true collector value at all. Mint for age cars are worthless."
4,"""Acing College"" Insightful, Yet Somewhat Negative","""Acing College"" offered a new perspective of the modern university campus. Dr. Halberstam payed attention to possibly every facet of being a good student. Subjects ranged from cramming to where to sit in the class room. The aspect that I enjoyed the most about this publication was that Dr. Halberstam tries to spark ideas that will make his readers not only better students but better citizens of our global community. The part of the book that I did not enjoy pertained to the honesty of the writing. It was informative and entertaining yet sometimes the wording presented a very negative point of view."
3,Eureka 437AZ Vacuum,It's a nice little vacuum. The only thing I'm not happy with is when you go to empty it all the dirt and debris coagulates around the filter. It doesn't drop into the canister hold itself... It's messy when emptying.Another time I used it and there was no dirt at all in the filter.. so i'm curious as to where all that dog hair went now :)
3,great vacuum if you do not have deep carpets,"Lightweight with plenty of power, this is a great vacuum if you do not have deep carpets. Because it only has two settings, floor & carpet, there is no way to adjust for the height of the carpet. On deeper carpets, it will leave tracks showing the brush strokes. Otherwise, a great buy for the money."
4,Very powerful!,"I ordered this vacuum for my hardwood floors because I thought it would be better than the non-HEPA version. This vacuum is EXCELLENT on carpet, even with tons of pet hair and lint. Lots of suction, easy to maneuver. Its almost too powerful for hard floors and almost sucks particles through the vacuum and out the back rather than up into the bag. Its still the best vacuum I've found (after trying Hoovers and Bissells and Eurekas) and I have high hopes that this will last much longer than the others."
4,Eureka 437AZ Optima Lightweight Upright Vacuum,Purchased the unit for use in our travel trailer. The size is great for storage and power in our unit. The power surprised us! We have used it several times and found dirt we didn't know we had!
3,Be patient.It is a good product,"This is the second Eureka I have purchased..The first one I paid 40 at Walmart on clearance. I got 2 years out of the unit before the wheels fell off..Other than that, it was fine..I purchased another one..It was doomed from day one and I paid twice the price for it..To Amazons credit, the exchange was smooth and fast. I requested the item be returned on Sunday and it arrived Wed night..I returned theirs via UPS(free)..So we shall see if this one is better.Pros: ease of useWeight of productCons: Motor smelled like it was burning after 2 uses, wheels fell off the other one.Wheel construction could use some work.."
1,Was It Bad Luck?--This Died on Me After ~6 Uses,"This vacuum lasted just barely long enough for me to have no option but throw its carcass away and ""eat the loss."" Sure it seems reasonably priced, and there's no disputing that it's lightweight and compact for the suction you get out of it--until it stops sucking. In my 43 years (25 of which include first-hand purchases of vacuums), I've never had a vacuum that died on me as quickly as this one did. Was it just bad luck? If so, then my low rating should be appropriately overwhelmed by high ratings from those who were not so unlucky. As I submit this review, this vacuum currently gets four stars from the Amazon population, so it appears that I was unlucky. Still, buyers beware. If you're as unlucky as me, this vacuum will die more quickly than you can go through a handful of disposable razor blades. May you be luckier."
1,Be warned,"Do you use carpet powder? Do you have pets? Does your floor get dirty? Then this vacuum is not for you. Here's the problems.Carpet powder gets all over the place. Theres a hole at the bottom to create the wind tunnel. Problem is this hole is not covered in any way (Dysons are covered). When you use carpet powder all the powder settles in the hole and whoosh, giant cloud of powder. Pulling the canister out puts dust into that hole and whoosh, giant cloud of dust.Pet hair gets clogged up in the hole. So what does that mean? Your vacuum has no suction when its clogged. You hear the vacuum get louder and louder. If you continue to run the vacuum, the motor will eventually lock up. So if you don't overheat your motor, you can clear the clog up and begin working it again until 2.5 min later you have to clear it up again.Bottom line: Bad for general use. Good for light use as it does have good suction when its not clogged."
1,How convient for eureka,I saw a hundred plus reviews... Bought it.Had it just long enough for the return policy to end..I don't clean that much and I kept the filters clean.
5,"AHJ in Saratoga Springs, NY","Light, powerful and extremely maneuverable. Best vacuum I have ever used, especially considering the inexpensive price. Cleans better than vacuums I paid twice as much for."
4,Good for the price,"We purchased this vacuum because we have a 2700 sq.ft. tri-level home with almost all hardwood or tile floors.We do not have any pets but lots of grandkid traffic.So far it has been a good little machine.It has plenty of power and it's easy to pack up and down the three sets of stairs in or home. It is a very simple vacuum and a little crude in a couple of small details,but what do you expect for that price. For what we almost spent on a dyson we could buy one of these models for each floor of our house! The attacements work great for cleaning furiture and blinds.The only real bad thing I can say is that the power cord is a little to short.For the most part I think we got a good bang for our buck,now we will just see how It holds up."
2,Eureka 437AZ,"The air is blowing out under the bottom front of dust collection can. As a result, the air blows away the dust before the vacuum cleaner sucks the dusts in. To prevent from blowing the dust away, the handle should be held very low, so that the air blows up rather forward to blow the dust away.It is convenient to vacuum the stairs because it is light and the motor is strong."
4,"Small, but right....","I had purchased this as a gift. I was at their house and tried it out. For a small vacuum, it works very well. I will recommend this vacuum for anyone with an apartment, living in a dorm or a small home. It's also a great space saver."
2,Ultimately Disappointed,"On my seconded one. Excellent vacuum: very lightweight and nice features such as great suction, suction-only option for hardwood floors, and simple maintenance of filters. But the plastic rear wheels break after only about 6 months of service (used almost daily to pick-up dog hair from primarily hardwood floors). Bought second one thinking that perhaps it was a fluke since I have never had wheels break with other vacuums; within about 3 months the wheels are starting to break-off. Only two little plastic tabs keep the wheels on. Think twice about buying this product if you are a heavy user. Hope Eureka reads these reviews and redesigns their wheel assembly to be more robust. Excellent product otherwise."
1,Good but short lived.,"I bought this a few years ago and it's worked fine. The problem is that over time with only moderate use (once a week use over a small area) the wheels fall off. There's a plastic tab that keeps the wheels on and it wears out. I took it to the vacuum repair place and they said the only way to fix it was to buy an entire new head which costs about the same as a new vacuum ($80). He said I wasn't the only person who's come in with this problem, and he tells them not to buy the Optima for just this reason."
5,I love this Vacuum!,"I've been using this vacuum for a little over 3 months now in my apartment, and I love it! It has great suction, and has everything you need included. It might not be the best choice if you have a big house with a lot of carpet (the cord is kinda short), but it's perfect for my apartment!"
2,not great....you get what you pay for,"its tiny...its noisy...it picks up dirt better than your old cheap vac...but the filter gets filthy way too fast...then it smells. It has a fan blowing out the front for some reason, that fan blows everything your trying to suck up all over the place, including dust that you wind up breathing in. $50 vacuums just aren't what they used to be, its time to upgrade people. the $80-$100 vacuums are the new cheap vacs..anything less than that is not worth buying."
4,Grest Vac!,"I like this vac. It is powerful and when I use it instead of just leaving the regular vacuum lines you can see the lines of each brush row. It really moves the carpet and not just rolling over it. I admit I cheaped out and brought an Eureka for $24 and almost didn't buy this one because the other one was so bad, but I got what I paid for. I love the little brush to clean my furniture. It works great for my apartment. I would prefer a the bottom to be a little wider."
2,eureka optima,"pros:small, compact, not too heavy, good suction (when filter is new and clean), turbo brush attachment works well when suction is good.cons:squeaky wheels right out of the box, for $100 vac (sears) expected better quality. price.the filter needs a filter. i've tried wrapping it in pantyhose like one reviewer suggested. still it gets dirty fast. i only vacuum a few small rooms w2w low pile carpet no pets no high traffic. it sucks up mostly carpet. i'll try to make something washable and permanent instead of this hepa filter or wrap electrostatic foam filter around it.forward exhaust does not bother me and is not too bad. i may keep it until the wheels come off."
3,"Heavy for daily use,scratches floor",I bought this about 6 months ago for hardwood floors.suction not as much as I expected for 12 amp motor.Hose suction much stronger than floor suction.heavier than expected for day to day use.cleaning the dirt cup is a mess.the plastic wheels scratches the floors. Exhaust part is right above the floor piece and blows all the dirt around if not careful to direct the exhaust air away from dirty floor.I am not a happy camper and still in search of a good one.
4,Great suction on a small sweeper,I purchased this sweeper for my travel trailer. I was very pleased and surprised at the amount of the suction power of this little sweeper. I highly recommend this sweeper to anyone not wanting the bulk and weight of the larger ones.
4,good vacuum for the price,"For only a fraction of what you would pay for a full power vacuum, you get same powerful suction without those I considered good-to-have but non-critical features like auto cord rewind and several extra brush heads. You did need to clean the filter often but I don't mind too much. It's a really good vacuum for those who need one to clean area rugs or small carpeted rooms, and not want to spend too much money."
3,Good little vacuum,Vacuum is good for any area. I have two complaints the cord is a 20 foot cord and it is way too short.The other is the way dog hair collects on the filter it has to be emptied everytime you vacuum. Otherwise it is pretty good.
3,Good machine with some issues,"Pros: Moderately lightweight, very good suction, powerpaw is a great attachment, HEPA filter is a great feature, 30% smaller than the full size upright boss vac, long power cord, brush roll cut off switch.Cons: Wheels don't roll well on carpets (regular or commercial) - this is a big inconvenience, dust cup is hard to empty when a moderate amount of pet hair is involved (it gets stuck between HEPA and plastic housing around the top of the HEPA filter), the hose doesn't stretch well (it is made well though) and easily topples the unit when stretched.Recommendations: Get an appropriate extension hose if possible."
2,"Very bad wheel design, great vac but can't manuever easily","I wanted a light weight, yet powerful vacuum. I initially liked this vacuum. It has great suction power (so much so that, area rugs get stuck to it). I liked most of the features except for its wheels. On my berber carper, it won't move at-all. Pushing it forward causes a lot of hand pain, as suction is powerful with clumsy wheels. I have never had that kind of pain with previous and even heavier vacuum cleaner. I returned this vac to store where I bought it and looking for another light weight model."
1,Just a waste of money,"I bought this vacuum because I was sick of big, heavy, and noisy upright vaccums, but my hope quickly turned to complete disappointment as I started to use this product.Is it lighter than traditional full-size upright vacuums? No way! It's smaller but even heavier than my old big full-size Panasonic upright vacuum!Is it quieter? Not at all. Very noisy!It's worse. My old big Panasonic vacuum moves smoothly on carpets when brush is rotating, but this one is very heavy to move on long-leg carpets even when brush is rotating. I bought this with expectation that cleaning jobs would be easier but the reality is that cleaning jobs have become harder with this product!The manual is very poor and you have to do guesses and some trial and errors to understand how it actually works.I feel I was betrayed and will never buy Eureka products again."
1,Eureka 437AZ Terrible Product from the Start,"I live in a small condo and needed a vacuum that would not take up too much space but be able to successfully clean my three Oriental area rugs as well as my Pergo floor. In spite of mostly decent reviews, with a sprinkling of negative ones,this Eureka 437AS was a disaster from the get-go! After the initial vacuuming, my attempt to put the cleaning cup back into the vacuum (at least 1/2 hr. worth of tries) was impossible to accomplish. Also, the seams of the part seemed to buckle. I had actually used a Shark for two years, not an especially effective product, but the Shark was way ahead in usability than this disaster. Returned it the next day. Beware this useless vacuum cleaner!Eureka 437AZ Optima Lightweight Upright Vacuum"
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I am very unhappy with this vacuum cleaner. I read a positive review in Real Simple magazine, and positive comments on Amazon. But I think it proves the old adage ""You get what you pay for."" I should have saved up the money to buy a Dyson or a Miele. My major complaint is that the dirt very quickly clogs up the HEPA filter. So I have to dig around in the filter in order to get the dirt out of it -- which means dust is flying around in the air. I have a chronic lung problem which is why I bothered with a HEPA filter to begin with. But now I'm sure I'm breathing in a lot more dust than if I could simply dump the dirt in the garbage. AND I have to clean out the dirt canister after I vacuum each room. Otherwise the dust flies around while I'm vacuuming. I'd rather have a vacuum bag.The other (minor, but still irritating) issue is that the cord is really too short."
4,Filter Clog,"The onboard attachments are a great improvement over the small Boss that I did have (the handle broke on that). The only complaint I have is that the filter gets covered in the dirt and hair that is picked up. The canister does not receive much at all. Now granted, I have two dogs who shed. I just wish the filter would not get clogged up."
3,"Good cleaning, lightweight is misleading","This vacuum was priced attractively at $75. The cleaning is very good for a lightweight vacuum on carpet. THe problem is it is very difficult to push. This was surprising given it's lightweight advertising. It does not have a feature that helps it roll apparently. It is harder to push than our regular, 15 pound vacuum. I am tall and maybe that makes it worse but I had to bend over to lower the handle enough to where it would be manageable to push. Great for carrying up and downstairs and everything else is good."
1,a lesson in you get what you pay for,"I liked the light weight so overlooked the downsides, like that it blows air out the front (fun to chase the blowing-around dog hairs, we get our exercise where we can...) and that the cord was too short. But, it completely died after less than 2 years. Trashed it and bit the bullet and bought a Shark. The Shark was just delivered and is still in the box, no rush on the cleaning thing, but it does have a 5 year warranty so I figure the cost per year will be less than the Eureka piece of junk. Like my BFF said, vacuum cleaners don't get used all that much in my house (I prefer to be called ""domestically challenged"") so if it lasted less than 2 years for me..."
3,"Hard to clean filter, hard to move over thick carpet","My elderly, petite mother got one of these as a gift, hoping for a lightweight machine. It's a bit too heavy for her, and it is hard to push across thick carpeting. She said emptying the canister and keeping the filter clean is difficult and dirty work. I think the filter is accordion folded, so getting dirt out of the crevices is a pain. She now wants a bagged machine that's easier to use.Update 2011: I got her the Eureka S3681D Sanitaire Mighty Mite canister model with bags, and she's much happier with it. It's very lightweight and easier for her to change the bags than to clean a bagless."
1,Good for one vacuum,"This vacuum had great suction the first time we used it, but gradually began losing it immediately thereafter. We washed the filter every time after use but I think you can't get it clean enough. It used to perform a little better after a filter wash. Now, less than a year later, no amount of washing can fix it. I do not recommend this vacuum to anyone, especially if you have pets."
1,NOT DESIGNED FOR HARD-WOOD FLOORS!,"When you think of a Eureka product, you would normally think about a high-quality engineered product. NOT IN THIS CASE...!!!The air discharge from the unit blows on the area that your about to clean. This discharge blows dirt & dust all over the place, if, your using it to clean hard-wood floors. After you use this for a period of time, you'll notice that you will have excessive dust build-up on your tables & furniture.Save yourself some money and buy a leaf-blower. It will be much faster and you can use it outdoors!"
2,From someone whos had it more then a week!,"This vacuum lasted me 2 years. I did not use it daily, only WEEKLY or sometimes BI-weekly! I live in an small apartment, so no up stairs or down stairs.I do not have children nor do i have dusty neighbors trying to borrow my Eureka either.It was a slow death i must say, after a few months(about 6 or so) the vacuum started to pick up less & less. After about 15 months the Eureka was like a cool robotic broom. It picked up what it could. Then finally after 2 years she died. I used the power paw for my cats tree, nothing else but my cats tree..and that died after a year.Another thing that i want to mention, this vacuum is HARD to clean! On Amazon(pre-purchase) I read some reviews mentioning this too but i didnt listen because I thought to myself ""Oh it cant be that hard, I like to clean"". UHHH no! Cleaning the filter was like an entire different chore.So take it from someone that have used this vacuum for more then one happy week, it sucks."
5,Great little vac Eureka 437AZ,"I recieved the vac yesterday, and took it out of the box, attached the parts, and started vacuuming dog hair from my indoor-outdoor carpet on my porch. What a great little machine Eureka has invented, and it is so easy to unscrew the cap and remove the dog hair from the tube. The machine is so light-weight, and because of back problems, I don't need a bulky heavy machine to drag around. This is just perfect for my vacuum cleaning needs. Thanks for your great product. You have such speedy delivery also, and that is a big plus in my book. Will be telling my friends and family about your great service."
3,"small, powerful, heavy","More powerful than other small vacuums we've had, so that is a plus for the cat hair. Its on the heavy side for my wife. The only complaint is emptying of the dust collection section could be easier. We use in a 2-bedroom apt with 2 cats."
4,good power but,this little vacuum does a good job of cleaning but if you have pets thatshed the filter will clog up soon unless you clean it out once a week.cleaning it you will need another vacuum to get crud out of filter and you will need to spray WD 40 oil around edges of top to get it off easily next time you empty it.
3,Scratches hardwood floors,"The front part of the base ahead of the brushes has hard plastic ridges that scratch my hardwood floors. I have tried to wrap, glue, screw,.....something soft over them but have not yet succeeded. If it were not for this it would be a great little machine."
4,Light and powerful Vacuum,"Really happy with this Vacuum cleaner. I've had multiple people tell me that they were surprised by how light it was, yet it is still very powerful. Also pretty easy to empty and comes with a mini brush spinning attachment for stairs and what not. Only complaint I guess I have is that the hose tends to clog occasionally. Otherwise the vacuum works great!"
4,Great Suction for something so small,"Recently purchased this little vac from Amazon. Love the suction, size & adjustable handle. the adjustable handle makes storage in my closet so much easier. Great value for the money. Thanks Amazon. I did not give it a five because the wheels are the only negative I find so far. They are rather cheap & flimsy. They do not roll well & have rough spots on them. Worry about them scratching my hard wood floors over time."
5,Eureka 437AZ Optima,Is an excellent product. The best among small vacuum cleaners. This is the second purchase of the same item in the last 10 years.
1,eureka vacuum model # 437az,MY RECOMMENDATION TO YOU IS TO STOP SELLING THIS PRODUCT !!!! ITS KINDA HARD TO USE WHEN THE WHEELS KEEP FALLING OFF !!!!!! EUREKA HAS ALREADY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT PART AND 6 MONTHS LATER THERE FALLING OFF AGAIN... I WOULD HAVE NEVER ORDERED FILTERS FROM AMAZON IF I HAD KNOWN THE WHEELS WHERE GONNA FAIL AGAIN !!! SIGNED I AM VACUUMLESS !!!!!!Eureka 437AZ Optima Lightweight Upright Vacuum
1,Waste of Money,"I have owned this vacuum for 5 months and it does not do the job. For one thing, once the brush gets any hair or fur in it, it stops picking things up. 2nd it does not work on bare floor. There is a hose attachment with a rolling brush for stairs, the brush stopped working. I am very dissapointed with the product and wish I never bought it.Don't go by the reviews from people that have had it for a week or two, ofcourse it will work good when it's brand new, that's what I did and now I know how it really works, or doesn't work."
2,Junk! Don't waste your money,"I bought this at Costco to have a as second vacuum. I liked the idea of the tiger paw to clean the stairs. After about 3 uses the tiger paw stopped spinning if you put any pressure at all on it. The cord is way too short. I have to replug 3 times in just 1 room! The cannister fills up very quickly and all of the dust collects around the top of the filter. Cleaning the filter is not the easiest task and is a pretty dirty job. While using it on my hardwood floors, I see it blowing dust, hair, etc. away from the vacuum. It really isn't a very good vacuum at all. I would only reommend this to people in very small apartments who do not have pets and don't mind cleaning a filter every 5 minutes."
4,Great little vacuum!,"After extensive research, I bought this vacuum based on the reviews.I would have to say they are accurate. It has been 2 years now and the vacuum still works great. It certainly isn't magic, or especially powerful, but it is light, dependable, cheap, and works perfectly fine.The power claw thing broke at the 1.5 year mark, but I hardly ever used it. I think it was for steps or drapes or something. It might even be fixable, it just doesn't spin anymore.Standard vacuum cleaner troubles apply (ie. you have to cut strings off the brush when it gets caught, the filter needs to have hair pulled off it every once in a while, etc.), but I don't regret my purchase.Would buy again!"
2,don't buy it,"I got this vacuum because I read that it was light weight, not too noisy, and did a good job picking up dirt. I found it very difficult to push on my carpets. By the time I was done vacuuming my apartment, my back was really hurting. It feels like it has the brakes on. I tried to return it, but found that some of the pieces that had to be assembled when I purchased it, wouldn't come apart--thus I was not able to ship it back as it was shipped to me."
2,Loved It...At First,This is one handy little vac...Eureka really made a cute tool. The problem is it shots more dust back into the air. I didn't realize at first why the kids and I were getting so many sinus attacks...but now that I'm using my 10-year old Hoover again we are clearing up. I wish Eureka would take this model just a little further and put a bag in it that will catch the fine dust. It is also very difficult to clean the filter because it gets so matted with nasty stuff.I'm currently shopping for another vac...this time with a bag (the thrill of cleaning out the dust cup crevices lasts only 2-3 weeks tops).
4,As advertised,"This is just what it says on the box, a small, lightweight yet powerful vacuum cleaner. Cleaning out the dirt is not too much of a hassle, it's better than having to buy bags. The filter seems to do its job very effectively. The only negative point worth mentioning is that it is quite loud. Still, a good buy, especially for the price."
4,"So far, so good","The suction is great. It is a very light vacuum: easy to pick up and move, but a little more difficult to push while in operation than I'd expect of a vacuum this light. Very easy to empty the canister (I love that I don't have to purchase bags or throw bags away) and reasonably easy to clean the filter, though both processes are a little messy. I've had success on stairs, area rugs, and hardwood floors. Other consumers have stated that cleaning on hardwood is challenging because the vent in the front of the vacuum blows the dirt on the floor in front of the vacuum around. This is true until you recline the handle, and then it was not a problem for me. I am very happy so far and will be extremely pleased if the vacuum holds up well."
4,Pretty good machine,"The vacuum has lots of power and suction (it really cleans well),is lightweight and good in small spaces, easy to assemble, adequate cord length, and quiet. However, removing/replacing the filter lid is difficult. The plastic threaded lid is poorly made. Even when the lid is aligned properly for removal/replacement, it will hardly budge. the filter canister and lid are lightweight plastic, so I can see a real potential for breakage when dealing with the lid. BE CAREFUL. Also, be sure you remove and clean the filter outside. The dirt/dust erupts from the thing. I haven't had the vacuum very long, so can't comment on durability. If it holds up and if I can finally master the filter lid, I think I will be glad I have it. I also recommend buying from Amazon. I find them much easier to deal with in event of product failure.(I am not affiliated with Amazon, that is just my experience)"
4,IT SUCKS!!!,"Move over DYSON! This vac is sleek, powerful, light-weight and CHEAP. I've never had such a clean house till I found this vac. So far my only gripe is with the short power cord. Overall it is a great vac."
1,Laguiole Steak Knives,We had previously purchased a set of these knives from a different vendor a few years ago and needed more. The old ones were fine. This set was awful. They could not cut a straight line and were amazingly dull. I sent them back.
3,Eh.. Not What I Expected..,"I've been using John Frieda on and off for a few years now. Mainly, I use the shampoo and conditioner when I get a good coupon :)I currently am using this shampoo with Shine release and volumizing for all shades of brown. I was hoping it would add some life to my dull brown hair. I recently went from bleach blonde to my natural espresso and it has been fading. It looks dull and dry. Instead of re-dying it and damaging it more, I was hoping this shampoo would add some life. It smells great, makes my hair super clean, but I don't agree that it adds shine and life to your hair. It doesn't bring any color back to it either. It is just like any other shampoo. It cleans my hair, but that's about it. I will continue to use it when I get a good coupon here and there, but I wouldn't go out of my way to spend a few extra bucks when it is just like Pantene or any other brand out there."
2,AGREED WITH DEBBIE,"SNIP SNIP, CUT AND CLIP. The muscle is lost in this 60s anthology of young TED NUGENT AND THE AMBOY DUKES. I would like to add that this poor recording sounds one-dimensional and un-layered. The Smashing Pumpkins site Ted Nugent as an influence - it is a good thing they never heard this. I would never want my boyfriend to play this in the car - we would probably never stop because we would want to get home so fast! Unlikely parking music."
1,Agree with Debbie; crucial passages are missing.,"Agree with Debbie. Crucial passages (the bass solo and jazz organ break in ""Prodigal Man"" have been deleted [if only Ihad perfect pitch I could recall them from memory]) but at least the gist of the music is there. I was so disappointed though, that I returned it for a refund and am looking for the LP version."
3,"Full version of ""Prodigal Man"" is found on CD","For all those disappointed, including myself, about the cut version of Proigal Man on this CD, it is now found on the new Best Of CD ""Loaded For Bear"""
4,Excellent sound on CD. Ted Nugent really rocks the house.,"Album came alive on CD. Unfortunately the entire version of Prodigal Man was not included. It got hacked. Why? So we could hear 'Sobbin in My Mug of Bear'? What a letdown. I agree that the quality could have been better, but nonetheless it was good to hear these tunes on CD cranked up."
4,Amboy Dukes - 'Migration' (Repertoire),"Originally released in 1969, this was the Detriot hard rock band's third effort. Can't believe I've never gotten around to checking out any of their work prior to this, at least not an entire album. Tunes here I found myself appreciating the most were the opening title track ""Migration"", ""Inside Outside"", ""Loaded For Bear"" and the two really great added bonus cuts, the inspiring ""J.B. Special"" (would be fun to cruise to) and ""Sobbin' In My Mug Of Beer"". Line-up: Ted Nugent-guitar&vocals, Rusty Day (of Cactus, R.I.P.)-percussion&vocals, Greg Arama-bass&vocals, Steve Farmer-rhythm guitar&vocals and Dave Palmer-drums. Should draw in long-time fans of Blue Cheer, Count Five, Iron Butterfly, Deviants, MC 5 and possibly the Easybeats. I have to wonder, do these guys ever reunite in any form?"
1,This company has no respect for its users,"This is a fine product until you upgrade past a version that uses a different file format. Then, very little will work. The company doesn't tend to write very good utilities that upgrades from one file format to another. For example, version 5 to 6 was a disaster. we had to rewrite everything. You couldn't just upgrade."
4,Provides a good exegesis from the greek text.,Word Biblical commentaries are good in general for their interaction with the origianl languages and their analysis of the form of the text. O' Brien has a good overview of the hypothesises for the writng of colossians.
3,Great content marred by formatting,"The commentary itself is excellent - O'Brien is consistently insightful and helpful - but the formatting of this commentary is absolutely atrocious. What do the editors of the WBC have against footnotes? Why did they think that three or four line parentheses separated by half a line of text was an acceptable way to handle O'Brien's style? Frequently a single sentence is interrupted by two or more parenthetical remarks which should have been placed in notes, and the reader struggles to follow the author's argument. If you can overcome this problem, the commentary is worth your time."
1,wrong information,"the product description says 6"" (six inches). These came today and they are 6' (six feet). that is a ripoff, i bought this with the understanding it was a short ""y"" type adapter. not so. buyer beware."
5,This book has remained in my mind for twenty plus years.,"I read this book back in the 70s while living on an Indian Reservation. The book brings to light very real problems but does so with laughter. The laughter runs the gamut from the giggle type to the roll on the floors with tears running down your face type. The book catches the nuances of problems faced by Native Americans, and does so without ""preaching"" about solutions or causes. It is a marvelous book. When it is re-issued, it will once again, have it's place of honor in my book case."
5,A Must Read,"I first read this book in high school and I fell in love with it! It's been over 20 years, and I still chuckle when I think about Flap, Eleven, H-Bomb and all the other unforgettable characters and their many wild and crazy adventures. I've since married into a Native American family, and I realize that many of the problems that the author pointed out with humor back then still exist is some degree today. Crude language not withstanding, I think that this is a great book and should be a must read for anyone with a social concience."
5,the best book i ever read,"read the book back in 70's. still remember vividly many charecters(all immensely lovable),especilly Flap& H-Bomb.been trying to get a copy eversince...a must-read for everyone ."
4,A Field Guide for Horse Spotters,"It is remarkable how compactly all necessary information can be expressed when you just know how to do it. Carole Knowles-Pfeiffer has managed to distill all that is essential and currently known about horse colour on delightfully few pages. The ideas are illustrated with excellent photos so that one can immediately see what is meant by each colour factor.The Allen Photo Guide form is excellent for a spotter's guide. You can take the guide along onto the fields and stables, and compare horses that you see with the pictures in the book. And surprisingly enough you most often will end up with a colour definition. - Not always, but that most certainly is not Carole Knowles-Pfeiffer's fault: we still are far from knowing everything about horse colour.An excellent book to browse and acquire basic info on horse colours. In an easy an relaxed manner."
4,Pet Agree,"The product was as described. I realized after using the pet agree a few times it was not phasing my barking dog as it was at first. I began holding the button down a little longer and walla, no more barking. So for those of you have not had much luck with this product, try holding the ultra sonic sound for a few more seconds."
3,Is my dog just really stubborn,"So far pet agree has not make much of a differance in my dog Zoe. Sometime she will respone to pet agree and other times she acts like she doesn""t hear a thing. I am not giving up."
2,Not Worth The Money,"After reading all the reviews, I thought I would see if this would help me train my dog (corgi). He can hear it for sure, however all it does for him is make him bark and lunge for the unit. I'll continue to try to get better luck with this (maybe in time)."
1,is my dog deaf or is the device faulty?,"After reading the reviews, I ordered the petagree training device, thinking that my experience would mirror other customers' success. However, unless my dog is deaf (highly unlikely since he can hear the dog treat box rustle from yards away) then this device is a hoax. Not only have I tried in all sorts of situations (outside, inside, within 3 -5 feet and in increments up to 20 feet), but my dog exhibits absolutely no response to the supposedly intense sound.Since the device was under $35 including shipping, I assume that it's just another completely ineffective, though marketable, device sold to unsuspecting yet eager dog trainers.Avoid the device at all costs. My guess is that the favorable customer reviews were written by the company who is passing off these items as legitimate."
4,The Design Business or Freelance,"This is a good book for if you are wanting to start your own business in design or if you are doing some freelance work. It covers such things as how to save money when you are getting started, contracts, and working with clients. Some of the material is dated, but nonetheless, it is still a good book for the designer who is wanting business information."
4,Good flavor but too thick,So Hot Kid! Makes these rice crackers for infants called Baby Mumums.My brother keeps eating my daughters crackers. I must admit they are very tasty (especially the veggie flavor)So I've been searching for an adult rice cracker thats similar.These crackers were close. They are just too thick. Thats the only problem. If they were 1/2 or even 2/3 as thick they would be better. The flavor is sort of soy saucey. Its a good flavor. But i'm still searching for an adult rice cracker as good as a Baby Mumum (but hopefully less expensive by oz)
5,Classic Sample!,This is definitely one of if not Joe Sample's best work as a solo jazz artist during post Crusaders. Al Jarreau and Take 6 really top this classic jazz album off. I'm just glad to have it on cd. Way to go Joe!
5,Great stands,"I purchased a set of these from a local retailer, at a higher cost, then ordered these. They are sturdy and well constructed. Included are many mounting brackets to accommodate different speaker configurations. I like the fact that they are well balanced and don't have to worry about them tipping over. The wire is hidden inside the stand. Friends have made positive comments and asked where we got them and wanted some for themselves."
5,Works Great,"I was impressed with their sturdiness. I bought two of them for the rear speakers of my Sony 5.1 surround system. They included many different options for attaching the speakers which should make it easy for most speakers to be attached. The most time-consuming part of the installation was threading the speaker wire through the stand due to the curve. Other than that, these are great speaker stands at a great price."
4,Decent solution for surround speakers.,"I originally looked at these in Best Buy, but the price on Amazon was so much better!Construction was easy. Directions were good. My only complaint was that the stands cold have been a little taller."
4,It is what it is,"Does it's job, holds the speakers. I have the popular Sony HTIB S370 which has small satellite speakers. The stands hold the speakers well, and keep them off the floor. These stands are very adjustable, but are difficult to get 'just right'. They don't stand out too much. The counter weights and carpet spikes are great for stability. I'm not afraid of knocking these over. It was a little difficult to thread the speaker wire through the stand."
3,Seemed like a good product but mine was flawed.,"These look nice and seem to be made of study high quality material. I had problems with one of my stands. It initially came slightly bent at the screw. I was able to get to screw in with a lot of time and strength. The second stand assembled in a snap. I ran out of speaker wire and wasn't able to finish the project. After I bought wire and tried to assembly it I had troubles threading the wire through the stand. After disassembling the stand to run the wire through, it wouldn't reassemble correctly. A part of the stand came off and got stuck in the base. The stand is no longer adjustable in height. The other stand has worked flawlessly. Also, on of the rubber feet pads don't fit snugly and fall out easily when moving the stand. Had problems with mine, but most likely I had a defective product."
5,Gets the job done for Energy RC-Micro's,"Subject says it all. Pretty simple to put the back speakers in with the screws included in the Energy RC-Micro's package (I didn't use the actual speaker stands screws they give so don't know how well they would've worked). I currently have them on our kitchen tile floor, so I also can't say how well those sharp carpet bottom holders work, but the rubber grips for the tile work well and keep them in place for the most part. I've got a little 1 year old crawling and running around in his walker that can move them with some effort if he grabs on to it and shakes them enough, but it does take effort for him to actually move them completely out of their place.Only real negatives I could think of is the black paint"
2,Not impressed,"Build quality felt pretty good, but when I put this together one of the clasps used to hold the pole up wouldn't stay. Also, at maximum height (which isn't very high) it felt kind of shaky. I am sending it back."
5,Great speaker stands!,"I received these speaker stands very quickly from TheFactoryDepot. Assembly was very easy. They are sturdy, with very heavy metal bases and they also look great. You won't go wrong with these stands!"
4,Good speaker stands,I like these stands because of the foot because it keeps the stand from tipping over and it will fit in any space.
4,Sleek and Quality,These made my Logitech 5.1 system look so much better. They come with feet attachments for both carpet and wood floor which is nice for acoustic value. Dust clings a little bit because of surface texture but is removed easy.
4,Many Good Mounting Options,Good quality. A lot of different options for mounting different speakers. Stability on carpet is good but not excellent.
2,Poor quality,"These stands are very poor quality for the price. You can purchase much better quality stands for the same price or less, like the Omni Mount stands. I purchased these stands and screws stripped on first use. The part that tightens the two poles together to make them adjustable is plastic and will fail sooner or later as others have noted. I would not recommend purchasing these stands. Should you do so anyhow the biggest wire that will fit through them is 14 Gauge and only the smallest satellite speakers should be mounted on them. Beware though any pet could easily knock them over."
3,Good speaker stand,These are good speaker stands for the money. They will only support speakers that are low in weight.
1,Not Compatable with Bose 321 System,"Don't get me wrong, these are very nice speaker stands. However, they are not compatable with the Bose 321 Speaker System. The bracket to attach to the speakers must be modified before use (and I mean cutting metal)and since Bose uses a wiring harness, you must cut the wire before you can feed it through the hollow tubes. I was just not willing to do all that when I can buy the overpriced Bose stands and not have to modify anything. I called Customer Service at Sanus and the guy I spoke with was nice but completely oblivious to what I had to say. He told me it shouldn't be that expensive to have a machine shop cut the brackets down to size and that if I didn't mind hacking through my speaker wire and taping them back together, it should not have any effect on the sound. HUH??"
4,Works with Energy Take Classic,"These stands worked with Energy Take Classic, using the screws that came with the stands. I tried Atlantic stands and did not find a good option to mount the speakers.Use the L shaped bracket. The bolt goes into the mounting hole below the keyhole and above the terminals. The vertical side in the L goes against the speaker. The horizontal side in the L goes on top of the speaker stand pole. The terminals are below the elbow of the L. If you want a perfect fit, you can put a couple of 1/2 inch SAE washers between the L bracket and the mounting hole. They should cost less than a dollar for say a set of 8."
5,Excellent Product,"I am impressed with these stands. The bases are nice and heavy, which help to reduce knock overs, especially if you have kids in the house. I especially like the fact that the bases are narrow, so they fit nicely in tight spaces."
4,Sturdy stands with nice looks,Stands are sturdy. Gliding wire through the stand was little bit tricky but overall it is an easy install.
2,"Poor quality manufacturing, pieces didn't fit together properly on one stand","Disappointed in the manufacturing quality. One stand fit together just fine, but the second stand the upper pole was made such that the diameter was slightly too large. I had to use considerable force and sand some pieces down to get it to fit together and it still doesn't fit properly."
1,very disappointed,"another reviewer raved about the fragrance but i find it overbearing. also, the label on the front says it is hypoallergenic but as it contains perfume and several other chemical ingredients clearly listed on the back label, i don't see how this can be true. and the coup de grace, is that the front label also claims it is made from italian virgin olive oil but this is not listed on the ingredients; instead it says it has potassium olivate--this just might be the chemical name for olive oil, but it sounds odd to me. anyhow, the bottom line is that this is not a pleasant soap to use. i recommend savon de marseilles, which i also bought on amazon several months ago and which i am going back to."
1,questionable ingredients,The claim to be made from 100% olive oil is a bit misleading and it has the preservative Bht listed in its ingredients on the label of the bottle. Is Bht supposed to be the antioxidant? hmmm The 100% olive oil ingredient is really a derivative of olive oil (potassium olivate-a salt of olive oil fatty acids)and not just plain olive oil. It's very perfumed (and it doesn't smell like a natural fragrance would) so buyer beware. Anti-aging properties? hmmm again.
5,if you feel lonesome...,"... it's sound is for you. It's amazing. Michel Legrand will be always the best. If you like the soundtrack of the film ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", you should try this one. (I don't say Sting is poor, but sometimes original is better)"
1,HR Professionals only,"Perhaps a great resource for HR and Compensation professionals, this book is not helpful to managers or executives who need help with their compensation practices. No practical information, much more of an academic review of the world of compensation."
2,Save your money!,"Save your money!! This is the most superficial book on complex subject of the history of U.S.-Vatican relations ever written! Without the slightest doubt, a High School senior would have done a better job on both the subject matter - and on the prose! In effect, from the author's own admission, it would seem that he did not take a step in the diplomatic field without first consultling his spouse. In addition, he seems to have had her accompany him to most of his major diplomatic meetings! Let us hope Ambassador L. Boggs will do a better job describing her mission at a key U. S. diplomatic post at the end of her tenure in Rome!"
4,"Not Steinman, but not bad...","Actually, there are a handful of songs on here that show Meat off as well as Steinman songs do. The title track (a duet with Patti Russo) is the crown jewel of the album, and is very reminiscent of ""I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth)."" ""Testify"" and ""Did I Say That?"" are the runners-up; both are up-tempo, heavily-orchestrated, wall-of-sound type pieces.Honorable mentions go to ""Forever Young"" and ""Man of Steel"" (the latter a duet with daughter Pearl). None of the other songs are tremendously memorable, but all were good, solid tunes. (""Do It"" is my least favorite track; it seemed to go nowhere -- but the basic material was good.)The bonus CD is not really worth commenting on. Luckily, the album is good enough to not need the bonus material.A good album after a long wait! (But still leaves the question: when do we get Bat III?)"
2,Bat Out Of Steinworld,"Ok ! This is another ""Welcome to the Neighborhood"" project where Meat couldn't have said it better himself just because he can't...Starting from the beginning""...And you said nothing at all...""""...I'd lie for you and thats the truth...""with the usual acoustic duet right after the middle of the song...Nothing really new, means nothing really true...I consider Meat Loaf as one of the greatests rock singers of all time due to his incomparable vocals. But this is not enough especially when he definatelly doesn't sound like BAT II or every past work of his.This album states the Truth that Meat can only prevail on ""Steinworld"" and there is where he really belongs...Keep on dreaming of the BAT III...THE FINAL AT BATS!"
1,Crapuscule,It would have been great if the author had someone proofread the book before publishing.Halfway through the book the locale switches to Seattle when they were in Paris and a character's name changes from Marick to Marc and back again.Waste of time.
4,Digging deep,"Monder can wander far off the beaten path into fascinating progressive ambiance which may alienate more traditional-leaning jazz guitar aficionados, but this alluring language the fluid musician has seemingly pioneered himself always seems to justify any excess by the end."
5,BEN MONDER: IS HE A PERSON?,"Excavataion, Ben Monder's latest, makes me feel like sleeping for 20 years, and that's not to say that it's boring! In actuality, I have fallen asleep many times while both listening and not listening to this disc. But let's just say that Ben is pushing the envelope. Well, I hate expressions that mean nothing; so let's just say that this is a great disc for post-modern, spiritually-deprived human beings and also those who like music. Stop laughing."
1,Dissatisfied,"This disc is in poor condition and would not download properly. I have wanted this game for a long time, and was so disappointed that it was faulty. I did not return it because of the cost to do so. I will have to remember not to buy from this group again."
5,The coolest numbers...,"I was introduced to the Fibonacci numbers in college, and really hadn't given them much though till recently.This is a very good, informative and entertaining (I mean, as far as math books go!) little volume that I have found useful in my quest for personal research on this subject.The book is in great shape, very fast delivery...what more can you want?Recommend..."
2,"Knew I was buying junk, but...","Okay, my bad for buying these despite the bad reviews. I planned to use these for wiping down greasy, gunpowdery handguns. Once you've used a piece of cloth for that, it's pretty much toast - you throw it away when done. These seemed cheap enough that I wouldn't feel bad about tossing them afterward. I thought, just how bad could these things be that they wouldn't be usable for at least wiping down greasy metal? Well, considering that they're almost the consistency of burlap, they're not usable for much at all. Yes, they are almost as coarse as burlap (okay, not quite as coarse, but certainly reminiscent of burlap), and pretty stiff and scratchy. I'll try to come up with some use for these things, but it's going to be tough.Probably should have purchased some of the shop cloths sold here that are apparently just chopped up tee shirts. Tee shirts and other such cottony things are much better for final wipedowns on guns."
1,This is an Inferior Product,"I rarely find myself compelled to comment on products purchased on the web (even though I usually read the reviews others have written before purchasing) and Amazon usually sells good stuff, but these rags are so bad I felt I HAD to say something. I ordered them to use in my motorbike shop and, frankly, I cannot find one use to justify keeping them. They are abrasive, coarsely woven, non-absorbant, non-colorfast and they leave lint on everything they touch; in a word, they are JUNK. Don't waste your money, buy something else or use paper."
4,good,"They are shop towels, they work well for cleaning up spills, wiping hands and messes in general. they are machine washable."
3,EH.,They were rags. They weren't as thick as I would have liked. Shipping was fast. I guess I expected them to be better quality.
1,Stitched like a potato sack,"What more can I say, this is literally stitched like a potato sack which I cannot think of any use for. Literally went right into the garbage upon inspecting the towels."
4,Shop Towels,What can you say about shop towels? I got 25 of them for a reasonable price and they seem to be of good quality for what I use them for. Seller shipped quickly.
1,Get A Grip,"This item was shipped in the shelf box, not a packing box and arrived in pieces. Never got to cook in it though. Does not appear to be well constructed."
1,Do not recommend at all!,"I bought a couple of these at Whole Foods, couldn't finish the first one, and threw away the second. They do not even resemble food. Ramen kicks their butt. Absolutely disgusting. Ew. Gross. Don't waste your money the way I did!"
1,Worst Food Product I've Ever Purchased,"How badly can someone mess up teriyaki flavoring? This noodle bowl is the least edible thing I've ever tasted. I'd compare the taste to Vegemite/Marmite and those Halloween blood capsules, and the smell to a burnt capacitor. After one bite I went outside to throw it out, I didn't want it stinking up my indoor garbage can. I have never been compelled to call a 'satisfaction guaranteed' hotline, but if Annie Chun's had one I'd be on the phone right now. After this disaster I nuked a Annie Chun's Spicy Szechuan which was a huge improvement, actually edible."
3,Good If You Are in A Rush,"I will say its okay, but what I would say is that it is a little salty. So if you need to watch blood pressure just be careful."
4,Annie Chun does noodles right,"The flavoring still needs work, but man oh man are the noodles themselves good. I'd love a little more of something besides the soy sauce. However they are super fast and the noodles are FANTASTIC, so I will probably keep eating them and hoping someone gets around to tweaking the flavoring. Also hopefully lowers the sodium a bit because while I LOVE sodium packed/bad for me items (I can honestly eat 2 packs of Ramen noodles without an issue), but in this item it alters the taste for me. I'm guessing if you're someone that packs on the soy sauce (I use a reduced sodium on a regular basis), this won't bother you at all."
1,AVOID this product!,"They must have changed this product since previous reviewers said it was good: I just tried it for the first time and it was HORRIBLE! After following package directions, had to add some water and re-microwave to soften up the noodles, which were FAR from ready to eat--the sauce packet is not enough to moisten them sufficiently. And then, it tasted terrible. What a disappointment. I have been eating Maruchan for quite awhile--not great--but WAY better than this!"
5,Wonderful music,"Awesome music. Love Michael Talbot's singing. There is something veryspecial about it all. Of all my music collection, I rank this CD top of them all.Many years ago I was given a tape with the music. Replaced it becauseI listen to it so often & downloaded it onto my iphone, too."
2,Light works. Mounting bracket is almost completely useless.,"The mounting bracket does not fit my bike. I have a KHS Flight 100 which I imagine is pretty standard because I have met several other people with them. The handle bars where there is no grip tape is too small for this mounting bracket and the light just barely stays on. It flops around when I ride and points at the ground most of the time. It satisfies the legal requirement for having a light, but in most ways it is not very helpful. I think a better mounting bracket would be made of metal or fit smaller sizes. The actual light seems like it is made well which is a shame because all the work put into the light is wasted when I spend all my time riding worrying about if this light will stay on my handle bars and where it will be pointing after the next bump in the road."
2,Not bright enough,"Bought this light to replace an older bike light that I have, I did not do enough research for bike headlights. This light has a great blinking feature, and would be good in well lit areas, but if you need it to light a dark path or road it's not bright enough, only 21 lumens. Do your research for the light you need."
3,"Great headlight, IF it fits your handlebar","I purchased this headlight for my older bicycle and it worked great. Great price for a good headlight. I had to dock this two stars though, because when I purchased a newer bike with beefier handlebars, this headlight no longer fit and I needed to replace it even though it was in perfect working order. More freedom of adjustment in the attachment loop would be much appreciated."
3,It works for it's intended purpose.,"It works to help others see you but what do much to help you see where you are going. It goes through batteries a little fast. And the mounting system seems simple, but the nut that the screw attaches to can fall out as can another piece that holds on to the screw. I figured that out after I dropped them both. Then it can be a little tougher than it seems it should be to screw it down to then clamp it on the bar.I like it enough that I'm not even considering replacing it. But I'd compare a few more models before buying another one."
3,Great light not so great mount,I love the light and the fact that it can easliy be removed. I also really like the idea of the mount. Unfortunatley the mount doesn't works so well. It fits great but the lever that keeps it tight will not stay closed. This means it won't stay tight. Fixed it with a rubber band. I'm going to keep it because I think the light is really well made.
3,First Bike Light,"I only started biking in my city about 6 months ago, and when the days started getting shorter, I knew I would need a front bike light. I looked around a little but wound up on Amazon and purchased this light. When it arrived, it was easy to install and very easy to figure out. I do wish the light was brighter, because some of the bike paths in DC are pitch black, but it would be an excellent light for someone who isn't dealing with a lot of trail riding."
3,Only adequate,"I have had this light for only a week, and it is adequate, but just only that. It does not provide enough light at even a resonable distance from the bike, say around 30 feet or so. At about that point, is becomes to diluted to be of any real value. It is probably better viewed as product that helps you be seen, rather than see the road, which is okay. It is, however, a good value for the money. With lights, as with all things, you tend to get what you pay for."
4,Good bargain. Decent light.,"Enough light for city streets and the flicker option really helps to make you visible, especially in city streets. The light is bright enough but if you want to drive in total darkness, you might want to go for something more powerful. Overall, I am satisfied with my buy."
2,"Good mount, barely enough light, even for this price range.","Bought this light after reading from all the positive reviews here. While the construction quality of the light and the mount is top-notch, the light output itself was really mediocre....actually it is not even mediocre. It's pathetic.You almost will have to be pitch black for the light to make any difference from what you are already seeing. And the beam is a spot-light sort of beam, so you can only see a little circle of pale brightness in front of you. Don't expect this light to light up anything that's more than 5 feet in front of you, it will not.Returning this for a Cateye light. It costs a little bit more, but does the job better. I think even the Bell Dawn Patrol light does a better job than this."
5,Efficient,"I go biking most of the time after work so i needed a light for my bike that could help me maneuver in the dark, when i came across this item i was at first reluctant to believe this thing will help me out but either way i gave it a try since i saw some photos showing it working how i was hoping it would, i was very suprised to confirm that the light worked exactly the way the picture showed the first time i drove my bike through dark areas, and since it has also a blincking mode it can be used to signal to the front of the bike. Plus the batteries last really long on this thing."
5,Awesome light can be seen from far distance,"Have ridden with this light for a few months now through rain and shine and it has worked great. It not only makes the area in front of you well lit, but can also be brightly be seen from a decently far distance."
4,Great Light For the Money,"I commute to work in the dark and this light provides enough visibility so I don't get surprised at 20mph. It's nowhere near an HID, but it only cost $20."
2,Not so great,"The light is decent at best. While I ride in an urban environment, there are some places that are almost entirely dark. This light simply isn't good enough.The worst thing is the bracket. It's a pain to put on and off, and on my bike at least, I could never get it to stay on correctly. Every bump I would go over, the thing would dislodge and point to the ground.For $20, I didn't expect much, but it's definitely not worth it unless you're on an extreme budget. My safety at night is far more valuable, so I will upgrade and spend a bit more."
3,Great product except...,"I purchased this product because of it's reviews (1st priority) and then it's price. While the product is a decent product (I only use it for the strobing light for safety reasons), I have noticed a flaw in it. As I ride my mountain bike on the streets where I live, I notice that after some vibration from the bumps in the road, the quick-latch lets go of its grip and the light falls onto my brake cables. I do not touch the light while out riding...so, I can only conclude that this loosening is due to vibration when I am riding. Not sure how to fix this."
2,Not bright enough,This light is not bright enough for biking in areas with no other or little illumination. I'm buying another light to bike after the sun goes down.
2,"Plenty of light, Too much interference.","The 3 LED Bike Beamer headlight provided plenty of light for my purpose, I used it at dawn or dusk. I don't ride when it is completely dark out so I don't know if this light would be sufficient for that. It is a little difficult to mount on a padded handle bar but not impossible. It does interfere with my wireless computer. It blocks signals and renders my riding computer useless. The mount is too small to mount on my fork, so I rarely use it any more."
3,"Overall, Not Bad","As the title says, overall this product is not bad. The light is sufficient for partially-lit, quiet city roads. Don't know that it would be bright enough for pitch black conditions. The other thing that holds it back is its bracket mount - it doesn't slide tight enough to keep the light from wobbling all over. Easily enough fixed by wrapping some masking tape around the handlebars under the mount. Its pluses are long battery life, it's easy to assemble, and it's easy to get the light off (so it doesn't get stolen). Considering the price, I'm happy."
3,Great Front Light.,"This is a really great, bright, light-weight light.My only qualm with it is the bracket is a bit finicky and sometimes needs to be messed with to be secure.A"
4,Great Bike light,"Can't go wrong with this light it's bright, batteries last a long time, and it's convenient to use. However, this light should only be used for short distances, in light traffic and doesn't have the necessary output to compete with car headlights at night. Bikes should not , IMHO, be rode at night. The Cam bracket is a little iffy and the bracket may not work on large bike bars. I have a Canondale bike. Great light for the price."
1,night only,"i bought a much brighter (800 lumens) yellow, flashing light for the front of my bike. This thing is OK for the night, but not OK for the daylight. I nearly was killed when a car door opened in front of me - hurt my shoulder pretty badly - because driver couldn't see me. Now that I have an 800 lumen yellow flashing light, they see me and I've avoided some collisions."
4,"Good price, bright light","Positives: Bright light, has multiple light settings (off, constant beam, flashing), the light portion is easily detachable so you can carry it with you (for theft prevention, or perhaps an emergency flashlight)Negatives: The attachment to the bike seems a bit loose (might just be the shape of my handle bars)."
5,Nice light,"Item came quickly. It has a very robust mount which is secure, flexible, and allows the light to be removed so no one steals it when you park. Light is very bright, and easy to turn on and off. In all, a nice product at a nice price."
3,"Five stars for the light, minus two for the stupid mount","The light itself has a quick release mechanism built into it. Why on earth does the mount also need one? This is the most poorly (over)designed mount for any bike accessory I've ever seen. I would return it just for that reason, but the light itself is so good, especially for the price. It's very bright and well focused."
5,Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mount,"Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mount. This is a great product, very bright and I like the way the first push of the button gives you the blinking mode since that attracts more attention on the road at night. I will buy again if needed.RB"
3,"Ok, but not as bright as it should be.","Needs more candlepower. It won't illuminate the bumps in the road at night. Also, batteries don't last long enough. I bought a cheap 'miner's lamp' type headset from Target for $7 and attached it to my helmet; it way outshines this thing."
5,It works fine,"The light was easy to install, and it works just like it's supposed to do. Great beams and a good flasher."
2,Planet Bike Beamer,"The light is nice and works as advertised HOWEVER I have found that it interferes with my bike computer causing it to act Crazy due to it being a wireless bike computer. Due to this problem with compatability with the wireless bike computer, I cannot recommend it......"
2,Would be nice if...,"it would stay on. It has good batteries,etc. I have to constantly smack it, twist it, thump it, etc. It won't stay on. Then when it is on, I'm not impressed. It's just not very bright."
5,Really Bright Light,Length:: 1:01 MinsThis bike light is pretty good. It's bright and it flashes. I like the flash because it catches peoples attention when your on the road.
1,doesn't handle getting wet,"the light worked well, I liked the clamp and the brightness and the batteries seemed to last forever. But the light can't handle getting wet. Mine got stuck in 'on' mode and wouldn't turn off. condensation was visible in the lens. I took the batteries out and when I put them back in it would only turn on some of the time and would turn off during a ride.not recommended."
3,"Decent, but...","this is a quality light that covers a decent area and is visible to cars. i use it in only an urban setting, so i can't comment on how it works in a really dark application. one serious flaw is that the mounting strap is really fat and will not close down on just any bike. i have an old fire mountain and this thing will NOT stay tight. any time i hit a bump, drop off a curb, etc, the light spins up off the road and right into my face. it's probably pretty funny looking to everyone sitting in traffic, but it's starting to get old. i even tried tampering with the hardware (it's just a #10 mech. screw), but haven't had any luck. i will update this review if i figure something out, but i doubt there's anything i can do."
3,OK for the price,"I agree with other reviews that it is rather odd that the light defaults to a blinking setting, requiring you to push the button twice for a regular, steady beam of light, but consider that to be a minimal problem. The real problem I have with this headlight is that I've never been able to get the mount to ""lock,"" so the headlight keeps slipping down. More often than not the light just ends up illuminating the patch of ground directly in front of me."
3,Lighting is OK but Mouting is not so good,The lighting is ok for letting other drivers to see you coming. Its not too great for lighting a wide area since the lighting is more concentrated in a circular area.The mounting bracket doesn't hold very tight. I have to adjust it after every ride because the rubber part doesn't create too much friction from keeping the light upright.
3,Powerful Light,The light is great. The clamp for the handle bars leaves something to be desired. It is difficult to adjuct and secure firmly so that the light won't bobble up and down. Whatever happened to metal clamps with a bolt which was far esier to tighten?
2,"Poorly designed, cheaply made","If you simply must buy the cheapest one, this light could be right for you. But if you ride at night often, or intend to keep the light longer than a year, I suggest you find a different product.I've owned brighter lights, and the thing is really cheaply made. Prior to use I often need to twist the cap on/off a few times before the electrical contacts find each other again. Sometimes it'll turn off by itself, even on fresh batteries. I think the jostling of the pavement causes this. The plastic is cheap and brittle, and I'm waiting (hoping) for it to finally break so I can buy a different one."
2,Started good. Then became a nuisance.,"This bike light was cheap yet effective for a couple years. A few weeks ago, the on/off switch stopped working and the bike light always remained on. Now it doesn't work at all. I'm guessing that the malfunctioning is due to rain or moisture.Also, the bracket is poorly designed and the bike light rattles while I ride."
3,Disappointing,"I purchased the light because it seemed to be well made, but was disappointed with the Quick Cam Bracket mount, plus the front section that is removable for replacing batteries came off 1 day while I was riding on a quite smooth bike trail and the batteries fell out. Also, I ride a three wheel recumbant trike which rides harder than a conventional bicycle and I cannot get the quick cam mount to hold securely, every few miles I have to reaim the headlight because it starts to tilt down at the front. I have tightened the cam until I was afraid of breaking the mount when I locked in position, not to mention I prefer a more secure mount so I can leave it on the bike, not to mention the extreme effort required to lock it back on. If I leave it on the bike it is far too easy to remove for the purpose of vandalism or theft.Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mount"
3,Not bright enough for riding on streets,"This is a great little light if you plan to use it in very dark trails. But if you plan to ride your bike in the streets at night with little street lights, this Beamer light won't be sufficient. In streets that there is little light, it will not provide much more. in fact the lights that it produces, get lost in existing little lights of the streets, but absolutely good lighting for very dark areas."
1,Junk bracket,Overall a piece of crap due the bracket that is all but worthless. I'd gve it less than one star if I could. Don't waste your money on this unless your looking for a flashlight.
2,"a SMALL, blinding spot :(","I am truly surprised at the great reviews for this light; It's just another small spot of light on the road, two or three feet in front of the bike, which makes it totally useless as any kind of headlight either in city streets with lighting, or in pitch-dark (unless you want to scan the spot in front of your wheel for potholes while you ride).update: I found a Cateye EL220 for $27 that blew this out of the water :)"
3,Ok for the price.,"Not as bright as I would have expected but also not as expensive as the other ones on the market. Keep it out of rain. Bear in mind that you will only get 2 AA batteries' worth of power, so don't expect super bright light. I actually have two installed on my handlebar - bright enough for me."
3,Not-to-bright light,"Found the light functional and descent, but not bright enough for trail riding. I would suggest it for short trips, but not on trails after dark."
3,"Good light, but be careful. Not for rough riding!","The brightness is decent (especially in real darkness, with no light poles around), and I like how small and unobtrusive the main unit is. Unfortunately, it's also quite fragile, and won't survive a fall, especially during a fast ride on city streets. The mount is really iffy and a slight bump on the ""switch"" (which is the same kind as on wheel skewers) will unlock it completely. Plus, the screw that tightens it to the handlebars isn't in a circular plastic piece, it's in a piece that's open on one end. It's basically designed to pop out and drop the whole thing. What were they thinking? Even without that problem, the thing slowly dips down when I ride.EDIT: If you have a thin piece of rubber (like from another mount), use it to make the connection to the handlebars tighter. I did this and it helps a lot."
1,Dissapointing Bike light,"I purchased this light thinking it was a great buy, but when I got it I was dissapointed with everything about it. The mounting quick release would not stay locked in place when tightened enough to keep light in place. The brightness or lack of brightness was dissapointing as well. I cannot see anyone making use of this light unless you ride at dawn or dusk and want others to see you. It will not shine bright enought to show you the way when it's dark."
3,fragile and dim,"my preschool son popped this off the handle bar mount and it fell to our hardwood floors. The casing broke near the on/off switch and now it will not reliable stay on. Also, disappointed in the brightness -- own many other LED lights (headlamp, flashlights) and this light is relatively dim"
4,Very good! Almost perfect.,"Great Light!The mounting bracket gives me a little bit of trouble - gets loose and requires periodic adjustments. I think I will end up putting a couple of drops of GORILLA GLUE to secure it once and for all.But the light itself is TERRIFIC!!! In New York, I do not need to illuminate the road (street lamps are everywhere). My goal is to be seen. I put it in blinking mode, and motorists can DEFINITELY see me now - from afar!In a few months, I must have had about 20 random people on the street asking me where I got this.It's one of my best purchases lately."
4,Excellent for commuting,"I bike 4 miles (one-way) to a suburban train station daily. My last head light was lifted off my bike. So I was looking for a replacement that is easy to remove and install. With Beamer 3, I can do it in a couple of seconds. On the street, I use the flashing mode and car-drivers can see me well (they yield). On the bike trail, where there is no other light source, I have to switch to constant mode and dip the angle of the light to see better. If you are in unfamiliar territories, the light may not be enough (or you have to go slower). But it is definitely good for commuting purpose. I use rechargeable batteries for my Beamer 3. After 4 weeks' use (it was dark both ways most of the days), I still do not need to recharge them. The Beamer 3 serves my needs well. Now that the price has dropped further since I got them (I bought two), I highly recommend the Bearmer 3 for commuters."
4,"Super bright light, but problems installing it","I would've given this five stars, but for some reason I had a hard time with the installation. I couldn't get the mount to fit tight enough on my handlebar and when I hit a bump the light almost fell off!I fiddled with it a bit and finally got it on and am really happy with it now. It could be something wrong with me..."
2,The light works great until it has suffered water damage,"The only problem with this device is that it's not waterproof. I ended up buying a better light after about 1 year of usage and perhaps 5 or 6 rainy rides. This won't matter for those of you who avoid riding the bike in the rain at all costs, but for those of us who do this it's a matter of great concern.Water doesn't only get into the battery compartment, but oddly also into the front part where the LED's are. It's close to impossible to clean this area from the oxidation build up resulting from water.Another issue with this light is that the light going sideways could be stronger, so cars approaching you from the sides can spot you more easily.The bottom line is, the price is good and the lamp works well in general, but I feel obligated to tell you about the water problem since all the reviews seem to be missing this major flaw.If you still want to buy this, I recommend using tape to isolate it a little better."
2,not very long lasting...,"this is an ok light for the price. DO NOT get it wet. mine has been malfunctioning ever since I rode w it in the rain. it will turn on and off at random times, like when I'm not using the bike etc. I've never submerged this light, just exposed it to some rains while commuting. I'd buy a better light and spend some more cash for better safety, durability and longevity. there are much better lights available on amazon or at your local bike shop."
3,"Light good, Button/Mount not so much.","As the title light, the light itself works fine. I can see pretty far at night, and the two options are pretty nice.However, the button is pretty hard to push, as it is sunken in. I cannot just use one finger, like the way you turn on your computer or punch in a phone number- I have to wrap my hand around it and steady it and then use my thumb to push it. Naturally, on a bike, you want to be able to push the button quickly, so a protruding button would have been a much better design.In addition, the mount is made of pure hard plastic, so even though it does fit tight to the handlebars, regardless of diameter, it frequently slips around the axis of the handbar. A little rubber for better grip is definitely required."
2,Light not bright enough,The light was not bright enough to illuminate. If it is too dark to ride without any lights it is too dark to ride with this one - it made almost no difference. I tried different sets of batteries. I then arranged a refund. This was no hassle at all. I bought the 2watt light from the same company to replace it.
5,Great Light,"Bought this on sale and it seems to be a very good light,It will be enough for those late day early evening riders and riding on cloudy days so you can be seen better.Not really a true ""Night"" riding light in pitch dark IMO but thats not why I bought it.Seems well made and is supposed to have a lifetime warranty whatever that means.So all in all would buy another."
2,Disappointing,"I really liked this little light and used it everyday for 2 months. Unfortunately it's easy to install bracket, like other one and two star reviews have mentioned, degrades with time. This is understandable, but two months?? I used one of those rubber strips to hold the bracket in place, and with time even with the rubber piece the bracket would not clamp closed and stay closed. I'm disappointed that it didn't even last one riding season. Once the bracket goes there's no such thing as buying a spare, except I guess from ebay...."
3,you will be seen,"you won't get much light out of this, but if you want people to notice you, get this light. would love to have a dionette but it's not within the budget."
4,"Easy, Bright great.",This LED is real easy to put on your handle bars. The on button is placed right on top and is easy to press while riding. It provides great illumination. Definitely a decent bike light for the price.
4,Very bright,"The beam is very bright. Wish the default setting was steady light vs blinking, but not that big a deal. Handle-bar connection was a bit more work than I thought it needed to be; not easy to attach/remove all the time. Better to attach and then leave it on."
4,Nice bright light,"Works fine, much brighter than the conventional light with a tungsten filament bulb that it replaced. Slight indents on each side of the light allows the light to be seen from the side - a nice safety feature. I do recommend it and only give 4 stars because the mounting mechanism was not as good as it should be. I had to use some parts of the light I replaced to get a good tight fit on my handlebars."
3,"Awesome Light, Atrocious Mounting Bracket","The light itself deserves 5-stars and the mounting bracket barely earns 1-star. I've owned this light for about a year, and the mount has been nothing but trouble. A few weeks ago, the plastic piece that tightens the bracket around the handlebars broke completely. Now when I'm on a bumpy street or going down a hill, the light rattles loose. Very annoying."
4,"good price, well designed","This light can't be beat for the bargain it is, but if you are looking for more visibilty, so as not to get hit by someone like an A.D.D. driver texting a message far more important than your human life, you might want to look into another light or mount two of these. I mounted two, (they are really narrow, two fit just fine and you can flash one and burn the other steady). They use 2 AA batteries and have a long run time, also the lights detach right off the quick mounts and are pocket size."
4,ok,it works fine. bright. only problem is it's too big for my handle bar so it slides around but i put some plastic between it and the bar and that solved things.
5,Great product for the price,"I bought two of these and used them once so far. They fulfill the purpose, makes the biker visible from a distance. In addition, I've detached and used them as lights when tent-camping and found them very useful. There batteries seem to last a long time and I am using regular alkalines."
5,Small but powerful.,"This light is all you'll really need if you want to be seen. In the flash mode, it gets drivers attention well before they are anywhere near you. No need to spend more money. This light will do the job."
5,Worth the price!,"I bought this after looking at many other products. One advantage with LED powered lights in this product is that, battery life is significantly longer than a same rating filament bulb. You can buy a filament bulb bicycle light little cheaper than this but this product saves battery life. So the price and the power saving was my main reasons to buy this product."
1,Hope you have alot of time to spare,I found this product to be full of bugs and workarounds. In my mind any product that you have to pay for support you should be weary of. I also can't understand why we the end users are forced to make edits to our regisrty to get their product to work. Just my .02

5,Take the worry out of feeding your baby,"As a new grandma, I just love this book(If only it had been around when I was wrestling with my own kids!) I'm sending it to my daughter right away. Her's a reality check on how normal kids learn to eat. It's a fun, relaxed, and practical guide to conquering the anxieties that make feeding a baby such a hassle. Very soothing. If you want to know ""Why?"", there's solid science dished out in tasty little bites that new parents can enjoy. But the bulk of the advice is simple, hands-on information about getting from breast to full-fledged meals from a nutrition pro who must have kids of her own."
5,Great info!,"This book is a great resource. It has a section for each age group so that you know what your baby needs as he grows, and when to add new types of foods. It also has many great recipes that are simple and your baby will love!"
1,Wholesomebabyfood dot com is way better and free,"You will find easier to access, free, more complete information at wholesomebabyfood. Com. I can't imagine why you would need a book to tell you to microwave veggies. Wholesomebabyfood has charts and recipes everything organized by age and cross-referenced by food. Along with info on gently helping your toddler try new things. Check it out, way better and free."
2,Disappointing,"This book is truly designed for those who have never read anything about feeding their baby or toddler. I did not really find any of the information new or very useful. Some of the recipes look simple enough to try, but I was disappointed that they do not include basic nutritional information. I would also have preferred to see mention of portion sizes, as well as healthy non-perishable snack ideas for toting in the diaper bag (my toddler is not yet ready for raw veggies).But if you are looking for just the very basics and don't really need details or a lot of information, this might be for you. I personally find the information I get in some of my magazine subscriptions more useful."
2,Not great,Has all the Basic info. Probably good for the average reader. However I have a picky 11 month old and this book just doesn't do. The conventional Recipes are great for good eaters!
5,The soundtrack to my life circa 1987/1988,"I was living in South Yarra in Melbourne in the late 1980s and I bought both the CD and MC of this album and it was constantly on my walkman. ""O Patti"" was and still is a classic track. The rest of the album is very good. Sure, it wasn't quite as good as ""Cupid & Psyche"", but it was pretty darn good anyway and it was head and shoulders above anything else that was released around that time.Miles Davis plays on this album and the general sound is full and luxurious - full marks to producer, Arif Mardin.Many people don't ""get"" Scritti Politti and never will. However, for those who do, the rewards are great. Nice to see that Green Gartside is still making excellent music under the name of Scritti Politti.Warning to 80s nostalgia buffs - this album probably will disappoint you - it sounds like it was recorded yesterday."
4,Very Underrated!,"The sound quality is superb, the sentiments expressed have a coquettish calculated quality, the boys run rings around the studio. If you liked Cupid and Psyche, how can you not like this album? It's darker, but I disagree about over production problems. That's not a problem here."
4,Miles Davis is on this CD,"This is an amazing pop CD. The great Miles Davis played on this CD, together with Marcus Miller. I guess they were returning a favour when Miles Davis covered Scritti's ""Perfect Way""."
5,Leave off half the tracks and you still have a 5-star album,"Look... Half the tracks here I don't wanna hear. A couple tracks besides that are O.K. But the remaining tracks are glimpses from the absolute tippy-top of the musical mountain. 'Boom! There She Was', 'Bam Salute', 'Sugar & Spice', 'Philosophy Now' -- these are some real nuggets. If you don't like keyboards one bit, go put on a bib and listen to Black Sabbath. The music contained here is the real heavy sound. Cascading chords each played on different keyboards, bass drums and snares capable of crushing skulls -- that's what's up. Blast this in the car and drive into what is still the future of music."
4,Practical help for occasional cooks.,"This book is very helpful for occasional cooks. It carefully lists the ingredients, so you can be ready to prepare the item. It gives detailed instructions without assuming that the reader already knows the terminology. Although I have used only a few of the recipes, those I did use turned out very well. My confidence in the book's recipes comes also from the sources of the recipes: popular acclaim from those who have used them (from the backs of boxes, etc.). I do not know whether all of the name-brand products are still available, but assume that either they are or that one can readily find equivalents."
4,Time Honored Traditions,"This book stands on its own as superb. Yet more and more it has become, in our family, a invaluable resource for tracking down those long-lost, but not forgotten, recipes of yesteryear. Whenever my mom is looking for an old favorite, chances are we'll find it in here. THAT is the real value of this book, at least to me. :)"
4,Gourmet Made Easy,"Ceil Dyer's ""Best Recipes"" brings culinary wonders to the comfort of one's home. Most of the recipes are easy and delicious. There are a few clunkers, such as the Reuben croquettes (corned beef/sauerkraut dumplings with a lemony dipping sauce),but most are easy to make with wonderful results.Apple Kraut Bavarian is a delicious blend of sausages, sauerkraut,and applesauce (it was great using applesauce from Sebastopol) The wheat germ vegetarian torte is simple and hearty. Macaroni&Beans; Italiano is a great way of enjoying Italian food on a budget. Seven Seas Casserole is a great combination of tuna, rice, and cream of mushroom soup.""Best Recipes"" makes good cooking simple. It's an essential for any kitchen library!"
4,Recipes to treasure,"Recipes that you remember as a child are here. Lots of convenience foods are used as well, making dinnertime a little easy on anyone in need of more time in the day. Also an interesting read, some recipes are really ingenius and fun!"
2,Old recipes,"There are other versions of this book that might be better. This has no pictures and the recipes are all quite old. Some of the ingredients are not even available for purchase anymore. Many of the recipes are dated, some going back to early 1900's. Overall, the entire book contained maybe 5 recipes that I am willing to try. If you are looking to purchase this book, you might want to try purchasing Ceil Dyer's latest version of it in hopes of finding some newer recipes!"
4,Stuff Works,"I've been using xplc for a little more than a year now and it still gives me the added boost of energy I use it for. I won't say it's a miracle pill for fat loss, but it is good at curbing your appetite."
4,Good stuff...,I'm about 3 weeks into taking a Stacker with breakfast each morning and the boost is great. I'm not taking it as a fat-burner twice a day so I can't speak to those claims. My wife has a low tolerance for products like this and even she's taking it regularly with no jitters or discomfort.
3,Not as effective,Like most fat burners my body adjusts to them after a few weeks. This one is no different. The best I can use it for is an energy boost if I take it 15 minutes or so before hitting the gym.
2,Wrong image,I really like the product but I can get the pills here in town. I sent for them on line because of the package. I like the seperate tubes that the pills come in. The pills they sent were in a bottle. This was a waste of time.
1,wrong OME,"I gave them all the right info , still sent the wrong OME filter. The factory one was way better then this cheep one!Save your money and buy it from a dealer."
4,OEM quality,"Should be OEM with what cam in the car. I will change it come spring, and see how much dirt it grabbed over the winter."
1,?,Where is it? Have not received the two books as of this date 6/21/12 I have been waiting a very long time for something I really want.
2,Not what was pictured,"Only received one book of the set. Shows dust covers on books, there wasn't a dust cover on the one book I received. The company was really good & very prompt about issuing a full refund, including shipping, when I contacted them :)"
2,What happened to my order....,"I understood I was ordering Volume One & Two (as the advertisement suggest); however, I only received Volume Two... It has been almost 2 months & I have still not received Volume One!!!"
1,Revitalizing mist,"This product is like spraying water on yourself, it has no scentand is a poor representation for a musk mist."
2,cooker is to be natural gas,I bought this cooker from amazon because i love the convenience of shopping here. So when our son picked this as a gift i went to amazon rather than where he found it. Numbers matched exactly. When it came it was in a busted up box the parts were out of their box and there was no natural gas connection or parts. Highly disappointed.
2,Picture doesn't match the product,"This is the second Brinkman cooker I've purchased. The first one looks just like the picture, this one doesn't. The pan and basket on the first one were much better and that's the main reason I liked it. In the picture you see a stainless wire basket, but what you really get is an alluminum basket with holes in it. Disappointing. It was my fault because the description doesn't match the picture. Another lesson learned."
4,A happy suprise!,"I thought, judging by the title, that this movie was going to be lame. But, I am a sucker for vampire movies (no pun intended) so I watched it and was pleasantly suprised by the quality. The satire of the infamous ""12 step program"" is an absolute riot. ""Apologize to those you've maimed, killed, or debaucherized."" HA! Anyone who enjoys a humorous story with a few major quirks should really check this one out. Michael Madsen is great as a vampire trying to kick his human blood addiction by preying on local livestock instead. Several sheep jokes later (""Beware of the sheep shagger"") he falls in love with a local girl. But when he ""falls off the wagon"" a professional vamp slayer comes looking for him. Good stuff!"
5,Pretty Damn Good :),"I have a soft spot for Jacques Cousteau. These documentaries are definitely worth while, though there's 2 things I don't understand:1. Why are they mostly around Australia when the collection is called Pacific Adventures? (If Jacques Cousteau were playing Risk, he wouldn't have a very good strategy. haha)2. Why is this DVD like $20 cheaper than the other two collections? They're all equally good."
3,"Lost 60""s Gem Poorly Remastered","The first H.P. Lovecraft album is one of the great unrecognized recordings of the era. It has almost as much imagination and variety as ""Rubber Soul"" or ""Revolver"". It was well recorded and well performed. Unfortunately the remastering from REVOLA does not do it justice. It is muddy and unbalanced. The high end is shrill and some parts almost disapear. H.P. LovecraftII is not as strong."
2,Beverly falls in love?,"Dr. Crusher falls in love with an alien diplomat, who is involved in peace talks with an alien planet. But the good Doctor is crushed when she learns that her lover is actually a parasitic life form that lives off host bodies and has lived for years. The episode becomes even worse when the symbiont is planted into Riker's body to resume the peace talks, and when a suitable host comes aboard the Enterprise, the symbiont is finally placed in the body of a woman."
3,Start half way through and it's good,"Man, looking at the reviews people really didn't like this one.Well the first half IS awful. Once Eddie & Owen arrive in Budapest though, things start to improve. Better yet, start the movie where Eddie and Owen are in the sewer, this and the very next sequence with Famke are the best scenes in the film. The action scenes (done by the second unit director) also look so much better than most of the scenes done by director Betty Thomas. Really, the only redeeming factors in this film are the actors, who when they are allowed to interact with oneanother are a lot of fun to watch.The DVD: Nothing great here. The featurettes are boring. And the commentary is surely one of the worst I've ever heard. I hate it when 5 people talk at the same time and none of them can remember any details (like people's names).Rent this DVD and watch it and enjoy it for the scenes with Owen and Eddie, but skip the rest."
3,nothing like the TV show but a great duo:Wilson and Murphy,"sometimes dumb and annoying and other times a lot of fun and great. Wilson and Murphy are great as always and its better than Murphy's Pluto Nash stinkbomb he did that year as well. some funny moments include Wilson trying to love up the sexy Famke Janssen and where Murphy spills out his emotions int he sewer, just upraorous. and Gary Cole is great and that mexican guy"
1,Eddie needs to really think about retiring,Eddie Murphy has reached his prime and this movie just lets you know that it is time for him to hang up his comedy torch and enjoy the rich life minus movie making. The comedy is weak and the plot is weaker. I am just glad that I didn't pay to see this in the movies. Don't waste your money or time buying this because it isn't worth it.
1,Ugh: insipid and tired,"It's not even really a re-vamp of the old TV series, which was intelligent, dramatic and high-minded, whereas this pile of beetle dung is insipid, silly beyond imagination for something with this budget and low-brow. Eddie phones in a wack performance that no one buys anyway, and Owen Wilson should have his nose broken straight for opting to appear in this tripe. Not funny, not necessary and not even rent-worthy. If ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" is actually worse than this, someone needs to tie Eddie Murphy to a chair and make him watch ""Raw"" over and over until his eyes bleed. It's utterly anti-climactic and the ""riffing"" between Murphy and Wilson is not only over-rated, but tired."
3,It was fun,"I sat down with absolutely no expectations of this movie. It was far fetched and outlandish, but I took it with a grain of salt. The way it was meant to be taken. For parents: there were a few sexual references and a lot of violence (it is a spy movie). Do not get this movie if you are looking for a serious spy movie, only if you want a fun movie with a few on liners and some slapstick chase scenes. There are better movies out there, but there are alot worse as well."
1,"""I Spy"" in Name Only","Once again, a classic TV series receives shoddy Hollywood treatment. ""I Spy"" (2002) takes the show's name and trashes everything that made it memorable. Failing to click as a team, Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson never display the smooth rapport associated with Bill Cosby and Robert Culp. Meanwhile, director Betty Thomas struggles through depressingly routine material. Avoid this fiasco and track down the 1965-68 episodes (which the screenwriters never bothered to see)."
2,I Spy A Letdown,"Kelly Robinson (Murphy) is the super middle weight champion who is enlisted by a phone call from George Dubya to help Alexander Scott (Wilson) recover the a stealth fighter stolen by Gundars (Malcolm McDowell).The movie itself had a few funny moments but that's about it. Eddie Murphy was so annoying in this movie that I was tempted to turn it off. To his credit, the ""Sexual Healing"" bit was pretty funny but that was about it. The story line was long and drawn out and there was absolutely no originality in this remake."
2,so so,this film was not as good as i had expected. there are some funny scenes but the film seems to lack something
2,Low budget and low humor James Bond knockoff..,"I was really disappointed in this film. I know the ""spy theme"" has been done a hundred times, but this film didn't have one new sequence or gadget or anything. The plot is so cliche' it was offensive. The action sequences were substandard and the acting, sorry to say, was amateur.My advice - rent this only if every other store in the movie is gone or if you have a free rental coupon that expires tomorrow."
4,Very Entertaining,"I wasn't sure I would like this movie but went with friends. I was delightfully surprised by what I saw. It took a while for the movie to get started but when it did we laughed a lot. I haven't seen Eddie Murphy in a good movie in so long. He is very talented, it was nice to see him use that talent. Owen Wilson is who he is and he's very good at it. He's the charming goof ball who gets the job done. We had a fun night at the movies, you will, too."
2,No reason to own this,"This movie is barely a comedy, it is really two people playing roles, and only marginal at best. On one hand you have the brash, egocentric boxer, and on the other hand you have the bumbling, inept James Bond wannabe. Both characters are so steretypical there is absolutely no humor to be found. The story is boring and trite, and the only thing I found myself watching was the DVD counter to see how it would be before I was put out of my misery. There is NO chemistry between Wilson and Murphy, and I feel they are both great comic actors in other movies.Don't do it to yourself! Watch the TV series!!"
5,Greatest Eddie Murphy Movie EVER,"By looking at this movie you would say i wouldn't waste my time.But this movie is top notch. A great storyline, great acting by Murphy and Wilson, and funny like you wouldn't believe. Definetely buy this movie."
4,Good and clear,"I like this book as it is clearly written with good examples. If you are thinking about counseling a person, it will be an interesting reference."
3,Non-hypnotic patterns of Milton,"Milton doesn't put people into a trance all the time, many times he just uses it ability to establish rapport and asks the client to do something. Not much about trance, but covers the non-hypnotic part of Erickson."
5,Excellent item for the working a photographer...,Great lots of room for a whole digital kit 10-20mm 24-70 f2.8 70-200 f2.8 two pro dslr's 4 speedlight's and room for more
4,Good Transaction,"While I would rate the book in ""good"" condition, the listing said ""very good"". It had a large water stain and wrinkled pages from the water, which would lower it to ""good"" in my eyes. However, I know this book has been very hard to find, so I'm very happy to have gotten it. The transaction was perfect and shipping was very quick."
5,Great Series,"I read this series in third grade and I can still sit down and read it over and over. The six books are one of my treasured series that I will never get rid of, and it fueled many stories of my own!"
2,Poor Effort,"While this greatest hits collection will satisfy distant fans of DS (all the songs are excellent), it will disappoint others more familiar with the band. Its pretty much the type of CD you expect to be marketed on late night TV - just the immediately recognizable ""hits"" with later tracks thrown in. From the early period, where is Wild West End, Down to the Waterline, even Six Blade Knife, Comminque, Once Upon a Time in the West, Where Do You Think You're Going, or maybe Follow Me Home. From the mid period, leaving out Skateaway is unforgiveable. Later period is covered well (but given the paucity of earlier material of greater substance how did the producers then cull three cuts from the On Every Street album?). Since there isn't much alternative for DS fans, it probably warrants purchase. It is so insulting in content though, hold out until better offerings come along - if you can wait that long."
3,"good, but buy the first album instead for a better introduction","This is a good collection of the bands biggest hits, but I simply LOVE the mellow, moody atmosphere and guitar playing on the very first Dire Straits album. I recommend you buy THAT album before this one. You'll thank me, I guarantee it!! Talk about an album you'll want to play on a hot summer night! I truly believe if you like the song ""Sultans of Swing"" you will love the rest of the songs on the debut. The rest of the album maintains the same kind of vibe. The high quality of the songwriting mixed with a great rhythm section is another highlight. Just... awesome! Skip this Very Best Of collection."
2,EDITED!!!,"I realize that they had to edit this CD in order to put all the tracks on it...that's clear. My advice to all of you is to do what I did. Download all of the full versions of every song on the album minus ""Private Investigations"" and ""Local Hero/Wild Theme"". Leave those 2 songs off and you will have enough room on your blank CD to put the rest on it. The reason for eliminating these 2 tracks is....1. ""Private Investigations"" has no beat or rythym to it at all and is a boring song...and 2. ""Local Hero/Wild Theme"" is a cover of a solo working by Knopfler, so why is it even on here. Go buy the album ""Screenplaying"" if you want to hear that song. Do this and you will have a perfect Dire Straits ""Best Of"" CD."
5,Sultans of swing: the very best of Dire Steaits,"Excellent Dvd. My Husband has been looking all over for this piece, and Amazon had it at an excellent price. Thank You."
3,Not down with the editing,"As with _Money for Nothing_, the previous compilation, editing these mostly-terrific songs down did allow them to fit in more tracks -- but sometimes it needs to be more about the quality than the quantity. I must also disagree with the Amazon editorial review which suggests that this disc plus _Making Movies_ equals ""the essential Dire Straits."" ""The essential Dire Straits"" simply can't exist in the absence of ""Telegraph Road."""
4,Sultans of Swing,"""Sultans of Swing"" is one of my favorite songs ever. Other than that, though, I couldn't realy get that much into Dire Straits. This song, however, is a must have in any collection of rock."
2,Buy The Other Albums Insted,"This compilation has 1 song you never found on the other albums, Twisting By The Pool. And I like it great. But several songs on this is in EDITED VERSIONS! Buy all their studio albums and stop wasting time getting into Dire Straits with this. Get into them by buying all their studio albums. They are all full length. Plusthis is missing too many good songs. Where are they. Not a greatest hits album at all, plus Dire Straits are one of the greatest rock groups in history. I got into Dire Straits by buying this, then I bought On Every Street and it was more fulllength. Then I bought the others and they were better.Don't buy this. Get Them insted."
2,Edited and ruined,"Dire Straits / Sultans of swing / the very best of Dire Straits: I hate to agree with the complainers, but this time they are right. The editing out of the `faggots' line from Money For Nothing is unacceptable and the fact that the consumer is not made aware of that edit in inexcusable. Two Stars for ruining the enjoyment of this album."
4,A GREAT DIRE STRAITS COMPILATION.,"This is a pretty darn good album from Dire Straits but most people complain because 'Money for Nothing' is edited! Well I don't mind. A compilation that has 'Heavy Fuel' is the best toget if you are new to Dire Straits. It is missing a couple songslike 'Telegraph Road', and 'Expresso Love'. It would have been complete if those songs were included. I like all 14 songs on this album but they seem better on the other albums, just becausethey're not edited. Especially Sultans of Swing rocks! My favorite tracks are the beginning, 'Tunnel of Love', 'Lady Writer', 'Money for Nothing', and 'Heavy Fuel'. 'Private Investigations' is probably the weakest track on the album as well. I will recommend this album to anyone who dosen't have itbecause it is quite good, especially for beginners, go get thisgreat greatest hits album with Making Movies, and Love Over Goldtoday from this great band. Dire Straits will always be a great band."
1,Warning! Edited Version!,"I was pleased with this collection, until I realized that the entire second verse of ""Money For Nothing"" had been edited out. I assume that this was done so as not to offend sensitive ears with a derogatory term for male homosexuals, which was used as a shorthand device to make no doubt of the ignorance of the song's narrator. And Knopfler has always maintained that the song came from an actual conversation that he overheard. Too bad that irony is lost on the do-gooders, and that they have taken a song that makes a blistering point and have removed much of its power. A complete disgrace. Politically correct morons, 1, Rock and Roll, 0. I sure hope these people never listen to ""Rednecks"" by Randy Newman."
4,Good limited edtion.,"Dire Straits have made great music. So many even that you can't put them on 1 CD! But here's the best of CD, and what they did was putting all the short versions of their very best songs on 1 CD. Well that's one way to get a best of CD. But I think the versions are too short for the real Dire Straits fans. They are used to long instrumental sections. That's what i'm missing! Fortunately they have a limited edition. On the second CD you get a live-concert from the band. Good long versions!So my advise is: Buy the limited 2CD version or don't buy it at all!"
5,One VERY cool CD.....,this CD is awesome - all of the best of Dire Straits - and then when you get sick of that - you can put on the live CD for a bit of a change
4,Great selection of songs- but...,"Although the selection of songs is great, I felt that Dire Straits has better versions already on other CD's. The Sultans of Swing is probably one of the best live songs anywhere, and Romeo and Juliet has grown in depth over the years. Both of these songs on this CD are the studio versions and I would have preferred the 'live' versions instead. Still, this CD is very good and worth a look!"
3,"It's 1999, time for another best of....","This is the second very best of Dire Straits CD that has been released, and, although as ever the music is excellent, the slightly different mix of tracks and the addition of a few songs from ""On every street"" don't seem to justify the price of another album, or the extra room it takes up in your collection. Now if Mark had written some new stuff (or even just recorded some altered versions of older stuff a'la Bruce Springsteen) you wouldn't hear me complaining and I would have happily given this five stars. As it is, nice try but needs a little more effort."
5,Dire Straits,"Well recorded CD. If your a fan of Dire Straits I would highly recomend this CD, you won't regreat it."
4,WARNING: YOU'LL WANT THE ORIGNAL ALBUMS!!!,"While there is certainly a great hour to be had here, I can think of at least 12 more songs you would want to hear without getting one bit dilutive. So while this is indeed a great bargain, I suggest you pass it up and go for all six original albums instead."
2,Very Best? Not Quite.,"How can the ""Very Best of"" CD not conatin the Very Best Song...Skateaway from 1980's Making Movies LP. Long forgotten song that deserves way better treatment than it has received through the years."
1,Bad Editing...save your $$$,"This would have been a good cd except for the edited version of Money for Nothing which removed the most memorable line in any Dire Straits song - ""The Little F@got wioth the earings and the makeup....."" I guess they got politically correct in their old age. In addition there is some very boring live recordings where the band sounds asleep. Not worth it!!!"
4,Mark Knopfler & Dire Straits,"I had some difficulty deciding my favorite MK/Dire Straits album, and chose this one. My choices were the early pop driven(but excellent) 'Brothers In Arms"", and the more recent 'Sailing to Philadelphia.' I chose this because it represents a broad cross section of their work. Four of my favorite songs are missing: ""Wild West End"", ""Down to the Waterline"", ""Telegraph Road"", and ""What It Is-Aubrey Haynie."" Knopfler demonstrates why he is one of the very best guitarists and song writers of rock and roll."
4,Fantastic CD mastering!,"""~Enough has been said about the content of this excelent compilation! I will judge the CD mastering: noticeable (due to the re-mastering itself). If you like Dire Straits, by all means get this one!"
4,"Almost perfect, but...","Good coverage of the hits and good sound quality, but two quibbles keep it from a 5-rating:1. I'd choose slightly different selections (Skateaway and Industrial Disease in particular are missed).2. Be aware that several songs are edited from the original; especially Money For Nothing which had almost half its length (intro, one verse, trailer) chopped!I would have preferred the previous compilation (Money For Nothing) with this compilation's sound quality. Oh well,it's still a good collection, just be aware of the edits, which caught me by surprise."
4,Very nice import set,This is a really nice import set. I have to admit that I really like the concept of it: 1 CD of Best Of material and a DVD with the videos of the same songs. I'd honestly forgotten how fun some of thier videos from the earlier MTV days really were.The 2nd CD of live material is very nice. Good sound quality with very energetic versions of the songs. The opening track of Calling Elvis is a really nice version. A 12+ minute Sultans Of Swing - how can you go wrong?Definately worth the price in my book as a nice audio and video compilation.Just remember it is a PAL dvd! You will need an all-region DVD player or most computer DVD drives should be able to handle it.
5,Incredible,"A great collection of songs, and some of the best audio quality I've ever heard from a standard CD. Turn this one up on a high-end system and enjoy the crisp clean sound."
4,Good times and Great Music,This was a bit of an impulse purchase for me and I'm more than happy with it. Dire Straights has many wonderful songs (some which I hadn't even connected with the band) and this CD is on heavy rotation in my car. A classic rock Classic!
1,one great song and a whole album of rubbish,dire straits the most over-rated puke making band this world has ever produced god this bands suck..my mom loves this band i hate them with a passion..i really really hate them that's my opipion give me negative i don't care..my opipion is all i care for..and this suxsif you like your music with alot of corn buy thisbut if you like your music with a bit of meatbuy greenday greatest hitsGNR appetite for destructionnick drake pink moonmark lanegan bubblegumt.rex electric warriorblack sabbath paronoiddon't swallow this cheesy corn..the only good song ismoney for nothing..
5,Missing Too Many Songs!!,"This maybe my favorite compilation out by any band!! But theresonly 2 reasons why you shoudn't buy this CD, it's got editing,and it is missing too many songs. Down To The Waterline (My favorite), Six Blade Knife, Lions, Where Do You Think You're Going, Skateaway, Expresso Love, Hand in Hand, Solid Rock, LesBoys, Telegraph Road, Industrial Disease, Love over Gold studio,It Never Rains, Your Latest Trick studio, Why Worry, Ride Acrossthe River, The Mans Too Strong, One World, When It Comes To You,Fade to Black, The Bug, You and Your Friend, My Parties, & Planet of New Orleans are all missing. But it's got most of myfavorites. My favorites would be Tunnel of Love, Private Investigations, So Far Away, Money for Nothing, & Heavy Fuel.Buy the whole CD, it's got some really good songs on it and Ilike every song on it!"
2,A compilation of cut versions,"I am a Dire Straits fan. This is why I am disappointed that this compilation provides cut versions of many tracks. Two minutes of Knopfler's beautiful closing riffs in Calling Elvis are gone while Private Investigations suffers a similar fate. The live version of Local Hero is gracious but not representative of the rock version on the soundtrack.In short this is a disappointing compilation of Dire Straits' great work. In fact, it is strange that the record companies have not worked out that this sort of offering is exactly why people make their own compilations. This CD is ""Money for nothing"". Buy the original CDs and burn your own favorites!"
3,Damaged-ish,The box that was delivered to my house was incredibly damaged. Thankfully nothing inside was hurt. Other than the marred box the product seems to be working just fine.
5,Vinyl Ecstasy,"Simply put, I truly love my vinyl LP collection. From the album cover art work to the superb sound (compared to the diminished highs and lows of a CD), they are a joy. The Billboard Book of Top 40 Albums fulfills my need to know more about my favorite music, groups and individuals. It is chock full of fun tidbits, history of music and much more. I continually enjoy referencing this book as I listen to my music."
1,Poor colors,Colors don't match any other ACU gear I have. Bandana has a brownish tint and all colors look faded. I would not recommend nor purchase again.
2,they couldn't put 4 bandanas into an envelope and slow reply.,"okthey shorted me 2 bandanas and took a week to answer me and charged me $35 shipping on $5 in items, light items too.poor. the auto system on there view was stock and never contacted me in a timely fashion.I don't count a legal reply on your customer window as a reply giving a false sense of customer service.never again from these people again."
2,bandana,"This was a bandana, it was made of cloth, and is black, it serves the purpose of any other bandana, and was really over priced, cheaper at walmart, and less hassle of shipping a bandana"
1,Red Camo Is Not Even Red,"I was just looking for a red colored bandana for Airsoft and I thought this would work... Unfortunately, I was wrong. It is not a RED camo bandana - it's more of a BRICK color (more brown than red).I would NOT suggest anyone buying this."
5,Service de qualité,"service de qualité, rapidité, conforme à la commande, très très bien, je recommanderais dans votre boutique.Très satisfait."
3,Good in shape but small,"I like the colour and the pattern is really beautifulBut unfortunately 22""x22"" is really small and it is not useful for that"
1,American Flag made in China,"How's that for contradiction. My husband was so excited to get this and wear it while riding his Harley. He got stuck in the rain and the colors on the flag started bleeding. Completely destroyed, since the white has turned pink."
1,a scam,"these bandanas are nothing the add says they are. Any other positive reviews are probably from the company themselves. They absorb nothing, are a rough, polyester type, good for decorating only. Don't buy these unless thats your need."
1,Disappointed,"I wanted an American Flag Bandana and this one was pretty cheap, so I bought it. I guess you get what you pay for. It is made of a coarse material, not very comfortable to wear. There is a large ""Made in China"" marking on one corner, which I don't like to see on my American Flag, not that I care where it was made. Lastly, the colors ran as soon as I washed it, luckily I just washed it in the sink and not with my clothes, but the white stripes are now pinkish. I thought these colors don't run! Oh well at least it was cheap."
2,Poor Quality,I bought this product to go with a subdued pink camouflage pants I bought and love. It was cheaply made and basically looks like a piece of cloth with the edges sewn. There is little pink in it and the pink is so light it is difficult to see.
4,Even a Great Product has issues,"I bought this bandana to use for skiing. I figured that the 27"" x 27"" bandana would provide more than sufficient coverage for my face and neck while racing down the hill. The only issue that I found with this product is that the fabric is not soft, but is rough and stiff. It keeps your face warm, and looks great with just about any color jacket. Great Product."
4,Not soft,"Nice big dimensions. First washing softened it up by half, but still sort of stiff. Hoping future washings will soften it further. So far, so good!"
2,smells like pesticide,I thought it would be better/thicker material for the price. It says 100% cotton but feels like sandpaper. It smells like pesticide.
3,"Move along, nothing to see here.",Everything is fine with it I'm just not crazy about it. I just bought it to see how I would like a bigger one but I don't like it as much as I thought.
2,Cheap,"Thinner than expected, stiff and itchy even after washing, and all three that I ordered came out of the package with stains on them.If you want a cheap bandana, cut up an old t-shirt. These aren't worth the admittedly small cost."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,The print was only on one side of the bandana. VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DID NOT PROVIDE A STATEMENT IN THE DESCRIPTION...
1,very cheap dye,when i washed this thing the colours bled like the elevator from the shineing. it was intantly ruined. made in china
2,What did I expect?,"Thin. Poorly dyed. Cheap.The bandana I purchased was an olive drab paisley (trainmen as they call it).I'm not sure what I expected for like 4 bucks, but it was more than I got. I wouldn't recommend using these for anything. These are really cheap.Lets look at the advertised product.Made From 100% Cotton! - Maybe....but with only 20% of the fabric one would expect!Measures: 22"" x 22"" for Regular & 27"" x 27"" for Jumbo! - Fine...my bandana does measure 22""x22"".Choose From Colors: ACU Digital Camouflage, City Camouflage, Desert Camoulfage Six Color, Tri-Color Desert Camouflage, Pink Camouflage, Red Camouflage, Savage Orange Camouflage, Sky Blue Camouflage Camouflage, Subdued Pink Camouflage, Pink Camouflage, Tiger Stripe Camouflage, Ultra Violent Camouflage, Woodland Camouflage & More! - I got the right color--how long will it stay the right color?Sewn All Around On 4 Sides. - Until it is used or washed."
1,the black and red one is an abomination,"We ordered several different colors and patterns, all by Rothco. The others were thin but serviceable, and we should have expected that the low price would reflect the quality; but the black one is worthless. After being worn once, and washed once, the edges began to unravel. I suppose it is better than using, say, a paper towel or maybe a brown paper sack but never again will we order anything like this from Rothco."
4,Normal quality looks more Nylon than cottony,the colers are good exepet the blue one looks close to black then Dark blue dont expect it to be a High quality Bandana but it still do the job'''''
3,"Blaze Orange, wasn't so blazing....","I ordered 2 Blaze Orange bandannas, but to me they are not true blaze orange. They are more yellow orange compared to other neon/blaze orange clothing I have. They still work to help me seen at night during my walks, but still not as bright and pronounced as I would have liked."
1,Do not order this product unless you feel like wearing a placemat on your head.,I dislike this product. It would cost more to return the products then to keep them. I'm terribly unhappy because when I opened up delivery and looked at the product I felt like I had ordered placemats. I double checked my order and it said bandana's but I will never use these. I just lost money.
5,I just love the pattern always have!,it's a make shift bandage turnakit or towel what ever and its very well made but you do have to wash it multiple times before it will be soft.
2,Unrealistic,"Yes, clearly there is an image of an eagle, a globe, and an anchor, but the details are hardly consistent with that familiar icon loved by all leathernecks. I use it as a liner for my bike helmet, and it was cheap, but don't buy it for the emblem. I can't call it a true Marine Corps Emblem, it's just a haphazard knock-off. I suppose those in China who manufactured it don't see significance in the discrepancies, but I do."
4,Dog Housebreaking Pads,"While I use the pads for an older dog I rate them very good. Living in a high rise senior building, and confined to a wheel chair I find they are easy to use. Im considering keeping up the use of them because I am going to have some major surgery in the near future and it is eaiser for me to use them than to take the dog outside for now."
3,Kind of pricey,"Good product, and the larger size is convenient, but you can get smaller ones a lot cheaper at your local store."
5,Product that works!,"We use this product for our small, adult poodle when she can't go outside, or at night when she uses it on her own. The size is perfect for her enclosure. Never had a leak problem.I saw something very similar in use at a hospital ICU for people. I couldn't see a brand, but it looked identical."
5,The Best Yet for Adult Dogs !,"These pads are the best yet for use by adult dogs. They are of a good, larger size and do not tend to shred at all. Worth the cost, which is quite high. You're getting more coverage space for your money, which I believe is why they are not more modestly priced. Very absorbant pads."
4,great help with an aging pet,the larger size of these pads really help maximize the area covered. at first problem with my dog displacing the pads because he tends to pace. a piece of masking tape on the corner quickly and efficiently fixed that problem.
3,GOOD & BAD,"I've been buying these for months because of the size. My dogs were WEEWEE pad trained because I worked. They are now almost 3, I don't work and the only thing that has changed is the PRICE of this product. The price increased by $5.00 per pack in the last month or so. $16.99 to $21.99 is a HUGE increase. The product is very good, but could only give it 3 stars because of the price. If the product had improved & was thicker, larger or something, it wouldn't be too bad. A 25% increase is crazy!"
5,A Handy Version of the Old Scofield,"The small-sized version of Oxford's Old Scofield bible is a perfect blend of portability and scholarship. This is C.I. Scofield's 1917 version, which uses the KJV text along with Scofield's study aids--cross references, explanations, and introductions to each book. It also has two indexes (one for names, one for subjects) and a concordance as well as an index to the Scofield elements."
4,Nice Bible,"Good study bible with many references and interpretations. Although helpful in providing more information and insight into God's word, some of the the interpretations listed in the study notes should be taken with a grain of salt."
5,Excellent notes for understanding dispensationalism,"The Scofield Bible is the Bible of choice for many Christians seeking to understand how to apply II Timothy 2:15, ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."" via dispensational study methods."
2,To much Scofield and no meat !!,"The only reason I gave it 2 stars is becuase Scofield gave it an honest try but, comes up short. Spirtually speaking you will starve to death reading this Bible if your hungry for the truth.The best thing I have to say about it is his headlines are accrurate (most of the time) but, you will be just as hungry whem you are finshed reading, as you were when you started.Scofield follows the traditions of man to the tilt. So if you into traditions this could be for you. However I do not recommend this Bible, I recommend The Companion Bible by E W Bullinger, whereby traditions of men and Church ""systems"" are not followed and, you are fed meat instead of milk. Sincerly,Your Friend and Brother, In Christ Jesus."
2,Conservative!!!,"I am a rather conservative Christian myself, but the notes in this Bible are conservative to the point of being INSANE! Not to mention the fact that they are out of date: Most of the notes were penned in 1909!"
4,Large Print Excellence,"When it comes to study bibles I have found the Schofield to be well organized, thought provoking and generally reliable in its information. To find it in a large print, with all of the features, and leather bound at such a reasonable price was almost too good to be true. I purchased four of them for various people I know who require larger print. This included my wife who loves it."
1,Not the Real Thing,"For people who have been caught unaware, the ""New Scofield Bible"" is not a ""Genuine"" Old Scofield Bible. C.I. Scofield died in 1921. The New Scofield was put together in 1967 by an independant committee. They added numerous notes that certainly would not have agreed with Dr. Scofield. Example: Acts 8:12- They talk about baptism being not only done by immersion, but by sprinking and pouring. The KJB explains that true water baptism is by immersion only. They also mess with the KJV text by adding double meanings that are different from the Old Scofield Bible. For people wanting to buy a Scofield Bible because of the author's great umderstanding of the scriptures, should be advised to buy the ""Real One"". For people who don't care, anything on the market will do."
4,Excellent notes,"C.I. Scofield's notes are written from a dispensational approach to theology. It is based on a belief in a historical/gramatical approach to the Bible. Many would say it is a system helps make sense out of Scripture. I agree. Understanding the difference between Israel and the Church and that God administered His faith/grace relationship with people differently throughout human history is clearly taught in these wonderful notes. Some of the material is obviously outdated because of new discoveries in archeology and science. However, the basic notes on the biblical covenants and prophesy are as rich today as the day they were written.This is a wonderful Bible for people who are trying to make sense out of the Bible.Thank you Dr. Scofield, Oxford Press and Philadelphia College of Bible."
4,A Diamond In The Rough,"Debating is exciting, but the coaching or teaching of it is rather difficult to do. There are so many boring books on the subject, but Hill's book is not. It is straight forward, and while Canada does use a different format now, the basics are still basics. There are very few points that are completely NOT applicable to Canadian Debating, but in sharp contrast many points are fully applicable.fThis was a very good resource, but as you can see from another review, I do have a favourite. But, if you can afford a few books on debate in your library, this should be one as well."
2,limited,This book is primarily aimed at educators writing grants for school or community projects. It is not particularly useful if you intend to write a scientific grant.
2,"If this costs $9.99, then buy it","I tested this over 10 hours with various distances and configurations with the Linksys signal monitor on. You can watch the signal/noise numbers jump up and down. With this product, in some cases, you will get some gain and in some cases, you'll get zero gain. It depends on where the wireless access point is located and what it in the way. For what you are paying $50+, just go ahead and get an WRT54GX SRX router through TigerDirect.com, get a linksys repeater (range expander), or an access point in repeater mode."
1,Falsy advertised; does NOT work with all the versions of WRT54G,These antennas are advertised as replacements antennas for the WRT54G. That is only partially true... Antennas on the WRT54G V8 cannot be replaced with those (there is no connector).Verify that your router has a TNC connector before purchasing (not like me...). Not all routers have a connector.
1,Doesn't work,"Just received the antenna, and I'm disappointed in the poor performance. No improvement at all. On the other hand, I installed the range extender. A little difficulty in the installation, but it works like a charm. Buy the range extender; forget the antenna."
1,Little to No improvement,"I had high hopes that this product would increase the signal strength on my WRT54G wireless router. However, I can see little to no improvement in the weak areas and dead spots of my house."
1,Mistake,"I was told the longer antenna's would send the signal further, but it never worked. I only got the same range from the long antenna as I did the shorter ones. I don't know how to solve this problem I only have to extend the range another 8 feet. The longer antenna did not do this for me."
1,Don't bother using from floor to floor,"In my on-going saga to connect my house wireless, I want to my local MicroCenter and asked for advice. After decribing my layout, the employee recommended this antenna.Took them home, hooked them up, and .... nothing. No change in my ""low signal"" problem.I looked on Amazon and a previous review by a Mr. Livingston (thanks!) described my problem exactly: I'm trying to connect wirelessly to a computer in my basement, and these antenna don't work for this problem.I'm returning them to MicroCenter today. (BTW, they charged me $52.00 for these!).Based on Mr. Livingston's review, these antenna may work if your set-up is on the same level in your house. If it's not, don't bother with these.Why is it that folks on Amazon seem to know more than the people who market these products?"
3,Works well BUT............,This high gain Antenna kit does what its supposed to do BUT you need to know exactly what your accomplishing by replacing your OEM antenna's with these. Example: My wireless router is located under my printer in my upstairs office and when I first installed the High Gain Antenna kit I gained nothing. However when I slightly relocated the router's position nearer to the window and with a better line of sight it significantly improved the connection range/quality.So I do recommend tihs product but you should have a plan to go along with it.Regards
2,A modest improvement -- don't expect miracles,"I live in a not-huge NYC apartment with solid plaster walls. The new antennas extended the range of my Linksys cable modem by maybe 10-15 feet, enough to allow my PC -- but not my wife's Mac -- to get service in a corner room that had previously been out of reach. A modest improvement, but (barely) worth the modest price of a set of second-hand antennas."
4,Some Gain,Seems to add gain over the original antenna. My application is a little tricky and that I will be placing the router on which there are used higher in the house to reduce initial loss. I expect that then the true gain from this antenna set will be noticed
3,try before you buy,"I have not used this product. I gave it 3 stars to be neutral. I considered buying this but...Another reviewer mentioned building an antenna ""enhancer"" from http://www.freeantennas.com/prod03.htmI did, and it worked for me. It took 15 minutes to build from (heavy) paper, tin foil and glue. It increased my signal from -78db to -65db and decreased noise from -88db to -92db on my Belkin PCI adapter. Took a little experimentation to align it, but I could not maintain a connection prior to using this."
2,Disappointing Results,"While installation is a snap, I did not achieve a net gain in signal strength. I am using a Linksys WRT54G router and a Linksys WUSB11 hooked up to a TiVo DVR. The signal was fine until I had to move the TiVo about 30' further away into another room, where my signal strength fluctuates from 5% to about 25%, poor to marginal. I get up to a max of 30% at times with two HGA7T in a Linksys AS2TNC antenna stand, however, it usually hovers near 20% which is about what I averaged before. I plan on getting a Linksys WRE54G range expander, despite the configuration issues. I honestly expected to get much better results with the antennae than I did since all I did was move the WUSB11 into another upstairs room, whereas it had previously been directly above the room where the WRT54G was. I tried tweaking the placement of the antennae and the WUSB11, and the reported results were the best I could do. Some slight movements resulted in poorer reception."
4,Linksys HGA7T High Gain Antenna Kit for TNC Connectors,"Perhaps you peole are not tightening the antennas enough, thus giving it the right connection because I do see a big diference"
1,"Didn't help, waste of money!","I have a Linksys WRT54G version 6 router with the latest updated Linksys firmware. I tested the signal strength and it was 3-4 bars from across the house, prior to installation. I immediately installed the new high gain antenans and it did not change the signal strength at all, still 3-4 bars. I tried powering down the router and re-starting my computer and it never changed the signal. I installed the original antennas and it was still 3-4 bars, then I re-installed the high gain antennas and it never changed the signal strength, still 3-4 bars. It didn't matter what laptop I used or the location, nothing changed. It was a huge waste of money!"
3,cheaper alternative,"I was going to buy the high gain antenna but find the info regarding building your own directional antennahttp://www.freeantennas.com/prod03.htmI download the template and built the add on to my antenna in about 10 minutes out of cardbox and some left over wire mash screen that I had to cover the gutter from leaves. My before signal strength was about 50%, the after is 75%. Keep in mind if you need to increase the radio signal for 360 degrees, then buy the high gain but if you just have a problem of one of the computer in your house not getting a good signal then go to the above site."
3,"Pricey, but it worked.","I was looking to get just a bit more distance in my home. This gave me the extra 10% to 15% that I was looking for. Don't expect significant improvement though. Positioning of the wireless router and of the antenna themselves will help a lot. It takes some trial and error. Too bad the antenna cost almost as much as the wireless router itself. I would have given a 4 rating, but the price pushes it down to a 3 in terms of value."
1,Don't waste your money,I have two WRT54G routers. One is an older version 1.1 and the other a brand new version 5. I set both routers next to each other with the old one on channel 13 and the new one on channel 1. I tried each router with the stock antennas and then with these high gain antennas and compared the signal strength with netstumbler from about 30 feet away. I was shocked to see the difference in signal strength was hardly noticeable. Not worth the money IMHO.I'll be returning these to the store today.
1,Won't Fit Most Linksys Routers,Why oh why wouldn't they standardize connections for all their products?The threads on these antennea are too small for many Linksys routers; most notably the new WRT54GX.Their customer support could use an overhaul as well.
1,Dissappointing - pure and simple,"What a complete waste of time and money. I had - and still have - poor reception in my bed room and I bought these antennas to improve the situation. Now the problem has gone from bad to slightly worse. I could quote signal strength and signal to noise ratios, but honestly, I find a simple file transfer more revealing. Before installing the antennas I could download with 370KB/s to the bedroom. Immediately after installing the antennas the average transfer rate of the same 67MB file dropped to 195KB/s."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"Absolutely no change in signal strength or speed. When I called the Linksys line I was told that I ""obvously had a defective one and should exchange it."" Then I read the amazon reviews. Next time I will look first!"
5,Great Product,"Great response time on product, recieved it before I expected it :) Also it works like a dream, cleaned up those signals and keeps me connected more often. Would recommend these to anyone who has a large distance to push the wireless signal."
4,Seems to work as advertised,"The antennas were easy to attach and appears to have resolved my signal reception problem. However, I would have been more impressed if Linksys's system had a strong enough signal in the first place."
4,Satisfied in California,Works as advertised. Shipment took several days from Florida to California. It was shipped regular ground via USPS. The kit arrived in safely and was easy to install.I needed to beef-up the signal from one bedroom to another (about 30ft thru two lathe and plaster walls) for my teenage son who plays on-line interactive video games.
2,Not so good,I tought that the range of this'd be more. Not too much diferences with the ones of the AP
2,Have to thank Mr Chow for his cheaper alternative,"I hade actually bought a supposed Hawking 15db high gain antenna and replaced one of my linksys antennas with it. But, still the signal in my upstairs bedroom was very low. After seeing the cheaper alternative noted by Mr Chow,http://www.freeantennas.com/prod03.htmI made the simple EZ 10 reflector in 5 minutes by stapling some aluminum foil to some manila folder card stock, folding at 90 degrees and placing behind the remaining linksys antenna and.... voila, my signal was immediately boosted to an acceptable level... fantastic... wish I had known about it sooner before I spent good money on that expensive Hawking that didn't get the job done !"
2,Bummer. I was hoping they'd make a difference,"I have a linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless-B Cable/DSL Router and I like it a lot! However, my signal was poor when I was at one end of the house. I knew it was just part of the limitations (it's about 70 feet away and it has to go through floors and walls. My signal would alternate between ""Very Low"" and unavailable. Then I read about these antennas, and I thought this would give it enough boost so I wouldn't have to add another WAP to cover the distance. Well, it didn't work out that way. It does keep my connection at ""Very low"" most of the time and sometime it goes to unavailable. I don't think it was worth the $44 that I paid for them. But I knew it was a calculated risk, so I'll probably get another WAP, put it in the laundry room under my bedroom so I can have a more reliable connection!"
4,"Excellent, but...",Excellent product but the position of the antennas is critical. It doesn't work if you put it in a good place in your house.
1,Not worth it for my layout,"I bought the HGA7S for use with my Linksys WMP54GS, and at the same time bought the HGA7T antenna pair for use with my Linksys WRT54G. No improvement at all in signal quality, and if anything quality has dropped. PC is in room on second floor, WRT54G is across the hall behind two normal wooden interior doors. Prior to new antennas signal was in the mid 60s, now with the new ones I'm in the mid 50s - low 60s. I was hoping for a rise into the 70s.These antennas might work for someone else, but so far for my layout they've been a waste of money. I also bought the WRE54G range extender, which isn't here yet, so hopefully once that arrives my signal quality will improve."
2,didn't work for me,"I got 0~1 bars on my wifi detector and hoped that this would help. But it didn't get any better. You'll have to get some decent signal beforehand in order to get this antenna to make things better for you, I suppose."
1,High Gain = no gain,"I replaced the antennae on my Linksys WRT 54G with their high gain antennae and got absolutely no benefit whatever. I would award this product 0 stars, but that is not an option."
1,NO HELP AT ALL ..,I bought these and INstalled just as said. Simply REMOVE old ones and INSTALL new ones. NO HELP AT ALL .. I get the SAME signal strength as before. My laptop is CENTRINO P4. It is on the SAME LEVEL as the router only at the other end of the house. I got NO help from the antenna at all. SMH oh well.... I will be re-turning these at once..Will try a DIFFERENT product from Linsys.
3,Adds a bit of range.... sometimes.,First off They are large. But only gained about 10-15% increase in signal strength and about 10-15 feet in range. This was in an typical office setting. I can now reach the board rooms and other areas of the office with my WiFi connection.It had absolutely no effect when I used it in a Condo unit. A unit three stories above me lost the signal. Before we where able to get the signal from the Linksys Wireless G router but after these antenna's the signal was gone. The Condo unit is old and build largely of cement (and I am sure lead based paint).I use the same antenna kit in both locations. I first tired it at the condo then I took them to work.The price is high for a rather low gain and hit and miss success rate.
5,Works Very Well,I bought the antennas and the range expander. Very impressed with the antennas. Signal strength improved and no longer fluctuates as did before install. Router is 50 feet from computer; through 3 walls. Would recommend this purchase first before a range expander.
2,They don't go with the WCG200,"I bought these because Amazon popped them up under ""Better Together"" as a buy together deal. The Linksys WCG200 gateway (and most pci wireless cards) use SMA connectors, not TNC.The gateway has only one antenna, not two. I believe the older Linksys routers used TNC antennas, and there were two. That's probably where the association of these antennas to the Linksys products originated.The antennas look like a quality product and the price was right, they just don't go with the product they're being sold as ""better together"" with."
1,Did not help with my reception problem,"I had a bad spot in my house where my wireless signal was almost non-existent (everything is on the same floor) -- unfortunately this bad spot is where a desktop computer with a wireless PCI card lives. I first tried a Hawking high gain directional antenna at the desktop (i.e. receiving end). This seemed to help a little, but the signal was still unreliable. I then tried the Linksys high-gain antenna kit in the hopes of boosting the signal from the router to an exceptable level, but it did not seem to help AT ALL. I have since given up and am going with the wired option to this computer."
1,Cisco-Linsys 7db dual antennae,After receiving this item I installed it. 3 of my 6 WiFi radios quit working. The other 3 had low signal warnings. I had the seller send me a new one with the same negative results. The stock antennae on my Linksys WRT5GL works much better. The TNC connection is almost obsolete. Most companys use the SMA connection. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this poor product. It simply doesn't work well.
1,Did not work for me,"I decided to buy the Linksys high gain antenna to extend the range of my Linksys wireless-G router. Although it was very easy to install compared to the reported difficulties in configuring the Linksys wireless range expanders, the high gain antenna did little to improve my signal strength in my upstairs location of my networked laptop. For me this product was a waste of money."
1,Don't believe the hype,I tested the High Gain Antenna against the original Antenna with the wireless computer in the same room (75% signal strength was achieved). There was not a significant differance. I moved the router into the next room and could not get more than 50% connection strength. I am totally disappointed because until now I had faith in Linksys. That is the last product I will buy from them.
2,Hi Gain Antenna,"Unfortunately this antenna additon does not seem to make much, if any difference in the performance of our LAN. The distance from the router to my Mac ibook is less than 30 feet through one tile wall and it continually looses the signal. The angle that the ibook is at is very critical. Moving an inch or two can cause a problem.j McCarthy"
4,Works...but,Increased the signal strength to my wife's laptop but she is still dropping the signal on occassion.
2,Look Impressive,Since I added these antennas I have seen no improvement in signal strength..Transmit or receive. I'm a ham radio operator and with upgraded antennas I would expect better performance. Since the router is flashed with DDWRT I can see all received signal strengths and they're all the same. So I'm not returning the but I am also not recommending them. I'll continue to look for a better antenna.
2,very LITTLE benefit,"These antennas maybe gave me 5% more coverage and they look like they would do much more. It also made the router much more cumbersome and it falls easier now. It really isnt worth it, dont pay more then 20$ for them, get them used if possible.C-"
3,It works.....fair,It definitely increases signal strength. It did not improve signal strength to another desktop nor laptop as much as I had hoped. Don't expect big gains with the antenna kit.
4,The new high-gain antennae did improve my wireless router's range.,"I have been generally pleased with this purchase, as now I have several more rooms in which I can access the wireless net in my rather large house."
2,Don't let your hope hight -- minimal performance enhancement,"I'm using a HGA7T with WRT54GS. My router is placed downstair while all my desktops with wireless adapter is upstairs. It does increase the signal strength, but with a bare minimal sense. The weak signal spots are all still weak as before and inconsistent.I bet you will have better luck buying a WAP54G instead of this."
4,Excellent book for,"homeschooling about the west. It has lots of nice crafts to do. Although, the fort they had an example did not work for us. We had to improvise with lots of hot glue."
4,Very good... but not the best of Makeba,"It's certainly a beautiful CD, with gorgeous music. But... I grew up with the music of Miriam Makeba on her older LP's, and quite frankly, her voice during the 60's and 70's was so exceptionally beautiful -- I truly think hers was one of the 2 or 3 greatest voices I've heard, up there with Ella -- that it's just not the same. Don't let me dissuade you from buying this CD, it's very, very good, and anyone who likes, traditional S. African music will *really* like this CD. But if you want to hear the real Makeba, with a voice so beautiful it sends a chill down your spine, you have to go to earlier materials. I hope the record companies release her early material some day."
1,Plastic Poles Easily Break,"When setting up the net, we were disappointed that the included poles were actually plastic and not metal. Once bringing the net to a decent tension, one of the poles split on the seam. Family was SO excited when we got this today, but unfortunately we don't get to play. What a disappointment!!"
1,Poor quality,"This product is not well made. In other words, it does not live up to its marketing. First off, a zipper tab on the carry bag broke off on first use. The net, poles, and accompanying strings worked OK to set up. The rackets were not very strong and after one day of play [by young people], two of them began to bend. To top it off, in the next week, we saw a better-made badminton set for sale at Menard's for 2/3 the price. Ouch! Caveat emptor!"
3,Good price for the set but quality is just average,"I bought this set for the kids to play in my backyard.The price is good but the quality is average or lower.The birdies are cheap plastic and would come right through/in the string of the rackets.The rackets are very flimsy; the black plastic wraps are so thin it come right off after a few plays.The kids did have a good time with it, though but I think after one summer it will go into the recycle bin.Save your money and buy a better quality set, if you want something to last."
2,cheap racquets too,"I was warned by others about the poles, but the racquets and the shuttlecocks are cheap too. They get stuck it the racquets and stop the game. It is still fun having the set, but really just buy a more expensive one. You won't regret it."
1,"LOVE the Lime, but it last for about 30 seconds...","Not much more to say than the title, but that's exactly the case, i LOVE the lime scent, it is sharp and tangy, not far off from real lime by the way! But maybe with a slightly margarita-tinge. yum, i love it. But the smell doesn't last longer than a minute, even if i spray 10 sprays of it. :(. Total bummer."
1,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed in this product. I paid for a premium fragrance to give us that real Christmas tree smell and got something that smells just like the cheap pine bathroom deodorizers of years ago.
2,Demeter Fragrance Library,"I purchased the Honeysuckle.The scent was pleasing, however,I can walk down a househld aislein the supermarket and pick upsomething for less then 1/2 the pricethat smells just as nice."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I bought ""Thunderstorm"" and it is absolutely aweful! Not a clean fresh storm like I expected but wet dirt and dust. Not at all what I want people smelling when they walk into my home. I was very disapointed! If you're into this sort of smell more power to you, but it's not at all something I would ever buy again."
1,Nothing like it!,I bought Mildew thinking it would smell sort of like damp towels that had been in the bathroom for a couple of days but was disappointed to find it smelled more like sports liniment. Will next try thunderstorm.
5,The most beautiful tarot deck I've ever seen,"You have to see this tarot deck to truly enjoy it. It's colors are rich and the drawings are very expressive. The meaning of the cards are well expressed in the pictures.Truly one of a kind. Most tarot decks have blaise borders and pale colors. Not this one. Each picture is artfully done. On top of that the picture dominates the entire card, there is no border, so the card really stands out.The only negative is the plain blue with white stars back. With such a beautiful face the backing is somewhat of a dissappointment."
1,Don't buy this deck!,"The Morgan-Greer tarot deck is full of bright, yellow colour that is almost sickening. The paintings are quite nice themselves apart from the intense colours on many cards, but they are so plastic they slide all over the place and feel too smooth to the touch. The corners of the cards are too curved so that they get damaged from shuffling very easily. The dark blue cover of the deck looks quite appealing but I was unpleasantly surprised when I took out the cards."
5,Very nice...,The cards are beautiful and got to me fast. The cards are also bigger than I thought they would be. Great job.
3,"Nice Deep Colours, Too Close-Up","Definite 'clone' of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck. This is pretty much considered a 'Classic' amongst Tarot enthusiasts.The twist this deck has to offer is the up-close and personal feel of the cards. Some people love it for that aspect...I found that I would rather like to see what is going on around the characters, rather than just stare at their pretty faces.The artwork is very round, and the colours are very rich and deep. A little too cartoon-y. I read somewhere someone really likened this deck to the 70's Era.I purchased this deck to replace my Original Rider-Waite-Smith (as I did not connect with it at all), upon reading many recommendations for this deck as a ""starter""/""beginner""/""RWS Alternative""... I found that I much rather connect with the Universal Waite."
3,"Nice illustrations, but...","This book is OK. The premise held promise: a turn-of-the-century balloonist lands on Krakatoa and finds a fanciful civilization. But there was just something about all the lengthy descriptions of impossible inventions that struck me as not quite whimsically surreal, but rather just plain annoying. The illustrations were fun, but overall I just couldn't get into it."
5,A great book!,"I really, really enjoyed this book. I sat there reading, and reading, and reading. I finished it in barely a day because it kept me alert and in suspense. You should definitely read it! :)"
5,My students loved it.,"I used Twenty-One Balloons as a literature set in my seventh grade class. The fun, cliff-hanging story entertained even the most jaded of my pre-teens. It lent very well to classroom use and I would recommend it to any student interested in light-hearted reading."
1,Worst. Book. Ever.,"This book is awful. I read it, and I couldn't wait to finish it. I would have flipped it in the trash can except I had to read it for school. The characters are pathetic, there is no grasp of dialogue, and the author admits that it is the same thing as an F. Scott Fitzgerald book that was already written. How it became a Newberry winner I will never know."
4,WOW!,"Before i bought the book, i wanted it to be an enjoyable book, one that is a hard read, and has a deep meaning. Well The Twenty-One Ballons is all of that. it has a great meaning. and is enjoyable. A read that i reccomend for readers who are trying to find something original, but having a deep meaning. Look at this book thoroughly though, because it's one of those ""Love it or hate it"" books."
2,the twenty one balloons,"I read this book for my daughter,she is 9 years old,was hard to read for herself,a difficult words for her age,we had to buy this book cause her school told us.we love books that they keep the interest to continuing reading.and this is not the one.Sorry"
5,Good Book!,This is a good book. It's about a man who is trying to fly around the world but than he is shot down and lands on an island of Indonesia. He creates a bond with the people there and it is very interesting. You won't be able to keep your face out of it!Buy it today!!
5,I keep reading it over and over,"I first read this book when I was 11, and it has not lost its magic for me with each successive reading. The author's inventive imagination is apparent in the way that he believably ties in fact with fiction. Set against the background of a volcano waiting to erupt, this story also manages to appreciate the beauty of balloons. Professor Sherman's adventures are page-turning, all the way up to the explosive finish. This book is highly recommended."
4,Twenty-One Balloons Flying Around.....,"I would give the book The Twenty-One Balloons by William Pene du Bois, four stars because it's fun to read! This book is about a man that is an unusual teacher who likes to travel. He ends up in a storm on a hot air balloon and crashes on an island nobody had ever found! The man discovers new things with a new friend and travels around the island. This book is full of new things in every page! There will be things you would like to play with and places you would want to go to! I strongly recommend this book to people who like non-fiction books and want to try fiction books, but a book with some reality. I do not recommend this book to people who like descriptive books because this book is a little short and the details are crumpled up. Pick up this book and read it today!-By: Jaymin-"
5,An Enduring Story of a Very Significant World Event,"It was 59 years ago when I first encountered the book 21 Balloons. Our teacher would read a portion of this book to us when we had completed our class work. As a class, we could hardly wait to hear the next installment of the adventures on Krakatoa and to learn about the excitement and adventure of balloon travel.I found this book extremely interesting that many years ago and now am delighted to introduce it to my grandchildren who are also interested in volcanoes and volcanic activity.For a book to to have that much impact over the years, it must be worthwhile reading for children. I was just delighted that 21 Balloons was still in print.Dr. Robert F. Marble"
5,A Classic,"It won a Newbery Award in 1948, and it will be obvious to any reader why it won. I don't feel qualified to say much about it, because I bet this guy's been reviewed by far better than me. But damn, there is just so much fuel for your imagination in here. He's given me much that I will remember for many years. So I strongly suggest that you Google around for some reviews of this, and then you'll be impressed, and then you'll read it, and then you'll love it forever. It's allegedly for children, but it's also the second book in my entire reviewing career that I feel like slapping the word ""marvel"" onto. Yeah, I marveled."
3,PATCHY !!!,A very patchy and therefore underwhelming compilation. One or 2 tracks are outstanding and I quite like hearing the development of 'Some Lovin' (Murk vs Kristine W) from its original recording by Liberty City to the way it is sampled on other tracks however the few highlights do not justify the cost of this double CD.The one redeeming feature is the more I listen the more I begin to like so in a few months I might give this a 5 star. Truly only for those wanting to spend >$30 and who love that deep kathunk kathunk of the bass which seems to dominate 'the Miami Sound'.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I bought the game and it never would start. My OS (Pentium 300) and SVGA card (128MG) were not the problem. I was really excited to do my ""Coast Guard"" thing, but no joy. Totally bummed in Dixie....."
3,A little plastic looking,"Okay--A little plastic looking, I have faux leather boots by other brands and they don't look quite so plastic. Otherwise comfortable."
2,Basic Black Boots,"This a very basic black boot. I choose these because I was 5 months pregnant at the time and wanted something a bit stylish yet low to the ground to help me avoid trips or falls. If you are into a very basic, minimalist look, these boots are for you. If not, stick with stalletos -- always my first choice."
5,This stuff is amazing,"Ok, I don't really listen to punk rock, and I hadn't really heard of this band until about 20 minutes ago. But, as it turns out, the lead singer of this band, Dallas Denery, is now my history professor at Bowdoin College and is now teaching the world about the relationship between science and religion during the Middle Ages. How ""sweet"" is that?"
1,unsatisfied,"This item does not run true to standard sizing. We ordered women's large and it is so small it looks more like a girls size large. There is no way, if this is standard sizing, that an XLarge would fit either. Unless you are very petite, we suggest not purchasing this product. John and Miriam Ganze"
4,Does the job but did not Wow me,"The set came with a well constructed package. Each of the speakers is wrapped with a cloth so they are well protected from any scratch due to mis-handling. The 5.1 system is easy to install with my receiver. I used this together with the KEF wireless connection for the rear speakers. The calibration is done with a microphone supplied and is easy to do. This set is expensive (so is the wireless transmitter receiver set) and I would expect it to deliver outstanding sound. The sound it produces it not impressive. I thought it is due to the wireless connection. But the sound quality per speaker does not change much if I only use the front speakers, which are hardwired. It certainly lacks the brightness in the highend and midrange. I hope it is not due to my age of losing the hearing sensitivity. See my other review related to the Soudbar."
3,Disappointingly hoity-toity,"Okay, say the editors, it's Saturday and some friends are coming over, and you decide to just ""throw something on the grill, make a salad, and buy a pie at the bakery."" Hah! You can do better than that, they say. Just whip up some Belgian Endive Spears with Fontina & Walnut Filling as a ""last-minute dinner."" Gimme a break! And under ""Lazy Sundays,"" they suggest Port-Poached Figs with Butter-Toasted Rosemary Almonds and Prosciutto. Now, I'm a pretty fair cook, but this is not the sort of thing you can do with one hand tied behind your back. And while some of these dishes -- the few that actually are illustrated -- look tempting, the title of the book is extremely misleading, because there ain't nothing ""casual"" about it."
5,Nice Speaker Stands,Love these speaker stands. Ive even bought several different sets that were different hights. I use them for speakers (of course) but also they are handy for putting the smaller ionic breeze on to keep it off the floor. Also really liked the prices for these stands compared to other brands.
4,Sony Ericsson Wall Charger,"I left my original wall charger while travelling so i had to get a new one for my Sony Ericsson P990i. It charges my phone to a full in 1.5 hours, and it's REALLY CHEAP. My old charger looked sleeker and charged my phone in 40-45mins. But for the price, you can't complain!"
1,the quality sucks.. No comments.,It does not match my sony cellphone very well. I just use one time and throw it to corner. so I advise you not buy this items even it is very cheaper. Please buy the original charger if possible.
2,Would be better if it was the item I ORDERED!!!,I ordered a wall charger and got a car charger that someone else ordered. How do I know that someone else ordered it? Because his picking slip was in my package! What a disappointment!
4,It is what it says it is,"I like the shape of the plug so that it doesn't cover up any other outlets. It works, what else can I say?"
4,Does it's job,"I have a W810i, and my last charger that came with the phone was beginning to fail. So I explored the option of a new charger, hoping that I could find one for dirt cheap, and hoping that it was an issue with the charger and not my phone. Needless to say, when you can get something for 2 cents, which I did (plus the $2.98 in S&H;) that is a great deal in any regard.It works. Plain and simple my W810i has survived falling down 500 foot mountainsides, water damage, as a doggy chew toy, flying out of my lap from the car onto hard asphalt, who knows how many times, and so on, and I am glad it will continue to survive for hopefully at least another year or two.The one problem with this charger is it is a little snug when I plug my phone in, and occasionally the phone will keep beeping (signaling it is beginning to charge) until I unplug it and plug it back in. Just an issue with an old phone I guess, and a charger that may be slightly too big. Other than that I am satisfied!"
1,I don't know what's going on with mine,"I really have no idea what's going on with mine but I received it at the amazing price but unfortunately it is not getting charged at all (the Sony Ericsson) phone and I am 100% sure there is nothing wrong with the phone. I just lost my phone charger so I ordered a new one. It fits and all but it doesn't charge, I don't know why :( I guess I was just lucky enough to get a defective one :("
4,"It works well, but be forewarned","The product is good, but if you do not have a head unit, you will not be able to hear it as the output is only a few volts with no power. So it's barely audible through a car speaker. YOU WILL NEED AN AMPLIFIER WITH VOLUME CONTROL ON IT!!! It does work good though and gets TONS of stations.I'd buy it again, but I know what I need now. Easy wiring too. And there is no volume control on this unit...at all..."
4,A fine refresher on macroeconomics,"Robert Heilbroner is one of the better economic authors in the last 25 years. His style of writing is amazing, direct and incredibly insightful. This book is a basic explanation of macroeconomics and he did a great job explaining the fundamentals of the Fed and Treasury dept. I'm not sure this book should be ones first reading into this subject matter, but Heilbroner is such a clear writer that the concepts will just jump off the pages."
3,Good product but misleading advertising,"When I was looking for a sushi/sashimi knife, I specifically chose this one because it was advertised as being fully forged high-carbon steel, the only one with those specifications in this price range. However, the knife comes with a sticker on it that very clearly states ""NOT FORGED"". If you look at the knife closely, you can tell that it is stamped rather than forged. This is not in itself a bad thing, as it is still a very nice knife and a good deal for the price. I would give it 5 stars if not for the misleading advertising and conflicting product literature."
3,Good but expires too soon,"This is good software, but it expires too soon to be useful to a college student. I have two weeks in the semester left, now I have to use notepad and compile in jdk 1.3 because the Enterprise trial version expired before the semester was over.Why can't companies like Borland offer free trial versions of their software that will work through the entire semester for college students? A semester is not 60 days long, it's longer. Companies could ship the software with textbooks and it would be free advertising. As soon as the student gets a good programming job and can afford the real software, they'll buy it."
4,Nice Bag,"A well made and functional bag. The bag did stink of made in china plastic type of chemicals when I first received it, but after a month the bag has lost most of that offensive odor. I use the shoulder strap carrying the bag and would have preferred a more padded strap but that's just me being picky. Top Bag and I would buy another, hopefully not for a good while."
1,"OH, IT WORKS BUT NOT HOW YOU WOULD LIKE!",This stuff killed what had to be over a hundred J-beetles in my yard in one day. Problem is I NEVER HAD THAT MANY BUGS UNTIL I BOUGHT THIS THING! Once and awhile there would be a few Japanese beetles in my garden. After I put this up one morning I came home from work and the bag was almost full and there were beetles EVERYWHERE!!!!!IT ACTUALLY ATTRACTS MORE INSECTS THAN YOU CURRENTLY HAVE.DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!
3,An exceedingly important book from the era,"This book is important because it is arguably THE book that defined the role of the female beatnik during the 50s and 60s - free spirit, roaming, finding your own path, etcetera. Even though I have read it through a couple of times though, I must say that the actual structure of the book is lacking something. I would have liked to have read more about her mental interactions with people rather than simply her physical ones - After all, the Beat generation was so much more than simply the birth of the free love movement. Big thumbs up to di Prima for being so blaringly honest, though."
1,So engrossed in sex as to be indistinguishable from porn.,"I picked this book up because of my interest in the Beats, feminist literature, and the American immigrant experience. I was disappointed on all three counts. First, the only thing Beat about it is the era depicted, though I think it is far more about 1969, the year of its publication, than the '50s. Secondly, writing explicitly about sex does not make a writer a feminist just because she also happens to be female. It merely makes her a female pornographer. Thirdly, what little is mentioned of di Prima's heritage seems somehow pathetic and ashamed. Too bad. I doubt I will go on to read other di Prima work, but I suppose there must be something there in order for her to have been so highly regarded. This book is a waste of time and money. How was it picked up by such a major publisher as Penguin? Could it be that important an artifact of the '60s? It offers us nothing of the Beat Generation, and is an embarrassment to it."
5,"The Beat Life, Oy Vay, What A Steamy Read","When I ordered this book I expected it to be nothing more than a slightly cleaned up recital of the beat life. My uncles told me how it was growing up about this time. They didn't tell me about this aspect of the beat life. At first I thought, this book is mere porno until I realized that this was just one facet of the beat life. An aspect that every generation has to deal with. No different, no better or no worse in learning on the run. A good book, if one to keep away from the kiddies."
4,Should we shy away from the physical passion?,"There is a paucity of well written accounts of ferociously developing sexuality. Would that I had such awareness when I entered the physical realm! This is not a non-fiction account of a literary group, but rather a slice of sensual life in an era now known as ""beat."" Any one book by an author should not be expected to stand alone as representational of a writer's life/work, and we should enjoy this volume for what it is, or what our imaginations can make of it. Read di Prima's poetry, her prose, immerse yourself in her word, before you judge. We don't have to like every book to know it's literary worth."
4,Interesting,This book has been both torn apart and praised but I seem to view it as something other than what most others do and in that I find entertainment and an intersting (if somewhat oversexed) version of her life. But that is the crux of the matter...it is entertaining and well written. Keep this in mind and you will enjoy it.
4,Still not sure...,"I've given this a listen once through and I'm still not sure if it's a good effort, a peculiarity or a work of genius. Thompson is Chocolate Genius for those who don't know and the two discs available under that name are NOTHING short of brilliant.Based on that I bought this. The record starts with typical 80's kind of dance groove thingy (technical terms abound here, eh?) but then track four appears out of nowhere; ""Monkey"" and WOW WOW WOW.Monkey makes it clear that the Chocolate Genuis we know and love WAS in fact alive and well in 89 when this record was released.At the very least this is an essential listen for fans of CG but if you don't have those discs yet, start there."
5,Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Abe ""starman"" Must have an IQ in the double digits. Psycho is one of the most classic movies in horror film history. By the way, it's Ed Gein (not Ed gaines). And when you speak of movies like Halloween and Hellraiser and Friday the 13th. Psycho paved the way for all of those mondern day classics. Psycho Rules. If you have not seen this movie, rent it now!!!!!!"
2,really widescreen?,"Hitchcock's deliciously black comedy would be brilliant in any aspect ratio, but let the buyer beware. As it was not filmed in a true widesreen format (VistaVision, Cimascope etc) this is in fact just a clipped version for the 16.9 market. More is, in this case, less."
2,really widescreen?,"Hitchcock's deliciously black comedy would be brilliant in any aspect ratio, but let the buyer beware. As it was not filmed in a true widesreen format (VistaVision, Cinemascope etc) this is in fact just a clipped version for the 16.9 market. More is, in this case, less."
1,A Sad Excuse For A Special Edition,"Psycho is one of my all time favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies. Having said that I have to say I was disappointed with this 2008 Legacy Series Special Edition. In 1998 Universal released a Psycho Collector's Edition (which is $5 cheaper) which compared to the 2008 release has a different format (a better format I think), the same bonus features as this new release, the only difference is the Collector's Edition is NOT a two disc set. Obviously I had the 1998 Collector's Edition prior to buying this one. I thought this newer one would be better, its not. I expected more for my money. The DVD is already $19.70 + $2.98 = $22.68 and for what? Basically you're paying more money for a 2nd disc. Save $5 and buy the one from 1998.Don't believe me? Open a new window and search Amazon for Psycho Collector's Edition and compare that one to the Legacy Series Special Edition on this page. Judge for yourself."
1,NOT the original aspect ratio.,I don't know why the Amazon review above says that this is the original aspect ratio (widescreen). The original movie was NOT shot in widescreen. I have the old VHS tape and the new DVD to prove it. Compare both the VHS tape and the DVD and you will see that they cut off the bottom and the top for the DVD to make it look like it was shot in widescreen. Hitchcock would be horrified! After all the trouble he went through storyboarding every camera shot.....
5,Breathtaking,"I had only seen Psycho once before making this purchase, but have been a huge Hitchcock fan ever since seeing Vertigo some years ago. I loved the film on first viewing and was blown away by it despite knowing the general plotline. This being the second time I'd seen the film, and the first time remastered on BluRay, I was once again absolutely floored by it. The picture quality gives it added depth, and I was absolutely transported. I'm currently checking out the special features and definitely recommend checking out The Making of Psycho that's included. This is an iconic masterpiece that's almost a necessity to own on BluRay for any fans of Hitch or film in general. Now, we just need Rear Window and Vertigo to be released."
5,There is a reason why this movie is on AFI's list (#1) for suspense/ horror films,"This is a classic movie, barnone. There are too many cultural references paying homage to this film for anyone not to recognize that. Even today, it is still my favorite suspense/horror film. Those other movies cannot compare, and I'm only in my early 30s.Buying this blueray has a lot of bonuses - just the ""Making Psycho"" documentary (one of MANY documentaries on this disc) is so worth it.The only complaint I have for this item is that there are no subtitles. I was SHOCKED to see that nothing was made available!!! Thankfully, the actors enunciated so well that you really don't need it."
5,Such a Classic,"I had to watch PSYCHO again for my Film Class, it is so good every time I watch it, they just don't make them like they used to!"
1,HORRIBLE OLD FILM SEE THE REMAKE!,This film is so boring and in the shower scene it was obviously Bates the wig even from shadow was awful. SEE THE REMAKE FAR MORE ENTERTAINING!
3,Great movie,It was a great movie however one of the discs was loose in transport and was scratched more than expected
4,A classic,"For the 1960's, this movie was great. But guess what? It's still so much fun to watch. I had my sixteen year old son watch it with me on Halloween."
5,Bates Motel. We Are Open. Come On In...,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.Regarded by some as the finest Hitchcock film ever, Psycho begins gently, then slowly turns dark before becoming terrifying in one of the most shocking scenes ever filmed. Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin are the principal actors this time around, and involved in another sinister game of suspense as only The Master can cook up. Sir Alfred Hitchcock has surprised you before, but never with anything like this.Miles away from civilisation lies the Bates Motel. You are cordially invited to stay for a night or two...Rated R, but should be rated PG (mild violence)."
4,Psycho's Given Great Treatment,"The picture and sound quality of Psycho on DVD are great. Bernard Herrmann's score is especially chilling. The strings all are sharp enough to send shivers racing down your spine toward the Bates Motel. The 90-minute documentary on the DVD is great, as are the other extras (which include the 6 minute trailer, promotional footage, production stills, and other things of the like).Unfortunately, the extra footage gets very redundant very quickly, with the promotional (and mislabeled ""newsreel"") footage basically restating what was said in the documentary. Not to mention, the promotional footage is redundant enough of itself. The static menus are a bit dissapointing also, but besides, Psycho is a great buy! One of my favorite DVDs."
5,Hey Amazon! Where are the actual main actors?,"Psycho is a classic. But my gripe is with the way Amazon takes the entire cast list, orders them in alphabetical order, then lists the first few actors from that list. And they tend to do this for a lot of movies here, not just this one.So in this case the ""stars"" of the film are Frank Albertson, Martin Balsam, Francis de Sales, and George Eldredge (as listed when you search Movies and TV for the film). And according to IMDB the last two were uncredited! Nice going, Amazon."
4,a masterpiece,this is a masterpiece any body that likes horror movies will really enjoy this movie some people say this is the first slasher film but it is acually a phycological thriller halloween was the first slasher but still a good film.
5,The best horror movie ever...One of the best films of all time,"Some movies we still talk about even though they where relesed over 50 years ago for example Gone with the wind, Ben-Hur, It's a wonderfull life and some others and then there is Psycho. The mother of all horror films is still the best of them all. The first real slasher flick and shock movie to be relesed. Everything about the movie is good the story, the excellent direction, the acting and the great score. The movie should of won best picture, director for Hitchcock, acting for Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. A great film that is still great to this day."
5,His Name is Norman Bates....,Wow the classic which I love in Blu-Ray - looks great on a BIG LED HDTV with Blu-Ray - just turn down the lights and turn up the digital soundtrack and enjoy....a classic brought to digital life!!
3,School Project,this movie was for my film class and it was a great movie for it's time i had to compare it to a 1998 movie the Psycho. what a big difference. The was great for the project.
2,It's' been Colorized!,"The DVD available from NetFlix is a colorized version . . . although it is billed as ""the 1960 classic"" which, if you're a purest, is tantamount to colorizing CASABLANCA. Don't see any indication from Amazon that the version(s) they have are black and white or color. I find it difficult to believe that in his lifetime Hitchcock ever okayed that happening. If Ted Turner bought the rights and then colorized it, that is/was his prerogative; but to rent it, as NetFlix does, or sell it, as Amazon is doing, and call it the 1960 Classic is a misrepresentation IMHO."
2,Really Widescreen?,"Hitchcock's deliciously black comedy would be brilliant in any aspect ratio but let the buyer beware. It was not filmed in a widescreen format (VistaVision, Cinemascope etc.), therefore, this is just another clipped version for those 16.9 freaks. More is, in this case, less."
3,so so,"[WARNING: movies spoilers ahead] Recently I watched Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, and The Birds. Out of these four, I only liked Vertigo... the other was not much of anything new, probably due to so many other movies imitating it... but god... even if none did that, can Rear Window be so highly acclaimed as it is? It feels only like a low budget Hong Kong black and white movie made in two weeks. The plot sucked.Maybe Schizophrenia was a brand new thing in 1960 and a lot of people are surprised by it. But it isn't anymore now, so the surprise element goes away.Even some re-run of Hitchcock on the TV that is 30 minutes long have more twist and surprise and ending better than The Birds, Psycho, and Rear Window."
5,"What is that, I haven't a Clue to what that is?","This Movie I like, in my ow Opinion, I would have to say that it's filled with Adventure and Mystery, and I like that. If your like me, then I suggest that you check it out, but if your not, then I suggest that NOT watch it."
4,Stabbitty Goodness and Bagel Bites,"I enjoyed this movie. It had much stabbitty goodness... and stabbitty goodness is great... just like bagel bites, which I like, just like this movie, which is like bagel bites... mmmm...spam. The end. Of the world will soon come... or not. Just look for these signs: When you hear high, screeching violin music that means there shall soon be some stabbitty goodness. Stabbitty Goodness: when somebody is stabbed and continually stabbed even when their bloody corpse falls to the ground... this relates to the movie... which I love... mmmm... spam. Now I know that this isn't gonna get posted, if it does, I'll laugh and laugh, and laugh some more till my head falls off, and somehow it continues to laugh. Which is like the movie, which I love."
5,Great movie,"After a while you ask yourself how it started, you have no idea what's next, and you have no idea how is going to finish... you will not get bored."
2,Hard to follow but easier to swallow,"A devious office girl checks into a hidden motel after ripping a superior off of a large sum of money and deciding to return it, gets murdered instead. After a string of disappearences, some snoopy relatives find the motel. Usually one-glanced as an untouchable classic, some may see otherwise. The pace is too slow and the murder scenes aren't convincing enough. Also contains no suspence whatsoever. Black and white is good for this movie which the old timers will enjoy."
3,PsYcHo,"I think this movie is the funniest movie ever. I saw it with my friend and her dad told us not 2 watch it cuz we would be really scared but we watched it anyway and it was so funni. It is not one bit scary, now if u want a scary movie get friday the 13th now that is an awsum movie."
1,Best Horror Film? Not even!,"I can't believe I wasted $2.99 to rent this movie on here. People are always raving to me about how awesome Psycho is, so I finally after years of hearing about it decided to watch it. And I have to say that this is a TERRIBLE movie. You say that this started the genre for Horror films? I say there's no way, maybe some of the 70's movies [and well 80's of course!] but this is in no way a 'Horror' movie. Its not scary, its not violent, its BLAH. I understand that its an old movie, and back then there was only so much you could do because of the technologically [and the fact Hitchcock didn't have much money to make this movie] but I think it could've been better then it was. I just have to say, for a movie that so many people rave about I'm pretty disappointed with it."
1,NOT the scariest movie ever made.,"I had expected a really good movie from Psycho because I had heard so much good things about it. I didn't ghet what I wanted, because this film is just terrible. The way the camera was shot was stupid cupid, the director could of done soo much better, the acting was terrible, the music gave me a headache and the screenplay and special effects were silly and made the film boring to look at.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), criminal on the run has just been stabbed and killed by a mysterious person at the Bates Motel. Now all her friends and family are looking for her, if only they didn't, they have got a terrible case of 'mother' on their hands.I do not recommend this film at all, it is no true classic, and NOT the scariest movie ever made.Also, the shower scene is absolute rubbish. And that is definitely NOT the most well-known and best scene in movie history."
1,NOT a great classic,This movie was so un-scary that the only reason it is a 'horror' film is the dishonor it gave to the name Hitchcock. All the 'shower scene' did for me was give me a roaring migrane with all that squalking and squeaking.
1,It would almost be funny if it weren't so dull.,"The only admittance I can muster for this video is that it was probably influential in its day. However, all the praise heaped on Psycho is basically garnered from that and has very little to go on, in reality. Nowadays, this movie looks incredibly homemade and, at times boring, especially during the parts where it is obvious Hitchcock is trying to build ""tension."" Plus, it's in black-and-white, which makes a movie look old right away. When Hitchcock tries to bring in the ""psychological"" element to the movie, it looks even worse, because it is dreadfully apparent that he has no idea what he's talking about. Thankfully, someone decided to remake this movie, but that wasn't very astonishing either, since everyone already knows from this movie what the story will be. Save your money and go to the theater to see any horror movie you want--it's guaranteed to be more believable than this one."
5,Classic,What cant one say about this movie.All the cast was brilliant.The shower scene is one of the most famous in history.Good example for a charecter study movie
4,Psycho,"Psycho is a love it or hate it movie. For some the psychological elements may be hard to grasp. It is not the type of movie that will cause you to jump out of your heart, but keeps you curious about what Norman is thinking about. Worth watching at least once."
3,Not too scary!,"People, I know its hard to believe, but it wasn't that amazing. The guy isn't a part of her life. He just shows up when she's taking a shower and starts knifing away. And the way the arm moves- it looks like one of those moving cardboard cut- outs that wave ""hi"" when you pass a cheesy restaurant in the middle of nowhere. I know some people think I must be a complete moron to say all of this, but that's your problem, an I'm entitled to my own opinion, anyway. Right after I saw the movie, I just took a SHOWER- no, I wasn't scared of my own bathroom- and went to bed."
4,Rented from Amazon Prime,"Rented this movie from Amazon Prime.Streaming was smooth and in high quality. no issues.alfred hitchcock's classic, liked the movie."
5,One of the best films ever. period.,"This is without a doubt Hitchcock's best and is incredible in every way. There is brilliant acting from Mr.Anthony Perkins as well as Janet Leigh. This was a groundbreaking film that changed the face of movies forever. Although it's old, the story is one the really caputres you and sends a few chills down your spine. and who could forget the famous s hower sequence! supposedly, after the movie came out, there was a 40% drop in shower curtain sales. You know a movie is good when it affects sales!"
5,Great!!!,"This is the best PSYCHO there is. Yes, some parts may be boring or dull but some parts were pure great. Those of you who like the new modern horror films like Halloween H20 would hate this movie."
5,I haven't showered with my eyes closed since 1967!,"This is one of those movies that becomes a legend...generations of moviegoers have been showering with as little eye-shuttage as possible since its first showing! Excellent, excellent scary movie!"
3,PSYCHO Blu Ray Great Picture Qualiity but Not So Great Sound Quality,"I would definitely recommend buying the Blue Ray Edition vs. DVD. The picture quality is terrific. However, though the voice track is fine, the viewer should be prepared for some disappointment when listening to the musical portions of the film especially, the opening Bernard Herrman film score. This famous opening sequence has very little bass and is lacking in brilliance and depth.With the incredible technology we have today to enhance sound, I would have thought Universal would have spent more resources on improving the sound quality of this film."
5,run and hide!,"This movie was so scary that even a horrormovie buff like me couldn't watch some of it.My friends warned me but I didn't think itwould be that scary.At some parts I wantedto literally run and hide!I recommend this movie to ANY horror moviebuff.But one word of advice,..... don't watch it alone!"
5,One of the best and ripped off horror films....,This fine film is proof that the horror genere can make an intelligent and thought provoking film.This film is a MUST see for anyone who considers themselves a horror fan and to see a film that relies on plot and a good sense of its audience rather than cop-out CGI effects and a lame story.
5,Possibly the best horror movie of all time.,"I'm sorry but i don't see how anyone can give this a bad review. It is a piece of genius. The story the acting everything. You have to give it a chance, and if your not easily scared don't think it will scare the pance off you. AND SEE THIS BEFOR THE REMAKE"
5,A masterpiece of film entertainment !,"I've watched this movie countles times and it still has that undescribeable sense of, well you simply can't describe it. But I disagree that this is a horror movie, its a thriller that simply contains a few horrific scenes. It should never have been remade or sequeled, I'm sure Hitchcock meant that deadly smile of Bates's to be the end and for the rest to be left to your immagination. I've read the novel and found it lacked the tension and sheer suspense of the film. I could go on about this film forever, I won't."
5,The mother (father???) of modern horror.,"Who hasn't seen this?Raise your hands and hang your heads in shame.One of the most important films in history, you must see this.Too bad the remake is just an unnecessary insult.The original has withstood the test of time easily.Brilliant acting, brilliant pacing, amazing directing, and an ending that still blows people away.Do I recommend this movie?This movie is REQUIRED VIEWING BY ALL!!!"
5,One of Hitchcock's greatest films,From the first time you see the original Psycho. You want to see over and over again. This master of filmaking will be enjoyed for generations of filmwatcher forever. A must see for student filmmakers.
5,Shook the world in 1962,"You have to be of a certain age to remember that this film was supposed to premiere on network television in 1963. That premiere was withdrawn, however, after the relative of an elected official was kidnapped right before the film was supposed to air.This should tell you a lot about the era and intelligence about mental illness that existed when this film came out. Everyone thought anyone that was mentally ill was going to run around killing people. That is exactly what happened in the movie. Today, we know better, I hope.Still, if you've never seen it, buy, rent or tune into Turner Classic Films the next time this film airs for a wallop you'll never forget. The mental illness storyline is hackneyed and out of date by new millennium standards, but this remains Hitchcock's greatest psychological masterpiece."
5,Classic,"It is a classic movie. Makes you wonder about big kitchen knives. LOLI have a knife in kitchen looks just like the shower scene. When I am chopping vegetables, I think of the Bates Motel."
3,Great movie and for the most part nice transfer (Blu-Ray),"I was excited when the 50th anniversary edition in Blu-Ray arrived in the mail. Maybe it's just my disc, but there seemed to be a persistent, arched-vertical shadow on the right side of the picture. It was in every seen, and I haven't put my older DVD in the player yet to see I never noticed it before. Strange. I would have made it 5 stars, but knocked off two because of the shadow. Once I saw it, it was hard to ignore it."
3,This movie's okay,"Evil office girl steals a bunch of money and tries to flea the scene only to end up getting killed by a guy with a family problem: he dresses up like his mom and kills people. Very fun but a little boring at times. Gotta love that theme song. Popcorn, Pepsi and Pizza"
3,"Alittle rusty, but somewhat good...","I guess over time, some of these movies lose there original taste. This movie is ok, the plot was very good. However, I never really got scared with the shower scene. I wasn't even born when this movie came out. I'm sure back in those days, this was a real scary movie. I purchased Psycho II, haven't seen it yet, but when I do, hopfully the color added will emerse you more into the movie. They say this is still the scaries movie out there even today. I will say this, yes its the grandaddy of all horror films, but sadly not the scariest anymore. There's movie that have came out from the last decade that are way scarier than this. It's worth added to your dvd collection though."
3,Very overrated. Can't understand the fame.,"This is an old flick, nothing more. It's not scary, it's not well written (dialog is ridiculous). It's predictable. Three stars -- charitably. In general, I've no clue why people so breathlessly speak of Hitchcock. Watched like three movies of his, and all of them were worn-out old crap full of funny-acting, ugly and miscast actors speaking with fake accents, hole-ridden plots with unlikely twists, etc. -- typical old stuff. Maybe these flicks were striking back then, but now it's hard to understand why. OK, there's some interesting (for the times) cinematography there, so OK, one positive.The disk is typical Criterion: very clean visuals, subtitles, lots of extras (which would be interesting if you gave a hoot about the movie itself, but you probably won't).I can't recommend this to anyone, except perhaps to a film student learning the history of cinema."
2,Disappointing,"I always here good things about ""Psycho"", but when I saw it I was less than impressed. The screeching music gets old, FAST, and it is so slow moving that it is amazing to think anyone would (could) stay awake until the infamous ""shower scene"" (not scary at all, by the way). After the ""shower scene"" the film goes steadily downhill and ends too abruptly. Very overrated, and not recommended. The extra star is for Anthony Perkins' performance."
2,Vastly Overrated...,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film, Psycho, is about a woman who gets killed at a hick motel in the middle of nowhere. That's about it. I don't see how this film is scary... it's in stark black & white and the ""thrills"" are few and far between. Simply put, Psycho is boring, and everyone knows that William Friedkin's 1973 masterpiece, 'The Exorcist' deserved the top spot on AFI's 100 Years 100 Thrills. Psycho is an overrated movie, but then again, all of Hitchcock's movies are overrated..."
4,A Must Have For The HotWheels Collector,"Photos galore throughout the book. Great guide for any collector. Easy to look up most cars. Pricing could be more acurate though. The history and intro to each new model year is a bit short, but none-the-less this book is the best I've seen on HotWheels."
2,Great Pictures and Indexing! Some poor pricing!,"As mentioned before, the pictures and index system is great. The pricing however, is set so that the editor/writer can sell his surplus at a great profit, and pick up cars he is in need of, at a low price."
1,"Lacks in Hot Wheels history , not all HW products listed",The history section is rather limited on a year by year basis. The Hot Wheels products released through the years are not all present. Pretty pictrues though if that is what you are intersted in. It is uncertain what the prices are based on since production numbers on the individual cars are not released by the author.
2,"Great for photos, LOUSY for Pricing info !!","I must agree with one of the other reviewers here, that this book is really a sham for collector pricing info...even to establish a baseline. The photos are good, and certainly helpful to those entering the hobby, but I was very disappointed with this edition. The author is out to make a buck (or more), but has failed to deliver the book that I was expecting. Forget about the pricing, and enjoy the pictures........."
2,Big Disappointment - Expected More for a third edition,"Strauss really had a great opportunity to ensure himself as THE sources for Hot Wheels information, and he blew it. Errors from previous editions were not fixed, information was withheld, and updates were not provided. Once this was the BIBLE of Hot Wheels collecting, now it's merely a book with decent (and old) pictures."
2,Error ridden and full of incomplete information,"This ""Price Guide"" contains fictious pricing, confusing errors, including errors that have been repeated from previous editions. The only positive comment I have for this book is that it has lots of nice pictures."
1,Piece of escrement!,Please improve this guide or retire and let someone else take over so we can have a complete Hot Wheels book rather than pretty pictures without any substance
5,Great Trance Import,"I originally came across this series when I bought the third volume last year. Because it's an import and I couldn't listen to samples of the tracks, I really didn't know what to expect. I was really impressed with the tracks and the mixing, some of which I never heard that were really good. My only complaint was that the second cd was not mixed at all, but this is only a minor thing.So, when I had seen that a 4th volume had been released, I didn't even hesitate to buy it. It's mixed by the same dj (Steve L) and once again the track selection is great. For anybody that enjoys great trance, I highly recommend this album. You won't be disappointed, I know I'm not."
2,not sure what to do with it!,"I registered for a Boppy because it seems as though they're everywhere and on every ""must have"" list for nursing moms. However, 8 weeks after the birth of my son, I'm still not sure what to do with it. The only real use I've found is to prop him up by sitting him in the center. It's totally useless for nursing. I'm a relatively slender and tall woman and it doesn't fit around me at all - not even close! It's not wide enough to go around my waist and it leaves a big gap that he falls into. The only thing I use it for when nursing is an elbow prop when I'm holding him, but a $5 throw pillow would work just fine for that.I think the Bobby is very over-rated!"
5,Best book on Practical Fiber Optics,This is one of the best books I have ever read on Fiber Optic communications. Very up-to-date and in-depth. It is a definite book for your fiber optics books library.
5,Sends shivers through your spine,"Baayo is by far Baaba Maal's most incredible work. He is truly in his element in this album, expressing his griot upbringing and traditional roots. While some of his other albums venture on pop, Baayo is traditional Senegalese music in the purest sense. His voice will give you chills, and his harmonies with Mansour Seck are spectacular. I have a large collection of African c.d.s, yet I keep coming back to this one. And if you have the chance to see him live in concert, as I have many times, I promise you a breathtaking experience you won't forget."
4,Callan fourth series - then and now,"Callan conveys a realistic atmosphere of espionage, especially during the cold war. More recent, technically sophisticated productions full of electronic gadgets and smart talk (e.g. NCIS) do not match it for realism. Callan has less display of violence than in current productions, but the violence, or threat of it, in Callan is more chilling. It is regrettable that the early series (in black and white) is no longer available"
2,"Learn Chinese, then practice with this program","Had I known then what I know now, I would have never bought this, at least not now.The software is in phoenetic mandarin (pinyin) which isn't helpful in understanding what you are saying. Unless you have a basic understanding of chinese you will learn chinese with no context and therefore not be able to use a word of it (or sentence of it -- we don't know what we're learning, so how can we use it?). My son and I are learning it together and though he's a stud at it, even he can't figure out the meaning of what we are saying.A big disappoint given the hefty price. I thought Rosetta Stone's expertise would deliver a useful product, but alas, the beautiful diction of the speakers is about the only upside....."
5,"Nurches of America, Chursing Homes of the United States","What a wonderful idea! Those of us with aged parents know how often loneliness is mentioned as a component of their lives. L.Ray Flowers and Lil and friends come up with an idea to cure that loneliness-unite the churches and nursing homes-think globally, act locally.Edgerton has created a group of old people with spunk and humor and love of life. He has given Lil's nephew, Carl, the patience and kindness to truly spend real time with his aunt and her friends. The description of Carl bringing his Aunt back from ""jail in South Carolina"" should be read by everyone who is called upon to care for an elderly person. It is a model of humor, creativeness and love."
1,"Love Cyde Edgerton, But - Hated This Book !","I have every Edgerton book and each is a delicious little gem to be enjoyed over and over - except ""Lunch at the Piccadilly."" I was shocked and disappointed with this book as I found it meanders at an incredible slow and directionless pace. Reminds me of an assignment I had in a college writing class to write a descriptive paper about watching someone eat a sandwich. It might be a good writing exercise, but to the reader, it's pretty dang boring. In fact, I found ""Lunch at the Piccadilly"" so boring I quit reading two thirds of the way into the book. Life is too short to read boring books! I highly recommend Edgerton's other books, but this one is not worth the time or money. Sorry, Clyde."
3,a nice story,"Well... it was okay. It was a real *nice* story, and made me want to do what the protagonist did, which is go hang out in a nursing home, and only partly because of the good karma :)The characters were interesting and I would have liked to learn more about *most* of them... but I often got confused about who was who. There could have been more detail.There were some minor conflicts, which IMO didn't get resolved, and if this book is character- rather than plot-driven, the characters should really have been explored in more depth.It made me laugh, but really didn't make me think."
3,A mixed bag,"Carl Turnage's lot in life seems to be caring for the old people in his family. His Aunt Lil is the only one alive from his mother's generation and now he is tending to her while she's in a nursing home, trying to recover from a fall. The home is inhabited by a bunch of quirky people, including a foul-mouthed old lady with a glass eye and a preacher who wishes to turn churches into nursing homes (nurches). Some of the book is hilarious, such as a joyride that Aunt Lil takes, and some of it is achingly sad. The ending kind of fizzled for me, and left me with an empty, unsatisfied feeling."
2,Elderly aunt and her nephew.,Gentle story of folks in a nursing home. Single man visits his aunt--last member of his family. Old preacher gives him a guitar and they write songs together.
2,I wanted to like it...,"this book had all the right ingredients, including quirky characters, some sense joy, some real sadness, compassion and human-ness. And a damn good idea. But it just didn't speak to me, and I couldn't get past page 99."
1,Lunch At the Piccadilly,"I absolutely hated this book. This is my first experience with this author and I thought this book was a bunch of nonsense. I usually have a 50 page rule when reading a book and I did manage to read up to page 66, but from what I read, it was silly, and just plain dumb. I wouldn't waste my time with this one as there too many other books I would rather be reading."
3,What's the point?,"It's not that the matches were bad,most of them were'nt. It's just that the matches on this dvd can also found on thier own PPV DVDS. To be fair,the matches are pretty good. My advice: If you want to see certain matches,buy this but if you want them with the whole PPV,buy the real PPV DVDs. I give this dvd a 6.4 out of 10."
3,I have a question....,I order ever wwe and tna ppv all year long so this set is worthless to me...at least i think....my question is...what are the special features on this dvd and is this set worth forking over 30 bucks just for the special features?
1,LOUSY A-1 COURIER SERVICE,"TERRRIBLE, TERRRIBLE AND EVEN MORE TERRIBLE THIS PACKAGE WAS SIMPLY DROPPED AT FRONT DOORSTEP AND I NEVER RECEIVED IT AND THAT DOES NOT SAY MUCH FOR A-1 COURIER SERVICE . IT JUST SIMPLY STINKS. I WILL NEVER USED THIS SERVICE EVER AGAIN. BELIEVE YOU ME. THANKS AGAIN FOR THE LOUSY SERVICE."
3,Darcy's Wildlife CD,This item was just as it was described although the case was cracked. I would talk to the seller about potential broken things in shipping before ordering.
1,bad,"Nothing worth buying.Sarah Paxton is a very unconvincing actress and a plain singer - another duff, another ashlee."
3,"Out of date, but still useful","This book was a best-seller when it was first published because it was almost the only one source that could help amateurs to unveil the hidden misteries of ephemerides computing.The book was written before the era of the personal computer, when a common person only had access to those luxurious HP or TI programmable calculators, and therefore you cannot expect to get highly accurate results from it because its algorithms were designed to run on those quite limited machines.You could find this book's algorithms useful if you want a fast calculation and you don't need high precision."
2,Critical,"I was disppointed; the book was in perfect state, but...- The translation was, to say the least, pedestrian; but that's a detail.- The book is, admittedly, full of useful information, but very badly organized:- The angles are expressed, once in degrees, one in hours, once in radians, and sometimes in fractions of a circle, which is rather complicated for users;- I have found a number of errors in the applications, and some in the formulae; Mr Meeus, whom I deeply respect, is certainly not responsible for this;- The book would benefit from some proof of the trigonometry formulae, and mainly for clear drawings showing which angle is which; I have had to take recourse to my old astronomy lessons (sixty-seven years ago, thank you) to work them out.To conclude: good, but not for the general public! University degree required1!"
4,"Excellent Material, But.............","The Coreys have enormous understanding of group processes and the book contains a lot of very valuable material. BUT, the Coreys also use about three times as many words as necessary to make each point. They repeat the same ideas over and over again, making the book very tedious to read. It is valuable reading, however, if you can suffer through all the verbiage."
5,another wonderful continuation,"Melissa Wiley does an excellent job of describing the world from the point of view of a 10 year old facing life in Scotland several generations ago. A lively and entertaining story, very well done!"
4,Little House Book,"Good book, I have many books of Little House on the Prairie, all about real life during the 1800s."
3,Not as good as the 1st three!,"Beyond the heather hills, wasnt as good as the first 3, mosty the story is in her sisters house and the setting never really goes anywhere else until the end of the book, when she sees her mother again. towards the middle comes a sad part, but at the end comes a very happy part (*hint*, martha's mom becomes a grandmother) It was actually Quite boring to me!! (and I really like the martha years!!) Advice: Read all the Martha & Charlotte years to fully understand Laura's years!!Hope this was good advice!!! :)"
4,Easy and Heartwarming,"In this first of the Cedar Cove series, easy-to-ready author Debbie Macomber introduces the reader to a Pacific Northwest town that sounds just about perfect. Cedar Cove, Washington, is a quirky blend of old-time Main Street and 21-st century real-life modern problems, in a combination that makes ""16 Lighthouse Road"" impossible to put down.In this book, we meet family court judge Olivia -- whose unexpected ruling in the divorce trial of young navy couple Cecilia and Ian draws the reader right into the heart of the town. Then there is Olivia's irrascible mother Charlotte, who likes to sit in the courtroom and knit, and Olivia's dear friend Grace, whose husband is acting extremely strangely.Just put up your feet, make a cup of tea, and try not to wish that real life had such easy solutions. This is just a delightful treat, nothing more, nothing less, just perfect."
5,Christmas Gift,"This book is the beginning of a series that I am Christmas gifting to my aunt, an avid reader. It arrived promptly and in excellent condition."
3,16 Lighthouse Road,"This is what I would call an easy read, somewhat of a fluff novel. The story was cute, if predictable, but nothing that compels you to think about it later. If you want something to take your mind off everyday chatter, read this book. But I would just rate it as OK."
4,16 lighthouse toad,"Very good read for older, mature readers. A. Lot of truth in it.secrets, love,caring for others though not family important."
4,16 Lighthouse Road,Very intriquing setting. Great story. Characters were highly developed. Would make a wonderful movie. Lots of emotion but not melodramatic. Great dialogue but not too much. Wonderful book. Highly reccomended.
5,16 Lighthouse Road,"The book was great and a can't put down, you just want to move on the the next book."
5,16 Lighthouse Road,Debbie Macomber is one of my favorite writers. I have never read any of her books that I did not enjoy! Easy reading and she always has a thread running thru to make you feel good when you have finished the book.
4,lighthouse road,love all of debbie's books that i have readthe stories of families and you don't want to putthe book down once you have started it
5,Very Entertaining,Fun book to read. Kept you wanting to read until you finished. Can't wait to read another one of her books.
5,16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove Novels),It was a wonderful story and like how she has created a series and each book tells a little more about the people of Cedar Cove. The next book continues on with the town people but it does not leave out the people from the last book. Great reading!
3,Is This The First of a New Series?,"Debbie Macomber is a good writer and I've read quite a few of her books. This one has way too many characters to keep track of. Although I didn't dislike this book, I finished it feeling vaguely unsatisfied. It seemed like there were many loose ends to be tied up. From reading the other reviews, I am not alone in my opinion."
2,Sub-par read,"16 Lighthouse Road starts slow, jumps around a lot and there are too many characters introduced, setting up the rest of the series. I 'abandoned ship' on this book towards the end when there was an explosion on the aircraft carrier - the same thing happened in Macomber's 'Navy Wife' book. I probably won't finish this series because Grace and Dan weren't interesting enough to make me want to find out where he went anyway."
1,Disappointing,"After reading ""Twenty Wishes,"" I was very much looking forward to another pleasant book in ""Lighthouse."" It reads very much like the script from a soap opera, and I knew from the first 20 pages what the outcome would be. Disappointing."
4,Enjoyed for First Time,Went back to start from beginning and was not disappointed. I've ready many Macomber books and this met the same great standards.
3,Pleasant contemporary novel,"I was going to say romance but there isn't really a lot of romance in this book. No passionate scenes, hardly more than a bit of chaste kissing. Oh, well.The book revolves around the lives of five women who are related, one only tangentially, to each other and who each face crises related to a love relationship. The characters are well written and the plots evolve to logical, predictable conclusions. There is nothing unique or memorable about them.If you are looking for a light read for when you are sitting in the doctor's waiting room or on the train commuting to work, this book is a good choice. If you want excitement, characters you are passionate about and a story where you can't wait to see what happens next, this isn't it."
5,Great read,"This is a delightful story, very engaging. It doesn't take long to feel like these characters are your own acquaintences. Am looking forward to future books in the Cedar Cove series."
1,Don't waste your money,"I won't reiterate the plot line, but this book was a real disappointment. I love Debbie's books, but the romance here was non-existent, the characters were unlikeable, and the ending left real dissatisfaction. There was too much focus on too many characters--I ended up not caring about any of them. Read her earlier books instead."
1,What a Dissapointment !!!,"I usually am a big fan of Debbie Macomber books, But this book was sad. There were too many characters and they were so poorly developed that you could care less what happened to them.I had this book on reserve for a couple of months and couldnt wait to read it, but when I finally got it, I could barely finish it. Dont waste your money!!!"
3,OK,"I thought it was good and enjoyed it, although I don't think it was very well written. Probably too many sub stories running at once."
4,Lighthouse Road,I thoroughtly enjoyed the book. Characters were all very interesting. I would have liked to know what happened to Grace's husband. The author kind of lets you know but not definitely.
4,Pleasant read,"16 Lighthouse Road was a very pleasant read. Nothing complicated or terribly mysterious,, but a fine way to spend an afternoon in the sun."
2,Characters,Didn't like this book...too many characters to follow. It took half the book to remember who was who. I won't be reading the rest of this series. Just too complicated.
2,Does not click into place,"It splits the phone line like it should. But it will not click into place, so it's easy to slide it out without pressing the release prong. That makes it easy to bump so that it loses connection."
3,Low quality,"This is very delicate and would not stand up to much abuse. Do not use this near a high traffic area in your home. The first time something bumps it, it will crack."
1,"Don't even think about buying it, looking to get refund!","this product is a total disappointment, not even worth waiting time, and its terrible, the middle port did not work at all and all the ports does not support DSL! very bad product! i would give it 0 stars but i can't"
4,Very useful,Great beginner french book. It actually has more information and guidelines than I anticipated. Came in very handy while in Paris.
4,not crl but decent quality,lock was prime line brand not crl but decent quality. lock set was very tight. poor construction but some graphite and working lock open and closed solved the problem. all metal construction other than handle and left and right compatible. be sure to turn lock set upside down if using in left side configuration.
5,"A magic, beautiful, sad but wonderful love story","This is not one of these soppy novels, I have read it a hundred times and still get real emotion every time. The hero ""BOY"" is seen though the eyes of 3 persons around him, his 12 year old niece, his lover -maid of the house- and also the old servant of the family. The story takes place in the 30's in a rich family in South West France, I'm living there and really am imbued with that wonderful atmosphere when I read it. Its one of the 3 books I'd take with me on a desert island. If someone reads this comment, then gets the book, I'd be happy to get feedback. I'd love to get an english copy to present to ""someone special""..."
4,Great Compilation,Excellent collection of writings by some of the most amazing self help experts in the world. Well written compilation of imformation and wisdom that will help you to live a life you only imagined.Recommended.
5,Best book ever,"This is by far the best and most lovely Henry James book I have ever read. Please don't be suprised if by the end of this book, you start reading another. There is something rather mystifing about Henry James' writing that puts the reader on edge yearning for more."
1,Disney has some problems,"After installing this software, an error occured. After about 2 hours of searching Disney's website for some answers, the best they could come up with was ""return it for a refund"". Apparently, this software doesn't work with certain sound cards and video cards. The website of course couldn't tell you which ones. What major disappointment. My children were so excited to make Mickey and I had to explain to them that there was no way to make it work. Thanks for nothing Disney."
1,not the best for the money,"Like many of the previous reviewers, this software is interesting but not worth the money. After playing with it for alittle while, you'll want to move on. I accidentally bought it thinking it was Magic Artist Classic or Magic Artist Studio (which I still plan to get). Like someone else wrote, wait until they come out with a future version (#2 or #3...)."
1,Disney 3D Magic Artist isn't all it's Cracked up to be,"When you are in the store and you see this software... IGNORE IT! It is so limited. The box says you can draw a 3D object, but that object turns out to be a wall about one inch thick. Also, it does not allow you to layer the things you draw. The only semi-cool thing you can do is create a mickey mouse that has no eyes or fingers. This product is really for kids at the age of six or below. So if you go out thinking that you are getting a good deal for 3D animation/drawing tools, you are way off. All in all, on a scale from one to five, I give it a negative five, but that was not a choice in the ratings so I had to pick one. So in conclusion, IT STINKS LIKE ROTTON EGGS!"
1,Breast Cancer: Daughters Tell Their Stories,This was not what I was expecting. I had hoped that it would tell me what the girls themselves thought throughout the process - it seemed to be much more statistical.
5,Love it!,"I have never cared much for putting on makeup...it's a pain in the patootie, but I *love* Bare Minerals!"
3,"I wanted to love it, but it made my skin flake","I loved the results of all the BM products. I thought that they made me look great. After 3-4 weeks of using it every day my skin started to flake, especially where I apply blusher and bronzer. It seems that they produced an inflammatory reaction on skin that became mildly infected with a yeast. It is not a big blemish and I loved the product results, but beware if you have sensitive skin or irritation prone skin or if your skin ever gets flaky patches. I can't use the blusher or bronzer and I have to be very selective about where I apply foundation. I never use the mineral veil because it seemed to make the flaking worse or cause breakouts."
5,Well worth it,"This blush has a beautiful rich color. Unlike other powder blushes, it doesn't fly around in a cloud around your face when you put it on, but stays put. So very little of the product goes a long way."
5,bought as gift and it is her favorite,this is my daughter in laws favorite make up. she says it is the best she has ever used.
1,Awful for me,"I saw this in an infomercial about 2 years ago, and I was really excited. I ordered it right away. When I used this product, I got lots of pimples. It was disgusting! I tried to give this product a benefit of the doubt, and I continued using it for a month. My skin got worse! I was really disappointed. Everybody's skin is different, and I just wish it worked for me as it did for everyone else."
3,pretty color,I like this blush a lot but have found other mineral products in retail stores much cheaper that work just as well.
5,Awsome Book,"Mr. Evening does a great job of getting you into the digital world. The beginning of the book explains the color spaces and what this means in terms of what you see on your screen and what comes out on print. He then goes into Photoshop itself and teaches you everything you need to know to masterfully play with your images.A great, great buy!"
4,A must have for anyone breeding alpacas,"As an alpaca breeder for seven years, I still use this book as a reference guide and highly recommend it to folks who might be interested in breeding alpacas. It covers a wide range of topics with great illustrations and facts, from what signs of labor to look for to how to care for the newborn cria and don't forget the dam, after she delivers. Know that everything listed and described might not happen, but is a nice presentation and helpful resource to have besides your vet. If your vet is new to camelids, its a great reference source for them as well."
4,"almost perfect, except: batteries needed","the optical sensor is smooth. the software that comes along allows for programming the buttons for customized functions. left and right mouse buttons, clickable scroller, and two tiny buttons in between the left and right mouse buttons (default: back and forward on browser)after around 5 minutes of non-activity, the mouse automatically turns off. if you click on it, it turns back on. (didn't realize this at first, and i kept on pressing the reset button to sync it with the finder) that's fine once you get used to it.this mouse is almost perfect... except it runs on 2 AA batteries. the mouse cannot be manually turned off (instead, it waits for an interval of inactivity of about 5 minutes before auto-shutoff). as something of a nerd, i spend around 12+ hours on my computer on the weekdays. the batts only last about 2-3 weeks.if only it had a charger.."
3,Family Croquet,"Our family of four play LOTS of croquet during the summer and the boys are real competitive and hard on the equipment. So, sturdy mallets are IMPORTANT! This set meets that qualification; but, we were really disappointed in the quality of the wickets. Our first game and one wicket has already fallen apart!!!!"
3,Difficult to Learn,"Not sure why I need to learn the Japanese word for ""elephant"" as part of the first lesson. The language is difficult for me, and English speaker. Hope it will get better."
2,this is really so-so material,"It's really not a wonder to me why John Howard's records never ""took off"" or why the label dropped him. Both of these discs sound like an artist struggling (read: trying too hard) to make a hit pop record...kind of like when Elton lost it around Rock of The Westies - except his band had the chops to lift the sub-par songs somewhat. These are grand attempts at the piano-based, and occasionally camp, singer-songwriter (a la early Elton) genre but sadly this stuff is just plain mediochre. The lyrics are blase and at times quite honestly embarrassing (i.e. ""some good good loving""??). I tried hard to like these records but the songs are just not quite there. If you want to hear an early seventies lost jewel then turn to Bill Fay, NOT John Howard."
3,An on-point album from a pure hip-hop artist,"This was G Rap's first album, and it's good.Marly Marl's production is good, and very original. Kool G Rap rips it on several tracks, the rest a little slower. The main problem is that some of the ""slower"" tracks are too boring. ""She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not"" is an example of the type of track that fails to keep your attention. All in all, it could be better, but many of the tracks are great."
4,An album only for true hip- hop fans who appreciate the art.,"Kool G. Rap & D.J Polo are one the most under rated rap acts. Road to the Riches is a well crafted CD that captures the essence of hip-hop, compliments of super-producer Marley Marl. This CD is jammed packed with raw beats and some of the most amazing lyrics ever to be placed on wax. Check out the singles ""Men at Work"" and ""Road to the Riches."""
1,Horrible!,"This product appeared to be used, the dvd was not even properly attached to the case. I was thinking, because of the price of $40+ that it was several dvds, it was one and scratched. It was purchased as a birthday gift and very embarrassing when it was opened. I returned the item immediately."
2,Better Tutorials Available,"This tutorial was actually pretty helpful at first, but really becomes harder to work with as you move on in the lessons. Lessons 1-5 were okay, but 6 and onward are very frustrating. It would be beneficial if the book used more images of the buttons or selections. Pro Engineer Wildfire 3.0 is much better, not to mention more throrough."
1,Just a badddddd book!,"The book is just bad. I agree with most of the other reviewers. The exercises are poor, the quality of the pictures is even worst and the book is too wordy and vague. I think Roger likes to hear himself talk in a roundabout manner. This is just a bad book!!!"
2,"short, not very useful","First off, this book has about a 16 point font and is very short. It looks like my 6th grade book reports where I was trying to fill as many pages as possible. The author is a weight-lifter first and foremost and doesn't seem to have any particular insight into running. He just lists basic exercises and training programs.The programs are very specific, and there is little advice on how you would tailor your own if you don't plan on lifting weights according to his strict schedule.Skip this book, get a good book on basic strength training instead."
2,Disappointed,"Found this book to be disappointing. There was quite a bit of content on how to perform different exercises, but it was lacking in running specific information. It did not go into depth on how each of the specific exercises helps running performance, nor did it provide a variety of alternative workouts to achieve different goals. I should have been more careful before ordering this book - had I seen that it was one in a series of ""Ultimate Weight Training"" books for different sports - not written by someone who specializes in running - I would not have bought it."
1,Disappointed!,"I was disappointed in this book. I was hoping to find out more on the difference in weight training between distance runners/sprinters. There was very little useful information on this topic. I know these drills, weights, but as a distance coach, this didn't help at all. It made me think of how to train my pole vaulters/long jumpers a little more, but no distinction is made for sprinters, middle distance, or long distance. That's what I was hoping for when I bought this book."
3,another mediocre volume,"What we have here is another mediocre volume in what should be a great series. And this year's looked promising, but you'll find very few poems worth noting inside."
3,torah codes 2000,A book of instructions do not come with it and it is hard to get a translation. It has many steps to work out.
5,Fantastic book,"If you are looking for nude photos of typical people -- look elsewhere. The book is filled with beautiful people, with a few rare exceptions. Many photos are of bodies sculpted in unnatural poses. Large full page photos and nicely bound - a nice production and a model for other books. One of my favorites."
5,comment by author,"This is not a review, but a comment by the author, Terri de la Pena. I just logged on to see if a synopsis existed for my forthcoming novel ""Faults,"" (Alyson, 1999) and was surprised to see that ""Latin Satins"" is still evoking comments five years after its publication. No, it was never intended to be a young adult novel. Much to my surprise, the New York Public Library listed the book on its recommended list for young adults, which caused me a certain amount of pride and consternation. I certainly do not relish being the target of readers who think I would direct my fiction to young readers. And I'm not a beginning writer, either. Have been writing since I was 13 and am now 52! Hope y'all will like my new book . . . ."
2,Hard to understand,"I realize this is supposed to be written by the mind of an 18yr old boy off at war. He is totally away from everything he is familar with, as were all those young men who went to war. But, it is very difficult to read due to the grammar and spelling. I am assuming this is a self published book, with little or no editing. Even so, that does not take away the power of the trials these young men endured.Being a Viet-Nam vet, I can relate to a certain degree. I commend this Author.I thank you for your Service."
4,First hand story from a young man who was there,"Nice memoir from a young tin can sailor. If you want the real story, you're always better off to go to the guys who were there."
5,A great book to read.,My Dad was at Okinawa. He was a corpsman in the marines. This book fulfilled my interest to learn more about my Dads service.
4,Great...,"My dad' s ship,the Guam was in the same group as the author's ship and was mentioned a few times.. I felt as though I was seeing the war as my dad did. I enjoyed reading it very much."
3,Facts and Time Line,"If you are looking for a book relating the detailed events of this man's part in the war, you will not find it here. He very carefully recounts the dates, places and actions taken by the Destroyer he served on and his part in it. He rarely reveals his reaction to events, and there is no detail about the many engagements with the enemy and rescue missions he participated in. Just facts and nothing more. But I still thank him for his service, his bravery and the role he played, which was significant, as was the role every soldier and sailor played."
3,Go to War as a Boy,Intimate first hand look at a young man in the Navy in WWII. The publisher would have done well to get a spell-checker-to the point that the TYPO's kept jerking me away from the storyline. But it is a very intimate view from a deckplate sailor's point of view.
4,A sailors story,This is a great story that puts you in the life of a sailor during those trying times of World War 2.
4,Poor editing,"While this was a most interesting first hand story, the editing was poor with misspelled words, etc. With a little cleaning up it would deserve 5 stars."
2,"This Could Have Been a Good Read, But....","The author tells us he wound up in the navy shortly after finishing high school. He apparently didn't pay much attention in his English classes. This book reads like an eighth-grade paper on ""What I Did Last Summer.""As another reviewer has commented, the only moving part of the book is the epilogue. Surely this book was never confronted by a proofreader or an editor. In addition to many factual errors, there are misspellings galore, such as Mt. Suribachi spelled two different ways, neither of them correct. Still, for the price (especially since it was free as a Prime member), it was worth the couple of hours it took to wade through it."
3,"Pretty good story, easy reading.","I read it in one night. Too many words required. What do you mean ""required""? I am doing this as a favor to you."
3,Not really that good,This string is very inexpensive and does provide some spin. The thing is that after a couple of hours it will either brake or lose tension in such a way you will not have any control anymore. And I am not even a big hitter!
4,Historical fiction for kids,"In the late 19th century, the Bromfield-Browns move from England to Riverside, California, for their father's health. A black sheep relative of theirs also lives there, and his wife is prominent in local social life. The Bromfield-Browns must mend the rift between the families in order to be socially accepted in Riverside.Meanwhile, they deal with the orange grove they have bought, especially with trying to prevent the oranges from freezing. They also must deal with their rowdy neighbors.The book is good fun and features a strong heroine."
4,Solid and enjoyable movie,"Oddly on my tivo this was only rated 2 stars. You can see the reviews here consider it much better than that. Seems to be a pretty good blend of a period piece, scifi, and monster, should appeal to a wide range of audiences. Though like a lot of these ""blended"" movies the ""hard"" scifi is minimal the actors will get you hooked."
5,Outlander,A great science fiction movie. The scenes are great and the acting is also great. This is a keeper and highly recommended.
4,Outlander [Blu-ray],Very entertaining movie that was sent as a new Blu-ray covered in plastic just as if I were to buy it new in the store.
4,"Not exactly 4 stars, but close enough","I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if it was an option. This was a good movie; entertaining. Way too violent for my usual tastes, however. Some scenes were just over the top violent. The acting was good. Overall, a good sci-fi movie, definitely reminiscent of Aliens, Predator, etc."
3,Outlander,Recieved immediately and in excellent packaging. Not my kind of movie. Bought it because we like Jim Caviezel knowing we might not enjoy it. Was interesting enough to keep us watching to the end. Probably well done if your like this kind of movie. If sci-fi is your interest you will probably like it.
3,The definition of average.,I'll keep this short. The acting is pretty bad. The predictability of the storyline is horribly high. There are some CGI effects and scenes (mostly involving the creature in the movie) that help save this from being a flop but not enough to make it worth buying on Blu-Ray. The trailer made me think it was a good buy but it really isn't. Buy the streaming version before you decide to drop coin on this flick.If you still want the blu-ray let me know and I'll mail it to you.
2,Serviceable,"If you're looking for a movie with a great premise but so-do execution this is the one for you. I tolerated it and found it watchable because the lead actor gives a decent performance and I like the era. However the person(s) in charge of historical accuracy and costumes should be fired. Everything looked like Xena Warrior Princess and the ""Vikings"" didn't act like Vikings at all, be it their customs, their dress or their symbology. The script was half assed and the direction/cinematography was crap."
3,Curious,"For me, the most interesting aspect of this film is the sympathy I had and kept for the ""beast""- for reasons I won't go into here. Not sure it was intended on the filmmakers' part (I admit not doing research to see...), but there it is. Closer to Grendel than I expected."
4,Its Good,"I liked it! Good actors, good action, not mushy but just enough to make you wonder, good special effects, and different... and hey landing in a planet earth the Iron age, it could happen and why not!"
4,Outlander,Sci-fi adventure where the future revisits and tries to create a Viking Saga. Seven more words needed to complete task.
2,Co-Stars try to carry the movie.,"The plot line on this is plain silly and predicatable from the trailer from beginning to end. However, I did watch the whole thing. Some of the lesser character actors were enjoyable and gave a kind of humor to the story that made the interplay between characters ""fun"". In retrospect, the plot was distracting and the characters were fun, but couldn't carry the film for the whole movie.One last note. I usually enjoy Caviezel but not this time. The movie took itself too seriously. It would of been better with a ""Conan the Barbarian"" feel and have more fun with the plot."
3,So-so,"Some good action in this film, but the content was a bit beneath the acting caliber of Caveziel.At least the film had a specific ending."
4,Silly yet Satisfying,"My friends and I rented this thinking it was going to be one of those terribly done films you typically see on the sci fi channel. Once we started watching the film however our expectations were cast aside as we quickly discovered that there was a lot of effort put into this film. If you can get over the fact that there are alien races out there that are for all intensive purposes ""human"" this is a really fun film. I wouldn't spend a lot of money buying it but if I saw it for under ten bucks I figure it would justify the buy.My verdict is that this is great for a group of guys looking for a fun popcorn movie."
4,Great to see a movie come from nowhere to amazon TOP movies!,"I watched this a couple of weeks ago, and said to myself ""wow...a great flick"". I'm glad to see it's now one of the best rated movies to rent on Amazon. It deserves it. If you're looking for avant garde genre-breaking plot, this isn't your ticket. If you're looking for a classic mix of sci-fi/fantasy with great presentation and overall entertainment level of ""10"", this is the spot."
4,Criminally Overlooked...,"OUTLANDER is one of those movies I'd never heard of. It's a sci-fi / fantasy / monster movie loaded w/ sword-clanking battle-action and heroics. Jim Caviezel (Unknown) plays Kainan, an extraterrestrial who crash-lands on earth during the iron age. He finds himself in the middle of a war between two viking tribes. This is the least of his (or anyone else's) worries, as a seemingly unstoppable beast has also arrived, and is wiping out entire villages. Kainan must unite the vikings in order to destroy the cunning, insatiable creature. The fact that so few people have seen OUTLANDER is a mystery and a crime! John Hurt (Alien, 1984, Hellboy) and Sophia Miles (Underworld) co-star, along w/ Ron Perlman (Alien Resurrection, The Last Winter, Hellboy 1 and 2) as a warhammer-wielding, viking warrior! Buy immediately..."
4,Loved it not just because I gravitate towards Vikings.,"This movie was interesting, and captivating. Mostly because of its viking appeal, which I love. But I have loved other movies with Sophia, and James (Kainan) reminds me of a man I know and love. The plot mixes sci-fi with historic romance. If you're looking for another Beowulf, this isn't it. You can nit pick all you want about the historic inaccuracies, but understand that the movie is for entertainment.I loved how there are easy tie ins regarding Annunaki, reptilians, and humans, as well as the quest for more 'land'. (That will most likely go over everyone else's head).I can see why it wasn't much of a big hit, it seems like an EXTREMELY good Sy-Fy channel movie (though its not since their brand movies are always laughable and the acting sucks). Thats why I didn't give it 5 stars. It isn't a Braveheart, closer to a 13th Warrior type flick. So if you liked that, you'll enjoy this one."
5,Worth your time.,Very good storyline wish more movies were this good but they are far and few. So do not pass this one up.
5,A great Sci-fi flick : ),"I'm a huge Person of Interest fan so since there are no more new episodes I thought I'd watch some movies with James Caviezel in them. Outlander was on the list and after reading many reviews I decided to rent it and although I'm not totally huge on Sci-fi flicks other than Star Wars and a few others I really liked it. There was quite a bit of blood and practically very small amounts of swearing which proves you don't need large amount of profanity to make a movie. It was VERY entertaining. I never would have expected the story line to be good if anyone explained it to me, but this is a result of great acting by the whole cast and a great story plot. Reminded me of predator, planet of the apes, and Jurassic park all wrapped into one. And James Caviezel was awesome, but I have to say he does take some odd roles in some movies. Must love the characters."
4,outlander,Love the movie very much. I've seen it ten times and enjoy it. Very well played out.The outlay was great and the main players were very good. Very pleased with this film.
4,This is one of our favorites,"My wife and I consider Outlander to be one of our favorites. We already had the DVD but got the blu-ray for the better picture. Everything about the movie is better than expected: the special effects, the acting, the story. It's a fun popcorn movie that has layers of Beowolf for those who want some literary spice. There's no nudity but there is a considerable amount of gore so keep that in mind if you have kids."
4,"Great Film, just poor publicity and marketing.","Outlander was a very enjoyable movie, with a solid cast and storyline. It was actually better than some of the Hollywood science fiction films of the last few years.I found out about this movie online, and had to wait months for it to open in my city (in very limited release!). I ended up watching it online, though I would have much preferred to watch it on the big screen.My question is: if there was a lot of interest in this movie, why was it so poorly advertised in the United States? It could have made a lot more money if it had been marketted correctly.And, the critics reviews of this film are just overly harsh and unfair! The review Amazon posts just doesn't do it justice. I suspect that a lot of the critics who write about movies here in the U.S are just paid off by Hollywood to favor some movies and slander others. Hollywood probably just doesn't like foreign competition.Buy it and watch it- you won't be dissapointed."
5,"Outlander, a solid movie","This movie should have been much bigger in the box office. It was a cool mix between Riddic and Pathfinder. If you are the type of person that enjoys action/scifi movies, then this Outlander shouldn't disappoint."
5,A++++,very cool idea and its done extremely well !!!!lots of action! cool monster ! cute chick ! good music !!must buy for me!!!!!!!!
4,Impressive Special effects + Bloody fighting scenes + Gripping Suspense = Surprisingly good,"It's an Aliens plus Vikings movie. The special effects are impressive. The dragons look life-like and vicious. The fighting scenes are bloody. For example, there's a scene where a person was beheaded by the tail of the dragon. The suspense is gripping. For example, when the dragon hunted people and ate them in the fortress at night.The background scenes are spectacular. They show gigantic mountains, and beautiful waterfall.The love story is briefly depicted but it's touching.In short, it's definitely worth watching. I own it."
3,Good science fiction entertainment,"""Outlander"" is actually an absorbing science fiction film featuring decent acting, above-average characterization, and a solid storyline. The protagonist has crash-landed on Earth, circa 790 AD in Norway, among the Vikings. He has inadvertently brought with him a member of a very dangerous dragon-like race who promptly starts killing Vikings. The protagonist is faced with the problem of being accepted among the Vikings, and also how to deal with the alien ""Morwen."" It all sounds formulaic, and it is, but actually the storyline moves along briskly. The cinematography of this film is particularly good, featuring Viking mountain and seascapes.Not at all a bad flick. Recommended. RJB."
3,Outlander,"Its a good concept of how there is always stories about Aliens landing on earth hundreds of years ago, why i find unrealistic is that this alien already knows how to fight with swords and spears but yet he is an person with extraterrestrial weapons, where did he learn how to use swords and medieval weapons, the ending was very interesting."
1,Outlander - not a movie that goes with the Outlander book series!,"I was so disappointed to get a movie that was not about the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon. It was listed along with her other excellent books and because of the name and juxaposition on Amazon, I ordered it. A disclaimer should be used if an automated system put the two identical titles together."
2,Pretty Bad,"I had expected a lot more from this movie, but it let me down. It was boring after the first 30 minutes or so.But then, that's me. I expected a lot more from Prometheus too, but it was too much like Alien(s). Cyborg. Pop out of your gut monsters."
4,A very happy surprise,"OK, I streamed this movie based on the of the good reviews it has. BOY HOWDY! were they ever correct! I can't wait to get this on Blu Ray! I'm going to buy this critter. I always have a spot on my Sci-Fi shelf for films as good as it is."
4,My 14-year old son and I enjoyed this sleeper!,"A terrific update of the Beowulf tale. Great cast (including John Hurt as a Viking Chief!), good pacing ... just a lot of fun! IMHO, there's a lot of junk coming out of Hollywood these days, and this movie (with apparently limited release) is as good as most.Recommended for when you're in the mood for an action-adventure."
2,Boring & Contrived,"A very contrived and for the most boring entry in the Beowulf rip off collection. The movie is slow paced, the acting wooden, the monster (when it is seen), average. The ""space man"" among the Vikings shtick has no purpose and is only alluded too. The plot has no twists and zero originality. Not particularly enjoyable, but not projectile vomit inducing either. Don't bother watching till on Sci Fi repeats."
1,Terrible!,"If you enjoy the SyFy Channel's 'original' movies with their third rate acting, script and plot, then you might enjoy OUTLANDER.As a long time fan of sci-fi, I can usually find some underlying qualities in a movie with that genre.Not so with OUTLANDER...it's the worst of the worst!"
5,Great movie,I love the movie if love Norse mythology and like sci fi stuff then this is a must see movie trust me you will like it. and plenty of action too.
3,Not a keeper,"I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy the movie, but I wanted to see it because James Caviezel was in it, and I was going through a phase.Not his best, you might enjoy it, if you don't mind the B grade movies, but this movie really didn't do it for me. It was okay, I won't spend the money to own it."
4,good flick,"i was surprised at this movie as it was very good.. i think it had a great story line and the plot was solid. as far as the acting goes i thought all characters did well and were portrayed accordingly. it did well in the era it was cast and,as far as i could tell,stayed true to the time line. the monster was done well and was shown enough so you could believe it was real and not penciled in after filming.. all in all i like the movie and would see the sequel if they did one[and they left it kinda open for a follow up]..."
3,5 minutes of sci-fi,"There is a space mercenary with advanced technology that gets trapped on a backwater planet.Rather than salvaging his equipment ( e.g. blaster et al ), he regresses into the Iron Age.Talk about black holes > plot"
1,Worst movie....ever,"This is one of the worst movies that i've ever seen. Seriously, could the story, acting, and cgi be any worse?"
1,Outlander,"This movie had such potential...I thought of it as more as 13th Warrior vs. Pedators then the Beowolf vs. Pedators, but it bomb right around the middle of film inserting leftist idealogly. I have had it with the left having research their ideals....can't agree. I want my money back. Seriously, there should a warning sign - ""left idealogy"" What a waste of time and money."
1,"Do people really pay to watch this crap? Oh yeah, I did.","Do you know the best thing about Wikipedia? For free you can pull up this kind of movie and read the plot in about 15 seconds for free. And there would be more entertainment value realized in that 15 seconds than in the whatever length this movie is. I don't know who in God's name is writing such favorable reviews on Amazon about this and all kinds of stuff, but for movies I am going to consult imdb.com to find out the gross from now on. Only after wasting 2 hours on this thing did I find out it grossed like $50,000. Should have been an indicator."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This is a terrible movie on nearly every level. I am so sorry for renting and wasting a precious night off watching it. The story, acting and script are ridiculous and utterly amateurish. It has a few decent special effects, but otherwise an absolute bore."
1,Awful rental!!!,"This movie is a steaming turd. It makes you wonder how much they are paying Amazon to promote this awful movie. The premise could have been good, however everything else about this movie is executed so poorly as to make this movie almost unwatchable. Rent at your own risk!!!"
4,Out of this world,"Jim Cavezil saids it all. To coin a famous phrase from one of his other movies, The Count of Monte Cristo, ""it's complicated"". This movie provides an interesting diversion for Cavezil in the realm of Norse mythology and alien invasion. It is an interesting adventure which combines action sequences and historical adaptation. All in all, it is worth seeing. The film provides the right storyline elements. Plot exposition is well done and the characters are firmly rooted in tradition and character."
5,Very good sci-fi / action movie,"This movie was very good and I am surprised that it didn't do much, much better than it did in the theaters. The writers did an excellent job adapting the classic Norse story into the science fiction / action genre and there were enough comedic and dramatic moments interspersed throughout to break up the film and prevent the action from seeming gratuitous or becoming monotonous...Overall and excellent sci-fi / action flick and certainly one worth watching..."
3,Could have been better,Hard to put in words what exactly is wrong with this movie. You sit there asking questions like - where did they get all the flamable liquid to burn the beast? why would that chic just shut up?We understand this is a movie but it would have been nice if it didnt have so may open holes.
2,I love B movies but...,"Where to begin? I love 'B' movies but this one is just too damn bad, from the poor script to the acting.The poor green screening, CGI, you name it, it was horrible."
2,Alien 3 inspired?,"I saw how many 4 and 5 star reviews this got and I decided to give it a chance. I was not impressed. It was an okay movie if you have nothing else to do and I mean literally nothing else to do. Nothing new here, in fact it really reminded me of Alien 3. I did a little research and found out that the story for this movie was written in 1992 the same year Alien 3 was released in theaters, then it all made sense to me."
2,"Outlander... This movie should be called ""Outlandish""","Okay, I watched this movie because of the reviews from other people, but I was totally disappointed. Science fiction meets The Vikings... It doesn't really mash together well. Come on, a space alien dragon named moron or something travels through space or time with this outlander guy to reek havoc on a viking community, but everyone thinks that outlander is the killer. Boring... They try to go after moron (I think that might be his name) but there ends up being two dragons, blah blah, blah,... Guys don't waste your money on this."
4,Like Sci-fi? This movie is for you.,"As usual, ignore the critics if you like good sci-fi movies. This movie was awesome! The moorwen was cool, the acting was good, the effects better than any sci-fi original. An instant cult classic ala Pitch Black.I really wish this had had better (or any) marketing and distribution during it's VERY limited theatrical run. I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen. Still, as the title states, if you like sci-fi movies, then go get this one on DVD. You won't be disappointed."
2,Bad,"The numerous positive reviews surprise me. Effects are good but acting, story and writing made wife and I exchange yawns and puzzled looks formthe duration. After watching 15 mins, we were worried we could have gotten free on Netflix, it was that bad. You can rely on reviews like we did or choose something else."
3,"It won't win any awards, but is worth watching.","On the basis that entertainment is supposed to be entertaining, I give this movie three out of five. It has a simple yet quite interesting story line, reminiscent of Beowulf. It held my attention for the two hours it runs, despite non-glorious CGI and one dimensional acting from Caviezel. Yet through those faults and one less-than-satisfactory flashback regarding Outlander's past, this movie is amusing, creative, original, and worth watching. The less you know about the movie, the better the movie will be."
5,Starman vs Dragons,"Sorry folks, this is no mythic hero slaying demonic beings. It's a soldier on his way home to bury his wife and child that ends up with a couple unexpected passengers he helped drive to the verge of extinction. His ship crashes on a backward planet their society ""seeded"" and he, along with the unexpected passengers, are the only survivors. He must then try to eliminate the two ""dragons"" before they eliminate all life in the area of his crash site. This isn't just an action tale of super-predators and human survival but a moral drama regarding the rape of worlds. Good Special effects, authentic Viking backdrop, and rich character lines make the movie enjoyable even if you miss the real lesson. If you haven't seen it, you should."
1,It's Perfumed.,"It's perfumed. Every time I mix a spoonful of this in a small bit of water to drink, it tastes like I'm eating ladies perfume! Yuk."
3,Economical Works Good,"Flat wire, made in Taiwan, White insulation with black lettering, marked for polarity, wound on plastic spools, comes with 4 solderless gold plated metal pins colored for polarity, 102 strands of 36 gauge Oxygen Free Copper. Only 49' not 50. Marked 1ft every 1ft. Markings are accurate. Simply was spooled too short. Overall rating is OK due to shortage."
3,The Pickwick Papers,Difficult to get started in. I read it anyways. Give yourself time to get into it. It is Dickens after all.
5,Classic Dickens,"Well, I bought this title for my Kindle ""Paperwhite"" and I'm glad I did. The Pickwick Papers is classic Dickens at its' very best, and now it's available at my fingertips."
2,formatting issues,"It's free - that's the major plus of this edition. As noted earlier, there are some irritating formatting issues, such as the lack of consistency in chapter headings. However, far worse is that this edition omits anything that isn't pure text, such as a key illustration and lines of song/poetry. It's still a funny book and worth a read, but keep in mind you'll be missing some jokes just because they were left out by the editor."
3,Dickens in serial form,"This probably captured people's attention when it was first published episode by episode. When read page after page after page as one generally reads a novel, Pickwick begins to pall. I quit halfway through with the intention of maybe returning to it one day."
3,The Pickwick papers,I am enjoying the series The Pickwick papers I Have not finished Reading the complete series the holidays are here I can get more reading done
4,"Sorry, have not had time yet to read.",Sorry that I can't reveiw this book yet. I have heard a lot of good comments on it and I am looking forward to reading it soon.
1,Songs are missing from the text,"For some reason, all the songs in the book are missing from this free Kindle book. In at least one case, a song was the punchline at the end of a chapter, so it is a major flaw. I solved the problem by downloading the free epub version of Pickwick Papers and converting it to Amazon's MOBI format using the free Calibre program."
3,"still working on it, easy to put down so far.",book is a little slow and hard to get into. i'm not there yet. bounces back and forth a lot
2,No maps in Kindle Penguin edition,"The book seems great, but the whole reason I ordered it was to refer to the maps and notes - plenty of notes are there, and there is an enormous legend for the map, but no actual map in the Kindle anywhere. So half of your reference material just isn't there if that's what you got it for, as, 150 years after being published, that's most of what distinguishes a new edition like this. I emailed the publisher, but two weeks later they still see no need to get back to me, so consider this a defective edition."
5,Marvelous portraits,"The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens ostensibly follows the exploits of a ""scientific club"" headed by Mr. Pickwick, a retired businessman of financial means. But as Dickens notes in his preface, the club is a mere point- of- departure for a rollicking story, and is soon left behind. This is a wonderful book, notwithstanding a few tedious spots, and some ""sidebar"" tales that could have been left out. Dickens' true genius lies in his portraits of the two Wellers- Sam and his father- who gradually assume main character status. Rembrandt himself could not have depicted them with more insight. His sketches of these two are so lively, and so full of good- natured humor, that they will live in your memory for years to come."
5,A matchmaker's dream come true,If you don't believe a great book can have a happy ending this book will change your mind. One of my favorites.
4,Pickwick Papers,"When I want reading entertainment that I can put down to get some work done, this is the book I return to. It takes a little adjustment to get into the rhythm of the old style, flowery, language, but it is humorous and relaxing. It is a series, so just when I think I'm near to the end, a new section appears. :-) I may never finish. LOL"
2,Confusion in a nutshell,I have read Oliver Twist and found that this book's language was much more difficult to follow. I just couldn't get into the story.
1,The Pickwick Papers,Hard to follow and didn't inspire me to read the series. Sorry I did not like this book at all.
3,"Beautifully bound, but too little to read?","This edition is just gorgeous...Hard-bound with gold edge on the pages, delightful illustrations, ribbon for a bookmark, clear crisp ink, well worth the price.The only drawback is that the book itself is TINY, only about 4 inches by 6.At 2 inches thick, that makes for an uncomfortable book to hold in the hand and read, the print is so tiny that if you are over 40 years old, you will probably find it frustrating if not impossible to read. So this is a great collectors edition but somewhat impratical. For what it is worth, The Pickwick Papers are commonly published this way, as a tiny book, so buyer beware if you are looking for a readable edition."
4,I liked it,"PP is a joy; in that it was written when CJHD was 24, it is also a wonder. I don't have much to add that has not been said. One sees the author grow as a writer as the book develops; by the end he is in top form. The plotting is thin, and the chapters episodic, while the details are vivid, and the language rich. By the end, the reader feels at home in early Victorian England. I enjoyed the spectrum of characters. The bad ones are able to be polished a little, and develop redeeming quality. The good ones sparkle, but have their shortcomings. There are also plenty in the scrum who are just ordinary, albeit singular, human beings. Recommended."
1,The Pickwick Papers,I just couldn't get into the information. I will probably be sending it back.sorry I couldn't enjoy it. Thanks anyway
2,Fair does not = Good,"I would consider this book Fair condition, not Good. I've bought other books on Amazon that I would consider in better condition than what I expected. This was in worse. There are stains on the first few pages, the cover is not terribly secure, and the book is as old as the hills. Disappointing. Glad it wasn't a gift. It did ship fast."
2,a joke,"This book is a joke .very low quality pictures.Graff should be ashamed for a book like this one.They deserve something much better,which as far as I know does'nt exist."
2,poster received damaged,The poster was delivered through the US mail. The shipping tube was bent and the poster has creases down the entire length because of it.
2,A little too old,"I viewed this DVD -- I guess when I ordered it I thought it would be a better made product. The age of the DVD did not have the impact I thought it would. It was great in it's time, but now our current population just cannot relate to it. Since I'm a Drug and Alcohol Counselor, most of the films in this DVD did not apply. I will keep looking for more up-to-date movies."
3,Could Be Better,"Gives great strategy tips on each map, but needs more info on how to operate the different vehicles. Plus changes have been made since the game's inception through the patches. Scoring, game dynamics and rankings are different now. An updated guide with better vehicle training would be great."
3,not new,"New Strategy Guides usually come sealed in a wrapper and/or with unbent pages, I ordered this new but I clearly received this as used."
1,"Own it, played 200 hours in a month, etc.","I'm a Battlefield fantico from the Wake Island Demo release some 2-3 years back, O' how time gets by you. If you don't know what I'm talking about then you are the proverbial ""noob,"" the word not uttered in good company. Now, having shamed the noobs, let me say this second edition of a great original BF1942 makes me want to re-load the original and get back to El Alamein. Rommel seems to be on the loose."
5,Great buy!,"Good quality product at an excellent price, but don't buy in the summertime as the chocolate will be melted!"
5,MUST READ for all my employees-associates!,"I first bought a copy of this book when it came out in the 80's. It's somewhat dated now (there's no references to email or the internet) but it really is my BUSINESS BIBLE! I buy used copies where ever I find them and any time I like an interviewee I give them a copy and explain the importance of reading this book before the 2nd interview. Some do, some don't...some get hired and some don't... they don't last 5 minutes into the 2nd meeting. I tell people, ""Want to know how to deal with me? Want to know what to expect from me? It's all in this tome!"" How about a re-write for the new century Harvey? Now on my 50th+ purchase."
5,I'm Getting Ready to Swim with the Sharks,"I enjoyed Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive. I am considering a career change and moving into sales, so I am ""studying"" up on techniques and processes to be effective right out of the gate. I am excited about the Mackay 66 and know that it can make a huge difference.The tape is easy to listen to and covers very useful concise points on beginning to develop relationships.I will listen to more of his tapes and can't wait for my book to get here."
4,Shark Repellant,"Mackay's book is a must read for anyone in the sales profession--especially if you're selling a commodity product. He outlines many straightforward methods to differentiate yourself from your competition. Pretty much common sense and blocking and tackling, but sometimes the obvious is the most overlooked."
1,Nuts!,A bunch of feel-good stories about the author. The only real meat is his list of questions about his/your customers. The substance of the book is: find out all you can about you customers AND find out how they fit in and see the companies they represent.The only good news is the book has so little substance it took me only an hour to read it.
5,Lots of helpful hints...,"A book filled with many tips on how to run a business and how to be a successful manager. Lots of stories, good advice on how to better your leadership skills in business or in personal life. Fast read and entertaining."
5,thanks...,"Thanks a lot... very Happy... on time, and everythin OK.... Thanks a lot... very Happy... on time, and everythin OK...."
4,Still relevant after all these years.,Short but chocked full of great information. I have listened to it a few times and gained new insights each time.
5,Tipton,"Does very good , would be nice if it was a little bit heavier but that can be easily resolved. Super buy for the money!!!!"
4,Holds my long guns fine,"This isn't the perfect professional solution, but for my small collection it seems to hold everything just fine for normal cleaning. My Mosin, SKS, and various pellet/BB guns all fit good (all with standard style stocks). My AR, with pistol grip, works but the fit is not ideal."
4,Tipton Gun Vise,"The construction of this vise is pretty good, not the best but does work well for holding rifles to clean and mount scopes etc. But when you try and use something like an AR it's not so good but price was reasonable and for general use it works well. The vise is a bit touchy to get tight with the cam action feature of the clamp but useable. Wouldn't recommend for gunsmithing jobs but general cleaning it's a good buy."
5,great book,"everything was great, the book is wonderful!even my teenage daughter read it and loved it!"
2,no justice,this remix for the 90's does no justice for these songs. in my opinion the ninety's was the worst decade for music anyhow and the remix of these classic songs fell right into that trap. there is 2 songs on the cd that i might play but out side of that (there is nothing here)i know this was'nt a big seller
4,Two early Miles sessions.,"Miles had his first session ever recorded on this LP. It is not too good, as Miles hardly plays, although good playing from Herbie Fields, the leader, and funny singing from Rubberlegs Williams make this a good session. The other session was Miles' first as a leader, and it is awesome. Miles plays great and Charlie Parker and John Lewis give good contributions. These sets are worth getting because of the rare chances to hear Miles's first sessions."
3,get the bar instead,I think the Lava bar works a lot better than the liquid for cleaning really dirty hands. Takes quite a bit of this stuff to clean your hands as most of it will run off right away. Ok for the light stuff though.
4,Still Not the Old Lava,"I have searched all over for the older style Lava that is heavy on the pumice, which really gets the tough grime out of your skin after working on machinery all day.This is not it. There is much less pumice and a lot more ""moistrizers.""That said, this is still a lot better than GoJo and other porducts sold in Home Depot, Mennard's, Lowes. Even the auto parts shops no longer carry the right stuff."
5,Lava Heavy-Duty Hand Cleaner,Product arrived as described and in a timely manner. Very pleased. Thank you.
2,Lava Soap Hand Pump,"I don't know if the problem was the faulty engineering of the hand pump bottle, or the packaging by the sender, but the pump handle is supposed to lock down when in a non-use mode and prevent soap from coming out. When I opened the package, one of the pump handles was not locked and the inside of the package was a gooey mess and half the product was gone from the bottle. I tried the lock-down on the handle and it wouldn't lock, so I think the problem is the manufacturer's, In shipping, the bumping around had managed to pump out half the contents. When ordering, be sure to tell this supplier that they must tape the handle down or something to prevent this. I sent the product back."
3,A GREAT BOOK,"THIS IS A WONDERFULLY WRITTEN BOOK, NO MORE THAN A BOOK. FOR THOSE OF US WHO FEEL IT MORESO IN OUR BLOOD, EVEN IN OUR DREAMS. THIS BOOK HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE PAST, AND THE TRUTH OF WHO WE REALLY ARE. IT SPEAKS OF AN AMERICA WE CAN ONLY DREAM OF AND AS ONE SIDED A CONQUEST AS THEIR EVER COULD BE. ITS SPEAKS OF THE CONQUERORS NOT AS WHITE MEN, BUT AS MEN AFFECTED AND AFFLICTED BY THE SICKNESS OF GREED AND HOW THEY SHAPED THE WORLD, WHETHER SPANISH, DUTCH, FRENCH, ENGLISH, OR EVEN PORTUGUESE. WHITE WAS NOT THE ISSUE BUT THE REALITY. THOSE THAT CAME AND CONQUERED DIDNT HAVE NAMES, DIDNT HAVE A CARE, AND THEIR ONLY COLOR WAS GREED. THIS BOOK HELPS SOME, AS IT HELPED ME, SEE THROUGH THE FOG OF TIME AND REMEMBER THAT WHICH ONCE WAS. THIS BOOK HELPED ME UNDERSTAND A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION, WHY? , IT IS A BOOK I WONT SOON FORGET. AND TO ALL THE OTHER YOUTH MISGUIDED, AS A SUN WITHOUT A FATHER, READ THIS BOOK AND REMEMBER, READ THIS BOOK AND DREAM."
5,Outstanding book,"An outstanding book on contemporary Japanese environmental politics. The author brings a deep knowledge of Japanese society and politics, as well as substantial field research experience, to this important work."
3,"good camcorder, poor warranty","This is a nice digital camcorder for making home videos. I give it three stars instead of five mainly because the warranty is only 90 days for labor. They won't tell you that until you have a problem. In my case, the viewfinder started to appear washed out after about 4 months. When I called Sony, I was told that I had to pay ~$... to have it fixed. I decided not to fix it and use the LCD panel instead. A minor problem is that the still picture quality is poor, much worse than a typical 1 megapixel digital camera."
4,Excellent value,"I've used the DCR-TRV27 for almost a year and a half now. Excellent image quality, light weight, great battery life, data flows through FireWire to computer very well.Down sides: Sony's web site doesn't even acknowledge they ever made this camera; searching on its model number will not produce any results. So if you lost the manual, the best source to get it in .pdf form is Amazon! Also, the zoom is a little over-sensitive.These are minor quibbles though. For the money, this camera is a bargain."
5,Great overall,This is a great camera and buy. the quality is exceptional and with a one hundred dollar external mic it has superior performance. It has dv in and out and av in out and still picture is very nice. i do not owne this product but use it almost every day in my video production class
3,Not satisfactory,"I bought this camcorder 11 months ago. Used it 7-8 times. Now the tape is getting stuck. It is difficult to get through with Sony customer support and when I get in, they said parts are under warranty , but labour is not. It costs usd 220 to repair it. Picture under low light is not good."
4,Little Giant,"After reading many reviews and shoping at several stores, I took home my new Sony Handycam. ( DCR-TRV27 )Don't let the compact size of this little giant fool you!The power and fetures found in the TRV27 are many you might pay more money for in other cameras. The image quality was great!I used it to record live music with very nice sound & video.Low light video was brighter than stills in same light.I found the controls laid out well and easy to use.The manual that came with it was good for basic operation, but when geting onto some of the advanced operations it was some times confusing. My bigest dislike about the camera is loading tapes is done from the bottom of the camera. If you have it mouted on a tripod, you must remove it for tape loading. Overal I love the camera and would recomend it to anyone."
3,And ?,"I don't know. some people reviewed it highly. I don't see any special about this camcorder. It has megapixel, but it's for photo. I didn't buy it for camera, but for camcorder. Picture was clear in close range, but about 10 feet away, objects are kind of blurry. And I couln't focus on it any noticeably.I bought it for trip, recording scenery, which it doesn't do very good job.If you want camera + camcorder, It will do a trick.But if you have already camera, I would go for better camcorder."
2,U pay more for less u get,"The product works pretty good. When video or images are to be recorded on to the mini DV tape, this product works as good as any of its kind.By the word hype I mean that:1) The memory stick part of this product is a eye catcher. I bet most of u would be tempted to buy this product looking at this feature. ""The quality of the images stored in this memory stick are substandard.""2) The video or images when downloaded on to a computer will have aweful quality.3) The memory sticks are very expensive. Eg: 128 Mb ...can accomodate around 22 mins of video. A mini DV ...can accomodate 90 mins of recording.Bottomline: This product - Memory stick = will be atleast ...less that what u pay for this product. .. can be a pretty decent digital camera."
2,At Least This One was (Maybe) Honest,"This is a good read, a good read about a master forger and a man who refuses to repent. A sociopath in action. Mr Irving claims this book is honest, the truth, but since he is writing about a giant lie, it's hard to believe this is as honest as he would have us believe. If you are are interested in the mind of a sick man, then this book is for you."
5,"Very, Very Entertaining!!","This book is so enjoyable to read! Clifford Irving narrates this story in sequential order and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out what happens! His writing style is very good and I enjoyed every minute of this book. I felt I knew every one of the characters and I felt for them, too! I was amazed at how easily he fooled so many people. It all started out so simple but then got out of control. I wondered and still wonder if it was really Howard Hughes at the press conference. He should have been forced to show himself to prove he was really still living. I can't believe that it took so long to make this great story into a movie. You can't make stuff like this up! I haven't seen the movie. Irving says it is nothing like the book, so I'll probably catch it on free TV some day. If you want to read an entertaining book, read this one! You won't want to put it down!"
4,"COOL, DRAMATIC, ROMANTIC, ACTION PACKED!","I usually don't go for western movies but the ACTORS/ACTRESSES were SO good. The Jessee James story was told way better than I ever heard! It is an exciting movie, susspenseful. Has a great ending too, which I wasn't expecting! Oh and ladies....COLIN FARRELL will make you ""melt""!!! He's so incredibly HOTT & talented!!! ;) BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! You won't regret it. Guys will like it too. It's a cool movie! :)"
4,Very good,"American Outlaws may not be the greatest movie ever, but it sure beats most of what Hollywood is putting out today. With up and coming stars and a storyline that keeps you watching, you can't help but wonder what will happen next. If the actors seem a bit young, there could be good reason for it. The James/Younger gang was young. I love a good Eastwood western as much as anyone, but he is getting too old for those kind of movies. All in all, this is one of the best westerns in a VERY long time. I highly recomend it."
4,"Great Movie, great service","Purchased this DVD through Amazon because I was having trouble finding it in big box stores (I guess it's too old). The product arrived in brand new condtion, still in the plastic and it's great! I didn't have any problems with the seller or the condition of the disk."
1,AWFUL!,"I have read a great deal about the James/Younger gang, and have seen a number of films about them. Not only is this the worst western I've ever seen, it's one of the two worst movies I've ever seen, period, in my 47 years alive on this earth. Don't waste your time! Read one of Marley Brant's books about them or watch The Long Riders instead."
5,Colin Farell: An Innocent Jesse James,"In American Outlaws, Colin Farell stars as an innocent Jesse James. He manages to maintain his innocence through an entirely fictionlized account of the James-Younger gang exploits in the Wild West."
3,"Oh paleeeeeze, young guns was already done...","I don't mean to side-saddle this one to the curb, and have to give it 3 stars 'cause I never made a better movie myself, but let it be said....In case you've forgotten, Young Guns has come and gone with great results! Tombstone rocked! Classic Eastwood spaghetti westerns (though old) kicked butt! and I could go on and on , but the point is ~ real cowboys were not cute wisecracking joking kiddies////// This is yet another ""oh here's the hype- how much did it make on the first weekend- run of the mill - wow that's the chick from that other movie- oh, the teenieboppers think he's cute- disappointment"" It is for this reason videostores now have ""In stock guarantee or you get it free"" , because it will remain on the shelf , except for suckers like me who have a compulsion to see almost every new release and most of the old ones. C'mon~ try that old previewed copy of Young Guns again and prove me wrong."
3,Shameless yet entertaining glorification of outlaws.,"If you want an absolute shameless glorification of Jesse James, his brother and associates with some great action sequences thrown in then this is for you. To me it's a bit silly and is pretty 'hollywooded' up but it is entertaining for what it is. The music is really awful in a couple spots but overall it has a pretty good soundtrack. If you just want to dismiss reality and watch some shooting and explosions for awhile then this is it ;)"
1,"""how to take an exciteing story about the west and ruin it ""","that should be the name of this fiction told as fact. the history in the movie couldn't be more wrong and why do you need to jazz up a story that has enough real action,so that it plays like a watered down third grade play. the leads and the cast try but this is one that never had a chance."
3,All in a days work,"I've watched western ever since I was a little girl. This one is one of the better ones that I have seen. I'm not real big on rating the looks of actors and/or actresses, but the the characters where excellent in the movie. The history of Jesse, Frank, and Jim were accurate. This is a movie that I would recommend to those who like westerns and like a little laugh."
3,Jessie James Movie - American Outlaw,My family and I saw the American Outlaw movie last night and it was very enjoyable ! Hollywood needs to make more westerns !
3,"Light escapist fun, don't take it to be historical fact","I've seen it and I don't think this movie is nearly as bad as some reviewers would have you to believe it is. You have to remember to take it as entertainment, not as education, and not expect it to be perfect. Tombstone and Young Guns were possibly prettier and more accurate as to location (Young Guns was at least partially filmed in New Mexico, the state where Billy the Kid did operate, while American Outlaws, set mostly in Missouri, was filmed in Texas)but this movie is not really too bad. It stretches history to the breaking point in several places and has characters doing things the real persons likely never did but it is obviously meant to be for fun, and the younger viewing market. Unlike some I do not happen to think that John Wayne was so great, Clint Eastwood was better, these younger guys do just fine and as for historical accuracy I believe American Outlaws is as good as most westerns in about every way."
4,Let's face it...it ain't Tombstone and it doesn't try to be,"I really enjoyed it. One could argue that it was because I'm sixteen and I enjoy eye candy when I see it (hello Will McCormack, Colin Farell and Scott Caan!). It's a good flick for if you want a couple of laughs...some action and you want two hours for yourself. It's good for the general audience it's trying to reach but let's face it. It's not Tombstone, so don't try to stack it up against it. It doesn't work."
2,if you like westerns....,"well i just saw american outlaws and let me tell you. i wish i had my $5.50 back in my wallet. if you like westerns, go rent tombstone. tombstone is by far a much better movie than american outlaws. this movie is good if youre looking to hate something. well that about does it. see tombstone instead, its cheaper and a better film."
1,BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN,"This movie is the one that should'nt have been made. No it's not historically accurate, But that's not the big problem(I liked the ""Young Guns"" movies)The problem with this move is it's just a really bad movie I could'nt even bare to watch the whole thing it truely sucked!!"
1,"To Cameron Krummer from Riverton, UT","Fool, the gatling gun WAS used during the civil war. Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler purchased twelve for 1000 dollars each and used them successly on the Petersburg front in 1864. Is that the only ""inaccuracy"" you could think of?"
1,A waste of money,"If only -0 were an option, what a way to waste a Blockbuster gift card. If you want historical INACCURACY this is a movie for you and if you just want plain incompetent movie making, then you'll have the twice the fun.Farrell is too clean cut to be considered seriously at an outlaw and this movie won't help his career any. The only saving grace is Timothy Dalton and a cameo of Kathy Bates. Oh and I guess I didn't really have to pay for this stinker. Thank goodness."
4,American Outlaws,"American Outlaws is as much a traditional Western as A Knight's Tale is a traditional sports film. The two have much in common with one another given their irreverent, don't-care approach to the material, and both have one common ingredient to spare - FUN.American Outlaws centers around the exploits of Jesse James, but don't expect much in the way of historical accuracy. For any who even TRY to bash the film for its faults in this category, the movie simply laughs and shakes its head knowingly. It's hard to criticize a movie that revels in its own goofiness. That's exactly what makes American Outlaws so entertaining - not to mention some fancy, eye-dazzling gunfights and a charismatic team of young actors.If American Outlaws fails on any level, it seems to come to an end far too quickly. It's a short film, point of fact, and it almost feels like you've just seen a trailer as opposed to the feature itself. But it's a darn fine trailer, well worth the price of admission."
3,Wait for the video.,"I saw this movie in preview with a free pass and I'm glad that I didn't pay to see it. Although it is enjoyable and funny at times, it is a big ball of Hollywood fluff. It basically is a big glamourization of the life of Jesse James and his gang. It has beautiful people cast in the leads and fast-paced action shots to dazzle, but I couldn't help thinking through the whole movie, ""did we learn nothing from Bobby Brady on the Brady Bunch?"" I find it hard to believe that Jesse James and his gang where such a friendly, heroic group. It would be worth renting for the pure mindless entertainment of it."
1,Fictional Garbage,"While early film offerings, such as ""Jesse James,"" supported the myth, and even some solid recent films, including ""The Long Riders,"" ""The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James"" and ""The Great Northfield Raid,"" bent facts to condense the story, ""American Outlaws"" has to qualify as the biggest piece of trash ever made from the standpoint of passing itself off as a serious Western. Mostly, this garbage allowed its cast of pretty faces the opportunity to play ""cowboys"" like a group of grade-school youngsters. Being a fan of American history, the West in general and the James-Younger Gang in particular, I remember going to see this film when it came out, and the only reason I didn't walk out was to make sure it was trash from start to finish. If you are looking for a Jesse James collection, try those early films and -- by all means -- purchase ""The Assination of Jesse James"" when available."
1,Stink Bomb Alert,"While not the absolute worst Western ever made, American Outlaws is certainly a contender for any ""worst Western"" listing. No Western can be completely historically accurate, but the anachronisms and complete fantasies contained within this film guarantee it a well-deserved place in the toiletbowl of film history."
3,Good Entertainment!,"Good fictitious western entertainment but I wish if they were going to make a fictitious movie they would use fictional characters instead of historic people.They take a murderer and thief and turn him into a hero.How would people react if they made a movie about Timothy Mcveigh and made a hero of him?It would not be too cool.""The James brothers, Frank and Jesse, were Confederate guerrillas during the Civil War, during which they were accused of participating in atrocities committed against Union soldiers. After the war, as members of one gang or another, they perpetrated many bank robberies which often resulted in the murder of bank employees or bystanders. They also waylaid stagecoaches and trains."""
4,Great Movie,This is a great western and my dad loves it. Thanks so much for your help with this gift.
3,Silverado Meets the Very Young Guns,"Despite the virtual absence of any historical accuracy and a very simplistic, Disney-esque plot, I have to say that this movie entertained and amused me. I had very low expectations for it and in many ways I was not disappointed; however, it was good escapist fun with a cast of attractive young actors and light-hearted dialogue. Colin Ferrell is definitely a comer with a nice easy (and sexy) screen presence and Scott Caan and the other actors playing the gang members were interesting new faces. In addition, Timothy Dalton was his usual competently menacing self, and Kathy Bates is always good, even though here she has a very minimal part. In sum, a light-weight movie with lots of horses and action and nice-looking young folks to watch."
4,Good Movie,Ive never read anything about jesse james or the younger brothers so I have nothing to compare it to historically. I thought it was a good movie. Its funny and doesnt try to hard. Ive heard people compare it to young guns. I dont know why however since this is the better movie. I personally dont like young guns because it tries to hard and because of the annoying old man voice of Billy the kid.
5,The Best New Old West Movie,"this was a great movie. it has the best action sequences every and it leaves you feeling that tingly ambitious, get-out-and-kick...feeling that a good action movie does. a top-notch old west movie. i highly reccomend it, it is my favorite."
4,You just have to have fun while you are watching this,As long as you keep in mind that movie was DESIGNED to be funny and don't moan about things like historical contex you should have fun watching this movie. From what I have seen Colin Farrell had a fun time MAKING it (even if it didn't do that well at the box office)
1,Pathetic,Never heard of this movie? There's a reason - the few people who saw it want to forget it ever happened. The cast is pretty forgetable but that may not be their fault. No one could save this movie.It is a lousy attempt at a comedy/action movie. Pure straight to video (...) If someone gives you this video I might suggest watching it if you are unable to think of anything better to do. You would be insane to waste any money on it.
1,Why do the bad guys always shoot at the feet?,"This movie was ridiculous. Even if you go into it know that it's ridiculous, it still is ridiculous. Why do the bad guys shoot at the feet? Why does some parts of a door stop bullets (read: where Colin Farrell happens to be standing) and other parts of wood not? How can Colin Farrell ride into the middle of a battle, shoot 30 union guys before they even realize it, and then get away because the northern guys are so dumb they only aim at the ground near his feet? I guess the way this movie is, maybe Jesse James is like Achilles and has been dipped in some sort of magic pond protecting him. I never knew Jesse James was such a nice guy, either, who only robbed banks from the evil railroad company. Never knew that the railroad company hanged people who wouldn't sell them their land (when the government was really giving them land). Do yourself a big favor and stay away from this movie."
4,Mocha Cherry Bookcase,The bookcase came in the time stated. It was packaged very well. It was fairly easy to put together and looks just as the picture presented it. I am happy with my purchase.
2,Would not recommend,"Not what I expectedLike: flip top feature and the linen covering.Dislike: feels cheap, not put together well, metal edging misleading"
2,BIO-DEAD TRASHCAN FODDER,"BIO-DEAD is a real dead film, shot in an office like many of us have or do work in, some of the ""Dead"" characters who all have japanese horror shakes actually remind me of real live people who I have dealt with in offices. My opinion of ""BIO-DEAD"" is very low in fact I highly recommend filing it in file 13. Once in more than enough. Do not buy this movie, it ain't bad that would be too nice a thing to say about it."
5,AMAZING MOVIE!!!!,"This movie should get an OSCAR, i love this movie. it's scary, freaky, and cool. I love the suits in this movie. i recommend this movie to anyone. THIS IS A MUST SEE!!!!!"
4,"Painfully astute, will look for more from this series","I read this book as a precursor to reading a book on the Dutch in the same series. In order to understand how accurately the series would portray the Dutch, I read this one to see how accurately it reflected American culture and values. **Spot on!**Some people commented on it that it is overly negative--maybe that shows how accurate it is! As an American, you will find yourself reading it, possibly being offended by it (which is, after all, very American), and then, realizing how truthful it is, laughing at its witty satire. A good, quick read. Anything less than 4 stars would be ""un-American."" ;)"
5,An excellent cure for national chauvinism.,"This is the book to give to your solipsistic acquaintances who think the United States is the center of the universe. From her opening observation that Americans are like adolescents, to her analysis of American materialism and underlying insecurity and her samples of American English, the author maintains a consistent balance between humor and truth. As an American myself, I may be biased, but I found this delightful little book to be even better than the Xenophobe's Guides to the Spanish and the Australians."
2,Letdown,"This book was a major letdown compared to some other Xenophobe books I've read. The author constantly harps on typical, uninteresting stereotypes. Unfortunately, what you get is a glaringly oversimplified view of Americana and a constant taste of her sense of disdain to her subject. While I agree that many American tributes and even stereotypes should be brought up, discussed and lampooned - this work would be infinitely better if they took a chapter from the author's of the Xenophobe's Guide to the Germans (or others) where they manage to simultaneously poke fun at themselves and their fellow countrymen yet one always senses an underlying importantly pride in being German in this humour. I actually agreed with and enjoyed small portions of this book, however, in general the reader mostly walks away with a hollow interpretation of Americans molded by the author's sense of contempt and superiority to her fellow countrymen."
1,"Does a Blank Have a Mother, Too?","Fill in the blank with any animal and you could have written this book yourself. It was so repetitive, my 4 year-old son was confused as to why I bought him the book as a gift."
2,Sweet but dull,"I bought this book for my 2 year old son because I liked the illustrations and we've enjoyed so many of Eric Carle's other books. However this one seems to miss the mark. It's very repetitive and we both find it a bit boring. There are other books with pictures of lots of animals (eg ""Brown Bear Brown Bear"" or ""Dear Zoo"") that engage Ben (and me) far more."
5,"Cute, cute, cute!","Well, sure, of course a kangaroo has a mother too! Silly question, ey? Almost as silly as the questions my little girl will be asking when she is born. At least if this question comes up I will have a book to show her...a great book!"
2,Poor grammar,"Though I love the concept behind the book, there is a grammatical error on every page. The correct language should be ""just like you and I"" (have a mother). The way every page is written implies the ""you and me"" are mothers.I show my son the pictures, and describe the story in my own words, but definitely do not read this one aloud."
4,Beautiful illustrations,"We own nearly all of Eric Carle's books, and this one, though written with a sweet message (all mommies love their babies), comes across as a bit repetitive. My two year old is not captivated by the story (each page asks the same question that is answered on the next page, using different animals each time), but she loves to look at the pictures and the book has served as a great tool for teaching the names of animal babies - the last page of the book even includes the names, if you don't know them (ie, a baby horse is a foal, but what is a baby swan or kangaroo). I'd buy the book just for this information and the illustrations."
2,For very young children,"This is a very simplistic book, with virtually the same words on every page. I do not believe that an 8 year old would be interested in this book when my 2 year old barely likes it. The art work is good, but I was disappointed with it overall. It did not have anything new to offer."
5,we love this book!,"Our daughter just turned 3 and she loves this book. We found a copy of this book at the library, brought it home and she loved it. This book encourages her to use her words. She even reads it to herself in her own little language. We are defenitely ordering this book today. It is also a great book for storytime (daycare setting). Other books that are winners in our home are ""From Head to Toe"", ""Panda Bear, Panda Bear what do you see?"",""Polar Bear,Polar Bear what do you hear?"", ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear what do you see?"", ""Dream Snow"", ""The very busy spider"". What we love about these books is the way the pictures are done, words, and all the animals in them. They are put together so well for children."
2,Kind of flimsy,"Setup was not difficult, although it was a little tricky at times because the parts were marked with little stickers that mostly fell off during shipping; overall we spent about 3 hours on saturday and another 4+ hours on sunday spreading a gravel base and putting the greenhouse together. Although this tent-style greenhouse is a little cheaper than the polycarbonate models, one of the big fabric panels was ripped all the way up to the top, the whole structure was REALLY flimsy and we had no confidence it could survive our sometimes-80 mph winds. We had to send the greenhouse back because of the rip anyway, but rather than replacing the ripped panel, we replaced the greenhouse with a polycarbonate model (which we LOVE!). For the money, we would recommend this greenhouse (non-defective) for areas without serious winds."
3,first wind storm,"Get ready to visit Ace Hardware. All the parts were delivered, but they were not engineered accurately, not to the proper length. The glazing seems to reflect more light than it accepts into the greenhouse.On the positive side, the greenhouse withstood a windstorm last night, but I did add ropes and bolts to keep it from flapping excessively."
3,A wake-up call to parents and NOT regarding divorce,"This book made me feel sad for children with the kind of parents in this book. The parents were very worried about and disappointed in their child. If the child was mine, I would be really proud of him. He tried hard, he had 2 true friends, he was good with children, he was polite and respectful to his parents, he had good sense when it came to drugs/alcohol/sex, he had the courage of his convictions, he was nice to the step-siblings. The list could go on. Why he seemed a failure to them is beyond me. Rich NYC kids sound like they have way too much pressure on them, and I feel bad for them."
3,Not what I hoped for,"This book is a decent book, but it only gives a brief look at each sailing ship. There are photos of each ship, then probably between 1 and 2 paragraphs discussing each ship. I had hoped there would be a bit more meat and potatoes to this book, but from the appearance, it's all garnish..."
4,Nice,Nice book on Tall Ships . It has the Bounty in it that's why I bought it since she is now sunk in the ocean. Has a lovely selection of Tall Ships and explanations about them. Great pictures.
4,Comfy,"Wife found them to be quite comfy, far more so than the boycut versions from the same manufacturer."
5,"Dino Saluzzi, bandoneon","Dino Saluzzi is bandoneon player, as was his more famous countryman Astor Piazzolla, but Saluzzi seems more classically oriented and his music is more introspective and harmonically adventurous. Particularly toward the end of his career, Piazzolla tended to become his own cliche, recycling a lot of the same harmonies and chord progressions. Saluzzi never does this--I own four of his recordings and every one is different. His music is probably something of an acquired taste--it doesn't have Piazzolla's popular appeal and there's less of a direct connection to tango--but it's fascinating stuff and well worth more than one hearing."
1,Worst of the bunch,Brighthand website did a review of screen protectors and this product came in dead last.
4,Moz,Well it did come on time and it seems to work well for the time i used it. Have not yet given it the grind which i will when i leave for India and use it on 220V!!
3,Good Rplacement AC Power Adapter,"Works well, here's hoping it last longer than the original adapter that came with the Wii, which malfunctioned after about 6 months."
2,120V AC input only NOT 100-240V as stated,"Be aware that the adapter sold here was designed for 110V only and not the dual voltage type 100-245V as stated. For those of you planning to use the wii adapter in your country that requires 220V, be prepared to use a voltage converter if you buy this product."
3,Not so great with large screen plasma,This product works fine on our smaller television. But it causes 'static' on our large screen plasma. The static is bad enough that we simply could NOT use this power adaptor with our large Plasma. We switched back to The original Wii Power adapter that came with our Wii and that one does NOT cause any static on our large screen Plasma. Hope this helps.
3,DON'T BUY BEFORE YOU TRY THIS!!!,"It just may be that your original power supply is NOT dead!First, UNPLUG your ""dead"" power supply (from the wall outlet) and LEAVE IT UNPLUGGED for AT LEAST 30 minutes. Plug it back in - voila! Problem solved.A friend told me about this trick after talking to Nintendo tech support, and sure enough - IT WORKED!Unfortunately, I had already purchased an item like this one by the time I heard of this fix. I do not have a comment on the quality of this particular product, but thought that everyone should know of the above ""fix"". As a result, I just gave it a middle of the road 3-star rating."
1,bad adapter,When using this power adapter it makes distortion/lines go down the screen. I would not recommend this adapter. You get what you pay for.
4,works as expected!,"It's not a game it's the power adapter and it works just like I expected, arrived very quickly allowed me to put it right into use!"
2,Don't do it,This power supply is not worth getting. I noticed that it seems to lose power randomly. Sometimes you can play for days with no issue and sometimes you can play for an hour and you will get power loss 3-4 times. I would stay away from this one. I plug in my original Nintendo plug and do not have the issue at all so it is this plug.
5,great work,great service for the price payed and great timing. I would recommend this company to anyone. the product works great
3,"Price is right, works as promised","My Wii power converter died when I had a power outage, luckily the replacement (from Eforcity) was cheap. Was worried it might not be stable (the voltage/current) but works just like the factory original. Hope it lasts a few years like the original."
5,Working fine,"I bought this to replace the original power adaptor destroyed by a power/cable surge. The box part on it is much lighter than the original Nintendo power adaptor, but it's been working fine since October 2007."
5,Item came quickly and works fine,I needed a power supply for my WII.. It was reasonably priced came in a few days and works . what more can you want?
4,Functional power supply,This power adapter for the Wii works just like the original with the only difference that it fits just slightly tighter than the power supply that came packaged with the game system.
4,Thanks,"Needed a replacement for our original ac adapter. Glad it works, and hope this one lasts longer. Kids love playing their Wii"
2,Stopped working after 2 months,This wii power cord was working great initially and just after 2 months it used to turn off after 1-2 hrs of play. I am not an avid gamer and used to play just 2-3 times a month i was managing with it and now it stopped working all together. I do not get any power wot my console. I would not recommend this to anyone.
3,I've just started using it.,"It's hard to comment on an item if you haven't had it for atleast 90 days in my opinion. So for now, it's good."
4,good deal!,"A good deal and would frecomend to other buyers, although I now do most of my small electronic purchases at monoprice.com."
1,This is a live cd and not the Talisman's first studio album,Talisman's first studio album is also called Talisman and this is not it!!!!!!
2,This book should be free,"I had bought this book at Sephora and paid... retail value... thinking this book was going to show me how to apply makeup. Instead what I got was a commercial for NARS makeup. Yes this book tells you where to apply his makeup to desire a certain runway look.. that is if you buy his makeup. I was forced to go back to Sephora to see the NARS colors that I had read about, to find cheaper similar colors and textures. I feel this book should be free, because all it does is sell NARS makeup. It does not explain how to use makeup, but simply which of NARS makeup to use on the face. The pictures are great, and there are great ideas.. but it does not help anymore than looking at a magazine filled with models in ads. I would however rate this book 5 stars if it was a free guide to using NARS makeup."
3,Some good tips but not far enough in photo examples,"It was a good read on the essays and tips on different parts of the face - skin, eyes, and lips etc... However, I didn't seem to walk away with anything new as far as how to correct problem area or acne blemishes and contouring. Robert Jone's book Beauty Made Simple seems like a better choice for that matter. However, Mr. Nars has some good insight on makeup and that alone may worth the price of the book. As a photographer and want-to-be makeup artist, I want to learn all."
3,Lacking in Ethnic Diversity.,"I really must say that I LOVE the format of this book and all of the excerpts written by Franoise Nars. The make-up aficionado and novice admirer both will benefit from his ideas of beauty and the concepts behind makeup. It truly is a must have for those who simply adore make-up and furthermore adore the Nars line.My only complaint about this book is his lack of skin diversity. Most of the models used seem to be pale and freckly, not at all an accurate description of the different women there are in this world. I would have enjoyed to see models with darker skin complexions as well as different skin textures (older models, models with skin problems, etc). Hopefully his next book will play host to more of these different and diverse characteristics, thereby providing a base of enhancing beauty through make-up for people of all ages and all races."
4,Great Book!,"I thought this book is a really great way to see NARS products on actual faces. I must say after I purchased it, I really got into the NARS makeup line. It has great pictures and cool trasparent pages that show directions for applying the makeup."
4,A useful make-up guide,"The acetate overlays in this book are very helpful for make-up placement. They allow you to see the face before make-up application as well as the finished face. There are some great looks in here. They all use NARS products, and each face lists the exact make-up used. This is very beneficial, especially for those who aren't the best at chosing colors and/or textures."

2,"very basic techniques,not at all what I would expect from the creator of a great makeup line!","I read all the reviews before I bought this book and found them to be quite equally negative and positive.I should have listened to the negative ones,because I was disappointed!I was looking for some new looks and techniques and all the looks in this book are really quite basic,even if you are a beginner at applying makeup I think you could recreate most of the looks in this book.The gray on white pages was small and very hard to read as well.If you are looking for a makeup book to teach you new ways of applying makeup check out Kevyn Aucoin or Robert Jones books."
2,Not Impressed,"First of all, the introduction rubbed me the wrong way and I found it full of contradictions and a way to knock other makeup artists. He mentioned that makeup articles in ""these books"" are blatently unrealistic because of the retouching, yet I didn't see one blood vessle in the eyes in any of the pictures in this book. He also says you should ""notice the woman, not her makeup"", but isn't that hard to do when you look at a face with acid green, orange and gold eyeshadow topped off with bushy eyebrows? All of the models seem to be in the same age range and are obviously professional models. How does this benefit the reader who really needs and wants advise? Why didn't he pick people off the street to really get his point across? The pictures are large and self explanitory, but he was better off choosing a wide variety of women based on age, race etc. so everyone benefits."
3,Not For Me,"I really looked forward to seeing this book after hearing about it. It seemed like the format, with before and after pictures and plastic overlays, would be terrific for showing exactly what to do to create the looks. Unfortunately, I hadn't at all counted on the fact that I would have no interest in the looks themselves. There is a lot that is bizzare here, much that is fairly plain, and nothing that I could or would do for myself. The models are all young and gorgeous; they've no need for makeup. Certainly there are no techinques shown for improving weak features. I couldn't have been more disappointed with the book--but I have to give it three stars because it does what it does well. It's just nothing I need or can use."
1,Good for nothing,"I have already exchanged mine.Very nice quality of paper and pics, but:- it just shows very young models w/ pale pale complexions (that is, where makeup really shows easily);- it carries transparencies with the names of their colors aplied in every pic (what ridiculous propaganda!);- it is based on the fact that one simple item (like just a red lipstick, or just eyeliner or whatever) can change a whole look and that's all they show.(So far, Auckwin's have been the best I've bought, I just love both of them!)"
2,Visually appealing but not much else,"I love NARS, their products are amazing and Francois Nars is a great artist. But this book was a complete let down. This isn't your typical makeup tutorial book, it is full of head on photos. One photo is the model bare faced and the next photo is of one with the model wearing makeup. My big gripe about the book is that out of all the photos there are only 4 women of color, big disapointment.There is a thin see through microfilm sheet of paper on top to show you placement of the makeup products and their name.The makeup applications are great, no explainations on how to put it on. I wish I had realized this is a more table top book than a makeup instruction book."
1,Buy this if you have too much $$$ to spend,Simply a collection of photo shoots with runway models & NARS makeup. Should be sold only at NARS counters.
1,never recieved it.,I never revived my book. It's been 6 days since the expected due date and it hasn't arrived. I have contacted the seller but no response. And reading up on other reviews on this buyer I probably won't get my book and/or my money back. It seems to me that they only focus on the good things but when things go wrong they fail to address it and disregard it all together. That is a sign of a bad business. I won't buy from this seller again horrible service. If I would I would give it zero stars.
2,Not worth it,I found this book to be a bit of a disappointment. Whilst it had beautiful images the how-to just wasn't what I expected. Onsold it asap
4,Very interesting,"This book has a unique approach with its clear pages illustrating where the colours have been placed on the models. The make-up is very creative, and for the most part is only stuff that you'd find on the runway. This is not a book for beginners (as the majority of models are not made-up for everyday situations), but more for someone with a good base who is looking for some fresh ideas."
5,Nice Book. The Overlays are Great!,"This book is great for the beginner and the expert. I like that Mr. Nars tells you the Nars color and the general color you can use in place of a Nars product. Some people commented the looks in the book are not street ready. I think many of the looks are. Nars is giving you a guide, and you choose colors that flatter your skin tone. Some of these are looks he created for runways and advertising, but adjust them to fit yourself. I'm not crazy about the plastic cover it comes with. That cover is too flimsy when not on the book. It should have been thicker or harder to match the book. This book is great for men and women that are interested in make-up application or art."
3,baghdad cafe picture soundtrack,The music of course was excellent. the CD must have had allot of room on it. I thought it was going in circles playing over and over.
3,One Song Album....,"The only reason to buy this album is to get ""Calling You."" This music works much better in this great movie rather than a stand alone sound track."
2,Rolling system doesn't work,"I m very much used to the Space Bags for storage at home and for travelling. On my last purchase I've bought the ones with the new Rolling System. The idea sounds perfect but it just doesn't work when you are packing.Once you have your clothes inside the bag and seal it, the act of rolling it demands strenth and caution (as the plastic can easily blow). The air won't come out through the seals.At the end I cought myself leaving the bag partially open, rolling it (using my knees on the floor) and then sealing it. My wife said she wouldn't have the strenth to do it.These bags are real space savers but rolling system doesn't work."
2,"Great concept, poorly executed.","I have used this type of bag for several years, traveling nearly every week. This is the first time that I have purchased this brand and it will be the last. The first time I used one of the large bags, I sealed up some clothes for 3-4 days as a test. The bags did not leak - great news. When I opened the bag, it ripped away from the zipper. Thinking I had been too rough with it, I tried again with a second bag. Same result. The bags that I have been purchasing from Target have been holding up for 15-20 trips before losing their seal. I was hoping for at least that much durability from the Space Bag brand, but I'll have to be disappointed.The plastic feels too thin to hold up to frequent opening/closing cycles. Maybe if you are going to seal it up then put it on a shelf, these may be for you. Otherwise, save your money."
4,Gets the job done with a little practice,"I've now used these a few times while traveling. I've only used them on sweaters, since they take up the most space in my bag. Although they didn't get them as flat as the vacuum-style bags do, they definitely took up less space than if I hadn't used them. It definitely took a little practice, though. First to figure out how to effectively get the air out, and then how to do so without it sliding down to the end. I've gotten good at that first part, but am not always good at avoiding the thick lump at the end when rolling.i haven't tried this on anything but thick sweaters, since I've gotten pretty good at packing everything else efficiently. I'm pretty sure that I could have gotten my sweaters this compact by tightening the straps on the bottom of my bag and squishing them down. However, this made it really easy to take out and rearrange my belongings to maximize space. I also use packing cubes, and can fit a lot in a small bag!"
2,Fail.,"Yes they do compress, but you're better off rolling the air out of a ziploc bag, then buying this. The fabric of the items bunch up and block the opening where the air is pushed out. You can't even get the items as flat as the picture shows. I also noticed that it's difficult to even deflate the air out because the air backs up."
2,A little flimsy...,"The second bag I used ripped on the first time I sealed it. I called the company directly to ask for a replacement bag and they told me contact Amazon directly... Since I already used the other three bags in the box, not sure what Amazon will do."
4,"works as stated, but requires some effort on your part.","The space bag works as stated. I packed clothes for a 1.5 week trip to Korea, and this really helped out. Not only does it reduce the volume the clothes use in the luggage, it also keeps the clothes clean and compartmentalized. The space bag does take some effort to use since you have to roll the air out. As I rolled the clothes, the clothes typically shifted towards the end of the bag where the trapped air is expelled. This seemed to block the vent and prevented further air from being pushed out of the bag. However, I just had to jostle the bag to shift the clothes towards the other end of the bag and then continue rolling, and more air got out. Its not difficult, and much better than lugging a vacuum around. Overall very pleased."
2,Bags break pretty easy,I bought a few spacebags and they ended up breaking. One when I slid it on the tile to put it in the closet.( a pin hole. made the bag junk) One when I was pressing a blanket in the bottom... the seam broke. The others seemed to get air back in them over time in the attic. The under the bed bag works the best even though still letting air in over time. If the bags were thicker they would be better and they only work good on bulky items pillows and comforters... T-shirts and pants don't flatten at all.
1,Space bags,"I am deploying and I was looking to save as much room in my back as possible. As soon as I took these bags outside of the package I could tell they would not last. The zipper seams sturdy, but the bags themselves are made of a cheap material. Zip lock bags are sturdier. I attempted to pack my first item and the zipper got cought in the bag and immediatley tore the bag. I would not recommend them to any one.thee product information on online does include what they are made of. Samsonite has a similar product, about the same price. I would recommend them instead.ITW Space Compressible Bag BRS-9212ZG Vacuum-Seal Travel Roll Bags, Set of 4"
4,Saves space,"These are OK for packing and traveling if you are trying to fit a lot of stuff into a small suitcase. However, if you are trying to overstuff a larger bag to fly, remember that it may take up less space, but it weighs the same. The airlines charge you for over 50lbsThat being said, these work really well as long as you use them with flat, folded clothes/towels/sheets. But if you think you are going to save space by rolling a stuffed animal or something bulky, they don't really do very well."
5,Great Product,I have used this product since '06 on my 3 week backpacking trips in China each year as well on a couple of US business trips. Great to conserve space. Wouldn't pack for any trip without them.
5,A life saver!!,"This is really a fantastic product. When reading reviews it seems that it's fairly common to have bags ""break on their own"", but after using them for a solid 2 and a half weeks, I'm really not sure how that could happen. One of the 8 bags we used ripped, but that was because we snagged it on something sharp. The bags themselves really are made of great plastic, and I never once felt like I was going to break them while using them. They do exactly what they say, and we were able to fit quite a bit more in our suitcases without having to worry about that pesky weight limit airlines impose nowadays."
1,Space Bags,"A space bag is made out of the cheapest material I have ever seen. They rip so easily,let alone vacume air out of the bag.Honestly, I think this product is a waste of 13 dollars.Do not buy this product."
1,Flimsy,"Pretty flimsy. They worked for my first trip, but would not hold air the second time I used them. None of the three. Very cheaply made."
4,Terrific item!,Was able to travel with carry on only for 10 days in Costa Rica thanks to these. I gave them 4 star instead of 5 because I would have liked to have purchased only carry on size.
2,Not a True Space Bag,"I gave this two stars simply because if you read enough, you will eventually realize these are not the bags you use the vacuum seal feature with. You need to roll the air out of these bags which is a pain and is not very effective. The sizes are smaller than what they profess to be. I suggest spending a few bucks more and getting the right bags.... Most people will be dissaspointed with these...."
3,Medium carry-on fits only so much,I've only used the space bag on one trip and the medium sized bag worked well for two thin beach towels. However on the way back apparently over stuffed bag opened on its own I believe due to the pressure change on the airplane as it is practically impossible to squeeze all air out. Also the little plastic bit that you are supposed to slide to seal the bag came off but on the other hand it is easy yet a little annoying to put it back on.
5,Great space saver,Best value for your money for great product. Love using space bags becasue it gives me extra space to buy more stuff.
2,space saver luggage bags,These bags work great! They are easy to use and really do save space in the suitcase. The good part is that they can be used again for the trip home to hold the dirty clothes separate from the clean ones.
3,Not Bad,"I still prefer my adobe photo shop for business which comes with my scanner even though I have upgraded my computer and OS several time. By the way, it is definitely better than Corel's product."
2,I cannot believe this....,"This program is awful! You want a little button with an apple attached to it? Buy this... Otherwise PSP is for you. I bought this and had to return it, I've never done that before. I admit it takes time for PSP, but PhotoImpact takes time to get something that dosen't like you used the original PC to make it. DON'T BUY THIS, save your time."
5,Quick and dependable,"I started out with V4.2, so I'm pretty used to navigating through the editing process quickly. I'm much faster with it than in Photoshop, BTW. Nothing much has changed, just some improvements with the web design part of it. I use it strictly for photography. It's fast, the undo arrow is right above your work and goes back I think 6-7 steps if you don't like what you did. It's a dependable, solid program that'll still be useful in years to come. Maybe Win XP has something to do with it, but I can't complain about XP either."
5,Highly Informative,"You should be familiar with general UNIX commands and the UNIX OS. This text will take you help you take advantages of the UNIX system. A lot of complex ideas are set forth. I highly recommend reading this book in between watching ""Takin It All Off"" and ""Bikini Car Wash"" videos, both of which are available through amazon.com VHS video department. The analytical aspects of this book are both analytical and very aspecty. Two things I look for in a computer-based book. If you are having difficulty with this text, then get a beginning text on UNIX, like ""UNIX for Dummies""."
5,Great book for beginners!,"This is an excellent guitar instruction book for beginners. I had never even picked up a guitar before, but thanks to this book I am playing songs on the guitar without the expense of lessons. This book will teach you how to read notes and also where they are located on the guitar, as well as what fingers to use on the left hand. This book also teaches tabulature for those interested in that. All around, this is a fantastic guitar instruction book for beginners."
2,Flimsy plastic cracks all over,"This was the second headlamp of this type that I've had, and it suffered from the same problem as the first (by Petzl), only it didn't last as long. After about two years of use (6-7 camping/backpacking outings) the plastic started cracking pretty badly, and despite my attempts to rescue it with epoxy the thing became unusable. Very disappointing."
5,"Great product, great purchase, fast shipping! Thanks Amazon for making this happen!","Great product, great purchase, fast shipping! I'm so impressed with this Princeton product, I purchased 4 of them. Biking, nite hikes, maintenance on vehicles, and gifts to people.Thanks Amazon for making this happen!"
4,"Great lamp, versatile uses (camp, bike, flashlight)","All around - Princeton Tec makes great lamps. I've had the EOS for about a year and the tec quad for several years. The EOS has a better pivot mechanism that holds the lamp in place. The older tec quad is a bit looser where it pivots, but it is likely this has been resolved on newer models like found on this EOS. This lamp is more of a spotlight, if you need a softer more dispersed light, check out the quad."
4,"Worked great, failed, got a replacement from warranty","Had my Princeton Tec EOS headlamp troublefree for a few years. Batteries while in ""high"" mode did not last long but never ran into any trouble with that. Worked great in the Arizonian monsoons and whenever needed. Never seemed to have any moisture problems but somehow one of the spring electrical contacts in the battery compartment eroded and broke off. Called the number on my instructions/warranty paper. Princeton Tec gave me an RMA, I sent my light in they sent me a new one. Hopefully this one doesn't fail because I really like the light but in the event that it does I trust Princeton Tec will take care of me again."
1,Not as advertised,I purchased this to mount on my helmet for night biking.The light does not seem regulated... dims after 30 minutes on high with freshly charged 900 mah batteries.Does Not provide a sharp light beamCompany DOES NOT respond to my emailsDefinitely not worthwhile buying for cycling.
