5,Egyptian Towel set,Oh so soft! I love these towels! I can't believe I got them at such a great price!
2,Towel Quality,"I guess you get what you pay for. Great price, but several of the towels became ""unwoven"" on the edges the first time washed."
2,Get what you pay for,"It was a good deal at first then I washed the towel set and they shed more than any towels I ever bought. Even better, the bath towels were falling apart at the seams. I used a towel. And yes it was soft and comfy but still left me covered with towel bits. Overall poor quality and dissatisfied."
1,Disintegrates into lint and fuzz,"I was very disappointed with the feel and look of the towels out of the packaging. They appeared dingy and old. I thought, from reading the reviews, that all they needed was a wash. I was wrong. The towels started to come apart at the seams and it filled the lint trap of the dryer with the most lint I have ever seen! Since then I have used the towels and have had to be wary of lint and fuzzy on my person after showering or on fabrics that I lay the towels on. Very bad quality. Do Not Buy! I have bought egyptian cotton, soft, luxury towels at a national (blue colored emblem) department store for a great price, and these towels have surpassed even luxury hotel towels I have used!"
2,Pike Street towels,"This set of towels was not the quality that I expect from Amazon. I purchased a blue set and a brown set. For whatever reason, the brown set may have been slightly better, but that's not saying much. I washed and dried them before monogramming and already, there were spots along the towel edges that were starting to become unraveled. Since these were a gift, I reinforced the stitching with a blanket stitch along all of the towel and hand towel edges to prolong the life of the product. But this is something a buyer should not have to do with a new product.I will not purchase any other Pike Street products."
1,the worst towels ever,bad quality. I find bits and pieces everywhere. lost their color in the first time in the washing maching. Its horrible.Dont waste your money on this.
1,They don't absorb water,I have washed these a half a dozen times now and they still are lousy. They don't absorb the water off my body. I never heard of anything like this. How is it possible to have a towel that doesn't dry?Towels are useless.
2,dissapointing,"I was so surprised to find out that these towels were not very absorbent at all, especially after all the reviews. I bought hese for my son, for his apt. when I went to visit , I was quite surprised they turned out to be so nonabsorbent."
1,freys,The towels were given as a Christmas gift. I really liked them until I washed them. There was a bunch of lint in the washer and when I took them out of the dryer toe towels had strings hanging from the edges. I was really disappointed. It was that way on two of the four sets. I sent them back
1,Towels fell apart with first wash,"This is a first at Amazon. These towels are not even seconds, after the first wash they fell apart. These towels are not up to amazon's standards."
2,"Soft, Fluffy, Beautiful--BUT not very absorbent!","We have been using these towels and wash cloths for about three weeks now and even extra washings have not made the towels absorbent. Just now, while trying to dry my hair, water actually rolled down my face. They are soft, but do not take up water as I think a towel should do. The wash cloth is much the same way. And, when placed on the towel rack to dry, they take forever. In fact, when I took them out of the box, I immediately washed them, and it took forever to get them dry enough to take out of the dryer. I've never seen material like these towels. I bought three sets and can't really use them unless by some miracle they begin to absorb better."
1,Torn and tattered,"After one wash, I sent these back. They came out of the washer ripped and torn after just ONE wash! Surely NOT worth your money!"
1,First-ever water-prooof towels!,"These towels are truly amazing! In addition to being soft and coming in a large array of fashion colors, they seem to have been treated with a very effective water retardant. Marvel in wonder as they leave puddles completely undisturbed! Watch in awe as water actually beads up on the fibers! Pass them over your wet body and you would almost believe you just stepped fresh from the tub if not for the fine coat of lint covering your still-wet skin, your still-wet hair and your formerly clean bathroom floor. I highly recommend these towels as show pieces in your for-display-only bathroom or as extra padding for your garbage. Enjoy!"
2,Shred after first wash,"The first time we washed these towels, they shredded on all sides. Threads were coming off more on the sides of the towel than the ends. We also had to wash them 3 times to try to get the pilling cotton off. Even after that, the towels left lint on us after drying off for weeks. I don't recommend getting these towels."
1,Pike Street 100% Egypt. Cotton 725-gram 6pc Towel Set,"Bought set (Bluestone color) at 19.99 figured, can't be all that bad (after reading reviews.) Well, wrong again. I didn't expect a luxurious set, half-way decent would be good. Just rec'd it, washed the set by itself because experience has been that new towels usually shed & throw a lot of lint around especially the first wash. Dried it on medium so it wouldn't be shrink dried :-), pulled it out of the dryer. Lot of loose cotton on towels. Both bath towels are unraveling on one side -- selvage edge not sewn well or poor quality threads or ? Poor quality period. Too much trouble to return them, but I will not buy another product mfg by Pike Street again. I'll use the hand & wash towels. And by the way, this is my first fully negative review of any product. Buyer beware, and I will go back to my policy of not buying a product with 'bad', 'poor' or mediocre reviews."
1,I gambled and I lost,"After reading a ton of 5-star as well as 1-star reviews for these towels, I bought 2 sets (taupe & blue) when they were a Gold Box Deal for $19.99/set. I've never regretted an Amazon purchase more! I washed them the day they came in the mail (following the directions on the packaging), and they looked and felt great when they came out of the dryer. However, the taupe towels were covered in orange splotches and the blue ones in white splotches before they even went in the washer for the second time! What the heck?! As a woman I use a wide array of cleansers and lotions, but nothing was ever applied directly to the towel, and I've never had this ""staining"" problem with any of my other towels before! I am so disappointed! I'll think twice from now on before purchasing a product manufactured by Amazon."
2,towels not thick; began to shed threads at edges immediately,"These towels are not as thick as I had anticipated, and additionally, the first time I washed them, before using them, they started to shed threads at the edges! Poor quality! Do not recommend."
3,So So.....,"Love the softness and the sizes of the towels, but they are not very absorbant. I have washed them several times and have not had a problem with the colors fading."
3,Deceptive Pricing,"I find Amazon's pricing of its in house brands deceptive. These towels are fine, but aren't ever going to be $50 towels. They've never been priced at $50 so it is deceptive for Amazon to market them as 50-60% off at times. Occasionally they do go on sale below their normal price, but this doesn't justify marking these products as having a list price of $50. Amazon tends to do this with a lot of their in house brands and I find it very deceptive."
2,baseline towels,"These towels while really inexpensive are not the towels my family and I are used to. Upon opening the box, the towels were packaged nicely, but after opening one package, and opening the towels, strings were hanging from one towel and still attached to the towel. That is just poor quality, either the towel is already unraveleing or the manufacturer did not cut off any stray strings. The towel is extremely thin. My husband and I decided not to use the towels ourselves and I wanted to return them but it would have cost me $15 to return them. I did not want to pay $15 for something I do not have. We decided to give them to his brother, who is single and does not care how fluffy or thick the towels are. I would not recommend this to anyone who is used to very fluffy and well made towels."
1,towels,These towels were very cheap. Thin and not soft. I should not have bought them considering the inexpensive price. I couldn't find anything else I wanted.Thanks. M. White
3,Fluffy and soft but not absorbent,"My girlfriend and I bought these towels in bluestone along with a bunch of other bath accessories for our new apartment.We've had these towels for a week and they are very soft and have not lost any colour (as some of the other reviews claim). However, they are not very absorbent. My old towels which come from target soak up a lot more water than these do.One lady mentioned the following washing instructions for the towels:Wash in warm water without adding any fabric softener.This seems to have helped because after the second washing the towels did get more absorbent.Other reviews mention loose fibres on the towels. We did not notice any. The stitching seems to be solid as the towels remained intact in our commercial washer and dryer on a fast cycle."
2,"Quality-Poor, Value-Good",Have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the poor absorbancy of the towels. We have washed them three times and did NOT use fabric softner. We have used worse but these still feel like you're drying off with a wet rabbit.Also they are somewhat thin.They definetly are not high quality towels but they're still a pretty good deal if your expectations aren't too high.
3,Just bought these towels,"On the positive: The towels are big, soft, and fuffy and arrived in quick order even with super saver shipping. The colors are nice and true to description. I would love them except....The negative is that the towels do not seem to absorb any water...almost water resistent. After drying myself there stll was a coat of wetness on my body and the towels were wet and cold. Still usable but annoying and uncomfortable.."
2,Nice & soft but not very absorbent,"I ordered a set of these in the sage green and a set for my mom in the blue. They look nice, colors are great. Big fluffy soft towels. The bath size is very generous. They wash up nicely, don't lose much and look luxurious.The thing I don't like is these towels are not absorbent. I've washed them about six times, don't use fabric softener and they just don't wick the water off one's body the way I'd like. I even checked the tag to make sure they said ""cotton."" I can wrap one of these around wet hair after shampooing and 5 mins later, my hair is nearly as wet as when I first got out of the shower.It's gotten to the point where I am going to give these to the dogs. It's that irritating."
2,Seems come apart,Decent but qc is not good. Various minor problems with stitching. Stitch openedup had to return. Wouldn't by pike again.
1,It's like drying yourself with a plastic bag.,I wish I read the other reviews before I purchased these towels. They had a funny smell and I figured I needed to wash them anyway. When I used them for the first time. I had to get one of my older towels to dry off. It's like fluffy polyester.
3,They loose a lot of fluff...,"I bought these towels little less than a year ago, and I would say that I am half happy and half unhappy. The happy part: the towels absorbe and look good, feel floffy and soft even without using softener. The unhappy: they loose a lot of their fluff (some sort of little hair, something like dust or so), and my bathroom/wash maschine gets filled with it, and also it stucks on my body when I use them. This should not happen in truly 130$-worth sets of towels, which -keep in mind- is the original advertised value. Anyways, although I am annoyed by all that fluff coming off, I imagine that eventually the towels will stop loosing it after washing them a lot, and will be just fine..."
1,Surprisingly bad.,I noticed immediately that these towels are neither absorbent nor color-fast. I have had them for a year and the sides are shredding. I really could not have believed such a poor quality towel would be manufactured and sold by a reputable label. I have Cannon towels that I've owned for 10 years that are in better shape than these after one year of very light use. Stop looking at these and keep browsing!
1,exceptionally poor quality,I should have taken heed to the other reviewers. The towels were beautiful before I laundered them as instructed 'before first use'. I washed them a second time w/ other towels and the sides unraveled on one of the hand towels like someone made tassels on it. What a waste of money.buyer beware.
2,"Luxurious, yes. Absorbent, not so much.","I ordered two sets of these and when they arrived I followed the directions exactly as to pre-laundering them etc, etc. They are certainly good looking, thick towels. BUT, and it's a big BUT, for some reason or other the towels and washcloths have a tough time absorbing the water when towelling off...much less than a regular run-of-the-mill towel. For such thick towels I'd expect them to be far more absorbent than they are. So, bottom line, they look good, feel good, but aren't anywhere near as effective as other towels that I've used. Would I buy them again? Nope."
2,Very dissapointed,"These towels are large and very soft....good, but they have already started to deteriorate after only a few weeks. They have begun fray and they produce so much lint that I have had to discard them.....so much for bargain towels."
2,Egyptian Towels,"Disappointed in the towels as they are fraying already. However, I do like the thickness and the absorability of the towels."
4,Good deal for the price.,"I only ordered one set to see if they were any good. Everything in the set was a bit bigger than I though they would be. The hand towel itself was nearly as big as a lot of normal towels and they are soft and absorbent.I only rated them a 4 star because I don't know how long they will last. Durability is the only thing in question, otherwise nice product."
5,Consistently great quality,"Amazon, you consistently have products that make me feel like any time I order a product I can depend on it to arrive very soon & it will match or exceed the descriptions. I was sooo happy to receive & enjoy these lovely blue towels--the texture, quality, and hugability made me want to order more towel sets even though I have all that I need. Under your influence, I could become a hoarder."
3,not as thick as I thought they would be,I haven't used these yet so I don't know how well they absorb but they aren't as thick as I thought they would be.
1,Royal Heritage towels,"This is the worst set of towels ever. No absorbancy. The towel not only does not dry me when I use it, it stays very wet for days. I have tried washing them four of five times each and there is no improvement. If I could, I would return these towels."
1,Not Holding Up After a Couple of Washes,"We were confused by so many negative and positive reviews for the towels, and decided to take a gamble and ordered the cream towels. Well, the towels washed up nicely the first time and were fluffy and soft, so we thought, ""Wow great deal on nice towels!"" After a couple more washes, the towels are still fluffy and soft but the trim is apparently POORLY SEWN and coming apart on two of the large towels. So, I would recommend you LOOK ELSEWHERE for towels if you want ones that will hold up to regular use, and not just be fluffy and soft and nice to look at on a line closet shelf."
2,non-absorbent towels,"These towels are soft and fluffy, but the towels are not absorbent. Just as other reviewers have stated, the towels don't absorb water, rather the water rests on the surface of the towels."
1,Puckers and Non-absorbent. Sending them back.,"Can't believe how awful these were. I unfortunately bought several, washed them, then found out they were extremely non-bsorbent and they puckered. They looked so nice when I took them out of the box, too! I even recommended them to a friend. Fortunately I told her my experience before she unpacked hers. I sent back the ones I had not yet unpacked and she's sent hers back too. You can read similar experiences for this same product with other colors."
2,Poor Quality!,"I purchased this set in the blue color. Yes, it does come with 6 pieces-making it a full set. However, as other reviewers noted, it came with ""white"" spots all over several of the towels. Not sure what it could be! Also, one of the bath & hand towels appeared to be a different ""nap"" from the others. All in all, I regretted this purchase- especially since Amazon usually sells a good product for a good price. In this case, you could do better at a department store sale. Save your money."
1,Non absorbant,"It's like wiping off with polyester. They are indeed thick, but the water stays on the surface and feels really cold. I got some Bianca towels at the same time and they are much nicer."
1,Is this really a towel?,I wish I had read the previous review before I purchased the towel. I'm not sure this can be classified as a towel because it does not absorb water. The towel itself looks nice and feels really soft but don't count on it to dry anything.
5,Great gifts,"I've bought this Pike Egyption cotton towel sets before, very happy with the quality, color, and price. They also make great gifts for all occasions, both male and female."
1,"Very Soft, But don't absorb any water. Rub, Rub, Rub and still wet.","They feel great, but the first washing produced more than an inch of lint in the dryer vent, piles of lint I had to pick up by hand before I could even vacuum it up. No absorbency."
2,Very deceiving product!,"The towels look and feel thick, rich and fluffy. But, don't let their appearance fool you...or the positive ratings. They do not absorb the water. Instead, you dry yourself with a ""wet"" towel. The water droplets stay on the fabric, as though there is something in the dye or cotton that repels water. They are a great buy if you only intend to hang them in a spare bathroom for appearance. But, their practicality is questionable, as is their dollar value. Sorry.DMS"
1,poor quality,"When I rec'd these towels I washed them before using them, and the seaming stringed up and started coming loose. So I called amazon and they sent me a new set. They also stringed up on the first wash. These towels are fluffy but the seaming/edging makes them extremely cheap quality. A towel that rips and strings up on the edges is no good. My walmart towels are WAY better. I sent these towels back. This was a bad buy and now I have to pay to ship this poor quality crap back."
1,Rags,"As is my custom, I did a short wash of these towels as soon as they arrived. Much to my surprise they did not hold up to this first short wash. They are very poorly made. I doubt they will survive more than three washes before they become cleaning rags. In fact, I have shop rags which are of a much better quality than these towels. My advice, avoid these towels. Spend a little more money for a better quality product."
1,These are not absorbent towels,"These towels have absolutely no absorbancy. I have never had this problem before with any towel. They are beautiful looking, but are not towels! I don't know what to do with them other than throw them away as they cannot be used as 'rags' because they cannot absorb! If I could give a minus star I would have done so."
1,Bad towel set,These towels felt great when they arrived... Unfortunately that didn't last. After I washed them for the first time they completely fell apart at the seams and began to tear. I would not recommend this towel set
1,towels very light weight,I was disappointed in these towels. They are very light in weight and flimsy. I returned them after opening one package. Didn't bother to wash them. These are perhaps twice the thickness of the shop towels I buy at lowes! Very disappointing. Wouldn't have them in the house--much less in the guest bath which is where they were going! Amazon is kindly accepting the return and paying for return shipping. I'd do better at Bed Bath & Beyond for the same price.
1,egyptian lousy towels,"I am shocked of the quality of this towel.The towels do not absorb water at all they get wet and stay wet right away ,they are soft that's true but a plastic bag is also soft on your skin after a shower. I dont recomend them at all it is a scam its a waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Rockin Rick,"Its clean, Its smooth, It doesnt miss on any cylinder. This will be a good one for rainy days and tequila with the good visual effects. Kind of corny at the beginning with the MTVish space effects but it grows on you.The six songs range from surreal ambient to all out rocking. I like this band with him and have never seen him play and wear a keyboard like Edgar Winter. I guess he looks like Edgar a lot now so what the hell.I recommend, classy slick pop with keyboard playing that actually matters in that venue of music. I think I will be getting all of Ricks works now.P.S. Amamzon, I am getting mad at my Six Wives of Henry VIII not coming in the mail today as was said it would be here. I will be calling you if it doesnt come tomorrow."
1,Takes On Too Much,"I found KINGS AND QUEEN to be long and tedious. I think the film attempts to be too many things at once and its scattered focus is not as avant garde as it is irritating. It would have been a stronger film had it narrowed in on only a few core characters and become deeply introspective. Instead, the length, the melodrama and the would-be comic edge dilute the impact of the overall film even if it is riveting to hear a father posthumously tell a daughter that he couldn't love her. This is at the center of the movie, and more should have been built around this."
2,Tedious and Long,"Contrary to the adorers of this film, I find Kings and Queens to be tedious and long. There are a few redeeming moments in the movie, but they don't make up for its needless wandering and at times bizarre path. Francophiles look elsewhere."
5,Back to Basics.,"This book, drawing on current research findings and the authors' extensive clinical experience, reminds us that it's not the hottest new techniques or the therapist's theoretical orientation that makes for effective therapy. When satisfied clients are asked what made the the difference, their most frequent answer is a meaningful encounter with a caring, responsive human being whom the client felt understood his concerns and validated his strengths and resources. Many of us in the helping professsions seem to need this reminder. Phillip Ziegler, co-author of Recreating Partnership: A Solution-Oriented, Collaborative Approach to Couples Therapy."
1,Not worth the read!,"I had to buy and read this book as part of my counseling program. The book was really a waste of time. The authors basically slammed all theoretical orientations with the exception of their own, which is Solution Focused. They talk about how the relationship is the most important element of the counseling relationship, yet they really don't expand on how one would facilitate a ""good"" relationship. Don't buy or read this book unless you absolutely HAVE TO."
4,Or what managing IT used to be,"I like the book because it tells so well where the Information technology is coming from. A strong plus is the excellent collection of case studies provided. This is the best part of the book. By themselves, they are worth the purchase of the book.Part I of the book, is a review of the technology base and provides the MIS literacy required for the rest of the text. For a current practionner, it can be skipped over without missing much.Part II presents the application of IT. It covers all the bases but would benefits by an update to include the most recents developments. Particularly, the e-commerce section is too general to be very useful in this new century.Part III covers the acquisition process very well.Finally Part IV would be a good introduction to another book about strategic planning for IT.Overall a good textbook for a would be Manager in a fast moving field."
2,Not worth the money!,"No way! There is no way that this book is worth (the money)! As usual, the college textbook market continues to drastically inflate the price of textbooks. Some textbooks are useful at least as a reference...not this one. While it does contain all of the latest buzzwords, if this is what we are arming the leaders of tomorrow with...Buy it if you must for a class, however, keep your receipt and prepare to get ripped off at buyback time!"
3,"Its an IT textbook, not Gone With the Wind",It has the bits you'd expect in an IT text. Nothing dramatic and nothing missing.
3,Not worth the price,"This book was required for a class. It had good content, but clearly not worth the price."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","The idea of the game is good. After all, it was based on a number of successful games (Pictionary, Charade, etc.). However, the rigid control of the electronic ""hosts"" ruined it for us. It would have been much more fun if the instructions were simply written out, and the players control the game, as in Pictionary, Charade, etc. Here, the electronic ""hosts"" give instructions in a tiny voice that is drowned out if the players don't stop their talking and listen. And if you miss a word in the instruction (e.g., which color/player is going next), then the game is thrown off.We bought this game as a present for our father, but after we played it as a family for about 15 minutes and ran into the problems mentioned above, we decided that it's not much fun if you can't talk and laugh during a game. We decided to return it."
2,Great for Jr. High Kids,"Not what we were looking for. We wanted a party game for older 20's and thirty somethings. I would say this game would be good for Jr. High. The ""hosts"" inside the box are super annoying and cheesy. The cards were really pretty easy compared to some of the other games we played. My sister got this game as a gift, we tried it once and she decided to return it. Like I said, I can see jr. high kids maybe getting into this, but otherwise, it was pretty lame."
1,Definitely not for adults,"This game specified that it was for adults, but I think it would definitely be better for pre-teens and teenagers. We played twice and quit- it was way too simple to hold the attention of a group of adults.I bought it because I LOVE Cranium and Catch Phrase and thought it would be somewhat similar, but different with the electronic ""hosts"" telling you what to do. The electronic game piece is too much- it's just completely random and you have to listen to the same phrases (very interesting and oooh, I like this one) over and over again. It probably would have been just as effective to have dice and a timer!I'll definitely stick with Cranium!"
5,cool,"neveragain will i have to buy catch phrase,charades,& pictionary but now i have all 3in 1.This game has great humor that is appropreate for my childs school. i give it 2 thumbs up"
5,SO FUN,When my mom got me this game for X mas i LOVED this toy. This toy is wonderful and is very fun. I love games like this. This is a great family game.
1,Good idea but could not get it to work,I liked the idea of the game so I got it for Christmas. I went to play it and everything started out well. Then when it came time to put the card in it kept sayin put in a card. We put it in and then it shut off. Overall Do not buy this toy.
4,Great American Opera,"Though unfortunately little known Davis' ""X"" is a very listenable and exciting score. I was privileged to hear a concert staging of excerpts at the Chicago Humanities festival in 1992. This deserves to be back in print and, hopefully, staged again. The music is jazz-inflected and very much in the fabric of American nationalist composers such as Bernstein and Copland. Get this if you can find it and play it for others. It deserves to be heard."
5,JOB DONE EASY,THE ADHESIVE MADE ATTACHING THE DRYWALL CORNER BEAD EASY TO ATTACH. USER DOES NEED TO WATCH OVERSPRAY. USE A DISPOSABLE DROP CLOTH.
5,Classic Haggard novel!,"It is a genuine pleasure to read a book by H. Rider Haggard. Apart from the high adventure elements, romance, attention to historical details, larger than life characters, the delivery is in a stylish English, written by a master of the art.The book is written in the first person, in 'olde' Elizabethan English and one reviewer gives a poor rating because of it. I found that, whilst it takes a while to accustom oneself to the style, the story actually rings more true because of it.Enough of the story is reviewed here for me to not give more plot away, suffice to say I add my approval rating. No-one should be bored reading this tale of love, war, violence and vengeance.I loved it!"
3,The Mummy in Alaska,"Con Express is one of the better direct-to-videoDVDs i have seen in a long time. The characters arecredible, the story moves along at a good pace andthe directing was good for a movie of this type.In many ways the plot was a combination of UnderSiege 2 and Cliff Hanger. In fact, some of the thescenes of the jet crashing into the ground seem tobe directly ""borrowed"" from the latter. Arnold Vosloofrom the Mummy movies is an excellent choice as Russiangeneral/mobster Simconov. Ursula Karven is luscious. Abit of macabre humour involves one of Simconov's men -apparently something of a vampire, he enjoys bitinginto and mutilating men he has shot. The film has a surpriseending that make the story more interesting. A good DVD to see."
2,MacGyver on stupid pills,"As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action."
1,Alaska-Home of the Bad Action Movie,"This movie really isn't that bad.The acting isn't ponderous or terribly compelling, the story line is interesting, perhaps a little predictable.What kills the movie is the huge number of continuity problems.The soundtrack is terrible. Typical canned background score.I don't want to say too much about this movie. Watch it once. Or not. Its not the end of the world either way."
5,Thank you to Mary Boyce !,"As a passionate amateur of the Shahnameh which led me to the history of ancient Persia, to the Avesta and to the zoroastrianism, I am so glad I found many answers in Mary Boyce book. I choosed this one because she is a reknowned scholar on the subject and I am looking for objectivity. I wish other scholars had done this attempt to address to amateur by writing so serious a book."
5,Smashing!,"An anthology of Mark Steyn's work is like giving a drug addict a large supply and telling them to only use a little at a time. It's impossible and it won't happen. I received this just two days ago and have already finished it!Mark Steyn From Head To Toe is a collection of his columns dating back to the early 1990s loosely arranged by the theme of the human body. The essays cover everything from the Clinton impeachment, popular culture and Election 2000 to politics in Canada, the U.S. and Britain. If you've ever read Steyn you know each essay is a combination of humour and erudite analysis. Word play that serves not only to make you laugh, but make real points.There are some real standouts such as his 2001 piece on Mordechai Richler but that said there are no clunkers in the whole bunch. If you love Steyn, you'll love Mark Steyn From Head To Toe."
5,Steyn Divine,"Mark Steyn has written some of most intensely funny and provocative political and cultural material I've read yet. This book is filled with clever, witty incisive humor and powerful observations. His essay on Sinatra is a gem and his conclusions about celebrities in general is masterful. I cannot recall reading so much laugh-out-loud verbiage in ages -- Steyn is truly divine.But don't pass this off as simply humor. It's far more and it's brilliantly written. He rips everyone without mercy but he also tells the truth; it's not funny unless it contains a kernel of truth. Steyn's essays contain the whole cob.His genius shines through on every page and his writing is probably better than anyone in his genre and probably better than those outside his genre.How can he keep up such near-perfection this consistently, essay after essay, and where has he been all my life? Buy this book and give it to everyone you know with a brain."
5,"The funniest political commentator today, bar none","Mark Steyn's writing is brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant. His honest, no-nonsense (yet hilarious) insights into the double troubles of Islamofacism and the West's (especially Europe's)politically and demographicaly appeasing responses are priceless ... and cost him his job in Britain ... two British newspapers just this weekend dropped him for being too hot. My conservative British friends love him ... and are distraught at this. Mark is a breath of fresh air. Always fresh. Buy this book and enjoy some fantastic writing. A true Renaissance man."
5,Their best collaboration!!,"Grusin and Ritenour recorded their best album in 1986. With the help of Brazilian Jazz extrordanaire, Ivan Linz, the recording becomes an exillarating and refreshing listen. From ""Early A.M. Attitude"" to ""San Ysidro"" to ""Grid-Lock"" to ""The Bird"", this album is about as complete as it can be and is a landmark release in the development of the Smooth Jazz genre. A ""must have"" for fans of Contemporary Jazz!!"
4,cant keep kitty away,My cat found this hidden in a double bag. good catnip smell but need a way to repace the catnip.
5,very good!,This is my little kitten favorite toy. He has so much fun with it all the time... It is the best thing to see him enjoy his toy so much... I definetely recommend it.
3,Don't expect miracles,"Hey, it's a nice little thing, but my cat didn't take to it at all. I wanted to note that here since all the reviews that I read prior to buying raved about it unconditionally, so it should be said that your cat, like mine, may not give a hoot."
4,Great hold without leaving my hair feeling heavy ...,Great hold without leaving my hair feeling heavy or greasy. I've tried other L'Oreal Studio Line hair products and prefer this one over the rest.
4,I used this product on my daughter's very ...,I used this product on my daughter's very fine hair to help hold her hair when I style it. It worked very well on her fine hair and didn't make it look sticky or greasy. Super easy to distribute into her hair.
4,This hair gel is great stuff! First of ...,"This hair gel is great stuff! First of all, you use only half the amount of gel that you'd normally use with another gel product -- which saves you money. Secondly, and more important, this gel not only has vitamins in it, but it's also a far-superior gel to most other gels I've used. My hair now has staying power without looking stiff. GREAT stuff!"
2,This product takes extra hold to the limit. ...,"This product takes extra hold to the limit. My husband, son and I tried this product. Our hair was difficult to style after using this gel. It was like our hair was glued in place. Our hairstyles didn't look natural. Once the product was in our hair and dried, we had white flakes in our hair too. I had to rewash and style my hair again without the gel. I couldn't recommend this product to others for these reasons. I realize some hairstyles require this strong hold, but most styles of our region are more relaxed and natural looking. We use gels and sprays but not to this extreme."
4,"When I first received this product, I thought ...","When I first received this product, I thought it would be mainly for people with straight hair. I have a body wave and medium to long hair that falls past my shoulders. I curl it every morning with a large barrel curling iron. I'd been using one particular mousse because it made my hair look healthier and made it more manageable. This product actually worked better for me. It makes my hair FEEL thicker, yet doesn't weigh it down. I like body and can still style my hair with body throughout."
3,"The product worked well, but it left my ...","The product worked well, but it left my hair feeling sticky. I don't like the sticky feeling in my hair. The only advantage this product had was it held up well for me. I have straight hair that holds no curl unless I have something in it to help hold it, and it did that. But I hated that sticky feeling. If that doesn't bother someone, then this stuff will work great for them. But I didn't like it myself."
4,This product was very good. The hold was ...,"This product was very good. The hold was superb and it wasn't a """"heavy"""" feeling on my hair. I liked the texture and feel of this product also. It comes in a very appealing-to-the-eye package and in a very nice size. I would recommend it to all my friends and family if they're looking for a product of this type."
4,"The gel certainly does hold your hair, or ...","The gel certainly does hold your hair, or those flyaway ends in place. However I personally felt that it was too thick. L'Oreal makes a similar product called Melting Gel, which I much prefer, and which is a much thinner gel."
2,I didn't care for this product for my ...,"I didn't care for this product for my particular hairstyle (curly and long). It was too sticky and if applied wet, it was hard to style my hair. If applied dry, it makes my hair look wet and/or greasy. This product may be perfect for those that like the """"wet look,"""" or for those who don't have much styling to do, but I just want a smooth look."
5,Excellent,Very interesting material.. also it goes hand in hand with the Grimoire for the green witch.
2,not as good as the first two,"this book is a text book and she uses the other 2 books as text book. this book is very boring and it drags along. she does have good info,but the way she represents it is very boring and tiring. like the reviewer below it reminds you of being in school"
1,Thrice Hooey,"Here is yet another in the endless river of ""making up Wicca as you go along"" books. Green Witchccraft III is an amatuer book chock full of altered and fabricated history, fake lore, poorly invented concepts, worn out and re-hashed Wiccan material.Essentially what the author has served up is another tasty ""fast food"" book with little nutrition."
3,For Sci-Fi movie history buffs,"If you can remember those old late night reruns of the 1950's classic Sci-Fi movies, you will enjoy some of the spoofs in this movie. And seeing the last appearances of some of the original B-movie actors of that era will be a most touching experience. Can only watch this one once though. That's enough. Then pass it on to someone else."
2,Not the same seats pictured...,"Seats are pretty nice and are good for the price. However, the seats are not the same pictured! These have a yellow 3a Racing stitched into the top and the ones I received say ""tuned by matrix"" in white... I'm going to keep them because its going in my off road vehicle and they are still comfortable, it just would be nice if amazon would sell something that is pictured and not something completely different.Boxes came completely trashed, and I'm surprised that the seats weren't torn or damaged. I did however have to run to my local hardware store because the included hardware was no where to be found. Long story short, they work, just don't expect to get what is pictured."
5,Proxabrush handle,"We have not been able to find these brushes in the stores as we used to, so it is nice to know that we can go to Amazon and get them."
1,DOUBLE CASE FOR FLUTE AND PICCOLO,NOT WHAT I ORDERED. THIS WAS A CASE COVER FOR A FLUTE. WHAT I TRIED TO ORDER WAS A CASE FOR BOTH THE FLUTE AND PICCOLO. A DOUBLE CASE.
2,Boring and Predictable,"I really enjoy novels by Susan Mallery. This was the exception. I thought her portrayal of traditional Italian and Irish families was beyond stereotypical, and quite frankly offensive at times. There was nothing lovable about the Marcelli clan and I kept hoping Katie would tell them all where they could go stick their pushy, nosy, and persistent demands. This is one family I would hate to be a member of.The chemistry between Zach and Katie was less than scintillating and I had to force myself to read the last few chapters. I doubt I'll be reading the remaining novels in the series."
5,"Fun, Human, and Humorous","If you enjoy reading as a break from the everyday chalenges of the world, this series is perfect. There is typical family interaction, great characters, huge amounts of humor that will make you laugh out loud, and sufficient romance to make you feel good at the end. Enjoy!"
4,A Pretty Good Book.,"I personally don't think this is the strongest book in the series but it is pretty good over all. Out of the 5 books in this series, books 2,3 and 4 were my personal favorites. Yes, the grandfather is strict and bossy but it is exactly how I would picture an old world Italian grandfather. The closeness of the sisters are evident in this whole series although Mia is flighty in them all. I like the Grands and how they think food will solve all world problems. All in all this is good series and worth purchasing."
5,Wonderful new series.,"A wonderful new series with just the right amount of love, passion, and the age old need to defend your sister! I just wish some of the history was clearer."
2,Too contrived to be useful,"Barbara Coloroso's comparisons between the ""three types of families"" is painfully contrived and unrealistic, serving only to provide ""straw men"" against which she can positively compare her ""backbone family"". This limits the useful applicability of much of her book.On the other hand, some of her examples of how to deal with common situations (most memorably, mild rebellion and ""tattling"") are well-thought-out and well-described and useful applications of clear insight and common sense to child-rearing situations.These individual gems of wisdom are, unfortunately, rather sparsely presented throughout the morass of overblown philosophy. So while the book is not without merit, I cannot recommend it."
1,Great Book,"I purchased this book after seeing Barbara Coloroso in person. While her writing is not quite as dramatic as her in person, it is an excellent read. She offers many suggestions that are practical and easily implemented. I highly suggest all her books, especially 'The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander'."
1,How to fail as a parent,"Ms. Coloroso's new age ideas about discipline provide a sure way to lose your children to the miriad of liberal influences promoted by mass media and public education. What parents need is to return to the fundamentals of strong family, respect, and traditional discipline. Coloroso's book leads you in the exact opposite direction of this ideal. Typically American."
5,It's my bible.,I am studying child and youth work at Fanshawe college and we use this book as one of our texts. The priciples that Coloroso teaches seem too easy but it is amazing how emotionally ditrubed children in group homes respond to her methods. This book is my bible!
4,Interesting Approach,"Due to the views expressed at the beginning of this book, I found myself saying, ""I shouldn't have bought this book!"" However, after reading more, I found myself agreeing with a great deal of what Coloroso says, to my surprise. Her ideas on childrearing, although a bit simplistic at times, do have some great worth in application. Although I felt that this book is better geared for raising teens, some concepts can be applied to younger children quite well. Her approach is about teaching and modeling respect, which I can say is very much lacking in our culture today. A good book to keep in the family library!"
5,The life I want with my kids,"Wonderful techniques that respect all parties involved as individuals. It is exactally how I want to raise my children. Very useful and motivating. More importantly it is positive!! I learned a lot about myself, my upbringing, and new applications of discipline. Thank you Mrs. Coloroso!"
4,Kids Are worth it,The Author lays out in a clear and consise manner the most familiar parenting styles we all have. In a loving manner she clearly points out the already known outcomes of how you were parented and that you are not alone in this. Easy to follow new parenting styles and how to use them.
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this book as a gift for a friend who is interested in the history of Christianity. I chose this book thinking that it would have scholarly merits. To my utmost frustration, this book is full of propoganda. There is neither the slightest respect for the non-christian cultures mentioned in it, nor any objectivity with respect to the relationships between the non-christian and christian communities. There are even strong statements towards some cultures which express much more than dislike. It is hard to beleive and sad to see that it was authored by a ""scholar""."
5,Transformation in Christ,"If you like St. Augustine, Thomas A. Kempis, St. John of the Cross, G.K. Chesterton and Thomas Merton, this book summerizes all of them. Written by a Catholic, it has no ""Church"" leanings except in it's deepest Philosophy. Reading it again for the second time. This book must be read slowly as it is a journey into the deepest parts of your soul. You will find yourself changing the way you think and act about everything. Each chapter is another few steps down into the dungeon of your most intimate being only to emerge into a new light of a brighter world. All written with a Scritural basis. NO sugar-coating here!Everyone seriously considering achieving the ultimate prize must read this book. You may want to read it slowly without outside distractions for as long as it takes since there are no wasted words. People will notice a change in you as you WILL be a new person.You will want everyone to read this, especially those closest to you."
3,"Really 3.5, good effort, AI missed out","Ayla should have gone much farther, certainly as far as Kat McPhee, on AI. Her voice is just as strong without the aloofness of KM. I prefer Tina Arena's version of ""River"" but overall, the CD is a good 1st effort and sadly, better than Taylor Hicks post AI CD and I like Taylor Hicks. He's cool live so catch him that way. On this CD, standouts are Forward, Falling into You and Know You Better. In fact, Falling Into You could easily be hit on the radio, big time. I'm conflicted over Suga. It's catchy but really hard to nail down the beat. I guess that makes her a better singer because I could never sing along with it. The song Breaking Away however; is very high school musical. It should be in a Disney TV original about b'ball. Ten Cent Wings doesn't thrill me, either but I do hope she comes up with more."
2,Average or Below,"This album is average at best. I love American Idol and do get caught up in the talents of each contestant. I fell for this one and remember , there are reasons that people don't win. The only reason I wrote this review was that I could not believe all the great reviews I read in this forum. I guess that Ayla has a lot of friends. Medicre album. Don't waste your money."
1,Just For Kids,"Absolutely no bounce, when they say ""one piece"" they mean the strings too! Maybe OK if you have an especially destructive 3 yr old who wants to join in the game."
3,Hmm.....,"ok, i only read 3 of the stories so far, so dont count my rating. the one with drizzt was unbelievably boring though, as was the one with arilyn. the really cool one was ""the last drink"" by christie golden which had the vampire elf jander summerstar, who is really cool. i liked that story.....:)"
2,"Too plastic, too artificial ...","When comparing with LPs like ""No Mistery"" these Elektric Bands sound like ""elevator music"". And the eletronic drums with SOUND of eletronic drums is too bad for my ears. I don't like these CD. Sorry Mr. Corea !!!"
5,WOW! AWESOME!!!,This band is AMAZING. It reminds me a lot of kid dynamite mixed a little bit with the old The Offspring.
5,THIS ALBUM FLAT OUT ROCKS.,"THESE GUYS ARE AMAZING. I HAVE SEEN THESE GUYS PLAY AND THEY ARE MY FAVOTIE BAND. THEY HAVE CATCHY TUNES LIKE WHO'S JOHNNY AND SONGS ABOUT LIFE LIKE I REMEMBER, MY LIFE AND MANY MORE. THIS IS O9NE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME AND THESE KIDS ARE YOUNG AND THEY HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY. tHIS ALBUM IS FULL ON PUNK AND IT IS INTENSE. ALL THESE SONGS ARE HOW THEY SEE LIFE AND WHAT THEIR OUTLOOK ON IT ALL IS.I WOULD DEFINATELY PICK THIS ONE UP, IT IS WORTH EVERY CENT."
5,Great Latin Jazz !!!!!,"First, the tracks:1. Awakening2. Oasis3. Bones4. Love Light in Fight5. Jungle Garden6. Very Nice Indeed7. I Loves you Porgy8. Eighty-One9. Tabasco.This is just another real gem by one of the greatest flutist in the Jazz realm, and the best in Latin Jazz.The best two cuts by far are: ""Very Nice Indeed"" with Tania Maria on the piano, and the killer cut Tabasco.Get it while you can if you're a Latin Jazz fan, this has been O.O.P. for many years now."
4,Early Spanish Account of the Far East.,"This book, written by a Spanish author some 400 years ago, should be an interesting source of information on the Far East as it was known to Europeans at that time. Interesting for those with a dedicated passion for the region and the era, otherwise of course a bit hard-going read."
5,The Country Caruso,"What can be said about Johnny Bush that hasn't already been said. Johnny has one of the best voices ever, in any genre of music. THis album is a good one. These are the original cuts of these songs, not remakes. My only criticism regarding this collection is that the song, ""Whisky River"" is missing. My favorite song is the Willie Nelson penned, ""Undo the Right"". Johnny really makes this song come to life. If you are true country music fan, you'll love this album."
5,Johnny Bush - 14 Greatest Hits,Excellent CD. I am wearing it out playing it over and over. Such a distinctive voice and he uses it well.
4,Five Children and It,"A super fun book, especially to read with your kids. I read this book when I was a girl and was so happy to see the Kindle version available."
3,"""It"" takes me back","I loved this as a child, but I'm grown up now! It's for those who like nostalgia, make believe and an old fashioned view of how little girls and boys should behave."
3,Five Children and It,"I didn't enjoy this book very much. It just wasn't what I expected although I'm sure some have found it to be a great book, it just wasn't for me."
3,Falls flat,"A quartet of well-behaved children, a fairy who grants wishes, and the English countryside -- what's not to like?Here's what: the children out-right squander about half of their wishes. And for the rest, they spent most of their time struggling against the bad effects of their wishes. And the end of the book wraps up with very little changed in the world or in the characters.Too much ""the fisherman and his wife"", too little magical whimsical effect.Along with some other readers, I found this book by following references from Edward Eager. Sadly (for this book), Eager did it a lot better. However, I do like the other Nesbitt book I read, and I'm willing to try more."
3,5 children discover a wish giving creature in the sand.,This book was a great fantasy book for young readers.Since it was written quite a few years ago the english is a little hard to understand and the book's a little slow until you get to the middle.If you are patient with books and like to read fantasy fiction this is the book for you.
4,Very good,"This book is very good. The book is really exciting, you never know what's going to happen next .However the language is quite old and hard to understand."
5,"A Sweet, Entertaining Story","Years ago, we saw the movie made from this book as a family, and were impressed with what a nice story it was. I didn't know there even WAS a book until I found an old copy that was falling apart in a local bookstore. What a treat to see it as a free Kindle book! The overall story line does not have much of a plot, but each chapter is quirky, fun, and fairly quickly-paced. I got plenty of chuckles out of it, and my children certainly enjoyed reading it on their own; the unpredictable nature of fulfilled wishes kept us guessing, and the fact that all of the children in the story ended up safely at home each night meant that this was a great bedtime read. I am so glad we found it. (I can't always say that!)"
5,page-turner,"This book was amazing! Interesting,clever,cute,and just all around fun! I could not put the book down. Perfect for children and adults!LOVED IT!!!!!"
4,a pleasant book for kids,"my children enjoyed this book very much, it isnicely written, and it is a very enjoyable storyfor young children"
1,UGH!,I feel like the director and the actors owe me my time spent watching this trash back. Do NOT waste your time on this garbage.
3,"When I first tried this product nothing happened, ...","When I first tried this product nothing happened, so I decided to try the product again, putting on more than one application. It worked, and I achieved an almost natural coloring. I had to apply a third application before the product started to take on the look of real tan. I like the way the product looks after three layers. It doesn't look too dark, just like a light, natural tan. Depending on the cost of the product, I'd use it again. It takes so many applications that a bottle is used up quickly. The tanning solution doesn't stay on the skin for very long."
4,Just as expected.,"I didn't want a dark tan, just some nice color. So my wife and I both tried it. My skin turned out nicely, almost a natural tan color. My wife found the same results, she's fairer than I am, and it was fine except that when she washed her hands some water must have dripped onto her leg and it left a smear-drip mark. That isn't Neutrogena's fault...just be careful until it is dry.Other than that I'm pleased. Not perfect, of course, but worth 4 stars."
4,I love the way it sprays on and ...,I love the way it sprays on and the overall look of the product. I'd recommend this product to all my friends and family.
5,no orange skin!,"Great stuff. Went on evenly with a bit of hand smoothing and actually made my skin look naturally tan, not orange and fake looking. I'm a gardener and had really tan legs and white feet from wearing sneakers in the garden all summer. Time to dress up in fancy sandals caused me to carefully rub some of this tanner on my feet and they looked fine."
2,No color plates,When I buy a book about an artist I expect to see pictures....with color. The few small prints of the paintings are all in black and white. I was totally bummed.
3,An early insight into Triple Crown Roadrailers,"This 16 Page black and white Pictorial book has some useful information about the early 1980's to early 1990's years of the Triple Crown Roadrailer. There are a lot of pictures of the 48' Mark IV trailers and some of the ""then new"" Mark V 53' trailers. The pictures are a bit grainy and not that clear however details can be seen under bright light. There is a Lot of useful data that is great for details for the Model Railroader. This laminated paperback book was released back in 1993 and retailed at that time for $14.95. If you are interested in the Triple Crown Roadrailer, this is a good book for reference."
3,an ok purchase,hot stuff. hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot.Good reading. You will enjoy it. stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff hot stuff.
2,"Comprehensive, lack in depth and poor organization","For a starter, this book does offer a broad spectrum of subjects, volatility/variance measurement, PCAs, Factor Models, Time Series analysis, high frequency data modeling, etc, at the expense of rigor and depth.Desipite the academic pedigree the author enjoys and the educational career she had, the book is rather poorly organized from a pedagogical point of view. She seems to have a tendency to refer to expressions, notions, ideas, data which appear much later than where the reference takes place. This makes first-timers cringe as they go through the chapters as they are laid out. It reads much like some published papers got dumbed down, and bundled together.If you are looking for comprehensive introduction, without the gory details of mathematical mumblejumble, this book might be of help. But it may not be used as a reference book, for its organization and for its lack of rigor."
5,A financial Bible for both profesionals and researchers,"Market Models is an essential tool for practioners who would like to gain fundamental expertise on financial modeling. Aside from the practical view, Alexander's book has got such a clear and comprehensive reading that even the most inexpert individuals can get enthusiastically involved in learning issues related to risk management, investment analysis and financial forecasting. Recent econometric techniques on time series are brilliantly applied with real examples on the finance field. The book demonstrates that the author has a great knowledge on both a theoretical as well as a practical basis on market modeling and knows how to combine the two aspects in a very intelligent way. I considered this book to be a fundamental reference for either financial profesionals and academics."
5,Excellent,Carol Alexander is a highly respected risk manager. Her book is very easy to understand and comprehend and the accompanying CD helps with setting up and working through problems.
2,Very shallow,You can google in 10 minutes more relevant information than this book is able to provide. It's OK if you need to pick up some terminology and get a rough idea of what it all means before an interview. Totally useless if you need it for work.
3,"Same cd, different cover.",'Issues' is my least favorite KoRn cd. I would give it a three. This is the same thing as the U.S. version but the cover is worse. The four U.S. covers are much better. Get those versions if you want this cd. Its not a must have though.
4,entertaining niche film for comic fans and people who like broad comedy,"This film deserves more attention than it gets; it's more enjoyable than alot of the comedies out there even if one has no interest in the comic book aspect shown in the film. That can be looked at as a frame for the characters and an incidental device to move the plot along. Of particular interest in the piece, even for people who are not comic fans, are the distinct characters and their quirky mannerisms, even the actors without as much screen time in this cast stand out. It's an interesting yet sometimes funny study of what greed can make people do, and how any type of obessession can bring out the worst emotions in people. It is held together quite well by the narration of one of the main characters, and in spite of its title manages to hit more than one emotional note throughout. It deserves a much wider audience because of the fine character acting of the entire cast."
3,Twisted Fan Fun,"A nice little black comedy without grand pretensions. My teen fanboy and I watched it together and had a ripping time. The big plot developments were easy to anticipate, but there were little twists along the way that added some amusement. A definite for people who know the sub-culture, may seem contrived to an outsider, but not as much as one might think."
2,Two Thumbs Down...,"I'm glad this was only a rental. Comic Book Villains bit. And in a major way. I couldn't even muster enough interest to finish it. What's exciting about watching two desperate geeks try to wheedle an old woman out of an expensive comic book collection? (The only thing worse, was WATCHING this happen), (sigh).While I was prepared to find a few laughs and inside jokes in ""Comic Book Villains"" (I AM a nerd after all), instead, the movie didn't even produce a chuckle. I'd save this film for only hard core geeks, who want to see their fellows in all their laughable humiliation-filled glory on DVD.Otherwise, give this one a pass."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"As a huge fan of comic books, I was so excited about this film. But as the movie unfolded before my eyes, all I felt was cheated by what could have been. Do not waste your time or money on this one. Go see a film like Unbreakable to see what a real movie of the genre can be like."
5,Love this book,This was the first book I read in the Dark series and it's still my favourite. I love the way Christine writes and the characters and plots are very original and engaging. I highly recommend all of Christine's books!
4,Love these Carpathian Men - they're Randy!,"Loved the story line and the action of this story. While the men are still in the dark ages, the women are sassy and spunky - yea for them.BY THE WAY, HOW DO WE GET DARK PRINCE ON THE USA KINDLE?"
3,I strugged with this one,"I readily admit I'm new to Feehan's work. The first book (and mainly because I own a Kindle and not all her work is Kindle available) I've read of the Dark Series was Dark Fire. I enjoyed it immensely as it had some verbal bantering, hot & steamy scenes and the typical Alpha Male. Although Dark Guardian had an alpha in Lucian it just didn't hold my attention that Dark Fire did. Actually, I couldn't wait to end this book. I felt the characters were likable (both were appealingly lonely, both strong & confident who sacrificed their personal lives to keep loved-ones safe from harm) but the plot just dragged and dragged. Lucian didn't really have to ""win"" her. Jaxon accepted the lifestyle way too easily and her random misgivings were more annoyingly fake than genuine. I gave this book three stars because I liked the characters, liked the idea of these two characters finding one another but the story just didn't have the ""punch"" that I was looking for."
3,A bit of a disappointment.,"Like everyone else, I patiently wait for this book to come out. I was very disapointed with the story. Gabriel's story really captured your attention and I thought that Lucian's would be just as good. I found Jaxon ""whiny"" and hyprocritical. The whole build up with her step-father was very good, but the final confrontation (if you could call it that) was terrible. I hope further books in the series are more well thought out."
2,Dissapointing: Not the story for Lucian I expected,"Lucian, the legendary twin Carpathian warrior over 2,000 yrs. old who has sacrificed over time for his people and his brother...selfless, intelligent, creative, warrior, unsurpassed by any other...How could he possibly find his match in a young teenage girl type pixie cop from america who scales walls to ""protect"" Lucian and kicks him in the knee like a child to get his attention? really? after the masterpiece story and novel his brother Gabriel (book 7) was given I expected Lucian's to be a masterpiece as well. I have read ALL the Carpathian novels and this was the most dissapointing and not deserving of Lucian's legendary status. Skip it and make up your own story/fantasy about Lucian anything would be better than this one."
5,WOW!,"I could not put this book down! I loved it. I'm a new fan. I've read this book twice now. The only disapointment was the final battle between Jaxon's father and Lucian. I expected more. But over all, WOW!"
5,Wonderful paranormal series,"When I first started to read this book, I was confused. I didn't any on the Dark series before this. At first, I thought the worst of Lucian but then it slowly made sense. I think Christine Feehan did any exelent job of discribing a world that is imaginary and discribing the origin of vampires.As I read the book, I was caught up in a world that vampires and ghouls do run around and we need a race like the Carpathians to keep us safe. I think the scenes are described very well and if someone is looking to read a book about the paranormal with romance, the Dark series is an excelent series to read. I can't wait to read the other books!"
3,"Good, Lucian a little mellower male...","Not as good as Dark Legend. These two didn't seem as perfect a fit as Gabriel and Francesca. I loved that the other couples are mentioned more often in this installment of the series. I enjoyed Jaxon's past as a paramilitary trainee and saucy policewoman, but she just flopped as a heroine. She was just a whimp and I expected more strength and maturity from that type of character. And give me a break, a sniper from one mile away straight through a spinal cord? ha ha. And very unlikely that the oldest ancient and most cunning hunter didn't have a clue? I felt that Gabriel needed Francesca more, Francesca was so strong and confident. I hoped for some of that in Jaxon but got none of it.I really enjoyed the ending, great ending. But overall not as good as Dark Legend, Dark Gold, Dark Magic, or Dark Challenge."
4,Enjoyable book but not her best,"I am a fan of Christine Feehan's books. I looked forward to this book but found it fell a little flat. Jaxxon started as a very complex character with tremendous potential but by the end of the book as flat and defined by one or two traits no where near as interesting as Destiny in Dark Destiny or Natalya in Dark Demon.Lucian had no challenge worthy of him to really push him to grow, although how you would do that with the greatest known Carpathian is a true creative challenge for Ms. Feehan. I would enjoy to see a challenge worthy of getting the twins back together. Seeing the interchange between the brothers shows a side you rarely get to see of the Carpathians. I would like to be a fly on the wall for a Daranatoff family reunion.Enjoyable read but she has not yet begun her major story arc with the mages and the Morrison institute. It is a stand alone work. Helpful to read Dark Legend first but not essential."
3,Not as good as the rest,I have every single Dark series and I was very surprised at how boring this one was. It doesn't even seem like it was written by Christine Feehan. The two main characters had no depth. I was really looking forward to Lucian's story but it was a disappointment.I will keep it because it's part of the series but I doubt I will be rereading this book like I have the others.
4,This is more like it!,"After impatiently waiting the arrival of Dark Legend I was disappointed with the story. But, Dark Guardian is much better! Lucien is more like Gregory and the Prince. You can believe he can actually do anything. I liked this book very much and would recommend reading it."
5,Sexy vampires,"I absoluetly love Christine Feehan, I suggest you read everything she writes! I've been making my way through the entire Dark series."
2,Too many repetitive sex scenes,"I had only read one of the Dark Guardian series (Dark Desire) and kind of liked it--it was a good summer read. Since the reviews indicated that Feehan tended to use the same plot device over and over, I read the descriptions about the other books and bought Dark Guardian since it sounded interesting.It was vaguely interesting although I found the part about her stepfather killing everyone she loves over the years a little far fetched. However Ms. Feehan was either unable or unwilling to develop the plot more fully so she added lots of sex scenes between the two leading characters. And I mean a lot. She writes in great detail about them making love, and then afterwards they have a short conversation and then go at it again. I started skimming through the sex about three-fourths of the way through the book. And how many times can he thrust his fingers into her hot sheath? Many times apparently---I wanted to scream: find another descriptive phrase!"
3,Good story but the ending was not satisfying,I love Christine Feehan's books and this was no different. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the novel. The suspense of when Jaxon's stepfather was going to strike and who he would kill was built up throughout the book. The ending then disappointed me. The suffering that the stepfather had inflicted on Jaxon was so great that I felt he should have had a battle with Jaxon or a more gruesome ending than how he was dealt with at the end. My friend who read the book also agreed with me. The book was great until the ending. It disappointed me so much that I am only giving this 3 stars. The book is worth reading but readers will find the final battle a disappointment.
3,Wonderfully told,Having read all of the books thus far I have to say Dark Guardian is my favorite to date. I think most fans of the Dark series were eager to see Lucian finally find some happiness after his sacrifices for his brother in Dark Legend. The many transformations of the helpless girlie psychics was kind of getting old in the other books so it was a refreshing change to see Jaxx just roll with it and keep going. No hysterics for this heroine! Lucian was the first of the Carpathians to really display a distinct difference in his manner after finding his lifemate and the playfulness of their relationship was fun to read.I have to say the premise is getting kind of old for this series but they are still very well written.
4,An improvement over the last in the series....,"Dark Guardian is an improvement over its predecessor in the series. Feehan was able to add some variety in characterization, but the premise is getting old. Maybe it's time for a super FEMALE Carpathian?"
1,Not worth your time or money,"Not interesting at all. No fear to overcome. No thrill. No building passion. Nothing. There has to be some common sense present even in a fantasy novel. The other ""Dark"" books are just as bad. Don't buy them. Can someone point me to a real vampire romance?"
3,Good story,"It is a good book. It follows the series well, the plot stays with the ones that come before it.The sex scenes are too drawn out, the story line is good though. I have become accustom to skipping the 3-4 page long sex and then starting to read again.I'll continure to buy the dark series, just because I like the stories."
3,Dark Guardian Reader Review,"Many of the elements of this book are good, like the details about Lucian, his many abilities to shape shift, become mist, and the descriptions of 'Carpathian' life in general. However, this book is really more of a romance novel than a diehard vampire novel, and it seems to get somewhat sappy at times, especially the parts about the 'delicate, fragile, vulnerable' Jaxon (female lead)and her quote unquote 'savior' Lucian. In truth it almost reminds me of daytime soaps. The romantic scenes are also quite repetetive in nature. If you like that type of romantic novel, this may be for you, but if you prefer heavier on mystery/vamps and slightly less on romance, I would recommend Blackwood Farm(Anne Rice) or Crimson City (Liz Maverick)."
1,Boring and unbelievable,"Many mysteries depend to a certain extent on coincidence, but this one seems to do so because it's too lazy to do anything else. There is little tension, little excitement, little reason to care about any of the people in the book. The main character muses on this and that as she makes her way around Cambridge, but her observations seem shallow and obvious. The one piece of real history that is discussed touches tangentially on the plot but without adding any depth. Motivations for various actions are plopped onto the page, stirred for a bit, and then left half baked.Save your money."
5,This is a Great DVD,Sergei is a joy to watch. He is very dedicated to raw food and loves to share this with people. I would recommend this DVD. It is educational and fun to watch.
1,I'm not happy with this deal,The item arrived with display spoiled. It is impossible to set it.I'm really upset with this item. I was the firt bad experience buying eletronic equipment through Amazon web site.
1,Three words: DO NOT BUY,"I own one of these, but, fortunately, I did not buy it at this outrageous price. First of all, it's NOT an iPod Nano, just iPod Nano-sized. Therefore, it does not guarantee an Apple-like quality for videos, etc. It's sound quality sucked! The video quality sucked! And to add insult to injury, you can't change the earphones because its jacks are made specifically for the earphones provided! Second of all, it crashes easily. I bought mine (for US $5 in Hong Kong), and it broke after I loaded about ten songs on it. Also, after I uploaded a thirty minute lecture, it just crashed. It refused to reboot or restart. Thirdly, it doesn't play certain videos. Most of us have .avi and .mov, but this only accepts .mp4, so a conversion is required.In conclusion, don't buy it. Save up for a real iPod nano or iRiver. Anything but this!"
2,You Get What you Pay For,"Where do I start? Sound quality is poor. The only movies it will pay are AMV, which is some obscure format that hardly anyone knows about. The manual says there is an AMV converter to play your movies on it but it is not on the CD. The AMV converter I downloaded for free does not format the video correctly, therefore, the video just stops playing or the sound is garbled. MP3 sound is noisy and unclear. They tried to do too much with this little player and none of it works well. The only good thing I can say is that it is inexpensive. I would only recommend this for a child as a toy and if they break or loose it, you're not out IPod type of dollars!"
4,Good book,It could have been a little bit longer but I think that the book is good. I am looking forward to the other books.
5,very nice album,"maybe Gala is not so good like Enigma,gregorian,amethystium ordelerium but still sounds great."
1,Just aweful.,"Cheesy pop music and a bunch of gurgling voices trying to pass as Gregorian chants. It sounds more like some guys who got together in college all taking a latin class decided they could pull this one off. It's contrived, it's corny, it's amatur. Don't waste your time on this one."
5,These work very well for their intended purpose. ...,"These work very well for their intended purpose. The strong smell does help when it gets through a stuffy nose. They're strong enough to handle the worst of colds, too. I wouldn't use them as a regular tissue, though. They don't work very well when cleaning your glasses."
5,best tissue,"This is the best tissue available. But grocery stores aren't carrying it anymore. Buying online is a problem, though since you can't choose the box design and many of the boxes arrived with crushed corners."
4,Making Sense of Qualitative Data,This was ordered for a course that I am taking. It has taken almost one full month to receive this book. NOT GOOD! I will NEVER order school books from this site again.
5,"Buy it, Read it, Live it.","An absolute gem. Small enough to keep on your person, big enough to change your mind."
1,The most foul tasting powder i ever had.,I bought this because of glowing reviews and supposedly the lack of bad chemicals. Everyone kept touting the flavor so imagine my surprise when i had to gag to get it down. This stuff is foul plain and simple. The chocolate is slightly more palatable but not by much. I finally mixed i with another powder brand to cover up the gross taste. Its simply not palatable. Disgusting to say the least! I have a tin staring at me i fear...
1,Why is there Soy in this?,"Why is there Soy and Fructose in this? Soy is much less expensive than whey isolate or the like. I was about to purchase this and noticed some of the other reviews. I noticed this product due to the Consumer Reports article. I guess I will be going back to ON whey, but this time the platinum I suppose. Was looking for the safest alternative but also dont want to spend extra money on inexpensive soy product. I read the ingredients list and it says ""++contains whey and soy"" on the ""whey"" ingredient. Ok, its one ingredient, how can a single item on an ingredient list be two things? List it seperately so we know what amount is in there. Solgar please respond."
4,healthier option in protein powders,"We chose this brand of protein powder because Consumer Reports rated it well regarding low levels of lead, cadmium and other dangerous substances found in some other popular protein powders. It tastes fine, takes a bit of work to dissolve if just stirring into something, but has good ingredients and I'd recommend it."
5,Excellent and delicious whey formulation,"I like the Solgar and the Jay Robb whey products a lot. The Solgar, however, is a much better price. This is a very clean protein with some nice extras like L-Glutamine and BCAAs. It isn't inexpensive but it is worth it simply because of the high quality.I disagree with the folks slamming the new formulation for containing soy. It contains less than 1% of Soy Lecithin - lecithin being good in and of itself. They clearly aren't ""cutting"" the nice pure whey protein with cheaper soy protein.Also, I don't know why anyone would say that they are using artificial sweeteners - the only flavorings are ""natural vanilla and caramel flavors"". This is one of the best-tasting whey products on the market and is very delicious without being sweet."
1,GROSS FLAVOR!,"I love Solgar products, but this just tastes chemical-ly and bad. I usually like vanilla too, but this one is terrible. I tried mixing it with so many things, but it didn't help. The chocolate is much much better"
5,Tasty protein,Some protein powders overwhelm the taste of the ingredients in a smoothie. Not so with Whey to Go. I'm very pleased with it; it's a part of my weight loss program.
5,"Lactose free, low sugar",Excellent product for those seeking lactose free and low sugar alternatives for their smoothies. five more words required but not needed. jb
5,Grey's Season 3,Amazing...of course! I seriously don't watch TV - at all. But somehow I got hooked on Grey's Anatomy! The best season so far :)
3,Third season is....,"Third season is not really good compared with season 1 and 2. I enjoy watching the first few episodes where they are still acting like interns, getting snacks for the M&M.;I really hate the two episodes in which Addison goes to the wellness center, I fast-forward when I saw sun and beach, I like the Seattle's weather. One episode is already too much for that, and they have to make it two episodes, gosh!"
2,Disappointment,"I was so excited about this season from commercials that i'd seen on the tele. But I guess you can't trust previews. I was so ready for the season to be over by the middle of it! Such a waste of time with spending whole episodes on Meredith being dead and all -- they just make it too dramatic. Waste of time, waste of money :("
3,A General Comment,"Just a general comment: The creators probably should have stopped at the end of season 2, and gone on to create another show. So much happened in the first two seasons that there just wasnt anywhere for the show to go but south into Ludicrous-ville..."
3,it was ok,"dvds were in great conditions, packaging was good, only thing i hated was the box that they used to put dvds in it, i know that has nothing to do with amazon, but im a neat freak and order freak when it comes to my dvds, so it messed with my system but other wise then that it was great"
2,Depressing.....I think so!,"I absolutely loved the first two Seasons of Greys and was utterly compelled with every episode consistantly wanting to know what happened next. However, Season 3 is a totally different ball game...it just turns into melodramatic soap storylines very early on and my main question is, could anyone else possibly die????? There is no consistensy of quality within the season compared to it's predecessors and it feels like there is little chance it can revive itself (pardon the pun) after such a dismal final episode. Plus season 4 without Burke is going to be cagey at best. Put McDreamy and McSteamy on the shelf and watch something new!"
2,The book was better.,"I was sorely disappointed in the television version of Gray's Anatomy. The book contained far more useful information...after 3 seasons I haven't even noticed a fraction of the material covered within the book.Because of this, I felt sorely under prepared for the appendectomy I had to perform this morning."
1,"Quality of several of the discs was extremely poor, and these discs could not even be watched!","I was both shocked and extremely disappointed at the quality of this DVD. Several discs had such terrible digital problems that they were absolutely unviewable. I feel as if I paid my money in good faith but was totally ""ripped off."" I thought Amazon was known for its outstanding quality, but I now feel very differently. If you shop with Amazon, ""BUYER BEWARE""!!"
1,This is Not the full season.,This is not the full 3rd season. She only sent me disc 2 of the set. Be careful who you buy from. I still have not received my money back although that is what we agreed.
3,Grey's disappointment,"Avid fan. Kept waiting for Season 3 to get better, even rushing home for a few of the episodes. Never did get better. I pray that Season 4 brings some improvement; also BRING Burke BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Where is the video? :,"I've just joined amazon prime and have clicked on this episode...it says it's playing, but where? I can't see it streaming or hear any sound at all :/ can someone help me with this? Thanks :)"
2,All about superficial emotions,"This show tries to induce cheap emotions on the viewer by one of two ways.Technique n. 1 - Sex! Either someone is cheating their wife/husband or people change their mind about who they like as if they were changing shirt. Seattle Grace Hospital looks more like a brothel...Technique n. 2 - Surgery and Death! Everyone has highly improbable medical conditions, that somehow involve surgery, and it's not a simple surgery, it always involves the patient's heart stopping in the middle. Is it just me thinking that it's plain stupid that out of 5 surgery interns, one looses his father, the other her mother and stepmother and another one her fiancee, all in one year?! Don't pick surgery for your careeer as it seems that the probability of someone in your family dying goes up!If you want to watch a good TV show watch Battlestar Galactica."
5,A great show!,"I had the first and second seasons of Grey's anatomy and looked around for a good price. Amazon had a great price and I received the DVD within a few days. The third season is wonderful--entertaining, touching and filled with great performances. It's a series that you can watch again and again and still enjoy every time."
1,Not worth wasting your time over....,"I agree with the majority of the reviewers: Season 3 was the absolute WORST! What is UP with the show's writers? I loved Season 1 & 2, but if the show doesn't get better early on Season 4, I'm going to stop watching it. What a waste of time!"
2,the most overhyped show in history...next to Twin Peaks of course,"No substance whatsoever, it is just like ER except more smutty and with a cast that has no chemistry with one another. They really need to cancel this show and put something of value back on the screen. Providence was a great show and then they canceled it. So tired of people salivating over this series, like Harry Potter fans and the foamy mouth crawling around acting like they just ate a chocolate cake or something."
1,"Grey,,,,,,, Please","Yeah, you just have to sit back and scratch you head in awe at the popularity of this visionary abortion, I remember seeing the first previews of this show, and knew it was junk, and I was right, it is just another med show, don't be fooled, and to make it worse there's some kind of humor to it, better shows fell before this one and it goes to show that sometimes viewers like mindless T.V., I try to watch the show, but I can't seem to get past the first few seconds, even the T.V. spots are anguish"
2,Not up to standard.,"The only episodes I had a problem with were ""Some Kind of Miracle"" and the finale.SKOM jumped the shark for awhile. I just couldn't get into the whole ""Meredith in limbo"" thing. However, the whole Ellis: ""You are anything but ordinary"" embrace was wonderful.I could say ZERO nice things about the finale. I am so sick of the whole Are-Meredith-and-Derek-together saga. Enough already! It was the same thing in the seasons one and two finale! Are they or aren't they? Make a choice, docs!...okay, I'm done."
5,Great !,This was a gift for my cousins daughter. She is very happy with this volume and the others I have bought her. Price was great! Shipping was great recieved when I was told I would get it.
4,Very happy camper,"I've loved Grey's from the first series and while it did lag in the middle of Series 3 I felt this was necessary. There are some awesome episodes in this series not to mention a very impressive soundtrack.The box set is OK. I would prefer better special features, and the discs themselves look a little lack lustre in appearance. Aside from that, this is a must for any Grey's fan, and for $26 it was a total bargain."
2,NOT SO GOOD.,WHAT WAS UP WITH THIS SEASON!! I MEAN IT WAS SOOO... UMMM WHATS THE WORD... BLAH...... IM A GREYS FREAK... THE LAST TWO SEASONS WERE SOO GOOD.... I WAS TOATTLY HOOKED!!!!! THIS SEASON... NOT SO MUCH! I STILL WATCHED EVERY EPISODE HOPING IT WOULD GET BETTER. I HATE THAT A NEW GIRL THAT DEREK IS INTERESTED IN IS COMING ON THE SHOW.. AND GERORGE.. WHAT HAPPEND TO GEORGE... HE ALWAYS HAD ME BUSTING UP... BUT NOT THIS LAST SEASON IT WAS SOO BORING! O-WELL HOPE THIS SEASON IS BETTER AND MUCH FUNNIER AND INTERESTING!
2,if i had to do it all over again,I wouldn't this was just the worst. I was so excited when the season started and quickly down the drain it went. I so agree with the 1st poster the story line was all over the place. And the childish behavior just made this an impossible season to muddle through. So much time on Mer/Der the other storylines were just thrown together or just stupid.not worth 40. bucks or the time to watch again.
2,Disappointing,"One of the discs is very scratched and is so badly damaged that it can't be watched. Since the set was rated as Good, I was expecting a few skips but nothing this bad."
5,Greys Anatomy,Great set of DVDs. My neice and I watched them from beginning to end in a marathon session so we'd be caught up when new season began. Loved them! Story plot is still imaginative. It's hard to imagine how all these educated people get themselves into the situations they find themselves in.
5,PROGRAMMERS MESSING UP A GREAT THING,"I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT THE PROGRAMMING IN MY AREAIS DESTROYING T.V. GREYS ANATOMY IS MY FAVORITE SHOW ON T.V. THE ACTORSCOULD NOT BE ANY BETTER. THEY ARE THE ABSOLUTE PERFECT CHOICE TO PORTRAYTHE FANTASTIC CHARACTERS CREATED FOR THIS SHOW. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS SHOW IS NOT THE SHOW AT ALL. IT IS ALWAYS GETTING BUMPED OFF FOR SPORTS OR SOMETHING STUPID. THANKS TO DVD's I CAN WATCH AND FOLLOW THE STORY LINE WITHOUT GETTING RERUNS FROM LAST SEASON IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SEASON. THE THIRD SEASON IN MY OPINION IS JUST AS FANTASTIC AS THE FIRST TWO SEASONS. I AM REALLY SORRY TO SEE ADDISONS CHARACTOR GO, BUT REALLY GLAD TO SEE SHE WILL BE ON, WHAT I THINK, LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER SMASHSHOW, ""PRIVATE PRACTICE"". IF YOU LIKE THE SHOW, LETS KEEP THE RATINGS UP SO WE DON'T LOSE IT TO YET A N O T H E R REALITY SHOW!!"
1,"I really like the show !! The dvds were to be new,unused but......","I love the show.I am VERY displeased with the purchase as far as the quality of the items I received. I will NEVER purchase from this person again !! The DVD's were obviously USED and in poor condition. They look as though they were used as a ""fetch"" toy for a dog they are so scratched. The corners on the box were damaged and literature that comes with ALL Greys Anatomy dvds was missing. Great show. Poor seller !"
1,do not buy from this seller!!!!!,they didnt come until 3 weeks after i ordered them!! Plus the dvd's i got didnt play!!! they were copies that didnt work!!!do not buy from this seller!!
5,One of the best shows on Thursday nights,"Grey's Anatomy is definitely a must-see show for Thursday night viewing. This show is sexy, funny, emotional, and overall, a fun story. I recommend this show to everyone but suggest you start from Season 1. That way you can properly fall in love with the characters and the plots. Watch Grey's Anatomy, Thursdays at 9 pm on ABC!"
3,"I think this show has ""jumped the shark""","Grey's Anatomy is the only TV show that I consistently watch. I seem to prefer watching movies. I started watching Grey's during the first season and was hooked. The second season was just as good. But this third season, what did they do to us viewers? I had a hard time watching it. The writers, in my opinion were ruining the show. However, when I bought this DVD collection that opinion changed a bit. If you watch the DVDs they are as advertised, seriously extended and this was what I needed. Also it helps to not see any commercials. So this is a must for any Grey's Anatomy fan. I still believe the show ""jumped the shark"" this past third season. With Addison moving to a spin-off, Burke off the show and how the writers ""messed up"" George's character (would he really be with 2 women, much less cheat on his wife---that's not him) who could argue with me? I hope this season is better. The first show was good, but Addison and Preston Burke are surely missed."
3,Please bring back the humor,"While I have been an avid Grey's Anatomy fan and look forward to adding Season 3 to my collection, I hope that the writers return to the formula that has brought them so much success - the perfect blend of humor mixed with life's tragedies. That's what caught me in Season 1, and capitivated me in Season 2. Season 3 started very shakey (aka depressing), peaked in the middle and then fell flat with the final couple shows and the finale. I just hope it was a set-up for a rebirth in Season 4."
1,Season 3 was just bad.,"Season 3 has almost made me stop watching the show all together. By the end of the season all I could think is, why? And then they fired Isaiah Washington - and I again have to ask, why? It went from a bright, funny, teasing, gotta watch it show to...blah. I'll probably tune into it this fall just to see but - repeat 3? Why?"
1,Please Stop the Stupidity,"I was so disappointed and annoyed by Grey's season 3. I may sell my first and second season. I was soo annoyed with the whole Derrick/Meredith thing and by the end of the season I was ready to throw the TV out the window. WRITERS OF THIS SHOW -- Can you have Meredith grow a brain or since they are surgeons maybe they can give her a implant since obviously she doesn't have a brain of her own. Seriously...if your friends relationship can't work you don't need to end yours. I was also annoyed by Izzie, George, Callie, and the only person I enjoyed was Addison and now she's leaving. Will not be buying season 3 nor watching season 4. Don't even get me started on the fact that they are going to have Meredith's sister on there. Does anyone in Seattle go into any other specialty or aren't there any other good looking men besides McDreamy?"
1,The worst season of all,"I'm a huge fan of TV series and this year with big dissapointment I saw Grey's Anatomy go from good to bad to the worst tv I saw the all year. Even Lost who was not good at first ended in a superb way.I do not reccomend it for buying, pain enough was to watch it on TV ."
1,Oh so stupid.....,"This is really an annoying series. Ellen Pompeo (if that is her real name) can not act. No one in this show can act. They are annoying and they make Daytime Soap acting look like fine art by contrast, but no one hear can play one line of intelligent acting or dialoge for five seconds."
4,Tv at its best,"As far as the episodes go, I loved this show the second time around when watching the DVDs. I do feel that the bonus features were somewhat lacking. But other than that Great job."
2,Disappointing,"I have been a HUGE fan of this show since the beginning. Season Three was the biggest disappointment. Meredith was annoying, Izzie pissed me off continually (and she is usually my FAV character), they introduced the Addison spin-off which I don't think I'll watch because I like her on Grey's and wish she would stay. I'm trying to review this without spoiling the plot for those who haven't yet seen it.The season finale was depressing. And not the good-depressing like the end of Season Two. This one just basically caused me to lose hope in the characters and in the story. Will I keep watching? Yes (yet reluctantly, I'm sad to say). There's a part of me that hopes next season redeems itself. But this season was such a downer and really annoyed me more than anything. I wouldn't buy it."
2,What happen this season?????,"I love Grey's Anatomy!!!! Season I could watch forever. Season two, I know each episode by hard. But season three........WHAT HAPPENED?! I gave it a shot but the thrill I got in the first two seasons never came. I got tired of Derek and Meredith's ups and down. Christina and Burke gave me a headache. Izzy and George and Calley?????? Worst of all they left my girl Dr. Bailey out too much and she's the best actress on the show. I don't know but this season didn't do it for me. I'll probably get the dvd anyways because I'm still a GA fan but I truly hope season 4 makes up the the lapse in the prior season."
1,not a good season,"my wife and I enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, but season 3 was a waste of time. Sappy and unbelivable love stories."
1,pathetic,"The series went from amazing and addictive to dull and really pathetic. Somebody said is because they wanted to last their contract with ABC (is that a good excuse??) come on!! It seemed that Meredith was looking for excuses to keep suffering... and is just so boring!!. The medical dramas and situations were no longer original and it was like they kept going in the same over and over, same with all the relationships.... I was a real fan of the show ( I even found myself wishing the summer (2006) to finish so they release season three) I just got so deceived, I never ever watch it again..."
2,Worst Season....,This season really dragged for me...not near as entertaining as the 1st two. Too many things didn't fit with the characters.
2,"Loved first two seasons, but this...","Grey's Anatomy used to be my favourite show.. Intelligent dialog, witty storylines, interesting characters - all of this got ruined in season three.Instead of interactions between humans we get near death experience, ghosts and lots of gore. For me personally, one of the show's strengths used to be its concentration on individual characters - in season three I was treated to a boat disaster claiming tons of casualties.. More and bigger is not always better. After that came Gizzie..I hope the show is going to return to its former self in season four, as its creator recently promised in one of interviews. Until I am sure it is so, season three DVD box is going to stay in Amazon's warehouse."
4,TV is better on DVD,"I had watched Seasons 1 and 2 of ""Grey's Anatomy"" on DVD, and fully intended to watch Season 3 as it unfolded on TV. Three or four episodes in, I gave up -- the commercials made the shows drag, and the episodes seemed to lose momentum from week to week. However, I quickly completed the 3rd season on DVD, and I can honestly say the ability to watch one after the other (without commercial breaks) is a vastly rewarding experience. What might have seemed intolerable on TV (such as Izzie's moping at the beginning of the season) doesn't seem as drawn out when watched in succession. I find the show to be truly gripping television, but only when watched on DVD."
5,Pleased,"The discs were in great shape. The cases were broke here and there, but I did not purchase them for the cases. I am very pleased. Very reasonable price for used."
3,"Good show, scratched discs",This show is excellent and captivating as always. However I had a great deal of difficulty because the two of the discs were badly scratched. I ended up buying the episodes I was unable to watch off of amazon's Video on Demand. I highly reccomend Video on Demand from amazon.
5,This is what I demo my turntable to,"I just love her voice and the fat sound of the CBO. I don't really no what else to say, other than when someone wants to hear vinyl I usually reach for this or my Japanese pressing of Aja by Steely Dan. I know Wall of Sound is a Phil Spector trademark, but to me this orchestra really cranks out a wall of sound that just hits you in the face. One of the most (somewhat) overlooked singers out there."
4,pleasantly surprised,"I am not in the marketing or sales business at all. However, as a researcher who has to sell project ideas internally to management and externally to collaborators (mostly at management levels), I find this book surprisingly relevant, practical and to the point. Before this, I have attempted to read a few books on ""selling"" but was disappointed by the quality and cliche."
5,Value Forward Selling will move your career forward,"Value Forward Selling, Paul DiModicaThere are a few sales books that focus on selling to top management. None take the step-by-step approach that Paul DiModica does. This isn't a dull, text-heavy tome that will put you to sleep. Instead, Paul sets up selling situations and then shows the reader exactly how to function successfully in that situation. The greatest point made is one of attitude: How do you become a peer in the boardroom instead of a vendor waiting in the hall? Paul takes you through all the steps along the way to that enviable position.If you're in sales, you must read this book.Pam Lontos - President, PR/PR Public Relations"
1,Content as bad as Cover,"This book gives you a high level overview of how to sound like a vendor and get hung up on. There are a few worthy pages but that's all.If you want a serious sales book or training, check out Mahan Khalsa's ""Let's Get Real or Let's Not Play""."
5,Blisters on my Eyeballs!,"Got baptized under fire with A Better Tomorrow, Part 2... but then what? Especially now that Tower is starting to keep up a ""Hong Kong"" section, how in blue blazes do you seperated the phat from the fodder? This is a funny book; informative and hip without being slick. Hollywood, look out!"
3,A look at the cult side of HK films,"This book is only helpful for those with little knowledge of Hong Kong films. It's more playful than artistic, yet there are some helpful film reviews included. Some of the information is outdated: Web sites, where to buy HK films, etc..., but if your new to HK films and are interested in the pop culture gems that come out of Hong Kong, then check this book out. For those interested in a more in-depth look at Hong Kong films, I recommend City on Fire, by Lisa Stokes and Micheal Hoover."
1,Buy the book - No Need To See The Movies1,"I just dont get the appeal of this book, I'm sorry. For the most part, all it contains is a bunch of detailed plot information (yes Virginia, including key plot twists and endings) and very little information as to if the movies were any good! Yes, he has some special lists (""movies that rip""), but just not enough. I wanted this book as a reference to all of the HK movies out there, so I could see what was good before plunking down my cash on them - after reading about a few movies, I felt I no longer needed to buy them because I had already seen them. There are much better options."
1,Useless guide,"This has got to be the most useless movie guide on the planet. Basically, all it is a bunch of plot synopses of HK movies. They are not reviews, just summaries of all the plots, BEGINNING TO END. Half of the them don't even tell you if they are good or not! What on earth could possibly be the use for this? If I haven't seen the movie, I don't want to know EVERY SINGLE THING that happens in it before I see it. And if I have seen it, just reading the plot over is pretty useless too. Basically, the authors watched a ton of HK movies and decided that they should get paid for it, so they whipped up a book as fast as they could, without any consideration for how useful it might be, and put it on the market. Make them earn their dough like everyone else. Don't buy this book."
3,Helen Hunter starring in Twister,"This is a rather interesting movie about two stormchasers, chasing twisters in America. The plot was weak and the story-line was weak. I didn't really enjoy watching the movie. But if you have some spare time on a really, really boring day, it might not be so bad a watch."
2,Lame plot and acting is just the start,"The opening scene was pretty dramatic but it was all downhill after that. Twister lacks in the reality department. The chances of this group of storm chasers chasing so many tornadoes in such a short period of time is slim to impossible. Nobody would survive the ""gully tornado"". It sucked the truck up and it would also have sucked them up. Nobody, storm chaser or not, would get as close to F-3, 4 or 5 tornadoes as this group did unless they were on a suicide mission. Lastly, an F-5 twister (or any twister for that matter) has a forward motion (speed) of anywhere from 30 to 50 mph and Paxton and Hunt could have never outrun the storm, avoid debris from all directions or made it in time to tie themselves to some plumbing and hope to live. Special effects were good for the time period but that's where the accolades end."
4,Realistic now!!!,"I remember seeing this back in 1996 when it first came out, my wife loved it, & being a fan of Bill Paxton, I thought it was good, the special effects really blow you away, & you feel like you are in a tornado, but at the time, it seemed unreal from a logical stand point, I mean how many tornados can you encounter in a single day? well, now I can say this movie is real, I experienced this in Tennessee yesterday(4/7/2006) eight of them touched down here in Tennessee, & I personally witnessed one, & DO NOT want to again, I have a greater appreciation for this film now, it is real, it is as close to a real tornado that you will get if you haven't already, I did for the first time yesterday, & it was no fun!!, but this film is though!"
2,only worth one time seeing,"where should i start. well i love disaster films like these, alien invasions, killer asteroids, earth's core stopped working, 'n so on. but this turned out to be quite a disappointment altho it did have some decent scenes. so a tornado is chasing u (instead of u chasing it) and u just left ur truck flying into the monster. all of a sudden u run faster than the tornado????? this is the funny part actually. the guy and the girl (forgot their names) 'buckled' themselves up on a pipe with a leather belt and stayed alive to see the middle of the twister while it ran across 'em. okay now that's just going toooo far man. it's almost just stupid. not a very clever film. if u havn't seen it yet, borrow it from the library or ur friend. do NOT buy it. not worth the money"
3,Plot? What Plot?,"""Twister"" is a movie that serves the appetizers but not the main course. Throughout the movie, we're treated to some really cool special effects that capture the horror of a tornado. Winds blow, cars get turned upside down, and even cows get tossed about. Hands down, the twister itself should have gotten an award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The rest of the movie, however, is completely negligible. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton do little more than run around, looking scared and uttering lines of dialogue that never graduatre from the obvious. And the plot? It's basically an afterthought. Twister makes a decent if unspectacular DVD, though. Not only does the 5.1 mix rock the house, but thanks to the chapter selections, you can skip those boring parts that have tons of dialogue and go straight to the action scenes. ""Twister"" isn't a bad movie, but a very bland one minus the special effects. Recomended for die-hard action fans only; casual movie watchers should proceed with caution."
2,good movie,This is a good movie but i was buying it for a gift but there was a hole on the top plastic case and the packaging sticker was ripped open
5,Great Movie,"I LOVED TWISTER. BILL PAXTON AND HELEN HUNT ARE GREAT ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE! TWISTER TELLS THE STORY OF 2 DIVORCED TORNADO CHASERS THAT BUILT A MACHINE CALLED DORTHY TO CREATE AN ADVANCED WARNING SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE SO THEY CAN GET TO SAFETY IN TIME. THEY HAVE TO GET INTO THE TWISTER'S DEADLY PATH TO GET DORTHY UP INTO THE FUNNEL THOUGH. SO WATCH OUT. TWISTER IS HITTING YOUR HOME.I EVEN KNOW SOMEONE THAT IS IN THE MOVIE TWISTER. THE GUY WHO PLAYS RABBIT, MY AUNT USE TO GO TO COLLEGE WITH HIM AND I MET HIM. SO SEE OR BUY TWISTER TODAY! IT IS AN AWESOME MOVIE!Rated: PG-13 For Sequences of Bad Weather and Some Language.Running Time: 113 Minutes."
2,Predictable rubbish...,"This film is your typical Hollywood multi-million dollar pice o' crap made for summer. There is no compelling plot. There are only special effects. If effects are all you care about, fine ... buy it. If you want to think or enjoy a plot turn or well-developed characters, you don't have to read this review to know this isn't the film for you. This is the tipical insert-your-own-disaster-here attempt to entertain the masses. It's tired and hard to sit through. I give it a second star only because of ""the cow"" and good special effects."
2,The only thing 3-D was the Twister,"The one-dimensional characters were out of a cartoon book. What a disappointment! You would think that with Helen Hunt, there could be some character depth. But the ""B"" team was out in spades in this stinker - even the guy whose dad owned the expensive car in ""Ferris Buehler's Day Off"" was given a speaking part. And with Bill Paxon - well, you just know there's going to be a lot of hurt and angry looks, and a lot of running around, and no character development. And Cary Elwes of ""The Princess Bride"" showed up as the ""Bad Guy."" Someone came across these guys waiting tables and took pity on them. But at our expense. Shame! Next time give us some real actors with a real plot."
1,Extremely poor audio,"This is the WORST sounding blu ray audio i ever heard. is this a defective transfer or did i get a bad disk ? have HIGH end 805/Polk setup and Audio especially uncompressed sounds mind blowing but the audio here was worse than any standard dvd. very poor quality, could hardly feel anything not loud, no dynamic range,lfe or anything in either dolby truehd or regular 5.1. when things were flying and crashing in the tornado i barely heard anything... surely a problematic transfer or Quality control issueAbove average video"
2,Brainless,"This is a brainless film. Seriously, if you have anything approaching a decent IQ, avoid it. The plot seems like it was put together by monkeys pulling cliche after cliche out of a box.Early CG effects hold up decently. The gas tanker is probably the worst of the bunch, but still- good work there guys.Several likable actors. I don't know who to blame for this waste of time. I guess I'll choose the director for poor performances from the cast and the script writers for one of the worst plots ever."
5,best ever,this movie was watched till the vhs wore out so i had to buy it on dvd now that i am an adult lol
4,"Good Movie, Great Price","I'd seen the movie before and wanted to add the DVD to my collection. Priced at under 6 bucks, it was a great bargain."
4,It still is quite a ride,"This was my favorite movie when I was in Middle School. It still is a great movie I was glad to wait for the special edition dvd. When I was younger I was interested in becoming a storm chaser so this was quite a film. Now that I am older I think there are still some flaws with the movie, but that is ok. The movie was made for fun not for great writing. Some of the words storm chasers use people would not be familiar with, but I suggest people who want to learn more about weather go to the library. Anyway if you are looking for a film with great special effects this is the one."
3,Twister HD dvd,Looks and sounds great. really was Blown away by the way this looked and the sound was unbelivable. you will really enjoy this especially people that own surround sound.
4,Awesome special affects!,Great special affects! Twister is a great action film with all the drama in it for a wonderful movie experience!
4,NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE,"It's the special effects that are the star of this megahit; the script and performances are run of the mill, offering nothing extraordinary at all. But if you like a good disaster film, TWISTER delivers. Director Jan DeBont(Speed) keeps the action sequences tense and volatile, but the film bogs down when it tries to focus on the failed relationship of stars Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. Throw in Jamie Gertz and Cary Elwes in derivative roles as Paxton's new fiancee and his self-absorbed competitor, and you have the ingredients for standard disaster cum personal crises film. But who can argue with the awesome dynamics of the terrifying twisters; the flying cows; the eighteen wheeler oil tanker, and other SEs which permeate and validify this blockbusting movie, which has the honor of being the first movie released on DVD."
5,TWISTER,"HELEN Hunt...need we say more. We got this because we no longer have VCR (had the VHS TAPE). ACTION PACKED! COMEDY! Not a chick flick or a 'man's"" film. Just as I said, I don't mince words.Personal moments with a touch of comedy.........WOW!If you lived or heard of the tornado row.....this is soooooooo cool!"
1,A Mighty Bag of Duh,"Just to prepare anyone who might accidentally watch this: roughly 50% of the dialogue consists of the word ""hurry"" or the phrase ""come on"", combined in all their possible permutations."
1,Great movie - Horiable Blu-ray,Twister was one of my favorite movies until I bought on blu-ray. Now it is hard to watch because of how fake the sound and picture are.
4,twister blu-ray,"I find that movies not recorded in bluray in the theater tend not to look as good as movies made in the bluray format from the beginning,not a big difference between dvd's and a dvd re-recorded in the bluray format."
3,An Average Movie,This movie is way too overrated. It is not very exciting and it is too predictable. This movie could have been better.
5,Excellent Blu-Ray Version,They did an Excellent conversion to Blu-Ray.Good for my library of Favorite Movies!I am very happy with this movie.
4,Lets do the twist,"This movie has been around for years but only when it came out on Blu-ray did it peak my interest. Twister is a great mix of action, comedy, suspense, and just straight up corny-ness. Its the kind of corny that you can't turn away from for some reason. Almost like it was done that way on purpose. The tornado scenes are fantastic! The audio just begs to be played loud, and the picture just like most every blu-ray, is mind blowing. To sum this up quickly because I must get going, twister on blu-ray is a recommended addition to your blu-ray library. If you watched it on DVD or even on VHS way back in the day, then I suggest you revisit twister on blu-ray, and get twisted!"
5,A great movie from begining to end.,"I really enjoyed this movie from the start and there are very few movies I will watch more than once. This is one I will and have atleast 3 times. I felt the plot was good the characters were very believeable. The movie was able to keep my interest to the very end and most don't. Some of my other favorites are Men in Black, Independence Day, The Mask, Grease, Dirty Dancing to name a few. I hope this helps I really liked this movie."
1,Bad Nature Flick,"Twister is a film that relies mainly on special effects than plot. The usually good Michael Crichton seemed to mess somewhere along the way, adding to many stupid subplots. The special effects in this movie are great, but the stale acting is horrible and you just wish this movie would end. I thought Dante's Peak was a lot better."
4,GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!,I ACTUALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE.I THOUGHT THEY USED A NICE CAST ALSO.FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT DIDN'T LIKE THE MOVIE OH WELL!! MAYBE NEXT TIME THE WRITERS AND PRODUCERS CAN COME UP WITH SOME THING THAT YOU MAY ENJOY ONE DAY.BESIDES EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT TASTES AND OPINIONS ABOUT THINGS.
3,Nice Visuals but POOR sound.,"This is a great movie if you like unrealistic plots. One minute, a tornado is less than a mile away and the next minute, the sun is shining . . . Dumb. The visual effects are superbly done (probably Speilberg's doing) but the audio recording onto DVD is lousy. The rear channels are muffled and not much information is sent to them. The center channel is also a dissapointment. We all buy DVD's to get superb audio and sound but the dialog is completely lost is many scenes and you have to strain to hear what is being said. The Left and Right channels drown the center, even if you move the center channel volume up. The sound is disapointing, the visuals are nice, and the story is weak."
4,"Fun and excellent replay value, especially on DVD.","If you're looking for a smart action movie with actors that deserve Academy awards, this isn't you're movie. However, if you're looking for a fun, adventurous movie with great special effects and a decent storyline that will atleast keep you watching to the end, then Twister is one of the best. Hunt and Paxton not only convey the emotional danger behind the oncoming of the twisters but also, as stormchasers, display a giddy, child-like wonder for tornadoes. If you're watching on DVD, expect thunderous movie-theater sound that makes the fantastic twisters roar to life, which should add plenty of replay value to your movie. Also, selecting a particular scene to jump to will come particularly useful here, unlike some other DVD titles. If your the only one on the block to own a DVD player, this is a great title to show off. END"
2,So-so transfer to Blu-Ray,"Having waited eagerly for this to be released on Blu-ray, I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of the transfer. Not only is the Blu-ray not particularly crisp compared to the better transfers such as, say, Road Warrior, I established by A/B-ing the Blu-ray and previous non-HD version in my Sony PS3 that the Blu-ray is actually softer looking in some respects than the previous version. So you might save your money and just stick with the version you probably already have."
4,Twister on Blu Looks Cool,"I have always been a fan of this cheesy movie due to it's awesome special effects. It wasn't disappointing, the picture, the sound, the effects all look and sound great. I feel that it is a big improvement over the initial DVD release that was marred with artifacting and poor picture quality. If you own a Blu Ray and like this show it is worth adding to your collection. I feel I should mention that the extras here are not much to write home about."
4,Sound track,"I thought that the film was full of tension, not only the actual twister, but the lead pair. I am still trying to locate the sound track, here in England. I will keep on until I find it! The last song on the film is by Van Halen, respect the wind, a very apt title. I wonder if this was done just for the film? The music certainly added to the excitement of the film! Thank you."
3,Standard mindless Hollywood,"This is a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster. Lots of big effects, lots of action, and it's predictable. Really though, it's a fun rollercoaster ride. So long as you're not expecting anything else, then do yourself a favor and watch ""Twister"". It won't disappoint. Plus, it has a Star Wars reference in it, and any movie with a Star Wars reference ain't all bad.On the other hand, my eyes about rolled out of my head when I heard the tornado give a menacing growl! I thought, ""yeah, typical Hollywood...""But whatever. This is a fun, exciting movie and everyone should enjoy it. Plus, the soundtrack has two fantastic Van Halen songs, the last two of the Sammy Hagar era (which I was very sad to see end). All things considered, I give it 3/5 stars."
5,Great movie and great transfer,"One of my family's favorite movies and a great transfer in Blu Ray...great picture, great sound. Well worth the wait..."
2,"Great effects, laughable plot","Watch this one for the effects, not for the great acting.Uninspired acting by just about everyone, cliche after cliche in storyline."
2,The Weather Channel has more believable plots...,"This is a terrible, terrible movie. Stupid characters, junk plot, moronic dialogue, I really couldn't wait for it to end. I got dragged to see it, and I just remember, is this the best film that they can make? I remember Philip Seymour Hoffman was in this, and I wanted to belt his character with a shovel (or equally heavy instrument). All of the stormchasers are kinda idiotic, and if these people were real, they would probably be killed. The performances simply consist of Bill Paxton and crew getting debris thrown at them for 2 hours. People scream a lot in the film, too. It's just wretched. Watch the weather channel if you dig tornadoes."
3,Much different than watching it on broadcast TV,"I didn't much care for this film when I first saw it on broadcast TV, but the DTS version blew me away (along with the twisters). The special effects in DTS more than made up for the mediocre acting and rather inane plot. I didn't much care if the actors survived the tornadoes or not. Maybe when I watch it again, I will not be quite as taken away by the effects and return to disliking the film."
3,Twister Review,"O.K. So this isn't Lawrence of Arabia, but it achieves what it set out to do, and that is to provide entertainment. For 2 hours you can forget your world and just enjoy this popcorn flick. With great special effects and amazing sound, this is fun, fast and enjoyable, just accept it for what it is."
2,Dont watch it,Dont even watch Twister. Its kind of cool the first time you watch it but then it gets really boring. Its just about tornados.
1,the suck zone II,"In the movie, the twister destroys a drive-in while The Shining is showing on the screen. One could only imagine that this amounted to a review of The Shining. I don't agree with this review. The Shining is a very good movie."
4,"Good movie, but could of done better job on BLU-Ray transfer",This is a fun movie to watch but I could not tell too much difference between standard definition and high on this one. I do not think they spent to much time on the high definition mastering of this one.
3,"No plot, acting is okay, but the tornados are great!","You can fast-forward through the inane dialog, or turn the sound down and make up your own, the tornados are the stars of this movie. Some of the best ""special effect"" tornados I've ever seen. If you like tornados (as I do) it's worth watching."
2,Some of the best special effects you will see...,"...Other than that it was not all that great, Mediocre at best. The tornadoes are the best thing to come out of this movie, which is no surprise given it's title. Although Helen Hunt's acting helps, it's not enough to keep from noticing there is no plot or purpose. Helen Hunt is an excellent actress, just a shame her talent is almost wasted in this film. GRADE: C-"
2,Good thing I didn't waste my money...,"I didn't watch this movie in the theaters... and I'm happy. This movie is nothing but twisters and some people trying to chase them. I gave this album the extra star because the special effects are good, and the good stuff ends there. You'd be better off buying those National Geographic videos than watching Twister."
2,This movie is too overrated!,Twister is too predictable. I did not think the movie was good at all. Actually is was horrible!
2,This movie rides upon its effects,"Twister is a fairly decent movie. Whoever says the plot is great, stop and think: was there a plot? It played out like a soap opera. The interplay between the characters is stupid treacle, the ""script"" was probably written on the back of a napkin. They finally get the DOROTHY up in the tornado, becuase jeez, I didn't see that one coming. And the bad guys got what they deserved- death. Come on, they're doing it to earn a living instead for the ""love"" of weather. Watch it for the effects, like you watch Jerry Springer for the fights. Next time there's a thunderstorm, talk to someone while standing out in the rain and you can make a sequel....."
2,Worth only to watch the visual effects...,"This movie a couple of years ago was the first one that set the path for BIG NATURE CATASTROPHY movies with DARN EXPENSIVE special effects and MINIMAL common sense and TEPID actor performances. The visual effects send shivers down your spine, but unfortunately they make up only max. 30 minutes of the movie, so meanwhile you can take a nap, because sluggish romance between main characters is not persuasive, but there is nothing else in the movie, besides counting scenes that in real life would have killed our heroes: Well, if you don't know that NOTHING can survive after being crushed into the core of a tornado (yes, even if Ms. Hunt clutches the buttress of a bridge VERY TIGHTLY), you should watch CNN or DISCOVERY channel more often. From the point of view of true-to-life movie, ""Volcanoe"" was much better.."
2,"Good for one thing, Action. Not acting, not plot - action","Sorry folks, you may love the movie and you may, like me, even want to watch it over and over but it is NOT a great movie. The direction is marginal, the plot is poor and in Pan and Scan the movie is worth maybe one full watching and toss it but.... in DVD with Home Theater and Wide Screen the movie's only claim to fame, tornado power, shines. It is not that they tried to increase anyones knowledge of tornadoes, if experts were used much they must have been ignored alot, but the shear power displayed is exciting and thrilling to watch. This is one of the movies you buy to show off the system, not to watch from end to end. If you have a DVD, consider it, if you are considering it in VHS just head for the local rental place to satisfy your curiosity."
3,"Incredible Special Effects, Mediocre Plot","The special effects in this movie are incredible. You really feel like you are right their chasing the twisters. You even hear the sounds of the twister. This movie also showed me the power and devastation of tornadoes and how terrifying they are, for those caught in their path. The characters in this movie were likable, but I did not find the plot very interesting. However, I did enjoy this movie for the special effects."
4,Great showoff DVD for your home theater.,"This is a good DVD to pop in the player to show off your system to your friends. Being a ham radio operator & sometime storm chaser, this movie makes chase teams look like a bunch of clowns yelling into their CB radios. The groups I have been associated with are a lot more professional. Not particularly accurate as far as tornado behavior is concerned. How many people can run in a field & escape an F5 twister (ha)? But the special effects are really good & the soundtrack is awesome. Still worth the buy for the laughs."
5,You Will Rhu The Day You Miss Twister,"I have seen this movie so many times. I even taped it onto cassette so I can listen to it in my car. People call me ""Extreme"" just like Bill Pullman in the movie. That flying cow is sooo kewl. Makes me wanna become a storm chaser. The two Van Hallen songs in this movie, make it even better then the original, and a wet Helen Hunt, can't get any better than that. I am the greatest..."
4,Twister (HD-DVD),I wanted to add this great movie to my HD-DVD collection. I had an HD-DVD player before a Bluray and wanted a few of these HD-DVDs as these are now cheaper due to being obsolete.
5,"Not bad for a ""back in the day film.""","What can I say, Amazon always comes threw when it comes to the prices. The product was in its original packaging and in great condition when arrived. Not to mention this is a great film."
3,Showing its age,"Seemed really good when I first saw it, but even my 10 year old found it a little boring. Helen Hunt does a great job, and I often wonder why she didn't have a bigger career."
3,"Entertaining, but a little repetitive.","This movie was a blast. It was fun to watch and it was very entertaining. If you can, check it out on DVD, the digital sound mix is definately something you can use to show off your sound system. The only problem I had with this movie was the fact that the plot seemed to keep repeating: Go out and get tornado, almost get killed, survive. That is mostly the movie, and there is a side love story. Here is an interesting gripe, when they are 20 feet away running from the tornado, their hair isn't even blowing! I guess CG tornados can't do that.Still, great special effects, good fun, and good entertainment. Reccomended for action buffs."
4,The DTS version rocks the home theater!,"This is the first disc I bought since I got the home theater set up and this one you won't believe! Ok, I'll admit the story here is a little weak, but this isn't supposed to be a ""Raging Bull"" type of character study. This is a very entertaining, state of the arts effects, fun film. The sound from this DTS version is extraordinary. The separation of the 5.1 is incredible. The twister sequences will blow you away. You feel the sound and the fury! The only other disc that compares is the Saving Private Ryan one. For you home theater fanatics, this is your film.. you'll see it, hear it, and feel it. This disc also has some great extras like director commentary and a cool documentary of how it was made. All in all, it's not one of the finest 100 or 200 movies ever made, but you may find yourself watching it over and over for the experience of it! You'll love it! The movie itself is about a 3, but the DVD DTS is about a 5!"
5,The movie Twister,I absolutely love about how this DVD has plenty of special features for me to enjoy including two previews of it.
4,Good Movie,I nice action adventure movie to sit down and watch with your entire family. Kids of all ages can enjoy this and you do not have to worry to much about foul language or inappropriate material for your younger children.
3,Twister good for effects!,"Welp, we all know that Twister has no strong plotline, but the special effects and acting (With what they had to work with) made up for it. This movie grabed my imagination due to it's score. By as I say over and over, ""Special effects don't make movies, they help them along."" I need to say Twister wasn't a very good movie. But most movies with no plots are boring, this wasn't. So I give it a couple of stars for that. At least it wasn't just special effects and bordom like Armageddon!"
4,Poor Picture Quality,"While I LOVE the movie...the DVD 1st edition of Twister had a really poor picture quality despite the 4 out of 5 stars it received on the top of this page. Hopefully the special edition will have a cleaner picture. There was terrible ""digital distortion"", those annoying block type things that you see when you watch something on your Real Player online. I must say I am really disappointed with the early Warner Bros. DVDs!"
3,"Good, but not Great","The special effects were awsome---the plot not so great.Okay movie, but deffinatly just a renter. Helen Hunt is extremely good in this movie however and if you're a fan it is a must-see. My rating of 3 stars is more of a personal rating--I am into Horror (hey, I'm a teen!) verse action."
4,Twister was good....but.....,"Twister was a really good movie. The special effects of twisters and their effects were good. However, I was disappointed in the fact that too much of the movie concentrated on the love relationship between the 2 stars."
1,Stay Away - Not Blown Away,"This movie pegs the ""Oh-Yea-Sure"" meter way to often. I can't think of anything good to say about it."
1,What a Disappointment,"This would have to be one of the worst movies I have seen. Both the story and acting if you can call it that are poor to say the least, with only the sound and special effects deserving any credibility. A total disappointment.This text refers to the DVD edition"
1,These twisters ...,"I had probably forgotten the story line of this movie before reaching the parking lot of the theater where I watched it. What I can still recall are the Hollywood-ized, utterly fake encounters with the ""tornadoes"". Absolutely everything about the storms themselves and the science of storm chasing was grossly inaccurate. From the Kenmore ice cube tray hailstorm to the ""green sky"" nowhere near an active thunderstorm, to the individual plucking of fence posts (how does wind impinge such an upward force on a paralell-aligned object fixed to the ground?) to the moment-by-moment predictions that the tornado is going to turn left or right, to the chasers riding alongside a tornado in an effort to have intercourse with it, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. Nothing was even close to reality.Tornadoes are a fascinating subject. There are plenty of videos featuring REAL storm chases. Start (and end) your search with those types of videos."
1,the suck zone,"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a remake of The Wizard of Oz. Boy what a letdown. Come to think of it I had the same experience watching Zardoz.While watching this movie, it became clear to me that ""actors"" are people who have been randomly selected to get in front of a camera and pretend to do things. The characters say things like, ""these satellite readings have increased in the last ten minutes"" ""Keep monitoring this pattern"" ""Ok"" Then there is a tossing aside of sodas and a melee of excited, riot-like running toward vehicles. Then there is more dialog, like ""We're not going to be able to intercept!"" ""No, we will. Hang on!"" ""Are you out of your mind?""""We gotta get outta here!"" ""I know!"" This last dialog is screamed over the sound of lots of wind. The movie appears to be about a weather phenomenon wherein lots of wind causes a general sucking effect: the script sucks, the acting sucks, the effects even pretty much suck."
5,Please bring it back,"I completely agree with everyone - This is the best product on the market for curly hair. Since I have stopped using the product, my hair looks terrible. I had to scrape the bottom of my purse to purchase this gel for $10 - Unbelievable!! I decided to write a letter of complaint to Loreal (address below). If everyone takes some time to address a complaint to the President, perhaps they will consider bringing the product back. Those of us with curly hair are consistently overlooked in the haircare market.L'OREAL USA, INC.,Carol Hamilton, President575 Fifth AvenueNew York, New York 10017,"
2,L'Oreal Curl Gel did not work for me,"I like the newer L'Oreal version for bouncy curls and still keep the Garnier Fructis Curl Construct and one of my favorites. Like Tigi Foxy Curls, Samy Curl Definition, and Marc Anthony for curls."
5,Far Beyond the Traditional,"""Abandoned Autos"" examines some of the subtleties of American automobile culture. The photos contained in this work range from vehicles rediscovered in farmers' fields, to several with trees growing through the engine compartment. Such photos are then contrasted wth corporate promotional literature from when the vehicles were new. Excellent stuff for readers who are lured by the path less travelled and can appreciate the beauty and even sadness embodied in these cultural icons depicted well past their prime."
4,AUDREY MAKES IT WORK,It just shows the difference when Audrey Meadows is Alice!! No one like her and it works!!! The Ones with Sheila MacRae werea terrible Gleason mistake!! This is Fun and typical Story!!! Shame on U Mr.Gleason for not using Audrey.....ALL THE TIME!!!
1,Dirty stuffing,"I really wanted to like this product but had to return because after the first wash before use, I noticed the bunny head stuffing leaked brown colored liquid, turning the head dirty yellow and leaving a brown ring on the body part. If my baby sucks on it, he would have ingested whatever the brown juice is. This product is not safe for a baby!"
3,Larger than Expected,"My nephew has a lovie from Under the Nile (which he loves - and is no longer offered) and I bought this bunny for my third baby hoping it would be similar to my nephews lovie. Unfortunately, the bunny's head is much larger than I was hoping (about 2 to 3 inches diameter). I think the lovie my nephew has is loved because it has a small head and knots and is easy for him to grab and hold. I was disappointed this bunny is so much larger than I was hoping.It is very soft and washes well, true to Under the Nile products. The blush color is exactly the same as other blush colored Under the Nile products (a bit more muted and blush in person and not quite as clear pink as appears online). I think this will still end up being a well loved toy, but I don't think interest will start as early because it's just too big for a small infant to start grabbing."
3,Cute but a little big for Toddlers,The head size of the bunny is about 2 inches. It is very cute but I think it was a little big for toddler.My 1 yr old didn't care for it. (she still like her thumb over any dolls).
2,Disappointed and bored,"Finally watched the Josée Dayan's Les Liaisons Danngereuses, only PART ONE, rather disappointed and bored!Catherine Deneuve is simply unfit and inconvincing to be the great manupulator Madame de Meurteuil, so much so far way behind Glen Close. The plot of this much adapted novel is already familiar to a lot audience, we need a much beyond fame and beauty screen goddess who can pull it ""agefully"". Say Cher?I could save some energy for PART TWO though for the continuous charm of Rupert Everett, and ah, those lovely backdrops of French country too."
2,Pas assez.,"Je trouvais ce film bien réalisé, Catherine Deneuve est ""trop"" comme la salope maline et séduisante. Son rle est semblable à celui qu'elle jouait dans ""Belle de Jour"" il y a 30 ans. Voilà pourquoi il est tellement dommage que l'histoire originale par Laclos ne se soit pas achevée. A la fin du film on a l'impression qu'il aurait d tre un autre rouleau.Ivas Morgan"
1,Awful ... do NOT buy this,"I got this for $7 CDN at Walmart. I figured, ""How bad could it be?"" Well, I wish I had my $7 back. I knew the songs would probably be live recordings, but these are some terrible sounding versions of some great songs. Not just the recording quality, but many of the songs are not even listenable due to the screaming / screeching of the crowd (of mostly teenage girls at this point in Elvis' career).Horrible, don't waste your money, regardless of how cheap it is!"
3,still missing alot of games,"when it has games that you play its great but when it doesn't(alot of racing games)then it is useless! I guess I throught it would do more then it did,waste of money for me"
5,dr jekyll and mister hyde,"i thought the 1932 version had more depth to the hyde character than the tracy version but would not state that either was not worth viewing. i think getting these 2 fairly hard to find titles at such a great low price,make this disk a must have. and dont forget the bugs bunny as dr jekyll/ hyde bonus!!!"
5,Truly Outstanding!,"As a huge fan of the book and musical Jekyll and Hyde, this movie is the best! Spencer Tracey delivers an all-star performance as Jekyll and Hyde. For anyone who loves this classic story, this is the movie to see."
3,3 Stars For The 1941 Version,"Although I thought it was good, Spencer Tracy in the 1941 version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde is not as good as the l932 version with Fredrich March. I found it unusual that the character was called ""Harry"" instead of ""Henry."" The make-up of Mr. Hyde was not very scary, unlike the hairy Frederich March. They put a lot more effort into the end of the film than the rest of the movie."
5,Classic !,"The Fredric March's version ( Paramount,1932 ) directed by Rouben Mamoulian is a classic of the history of american film.Beautifully photographed by Karl Struss and with an unforgettable interpretation by March , for which he won an Academy Award.The 1941's version with Spencer Tacy in the leading role ( roles)and Victor Fleming as director , with a good film score (by Franz Waxman ) ,is a deception.The best story about the 1941's version has as protagonist the british writer Somerset Maugham. When on the set of Victor Fleming's Dr.Jekyll & Mr. Hyde , seeing a scene with Tracy ,asked :"" Who is he playing now : Jekyll or Hyde ? "" ."
2,AWFUL..BORING..DID NOT KEEP ME INTRESTED AT ALL!!!,"I THOUGHT IT STINKED! I ACCIDENTIALLY GOT THIS VERSION INSTEAD OF THE ONE WITH SPENCER TRACY AND LANA..INGRID, AS I PREFERRED IT MORE THAN THIS ONE..I CANT EVEN DESCIBE IT BUT THIS ONE IS A FLOP! SORRY FRREDRIC!"
1,Another substandard waste of plastic,"All of these movies are already available on their own single DVD. Why would anyone simply cram a random bunch of horror films on to 2 DVDs & repackage them as a new product? With landfills overflowing & the ability to stream the movies online readily available, it is a complete waste to put these out again in a substandard package. If you're going to do it, do it right, namely HD remasters in 1080p on blu ray & perhaps some bonus material not previously included."
2,Just sickening,"Sure all the movies on there are great, and wow what a chance to get them all, but come on, this is absolutely sickening. The ultimate gift for the movie buff? With the list price of 4 grand, and the Amazon price at a grand and a half, it'd be cheaper to slap the movie buff who puts this on his xmas list. Seriously, there's no way anyone who buys this can say the economy's bad if they've got 1.5 thousand dollars to blow on something so meaningless. I'm for splitting that package up into about 4 or 5 sets, lower the price and viola! You're not a glutton for buying one of them at a time. Perhaps I'm the only one in this consumer day and age who doesn't find this to be a deal of the century, but rather one of the sickest displays of commercialism I've seen."
2,It's ok....I guess...,"but come on...there's not ONE David Lynch film here, not ONE John Waters film here, not ONE film by the Cohen Brothers, and, where's films like FAT GUY GOES NUTZOID or BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA? Where's the movies from the Big Dwarf Rodeo? Ok, I suppose, if you've got the scratch to drop, and the hours upon hours to spend to watch some of these hacknied movies, then knock yourself out."
4,Same discs as individual releases,"For those hoping this new package set would contain remastered prints or new material, look elsewhere. These seem to be the exact same content as the previously released individual editions of each film, except rendered on 2 double-sided discs (This means that the 1933 film Mystery in the Wax Museum, which originally appeared on the flip-side of House of Wax, is not found here, even though they forgot to remove reference to the film from the House of Wax menu screen!)All films are presented in original aspect ratios (meaning only The Haunting is widescreen). Trailers, commentary tracks and supplemental material from the initial releases of The Haunting, House of Wax and Freaks are carried over here."
4,Dr. eckyl and Mr Hyde DVD,The quality of the two films were excellent. Just thought the overall content was a bit weak. Certainly worth the cost of the DVD.
3,spencer tracy!!!!,very good movie!!! spencer tracy and ingrid bergman are astonishing!!!!!we are jekyll and hyde ourselves!!!!!!it's about drug taking that changes our personality!!!!!
3,Age Withers Classic,"This review is of the l933 Rouben Mamoulian version with Frederick March. I was horrified to see that this DVD transfer is so botched. It's filled with scratches, grain and the version I taped ten years ago from PBS is far superior. While this version is still fascinating to watch, you begin to ask questions. Why did the director plaster March with so much make-up BEFORE the transformation? He wears weird black lipstick and eyeshadow in his normal stages. When he does transfer, he becomes so ape like you have to wonder why everyone didn't run for the hills when they saw him coming? Which is why I found it hard to believe Ivy would spend one second with him--much less becoming his mistress. Still, this is the best version of them all and one hopes that one day a restored, cleaned up version will be available on DVD."
2,What can I say?,"The film is cinematically fluent enough, thoroughly professional, and it is obvious to see why the great Frederic March won an Academy Award for this. But I have to admit to being tremendously let down by this film for an infuriating reason: it was unintentionally hilarious. ""Jekyll & Hyde"" is just one of those stories that I HAVE to take seriously to feel the terror. But how can you be terrified by a villain who is a Jerry Lewis ""Nutty Professor"" clone? I suspect that Hyde turned out so unwittingly like a grotesque doofus because of the recent success of ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein""; so some priggish makeup man, left to his own devices, recreated a corrupt image of his taskmaster tutor. I'm sorry, but I am now convinced that the famous novel has never approached success on the Hollywood screen!"
5,TCM movie pack,I love the movies it came with.. Some real old classics.*House of Wax 1953 with Vincent Price..*Freaks*Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde*The haunting 1963The haunting is a very hard movie to get so for the price you get all these movies. If you love old classic movies then this is the purchase for you.. There are tons of movies so see under TCM.. Love all these movies ..
4,Good for English class,"I teach English 1 to high school freshman. After letting three classes view both the 1932 and the 1941 version, the kids overwelmingly agreed the 1932 version was better. They couldn't really see a difference in appearance between Jekyll and Hyde in the 1941 version. And, being able to really see when the doctor was Jekyll and when he was Hyde helped them ""get"" the story better. The 1941 version also moves a bit more slowly.There is also a Bugs Bunny short ""Hyde and Hare"" that my kids really enjoyed. It was a nice 5 minute recap of the story for them. Of course, it was also important to point out that though both movies had an Ivy character, the book did not..."
4,A great beginning,"As a big movie buff and collector, and a big Warners fan, this is a great collection. God knows that I have spent more than $1500 collecting movies. Some people have criticised the cost, but, this is clearly designed for people like me, who are big collectors. Spending $1500 on this is no different than people who spend $1500 on a Steiff animal or porcelin dolls.The only disappointment is that Warners has YET to put the movie that really made Warners a major player on DVD, The legendary ""Jazz Singer"" with Al Jolson. that one disc would complete my collection of the AFI top 100 films of all time. I'm really missing that classic. So, please Warner, if you see this, release the great 1927 classic and complete my collection."
4,Strange but familiar,"I didn't even know the story, just the basics which are all though society. So......It was a well-crafted story, and this film version of it was quite superb. Thanks for the opportunity to buy it, and at a bargain price!!!!!!"
5,This Book must be read!,"The Everglade's descriptions are fabulous. Only someone that has been there can only describe the Florida Everglades as well as Mr. Carballo does in this book. I loved reading the novel about the two boys that go on a ""Huck Finn"" adventure through the streets of Miami. There is great deapth in this story as in all great books. I'll be waiting for the next one!"
4,4 packs of generic cigarettes for demos last show,"home movie/80s concert lighting and camerawork.the first half is a home video of gbv rehearsing for original bassist greg demo's last show on their porch with various dayton characters milling around including conversation and songs from the always stellar geo,who gives the world the title of the dvd in a snappy rant of gbv folklore.the second half is of the concert that night.the lighting is red and blue and the quickpaced editing feels like 1989 but its a good show and bobs smashed and demos pulls out all the old rock moves and plays his heart out.theres also more home movie footage of the guys hanging out after the show and bob stumbles all the way home with his head down.it might not be airbrushed and tailor made to hypnotize a tv audience into liking it but isnt that what gbvs all about?if you keep it real and know what real really is,this dvds for you."
2,Disappointed fan,"I have always been a big fan of GBV. After seeing them live close to 15 times and loving every show, I was excited to see that they had a DVD coming out. The quality is really bad. Half of the DVD is a jam session on someone's porch and the other half is a live show. I would recommend the VHS video ""Watch Me Jumpstart"" over this without question. Bob Pollard still rules anyway (if you are a musician and want to see what the band is playing, the scenes on the porch might be useful to you)."
1,Give me my money back!,"What were GBV thinking when they allowed this garbage to be released? I mean, I know they are a prolific band and have a tendency to release iffy material, but enough already. This dvd is a travesty, plain and simple. The only time I smiled at all while watching the main program is the moment from which the movie is named. One last question: why is the bonus material more professionally recorded then what is presented in the main program? Not that it fares much better, but it at least would garner two stars. Since it's anchored to the big piece of lead that is the main program, however, the resulting dvd gets a one."
5,The best album in the world!,"When I first saw Puressence live I instantly fell in love with their music and this album is a beautiful follow up to their first album. From the primal drumming and smooth vocals in ""sharpen up the Knives"" to the soothing melancholy ""Gazing Down"" this album will leave you tingly from start to finish (and if James Mudriczki's vocals don't get you tingling I don't know what will!). My recommendations for people who haven't heard them before is listen to ""It Doesn't Matter Anymore"" it'll have you hooked!"
4,"Gentle sound, but westerized","This is a nice CD, very listenable, but I would disagree that it is zen influenced. It has more native american undertones, and lacks the eastern scales and silent spaces that typify zen music. It is clearly composed by a western writer. This is not to say it isn't an enjoyable CD. It is, just dont expect the eastern flavor."
5,The Ultimate Guide to Conservative Worldview,"""The Conservative Mind"" made a bigger splash than anyone expected when published. By pulling together the thought of great conservative thinkers from across the ages, Kirk conclusively proved that a philosophy of conservativism did exist and that it was a worthy alternative to the once-dominant liberal line of mid-twentieth century America. That may not sound like a spectacular feat, but at the time many wondered whether there was any such thing as a conservative mind, much as many now wonder whether an evangelical mind exists. Because Kirk mines centuries rather than decades, this is a book that doesn't go out of style."
2,"Good writer, bad communicator","Kirk is a ""good writer"" but an appalling communicator. Instead of just saying what he has to say, clearly and simply, his passages read as if they were a puzzle to be solved. Fancy words, obscure references, half-made hints and suggestions - it quickly becomes irritating.I get the feeling that Kirk wants to impress us with his intellect. But any writer that leads with his ego is in trouble, and this is a fine example."
3,The Conservative Mind,"The introduction with the six ""conservative principles"" is a brilliant definition of conservative political thought. Like some of Kirk's other books, this remains a bit unclear. Kirk doesn't seem to care about essential political issues and differences. For example, the differences between Burke and Disraeli. And disraeli's social policies - although an essential part of geniune conservatism - seems a bit embarrasing for parts of the American conservative opinion. (By some reason, I'd guess that many - at least in America - who would regard themselves as ""conservatives"" - would have much more in common with Liberal Gladstone than ever with Conservative Disraeli. Gladstone was a laissez-faire liberal, anti-imperialist, pro-democrat, and a Christian moralist...)"
1,The conservative mind: overrated and dull,"Every true conservative knows the Conservative mind. It had a enormous impact in 1953 and is still very respected. In my opinion it's overrated. The book is dull; Kirks style is uninviting. He keeps repeating the same slogans over and over again: religion is the basis of all society, there must be order and the left is demolishing the world. I advise you just to read the introduction with its famous canon of conservative tought. That will do. Kirk is only interested in explaining his own philosophy and that's why every conservative seems the same in this book. Take for example Edmund Burke. No word about the liberal part of his political philosophy or the inconsistency between his common sense epistemology and his christian metaphysics. If you want to read a good book on American conservatism, I would advise Conservatism revisited by Peter Viereck."
2,Fulsome and repetitive,"I tried. Really, really tried. I'm tired of hippies whining, so, I thought, I'd give this book a try. Fulsome. Repetitive. I love Burke and know him well. This book actually made me dislike him. Let me save you the trouble. The gist of conservatism: oppression good, education bad, allahu akbar...that, too. also."
5,Great wipers,"This is an excellent product, without a doubt. I have been suffering lousy wipers that screeched and stuttered across my windshield, leaving behind streaks for a couple of years. I tried many other brands, including the fancy stuff from Tripledge and RainX, but none of them worked as well as these Trico Teflon blades. I hope they hold up through a couple of seasons.I am a little puzzled about Amazon's shipping practices. They sent everything in my order in separate boxes, each the size of a bread box; I bought 4 blades plus one other item, and they came in 5 very large boxes. One of these boxes would have been enough to hold all 5 items that I ordered. If Amazon had shipped them all in 1 box, they would have saved themselves a lot of money, and wasted a lot less cardboard and packaging. There must be more cost effective way for Amazon to ship stuff."
2,interesting to install,Ordered these thinking they would be easy install. Well after trying the two different adapters that came with the blades I finally figured out that to put these on my trailblazer I needed to take the old adapter from my discarded blades and use them for these to fit on the wiper hooks...GEESH would have been nice if the instructions said you may have to do that!
1,Worst wiper blades,These are the worst wiper blades I've ever had. They chatter and streak all the time and froze up badly in freezing rain making a dangerous driving situation worse. Do not buy these blades.
2,Ad misleading,"Ad was misleading, part number was different than the picture. I was thinking I was ordering winter blades, but instead I received summer ones."
2,It left a gap where water stayed on window,"The gap was a few inches wide out near the end, very annoying. I actually replaced it already with a refill for the old blade, but that one isn't perfect either.It was difficult to install, but that is because the directions were hard to understand and I was doing it wrong. If it isn't going on easily, try to reinterpret the instructions. There are two different types of hooked shafts."
3,"""1""","I only bought this CD for one song so I cant really speak for the whole album, but this CD contains the hard-to-find underground hit ""Sanctified Lady"". This is one of my ALL TIME favorite songs ever!"
3,Rolfs Townsman Wallet,"Rolfs Townsman Flip Fold WalletThis type of wallet goes back many years and is especially useful for carrying a maximum number of cards because it doesn't have a layer of leather between each card.Earlier models had much better craftsmanship which resulted in a more comfortable fit in the owner's pocket. Hence my three star rating.Nevertheless, no other manufacturer to my knowledge offers this type of high capacity wallet today.We certainly are required to carry more and more cards with each passing year, and no single wallet holds more cards than the Townsman, in my opinion."
5,A hidden Gem of a series,"Get small snippet of Aussie life at a time when alot of big stars today were just starting out.....Great cast, great performances....a hidden GEM of a series"
1,More like Brides of Frankenstein,"I was excited to watch this movie and thought, from the title, that it would be enjoyable. I couldn't have been more wrong. This was a horrible and innaccurate portrayal of religious life,and one thing is clear in the movie and that's the anti-Catholic bias of the movie makers. This movie was about as enjoyable as a root canal.I hated this film and I urge everyone who might consider watching it to avoid it."
3,Portrait is the Best Cut!!,"I've always liked Lees' stuff. Portrait is by far the best cut on this CD. Rio, Westbound and Rit I play over and over. Love this guy:)"
3,Daivd and Gillian,"The magazine is used, but it's is in great shape even it is used. Held together good, no pages falling out. And did you know it is Daivd and Gillian together in bed not Mulder and Scully, because Chris Carter didn't want Mulder and Scully together in bed with each other.But fans from the show they did sleep together in season 7 ep called ""All Things"" that Gillian Anderson wrote and direct."
5,One of the finest bass players,John Patitucci is one of the best bass players in the world. I like this album because it is smooth. He also has a great back-up band. I give it a five.
5,Frank Gambale wails on this CD,If you like the guitar work of Frank Gambale - he's great on this CD!
3,Not for beginners or owners of 4 shaft looms,"Although the ideas look really neat, there are not many uses for someone with a 4 shaft loom (like me). More stuff for 8 shaft owners. I think some of the ideas could be adapted, if one were an experienced weaver. Certainly doubleweave is a technique that some might like to attempt, but this is not the book to start with."
2,Didn't perform like described.,"This product was a waste of money. Arrived quickly, but didn't work. Took it to a parts store thought maybe the battery inside was bad. They said it needed to be programed. There were no instructions for the ""do it yourself"" programming. Took it too a dealer. They couldn't even figure out how program it. Worthless piece of plastic this turned out to be. Ugh>_<. Really disappointed. On a good note, though don't have that car anymore; so no longer a problem..."
3,Dont get it,Save your money. I replaced these with some smittybilt gear covers a few weeks later. These are cheaply made. Learn from my mistake
2,A mixed bag,"I purchased two of these chairs for my living room. Visually, I found them very attractive and they look quite nice in the room. Sitting in them is another story. These chairs are very uncomfortable! First the seat cushion are hard, like concrete. You might as well be sitting on the floor. So I went to the expense of refilling them with new, custom padding. Cost me $50 each. That problem was solved, but the backs of these chairs are too upright. You almost have the feeling of falling forward when sitting in them. So I changed out the back cushions and replaced them with something softer, with a bit more ""give"". It helped, but I'm still not thrilled with how the chairs feel.I contacted the seller to see if I could return them (prior to replacing the cushions) and never received a reply. So I'm stuck with them and although they look nice, I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
1,Kindle users avoid this version,"Though it's only a few dollars, the Kindle version of this must-have book does not include a table of contents! Unless you want to read the 1000 page book from cover to cover, avoid this version."
2,To heavy for me,"I just couldn't get into it. It ws putting me to sleep. There is no question, Ralph Waldo was a smart and talented person, but he lost me in this book. I figured if Woody Hayes read it, it had to be good."
2,Not good Formatting on Kindle,I didn't like the formatting on the Kindle. You would be best buying a hard copy. I deleted it after several attempts at making sense of it.
3,essays,I love reading the essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson. I keep this on my Kindle to go to for my feelings on any given day and I always find an essay that relates. I purchased this not to read at one time but through out the year.
2,For Crawford fans only !,This so-so film is absolutely not a film noir and is boring and silly.I give two stars simply because it has Dana Andrew in it.I cannot stand Crawford but Her fans will love it !I thought Andrew and Fonda could save it.....NOPE !
2,It's Joan wearing,"a mink coat. Angst ridden over Henry Fonda and Dana whats-his-name. Haven't we seen this before with other men? She's torn between the two, but of course, she's some sort of artist and can withstand the agony. Haven't we seen this before with other men? Until she flips over a car in the snow and walks back through the snow, THROUGH THE SNOW (this is tough going, and she's wearing a mink coat and that's the end of that; it's Crawford, no need for police and all), and the besotted Fonda and Dana whats-his-name comfort her. She's torn. I think somewhere in the film she drinks a cup of tea. I'm not sure.I'll have a scotch, thank you very much."
4,Movie Daisy Kenyon,"For a fan of Joan Crawford, which I am, the movie was fun to watch again. I liked the city scenes, as well as the scene of Provincetown. I recommend it for Crawford fans,"
3,"Very boring,but since it has Joan Crawford","The only reason to see this film is for Joan,amazing just like everything else she does. This isnt a typical ""Film-Noir"" in terms of crime and susepense,but on terms of lighting,its definatley a 'Noir',this movie is really boring,but is overall an ok drama,i just wish she had done more films with twentieth century."
2,Very bland,"I read this book with the hope of getting some insight into Astaire's personality and non-showbiz life, but was disappointed. I found nothing other than a Wikipedia-type recreating of the highpoints (and occasional lowpoints) of his career. Perhaps this was not a suprise, given that it was an autobiography. However, some autobiographies provide this material. Try reading Oscar Levant's Memoirs of an Amnesiac for a better read. Hopefully, a more complete book on Astaire's life and career will follow."
3,Fred Astaire reinvents himself!,"He writes about his life like he tap dances, with precision nd craft, but what is missing is any real feeling or emotional reaction to his wonderful life. Maybe because he did have a wonderful life?"
2,Disappointing....,"Not worth the four year wait. The production is brittle and overwrought, and some of the songs are downright sappy.Jason should have chopped this down to about four songs and released it as an e.p. Stick with Lazer Guided Melodies or Pure Phase."
1,Stinko,"Simply awful...overblown, pretentious, totally lacking in merit. Combining the worst elements of 70's prog rock (Emerson, Lake and Palmer springs to mind) and 00's digital noodling, this aimless, meandering mess is nothing short of painful to listen to. It's quite apparent that The Man had no idea what to do with all the srings, horns and classical claptrap to which he had access, and the result is a musical train wreck: sound and fury, signifying nothing. After ""Ladies and Gentlemen..."", this is a huge disappointment. It has been described as ""challenging"", but unlistenable is more like it. After repeated spins, there is not a single track that sticks in my mind; the whole sloppy concoction bogs down under its own weight, like a herd of epileptic elephants in a tar pit. Shame!"
3,mmmm..... Lupine Howl was better,"Although, the lord knows the anticipation for this album probably brought it up to an un attainable level for any album to reach. I will have to admit that I felt twinges of dissapointment with this. I appreciate the work that went into this, I've read about how he orchestrated the whole album and he can't even read music so he had to hum each part and find the note on a piano, but it just comes out sounding like the new Mercury Rev album part 2.I thought that the album from LUPINE HOWL, which has the ex-members of Spiritualized was a much more exciting album. It has the other worldly elements of Spiritualized that I loved in the first place, but with a bit more of a rock edge infused with it. Definitely check out their Full length"
1,Very Unimpressed,"Spiritualized was recommended to me as being better than Radiohead. When I listened to Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space I was impressed. However, this album just ruined it for me. I thought I stepped into a christian rock concert and have to admit this album lacks much of what the previous Spiritualized albums had, a good sound. I recommend LAGWFIS, but stay away from this one. They have a long way to go be as good as radiohead, they might be able to open for them i concert though."
1,Dude!,"This album sounds like some bad second coming of the Moody Blues. I'm not sure how much further Jason can sink. Maybe Celine Dion or Meat Loaf will appear on his next album. The use of strings and gospel here creates a patchwork of conventional forms used with the kind of overt manipulativeness of the worst kind of commercialism. This isn't a bunch of musical elements working organically together to build up the architecture of songs: it's a bunch of canned cliches laid over dull riffing and juvenile lyrics; it's taking a short cut to affecting music through the cynical use of accepted registers of seriousness (this is ""orchestral,"" ""orchestral"" equals high art; this is ""gospel,"" ""gospel"" equals jubilant spiritualism). Attention Jason: you've hit a wall. Or saturation level. Your influences used to be in your music; now they're on the surface with nothing much to speak of beneath."
2,This Much Polish doesnt improve the sound,"Unfortunately my hopes for this album have not risen. DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN and DON'T JUST DO SOMETHING send chills down my spine but everything else sounds too smooth and shiny. I expected something more to happen during WON'T GET TO HEAVEN but it just drags on like many of the other songs.I like the original sparser sounding Spacemen 3 version of LORD CAN YOU HEAR ME too, it captures the sense of alienation better.Plus where is Ray Dickaty's...tenor sax?! You can barely hear it in the mix with the overblown orchestra.The arangements are nowhere near COOL WAVES or SPREAD YOUR WINGS 2 of my favorite songs.To be fair the new B-sides ROCK AND ROLL, GOING DOWN SLOW, and AMAZING GRACE make up for the actual bland album.I definately hope Jason reinvents the sound of the next album when it comes out in 3 years.Oh yeah the live show makes the album unneccessary anyway!!"
3,Not Dissapointed,I bought this for two reasons. 1) the chick on the cover is _hot_! and 2) cause it's got that track from the movie SWINGERS... Being that there aren't a lot of new lounge records these days I thought I'd take a chance. The record is perfect for... well... it's good background music.
2,Shaft broke,"This was a Christmas gift for my adult brother who just got a new dartboard. One of the shafts on a dart broke after 10 minutes of play and not particularly hard play, either. Disappointing as he loved the shamrock motif. Will be going back."
5,the greatest,"the presentation is by one of the ""completed Jew"" pioneers; Zola was a wonderful man with a powerful message; this DVD is quite old - I would guess it was made 10 -15 years ago, well before he became ill. A great message of the importance of Passover to Christian believers"
3,Passover,I thought I was ordering Zola's teaching about the Passover. Although this was not the DVD I thought I was ordering it was o.k.
4,OK but not great,"the 4th edition of Singers Musical Theatre Anthology for soprano is a handy little book....but I found many of the songs to be slightly low or even in the previous mezzo/belter books. With that said, it's still a decent book and a good one to add to the collection, I just wish it contained more real soprano pieces that were a bit more unknown"
2,Non-Teilhardian and pantheistic,"This is a very informative book, since the author spreads his net far and wide as is obvious from the biliography. His views are novel and interesting, but definitely part company with Teilhard de Chardin and traditional theism. Pere Teilhard's vision is convergent; O'Murchu's is divergent. He presents us with a universe having no beginning and no end. Also, God exists within this universe, but not outside it. These two concepts are consistent with pantheism. A more traditional and more awe-inspiring view is that the universe exists within God.Pere Teilhard's system focuses on the Omega point as the point of convergence for all evolution and all space-time. This is really missing from O'Murchu, since his universe never really gets to Omega."
2,Non-Teilhardian and pantheistic (from Maltese Falcon),"This is just a note to acknowledge that the review entitled ""Non-Teilhardian and pantheistic"" was submitted by me before I became Amazon's Maltese Falcon."
2,Too much!,"""Faith Healer"" isn't the strongest song from the album ""Bloodline"" so I have no idea why it was released as a single with 6 different mixes. The very last mix is a pretty good dance track especially since there are no vocals but other than that unless you love the song or are a diehard Recoil fan you can probably do without this release. Alan still kicks though!"
4,Not a perfect match,Purchased this and the Delta 7210-SS drain as a match set. They are not a matched set. The metal colors are slightly different - not enough to worry about just a slight difference.But the finish is very different. On this one the grain (not sure if that is the correct term) runs in concentric rings. The grain looks like the piece was turned on a lathe (though I'm sure it was not). The other drain the grain runs across it in straight lines like it was sanded with a belt sander. It is a small thing but if they advertize it as a matched set it should be matched.No gaskets are included you just get the metal drain and the stopper; nothing else is included.
3,It matches our Stainless Steel Delta Faucet,"We ordered this to match our Stainless Steel Delta Faucet.We like its look very much. Just be sure that the Flange matches your disposal hook-up. This did not match the disposal system hookup we bought. This model is for a 3bolt mount system. Our disposal is a wasteking EZ mount. Sooooooo therefore we had to order an adapter kit. This put back our kitchen redo process back about a week. We do however like this look much more than the chrome flange that came with our disposal. Ourwise it gets a better rating than I actually gave it,so more like a 4* because it seems a bit pricy, but it does look good!"
1,Disappointing,"I have owned several Rowenta irons in the past. I have loved them all except this one. It started leaking within five weeks after we received it. It irons OK but it leaks now and this is just not acceptable for an iron that cost this much. If you want a good iron, go to Target and if it doesn't function properly you can alway return it for full refund. According to Amazon, I can not get a refund."
4,Almost perfect,"I love absolutely everything about this iron except that the handle is a little big for someone with small hands. After ironing for a while, my hand begins to ache. I have to point out that I do LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the hundreds of steam holes and that this iron comes with it's own water container to fill it. I always bothered me that I had to use my own measuring cups and forgot where I put them."
5,Can ironing really be fun?,"Well, maybe not, but this is a close as I have come to enjoying the task. This iron glides over fabrics, and leaves a lovely smooth path. It heats quickly, and makes fast work of a stack of shirts. The pointed tip fits nicely into cuffs and along buttons.Plus the pink appeals to my inner girl."
4,A quilter's thoughts on Rowenta irons,I received this iron last week and loved it from the moment I took it out of the box. I really like the pointy tip for pressing seams. It heats up quickly and has plenty of steam. I wish that it had a larger water reserve. I totally love the pink color. In fact I orderd two more irons for backups. I approve of this iron for the Breast Cancer Research.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is the worst iron I have ever owned. I am a quilter and I have to use spray starch in order to get this thing to even press a seam properly on cotton and the temperature is set on high! If you have a cotton article of clothing that is just ever so slightly wrinkled..forget about it. Don't waste your money. I happened to mention to 2 other quilters about my Rowenta and they said they had them in the past and they were not happy with them at all and would never own one again. I just bought a Panasonic cordless and I love it!! Good bye Rowenta forever!! If I could, I would give this no stars!"
1,UPS failed to deliver,UPS also muffed delivery of this item so I'll never know whether it was nice or not.
1,This iron was a lemon!,"I had heard that Rowenta was a great brand of iron to buy so I splurged and spent more than I have ever spent on an iron, thinking that I was getting a really good product. WRONG! The heating element burned out one year to the date of purchase. Luckily, it was still covered under the warranty so they repaired it. But one year from the time of the repair (only 2 years from purchase), the iron suddenly went hot, burned through a new shirt and started on fire. I only used this iron once or twice a week, so it's not like it was used excessively. I will never buy a Rowenta again. They are over priced and my experience is that they are no better than lower priced brands."
2,What a bummer!,"I have had this iron for a year or two, and it is very irritating that it turns itself off while I am ironing!! And it leaks! I loved it when it was new, but it has not lasted nearly long enough for what I paid (a lot more than $50). It also seems to take forever to heat up. One thing about the Rowenta irons--you must use tap water, but if your water has too much of this or that, it will cause problems. But if you use distilled water, it WILL leak for sure, within about 6 usings."
4,Wow,It's a graet book its was exhilariting book. I have read it 5 times. It has helped me with my school work very much. Iam doing better its my classes. This is great for all children. When you see this book in a store never pass it by. It couldn't get ant better.
5,Good for adults as well as kids,This version of the research summed up here is written to be accessible for children. But each of the tips applies as well to adults.Great way to get good habits started to improve and preserve our brains!
4,MacGregor Wooden Softball Bat,The bats are a good deal for the price. It worked out well and will use it again next year.
2,good kids bat,"this item shows up in an adult softball bat search. this is only a kids bat. not at all suited for adult use. having said that, it's a good kids bat. light weight, nice looking, and inexpensive. just don't hit a real baseball or softball with it, or it is going to be fire wood."
3,Decent bat for cheap,"This bat was OK ... handles broke pretty easily. We started with six and had to replace three of them before the end of our slow-pitch softball season. Part of the reason likely was due to less-experienced hitters were generally the ones using this bat, resulting in more hits down on the handle instead of on the sweet spot. All in all, no complaints about this bat for the price!"
1,Do Not Purchase,I purchased (2) of the MacGregor Wooden Softball bats. one in a 32 inch and the other in a 34 inch. The 34 inch broke on the first swing and the 32 inch made it through 3 swings.I would not recommend this product for purchase. There is also no warranty on a wooden softball bat. This is my first time in 40 years playing with a wooden bat for softball.The bat I ordered from a different company is still going strong.Dawn M.
1,MacGregor wooden softball bat,Bat broke the first time at the cages - right out of the wrapping. Have an older model and never had any difficulties. The bat is marketed as a softball bat but with the breakage unsure if it is.
3,Erudite book for the serious UU,"This little book is reasonably interesting, though it tends towards the dry - probably more suitable for someone already on the UU path more than the idly curious. I found it helpful, and it answered a lot of questions I had about Unitarianism."
2,Great Brush. Goody makes the same for less.,I liked the brush but the shipping costs outweighed the brush price. You can get the same effect with a goody brand type.
4,Heavy Duty,"This brush is heavy duty, and does a great job in detangling my natural kinky curly hair. First time I have ever paid this amount for a brush but I will say its worth the price. No complaints."
5,Good for natural hair,Sturdy handle and the bristle are firm yet do not feel rough when brushing through my hair. The brush does not break my hair much with proper care.
4,Great Brush for detangling,I am an african american woman with natural hair and I purchased this brush with hopes of making the detangling process a little easier. The product has lived up to it's expectations. The only small complaint I have is that it doesn't work well unless the hair is saturated with conditioner. Otherwise you risk pulling out a significant amount of strands. Once the hair has conditioner and has a good slip the brush glides through the hair easily. You may have to remove a few rows of bristles to help so it doesn't tangle your hair but in my process I enjoy the product. The shipping was SUPER fast.
5,Denman Hair Brushes - Quality,Outstanding product in a professional grade. They last years and are well worth their price.
2,Pulls out my hair!,"I was looking for something that would give a salon-straight blow out when I wash my hair at home. Round brushes are really difficult for me to maneuver in my hands, so the Denman brush seemed a lot easier.Its easy to use and certainly does get my hair straighter than other methods I've used, but its scary how much of my hair gets pulled out. After a few uses, a friend of mine told me to remove a few rows of bristles in the brush to minimize the shedding. Still, it pulls out more hair than i'm comfortable with. I've stopped using it entirely."
5,Where have you been all my life?,"Perfect brush for those of us with thick curly hair. It eliminates the need for different sized combs to truly tackle the tangles. It also separates the curls really nicely by itself. They always look so happy! Paired with a great conditioner, I think this guy is unstoppable."
3,Nice Brush I guess?,Guess my hair really isnt long enough just yet to reall appreciate this brush Ive used it once or twice works like any other brush i dont see the big deal! *shrugs*
2,Brissles are stiff and sharp,"I bought this brush because of all the good reviews, but I completely disagree. The bristles on the brush are very stiff, pointy and SHARP. You do NOT want them to rub against your scalp. Most my other brushes have little round bulbs on the tips to avoid this. Maybe I will use it for a cat brush instead."
4,I like it..,"Thus far, I can honestly say this brush works pretty well with my natural hair. :) I'm so glad I seen others talking about this on youtube. :) It's a bit pricey but I really like it thus far. :) Thank you."
4,Great Product,"It took awhile to ship, but it came finally. I use this brush for my kinky natural hair. The only thing negative is that I wish the bristle tip had a round tip on it. Other than that if your a ""natural"" this would be a great brush for you."
5,Great!,"I was skeptical at first, but this brush really does something for your curl pattern. If you're natural you should definitely get this product."
4,A quality brush,"I've heard a lot of hype about this brush and decided to get one. I mean, detangling used to be a long process that I had no patience for, but this really made it easier. It's easy to clean, gentle when used properly.It really helps with the detangling but you still have to be careful and take your time instead of trying to rip through the hair."
1,Factory Reject???,"The brush looks like a factory reject, a 2nd in production. On one end the red rubber that holds the bristles looks torn. I am a amazon weekly customer and Prime member. All items i purchase are the right-competitive price. Sorry to say not this one. Looks like something from the ""99cent"" store. Unfortunately the packaging was thrown out, I would have returned it. I threw the brush out too. I purchased on the reputation of Amazon (always 5 star) bad decision this time."
2,Didn't Work for Me,It was like digging a rake through my natural hair. It pulled out huge tufts of hair but I so wanted this to work because of the positive reviews so I took out 3 of the bristles and tried it again. It still pulled out a lot of hair so I took out 2 more bristles and I was now left with 4 and it STILL pulled out a lot of hair!!!! I was stunned and sooooo disappointed because I'd read so many wonderful perfect things about this brush. It's now lying useless in my bathroom. Total waste of money. Maybe it will work for someone else but it didn't work for me :(
3,An ergonomic challenge . . . sort of . . .,"The bristle portion is fine . . . works fine. I have the 7-row model.The problem for me is that the handle is not only thin, but disproportionate in length to the bristle portion. I have large stocky hands and the end of the handle lies just past the center of my palm. The thinness and proportion of the handle leaves me feeling that I don't have the comfortable grip that I should with any good tool.The bristles get a 4-star rating . . . the handle, 1-star."
1,Thief,"This brush rips through my natural corkscrew curls and doesn't stop until it has stolen at least a handful of hair. I'm so glad I discovered the tangle teezer. My oldest daughter hated it after the first use it made our curls frizzy and less defined. I just use a leave-in and Jason curl defining gel, and this brush made me look like a French Poodle. Thank the universe for the TT!!!!"
2,"Not your 70's brush, really hard bristles, funky smell","I bought this because it looked exactly like a classic brush I had as a kid which I loved. It was made to look that way, no doubt. However, it is nothing like those old brushes so if that is what you are looking for, don't bother. The bristles are hard as a rock, it rips your hair and hurts your scalp. Ir also has a funky smell - agaain not the smell the old ones had, which is a truly particular smell of that orange rubber base-not that I liked it before but I was expecting the old smell, if any smell at all. Instead I got a funky strong chemical smell. YUK.2 stars is solely because it is a solidly made brush, and most of the problem is my subjective dislike of a brush so hard is is bad for my hair and hurts my scalp, and because I was expecting a specific brush that looks just like this one. Other people might like it, if they need rock hard bristles to gdt through super thick pr sup curly hair."
2,"Handle too short, brush hurts","Im sure this is a great brush for some people, but the handle is too short to provide sufficient leverage for Me, and the bristles are so hard it sort of hurts the scalp. A little disappointed."
1,Bait and switch,"I ordered a Denman brush as pictured on the web site I bought it from. Black handle, orange cushion, white teeth.I received one with a white cushion and black teeth. I didn't feel right in my hand but It's been a while since my last one. Also the white cushion slips easily out of the handle when used. It feels like a knock off.Soon afterward I was at my hairdresser's and for just a few dollars more bought what I wanted. I see the difference now as described on the web page. I'm just annoyed that a picture of what I was actually buying was not presented to alert me to the different brushes available. It's not worth the trouble to send it back since postage to return it will just end up costing me the price of the brush anyway.No hard feelings. I know I should have read it more carefully. I just think it should have been more clear.Love my Denman brush.Margaret Cranor"
1,Did not like it at all :(,"Was so disappointed in this brush. It felt like it was pulling my hair out and not getting the tangles out of my hair correctly. I even modified the brush like so many blogs I saw about the denman brush. But still did not like it. So I really give the brush no stars, horrible brush, but i had to give it a rating so 1 star for me. If you want to try a good detangler brush tray TANGLE TEEZER works SO MUCH BETTER than denaman brush."
4,More Than Adequate,"This is a very nice brush, but a little large for my purposes. I purchased the Denman D3 (blue with crystals) and it was perfect; however, this brush (the D4) was cheaper. So I guess it's a personal preference, but this is still an excellent brush nonetheless."
5,Best hair brushing brush I've found,"This brush is great for hair brushing. I have thick, fine straight hair, and the bristles on this brush leave my hair smooth, soft and shiny. This is the only brush I've owned where I wanted to brush my hair. It doesn't look like much, but this is a quality product."
4,Pretty Good,"Overall it is a nice brush. I like that there's not little ball ends on the bristles that will fall off over time... that was my problem in the past... It seems that i will hold up pretty well too, which I'm really happy about. I have pretty thick, long hair to mid back and it goes through just fine with it's dry, but a little harder when it's wet. Maybe I don't have enough conditioner in my hair for it to go through smoothly idk! I would recommend this brush if you want a quality brush."
5,Wonderful Product,I love this brush. It is so sturdy which makes it easy to detangle my thick curly hair. I highly recommend this brush.
5,Works great!,"I had one like this when I was a kid, I'm sure it was my step-sister's who was quite spoiled.I'm a 28 yearold man and I have long straight hair that goes halfway down my back (I look a bit like jesus sometimes lol), and this brush works perfect for me and my girlfriend likes to steal it as well.Very efficient and gets the job done nicely. One thing to keep in mind though is that if you have a sensitive scalp the bristles on this brush are sharper then those round tipped ones found on many generic brushes, this works better, but could be painful if you are to heavy handed."
3,The bristle pad keeps coming off,"I bought this brush because I was impressed with the high rating and bec I had a similar (knock-off) brush when I was in high school. But after my daughter pulled off the pad to wash it the first time, the pad kept sliding off whenever she brushed her hair. She has medium thick hair past her shoulder blades. She doesn't mind pushing the pad back into the handle, but it would drive me crazy. Whenever I see that the pad is not pushed in all the way, I can't help but do it for her and it is not easy. It is a tight fit to push it in but not to come off. Go figure."
5,Truth in advertising.,Works perfectly.Just received mine in the mail today.I probably went over my head three or four times with the brush and it knocked 95% of the tangles out.My hair was softer and easier to comb after using this brush.As long as they keep selling it I will be a lifetime customer of Denman brushes.
2,My old goodie was better,"Purchased this to replace an old goodie brush from the '90s and this wasn't as good.The plastic teeth aren't smooth so they snag my hair.Actually hurts to brush this through my hair, my hair is thick and long (middle of my back).The brush creates static, unfortunate since I purchased this brush to combat static in the winter months?Expensive for what it is, not worthy of the extra cost.Frustrating that simple items cost more, yet you get less quality.My old goodie was purchased for cheap when I was in high school and it had quality and lasted.What happened?"
2,Not Great,"I had a cheep goody version of this brush that lasted for years. It finaly broke and I searched for a replacement. I purchased this brush thinking it would be even better than my goody, but after only a few months the handel broke off. I am so disapointed, but I still love the design of the head. I dont know what I am going to do. In the end the brush is a good one if the handels wouldnt break off. I am not sure if I will buy another one. FYI My hair is fine, mid back to waist long and would not be considered thick at all."
1,boring stupid toy,"i got this a couple of years ago and i get cheap presents because my grandparents need to buy cheap but do they have to be this cheap?! this game sucks. it is hard to follow and the mat is slippery and the music is boring. when you wear socks on the mat you slide. when you wear no socks you get stuck to it. i hate this so much!!!!!! i really hope that this christmas, i might be getting something that's actually good quality and i like!!!!!!!"
1,look for a better product,I purchased this for my three daughters hoping that one of them would be able to handle it. It never worked from the start. We set it up and turned it on. It made a lot of noise and the pads didn't pick up there steps. The quality is just not there.
3,The box is Deceptive.,"There are no lights on the floor and it doesn't seem like there are any sensors either. It can't respond to your actions.The toy does what it says on the box. Keep kids who like to dance entertained but if you were looking for something that has lights, this is not the best choice.I bought it for 13 dollars when there was a sale on Amazon. It is not worth much more than that."
2,Bored to DEATH!,"I got this as a Christmas present. I've always had a love for dancing, so of course I wanted to try it out right away. After playing for a bit I realized that it repeated the same pattern over and over and over! I wan't happy. The music that came with it isn't even considered music. The pads on the bottom to help it stick feel of within a bit. At the end it doesn't tell you your score, or if you missed any. The lights don't change after you hit, they changed like every 5 seconds or something. I'm twele years old and I was dissapointed in this. This might be ok if you buy it for like a little kid."
1,What a waste of money,"What a let down. This was the one toy my child was truly looking forward to at Christmas and this was the worst toy ever. I can't believe the box says it will ""teach you to dance"". It barely works half the time and I was thinking of returning it for another thinking that the one I have is broken, but after reading the other reviews, I realize its just a piece of junk. It never rates your dance moves and the songs are just terrible. Please don't waste your time or money buying this toy!"
1,Another Burned Customer,I guess Moose Mountain's quality control is pretty lousy too since ours never worked at all right out of the box. Totally dead. Stay away from this one.
1,Boring....,"Completely boring, poor design. You might as well flash a flashlight at your little girl and tell her to dance on some saran wrap. It is about the same, might even be more entertaining."
1,Wave bye-bye to the Dance Maker,"If you are looking for an ""easy to do"" toy for your kids...this isn't the one. It came with no instructions! Movements don't register correctly! Not sure what it is for, expect taking up space. I've actually gotten some laughs out of it though. My kids keep asking me why the song won't change. It is supposed to have 3 different songs you can change. (NOT MUCH VARIETY!) Don't waste your dollar!"
1,Contains lead,"The packaging for this product states: ""NOTE: The brass [adjusting nut] in this product contains lead. ... Do not place your hands in your mouth after handling this product. Do not place the product in your mouth. WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER HANDLING THIS PRODUCT."""
5,City Slickers 2,"An excellent sequal to the first movie and just as enjoyable. Great entertainment, even for our children."
4,Another great Jack Palance Performance!!,"Many would say that City Slickers 2 - The Legend of Curly's Gold is not as good as the first City Slickers, and I'd have to agree with that, but it is still an entertaining movie nonetheless. As always Jack Palance and Billy Crystal deliver, but Daniel Stern and Jon Lovitz are also entertaining as well. Although the movie is good we don't get any Extras on the DVD which is reasonable for this movie since it didn't live up to the first, but not to have any Extras on the first film seems unwise to me. Hopefully they'll give us a better release, but I doubt it unless there is financial gain as a result of doing so."
2,Deja vu!,"Why do they have to do it? OK, I admit, ""City Slickers"" was great, but why do they have to try to capitalize on the success of a fist novie and make these sequels. And why do you, yes YOU the people who go and see them and rate them so highly, give them the encouragement. Witht he exception of the ""Star wars"" trilogy and ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy sequels never fail to disappoint! This is the same old garbage withthe same old gags. ""He's behind me isn't he?"" Phil nods ""Yes!"" with a vacant and stupid grin on his ugly mug. Oh please. We haven't heard THAT one before have we? That was incedibly annoying! Even moreso when we are expected to laugh at it! ""City Slickers"" was a self-contained movie. It didn't need a sequel. So why do it?"
5,City Slickers 2-The Legend of Curly's Gold,"City Slickers 2 - The Legend of Curly's GoldI had been looking for this for a while and was glad to find this copy.Thanks,Dana"
4,Movie review,"The movie as a whole, is a very good film.. The only problem I have, is there was not a lot of action or suspense like the first.."
1,"Boy, did that suck!",A strained sequel. Too much unnecessary build up to nothing. The only thing I came close to appreciating about this saunter-through-boredom was Jack Palance.
5,City Slickers II,"was an enjoyable sequel to the first movie. Like most sequels, they do not usually stand a chance to the first. But, was still an enjoyable movie."
4,good movie,I enjoyed City Slickers 1 and enjoyed this one also. Shipment was quick and the DVD was in great shape.
3,Good value for some people,"Generally a good-quality product but the material is too thin for my taste. Can't compare the overall quality to The North Face Big Shot, for example (it costs three times more, too, I know)Otherwise, for $25 a great value for someone who is not going to carry heavy stuff."
4,charming screwball comedy,"the imposters sneaks up on the heels of the BIG NIGHT, WITH TUCCI AND CO. PROVIDING 1998 AUDIENCES WITH A CHARMING SCREWBALL COMEDY. THE SUPPORTING CAST AND THE OCEANLINER SETTING IS A MARX BROTHERS INSPIRE TOUCH. ISABELLA AS USUAL PLAYS A GREAT SUPPORTTING PART. THIS MOVIE SHOULD NOT BE MISSED."
2,The Imposters DVD,"When viewing this product on line, it was stated that this DVD was ""like new condition."" I'm not sure that I agree after recieving this DVD that had quite a few scratches on it, two of them pretty bad. It does play well, and that is the main thing I wanted. Listing it as ""slightly scratched"" would not have changed my mind about buying it, but I feel I was misled on the condition."
2,"Good Look, Bad Script","Stanley Tucci's follow-up as director of Big Night is something of a disappointment. The Impostors lacks the sensitive development of character that turned the original into such an unexpected pleasure. That may not be surprising since the first film was a comedy-drama and the second a screwball comedy, but it's still badly missed since Tucci's screenplay affords lots of movement, but little in the way of comic timing (or lines). What the film does boast, however, is fun art direction and costumes, an energetic score, and an amusing cast--albeit the latter is mostly wasted."
3,"Slow start, side-splitting finish!","The first hour or so was hard to sit through. It was slow, disjointed, and cheesy - but just wait! The entire first half of the movie was just setting up for the outrageous onslaught of laughs when punchline after punchline finally came together! Definately worth seeing, just for the experience."
3,"i get it, but should have been better","with the great cast i expected more. i get how this was a tribute to the comedy-duo teams of laurel and hardy and the like but it didn't all work for this viewer.there are alot of giggles throughout but they are not all out laughs.i love the cast and they all do their best with what they are given.i really wanted to like this movie,but at best it was only ok.i'd love to see more movies like this done better and hopefully there will be.we need comedy teams like laurel and hardy today.if stiller and wilson is the best that hollywood has to offer than i'm afraid that comedy-duos are a thing of the past."
1,the impostors,It was terrible! Lili played a good part of course. But the rest was just plain stupid!
1,nothing,"That basically is what describes this movie, it's just nothing, its a dull stupid, a mediocre plot, overacted characters, well, i might have laughed once or twice but that is all, and not a cuckle or a big laugh, just a small one, anyhow, there is no reason why anyone should pay to endure this movie"
5,Amazing Movie,Modern day Marks Brothers. Great cast and hilarious scrip. Many mete film jokes. !Spoiler Alert! Our favorite part by far (In a movie that was very enjoyable) was the dance during the credits. How fun!
5,This movie is perfect,"Must see. Features all sorts of comedy, even slapstick. Has not been topped. As for cream puffs, I hate them."
5,Lots of classic fun,"It takes a while to get this movie; in the beginning, for perhaps the first 20 mins, you'll probably be wondering what gives. The fact is, it's made more in the style of a comedic Indie than a Big Spender Hollywood production. But it's alot of fun; plus, Tucci and Platt make a great odd couple. It's hard to choose a favorite performace out of the talented ensamble, (ranging from Campbell Scott, to Lili Taylor, to Steve Buscemi, to Alison Janney of the West Wing,) but you get this happy feeling watching them have fun in this completely odd but warm movie. It will depend on the person, but I believe this is definatley worth the buy. :-)"
2,"Odd start, Funny Finish","I really need to view this one a few more times to do the beginning justice. The opening was compelling, but I kept wondering where Platt and Tucci were going with it. Things kick into gear once the action moves to the ship. I'd see it again for the performances of Lili Taylor and...of course!...Steve Buscemi. I appreciate the dark humor of Buscemi's character Happy Franks trying to off himself and failing at every turn (one of the attempts was with a magician's prop). Oliver Platt is sublime in the ballroom scene, as he tries frantically to warn would-be victims of the various plots and they just don't get it."
4,Book was missing Pages & Maps,"I only paid a few dollars for this book but was led to believe it was in ""gently used"" condition, instead it had many pages ripped out as well as all the Maps. I suppose it was a fan price but sure would have been nice to have been told so much was missing out of the book, the maps I now will have to buy again."
2,This book had few redeeming qualities.,"My husband and I purchased this book to go on our honeymoon and were sorely disappointed. The descriptions were vague and often downright incorrect. Luquillo beach, which the authors described as one of the best beaches in the Carribean, had dingy grey water and was filled with garbage. This is only one example of many many misrepresentations. The guide leaned almost exclusively to very expensive restaurants, and even these were nothing to write home about. We had more luck after we ditched the guide and started exploring on our own. Its one good point was some interesting background on the history of Puerto Rico. However, this was not enough to make me buy another Frommer's guide."
2,Puerto Rico,"I keep forgetting how much I don't care for Frommer's guides and wind up buying another one.1. Frommer's has next to no pictures.2. I think somebody went to a couple of random restaurants and beaches and decided to call them the ""Best of"".For example, Frommer's says there is snorkeling at Luqillo beach, but there is none (unless all you want to see is sand). Luquillo is a great beach for swimming, but the snorkeling sucks.Another example is the restaurant in the southeast part of the island called Tulio's. While it is a nice restaurant and our food was good, it is not cheap. At least I don't consider $20 a plate cheap."
2,Map Problems,"Some maps in the guide don't reflect current reality eg the pull out map shows a major highway on the SE coast. However construction projects for many sections of that highway (Rt 53) have not yet commenced.In general we had problems navigating because every map we picked up from guidebooks and tourist brochures was wrong, each in its own special way! If driving, do yourself a favor and buy a very detailed and up-to-date map before you head out."
4,"Flavorful and good ... but not actually ""hot & sour"".","This was my first experience with a Bear Creek soup product. Their hot & sour soup mix couldn't be easier to use (boil water, open package) or faster (ready in 10 minutes) but it doesn't actually taste like real hot & sour soup, and I've enjoyed Chinese cuisine all over the United States. But that's not to say I don't like Bear Creek's effort! It still tastes distinctly Asian, has a nice kick to it, and if you reduce the water from 8 cups to 7 it's a little more robust. I also add cubed tofu, a package ofMiracle Noodle Shirataki Rice, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)and a couple of beaten eggs, all of which turn this soup into a very flavorful complete meal."
5,Hot and sour soup mix,The seller was prompt in sending my soup mix and there was no problem whatsoever.
1,This stuff is pretty nasty,"It's pretty gross. Too bad you have to buy such a large quantity to try it. First of all, ""Hearty"" no way. it's plain and gross. Nothing hot and nothing sour about it. I added lots of chili oil and vinegar to make it more like what you get in the restaurant, but it's no good. I was looking for an alternative to what you can get at the supermarket, but this is not it. Also... it has NOODLES. I've NEVER had hot and sour soup with noodles EVER. Weird. Noodles must be cheap."
2,Not quite as I expected,"The hot and sour soup was good. I'm not sure what it needed, but I couldn't make it taste as good as some of the restaurant hot and sour soup I have eaten. It was tasty, but not like I wanted the Hot n Sour soup to be."
2,Bear Creek makes wonderful products...,Just not this one. For some reason it's just not right. The flavor isn't like any I've had a restaurants.
1,NOT hot and sour soup at all!,I love hot and sour soup and will order it every time i'm at a chinese restaurant. i've been to many chinese restaurants from the cheap hole in the wall to the really upscale. Rarely have I had a hot and sour soup that I didn't like. This soup was NOT at all like any hot and sour soup you will have ever had at a chinese restaurant. So I was pretty disappointed.
5,Fantastic soup!,"I absolutely love this soup. I add tofu, mushrooms and sometimes bamboo shoots. It makes a huge amount so I actually split the mix in half and make half at a time. It satisfies my craving for hot and sour while being low-calorie."
2,not helpfull,"This video was not helpfull at all to me. I just started playing hold em a couple of months ago, and have bought other books on it. This video doesn't touch any of the criteria it should. It teaches you how to play, but that's about it. There is no section on hand reading, or any other good things you NEED to know."
3,Very Very Good,"This is a good review for beginners and for intermediate, Pay close attention to the pot odds section, it is very helpful.For the intermediate players, you will definitley have to fast forward the first 1/3 of the tape because it talks about how the game is played as far as posting and position. I found it very helpful. But it is definitley not for the adavanced player.Good luck"
3,Rounders 101,"One of the good things about this video is the selection of characters sitting around the poker table - the huge bearded guy with the sleeveless red t-shirt is particularly priceless. I cannot imagine picking up the game just from watching this tape (even though it promises to show you the basics) - it is just too quick. There's a lot of useful information on which hands to hold and fold, but it goes by so quickly that you couldn't possibly absorb it. Could be a helpful refresher for someone who already knows the game but needs coaching. In the end, this is probably a helpful tape to watch once, but it you won't want to watch it over and over again. It's just too boring."
1,for hypothyroidism only!,"I was very disappointed because Gaia Herbs claims that the product is designed to support healthy thyroid functioning. But they fail to mention that it's only for those who have hypothyroidism. Since I have hyperthyroidism I experienced a very bad case of diarrhea, heart palpitations and anxiety attacks. It took me over a week to realize that all these symptoms were related to the supplement."
2,Not much to tell,I've been taking this product for about 3 weeks and can honestly say that I don't feel any difference. I've been borderline hypothyroid for several years and my doctor told me to try one of the supplements on the market to see if they would help. I guess I'll move on to the next one.
5,Love the Style!,Had these a month now and they work just like a coaster should except have a lovely design to go with it. They match my decor perfectly. Very lovely.
4,Helping Guinea Pig Owners Since 1972,"A true sign of a classic is the test of time. Classics are VERY hard to find in the world of pet care books, because usually the information is out of date by the time the book is published, or it's just written very dryly. However, this book--originally published in 1972 and reprinted in 1980--still stands up over the course of the years. Housing, Feeding, Habits are especially well done. What is really impressive is a small course on genetics that made more sense than any biology class I've ever taken! One of the few books on guinea pigs written by an American--which means more space devoted to cavy care than cavy shows, since shows are far more poular in Engalnd than in the US. No, it's not a comphrehensive book by any means and the photographs are of average quality for the most part, but still a good book to add to your library if you keep guinea pigs, even after all these years."
4,Enjoyable,"A fine life of a fascinating and, it seems, often infuriating man. It has fitted in with many of the good American history books I have been enjoying of late.It is well worth any reader's attention- though I find the author at times at little too determined to drive his points home- one gets them the first time!"
3,Average book,"This book seems to be a patched together by the author. Many sentences and ideas are repeated. Overall, I was not impressed. The author often tells things in a bizarre order. Introducing someone and in the same sentence telling you how and when they die. Reading this you appreciate the abilities of authors like Goodwin and McCullough etc. Greeley's life comes across as boring for much of the book. I wish there was a better book on him"
3,A bit noisy,"I bought one of these to try them out. It work fine and the Z-Wave range seem good. The only problem is that when the relay switches on or off there is a very loud THUNK. Must be some really industrial relay in there!Note that this is not a dimmer so you can only turn the outlet on or off so if you want a dimmer get a different unit.The best feature of this device is that you can still operate a lamp manually even if it's also controlled via Z-Wave. By turning the switch on the lamp 4 times, the relay turns on. Note that if you turn the lamp off by hand, you cannot turn it back on via Z-wave. I have it setup to automatically turn off the light after a while so no one ever manually turns off the light.I use HomeSeer (www.homeseer.com) software to control many of the lights on my home via Z-Wave."
3,Great Problem Set Text,"Reed is a great book for problem applications and ""working"" your way through Quantum Mechanics. This is a great introductory text for undergraduates to help explain basic potential systems. Later chapters though are very vague so there isn't much beyond it."
4,Penn Plax Cascade Biological Ceramic Rings,Have not used them yet but arrived as expected. Have read about ceramic rings and their usefulness for maintaining helpful bacteria in aquarium filtration. Will update after having used them.
1,Propaganda,"A very well researched but poorly reasoned ""argument"". I use the term argument loosely because it reads more like one big infomercial trying to sell you on the idea that Liberalism = Fascism. In reality it's just propaganda disguised as an argument. It looks like a book, it reads like a book, but it not a book. The logic was so tortured and the reasoning so infantile, that I had to put it down after the first few chapters."
1,"""If you want a vision of the future, imagine a daycare worker giving a toddler a sugarfree bran muffin -- forever.""","Goldberg's weird definition of fascism was customized to make it possible to say things like this:""The quintessential Liberal Fascist isn't an SS storm trooper; it is a female grade school teacher with an education degree from Brown or Swarthmore.""But that's just loony. If Goldberg had written ""1984"", at the end he'd have O'Brien saying:""If you want a vision of the future, imagine a daycare worker giving a toddler a sugarfree bran muffin -- forever.""Or how about this:""A hug is liberal fascism's equivalent of a pistol shot to the back of the head.""You can have infinite fun with Goldberg. Who was the first liberal fascist, for example? Wasn't it Cardinal Biggles with his terrifying Comfy Chair?"
5,Great book of history,"this book is extremely well written and eye opening, it is very well researched and supports its claim with facts. I understand liberals don't like to face the reality that their progressive ideology has its roots in fascist ideas but Goldberg makes a compelling case in this book."
2,Unreadable...same old Chicken-Little hysteria.,"This book is unreadable....to be fair, I only got 50 pages into it at the library AND I am a moderate. However, having read Goldberg's columns on-line, he is really sort of a joke: recycling the same old imperialist arguments, supporting the Iraq war...then reversing opinion and again blaming liberals.He tries to dress up his follow-the-pack conservatism with historical references, but I found the attempt half-hearted and really by shifting a few words around you could make the opposite case.So, Jonah....sorry dude, your reinforce the fact that your mother got you where you are...you add nothing new to an already tiresome debate leaving moderates like myself to scratch my head and wonder what all your Chicken-Little ranting is about....you're as bad as Dinesh and Ann."
1,Stylistically agonizing,"I was very excited to read this book. Here are the positives: Goldberg is obviously intelligent, the material is well-researched, and the topic is relevant.Negatives: I have read piles of political\historical non-fiction books. If they compare to jogging barefoot on a beach, this book is a slog through a chest-high tar pit in a suit of armor. He is presenting an insane amount of information here. Long-winded, overwritten, excruciating sentences in a stream-of-consciousness organization make for a maddening and frustrating experience. There is no relief from it. I can't believe the publisher intended this book for mass consumption. I had college textbooks that were easier to take than this book. Your ""A"" game may not be good enough to handle this; too bad it is needed at all."
2,"A work Jerry Falwell, James Kennedy and R.L. Hubbard would have given 5 stars","As a registered Republican and one who ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate, I will not bother with a lengthy review; I'll simply say this is the worse book on the subject I've ever read. Having said that, I'm certain it'll be a welcome addition to Sarah Palin's library, if indeed she has a library, and her disciples."
5,Excellent,"Jonah Goldberg's very well researched book ""Liberal Fascism"" will open your eyes to both the true ideologies and intentions of the Liberal Left. Just as importantly it will enlighten the reader as to the true history of the Leftists & ""Progressives"". Funny thing, once Americans actually understand what the Progressives see as ""progress"" Hillary Clinton's claim to be an ""early 20th Century Progressive"" really means, most see her and other Liberals & Progressives for the threat they really are. ""Liberal Fascism"" should be required reading by all freedom loving Americans."
5,Reality hurts,"Liberals will hate this book. That alone means it is grounded in the reality of history. It clearly delineates the origins of progressive/liberal thought and their need for control as long as they are the ones writing the rules. Liberal totalitarianism is good while conservative totalitarianism is bad. Liberal have the judgment to do the right thing while conservatives never would be trusted with such power. Only the liberal, enlightened mind can know what is best for humanity and we should be thankful they will share it with us. I am sure it is no accident that this book was published in an election year or that it targets Clinton specifically. However, it is clear that Obama is the Fascist through and through and only he can save us from destruction.Wake up America and kick this would be dictator to the curb where he belongs."
5,Political Reality Check,"First buy yourself a BIG dictionary if you want to experience the subtle nuances of this worth while book. The book is never the less very readable by the average person and I classify it as literature. You want to understand why you are baffled by current political ""achievements""? You will understand ""What is blowing in the wind"" after you get it laid out for you by this masterful Author."
5,"Libs hate it, it must be great","I've read about 70% of the book so far. Excellent. It really helps you see the political and social environment that Planned Parenthood could begin in. This book should be used as a textbook in schools.Oh, you'll notice that all the one star reviews focus on Hitler and fascism. That's because they haven't read the book. In fact they prove a point of Goldberg's when he says that today fascism is mainly identifed with Nazism. And so it proves true with these government educated libs. Doesn't matter that Nazism is only a very small part of this book. The lying reviewers aren't aware of this since they haven't read the book."
5,"Brilliant, come prepared to be educated.","This book is brilliant. If you read it with an open mind you will have your eyes opened and your textbook/media inspired notions of many aspects of U.S. history challenged. This is not a book you can casually read in the tub. This is a book that will have you highlighting, annotating, and cross referencing. I found myself continually referencing people and events via other sources yet totally engrossed throughout. You must read this book."
4,"Fascinating, but a bit disorganized","Jonah Goldberg has written an interesting and well-written book about the historical relationship between fascist political thought and what we now call ""liberalism"". The footnotes are useful for those interested in doing further investigation on their own.The one real flaw of the book, in my opinion, is that it could have benefited from better editing. It feels a bit disorganized and disjointed in places."
5,Liberal Fascism,This book explains a lot of things that our current administration does and what we could expect if reelected. I found it to be extremely well documented. It debunks the revisionist history we see in our schools today.
3,If you like reading stereo instructions.....,"I actually was very interested in this book and think that Jonah Goldberg is great but this book is like reading a stereo instructions.The information is great but his writing style was not good.I could not finish this book, as much as I wanted to it was just too difficult to read. Maybe I will check if there is an audio instead."
1,Sigh,"This book is full of unfounded claims that uses unrooted sources.This is Jonah Goldberg's contribution to the new wave of last-ditch efforts to redeem the republican party in Bush's failed presidency. Spoiler alert: This book says Liberal Fascism is a ""secret"" and then says it's a secret primarily because ""liberal"" and ""fascism"" don't ever exist together in history (book's claim).A helpful tag for this book would be ""propaganda"""
1,The opposite of the truth,"The fact is that Hitler and Mussolini were on the far right. Rather than try to distance their far right from today's far right, Goldberg tries to make them mainstream left. In other words, rather than merely downplaying the truth, he is telling us the opposite of the truth.I'm a liberal, but am not going to claim that Stalin and Mao were on the right."
2,"Please review the product, not give your own version of history.","Please review the listed book. As of the current date, 1/18/08, the highest rated critical review contains very little, if any, review of the book in question - it only contains the reviewer's opinions about the topic of the book."
1,Horrible Book,"This book tries to present biased political attacks as historic fact. His presentation fails to consider how fascist ideas have influenced the entire history of thought beyond the liberalist thread. Finally, his attack on Hillary Clinton betrays any feigned attempt at maintaining a position of academic neutrality."
1,file under satire,"What ""research""? This is just the cherry-picking of some vague historical similarities between the aspects of traditional liberalism and fascism. I suppose because Democratic presidents and totalitarian rulers both wore pants that's yet another likeness? I saw this guy on Glenn Beck last night, the host completely lapping up his totally asinine and laughable attempts to assassinate the concepts of liberalism and progressivism in an election year, while offering none of the overwhelming connections and similarities between fascism and neo-conservatism with its Constitution-shredding methods. Ridiculous."
1,Asinine,"I tried to give this book a chance, but it turned out to be the worst thing I've ever read aside from 'Battlefield Earth.'"
5,Just one thing to say and I didn't say it!!,"Norman Mattoon Thomas (November 20, 1884 - December 19, 1968) was a> leading> American socialist, pacifist, and six-time presidential candidate for the> Socialist Party of America.>> The Socialist Party candidate for President of the US ,> Norman Thomas, said this in a 1944 speech:>> ""The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But,> under the name of ""liberalism,"" they will adopt every fragment of the> socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation,> without knowing how it happened."" He went on to say: ""I no longer> need to run as a Presidential Candidate for the Socialist Party.>> The Democrat Party has adopted our platform."">"
4,Most Helpful,"I have really enjoyed this book. Goldberg has shined a light on what it truly means to be Liberal today. While I had heard some of this in college a lot of the information, especially about Wilson was all news to me. At times it does seem that Goldberg reaches a little to make his point, but he does make it. I would, and have, recommend this book to Liberals I know so that they can lean a little about their history and where their beliefs come from"
3,Not the Jonah I have grown to love,This is a very informative book. I am about half way thru w/ lots of passages highlighted for further research on some of the material. I didnt expect cosmo or the couch to make an appearance but I did expect a smattering of G-File type prose to find its way in the book. That cost it a star. When you write your next book I hope you pander to the crowd who enjoys the hipster Jonah.
1,How very sad.,"What we have here is simply a ""loser's squeal"" from an opinion writer who is seeing the national consensus turn against him. Rather than accept this setback gracefully and lay the groundwork for a comeback, he rages against the winning side. It's a unfortunate commentary on the author and the point of view he represents that he can muster no better counterargument than this compilation of name-calling and bile. How very sad."
3,Ominously Parallel,"I suggest that before anyone reads this book they read ""The Ominous Parallels"" by Leonard Peikoff first."
1,Are You people insane,"If I could have I would have gave this book 0 stars. This book is at best misguided and at worst propaganda. Fascism is a thing of the Right wing, the Left wing has communism, they are two different idealogical principals. The author also did an interview with John Stewart of The Daily Show which proved the author didn't know what he was talking about."
1,Liberal Fascism,"I bought this book on the strngth of a TV interview with the author. The interview was more interesting than the book, which is kind of pedestrian."
5,Excellent history,"I have know for decades that the predominant political trend in this country (as in most western countries) was toward fascism. While all my peers were calling those on the left socialists, I always understood them to be fascists. Mr. Goldberg has provided a wealth of historical detail to support that view. This is one of the most important books to be published in years."
1,Cherry picking history and ignoring facts,This book is a major disappointment. Especially since I looked at responses to this book and found a overwhelming majority of Historians and experts on the subject of fascism strongly disagreeing with this book.If you want a good book on Fascism look upThe Anatomy of Fascism
2,Pointless Sophistry,"With this book Goldberg is engaging in rather pointless sophistry and using rethoric to ""prove"" that liberals are really fascists. This is akin to saying that dog lovers are Nazis because Hitler liked dogs. He's obviously preaching for the choir here since those who are most likely to pick up and read this book are those who are out to find ""proof"" for their conviction that liberals are evil conspirators out to brainwash us and take away our rights and property and sell them to the United Nations. That being said, in spite of its dramatic title -- in itself worth millions in sales to the true believers, no doubt -- the content book is actually rather interesting and well written too, so that warrants two stars rather than one."
4,Very well-researched. Excellent perspective.,"The author has done a very fine job of researching and tying historical perspective with current day vernacular. Today's liberals call anyone who disagrees with them a fascist. It's kind of like a dog calling a eagle a ""canine""!My only constructive criticism of this book is the occasional length of some parts - for example, the chapter on Mussolini seemed endless. I got it - he was smart, egotistical, and Hitler's pawn. Move on.Overall though, well done and deserving of some of the fine reviews he got here."
1,Oh please.,"Isn't it strange that today's American Neo-nazis are on the far right fringe? It seems that they would identify themselves and their hero with the left, doesn't it? It does if you believe the premise of this book."
1,A Plain Joke!,"As an avid reader, I have seen weird titles of books before, but this one thus far is the icing on the cake! The title, ""Liberal Fascism"" is one colossal oxymoron if I've ever seen one! Having been drawn,out of curiosity, by the ridiculous title while visiting my local bookstore, and thinking it was a work of humor and sarcasm, I promptly browsed through this book and after meticulously thumbing through and reading a number of pages, I arrived at the conclusion that, sadly nowadays, any idiot can get a book published. If you're a well-educated individual with a notion of world history, politics supplemented by pure logic and common sense,BELIEVE ME, this book is NOT for you!!!"
3,Liberal Fascism,"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of MeaningI have not read this book. But, when I do then a review will be submitted. Thanks."
5,amazing information,"The info in this book is amazing, I had no idea our history was so different than we were taught."
4,Liberal Fascism,"When a complex object is illuminated from a different angle, many aspects that were in shadow are made visable. Jonah Goldberg's ""Liberal Fascism"" shines a light on the American Left that helped me see now what was always there."
5,Most instructive book on the Left,"Never heard of Goldberg before I read this book. I had the wrong idea about it before I read it. I thought it was going to be a far rightest attacking the Left. I figured the smiley face was a gimmick. Instead, it turned out to the most instructive book I've ever read on the Left from Marx to Obama. Now I get it because now I understand the history of liberalism, progressiveism and all the other we-will-bring-about-utopia-here-on-earth-now isms that are out there. Goldberg is a great writer."
5,A Well Researched Piece,"The author has really done his homework and writes an interesting book. At the very beginning he goes on a little long with an introduction, but then the book moves along at a better pace. Herein is illuminated a clear articulation of a modern conservative perspective. If you want to have some great discussions about world views this book would be a springboard, or if you are a history buff you will find illuminations on past events that may cause a personal paradigm shift. Personally, I didn't care for the reader. I've listened to a lot of books and I didn't like the way he pronounced some of the words, but then he is from Great Brittan. Overall, I was very glad I read this book, and I recommend it."
1,A Book of Filth and Lies,"How far will the right sink with its revisionist history to win the hearts of its real Fascist followers (skinheads, doctor murderers, and religious fanatics who distort Christianity)? This book is pure revisionism backed up by distorted facts to fit the author's ideology. Individualism pushed to the extreme recognizes no public good or common goals among a people. It fails to recognize that the free market individuals who benefited most from economics based on individual self-interest hurt the most responsible individuals by destroying our faith in a free financial system. Enough already. The Reagan era is over. Quit your frenzy and find a new ideology. Or at least a new practicality. Your ideological extremism is what brought the right to its knees -- hopefully to stay for the remainder of my life."
1,Some simple questions for your consideration,"First, for a lengthy and balanced review, check out the Washington Post's analysis.Second, we can cut through a lot of this mumbo jumbo by looking at the attitudes of conservatives vs. liberals.So, how do conservatives feel about gays? Be honest now.How do conservatives feel about immigrants? No excuses.How do conservatives feel about legislating ""morality"" (their version)?How do conservatives feel about corporate interests vs. those of the individual? Not rhetorically, but in terms of voting behavior time and time again.How do conservatives feel about the seperation of church and state? If left totally unchecked, would there be one?Answer the above honestly, and the answer will magically appear! Warning, some cognitive dissonance my occur. Feel free to retreat into denial, shallow patriotism, and strident jingoism if the sensation is too intense."
1,Reading this book was a total waste of my time. It's absurd.,"I did read this book; and I have read many, many others about fascism. The author obviously hasn't read much about his subject and even more obviously does not understand the textbook definition and description, as well as history, of fascism. For a real book about fascism, readers should read Chris Hedges' American Fascists - Hedges is so intellectually superior to this author as to make this book laughable. I'm glad I didn't buy this book (got it from the library) so as to help support this guy who, I am sure, is making a mint off right-wing hysteria. I am so sorry that a major publisher would have anything to do with this venture - which obviously is just a money-maker for the author. Whatever sells, right?"
1,Goldberg bit off more than he can chew,"The blog writer Goldberg has a lightweight grasp of history. He cherry picks facts to fit his needs instead of trying to see the true picture of lineage in the political spectrum. It is specious to think that modern progressive movement has any lineage to Mussolini. Goldberg tortures facts to get them to fit his fantasy.The reality is fascism makes Goldberg uncomfortable. And thats because it's true home is in the close neighborhood of his own neocon ideology.If there was a thread of interesting conjecture, I'd pass on criticism. But I only see a polemical tract dressed up like a small college term paper."
5,Important work,This scholarly work shines the light of truth on the subject in such a way as to finally make sense of a reality that has been muttled in the back of your mind. One of those rare insights that cause complete illumination to to a darkened reality. Best book of the year.
4,Important reading...,"Goldberg's book wanders from time to time and there are parts that are hard to follow because of this. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book. Goldberg correctly identifies fascism as a left wing movement, a fact that most do not seem to recognize. He exposes the continuity of thought from the so-called progressives a century ago to the so-called progressives today. While identifying similarities between fascism over the last 100 years and today's liberals, he takes pains to insist that he is not saying that today's liberals are just like Nazis (in contrast to some of the other reviews you may read). This is a thought-provoking and enlightening book. Hopefully the skeptical will be motivated to learn the truth."
3,Informative.....and that's it,"Liberal Fascism is a very informative book that did indeed open my eyes to the progressive fascism of Woodrow Wilson and FDR, but reading felt like a nightmare that I could not wake up from. Jonah Goldberg often uses different languages to make a point which makes this book hard to read and EXTREMELY boring. It is overall a terrible book to read. This book is informative, but nothing else."
5,A must read!,"This book is a must read for every political science major, political activist, and politically active American. An excellent read!"
1,Submission to authorities are the problem,"The problem with Goldberg's book is that it ignores the fact that fascism isn't a product of liberalism, but those of an authoritarian bent. Those who wish to submit themselves to authorites and say the government cannot be wrong and that to criticize one's leaders or government is unamerican have been fascist or communists or in betwen. The point being, they believed that the government and authorities must be followed. There is an excellent book by John Dean on this very subject. Unfortunately those on the right are much more likely to fit this criteria then those on the left though they don't have a 100% monopoly. I urge readers to look up his name on amazon search."
1,Idiotic bunk,"The title of my review says all that needs to be said of this . . . uhh . . . book.It is neither a scholarly treatise on fascism nor a scholarly treatise on liberalism, but, rather, a political rant whose Newspeak title purposefully misleads the general public into a false categorical association between two diametrically opposed political ideologies.You've got to be a true bunk-a-holic to give it any merit whatsoever.Read George Mason University's web site History News Network for a lengthy discussion that debunks Goldberg's bunk with articles written by the world's top scholars on the subject of fascism. Goldberg (sorry to break it to the foaming-mouth Obama's-like-Hitler whacko crowd) is not among them."
2,conservatives just love stirring up that hatred,"first, fascism is a right wing ideology.....not a leftist onethis book works the same way Cheney had 70% of american fools believing that Sadam and Iraq was behind 9/11, he kept using it in the same sentence over and over. this book was written to blame liberals for fascism, to stir up hatred, and is part of the current trend of anti-intellectualism and anti-reason running rampan in american society. To link liberalism and nazism just trivializes the holocaust, especially when Hitler killed liberals and leftistI can find simularities in two unrelated things too....take Hitler and Jesus.....Jesus was a great talker and so was Hitler...both were influencial and both still have a lot of people today looking up to them....so that must mean Hitler was a great leader then right? lolthis book is written by and for fools, anti-intellectuals, and people who hate america."
1,More WACKO than WACO,"Absolutely mind-boggling ... I have been a libertarian-minded individual for over 30 years and find this book an assault on logic, common sense, and libertine philosophy. How can a reputable writer like Goldberg create such an awkard and confusing thesis supported by inauthentic arguments? If you have any respect for yourself, steer clear of this hogwash. Goldberg's hurried and overstated reasoning reads like a freshman college student that can't wait to finish the assignment and go party. A looney and irritating book that I couldn't wait to finish -- which I didn't."
1,Funny Old World,"In the fifties there were many attempts to link Communism and Fascism with phrases such as 'Red Fascism' gaining traction in the US but not really anywhere else in the English speaking world. It seems Goldberg is into a form of revivalism with his arguments. There is no proper research under-pinning this book in the sense that he has found anything new, rather everything is de-contexualised and compared directly. The type of flawed logic at work reminds me of the examples of bad syllogisms given to us in high school : Communists are in favour of chjld labour laws, the Pope is in favour of child labour laws, therefore the Pope is a communist. . Try it yourself: Fascists believe in strong State Power, Liberals believe in strong State Power, therefore Liberals are Fascists""This is a totally worthless book by a cynical, worthless writer."
1,It's typical...,"It's typical, and not the first time the loony right has described any leanings leftward of their own insanity as something it's not. I alwas feel they address their mirror as they berate others. The current rants against Obama is a perfect example.And the old trick of using the Nazi's ""National Socialism"" as socialism to pad their claims just doesn't wash. You can title your regime anything, Peanutbutter...or Democracy, it doesn't make it so."
4,A great history lesson,"Mr. Goldberg is undoubtedly an intellectual and a thorough researcher, and his book is a worthwhile treatise on a difficult subject; but those hoping for a gripping Robert Ludlum-type writing style will be disappointed. The book requires studied attention and the occasional reread, but I found it worth the effort in order to have a better understanding of those seemingly intent on destroying the finest civilization ever conceived."
5,Liberal Fascism,"The author's reasoning is immediately sensable and well researched. The difficulty, as poiinted out by Jonah Goldberg, is that the term ""fascist"" is used for the enemy or adversary from many points of view. This allows the Liberal to skate, almost unnoticed."
1,CONFUSED propaganda,"Goldberg, son of the woman whose 15 minutes of fame was as a bit player in the Monica Lewinsky sex ""scandal"", is a right wing hack writer who has tapped into the far right conspiracy nonsense rampant in the US ... OF COURSE there are connections between political movements which are contemporaneous ... connections are NOT causation. the entire notion of liberal fascism is nothing more than a drug-addled product of Rush Limbaugh, just like feminazis. left is not right, up is not down. this only makes sense to those with no understanding of the intellectual history of 20th century Europe. Goldberg routinely pimps right wing ideas, like Coulter and the gaggle of writers who have specialized in stoking the fears of Americans. A measure of how crazy US culture is, just like the phenomena of The Rapture cultists. Bad history, illogical and grist for pulling the US back to the Gilded Age."
2,This concept is stupid,Both democrats and republicans are liberal facists in America because they serve the big corporate interest and big government.They are the same.And the MSM is just the propaganda arm of these anti-liberty jerks.Americans need to get off their lazy butts before it's too late.
1,holy crap!,"it never ceases to amaze me how many people on america's shores love to posture and conjecture about hitler, national socialism, etc. without ever really immersed themselves in the german culture. as one who has lived there and is married to a german and spent time w. those who fought in and lived through ww2 and who happen to be my in-laws, it's hard to imagine how this author could have come up w. the drivel that he did. but hey, in this day and age of sound bites, fear mongering, and obsessions w. this dark passage in history, it's easy to see how this book could actually pass for informative. if you want to contemplate the complexities of history and how such times affect us now, go to the library and spend time doing your own research. do not mistake this book as an accurate portrayal of history or an insightful perspective on present day realities."
5,A History Lesson and a Warning for the Future,"I have always been interested in history and remember reading many articles and books about FDR and the Depression. The opposition to the New Deal was usually painted as ""those rich guys just don't want to share."" Packing the Supreme Court I knew about, but not the realy reason for FDR's attempting to do this. How fitting that we are now living in the era of an ""environmental crisis"" where the people have to band to together and fight a new war. Hmmmmmmm, isn't this a basic premise of facisim? The need to rally the people, herd them like sheep to the pens where they will stand docile waiting for the elites to command them? What a timely book!!!"
4,"""Liberal Fascism"" a real eye opener.","This book gave me a real good look as to the direction that our government is leading our country. All concerned individuals living in the US should read this book just to educate themselves on what is going on within our government. If more people understood the similarities between our country and the European countries of the 1930's to 1940's, I believe that more Americans would be activily involved with making a positive change within our country instead of just complaining about what is happening. This book is a very good example of what could happen if we do not stand up and question why our government is doing what they are doing. A must read book for all High School Seniors to give them a better understanding of what's going on today and the future of their country."
1,Fantasy and word salad from a twisted person,It is a benefit of free society that sick a propagandist can write this stuff. It is clear that he could justify an argument that up is down and bad is good. It is too bad that people noted he was a fascist and he had to try to turn the argument.
1,Seek therapy,Seek therapy Jonah. You need it. As do the nutbags who read your made up garbage and see value in it.
5,Eye opening,"This is a great book. One that has opened my eyes to the dangers of grovernment if not in check. This book cleryfies what is Fascist, Communist, and Socialism and shows how American politics have meshed them into a ""nice fascism"". This is a great history lesson and a great arrgument against the expanse of govermnet power and the warpped view of those who know what is best for me, when they [Goverment] don't know me. Must read, highly recommended."
4,Revisiting a Dance Hit from the 1990s,"Campy dance act Army of Lovers won't ring any bells to mainstream listeners, but they did have an infectious club single in 1992 called ""Crucified."" Silly if not borderline blasphemous, ""Crucified"" is a definite guilty pleasure of a song that was well embraced by clubheads back in the day. Imagine Andrew Lloyd Weber set to a drum machine, and you may get the general idea. On this single, we get a variety of mixes; the best of these is the DNA remix, which gives the original version a welcome disco thrust. Add Army of Lovers to Technotronic, Robin S and Right Said Fred to the list of guilty pleasure dance acts of the 1990s."
4,A useful research tool!,"I remember the dread with which I first faced German genealogical records written or printed in Gothic script. It seemed like a completely alien alphabet. However, with a little practice and the useful examples in this book, you can decipher such records yourself.This book covers the Gothic alphabet and shows variations of handwritten script for each letter. It then provides handwritten script examples of common genealogical words and their German and English translation. Handwritten symbols and common abbreviations found in Germanic records are also covered.Sections are devoted to showing side-by-side comparisons of Latin, English, Danish, and handwritten German script for common genealogical terms, occupations & titles, and diseases. There is also a useful timeline. This handy book is spiral-bound."
3,"Simple, suitable for occasional use","A simple and effective package that gives you recharging capability virtually anywhere. Don't expect it to withstand rough treatment or daily use -- it's not quite rugged enough for that.Good value for money, great as a backup charger at home, in the car, in the suitcase/laptop bag."
1,Not for my bedside,"This book is not at all what I was looking for. It is mainly about the qualities to look for in a mate in medieval India. While it does have really pretty pictures, there are only about five and they are used over and over in the book. If you want to learn medieval dating techniques and attitudes towrads sex, then this is the book for you. otherwise, don't buy it."
4,Z525A,"Works Fine with my z525a, had no use for the software as PC suite was not listed for this model"
2,Hungarian Cosa Nostra with WW II roots,Decent story (sort-of) - I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if I could - Not all that well written or directed - and to see George C. Scott so obese was a downer - he should have taken better care of himself. Good suspense - unrealistic ending.
3,Scott is really a very good actor,"A liked of this film only by George C. Scott's work. The history and the other actors are good but Scott makes the difference. He is a strong and imponent actor, and change the manner to see any movie. If you like George C. Scott, i recommend this movie."
5,Dainty-More please,"A dainty, classic design piece and I would have liked matching earrings. Good color but a bit on the small side."
3,ADJUNCT PROFESSOR'S PRIMER,"If you are a new adjunct professor, or about to become one, this book offers good advice and excellent insight into how to survive and excel as a novice. If you have experience, it's not for you. I wish I would have had this 4 years ago when I first dealt with the issue of students contesting grades. I'm seasoned now, and I can confirm that the information in this book will prevent, if not reduce, the likelihood of rookie mistakes. That alone makes it a worthwhile purchase. It would make a nice gift for a first year colleague."
3,Good for a remake,"I've always like Lana Turner and she does well here as a 'classy tampy' kind of woman. RAINS OF RANCHIPUR will not go down in history as a great film by any means and it's not Richard Burtons best by a long shot. He seems a little bored by the whole thing...and until the big rains come, an audience can become a little bored as well. Ending differs from the original THE RAINS CAME, but the premise is the same. The movie is done up in Fox's CinemaScope and stereo sound with second unit locations. Doesn't look like the stars ever left the sound stage at Fox. Fred McMurray is quite waisted in this as is Joan Caufield in a convoluted second romantic plot line that could have been left out. So if one likes Turner, the look of the 50's film making, see it. If not, catch something else."
3,The Rains Of Ranchipur from Amazon,"It was a movie I had seen quite a few Years ago and Loved it, the only thing I could not hear it on My Kindle Fire the sound was so low.But the picture was clear and the colors were beautiful.If I can`t hear the sound the movies are no good to Me.There were several I was going to order but now. PeggyDON`T PUT MY LAST NAME OR MY ADRESS ON THE COMPUTER WEB."
5,I'll rain on this parade.,"If you find adultery entertaining, or you want to see Richard Burton smeared in semi blackface you might like this one. It plays like a Hemingway story lots of philosophysing about nearly everything. The high point of the movie is the earthquake during the monsoon. A dam above Rancipur breaks creating and interesting situation. If it were not for that, this would be a hilarious bore. Not exactly family entertainment."
1,Terrible,"These definitely are not the ORIGINAL recordings. Kitty is in terrible voice. She sounds like she is singing with food in her mouth. There is very little emotion in her delivery and the instrumentation sounds mechanical. This collection is no way to remember a great singer. For a somewhat lowerprice you can get the Decca Country Music Hall of Fame reissue. That anthology contains 16 original hits. Also some import labels like Jasmine and HUX have reissued some of the early albums. The best single CD ""Gods Honky Tonk Angel"" was issued by Edsel but may be out of print. Stay away from this piece of crap. Less than one star."
2,"Greatest Hits is right, but NOT The Original Hit Recordings","I echo the reviewer who alerted us to the fact these are not the original hit Decca recordings and thus do not sound the same - buyer beware! It IS the best collection of Kitty Wells hit records I have seen on CD, so that makes it all the more unfortunate the recording company could not pony up the bucks to use the real (read ""Kitty's voice as originally recorded"") hit recordings. There has never been another Kitty Wells!!"
2,Honest personal opinion on the Cole Porter Gift Set,"I was very disappointed and feel that the only DVD worthwhile in this set is ""High Society""--that deserves 5 stars! The other DVDs lack the quality and better-known Cole Porter song content. I would recommend buying High Society by itself, which, ironically, was my initial intention."
5,A great textbook for health class!,This health textbook covers the subjects of and surrounding human health. From reading this you can learn how to achieve a healthier lifestyle.
3,My new Cadillac,"I love my new cadillac iron in theory,However....like a cadillac, it must be well treated.* Never let it overheat (which it will do easily) and touch a synthetic. You will spend way too much time trying to remove residue from the soleplate. They sell a remover for a good reason. However,[…] sheets also work*Keep it moving while you iron because getting it back to cruising speed/heat after it shuts off automatically is the work of an experienced driver."
5,Rowenta steam iron,"Rowenta DZ5080 Focus Stainless-Steel 1700-Watt Iron. The iron is working perfectly, my wife is very pleased with the iron. I will shop with Amazon again."
1,rowenta effective drips,"I am about to send back this iron for the 3rd time, when they send the shipping label. The customer service rep says they are new irons each time, but I doubt it.The irons drip, no matter what type of water I use. This gets the clothes wet and the ironing board cover wet. It is hard to finish a couple of hours of ironing because the board cover gets wet and I have to stop until it dries or it keeps getting the clothes wet.Very frustrating."
1,Terrible Iron - Leaks Like a Sieve,"I think all the glowing reviews about this iron must be from people who have only owned it for a short time. I LOVED this iron while it worked--which was for all of about six months. Now water POURS out of it every time I plug it in. This is not a leak, it's a full-on deluge, and the iron is useless. Ridiculous, considering the amount I paid for it. Don't waste your money."
5,Great Product - Don't Listen to the Idiots,This is one of the best irons that you could buy. Try it for yourself and don't pay attention to the negative comments. These people probably tried to iron their clothes while wearing them. Idiots!
1,Bad Iron,I am sure Rowenta makes good iron but I now feel that amazon may be gets the worse of the lot and sells it online. Any electrical and electronic products that I have bought recently just does not work the way it should. Water leaks through this and I have burned myself with the steam so many times. I doubt that Rowenta's product and bad but I somehow feel that Amazon gets this rejected stuff from manufacturer and sells them online on the site.
2,"WAS great, then the LEAKING began!","My husband and I loved this iron- the design, the numerous steam holes, the way it glided over fabrics- and then, the LEAKING began. Profuse leaking. It started after approximately one year- we would find huge puddles of water under the iron on our counter where we left it over night. It would spill puddles on to clothing after a few minutes of use. Please, understand: we did NOT overfill it with water, and we did NOT put in distilled water, either. We followed all instructions exactly, including cleaning the iron out to be sure there was no blockage- the iron just started malfunctioning. Thankfully, we purchased it from Bed Bath and Beyond- they ALWAYS accept returns on defective merchandise with your receipt (I kept ours!). I would probably NOT buy this particular brand again."
5,finally,"After purchasing 3 expensiveish irons and hating them - leakyness, breaking waaaay too easy, not working... I finally splurged and purchased this iron.Holy cow. This is the most amazing iron I have ever used. I almost like to iron with it. But - the steam will burn you if you aren't carefull, and it is really light so I now have a burn on my inner forearm from tilting it in while not paying attention... Worth it though for the amazingness of the iron."
4,Recommend.,"It would be helpful to be able to regulate the amount of steam. When the steam is on, there is a constant gush of steam. Great for stubborn wrinkles, but not always necessary and requires frequent refilling with water."
1,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to my new iron. Unfortunately, the indicator lights did not work (yellow for heating up, green for right temp, red for too hot for setting). When I tried using it anyway, it was nice and hot, with lots of steam, but it also leaked all over the place. Oh well.....back to my search."
2,It Leaks!,"I read reviews of this iron that reported the iron leaked but thought there had been a bad batch, since the review was a while back. I received my iron and on the first use it leaked when using steam, and when pressing the ""burst of steam"" button, water streamed from under the soleplate at the top of the iron. Since my purchase was past 30 days by the time I used it, I had to return it to Rowenta. I will have to wait to see if they repair or replace it and if this solves the problem or not. I'm not optimistic about the outcome at this point!"
5,"Steam, Steam, and more Steam","I love this iron. This brand was recommended to me by a fellow coworker. I never knew that you can actually iron your clothes without starch, pass the iron over it one time, and they will look crisp and sharp. This iron definitely uses alot of water but much cheaper than using a spray starch. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,Wish I had known the size of the iron,I have always used a holder for my iron and ironing board (an all in one holder)which is attached to the back of a door. I was unhappy that the iron is too big for the holder - if you had one that held this iron I would purchase it. I would appreciate a reply. The iron is far better than a less expensive iron. Thank you.
2,"Bad Placement of ""Precision Dial""","I love everything about this iron other than the placement of the ""easy to use"" precision dial. It may be too easy to use. I brush it with my hand *every* time I reach for the iron and guess what, it changes the setting I'm on. Oh, I forgot to mention there's a handle in front of the dial, so if you want to double check what setting your own, be prepared to put your face close to it, and read at an angle.I haven't thrown it in the trash--the results from ironing are phenomenal. I've just been frustrated one to many times and needed to let other consumers know about the major pitfall of this iron."
1,"Water works.....not the game, a leak.",I purchased this Rowenta less than a year ago...it is my second Rowenta in the last three years. I love them at first but they do not last for the price you pay. The first one started staining clothes. This DZ5080 just started leaking water all over the place. Not just a drip but leaking so much the whole ironing board was soaked. What is happening to the reputation of this once giant in its' field? I just purchased a T-fal for $40 so am hoping it last longer...
1,Not reliable,"My wife has had two Rowenta's now. Each one has lasted a year or so. Unacceptable. They are good iorns, she says, but why pay this much money for such poor reliability."
4,Rowenta Iron,"It is the best iron I've had since the old fashioned Hoover brand of the 50's. It is smooth an weighty and gets into tight corners without fuss. My only complaint is with the cord. It is always in the way when setting the iron upright between items. I'm sure it will wear in time and give me trouble in the future. For the price, this ""bug"" should have been obvious tot he designers and worked out long ago."
2,"High hopes, short lived...","I bought this iron for my wife for Christmas a year and a half ago after reading all of its glowing reviews. Sure enough, it looked beautiful and worked well except for the occasional water leaks. Sadly the leaking started to grow progressively worse and now less than 18 months later the iron no longer holds water and has shorted out. I thought irons were one of those things that lasted for 10+ years when you bought a nice one. If that is also your expectation, this is probably not your iron."
1,Not such a find!,"I don't know if I qualify to write a review since I picked up my Rowenta Focus DZ5080 at a rummage sale. I was thrilled to come across this iron in perfect(I thought)condition as I was helping to set up our church rummage sale last week. Macy's was even advertizing it in their current circular! What a find! I have been using and loving it...until today. This iron must be one of those that leaks right there by the cord. The cover on my old fashioned wooden ironing board is soaked. I would go buy a new Focus but it seems that leaking is a common problem with this iron. Rowenta, are you listening???"
2,Not happy wth Focus iron,"I'm so disappointed in the Rowenta Focus iron. Since I'm a quilter and I use the iron almost daily, I really wanted a good steam iron and thought this one would be it...wrong...it leaks all over! I constantly have water spots on my cover (which, incidently is also a Rowenta), even if I hardly have any water in it.It also seems to run out of steam fast. At first I just thought..well, I must have really got a lemon...my husband has told me it needs to go back to the store.This is the first negitive review I've ever written; but I thought people should know and beware."
2,Product rating,"It was necessary for me to send the iron to Rowenta authorized service in Illinois. I only used the product twice and both times it leaked water. I had to pay for shipping the product back for repair/replacement. It will take two plus weeks for the iron to be returned to me. Hence my satisfaction rating is quite unsatisfied. I thought Rowenta was a quality product and my purchase was at the high end, not an in-expensive iron."
5,Very Pleased,"This is my second Rowenta in 10 years, purchased this one for my vacation home. As expected, I am very pleased with it. It heats up fast, creates lots of steam and makes ironing even 100% cotton a breeze! I especially like the super-pointed nose, sneaks right into those tiny crevices with ease!I'm one very satisfied customer, this iron is definitely worth the price!"
1,Rowenta DZ5080 iron,"Had great hopes for this iron when I purchased it, even having read some of the poor reviews. Have used ONLY Rowenta irons for many years....the less expensive ones.....and hoped that this high-priced one would be that much better. Wrong! It worked well enough for the first couple weeks; the pointy nose seemed to get into much smaller spaces, and one filling generally did my ironing for the week. BUT...it soon started cutting offpower and was cold while I was ironing! After couple times of this, I decided to send it back for one with NO AUTO OFF, which is now costing $20. more than this one. Am hoping the new one works as it's supposed to."
1,Broken after 6 Months,"I bought this iron in December of last year thinking it was worth it to spend the money on a good iron, hoping it would outlast at least 3 cheap irons. In May it broke. The auto shutoff seems to have malfunctioned, and the iron won't turn back on after the shutoff has been tripped. I bought this specific version of Rowenta because it wasn't plagued with the auto shutoff problems of the others, but it's not true.In short, this then $90 iron lasted 5 months. Our $20 Black and Decker iron was the backup, and continues to iron after 3 years. I'm not saying that a cheaper iron is the way to go, I'm just saying DON'T BUY THIS IRON."
2,A Lemon,"Lots of steam and hot fast. The steam amount is not adjustable (only on or off). It sometimes drips water. Maybe I received a defective unit.After less than one year, water leaked profusely from the baseplate. I do not recommend this iron."
5,Does a great job!,"The Rowenta DZ5080 does a great job for me! It has a extra pointy top which makes it much easier to get in small areas like around buttons, which is a big plus. Overall, a great iron."
5,Rowenta DZ5080 Focus Stainless-Steel 1700-Watt IronThril,"Thrilled with iron. Nice weight, no spitting, great sole plate. Irons beautifully. Because it has some weight to it, I don't have to press down to get rid of wrinkles. Best iron I ever owned. Worth every penny!"
2,Great iron when it worked,I loved this iron up until the day it started leaking and would shut off automatically. I'm not an iron expert but for the price I expected better.
1,No longer works after 13 months,"After reading all of the great reviews, we purchased this iron to replace our old duct taped version. It was great until it stopped working 13 months later. Of course, Rowenta would do nothing about it since it was outside of the 12 month window. I'd rather buy the cheap versions if I'm going to have to replace it every year and a half. This was absolutely not worth the money."
4,Just short of 2 years,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this iron. It does a great job with ironing and is very easy to use. I have now had this iron over 1 year, but just short of 2 years. Now it is leaking water really bad and spitting out brown calcium dust on my clothes. If you are ok with replacing your iron every 2 years, then this is definetly an iron to consider. But for me personally, I went to the Rowenta to get out of the 2 year replacement cycle. Spending more money definetly did not work out well for me."
4,This iron works well but is a little heavy,"So far, I like this iron. The steam feature works well. It is a little heavier than my prior iron but I have not found this to be a problem. I wish that the cord had a retractable, automotic spooling feature like my previous iron. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
3,Not that awesome as all have noted.,"I thought I had researched enough. Everyone tells me that this would be a great buy and a great iron. To my sadness, after a few short months, this iron starting getting rusty on the iron, which in turn, makes your clothes dirty from iron stains. The iron does heat well. The iron does look good, but not the best stainless-steel used for the actual iron. I bought a different iron instead now. Thought Rowenta was the cadillac premier or all clothing irons...guess not!"
3,Focus vs other Rowenta range,"You can see a difference in pricing and reviews between Focus (lot of negatives) and Steamium/other Rowenta iron series. Note that other series carry the ""Made in Germany"" prominently. The Focus was a result of ""redesign"" i.e. this iron being made in China. Now you know which ""Made in .."" you would rather buy. :)"
2,"Leaks, leaks, and leaks","The water container is leaking and a lot. Otherwise it's a very good steam iron. I read people still use it even when leaking. It can be very dangerous. When the iron rests in the up position all that water leaks on the electric wires, so be careful to not be electrocuted. I would not recommend this product."
5,Smooth Gliding Ironing,"I love to iron anyways, but this Rowenta steam iron is a winner. It gets hot..real hot..that's the trick to liking to iron when it shows immediate gratifying wrinkle free clothes with out effort. Rowenta DZ5080 Focus Stainless-Steel 1700-Watt Iron"
1,no steam control,"This iron has no steam control. It is either full blast or off, nothing inbetween. It stains the clothes with brown water streaks. It has such power it often burns hands and fingers when pressing for sewing needs. If you are a home sewer or need to iron good garments do not buy this iron."
3,Good till it isn't,"I had this iron--the latest of several different brands, all at least serviceable--for about a year, and ordered a Panasonic (Amazon 5-star) today. While Rowenta knows how to make an iron with excellent features, this one spits; has a fairly small water tank that needs more frequent refilling than others I've owned; and now it's leaking from the cord aperture, with increasing severity, to the point where yesterday it all but drained its tank on the ironing board and floor while in the correct, resting upright position. (I answered the door for five minutes.) It irons well, the weight is suitable, the steam and water-jet work very well (though you can't regulate the steam as variably as w/ some brands). I just can't trust it anymore, and it's too soon to have hit that point."
1,Great iron- leaks like a sieve,"After 6 months of quite light use use (no children in household), iron has started leaking like a sieve. And to make matters worse, has symbol on side of iron saying ""anti-drip"". Still under warranty, but this means sending it off to service center and doing without iron for who knows how long."
3,Rowenta Focus Return,"Rowenta DZ5080 Focus Stainless-Steel 1700-Watt IronI received a Rowenta Focus iron as a gift and was thrilled. The large water capacity was fantastic and the steam produced was exceptional. Loved it - until 2 weeks after receiving it began to leak from the water reservoir. Not just a few drops, water continually dripped out.The iron was returned with no problem which was a blessing."
4,Great Iron,"Iron is very sturdy and the fine tip makes it easy to iron collars and around buttons. Heats up fast which helps if your in a hurry. Wanted an Iron that would hold the test of time considering my wife's 15 dollar iron lasted 10 years. People have experienced trouble with its longevity, but as a family we iron on occasion so hopefully we can get 20 years out of it. In-laws have same company and their iron is going on 7 years."
5,Fabulous Iron,I am so in love with this iron!!!! All those steam holes and so far into the pointy point...and the weight....excellent...It just has to come near the fabric and voila!!! it is wrinkle free (the fabric not the iron!!) Love it!!!!! I am so glad my old Rowenta (which I loved as well) gave up the ghost---with the help of being knocked off the table a few times!!!!
4,Rowenta steam Iron,"This iron is all I could ask for. It is light enough and allows a good amount of steam to press anything that I have doneI do prefer this one from Germany. Previously had one made in Mexico that didn't do as well,I find is superior."
4,Very good,So far this iron is great. No issues with leaking as others havementioned. Does put out lots of steam which makes ironing easier.
1,EXPENSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Expensive does not guarantee superior performance. Before I ordered the Rowenta DZ5080 I had purchased a T-Fal Ultraglide in August but much to my dismay, it is already leaking which prompted me to but the Rowenta iron in September. After using the NEW Rowenta for a couple of weeks, it too is leaking and it is worse than the T-Fal was. The iron gums up easily and does not like spray starch. The iron leaves large spots of water on the clothes. There is so much water leakage that it leaves puddles of water on the floor and the ironing board cover soaking wet. My old cheaper Black & Decker does not leak after many many years of service. Less is definitely more when it comes product satisfaction. My ONLY recommendation for this product would be DON'T waste your money!"
1,Handle burst in flames,"I really like this iron and have used it for at least 4 years. However, water must have leaked into the handle where the cable attaches to the iron itself and burst into flames. Luckily, nobody was injured. This iron had cut my ""average"" ironing time by close to half. Now, I seriously doubt we will spend $100 for a Rowenta. None of the cheapy charlies I had bought before ever burst into flames. I will not recommend this appliance to anybody."
1,Constantly leaks after 14 months of use,"I've purchased and used the Rowenta DZ5080 Focus since March 2010. It performed very well for the first 11 months or so, then started a slow leak somewhere near the baseplate. Now at 14 months, it POURs from the baseplate. Unlike what others may think, it was never overfilled, and I only began ironing once it had heated up (the yellow light disappears).I truly liked the product initially, but have to give it a 1-star rating because of its very short life span. As a comparison, my old Black & Decker lasted years without any issues (although its performance was lower than the Rowenta).For those of you who believe there is a quality difference between irons manufactured in Germany vs. China -- mine was manufactured in Germany."
4,So far so good,"I've had this item for about a month; I took a chance on another Rowenta even though a less expensive model died after only a few years of service. But since that may have been due to it being dropped a couple of times, I gave Rowenta the benefit of the doubt, and bought this one because I really wanted more professional ironing ability. So far it has been a delight and I especially love the pointy front that gets into those hard to iron places on shirts and pants. It does go through the water quickly but I have not had some of the spitting problems other reviews have mentioned. But while I was waiting for this to arrive, I borrowed a friends basic Black and Decker, which worked very well and made me wonder if the extra $60 would be worth it. Be that as it may, I' so far satisfied with this purchase and only hope that it has durability."
4,So far so good,I've had this iron for a few weeks and really like it. I haven't had any trouble. It is a little heavy but worth it.
4,Rowenta DZ5080 Iron,This is an excellent iron. My only complaint is the weight of it. Extremely heavy.
4,Great Iron,"This is a great iron! It does everything they say it does. Lots of steam, irons with ease, not too heavy. The only problem I have is for some reason my fingers will accidently spin the temperature select dial. It spins quite ealsily. That could stand to be harder to move. No regrets, I would buy this iron again. Amazon had the best price by far."
3,Nothing extra for price!!!,"Hi,I bought this iron about a month ago through this website and is happy with its performance. I use it daily to iron at least 2-3 clothes.Though this iron performs well, I would say that there is nothing special with this iron as compared to other cheaper ones. Before this I used an iron from GE that cost about half as much as this and performs the same as this.I think that if you don't use the extreme hot settings, than any iron would do the job well - ofcourse if it's not a 10 dollar item.It has 400 holes in its plate, but that didn't seem to impress me while ironing different textures. Similarly, the pointed nose is okay, but you wouldn't want to pay double the price for that.The iron is heavy.One suggestion would be to not use the iron on the extreme hot settings, as it may heat up and destroy your clothes.If you need an iron for a general day-to-day use, then I would suggest that you go for a decent iron with much lesser price.Thanks!"
2,What a leaker!,This was our second and last Rowenta iron. Both models we purchased ended up leaking everywhere after about a year of use and just out of date of the warranty. I just expected an $80 iron to have a better life span and it really is too bad because when it wasn't leaking everywhere it did a great job.
2,Too much for too little,"These irons don't last. My 2nd one just went in a little over a year. Same with the first. I wouldn't be upset if this was a $30 iron, but come on folks! I liked it when it worked, but it's just not a reliable appliance. If you are thinking of buying Rowenta, you need to go into the purchase knowing you'll be back for another one in a little more than a year. I am a single guy, so over use is definitely not the problem! I will probably end up buying a 3rd one just because I love it when it works. Kinda like owning a forgein sports car!"
1,Very Disappointed!,"I've wanted to replace my old iron for years and finally broke down and went for the Rowenta Focus. It's going back today. I didn't have a problem with leaking, but the LED which is supposed to turn green when the iron is ready based on the temperature you select on the dial glows red at all times. I was ironing a white cotton comforter cover and was scared that I would burn it because I couldn't tell how hot the iron was. I don't know, maybe mine is defective but I wasn't impressed with the functionality at all. My old one that I probably paid less than $20 for works better than this one. I'm going to try the Panasonic cordless."
4,Catching a vicious serial killer,"This is a fascinating detective story that happens to be true. It would be hard to write a dull book about Andrei Chikatilo, but the way the author drew his characters really gripped me -- as did his horrific examples of the corruption and incompetence within the Soviet criminal justice system, which among other things lead an innocent man to be convicted of one of Chikatilo's murders and executed.A word of warning: the book is as much about Inspector Kostoev (who was in charge of the task force to find Chikatilo and who eventually wrung a confession out of him) as it is about Chikatilo and his crimes. It goes into great detail about Kostoev's background, childhood, etc. I found it all very interesting but others may just want to read about the murders. Most of the Kostoev biography can be skipped if you really don't want to read it."
2,an advertisement for professional services,"How to Hire a Nanny is essentially a book-sized advertisement for GTM payroll services. The take-away from this book is that you ought to get professional help with taxes and the like if you want to hire household help. I actually use GTM household payroll services, and I am pleased with what they offer. As for the book, it will help you understand the many 'gotchas' in hiring help."
2,Not what I was looking for,I didn't like this book. It did a great job of explaining the legalities tied to hiring a nanny but I was looking more for tips on recruiting and what to look for etc. If you're planning on starting your own nanny placement agency then I would definitely suggest this book. But if you're just looking for some good advice on how to hire one on your own I wouldn't suggest this book at all.
5,Best 'How-To' Guide EVER!!!!,"This was the best book ever, it gave you every possible scenario, answered every question before you asked it and even helped me create applications, job descriptions and a work agreement. wonderful tool!"
2,Diappointed,"Isabel's Bed looked like a great read & it's gotten great reviews, but in all honesty I was diappointed by it. The writing is great, I would give Elinor Lipman 4 *'s for her writing talent, but this story just never took off for me. Harriet Mahoney is a 40 something year old woman who finds herself alone after her live-in boyfriend of 12 years meets someone else. An aspiring writer, Harriet takes a job working for Isabel, living in her mansion & helping her to ghostwrite a novel about Isabel's scandalous life. Where this book fell short for me was in the character development-I never got to know or care too deeply about any of the characters. I will still give Lipman's other novels a try as she is a talented writer. This novel wasn't terrible, but I felt it was a little flat."
2,Rather disappointing,"I read The Inn at Lake Devine and enjoyed it so decided to try other Eleanor Lipman books. The reviews here were all very favorable so I gave Isabel's Bed a try. I'm surprised to 'report' that I was quite disappointed. There was no real development of characters and the plot twists seemed contrived. The relationships were there on the page, but about as flat. Without giving any of the storyline away all I can say is I really didn't 'know' any of the characters even by the end of the book. The end was a bit abrupt too, though I'm not sure what may have been left to say.As a light summer/beach read it's not too bad but fell short of my expectations by a long shot. I have another Lipman book to try (Then She FOund Me) so we'll see :-)"
1,Fluff and Fickle,"If you're after a quick light-hearted read this one may suffice. Be warned: Isabel's Bed is crammed with sterotypical, over-exaggerated characters whose predictability becomes palpable with every page. The heroine of the novel, Harriet Mahoney, is filled with so much self-pity and lack of confidence you feel like slapping her and screaming ,""Get over yourself."" I had no sympathy for her constant self-undermining drivel. Harriet shacks up with Isabel, in order to ghost write her life story. Isabel seems to have ten-fold of everything Harriet lacks. One can only assume her brash, self-righteous behaviour are attempts at keeping readers amused. But Isabel merely grates with her self-indulgent comments and pathetic fashion sense. Other characters, mainly men, are again sterotypical and unbelievable. The storyline itself is uninteresting and trite. If you can find it at half-price, Isabel's Bed may be worth it---just."
4,"entertaining, light read that will make you smile!","I was looking for a light read for my morning commute on MUNI and I must say that this book was very entertaining. An easy read, you get attached to these four characters, and quite often I found myself laughing out loud!"
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"If you're hungry for a good read, this book might leave you feeling like you've eaten a sack of day-old bagels. The book is heavy on cliches, and in the end, you wonder if it was worth your time. The story has potential, but lacks character development and the location of Cape Cod is completely wasted as the author does not bother to elaborate on anything in a descriptive way that would really give the reader a feel for the charm and beauty of The Cape. As the character Pete might say ""Why botha?"""
2,Not great,"Poor storyline made it boring and I never loved the characters, as I almost always do. Not a favorite."
4,A delight,"I read this book from start to finish whenever I could when I moved here to Wellington temporarily after the Christchurch earthquakes - it's been ages since I read some fiction and felt like I needed something light to bring down my stress levels. But not fluffy or chick littish.Isabel's Bed was perfect: witty, great characters, especially the women including the murderess, and a nice pace, and yes, I loved the ending."
2,Not Good,"This book looked interesting enough to read, but by about page 40 I knew the plot was not going anywhere. I'm not sure how this book got such great reviews! I could not even finish it. I ended up reading ""The Glass Castle"" instead,which I would recommend to everyone. Made this book seem all the more silly and boring. I just couldn't ever get into the characters or with what was going on with the plot. Really a waste of time!"
5,A superb escape!,"I could not disagree more with people calling this book a ""disappointment."" I found it an entertaining, uplifting romp through two women's very different lives. I thorougly reccommend it!"
2,Let Down,"While I agree that the characters were easy to get to know and fairly well illustrated, I felt less than satisfied with the final chapters. With quite a bit of build-up to the main plot, it seemed the book then took a quick turn away from the plot and the author quickly jotted an ending leaving me wondering what had just happened. There were loose ends, but what really bothered me is the time I invested in the plot, only to have it unravel with no real purpose. It was less a surprise ending than a 'why would you do this' ending. Lipman has done better, in my opinion."
2,Not that great!!!!,It started out okay. I kept thinking it would get better--it didn't. The characters were not that interesting. There were a few funny lines but nothing that would make me laugh till I cried. The story line was lame and predictable. When I finished it last night I threw it on the floor in disappointment.
3,Good read for an airplane trip,"This is good light reading with a not very comnplicated story line and not very complicated characters. The central characters are two women whose personalities and lifestyle choices are quite different. But many women could identify with one or the other. The men in their lives are not very well developed. The plot is fairly predictable, but it's sufficiently well written to hold your attention. A good read for a vacation or airplane trip."
3,Whose bed has her pumps been under,"In this book Isabel, was in the wrong place at the wrong time and has decided to write a book about it. Not knowing the first thing about writing she hires a ghost writer. The lives of all of the charterers intertwine in a weird set of events that lead everyone to find themselves a different place in their lives then where they started out. If you are the kind of person who reads the first ten pages of a book to see if they will like it or not then this book is defiantly not for you. The first chapter or two of this book are very boring and poorly written but like in the book itself the author finds their grove and it is well worth the read. I love the interaction between the characters and the personal growth that they all go through. I would recommend this book if you like, Chick Lit, romance or a bit of fun read when you have nothing better to do."
2,Good for the beach and an airplane - but that's it!,"This was a quick and easy read, but lacked substance and depth. It felt like a mindless ""trade romance paperback"" that one would read when they were unable to be near a t.v. and watch a soap opera. I'm really surprised this book is getting such high marks."
4,Fun summer read,"I read most of this book on an airplane, which is meant to be a compliment--I was captivated by the story not trapped with no other entertainment options. Lipman's characterization shines, a grand mixture of slightly unbelievable yet totally ""real"" and sympathetic people. I laughed at Isabel at the same time I loved her for supporting Harriet. The ending was the only part that bummed me out: Harriet needed a career counselor."
1,this was supposed to be funny...,"...but it wasn't. I kept thinking that it was about to get funny and then it ended. The author left ALOT of loose ends and it seems as if she just felt like ending the book, so it ended."
3,okay,"I kept waiting for the action to start in this book. It seemed like everything was working up to a climax, but it never happened. It was just too much talk and not enough action for me."
5,Lipman is a true wonder,I very much doubt there is a novel by Lipman which is anything short of wonderful. I've read her latest two books and everyone recommended this one. I am so glad I bought it - every character has facets that develop artfully and with great tenderness before your eyes. She is a master storyteller. Read everything she writes.......
5,Royal treatment by Concertgebouw,"Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra is captured in a 1960-1970 Anthology in 14 CDS that has some world famous conductors, some famous and not so familiar compositions. I liked Verdi's Falstaff and most of the Germanic composers. There was a British Britten and American Varese. I have trouble enjoying some 20th Century compositions though I have CDs by Siblelius, Ravel, Dutilleux, Hindemith, Shostakovich, Prokoviev, and Stravinsky. My pre-order for the 1950-1960 set may be hard to come by. I plan to travel to Amsterdam and take in the music venues."
1,Barely lasted 3 months...,"I actually came across these shoes on Amazon again because I am looking for a pair to replace them. I bought these in wide width from a specialty store. They offered me a great deal and I thought they were so comfortable. The shoes were tight but I thought they would ""break in."" By the time they broke in I had lost most of the foam because it seemed to melt to my socks/tights and come out bit by bit with every wearing. I actually lined the interior of the shoe with grip tape just to make them last a little longer. And the strap across the top never stopped feeling like it was practically breaking my foot.If you're going to invest the money, there are much better brands out there. It's a shame, because these shoes were so cute!"
5,"Versitile, comfortable shoes","These shoes can be worn with dress slacks and jeans. They look great with both. They are also super-comfortable. Anytime I know I will be on my feet all day, I am sure to wear these or the flat black pair that I bought last year."
2,Too clunky looking,The one thing I liked about the shoe was that it was patent leather. It ends there -- Much too clunky looking -- and didn't fit well. Certainly was not the comfort I was looking for.
2,Who Sized This Shoe?,"This shoe looked so adorable and I could hardly wait to get it! When the box came, I ripped it open and to put them on right away and much to my dismay I could hardly cram my feet into them. The length was too short and they weren't wide enough (I had ordered the wide width). I was so disappointed to have to send them back..."
4,Nice shoe - leather around heel a little tough,I bought these to have a semi-stylish walking shoe (not easy to find). Everything aside from the heel has been how I hoped. The heel is so hard be prepared for a blister or two.
4,Happy I ordered wide width...,"After waiting for these to go on sale, I took the advice of other reviewer's and ordered a 9W instead of my normal width size 9. I'm happy I did because these fit well and were even roomy. The egg crate cushion is wonderful, but does flatten down a bit over time. I have walked long distances with no complaints and have enough room to wear a pair of thick socks. I did get the comment from my boyfriend that they looked a bit clunky/orthopedic, but I wear them mostly with long pants or jeans. They give me the height I wanted without being uncomfortable. I would recommend these and go for wide width if your foot is not narrow."
1,An Absolutist's Monologue,"This is a classic example of a debater setting up a straw man, and not a very good one, and then proceeding to tear it apart. There is no explication of what the author understood relativism to mean, and which aspect or version of relativism the he is attacking. The use of an interview in which two fictitious names are used in place of the author is a trite too clever. I am not a relativist as in one who believes that everyone's views of morality is right whatever that view might be. Neither am I an absolutist in professing that morality admits of only one way of discerning it. Whether there is one truth or many truths, or none at all, is a matter that is still open to intense philosophical debate. This book adds little to that debate except confusion."
5,Kreeft does it once again!,"One of the best modern Catholic authors writes another great book. Kreeft's style is unique to most reader's not introduced to the Socratic method of dialogue. In easier to understand language, it means that the book is written more like a play than prose. Kreeft has two main characters, a Muslim absolutist and a liberal African American woman. The two debate, discuss and dialogue about all aspects of morality. Kreeft, as usual, is easy to read and yet remains challenging in his intellectual mastery of the subject. Kreeft makes difficult ideas seem easy and absolutely destroys every single argument in support of relativism used today.If you want to understand how modern man thinks and why he is so wrong in his thought-process, then this book is perfect."
2,"Not a refutation, but merely an affirmation","I am strongly Christian and reject ""relativism"", but this book is relativism itself. What Mr. Kreeft portrays as relativism is really the code of the new absolutes that are foisted on us at every turn. The true relativist in this book is 'Isa, Mr. Kreeft's supposed absolutist. Don't buy this book. Rather, get Watkin's New Absolutes."
4,...,"A good story with an unusual moral - at least, I've never heard ""Pay attention and THINK about what you're saying!"" presented as a moral before, although God knows it ought to be.No mousies are harmed in the reading of this story. My only real concern with it is that I have no idea how authentic it is."
1,"After the fire of ""A Fan's Notes"" a cold letdown","A Fan's Notes was so good, I should have known that the subsequent contributions would not hold up. I was correct. I found myself having a difficult time finishing this book. It was obvious Fred was struggling to recapture the magic of a Fan's Notes, couldn't do it, and acknowledged same in Notes from a Cold Island.The spontaneous hilarity of AFN was warmed over and forced in NFACI. NFACI (and the subsequent Final Notes from Home) only serve to demonstrate that he had considerable talent but it was wasted away in his losing battle with the bottle."
1,Bad Verse in the 1st Degree,"This is poorly crafted verse. I'm hesitant to refer to it as ""poetry,"" because it is anything but that. If you are an aspiring poet or searching for examples of erotic poetry, keep looking."
3,Great ideas!,This video had some really cool yo-yo ideas. The video could have been better and the music should have been better (whoever thinks that Roxy girl sounds good has no taste.) But if you pay attention to the moves you will learn alot. I think kids would like this video but it might be too hard for anyone under ten years. I have showed alot of my friends the stuff I've learned and they thought it was really cool.
5,Every Church should read this book,"Multicultural churches are not just more interesting, there biblical! The United States is a diverse melting pot. The Great Commission ""Go..to all nations"" has been made easier. The nations have come to us! Reading this book will give you a passion for seeing your church reach the nations in neighborhood."
5,Walker Muffler,"I purchased the more expensive Walker version for my 1999 Honda. Beside the extremely quick delivery I was heartened to see the part was ""MADE IN AMERICA"" and not a poor quality Chinese import."
5,TV series at its best,"As a long time fan of DH's I am pleased to have the 3rd. year on CD's. Now I can watch the shows whenever I have time, and without all those annoying commercials.Thanks."
4,husband,"The best gift you can buy for your wife / girfliend (your ""desperate housewive""). Third season is more sexy, funny and crazzy than previous ones. I founded some of episodes interesting also for me."
4,wonderful!!,"bought it used but it came in the packaging and everything, no one had even opened it. wonderful :)"
5,Fast Shipment!,Super fast shipment and item was in the condition it was described (like new). I have watched the entire season and didn't have any problems with the disc. In perfect condition. Thank you
4,Like this show a lot,"Season 3 of the most famous ""Desperate Housewives"" in the world is not my favourite. But, it is still good. Go ahead Marc!"
4,Muy buen comienzo,"Un buen cd tienes buenos temas muy al rock de los finales de los 90. Temas muy explosivos como ""don"" y ""cicuta"" en expressiones de que algunos no lo darian a demostrar.Canciones que te ponen a calentar la atmosfera de tu cuerpo y hormonalmente te pueden poner en un estado de ??? Cosa de escuchar el cd, temas muy buenos como; Como un perro, sed, ojos de angel y en la casa de los gritos."
5,Gandiosa musica,"empieza con un buen pie libido al producir este cd autonominado ""libido"". empiezan con ""don"" que posee una muy buena guitarra por parte de 'manolo', y ""cicuta"" que es una de esas que te hace saltar. ""Como un perro"" es la mejor cancion de este album por la combinacion del soft y hard rock que hay en esta cancion.""ojos de angel"" una muy buena cancion de rock seguida por ""libido"" que es grandiosa, es mi segunda favorita de esta album por la fuerza en que la tocan. LIBIDO ROCKS"
2,Derivative-standard-pop,"The main thing about this album is that I've listened their songs before (obviously, with different names). Libido has a good vocalist but they might increase their efforts in order to create songs with an autonomous personality. In my opinion, the band doesn't qualifies for the minimal standards required for a professional band, sorry. The two stars are because of a couple of decent tracks like ""Cicuta"", ""Don"" and the eponymous one (although it ""smells like Nirvana"")."
4,Damm BBC..!,"...They Screw Up Every Series, Brit Coms,Dramas, ECT..!....Offer 7,568 Different Combos.....Screw Em' I'll Bit Torrent..!.I Like Something Nasty In The Nursery Because Trevor Bannister Of ""Are You Being Served"" Fame Is Featured As Gordon...Trevor, Now 73 Lives In Surrey With His Wife Pam..Bless You Both..!"
3,Metabox Drilling guide,"The drilling guide comes with EXTREMELY limited instructions for use. The ""instructions"" are a series of pictures with no narrative. You are essentially left to figure it out by trial and error. I would bump it up a star or even two if it came with instructions of any kind."
4,Penguin Costume,"Ordered this for my 18 month old, and he is definitely a little long for his age, but it fit great. He made the cutest penguin ever!"
1,"Not Blue, Not Two","These glasses are clear glass. There is no hint of blue, or any color or variation -- just plain glass. Also, another reviewer said you got two for this price, but that is not true. It looks as if they originally came in sets of two, but they have been removed from the sets and repackaged in bubblewrap. (On the outside of each box: ""This is a set. Do not separate,"" but they are separated.)Each holds about 8 ounces."
3,"The Politically Correct, Ontariocentric Version","The book starts out with praise for Native wife-swapping and ends with praise for the National Energy Program. I'm not kidding.In fairness, there is a lot of competent history writing in between, but certainly not the authoritative version it claims to be."
1,Very cheaply made!,"We purchased two of these chairs for Christmas for our twins. Both of them deflated within minutes. What are the chances of two of them being defective? We were very disapointed. We went back and purchased the Dora fold out couches. More money, but durable and better quality."
2,not the best chair for a small child,"my 2 year old loves the looks of the chair and all, but it always flips over when she tries to get in it w/out my help. It does stay inflated well though."
4,Cute chair!,"I bought this chair for my 4 yr old. She loves it. Beware not to overinflate, or your child will topple over. Even though ours has since deflated (my daughter is a little rough) I am giving it 4 stars, it was fun while it lasted and inexspensive."
1,Start with his recent cds and work back .........,"I really like Eric's more recent work, but if you do too, beware this cd. His playing sounds like that of a young guy starting out and trying to prove how good he is. It shows great ability but lacks confidence.And his producers weren't doing him any favours - the high echo level just exaggerates his saxophone's shrillness when he's trying too hard."
5,"""For the Good Times"" is the best!","Even if every other song on this CD stunk (which they don't), ""For the Good Times"" makes it worth it. It is a beautiful ballad which brings me to tears every time I hear it. It was one of my grandmother's favorites."
4,Worth Hearing and Owning,"Like the reviewers here who panned this disc, I too prefer the 'original' honky-tonk Ray Price. If you are going to own only one Ray Price disc, this should not be your first choice. However, this guy has golden pipes and lends his folksy dignity to all of these tunes.This is a fine disc, and Price handles country 'pop' better than anyone I know. If you are a Ray Price fan, find a spot for this one in your collection."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This CD is horrible. Gone are the twin fiddles and honky-tonk sound. Known for his hitting high notes with perfect percision, Ray disappoints his listeners by having backup singers hit the high notes. The accompaning music is fully orchestrated and sounds like it should be backing Tony Bennett instead of country legend, Ray Price."
3,Can't recommend,"Liked Power Play, someone said this was better. I don't agree. Power Play had the advantage of being a unique recording with an underexposed talent, Onaje Allan Gumbs, who obviously put a lot of work and thought into creating an effective setting for Billy's one of a kind style. Most of these numbers are derivative, boring, and don't mesh with Billy's approach. Loose playing doesn't work with tight drumming. Grover Washington's playing on several numbers sounds like Wilton Felder channeling Boots Randolph. The only reason to get this is the extremely exposed solo drum number at the end, which shows Billy's playing to maximum advantage, but that's of little value for everyday listening."
5,The best TV has to offer!!,"The Sopranos is by far the most developed and cinematic show ever to be seen on television. The characters are incredibly in-depth and the plot is beyond that of any TV show and majority of movies. The world of the mobster is highly intriguing. The most fascinating aspect of it is that we can all still relate to many areas of that world. And, we can easily relate to the family life of Tony Soprano. The Sopranos is a masterpiece, and the chance to pick up these timeless works of art on DVD should not be passed by."
2,Minority Report,"The jungle was hot, the hero was hot, the heroine was hot, the sex was hot, the premise was not. I realize romance is fiction but must be a bit pausible. If our hero, Kyle, can stay away from a one weekend stand for 4 years why can't he, with numerous lives on the line, keep his zipper up for 5 days? Delanie was suppose to be the brains of her family, a scary thought. Why did she do everything possible to foil a mission, risking a lot of lives to do absolutely nothing of value? She hated playing the bimbo yet she did so without any prompting. I bought this book right after reading Kiss and Tell. What a disappointment, whereas in K&T the hero and heroine are both competent in H&S this is not the case. I'm still looking forward to ST John's book but I hope his heroine shows more common sense and likeability."
3,It took me four month to read it,"I loved Kiss and Tell, and read it in two days and nights, and was so happy to buy another one about the same brothers and sister. Alas, it did not make me want to continue once I began it, so I came back to it again and again, just because I had it.Pity, for such a good writer, who can write relationship so well, to do this book, where things seem factice, adventure pushed too far but not deep."
3,Hide and Seek,This book was so so. The plot was dragging and some of it not quite believable. But they wind up together and beat the bad guys. But there are so many people around all the time there is very little sex. So if you buy it do so for the detective story part.
3,Heroine lacking brains,"I am sure others gave the basic story outline, but I got very tired of the heroine, a kindergarden teacher, being eternally idiotic and putting herself and others in danger out of her sheer stupidity. I have no patience for stupidity when trained black ops agents tell her to stay put, she goes wandering and gets caught and tortured. She has experienced and witnessed the complete lack of morality and a love of cruelty, yet she continues to blindly put herself and others in danger. She proves herself to be an idiot over and over again. Ruins the story for me."
4,Doable,"This title represents my introduction to the powerful writing of Cherry Adair, and I have not been disappointed. Ms. Adair obviously worked very hard on this title--the story is tight, the characters have human failings and their sexual chemistry translates effectively. I had a little difficulty getting a bead on Kyle; I didn't know him as well as I would have liked to. Beyond that, this book is worth the money. You'll read it over and over."
3,Pretty good,I really enjoyed Kiss and Tell and was anxious to read Hide and Seek. H & S was ok but the storyline was not as good although it was fast paced. I guess I didn't like the characters. But the sex was sensational and hot. I enjoyed that alot.
2,Not My Cup of Tea!,"The story here is simple: Girls's sister is missing, girl goes to Vegas to find the last man seen with sister, girl goes to stay with man in South America to find sister. I was barely able to finish this book for several reasons but most prominent was that I found many things completely unbelievable. Such as.....how a woman (Delanie) could easily get so close to one of the richest men in the world in just a few weeks. How she would just happen to run into Kyle on a secluded mountaintop in South America?????? Etc. The sex scenes or interactions were not my cup of tea (particularly with Isabella). I'd pass on this one."
2,Not worth buying,We ordered this flute case for our granddaughter. When it was delivered we were very disappointed in the quality of the case and we have returned it. Unfortunately I neglected to read the other review of a previous purchaser - if I had I wouldn't have bought it.
1,NOT for C Foot Germeinhardt,"Main body section does not fit - at least 1/2"". Also an an older Olds does not fit. Newer Armstrong will fit so I have to believe that the case will only fit newer flutes and not vintage. Also the overall quality - hinges, weight etc are not up to this company's standards."
1,Somebody refund my money.,All me and my friends went to see this thinking it was gonna be a great movie before school started. Let's just say I'm looking forward to school now. I hate this movie a lot. It deserves no stars!
1,What?,"Freddie Prinze Jr. is the worst actor! She's all That was ok though. DUMB MOVIE OF SUMMER 2001: Summer Catch, Jeepers Creepers, Scary Movie 2, Jurassic Park III, What's the Worst that Could Happen, American Outlaws, and Pootie Tang.First off: The script ripped!Secondly: The acting was a bigger tird than what my gramps pops out!Thirdly: It is a copy of American Pie and Bull Durham put together."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,"First of all, the script is terrible. I have never seen a cornier movie then this. Secondly, come on, get some actors who can actually act. Whovever the main girl is, she is a total flake. Her acting skills are horrible. And Freddie Prince Jr. isn't that great in the first place, but this movie really just brought out the worst acting he is capable of. Do NOT go see this movie. Waste of time and money. I would rather eat cancer infested worms then watch this movie again!"
4,Teenage movie,"Great movie to watch with teenage children, Even though the characters are college aged. It has a drive to succeed in a professional world, the complications of relationships with a parent, etc. With the added bonus of first love."
2,Strikes Out,"Decent bubble-gum flick, but probably the worst baseball movie ever made. If there were a category for most clichés ever compressed into one film, ""Summer Catch"" would win it. Don't waste your time."
2,Jamie- definitely inappropriate for kids 13 and under,"Growing up in Cape cod, I've been to many of the college league games. However, the baseball games played in summer Catch are almost entirely ""unrealistic.""Freddie Prinze, Jr plays Ryan Dunne an emplowee for his fathers gardening business. As it turns out Prinze is a very gifted athlete. He befriends Billy BruBaker who is the comic relief as well as the most comical in the Movie. He also falls in love with Jessica Biel, She is very glamerous. I was not satasfied at all with the movie. In one scene Biels sister ask Lillard and Prinze to sign her baseball card. If I recall, the only time that the Cape league made cards was in the summer of 1988. but enough of the technical stuff. I was definitely embarassed when I saw a 7 year old girl. There are many sexual scenes in the movie which are not even suitable for kids of 13. I suggest you rent the movie. you'll get some laughs and somewhat of a taste of Cape Cod."
1,Pretty Cheesy .....,"A decent cast in the supporting roles, which is necessary to overcome the lousy script and general nausea from a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie. Mathew Lillard's performance earned this movie half of the whole 1 star I gave it. Nevermind the idea that a 6'6"" 160-pound catcher is ridiculous, I still think he's funny. The other half was simply because this is a baseball movie set in the New England area.Overall this is the typical Freddie Prinze Jr movie. What I like to call a ""teenie-bopper"" movie aimed at young adults with an attention span of about 15 seconds."
1,Terrible!,This is possibly the leading candidate for worst movie of this decade. For a real minor league baseball movie buy Bull Durham!
3,not all bad,"Contrary to some of the reviewers, this movie is not all bad and is not for baseball lovers only. I don't care for sports at all, but didn't mind seeing baseball as a backdrop. It was nice to see Jessica in a more 'adult' role and Freddie Prinz, Jr. is not one of my favorite stars on a good day, but you can relate to his inner struggle of known vs. unknown life choices. The scene where his two long-time friends put him in his place is a real tear jerker and worth the time to watch the movie. Glimpses of Mark Blucas (Riley, BVS) and Christian Kane (Lindsey, ""Angel"") were also treats. I don't know that I personally would pay for a copy, but check it out on tv and decide for yourself. It's worth a peek! A nice stress reliever after a hard day."
1,horrible,"this movie was disgusting! i hated it. the way they treat people who are overweight is shallow, and cruel. when the ""hot guys"" in the movie sit around and make fun of an overweight girl, thinking it is hillarious, are we really supposed to laugh? i watched this movie with a friend of mine, who is, overweight, and there was no mistaking the pain in her eyes when her favorite actor, Matthew Lillard made cruel and heartless fat jokes. it is not funny at all. i know the people in the movie are all actors, but why they would agree to do a moviein which overweight women are sought out, targeted, made fun of and ridiculed is beyond me. this movie is a disgrace. and it wasn't even good even if you could look beyond the prejudice of it. the plot was old, reused, recycled and tired, and unfortunatley the characters in the movie are horrendous."
1,Summer Flop,"I would rather catch a cold than watch Summer Catch a second time. Another movie about a guy who wants a girl who is out of his league....can you guess what happens at the end. Movie makers should be embarrassed by the lack of quality their products have these days. When we pay to see a movie, we are wanting something new that we haven't seen before. This movie just falls to the bottom of a list that includes a 1000 other movies just like it. Same story, just different characters. I highly do NOT recommend this to anyone who is not in love with Freddie Jr."
3,lawnboy does the rich girl in baseball?,"This movie is sort of a chick flick romantic comedy with a sports twist.A minor league start in New England for a localboy whose father has a landscaping businessgoes wrong on the first day.There are high jinx here with pools, pool, house mothers and bar room babes.The story/ plot line just isn't real original, the acting at times is pretty bad even at the character actor level?The result is pretty much an empty head comedy..."
3,"For fans of Freddie/Jessica, not baseball.","I normally wouldn't bother with a movie like this, but bought it for a buck in the midst of a Jessica Biel phase. It actually exceeded my expectations, though that's not saying alot. My main point is that it's not much of a baseball movie, but it's excellent for Jessica Biel viewing. Any film that has her swimming in panties I'd have to recommend to her fans."
3,It did redeem itself,"Well, I sat down with nothing else to watch and started watching Summer Catch. After the first 10 minutes, I almost changed the cahnnel. The first 10 mninutes were definitely the worst of the movie. Watching a young baseball player camp out in a sleeping bag with a girl so he would not miss the early (8:00) morning practice. Have you ever tried to sleep in broad daylight? You had to see it coming that he would be late, and that he would have her underwear. That being said, after that, it turned out to be a nice movie.The supporting actors did a good job, and it was a nice fun movie, it did not get too vulgar, and was fun to watch."
2,Poor Freddie!,"Is it me or does Freddie Prinze Jrs movies keep getting worse and worse. Fortunately Freddie saves all of these movies with his irresistable charm and likeablitity and only Freddie Prinze Jr fans will enjoy this movie. Summer Catch has to be his worse, and I have to say he is the only good thing about this poorly written, badly acted film. Jessica Biel lacks the energy needed and has no chemistry with Freddie at all. Matthew Lillard is rediculous, as he always is in films, as the loudmouth goofball of the team. Other cast members try hard but can't overcompensate for the weak script. Summer Catch has it's moments but nothing to great. Freddie Prinze is very charming and not a bad actor, he just needs to find the right film that can really show off his talent. Summer Catch is not it."
1,Too Much Sexual Content for a PG-13 Comedy!,"I watch a lot of movies, and I have seen only one or two PG-13 comedies with as much sexual content as this. I managed to ""bite the bullet"" and stick it out to the end, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.Hey, I'm extremely easy to please when it comes to comedy, but it really disappoints me to see SO much sex in a movie that's supposed to be funny. Bottom line: AVOID THIS MOVIE!Rent or go see something that's truly funny like ""Pure Luck"" or ""Johnny English"" or... I could go on forever-but I'd run out of room."
1,Awful!,"Where do I start. Let me first try to figure out what this movie was even about. I hated this movie. The acting was horrible, the story was predictible and it was not funny at all. I was looking more forward to it returning it to the movie store then to find out how things would work out in the end. Who told Jessica Biel (or whatever her name is) that she could act? Maybe I'm wrong about her. This is the first movie I've seen her in. But I'm not so sure I would give her a second chance. Most of the actors were annoying and not funny at all. Not even the one-liners!Baseball fans don't count on this to be a good movie. It's not. Don't waste your time.So don't count on this to be a humorous movie.I will not see this movie again. I'd rather watch ""Roots"" straight through then this horrible movie again."
5,A Cool Dry Place is excellent!,"I loved this movie. The acting was great, and I really fell in love with the characters. I especially loved the little boy. Vince Vaughn was great and should choose rolls like this in the future. I recommend this movie to everyone!!"
5,I love this movie!,"This movie is both touching and entertaining- the kind of movie that stays with you long after it's over. The characters and dialogue are very realistic, so it doesn't feel scripted. All of the actors are excellent in these roles, especially Bobby Moat, who plays Vince Vaughn's son Calvin."
5,The Movie is absolutely amazing!!,"There are a couple reasons why I highly recommend this movie. One of the most compelling reasons is found in the caliber of the cast involved. The acting job is quite spectacular, very realistic, and the story is very vivid and at the same time rough. Many times a director can't capture the audience's attention on ""Every day life"" type movies. In this movie, the director hit the nail right on the head! I would stack this movie up against ""Lord of the Rings"", ""The Matrix series"", ""Fast and the Furious"", etc any day. Bottom Line- This movie is genuine and a real piece of art work."
4,got here on time havent watched it yet,Dont really know how to rate it because i still havent watched this movie but i am plaining to real soon. I love vince vaughen so im sure it will be a good movie
3,Vaughan's devoted dad steals this small time drama,"""A Cool Dry Place"" caught my attention as it stars Vince Vaughnan, the talented actor from ""Psycho"", ""Clay Pigeons"", ""Swingers"" and the hugely underrated ""Return to Paradise"". Vaughan plays against type in this film as a devoted father, who is raising his 5 year old son Calvin alone. A spanner is thrown in the works, when Vaughan's character shows an interest in a local woman (Joey Lauren Adams - Chasing Amy), only to have his former lover and his son's mother (Monica Potter - Patch Adams) turn up unexpectedly on his doorstep. It's a nice little movie, that resembles bits of ""Jerry Maguire"", ""One Fine Day"" and even ""Stepmom"", and although not as great as the latter films, its a nice little video with good performances all round."
3,Devon Sawa,"Hi, I watch this movie because of Devon Sawa's part but became dissapointed at that point. Sawa is doing great acting in it, though. And the movie is pretty good. But this isn't a movie for Sawa fans."
3,Devon Sawa,"Hi, My name is Patrick Sjöberg. I watched this movie because of Devon Sawa's part but became dissapointed at that point.Sawa is doing a great acting in it, though. And the movie is pretty good.But this isn't a movie for Sawa fans."
1,What a let down!,"Very disappointed that this ""soundtrack"" is not in fact a soundtrack of the movie. This has to be a first in my experience. The film has so many nice numbers which i wanted to include on my ipod. What a marketing loss for the production company."
3,Expected more piano solos,"I just happened to catch the movie on cable a couple of weeks ago and really liked the piano solos. When I ordered this CD, I was expecting to hear a lot of this type of music. What this one contains is more orchastra/quartet music. If this is your interest, you may rate this one 5 stars.I thought Michelle Pfeiffer's ""My Funny Valentine"" was the best song on CD."
2,A Very Poor Job,"Grusin's a fine musician, sure, and the soundtrack does contain a couple of Michelle's numbers (and for that reason it gets two stars), but as Mr. Lundy noted, a lot of the musical numbers that were the real soundtrack to the film are not here. I didn't need every vocal, certainly, but the ""Ten Cents A Dance"" number where the Bakers have to temporarily cover the vocals, with Michelle Pfeiffer coming in when she recovers, was a must, as was some of the late-night piano noodling of Jeff Bridges' character. A couple of other vocals, already noted elsewhere by other reviewers, should also have been included. This needs to be redone. This movie is still enjoyed by many, and in large measure for the unique presentation of the music, since on repeated viewing the plot is certainly familiar. A shame, and a letdown for the fans."
2,"Good CD, but disappointing selection of songs from the movie",I was expecting a lot more vocal numbers and not so many instrumentals.It is a very strange selection of songs from the movie.
5,Fabulous,This is great whether you've seen the movie or not. I can remember searching the used music sections in NYC circa 1994 looking for it as a 21 year old au pair. Amazing tunes for every mood. The soundtrack is mostly contemporary jazz and piano with some classic jazz thrown in. If you enjoy this style of music you'll love it.
5,The Fabulous Baker Boys,"We've had The Fabulous Baker Boys video for over 15 years and always enjoyed the soundtrack. When I saw it for sale it was natural to want to have it for our car music system. Happily, it features the instrumentals rather than Michelle Pfeiffer (tho her singing wasn't bad, either)."
3,Movie soundtrack/Jazz/Pop,"The service at Amazon was great and the product itself arrived safely, but the soundtrack should have included more of the songs she sang in the movie....I really didn't need to listen to all the background music when the story was about a Jazz Trio and the songs they performed on the road.....where were all the songs Michelle sang? Most of them were missing!!!!!!!!!"
3,Should have read the reviews before I scooped this one up,"Okay, the heart of the soundtrack music is on here, but the riffs that make the movie what it is not. This is a canned studio performance that doesn't bear any resemblance to the live feel of parts of the film.If you just like the songs the way they'd be recorded, this CD might be okay. My preference would be to buy most of this material from the original artists if the soundtrack doesn't have the feel of the movie."
2,Very little Michelle Pfeiffer,"This should not be called 'soundtrack', the movie had a lot more Michelle Pfeiffer songs (and she is great!). Here there are only 2 of her songs, and way too much of Crusin (he is not bad, but he would not sell this CD by himself)."
4,"Rally 'round the flag, boys!","This collection showcases Johnny Horton's fantastic voice and wide range - he could sing it all, from stirring patriotic songs and historical mini-epics to moving ballads and even rockabilly. Of course, all the hits are here, like the irresistible ""Battle of New Orleans"" (which I listened to incessantly as a kid in the Sixties) and ""North to Alaska,"" to name two personal favorites.They just don't write `em like this any more, and more's the pity. You won't be able to resist singing along, I guar-an-tee it!I regret this collection doesn't include a sentimental favorite of mine, ""The Same Old Tale that the Crow Told Me,"" the flip side of ""Sink the Bismarck."" Despite that very minor quibble, this is a rousing CD, chock-full of unabashed pride and patriotism. You'll love it."
2,Pimsleur Express,I would not order the Express series again. The Quick and simple is much more geared toward learning. The Express CD mostly just gives you words to repeat and I ended up buying something else. I do recommend Pimsleur for language learning though.
3,Italian: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Express),Very good CD's I put them on my I POD and was able to listen while out walking. etc. It could have been much better if it had a Book to follow looking at words sometime makes it a lot quicker to learn.
2,Hawkwind - 'Masters Of The Universe' (Success),"As huge of a long-running Hawkwind fan that I am, this eight song compilation (to be fair) is strictly for completists and die-hards fans. I've seen this title in the cut-out bins at CD & DVD stores - when they still existed (in higher numbers) - such as Musicland, Camelot Music, etc. for like $2.99. To make it even more confusing, there are at least two other Hawkwind CD's out there with the same exact title. The disc that's been put out on the EMI label - then later reissued on the Dutch label Simply The Best is better - for it has the original ""Brainstorm"" album version. I would recommend that CD for sure."
1,Wrong 10- ISBN?,The 10-ISBN for this book is incorrect. It belongs to Incredible Islamic Scientists Volume 2 by Dr. K. Ajram. I have this book in front of me.
4,burst of energies ...,"i purchased this cd 15 days back .I read about kelly on website and decided to try it .music is wonderful and it really takes you deep , though for first two three days I felt bit uncomfortable after listening to it , may be because of theta waves , kind of vomitting feeling but after 3 days of listening I started enjoying it .And while I listen to second part with head phones I feel as if my heart is opening up , I can feel burst of energies coming out of it , though it has happened twice lets see what are future experience .rajesh"
3,Just music...,I would have preferred a relaxing talk to slow down and relax as I drift off to sleep. Also not so big on the Piano pieces selected... I would not have bought this if I previewed it first.
4,Subliminal CD,I am exploring and experimenting with the subliminal world and the jury is still out. I will say that I would buy more of Kelly Howell's products.
2,One time use bag!,"I do like the convenience of these bags, but they are marketed to be multiple use and every one I have used breaks (typically at the seams) after the first use. They are handy, but perhaps another brand would be better."
5,"Great for Bottles, Nipples, Pump Attachments","These are awesome. They work so quickly and easily and I don't have to deal with pots and pans or worry if the will fit into a certain sterilizer. I used them for bottles, nipples, and pump attachments daily. Highly recommend!"
4,Very useful,"This is very useful. I use it every day. The instruction said that I can use upto 20 times, but the bag broke before then."
1,misleading,"Product name is Quick Clean but when you read the directions, you are required first to wash everything in warm soapy water before using the bag in the microwave. This is quick compared to boiling water but not what I thought the produvt was meant to do."
2,USE WITH CAUTION,"They rip easily after they have been heated, usually near the steam opening. They also melted my tubing and I followed as directed...i only have used it twice on my tubing at 6 weeks. First time because i thought clouding was bad, to find out the steam bags do and its normal. Second because some how milk got in the tubing. My hot water in my sink gets just as hot as the microwave so now i just soak them in hot water until i need them again instead."
5,Love these,"This is a very easy way to sanitize your baby's nipples, bottles, and breast pump accessories. Very easy to use."
4,Lasts a While,The bags last a while and steam my sons bottles well. The directions on the bag are clearly written. The spout to pour out the hot water is helpful. It would be better if the bags were a little wider. I usually add another two ounces of water and add a minute or two compared to the recommended use.
5,Love Em',I love these bags. You can use them 20x's per bag. Plus they make sure all your bottle and nipple are super steam cleaned.
2,Still have to wash,"I bought these under the impression that I could use them instead of washing my pump parts in the sink, but upon reading the instructions (when our hot water heater had gone out) the first step is to wash the parts in warm soapy water. Also, if you have a Medela pump that has a ""soft fit"" breast shield, you cannot use these bags for that shield, so you would still need to boil water or sanitize in the dishwasher, defeating the purpose of this product."
2,just ok,"U still have to wash them with soap and water, there s no reason to sterilize the stuff every time. I use these occasionally but not as much as I thought."
3,They're just OK,"We bought these specifically for the pump tubing. The directions say something along the lines of ""Fill with 2 cups of water, until tubes are completely submersed."" The problem is, the bags are so awkwardly shaped, it's hard to get the tubes to lay flat - it took almost double the amount of water to submerse them. So then what? Do we double the time in time in the microwave? We were left guessing on the time, and hoping it did the trick.Overall, these could be designed a lot better - or at least, something better could be designed specifically for the tubes."
5,Great invention,"This is the best invention for sterilizing baby feeding supplies. it saves more time than waiting for the water to boil. I just add a little water to the bag and the baby bottles etc, pop in the microwave according to manufacturer instructions and done. I would recommend this product for busy moms."
3,"Ok for traveling, but not for everyday use","I use the Avent microwave sterilizer everyday but got these bags to take on vacation with me. I guess I was used to being able to put several parts into the microwave at one time because I got so frustrated with these bags. I ended up just boiling some water, which I hate to do to sterilize bottles. The Avent sterilizer is just as quick in sterilizing and can fit so many more parts!! The bags seem kind of flimsy too. I like medela products, but not these bags."
4,Excellent sterilizing tool,"These Quick Clean bags can be used and reused. They are excellent for sterilizing breastmilk pumping supplies easily and on the go, like at work. Also, I live in a pretty small space and don't have the room for other products for sterilization. I love this! Do be careful with it though. The steam spout has sufficient warnings, but I did end up giving myself a first degree burn with the steam. Use pot holders when taking this out of the microwave!"
5,So great!,"I love these microwave bags! They are such a time saver and just make life a little easier when you have to clean pump parts or bottles.All you do it put your pump parts or bottle parts in the bag, add a few ounces of water, microwave for a few minutes, dump the water and everything is sterilized!Each bag can be used 20 times before you are supposed to get rid of it. While these bags are not a necessity, they are a nice convenience item to have around."
5,great for fast clean,this product is great for fast cleaning especially while i am at work! i just rinse the breast pump parts and place them in the bag with a couple ounces of water and microwave for 3 mins and thats it! great product!
5,Much better than the Dr. Browns,These sterilizing bags are a must for any parent having to clean baby bottles on the go or pump parts! I can put in three small Dr. Brown's bottles or two full size Dr. Brown's bottles at a time (plus some pacies). The closing snap part is very easy to use. I tried using the Dr. Brown's bags also but they don't hold as much and the closing snap part is difficult to close. If I had a choice of the two bags - hands down the Medela one is better. I also used it to clean my pump parts!
4,Often overlooked is the GREAT MUSIC,"Of course, I'm a John Wayne fan, so I probably can't be terribly objective about this movie. Obviously, there are serious holes in the story (a Confederate colonel will let his daughter ride off with a Cherokee????? Nahhhhhhh). What is often overlooked is the marvelous score by Hugo Montenegro. This is one of the great western soundtracks, just a step behind the all time greats (The Big Country and The Magnificent Seven). If you're into western soundtracks, you probably already have seen this movie, but if not, don't miss the marvelous work done with the trombone sections.The movie is entertaining, and with a great deal of humor. Actually, this is probably one of Rock Hudson's better roles ( I can't bear him in those fluffy Doris Day comedies) in that his comedic talents are allowed to shine without being ridiculous. Loved Roman Gabriel as a football player.....but as an actor...well, um, noooooo."
3,Avg but plesant western,"If you are looking for a rip roaring western of high quality, a film you will take with you to your grave, this isn't it.If you are looking for a pretty good John Wayne stock company film, with a few LA Rams (Olsen & Gabriel), some cool fight scenes, (4th of July party), a little history (the French Occupation of Mexico) and several interesting characters, McCartney and Mudlow and a small Richard Mulligan part, then this film will be a fine diversion for a day.I'm not sure it is worth buying, but it is worth watching."
3,Pretty standard western fare.,"A rather ho-hum western interspersed with some good action scenes and some fun chemistry between Rock and the Duke. But really nothing special. If you're a big fan of the Duke, which I am, then you'll probably enjoy it although it is not one of his better films.This is a Batjac film, the Duke's own production company, and he stocked the cast and crew with friends, the sons of friends, and even some LA Rams football stars. (Former quarterback Roman Gabriel plays Blue Boy.) If you're a fan of John Wayne films be prepared to see alot of familiar faces."
3,A solid Wayne Post 'War-between-the-states' Western. Ode to Roman Gabriel!,"Also, Merlin Olsen, another of GeorgeAllen, Sr.'s Rams NFL players. Wayne,who once starred at USC in footballas OT, liked Allen and the Rams. Butseriously, Hudson (the fag) and andOlsen's 'southern' accent ain't cut-ting it, thus the rather low ratingfor a John Wayne pic. At least it'snot the 'Train Robbers'!"
2,Thumbs down!,Disappointing team-up by John Wayne and Rock Hudson. Nothing much happens. You don't need this one!
3,Any Duke is Good Duke...,"I didn't really care for this movie the first time I saw it but as I watched it the second time I came to appreciate the great lines delivered by the Duke as only he can. Not my favorite but it does have a civil war battle intro, 3000 horse drive to mexico, the unavoidable mexican bandit trying to steal the horses, great outdoor scenery and the obligatory John Wayne signature group brawl.The VHS tape I have is the same cover as the one pictured and has a great making of documentary for the movie. Why is this feature not on the DVD?!?!"
3,Kind of a disappointment...,This movie kinda of leaves everyone hanging. I wish that it would have had 30 more minutes to tie up alot of loose ends. Also The Duke's Charactor kinda of get's portrayed as an opportunist. Other than that it's a good Duke film.
4,"What do you mean ""corrupt mexican general""?","the movie is a good one for anyone who likes John Wayne movies, for any non U.S. Citizen who knows anything about the history of the United States it has a certain melancholy pathos that has to do with the tragedy that was the War between the states, only i would like to disagree with the synopsis, both colonels go to Mexico to serve the interests of the French who were at the time trying to conquer Mexico, the so called ""corrupt mexican general"" was in the service of Juarez who was the rightful president, and the ""corrupt"" general just happens to fool both Gringo colonels into figthing the French and giving him the horses, I do not think the ""Duke"" would have accepted such a review since he was allways a friend of Mexico."
4,Why all the bad reviews,I almost gave this movie away because all the bad reviews. When I watch it I liked it. It doesn't have alot of killing but it holds it own. I got this movie at the thrift shop for .95. And I am glad I didn't give it away. Watch it for yourself than judge.
5,Great Rock Hudson And Jhn Wayne Film !,The Undefeated was a fun film to watch. Featuring history and action following the Civil War the Stars made it a good show. Both acted better than they usually did but this was the age of Stars when they were Stars.Highly reccommended for fans of Rock Hudson or John Wayne.
4,Art Book,"I bought this book for my wife on the recommendation from our artist son, Tim Ridley. She says that she likes the book and thanked Tim for recommending it. I have not looked at the book myself just yet, but will soon. I am working on some other projects, getting ready to teach another series of watercolor classes. I am studying Winslow Homer and John Singer Sargent to incorporate their styles into a painting process for students to understand using some of their paintings as examples and matching them to photographs that I our a friend of mine has taken recently. I already taught a series on J.M.W. Turner and his paintings and how to paint like him. I give my students the spirit of painting by showing them some of the history of great Master artists and then showing the different techniques and materials on how to achieve a similar type of painting."
5,The Art Spirit,"This book is recommended reading by my art teacher...I have only just started reading it, but it appears to be really interesting so far."
5,Very Inspirational,Robert Henri is such a great inspiration and this book let's you get to know the incredible character of an American icon in art. This is the kind of book that you read and ponder and reread many times. This is a must read for any artist or student. It represents so many artistic issues that we all confront continuously.
5,The title says it all,"Any artist who does not have this book in his or her library is being cheated out of great insights:""There are mighty few people who think what they think they think.""""Be willing to paint a picture that does not look like a picture.""""...pictures which do not represent intense interest cannot expect to create an intense interest.""""Effects of perspective are made or defeated by sizes of strokes or by their tonality.""And this is just the teaser."
3,Excellent yet SEXIST,"The content of this book is timeless, superior guidance for serious artists - well, MALE artists. I am aware of the time frame of this book, yet the incessant references to him, he, his, craftsman, man, man, man, he, he, he.... were so prevalent as to be distracting. Finally, I took a black ball point pen and censored every instance of male reference. I found it much easier to concentrate on the ideas and directives after doing that. I wonder whether all these 5-star reviews were written by men."
1,a pirates love,i would like to tell you but it didnt get my book an it dont look like im going to from my email
4,a pretty good book,it wasnt the worst nor was the best book i have read yey by JL. i think it fit in great with time then but the rape scene could be done without. i found interesting other then that.
5,Excellent read!,"I am so glad I didn't go by the reviews of this book and decided to buy it anyway. I loved it! The ""rape"" scenes were not what I thought they would be. Yes, it's rape because she didn't want to, but in the first scene, during the rape, she's actually thinking how good it starts to feel. Hmmm... If you've ever read Stormfire by Christine Monson, the heroine is raped, no pleasure there. Not so in this story. And it is understandable how she falls in love with him. Tristan is actually very funny, and he does grow to love her. You can see it, if you read the story.This just proves to me that it's best to read a book you're interested in, and judge for yourself. This is a keeper for me!"
5,Definite read.,"All these negative reviews, and feminist outbursts, just puts books like these on my ""TO READ"" list, thanks *ladies!* XD ROFL"
2,Degrading and Horribly Unrealistic,"I'm a lover of most Johanna Lindsey books but this book was terrible. There was no chemistry between the main characters (but how can chemistry occur when the first meeting involves rape). At no point in this book was love or even seduction developed. But, rape was mentioned over and over. This was so degrading and the main character Bettina by the end of the book has lost all her spunk. I love Lindsey's book because the female characters are strong and the strength is appreciated in the end by the man she loves. Not so in this book, Bettina's strength is broken and instead she's ""tamed."" Disgusting!!!! Now onto Tristan how about callous, arrogant, rude, spiteful and RAPIST. Perhaps this was the equivalent of ""Stockholm Syndrome"" in a romance book. I felt obliged to finish this book but immediately it was taken off my device."
1,Pirate's Love,"I found this book very disturbing. I was very surprised. The word rape appreared thoughout the book. The women in her life we acting as if it was no big deal. I always finish I book I've started. That was the only reason I kept reading. However, I enjoy Lindsey's books. This is the only bad one in all that I have read. I hope that my fellow readers will not stop reading her books. She has written some great ones."
1,I would give this 0 stars.,"I cannot even finish this book. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I am so glad I got it from the library and did not pay for it. I would throw it in the trash and I love books. How are you supposed to read a romance about a ""hero"" that is continually raping the heroine. Then everyone around her acts like it is no big deal and she should be happy about it because he is hansome. This book is discusting. I don't care if it gets better because I just can't take it anymore. It has been years since I didn't finish a book but I cannot read one more line of this book."
1,Romantic Rape?,"I enjoy romance novels. I do not enjoy reading about a woman who is abducted, continually raped, impregnated, and then FALLS IN LOVE with her rapist. I kept reading hoping that he would get his just dessert. But he didn't. She falls in love with him and he gets ""reformed."" ????? The whole time all I could think was--this is called Stockholm Syndrome! I was horrified that this was considered a romance. The rape scenes were graphic and, in many cases, violent.Johanna Lindsey should be ashamed of herself for making rape romantic. It is horrible. DO NOT READ!!!"
1,Her worst,"I have been a huge fan of Johanna Lindsay's novels for a long time, especially the Mallory novels. But this book offended me so much that I wonder if I will ever be able to view her the same way. The ""heroine"" was repeatedly raped by her captor - and it was not the typical sex where the woman has to be persuaded and then it is wonderful. This woman was repeatedly RAPED, screamed through it and had bruises on her wrists to show for it. Then for some reason which is not apparent to the reader, the ""heroine"" falls in love with her captor. If you are a Lindsay fan, SKIP THIS ONE!"
3,This book was exciting but the romance was dark.,"I think Johanna Lindsey writes very well especially in developing her characters, their relationships with each other and their dialog. However, I thought the romance between these two characters was a bit dark. The pirate (Tristan) continually raped her and up to the end he was not ready to marry the herione (Bettina) even though he realized he loved her. Also, how could he have left her again only weeks before she was about to have a baby? I like to have conflict between two characters because it makes it exciting but when there is too much conflict (as the case in this book), somehow the romance goes sour. I found myself intrigued by this book and I read it fully without being bored, but I really liked the other book I have read by Johanna Lindsey much better (Once a Princess)."
1,A Pirate's Rape,"The first ""love"" scene(heavy sarcasm) should have warned me to chuck this horrid book into the trash. If you are in the mood to be utterly disgusted then this is the perfect book for you."
4,Read the book,Anyone who reads Johanna Lindsey's books know that the character are ignorant to the last minute. This is no different with Bettina. She is captured by a pirate who desires her. She claims she does not desire him but the way she describes him and express her feelings gives the readers another idea. All of Johanna Lindsey's book protray the characters as saying one thing but thinking another. She does call it rape but it is not rape. No rape victim gets sweep in the moment. The dialogue is good and story is very suspenseful. The ending is very sweet and you feel for Bettina and Tristen. Read the book and see if it is so call rape because it looks like ignorance and sexual chemistry to me.
4,An Exciting Tale of Romance,"When I started reading Ms. Lindsey's books some time ago, I did not read this one because it had so many negative reviews. I figured that so many readers could not be wrong. When I had finished reading most of her books, I decided to read this one anyway. I found out that they WERE WRONG! Lesson learned: find out for yourself~ It is a love story of a beautiful girl who is captured by a pirate and ravished by him. It turns into a passionate love story set in the Carribean amidst tropical scenery. This is not one of my favorite Lindsey works, but Ms. Lindsey excels at writing even when she is not going full steam. It is worth reading and savoring for what it is, a fine escapist novel with an exciting tale of romance."
3,it wasnt the worst book,"i liked the book,enough to finish it. it wasnt the best of her works, but not the worst (so far). tristin did treat her badly, but i believe that is how it was back then, but toward the end they fall in love with each. the ending saved the book."
3,I had to find out for myself...,"After reading the reviews for this book I had to read it for myself. I have read almost every book Johanna Lindsay has written. I enjoy her work so I had to read this ""terrible"" book of her's to see for myself. Ok, so it's not one of her better ones. Almost everything in the other reviews is true. I like to judge things for myself. I do not reget giving it a ""read"". It was entertaining in a strange stort of way. Too much packed into one book for the story to really grip you. Far from reality but hey, it's fiction right? If readers want only true stories and reality they probably should not read fiction."
1,I don't find rapists lovable,"Normally, I love books by Johanna Lindsey... until I picked up this one...When Tristan actually rapes Bettina(you can't call it anything other than that) I stopped right there , horrified.I just couldn't finish the book. To me, a romantic hero is someone who SAVES a woman from rape.I don't know what the hell Ms. Lindsey was thinking."
1,I'm not too fond of cardboard characters.,I am absolutely dissapointed. The only reason why I finished the book is because I spent money to buy it. It took me almost 2 months to finish reading it because the characters in the story line was too lame.
1,Not Johanna Lindsey's Best,"This book was extremely offensive!!!! I am a HUGE fan of Johanna Lindsey and I have collected and re-read all of her books - EXCEPT THIS ONE! I can not bring myself to read it again. The only reason I keep it, is because it is part of my collection. Try another one of her books."
1,Completely unbelievable,"God this sucked... it sucked SO BAD.Tristan... you saw your mother brutally raped by a pack of pillagers, and yet you constantly rape your ""true love"" and taunt her about it. THIS MAKES NO SENSE. Bettina... you say you have control of your temper yet you're lashing out at everyone, not to mention you fall in love with YOUR RAPIST. It irks the inner feminist in me and these two have absolutely no reason to love each other. So glad I rented this."
1,Hated it!,"I love Johanna Lindsey, but I hated this book. If this had been the first of hers that I read, I wouldn't have read another. I was very uncomfortable with the continuous rape of the heroine by the supposed hero. This book should never have been re-issued. It needs to be forgotten as soon as possible!"
1,A torture reading it !,"I love Johanna Lindsey book, but this one was just horribly long and borring. There is a reason why this book has so many negative reviews... Do yourself a favor and don't buy it !"
1,A pity zero stars isn't an option.,"This book was terrible, shallow characters notwithstanding, the entire premise of a ROMANCE based primarily on REPEATED brutal rapes was completely unrealistic, not to mention offensive. I felt no affinity whatsoever for the characters, and their about-face from rapist and victim to a loving couple was entirely unbelievable. I am very pleased there was no sequel (possible plot: Tristan rapes his daughter, or something equally sordid). This must have been written by Johanna Lindsey's evil twin, as her other books are much better. I find that Lindsey's best books are part of a series, for example, the Viking/Briton series (Fires of Winter...), or, of course, the Malorys."
1,Horrible,"I can't believe I spent my money on such a trash! I usually enjoy pirate stories (McKinney ""Till dawn tames the night""), but this was stupid and the style of writting was simply unreadable. I hated Tristan from the beginning and although I hoped to start to like him, it wasn't possible and I thought I'd never finish the book. There's only one book as boring as ""Pirate's love"" and it is ""Temptress"" by Jude Deveraux. Don't read it."
5,a great novel,"This is one of the best novels i have read, and I have read a lot of novels. Some people object to the behaviour of the hero but we are speaking of a different era. she cannot talk about a pirate and make him sound like a modern soft man otherwise the novel is not sincere. the events are suitable for the time and the novel is witty and well written, the hero is intelligent and great. I love this one, I read it over and over again."
1,Rape is not romance,"This book is disturbing and, frankly, dangerous. It is based on the premise that women really like to be raped, that if a man just rapes a woman well enough, and often enough, she will be really turned on. That a virgin is forceably raped on threat to others and herself is not the basis of a romance. And when a women ""falls in love"" with her captor, we call it the Stockholm syndrome and talk about the extensive therapy she will need. Here Lindsey, whose writing I usually like, has the ""hero"" repeatedly rape the heroine who secretly is turned on by what he is doing to her and eventually she falls in love with him. This book is offensive. I do not know that I will ever buy one of her books again."
4,This author's other books are better!,"This book is not for those who are squeemish about kidnapping and rape as a basis for most of a ""romance"" story. I had a hard time reading this book but was ""compelled"" to finish it to see if it got any better. With the amount of kidnapping and raping by the ""hero"", I felt this must have been the author's one ""off"" book. All of the others I have read were much, much better and developed more of the character of the main ""lovers"". It does have a bit of romance between the pirate and his captive, and gets better toward the end, but I was very disappointed in this book; I doubt I would have bought more of her books if this had been the first one I read. Her other books are wonderful, very descriptive, sexy and extremely hard to put down; I own almost all of them. Don't let this book stop you from reading her other books as you won't know what you would be missing. I believe she is the best historical romance author I have ever read!"
3,A lot of Love Lost,"The story of Tristan and Bettina, was most Unfulfilling. He treated her badly and I could not find any reason for love between the two of them. I belive the story had enormous potential and could have been handled a lot better. However, the plot somewhat redeemed itself towards the end. I love the author, so don't let this put you off."
2,This Book Is An Astounding Insult To Women,"I cannot think of a less flattering, more misogynist view of awoman than what is portrayed in A Pirate's Love. I read it for thesake of being ""read up"" on the genre, and I am told that such instances of rape, violence, and general degradation do not occur in more recent romances. I'm very bothered that this book remains in print and available for purchase. Yes, it's THAT offensive!"
1,Most degrading book I've ever read,This book is so disgusting I don't know where to begin. My friend read it and told me about it so I read it for myself because I didn't believe anyone could write something so horrible. There is no way anyone who was raped would feel anything but revulsion for her rapist. This book was so revolting that my friends and I were convinced a man had written it until we found out that there were a lot more books by this author. I'll never read any of her other books because I'd never be able to forget she'd written this garbage.
1,Cringe-worthy,"My friends and I have a thing for pirates, so when one of us picked up this book at the library, she said, ""You all HAVE to read this,"" and it made the rounds. Not because it is good, or even just mindless entertainment, but because it is so ridiculous it defies description. We still laugh over how stupid it is, but I guess it isn't really funny that a 20th century woman writer could ever put that on paper. I do not believe that any sane woman could ever fall in love with a man who raped her. And in this book he doesn't just rape her, he forcibly, repeatedly, brutally rapes her. Come on! It was absolutely a revolting book. I almost have to recommend it because it's so bad. You might find it amusing."
1,Disgusting,"In modern society today, do we consider rape sexy or romantic? Of course not! Which is why I say don't read this book. Tristan kidnaps Bettina and gets her pregnant after continually raping her. The only part of this I enjoyed was when Casey showed up and realized Bettina was his daughter, therefore thwarting Tristan's plans to try and get Bettina to stay. Also, I loved it when Bettina planted doubts about her child also being Tristan's. But the rest of this book is disgusting. I don't understand how Bettina can love Tristan after all he's done to her! I would NOT recommend this book."
2,Not a pleasant story....,"Seduction is acceptable, but rape? No. Thank you kindly, but I'll pass. This is one of Lindsey's worse books, but it truely makes you appreciate her later works. She is an astounding author, but the period in which _Pirate's Love_ was written tends to be a bit on the masochistic side of sexuality. I've read other books from the time that my grandmother swears by that leave _Pirate's Love_ looking clean and wholesome. Not for everyone, but try it anyway -- from the library."
1,By far the worst of Lindsey.,"I know I read this book in it's entirety sometime, but when I tried to re-read it, it was awful! Lindsey's later work is a lot better and I hope even she would agree."
1,"Rape,Blackmail,This book has no Redemption","I was totally disgusted to pick up this book and read the awful RAPE scenes written by Ms.Lindsey. It made my stomach sick that she could justify putting this in a Romance. The Pirate(Tristan)-Kidnapped, Raped, Blackmailed, Lied his way thru the whole book. I couldn't believe the mother trying to talk the daughter into forgiving her Rapist and telling him that she loved him. It was the worst waste of money ever printed!!!!! Don't buy this book!!!!"
2,It was okay,This book was okay. The plot was interesting and I liked the little secondary romance with Bettina's mother. My biggest problem with the book was the relationship between Tristen and Bettina. The fact that he raped her wasn't that bad since many books written in the seventies and eighties had this theme in common. The trouble was there was never any reason for Bettina to fall in love with Tristen. He never changed. He never grew to respect her feelings. The two of them fell in love abruptly and unbelievably. All in all okay to read once. I do enjoy Johanna's other later books and I would recomend them.
3,A Pirate's Love,"""A Pirate's Love"" is definitely not Lindsey's best work but is worth reading. It is a romantic love story that will touch your heart! It takes a long time for Captain Tristan and this beautiful French young lady to listen to their hearts and finally find their own true love."
3,Dark romance,"i agree with the comment below about being a dark romance and then turning sour. This was one of the very first books I ever read by Lindsey, but I found the rest to be great. I didn't come away from this book feeling anything but irritation with Tristan and annoyance with Bettina. he treats her bad, but then loves him? And he still treats her bad until the end! And she still loves him! Make sure you are prepared for the rape scenes and violence, this book has plenty. I only gave this 3 stars because I love the author and am being nuetral, comparing her other work."
1,"I tried to like it, but just couldn't!","I really tried to like this book, but it just never got any better. Tristan who I guess is suppose to be the ""Hero"" constantly rapes Bettina. There was no seduction and at times very brutal. The only way Bettina could have possibly fall in love with him is from shear brainwashing by confindment and threats. Worst is her nursemaid from childhood and even her mother tell her to just make the most of it and couldn't she just try to love him because he's ""handsome""!!!!!!! Come on. This book should just be retired because it's way past time."
1,Did anyone really find this romantic??,"Please someone tell me what is so romantic about a man who repeatedly rapes a woman? I was so discusted by the way that poor woman was treated that I will never read another one of this author's books. And to top it all off, her mother and maid tell her to make the best of it. If my daughter were being raped, I would not stand by and tell her to make the best of it. Is this author smoking weed? No one in this book is loyal to their spouse, everyone is trying to rape someone, and in the end the wretched woman thinks she is in love with her rapist. I am sure a pschologist would have a field day with that one. Really, if this poor author thinks rape is so romantic, I ask her to please get to know someone who has been through it. Pure filth!!!"
3,Live from Golgotha,"I did not find this book of interest. In fact, I had to make myself continue reading it to the end."
1,APPALLING,"This book is a disgrace. My copy is going in the trash immediately. As a Christian, I don't want to keep at least this copy in the market. If it was possible to give zero stars I would do so."
3,And the Academy Award Goes To...,"I have always enjoyed Benilde Little's writing. I remeber when I first read Good Hair. I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to tell friends about this wonderful new author.And now two books later, I still feel the same way. Ms. Little is truly gifted. She has departed a bit from her original formula, but manages to deliver an engrossing story. At times, the story ambled and stumbled a bit, but it was very well crafted. The plot was an old one, but she went into a new direction and let us look at things at a different angle. The characters had depth, and made it easy for me to get to know them. Moreover, I wanted to know them. I'm looking forward to Ms. Little becoming quite a bright star in the literary world. If nothing else, this story drives home what all Sisters should know by now: You cannot lose yourself IN someone without losing yourself TO them. We can love our brothers strongly and not forget to continue loving ourselves. Wonderful book."
2,Check this out at your local library and save the money...,"I was very disappointed in this book and am very grateful that I checked it out at the library. The lead character is only a little bit interesting and the supporting characters are dull. In fact, the storyline is dull, predictable and I could not muster any support for the lead. I mean, by the fifth chapter, I was not interested in her plight anymore. Moreover, there are sequences in the book that come out of nowhere and some characters end up having a complete personality change by the end of the book (i.e., David)...I just did not get the sense that Ms. Little's heart was in this one."
2,I FORGOT I READ THIS BOOK,"I DID READ GOOD HAIR AND LIKE MANY OTHERS ENJOYED THE STORY. HOWEVER,I LOVE MY HUSBAND AND WOULD BE SAD IF HE LEFT, BUT LIKE INDIA AIRE SAYS I AM HAPPY JUST TO HAVE KNOWN HIM, SO NO TEARS, OR ALMOST GOING CRAZY OVER HIM. COME ON GET A GRIP. IT WAS AN OKAY READ."
3,Easy reading but. . .,"I loved Ms. Little's previous books but this one was not as exciting. Ina was a very interesting lady but she just did not grab my attention. I think there were just to many family issues going on and you just could not get to the center of the story. He cheated, he left and she had to go on without him. I liked the fact that it showed how black women are able to cope through various aspects of life. Granted this was an easy and nice read but it is not her best writing."
2,Not great,I have read Ms. Little's previous books and really looked forward to this one. I could not even get through it - it was abstract and not at all interesting.I rarely don't finish a book but I could not get through this piece of work.
2,Will do for a season,"Looks great in the photos. In reality the copper is very thin and was already bent upon arrival. The frame requires assembly and doesn't fit snug to hold the pit level. Pit screen is mishapen with paint chips. I do like the deep pit, but that is nearly all. I expect it to last a season before needing to be replaced."
4,roadmusic,"I want some music for on the road to sing along with.this album is one of them,several oldies and other songs."
1,Re-recordings,"Beware... these are re-recordings and lame ones at that. Some of Sheb Wooley's earlier recordings (""Purple People Eater"") can be found on a Bear Family single-CD release. ""That's My Pa"" can also be found on both single and box set CD's by Bear Family. His later stuff has yet to show up in its original (MGM) form.See my comment below this review for updated information about availability of these Sheb Wooley (Ben Colder) recordings."
5,Having read the Draft,"Having read the draft of this book, I would like to be the first to say--this book will having you jumping out of your seat, squirming, and flinching, but all the while, enjoying the ride! TL Gardner is the most vivid and exciting author I've read in a long time. His books have more than PROMISE...they have DELIVERY.The main character Elijah is followed through his crisis of faith and love for one woman, Ebonee, with such passion that you cry with him, cheer with him and despite your hesitation...FIGHT with him against the forces of darkness. Whew! What a read. Don't miss out on this one."
2,"Not bad, but not good","The characters were interesting enough to keep me reading and keep me interested in what was going to happen next. However, the flow of the story had too many abrubt scene/incident chages to make it a good novel. With more time, writing, and editing Demon Hunter would have been a good first novel."
4,A must if you have Sharkbite connectors,"I recently had a new backup sump pump installed with new connections to the water lines. They used teh Sharkbite fittings, great fittings but demanded that I get a new tool to use them. You may get it cheeper locally, try our ACE hardware first."
5,Great training tool,This batting tee is a great training tool I have three sons ranging from 7-17 and they all use it. Its a great tool to use in for my youngest to just get used to making contact with the ball and he doesn't have to worry about dealing with the tee just grab another ball and put it on the tee and swing away and my oldest likes it because it saves him time while he just taking cuts in the backyard he just sets up a bucket of balls hits one grabs one hits one grabs one ect. Excellent tool for everyone beginners to experts.
2,tim and eric awesome show season 5,"they finally came full circle and stopped being funny?jokes about jokes made in prior seasons, mostly the grossest and childish blends of humor they must have thought fans wanted. either that, or they really did run out of funny-juice. in an attempt to be more shocking than ever before, they've become a real bore on this season. too bad because i thought most seasons prior to this were insanely genius and that they were about to undermine everything that is television, hollywood, and DIY special effects.RIP balls insurance"
5,T&E make the greatest DVD art,One of the reasons i buy T&E is because the artwork is so amazing. Look forward to their future projects.
1,"The Worst Comedy Show Ever Keeps On A Rolling, Downhill","How to express how unfunny these guys are? It's impossible, they have a lot of ackward sketches that look like something that would turn out to be funny but the laughs never come. It's just odd, almost like stuff from Dumb and Dumber but without the payoff. How this stays on the air and how they get bigger actors on their show I'll never know. I wish I had their luck."
3,Sloppy?,"Is that her real name?I found some important information in this book about quilting with flannel. I did not care for the ""projects"" however. Book is overpriced for the content."
2,Virginia's Colonial Churches: Architectural Guide....,"NOT a helpful research book for my native Virginia! ALL type...at least needed some drawings and pics to illustrate, please!"
1,Boring -- even for a non-dancer,"I'm usually not one to write reviews, but I felt the need to share my opinion on this DVD since I have a whole library of workout videos. This one was painfully boring! There are two particular dance moves that you can default to if you get lost, and they are also used to link the separate dance sequences together. The problem is, you spend 2/3 of the workout doing only those two moves (which aren't very cardio-intensive anyway). You learn one new step, you go back to the defaults. You learn another step, you go back to the defaults. Then you link them together -- using defaults. I wish I could get my money back on this one. I was really disappointed. Try the Madonna Grimes dance videos if you want some more entertaining instruction."
3,Saint Etienne - Nothing Can Stop Us,"NOTHING CAN STOP US NOW, the second Saint Etienne single to hit the U.S., receives plenty of attention from the Masters at Work team, but the results seem a tad bland. The ""House Mix"" is the best amongst them, throwing in some nice chords to go with the kick drums and the vocals, but the other mixes vary little from that one. The ""12 Inch Remix,"" with its more prominent drums, doesn't differ enough from the original. So, still a great song, but with so-so mixes."
4,Good for Starters,"If you are beginning a business this is a nice book to read, if you have some experience already, this is not for you."
2,Possibilities that never went anywhere.,I managed to finish this book because I kept waiting for it to get better. Actually the last few chapters were certainly better than the first few. just boring..the huge issue here was matt's looming hanging for murder....and nothing was done to check that out til the end of the book. the poor little innocent almost nun thing was way overdone and tedious. There just wasn't anything to recommend it. I have read 4 or 5 other Robards books and haven't gotten above a 3* yet. Have to admit ms robards and I are going to have to part ways in the future. The odds are just against her..........
4,Well-Written Sensuality!,"The pages were steaming with the chemistry between Matt and Amanda Rose. I enjoy all of Karen Robards novels (both regency and modern). Amanda Rose resuces Matt, and then he kidnaps her to America. The plot of the story is somewhat weak...conflict arises from Matt's distrust of Amanda, who he believes betrayed him to the British authorities. Otherwise, the novel is well written with wonderful scenes of passion! Definitely a keeper!"
3,It could have been better,"I liked the book, with just three exceptions. I don't find forced sex, sexy & I could not see how Matt could believe for a minute Amanda betrayed him. After all the trouble she went to, to hide and save him and throughout the book it said she was a poor liar (blushing and so forth) and finally Amanda was always thinking how she wanted Matt no matter what and then she leaves him for England no less, where her half brother wants to get his hands on her again."
5,WHAT ABOUT BRIAN,"Great series, comical at times, showing how family, friends, reacting to a series of ups and downs in peoples lives. Great series for good entertainment."
5,An Exellent Overview of a Historic Mission,"In this book, the eminent historian Martin Caidin concentrates on one of the most brutal air battles in history-Schweinfurt. At a time when the B-17's flew with little or no fighter escort, and the German Luftwaffe had not yet been all but chased from the sky, the 8th Air Force launched a raid on the ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt, Germany. The result is a story that is at once tragic and heroic. This is a well-researched book, full of first-person accounts of the battle. It reads like a good thriller and leaves the reader with a new respect and appreciation for the brave men on both sides who fought their war five miles above the earth not so many years ago. Highly recommended reading for anyone interested in the air war."
3,Book on Black Thursday,Same as Schweinfurt - Disaster in the Sky - book a bit more worn than expected but no real physical damage. Reads fine but won't look as good on the shelf.
2,"Great sound, but the attachment hardware is anything but...","I bought this horn for my Mom's bike thinking it would be a nice replacement for her usual screaching screams to the neighborhood kids to ""get the 'bleep' out of the way"". The problem is that the hardware to attach the horn is not universal and therefore did not fit the new bike I bought her for Christmas. I attempted to retrofit but it obviously didn't work. I showed up at her house with the bike only to find that it had dropped off on the ride over and was nowhere to be found.Honk if you find it."
2,not as loud or as fun,"The sound is not as loud or as fun as I'd thought it would be from reading all the reviews. The attachment device is barely functional-it actually fell off my handlebars while riding the second day. For the price though it looks cool and the sound can be heard by the person who typically walks in the middle of the trail and can't hear my bell . . .. The shop was very fast and very responsive when I called about the sound. (They all sound that lame, it wasn't just mine.)"
4,loud horn,"bought this for a 5yr old girl's bike. if you looking for a fun loud horn, this is it. havent put it on bike yet so it might be a little big. however service was very fast, & arrive on time & in excellent shape. we do business with this copany again"
4,Unique,"The three different bells give it a Suess-like appearance and a unique, dissonant sound. It's a little louder than a single horn. Made of lightweight steel, the horn itself or the mounting bracket could get bent if you aren't careful. I bought it as a concert percussion accessory."
3,not so good,"This horn is, imo, of an inferior quality. The chrome chips off immediately. The body of the horn appears to have dents. Horn emits a rather high pitched noise. Overall i was dissatisfied with this product."
2,disappointed,the squeze ball falls off. I'm looking for some tape that I can secure it to the horn segment. I also had to find a better screw to attach it to the handle bar. The sound is perfect for my ride next to cars driving 50mph. It's simply poorly constructed.
5,Excellent Purchase,"They were sent to me in a timely manner. They are holding strong. You get what you pay for; they seem pretty durable they are hollow from the inside, wind will fly them in another direction, but all in all I am pretty satisfied with my purchase."
1,Item is NOT as described,"My wife ordered these for me along with several other holiday items. They finally arrived today and are NOT as described. The description says ""Approximately 7.5 L x 5 W"". What I got is only 5"" tall and more like 4"" diameter. They were even shipped in a box smaller than the claimed size of the product!I already had a set that size, and only ordered these because they were described as being significantly bigger than the ones I had. I have ABSOLUTELY NO USE for another set the same size as the ones I already had, and especially not when the shipping charge was twice the price of the item. I'VE BEEN RIPPED OFF, AND I WANT A FULL REFUND OF THE ITEM COST INCLUDING SHIPPING.===Update 1/5/2009I got an email today and the company reversed the charge for this item. But they still haven't corrected the misleading description."
2,Disappointing Remixes,"I like Book of Love's ""Candy Carol"" album, and I like many of the extended remixes of earlier BoL songs like ""Boy"" and ""You Make Me Feel So Good"", but I found the remixes on this CD to be uninspiring and repetitive. The track list isn't given in Amazon's information, so here it is:1) Counting the Rosaries (Partial Confession Mix) - 4:112) Counting the Rosaries (Full Confession Mix) - 7:583) Counting the Rosaries (Happiness & Love Mix) - 6:174) Sunny Day (Heal Your Positive Body Mix) - 6:045) Counting the Rosaries (Crying Angels Mix) - 5:036) Counting the Rosaries (Album Version) - 3:327) Sunny Day (Single Remix) - 3:48"
3,Not that good!,"I love some of Isabel Allende's books, like ""Paula"", others were really bad like the ones she wrote for kids.This book is not that good, I was about to drop it. The political part was to long and the story of Eva not very interesting."
5,her best novel and of the best books in spanish!,"El mejor libro de Isabel Allende, y uno de los mejores libros en espanol. Cuenta la historia de Eva Luna y Rolf Carle, en una manera bien inusual. La vas a disfrutar te lo aseguro."
5,IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THEN THIS,"i bought this cd after seeing john play at crazed in new york..after listening to the cd it made me realise that john isn't just good looking(he is drop dead beautiful)but he also is very very good dj.the cd is very well mixed and contains a great tracklisting with a lot of john's own tracks.if you are into the john digweed,sasha kinda sound you should defo go and buy this cd because it doesn't get any better than this...the ideal cd to forget the hectic city life at least for a while..total genius!!!!!!!!!!"
5,jar openers,Excellent set of rubber jar openers. The cup shaped opener has been especially useful. The openers are sturdy and seem well made. Overall an excellent value.
1,Price went up!,"I put this item (set of 3 jar openers)in my shopping cart, then continued with my shopping. It was in my cart for maybe 2 hours. When I was ready to check out I got a notice that the price had increased by almost a dollar! Doesn't sound like much but it's about a 20% increase. That is not OK with me so I won't be buying this item."
5,Handy kitchen tool just like I remember from childhood,We had some of these in the kitchen when I was a kid. Very useful. I never saw them anymore after a while so it was great to find these online and get a few. They really do help grip stubborn jar lids and I use them regularly.
5,good deal,"I love these, my husband and I have lost some of the strength in our hands, so it is hard for us to open some bottles and jars."
4,Great Substitute,Simple to store and use when you need just a little help and no one is there to help you.
3,Good selection of hymns,"I specifically was looking for this CD because it had the one particular hymn arrangement I was looking for. It is an a capella group, which is good and the arrangements are well done, not always the depth of sound I prefer."
4,Old school phone,"I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR A FEW WEEKS BUT I LOVE THE PHONE , THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANCE WOULD BE POLISHED CHROME INSTEAD OF BRUSHED CHROME"
5,Can you spell 'Polyrhythm'?,"One enduring dream of mine is to see these musicians live one day. The members of this group function as both performers and instructors/apprentices, so the cast is regularly changing. And listen to the sounds they produce! While percussion is strongest, the rhythms support beautiful melodic lines that thread throughout: voice, brass, flute. Dounounia and Faso Denou are trancelike, meditative; Ouradara Sidiki is call and response, not a bad selection on the entire album. I have all the music of theirs I can find, never tire of it. If the musicians are experiencing a fraction of the joy I feel listening to them, they must have the best job on earth! Just listen to Kara Mogo Mousso. You'll be sold as well!"
4,Looks like another new good author,"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Berry's first book, and look forward to more novels written by him...if he continues in this type of writing..Compares somewhat to DeVinci Code, not quite as detailed, or educational, due to too much romantic involvement between two main characters..and not enough descriptive writing regarding the now most interesting subjects, art and the Catholic artifacts."
2,Too predictable,"This book offers an intriguing start. But the story is quickly unraveled by the ""convenience of coincidence"" to tie characters and situations together to further develop the storyline. Too many coincidences and predictable events ultimately make the storyline appear like a collage of several other novels. The ending was a huge disappointment - a heartless killer suddenly becomes more obsessed with a woman's body than completing his mission; a divorced couple who seemingly have nothing in common except loneliness are suddenly madly in love (again); a man who has been ""protecting"" the Amber Room for decades decides to shoot a pursuer in the shoulder at close range rather than kill as planned. Many entertaining chapters, but the story quickly becomes a fairy-tale rather than an adventure novel."
4,Suspense!,"This was my summer read and I loved every second of it. It is one of those easy to read yet suspenseful, entertaining, action-packed novels. It will capture your attention from line one--I HAD to find out what was on the next page."
3,pretty good book,I knew very little about the Amber Room before reading this book and found the story interesting. It kind of dragged along but the history parts were interesting. As a 1st novel I think it was pretty good and looking forward to reading his next book about the Romanov's as I do know something about them For more back ground visit the authors web site. Has pictures and more back ground on the Amber Room and on the Romanov's. All in all not a bad book.
1,Too much Hollywood drama,"This book ended up making me mad. At first, the subject Berry chose to write about had seemed exciting and original. The first chapter was compelling, and it drew me into the book. I settled in for what I thought would be a can't-put-down mystery. However, by chapter three, this novel developed into a very bad version of ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" The characters reminded me of a hodge-podge of action movie personas. The plot was over dramatic. Besides the topic, this book lacked originality.I would have enjoyed this book more if the characters were original, the events described were more believable, and the overall tone of the book was much less Hollywood."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.This being Steve Berry's first novel, I think he did a fine job.A well researched story about the Amber Room along with an illuminating look at the world of treasure hunters and lost treasures makes for interesting reading. It also makes a good thriller.Don't expect a Dan Brown novel just because he wrote a positive blurb.Though not as riveting as some, this novel kept me entertained.I will read his next novel knowing it will be as good or better than the first.Recommended."
1,Redundant and Flat,"This is a book that I should have gotten through in 2 days. Yet after 2 weeks I still can't seem to care enough to finish. The subject of the Amber Room is interesting. But the writing and plot are predictable, repetitive and sophomoric at times. The characters are one-dimensional, and there are some odd mistakes that his editor should have caught. (Once inside the closed cave door, how *did* the character manage to redrape the outside chains as to make the entrance still appear locked from the outside? Was the rushing river hundreds of meters or hundreds of feet below the 3 story church veranda? Depends on which page you're on.)Yeah, petty, but I'd rather be scratching my head over am intriguing plot twist, but since there are none, I got bogged down in stuff like that."
1,"Not bad for first book, but Berry's a mysoginist","I too bought this book due to the endorsement from Dan Brown on the cover. I thought it unusual on some levels and interesting regarding the lost Amber Room. However, the writing is inconsistent in parts. And, Steve Berry obviously has a problem with women. His main character Rachel is an unlikeable bitch called the ""Ice Queen"" by her co-workers. As a judge, she pisses off both police and attorneys and has few supporters. She's treated her kind ex-husband (who is still holding a torch) like crap. She can't hold her tongue and makes one bitchy comment after another..and then says she doesn't know why she has to act like that. I think Berry enjoyed creating such a detestable character and no surprise when she was set up for a rape. Other female characters are also abused in other scenes. I found it disturbing and a little sick."
4,I liked it - kept me interested the whole reading,"My wife liked this book, it kept her interested the whole time. It reminded her a movie (like one of the reviews mentioned that it is like a movie script): a lot of action, fast moving, chapters end at the most interesting part then continue in a few chapters, a lot of fiction, exaduration, and history - she loves history! It was easy and plesant to read - for her :)"
2,"Good Subject, Less-than-Well Written","Excellent parts: the Amber Room mystery itself, travels in and around Russian (current & ex-territories), World War II stories.Other than the above, all other seemed unnecessary and boring. I actually picked up this novel cause Dan Brown put his remarks on it. If the Amber Room subject is to be written more adeptly, I think it has a chance to become blockbuster novel and movie, alike. Not the case with this version. Waste of time reading. Sorry, 2 stars only."
3,Just okay,"Just okay because -- I found the amount of repetitive explanation (flashback on stories, ""facts"" told by characters) to be annoying.I kept confusing who was who in the story. Maybe it's just me. Perhaps it was the abrupt changes from storyline to storyline. However, that did make it easy to put down for awhile before reading on. I prefer a book that I want to keep reading because it's exciting. The level of suspense was low and fairly predictable."
3,"Had promise, but sucked in to find NOTHING","The book started off well enough to keep my interest, but as the pages went on, it read like a cheap, goofy, berach novel. I was embarrased to read it in front of people for fear that I would be judged by this lame book. It kept my attention during the planeride back from vacation, but hardly addictive.The characters are really dumb and the sex parts totally unnecessary. One of the main villians was supposedly a professional theif/killer with staelth training, but all he could think about was raping the main character. Just out of character and plain dumb. I did not enjoy this book."
5,Powerful International Thriller,"This book has an intriguing story with engaging characters that kept me on edge until the end.Berry has researched this novel well and filled it with intrigue, sex, adventure, deception and murder.I highly recommend this book to your readers."
2,worst book I never read,Unreadable. Couldn't get past the first few pages.Even Danielle Steel can write better than this.How did this guy ever get published? No stars.Good cure for insomnia.
1,Berry Bad,"I am on page 80 and I am still waiting for IT to happen, The sex scenes are crude and amateurish. It's bad enough that we are assaulted with the F word in movies and reality TV, now it's in books that I trusted to be good entertainment. I want my money back."
2,Sooooooooo violent!!!,"I know this is a mystery thriller, but does the author have to make it so violent and bloody? I enjoyed the plot and the history that goes behind it but the vivid descriptions of the killings and rape just didn't sit well with me. It's actually pretty disturbing. I wouldn't recommend reading this book as a weekend reading."
4,Enjoyable,"As with any book there are parts you like and parts you don't. I thought this was slow to start and then a bit predictable before the end, but I did enjoy it"
3,the Amber Room review,"this is one of Berry's better stories, interest is quickly aroused and maintained, however it follows Berry's plot, an ill prepared protagonist, an almost superhuman antagonist and a well forecast outcome. But the plot is well developed and leads well up to its conclusion."
3,"Good historical fiction, but only a decent read","Historical fiction pieces are my favorite niche novel's and this one rates pretty well, but a full notch below the likes of Arturo Perez-Reverte, Iain Pears, and Anne Perry. The three mentioned above setting scenes and locations much better in opinion. Then again this was a debut novel, and I will probably check out another Berry book to read. I would like to add two things that I not seen mentioned in other reviews. First is that the chapters in this book are very short, which is great for someone like myself who has thirty minutes during lunch to get my reading in. The second is that I thought the way one key plot twist was revealed to Christian Knoll was very uninspired, but did not take away from a otherwise fast paced book. Writers notes at the end of the book were also very revealing."
5,A fast paced thriller,"Steve Berry delights his readers with this fast paced novel with exotic venues, intiguing history, and a suspenseful storyline. I had the pleasure of reading this book while crossing the country to California most recently and found this time to be one of the best parts of my trip. Kudos to Mr. Berry, the book moves with the same pace as the works of another attorney, John Grisham. Great Job Steve."
2,Kind of Tedious,"The plot is good, and I felt like the book ought to be exciting. But something about the way it's written just made the story boring. Perhaps it was the characters, most of whom are terrible caricatures. If you like the premise of this book, read something by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child instead - they know how to write a good treasure hunt novel."
1,"Fascinating Topic, but boring plot","The mystery surrounding the famed Amber Room is quite fascinating, but this book does not do it justice. While the author does provide much historical fact on the subject, his plot is lacking. For a much more enjoyable read with the Amber Room as the backdrop, try ""The Amber Room"" by T. Davis Bunn."
2,Script for a Made for TV Movie,"The characters actions, motivations, and planning skills are obscure or non-existent (or a sign of mental imbalance).2 stars for the history tidbits."
5,"Fast paced, authentic info.....",Just finished The Amber Room and enjoyed it very much. Liked the plot and thought it moved along at a good pace. Also enjoyed the authentic info that Berry included in his novel. Would highly recommend the book and I'm looking forward to his next one.
1,I was unlucky enough to be a European...,"...and to have (re-)visited the Harz region (""Exotic locations""?) on a bussines trip a few weeks before I read the book. I am probably naive, but I don't understand Dan Brown's (and others') recommendation - it has made me decide not to waste my time on his ""Da Vinci"" and other books..."
3,Mediocre thriller,"This Cross continental thriller pits two professional killers against one another as two prominent art collectors are in search of the Amber Room. It also manages to bring together a couple of divorcees.The characters are interestingenough, but the story is rather bland and lacks intrigue. Many questions surround what happened to the Amber Room, but I really struggled to find reasons to care about what the true answer is."
4,The Amber Room: A Novel,If you like mysteries set in foreign countries then you will enjoy thisfast-paced novel. I thought it a little drawn out but I did enjoy thesupense and twists and turns.
4,Great Read!,"This was a great book. I have read most of Steve Berry's other work and recommend this book right up with ""The Romanov Prophecy"". Very entertaining and fast paced. Some parts are a bit over dramatic or far fetched, but this is fiction! I loved it and so will you!"
3,All the ingredients...,"Not bad for a first time author - not a Childs or Douglas or Rollins but certainly headed that way. It had everything...history, truth, intrigue, believable characters and moved quickly enough that you wanted to finish and not put it down. I am on to his next novel --- you should read this one."
2,Too Mechanical,"I really wanted this book to work. It seemed to have all the right elements; history, Nazis, action, art and romance. Ultimately it was too mechanical. This was Berry's first novel and it was obviously very well-researched. Maybe his next attempt will be more finished. THE AMBER ROOM is like a painted room with no curtains. There's just something missing."
5,Hot Novel by the newest Clancy,"If this doesn't make the NYT best sellers listing, I'll eat my hat. If Steve Berry's first book is any indication, he'll rise to stellar heights in the industry. If you haven't bought your ""First Edition"" yet, get it before it's too late. Those who bought J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book know what I mean. The book is informative, believable, and well-researched. Apart from the fascinating history lessons, I found the protagonists to be characters that will grow on you. I can't wait for the next book."
3,drags alittle,"I enjoy Steve Berry and it is fun to see how much he has grown, as a writer, since this, his first book."
3,decent enough while between my normal authors,"stumbled across this book while waiting for my other books to get released. Good story, lags in some parts but the overall story was solid."
4,The Amber Room,This a typical Berry book that draws on a historical situation and builds from there. The book is easy reading and has a good amount of action scenes. Those who have read his Cotton Malone books will enjoy this as well.
2,No Thanks,"Fail. I couldn't buy it - like a lot of thrillers this novel was too contrived to like. For example - a main character, who is a judge, can clearly see that her father was murdered; but when she speaks to a homicide detective about it she agrees with him that it must have been accident. Why? She didn't want to have to tell him the unlikely, fantastic story that lead to his death. But then the reader of *The Amber Room* is supposed to buy into an ongoing fantastic, unlikely story. No thanks."
3,Not my favorite!,"Recommened by friends who know of my love for Brad Thor, Vince Flynn and Daniel Flynn. Don't love the lead characters, don't love the issues."
2,the amber room,very sloppy research and problems with the story further spoil a weak plot. skip this one and read his later books which are slightly improved.
2,Suspend All Disbelief,"I had high hopes for this novel, given the caliber of Mr. Berry's other novels. However, the number of illogical situations and conclusions were too high.1. What woman doesn't know the difference between her husband and a stranger when making love?2. How can it be expected that a suspected murderer will tell you they are responsible for a death just because you want to know?3. How many billionares will invite three strangers, who accuse murder, to spend the night?4. Why would parents assume that their children's uncle (who has no mention of special skills/employment/security system) could keep them safe from killers?Unfortunately, these are just a few of the many times the reader is requested to accept situations or conclusions that do not make sense. I give one star for the research of facts related to the Amber Room and one more for the basic plot with the sincere wish that more were appropriate."
3,Proving that logical and normal is boring.....,"Like myself, I think Berry tried to make his characters more human than super human. He generally had his characters make normal rational choices and perform normal human feats. The result?....humdrum. The amber room topic is great, a lot of potential. Berry's two main characters are like-able and you can identify with them....good. And...they're normal, not so good. I always thought that someone should write a book with more realistic characters. It's now been done. The result? You need a bit of the fantastic...or at least I do.You may want to try this anyway. Berry seems to be quite capable in the historical adventure genre. However, hopefully he's learned that novels need a touch of the fantastic."
1,If only Mr. Berry could write,"The Amber Room is my second and last visit to BerryLand. Life is simply too short to spend it reading badly written books. Mr. Berry is not a writer; if he were a chef, his skills would be strictly limited to microwave fare--fast, tasteless, and forgotten. I am not being too hard on the ""writer"" since he has no claim to that title. His books are not just formulaic, but lacking in imagination and momentum--I'm surprised he hasn't addressed sunken treasure in the Bermuda Triangle yet (if, by chance, he has, please forgive my oversight). Avoid this stuff if you value the hours of your life at all."
1,"seemed good, but.....................","The basis of this book was extrememly interesting since it dealt with the Amber Room.THe elements of mystery, suspense, a certain bit of spy genere made this book excellent till the end, which I found was a complete let down, since there was not the least bit of plausability in it. There is another book being written about the Amber Room, same title, coming out in the next 3 months.Wait for that one."
3,Decent First Effort,"Author Steve Berry has a lot of talent. His concept is good and the aura of the Amber Room itself is a compelling mystery. However his plot is filled with contrived characters and situations that hold few surprise and creat little momentum. Considering this is his first effort I would have thought his editor could have helped more with suggestions and cutting out the filler.Even so, I will look forward to his subsequent efforts."
3,"Dan Brown recommends, but it is NO Da Vinci Code!","I have to say I agree with the editorial review. I liked the idea of finding lost treasure, but by the end, I really didn't care anymore who did. The villains had interesting action (not only that, I found myself rooting for them), but I found their character development (Knoll especially) lacking. The plot depends on geography somewhat, and I wasn't able to get a grasp of it without pulling out a map. It is a decent debut for this new author, and I think I will check out any books he writes in the future, but having just finished reading The Da Vinci Code, and reading The Amber Room based on the recommendation of Dan Brown on the cover, I was dissappointed."
5,"Sorry, but the previous writer is an unsophisticated idiot!","What kind of a review is that? If you're going to critique something, at least put some substance into it. ""Mercury"" is chock full of excellent songwriting and anguished lyrics. The critics for some of the world's most prominent and respected music publications seem to understand the talent and craft of Mark Eitzel and his former mates. The fact the record buying public is not says that there are many more dopes out there like a guy who writes with the profound observations that ""this album is just another rock album and Eitzel is just another singer"". Yeah, like the Beatles were just another British Invasion group!"
2,"Sorry, not good enough...","Let me give you some advice: try not to spend money when your knowledge about the product you're buying is based solely on other ppl's opinions (so I guess I owe Roy Pearl an apologize...).Anyway, this album is just another rock album and Eitzel is just another singer.nothing special, really."
1,Don't say I didn't warn you,"This myth must be dispelled immediately. The accepted story is that AMC were a neglected treasure, fueled by Mark Eitzel's superior songwriting. Horsefeathers. This is tuneless, self-pitying drivel moaned by a bitter misanthrope and played with neither imagination nor technical chops. If you're a misunderstood, anti-social fifteen-year-old you might appreciate this, but only if you're also apathetic to the point of inactivity."
2,The Stooges' farewell film,"The Three Stooges go on vacation, touring the great outdoors. If there are big Stooge fans in your house, this very obscure film will be interesting as a curiosity, even if it does have a home-movie quality about it (the Stooges improvise throughout the picture). Non-fans will appreciate the gentler, relaxed approach to the comedy, and the scenic travelogue shots of lakes and national parks. Not a typical Stooge comedy by a long shot, but definitely of interest to fans."
2,Not Real Funny but a Fine Testimonial,"It's too bad that a first-class first-generation negative apparently does not exist - this videocassette does have the ""home movie"" quality many have pointed out. But for fans and historians there are a few nice things to return to. The ""boys finally 'on vacation'"" is a great idea but like many of their features, it lacks...punch. (Actually, the kindler, gentler approach works just as well). The ad-lib aspect is a plus, although it does not deliver much merriment. Like Laurel and Hardy's ""Atoll K"" the Three Stooges' final film features classic comedy actors overcoming impossible odds for the fans."
2,Kook' Tour is a sad farewell of the 3 Stooges.,"After 50 years in showbusiness the Stooges want to retire and quit the act. Larry, Moe and Curly Joe decide to go fishing at the most beautyfull places in the USA. Ironicly the Stooges first colored feature film is also their last one. It has nearly no good yokes in it, but a real Stooge-Collection is not completed without it!"
4,Added cyanocobalamin (synthetic B12),"The nutrition label on this isn't easy to decipher, but it has an added 100 mcg of B12 as cyanocobalamin (listed as just cobalamin) per 3 tablets.I emailed Solgar who confirmed this.This is a synthetic form of B12, which is odd since beef liver is supposed to deliver plenty of its own natural B vitamins.I'd prefer they did not add any synthetic vitamins to this product, as it is the most ubiquitous and easiest to obtain, and Solgar is a more trustworthy name I believe. But there you have it."
3,Recommended by Mary Enig,"Solgar is the only brand recommended by Mary Enig (Nourishing Traditions, Eat Fat Lose Fat). She stipulates that you do not want a brand that is processed with high heat, and some other criteria that I can't recall at the moment, but it's not like they put this information on the label. But I do know one thing for sure. They're big chalky pills, the kind that you feel like will get stuck in your throat and choke you. They're easy to chew, but really bad tasting. If you know a brand that comes in easy to swallow gel caps or something, please comment on my review to let me know."
4,Worked well,The price was excellent and the fit and quality are more then expected. I would definately say this is one of my best purchases
2,Difficult to swallow,"I never have trouble swallowing pillls, I usually swallow five at once but the shape and texture of these pills cause me to gag even when swallowing only one."
2,Why would you want a katana just to display it?,"First off, I'am adult.I first bought this katana when I started training with swords. The biggest problem that I have with this is that it is only a display weapon, and that you can not train with it. The Blade is very weak, and the handle is junk.All in all, don't buy this 'Katana' if you want to train with it.Only buy this if you want to display it.And by the way, all katana's have oil on them, they are made that way so that it is easier when you take them out of their scabbard."
2,Do not waste your money!,"The condition this sword was in when I receieved it in the mail was poor. The blade is bent at the handle, the blade is covered in some sort of greasy substance, and the blade is scuffed. The casing - i dunno what the real word is for that - has finger prints all over it and is scuffed, as well. I am very unimpressed with this product. The delivery was delayed, as well."
3,Good general overview,"This book would be great for any highschool students considering what/where to study for university or college. It provided more information about art in the United States more so than Canada.Overall, I thought the information the book provided was very brief towards what a career actually entails. It did go more in depth however, with real life examples of someone in the business, and provided good sources if you want to look into what schools offer such programs to lead to that specific career.I would consider the actual careers very general knowledge -- unfortunately it was nothing I didn't know before I had purchased this book. However, it may be helpful to someone who is clueless about the art world.In the end, it was an okay book; I dont regret the purchse."
1,Sketch Maps,"This ""atlas"" contains only black and white sketch maps, which give no indication of actual geographical and topological conditions. It has a fairly decent discussion of the history connected with each map, but this is necessarily short. This book should cost about 5 times less than it does, if it were about $7.00 it might be worth buying."
3,Chou chou doll,The doll is very cute.. although it is for christmas.. so i know nothing honestly of the durability at this time.. i was upset because it states online the baby comes with batteries an the doll i received did indeed come with batteries although they were dead! irritated me a bit... but im sure my daughter will enjoy the doll as i stated it is very cute.. only giggles though.
4,transported me 150 years into the past while I laughed,"Loved the book, understand why the author has such a big ego- He lived in an awsome time and was at the top. Historic details filled in alot of gaps to my understanding of the mid 1800's. learned many things about the lives of people living in the Steamboat Era and was grandly entertained. laughed outloud."
1,Does NOT work on Household Roaches!,"Pros: Unique non-insecticide scent (smells like bubble gum mixed with lemon grass)Cons: Scares bugs away but does not kill them, Wears off quicklyWe tried both the aerosol spray can and the pump spray bottle and while the smell is a lot better than other insecticides neither version is capable of killing common household roaches. If you spray it DIRECTLY ON THEM it will piss them off and make them scamper away, but they will be back in a couple of days once the scent wears off. We purchased 2 cans and also tried a bottle of the spray version - on the off chance that it might work better than the aerosol - but we are sorry we wasted out time and money."
5,Love Dr Brown Products,"I have been extremely happy with the Dr Browns products, this one included. It's made to use with the Dr. Browns bottles and fits fine. They also work with other standard bottles. No leaking. I moved my baby to this size at 9 months. He breastfeeds and takes a bottle at daycare. No issues going back and forth. I purchased the level two nipples after he started collapsing the level 1 nipples in an attempt to get the milk out and we have since moved on to Level 3. He's adjusted to the faster flow just fine. I was concerned he would prefer the bottle to breastfeeding with the faster flow but that hasn't been the case. Another great product!"
1,bad quality,"We ordered these nipples for my 6 month old baby. The nipples tore from the tip after first few uses. I have been using Dr. Brown bottles since the day my LO was born. I never had any complaints with the company or its products before this. This is scary! On the third day while feeding, my LO was having difficulty drinking out of the bottle because the flow was too heavy, that is when I realized that the opening on the tip had tore and milk was coming out of it much faster making her choke every time she suck on it!!"
1,Never received item because it was shipped by LASERSHIP,"Shipped through low cost carrier ""LASERSHIP"" which is notorious for losing packages.....like this one. Never received product."
3,No more 3 packs...,"First let me say that the actual nipples I would give 5 stars. Our baby has done really well with the Dr. Brown nipples, progressing through the various levels. I was also super happy when she started using the level 3 nipples as it really cut down the time to feed her a bottle. (Just don't advance to the next level too soon, or you might find yourself water-boarding your baby.)The reason I've taken some stars away is that I'm pretty sure that they have changed the packaging everywhere to only have two nipples in a pack. So I'm guessing that this 3 pack selling here is old inventory, which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't so much more expensive than you could get the 2 packs for,Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 3 Standard Nipple.In conclusion, highly recommend these, just not the three pack at its current price."
5,Great nipples,"I love that there are different levels to the nipples. It tells you about how old your child should be when using a particular nipple. I have to say that for my child, it has been pretty close to perfect. I love Dr. Brown products."
3,my review,"The instructions that came with this product were less than instructive. No more information on the website. I had to figure out a lot of things for myself. Product works well, once you figure everything out. Be aware that even purchased locally, the cartridge refills cost about 90 cents each and only make one liter of seltzer. Around here you can buy seltzer by the bottle for about half that."
5,Another great book from a fabulous writer,"I read this book years ago because this writer's books are too good to wait for paperback. In fact they are published in the UK about a year before their US publication so I usually buy from the ... branch. This novel is different - not Falco. But it is definitely a ""stay up all night and read"" book."
2,Interesting but lacks Davis's usual excitement.,"Junkies of anything related to ancient Rome will enjoy this. Unfortunately, Marcus Didius Falco this ain't. The only exciting part of the book comes at the very end when the main character's fate is, only temporarily, up in the air. Hopefully, Caenus and Vespian, the two protaganists, will be included in future Falco entries, all of which are far superior to this effort. I kept feeling like this story had been greatly edited, leaving out large chunks of time and action. Maybe if Caenus had babysat Falco this could have been more interesting. Nevertheless, Miss Davis remains a marvelous writer with a God-given talent for bringing the Classical Era to life. This book just needed more of her customary humor. I want Falco! I want Helena to have that damn baby! Amazon.com, please let us know when the next Falco novel is coming out!!!!!"
4,"Entertaining as a love story, educating as history tale.","This novel is about the career of the emperor Vespasianus, as witnessed by his mistress, Antonia Caenis. This freedwoman is the real focus of the book, and I think it is a good job, and it complements McCullough's ""Masters of Rome"" nicely although it cannot match her breadth and erudition. Davis is an Oxford scholar of English and has written several titles of mystery novels all set in ancient Rome, the protagonist being a Didius Falco. Those may be entertaining enough, but this one is a different category, and I'd recommend it above the others."
5,A strong and moving novel,"Lindsey Davis, whose mysteries I have enjoyed more than any others I have read, here demonstrates a remarkably sure hand at material which, if it shares a common historical setting with her mysteries, is nevertheless quite different in its emotional contours, time scale, and character dynamics. The light tone of her mysteries makes it especially rewarding -- albeit not surprising to those who know her work well -- to find here such a moving and mature account of love and separation. Also deserving special praise is the way in which Davis' characters believably age over the course of the book, remaining recognizably the same people while also reaching milestones in their life which allow no simple return to past ways."
4,"wonderful, intelligent story of Ancient Rome","I really liked this book. It tells a wonderful story of two people growing and developping, over beyond 40 years, (thank God not another of those books that end when people are young and beautiful - here, they grow up) without ever becoming unbearably long or dull, quite the contrary, it leaves you wanting to know more about that time and those characters, but still, it is somehow enough to know that much. My complaints: I lost the thread a bit when Caenis was living first in that slum appartement, then did not want to move back to Antonia's house, but still moved out of the slum. I either overlooked something or she was living somewhere (where?) for a few years; the other one: I never quite figured out what Caenis lived on: those occasional pieces of dictation and the (explicitly) unpaid lessons to the Imperial children - these inconsistencies make me rate the book only a 4, but extremely enjoyable still - if you like Ancient Rome, this is a treat!"
2,Not very intensive or comprehensive,"This was the first study guide I bought for my MCAT review. After reading through it I thought it was very good. However, after purchasing and reading the Kaplan comprehensive review study guide, I realized that the Columbia Review book is NOT very intensive and does not thoroughly explain some scientific concepts (especially in the biology section). Specific details include the muscular/skeletal system and the nervous system. Bresnick's book is like glossary of terms with simple definitions with inadequate scientific background. Save your money. Buy the Kaplan book."
1,Seriously?,"I don't understand how this book could get anything but a ""1 star"" from anyone. The questions are downright wrong! I've only done a few of the passages and found numerous mistakes where the book outright contradicts itself. You don't have to be a genius to find the mistakes, I found them in the verbal section. This book needs to be tossed - do yourself a favor and spend a little more money buying Kaplan/Princeton or basically anything else."
1,Makes a Good Doorstop,"This book was a dissappointment. I found the chemistry and biology sections to be lacking in their explinations of concepts vital to the MCAT. The testing sections were full of mistakes, something I found to be quite frustrating. How are you supposed to learn from an author who has trouble with the material? I would recommend Kaplan's Comprehensive Review, and sticking to the AAMC Practice Tests. Save yourself the frustration! Good luck on test day."
5,great set a must have for piano lovers,"Great set has many rare top 40 pop hits , terrific selection , great sound mastering on over 50 year old recordings .Winifed Atwell stands out as by far the best of the acts featured . many of these songs are only available on this neat Box Set and NO where Else .Grab It now while you can ."
3,Honky Tonk Piano,"The music collection was fine. Sound quality was fine. Three individuals and styles were presented. I did not care for the style of two. Since only one style was presented in the pre-purchase sound sample (which I enjoyed), this was not evident until post-purchase. With this exception, overall, the item was as I expected."
2,Doesn't fit,Belt doesn't fit. It is about 1/8th of an inch too short. I'm going to heat it up and hope it will stretch out enough to work.
1,Misleading illustration-improper content,"Especially for Catholic families, children or young adults, please do not purchase or read this book for it is a discription of sin, not a reflection on the beauty of our faith."
4,"CUTE, but not favorite",These little animals are just adorable and well-made. I just wish my little girl liked them as much as I do. I always get them out and try to get her to play with them but she just is not interested at all. Maybe when she gets older she will develop some interest in them. She is only 10 months right now.
5,"Scary, But Good!","This book is incredible. Very explicit and clear descriptions, full of details about the crimes. Well written too."
4,buy it now,"Absolutely brilliant. the sincopation and energy in it is rediculus, i liked his laid back version of Sonny Rollin's saint thomas."
5,Great Hydration system!,"This is a great value if your looking for a nice hydration system, and not looking to be put into the poor house. Quality is excellent, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one!"
3,Not so great,"Although the illustrations are easy for children to understand and relate to, the story is just not the greatest material for a supposedly humerous childrens' book. My daughter had a nightmare after I read her this book!"
1,Utter Rubbish,This book is useless for kids. I remember reading a version of the story as a kid. It was fantastic. This version is scary and badly written. The quality of the drawing were horrible. Overall i hate this version of the book. Its thrown into a corner.
4,Delivers on what's promised,"The movie serves up just what's promised: A sensuous treat for the eyes with enough story to fill it out. The acting is good, the scenery is gorgeous, and there are scenes you'll want to rewatch. The story is just passable, even a little unbelievable, so I dropped it one notch for that."
5,Super Sexy & Erotically Dramatic,"Billy Zane is so hot in this movie he just lights a fire with Joan Severance(sp?). It was one of the most erotic movies I've seen that was still R rated! I'm going to buy it, you should too!"
3,Severance and Zane are compeating in temperature a volcano,kostas novak Greece Although the plot is silly there is this scene in the bathhouse DRAGON where you can enjoy an unforgettable menage a' trois.
3,"not bad,but could be better","don't get me wrong i love joan severance but the movie would be nothing with out her, not bad acting, but bad script, to many left turns not enough, well you know."
2,Confusing Movie,"I generally like Billy Zane as the evil presence in a number of movies (Dead Calm was the first one I saw him in), but this movie was really quite confusing. The director seemed to be throwing in all kinds of different scenes that really had no bearing on the movie. I think they were being used as ""filler"". The acting was rather poor, except for Billy. I didn't even finish watching the movie as there didn't seem to be any saving grace to it at all. Rather a waste of my time and money."
3,Steam but no Fire,"Definitely some willing suspension of disbelief required with the plot. The characterization is odd, but works (mostly), though there are places in the middle where Severence's character does some things -out- of character.Some of the plot devices seemed extremely forced, but I will say that some of the sex scenes were incredibly hot and erotic.An excellent psychological tension was building among the characters, but ruined by how the script ended the bath house scene, and by some of the oddly chosen cut-aways during the scene. After the end of that scene, you dont really get the tension between the characters back, and the rest of the movie seems to be trying to explain away the previous actions of the characters.Not a bad flick, but the acting was much better than the script deserved."
4,Eroticism at Some of its Best,"I had watched Lake Consequence severals years ago and promised myself to purchase a copy when the priority allowed - I'm glad I did as it's one of the most erotic films I've seen - well-put-together with very good actors, interesting scene shoots, and the timing of the sexual tease was well-placed. I'd recommend this for both men and women."
4,"sumptuous, steamy, sultry, sensual","Being a sucker for Severance since her debut in the Gene Wilder/Richard Pryor ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"", every one of her films is a must-see for me, HOWEVER...This film is her finest. An adequate though undistinguished actress, this film has best exploited her innate sensuality and statuesque beauty. Combine her with the undeniably leonine Zane, and a few stunning supporting actors, and a bored housewife's daydream-fantasy-come-true plot, and you have a recipe for a steamy mouth watering cinematic broth which will NOT dissappoint.Prospective viewers MUST choose the unrated version, unless they find heightened sapphic sensuality offensive."
3,IT COMES BACK,"I BOUGHT THIS CD AT A STORE BECAUSE IT HAD IT""ll come back on it.E very store I went to did not have it. NOW IF I COULD ONLY FIND THE RCORD,TAPE OR CD OF HANK SNOW #104 I WILL BE EVEN HAPPIER !!!!!"
3,Red is gone but his music lives on.,"This essential set is the long awaited 'best of' anthology from the guitar-slinging prophet of the still-thriving American trucking subculture. Sovine's patented narrative-style vocal stylings bring to life such classics as the heart-wrenching tragic tale ""Teddy Bear"" and the other-worldly supernatural saga of ""Phantom 309."" Sovine's trademark dramatic readings run the gamut from the bar room brawl bloodbath of ""Colorado Kool-aid"" to the sordid, illicit romance of ""I Didn't Jump the Fence""."
5,Red Sovine- King of Trucker Country,"Red Sovine sang the great ol' truck drivin' and cryin' songs better than anyone else I know of. ""Teddy Bear"" still gets me; so does ""Little Rosa."""
5,Outstanding and very touching,This Man has touched my life in so many ways through words and as a child when my grandfather was still with us Red was all he listened to. I remember with daddys girl we would put in grandpas girls and the smile on my grandfathers face was priceless i take this with me when i visit his grave and sit adn listen sing and cry. I lost my last cassette i had adn am having a very hard time finding one but believe me as soon as i do I will have it again. Kasei(springsteen) Otis
5,A Real Feel Good CD,This one stands the test of time. The harmonic vocals on Key To You from the pop group Ambrosia lend a taste of familiarity and pastel contrast to this piano based masterpiece performed by the genius of Benoit...
5,Simply awesome,"I decided to write this review since I am listening again to this CD after many years of owning it. I remember I listened to the ""Sao Paulo"" track and was desperate enough to call the TV station to find out the name. They obviously refused to give it to me. Years passed and then I had the luck to hear the same music in a public event, went to the DJ and he handed the CD to me. Importing CDs at that time to my country was a major difficulty, so I asked for a friend to bring it to me by special catalog request. Until this day I remember this. Beautifully and digitally mastered, it will complete your ""smooth"" (I prefer contemporary) jazz collection with nice vocals and very ""singable"" tunes. (you will remember them). Tracks (some of them, like No Worries) feature Nathan East, and I can listen them 30 times over and over.In short: Go get it and remember my story when you listen to So Paulo. Enjoy it forever.Cheers."
4,I just can't stop loving his music,"Track 1 is the title track. I love most of all track 2, 5, 6. I expected more from track 3, with David Pack Lead Vocal. I appreciate the cover of I just can't stop loving you from MJ."
5,My reference standard for contemporary keyboard Jazz,"I couldn't resist adding another 5-star review. I rediscovered this album this week when I found myself plinking out (badly, very badly) some of the melodies on the little Yamaha keyboard my son received for his birthday. A brilliant recording of a brilliant pianist. ""Remembering What You Said"" is one of the most memorable and moving melodies I've ever heard."
3,Great deal ... if it works.,"I got this pedal to try to brighten up the tone of a fender blues junior. It sounded exactly how I hoped it would... until it stopped working after about 30 minutes of use.The pedal provided such a significant improvement that I can't bring myself to fire up the amp again until I get the replacement (which is being send via 2nd day air by Amazon free of charge).The real question is, do you want this pedal or the Boss GE7, which presumably provides more reliability for 3x the price. As this is just a hobby for me, I don't regret the cheaper option. Given Amazon's fair return policy, I'm bound to get one that works eventually."
4,Great EQ for the money.,"This is essential identical to the Boss GE-7, but in a smaller, plastic enclosure. It's not the sturdiest pedal, but it does sound quite good. It is very transparent sounding with very little noise. It has the same frequency bands as the Boss version and works like a champ. It has PCB mounted plastic jacks, so if you're rough on gear, don't expect it to hold up to the rigors of the road. Mine sits mounted in the middle of my pedalboard and stays on most all of the time for a mild mid scoop, so it doesn't see much abuse. For the money it's tough to beat these little Dano Mini effects. Not ""boutique"" quality, but good enough for rock n' roll."
4,Aye mate!,"I bought this EQ pedal after reading many good reviews, and it is my first EQ pedal. I'm glad I did: It really cleans up the sound, and in my case, if you're using a thick/fuzzy distortion (a la Silversun Pickups, My Bloody Valentine) and gives a nice boost for guitar solos. I wouldn't say the difference is gigantic, but it's definitely there."
2,Mine was Defective (non-working LED),The eq controls are very good and gave me the tone I was looking for. Also it was very quiet.It's just a shame the LED didn't work to indicate whether it was on or off when you step on the pedal. I had to return it for this reason.
2,right out of the box broken,Wasn't expecting much when I ordered this but I definitely got what I payed for. When I first plugged it in I immediately noticed that the 3rd and 4th switches were not working. I also got a lot of pops and hisses from this pedal. Ive since returned it and Im waiting on the replacement. I will write a proper review when I have a product that is actually working.
1,noisy,I dont know what you guys are talking about. This thing is noisy and it self oscillates at extreme settings. I would try and fix it but the contruction kind of prevents that possibility.Its not worth taking to a tech for a $30 pedal. Good for industrial sounds I guess.
2,Buzzy buz buzz,"This is a basic EQ pedal, that is a bit noisy in my testing. Even when running on battery power, there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs."
3,Does its job,For a cheap EQ it does great. Sometimes though when I hit the switch the light turns on and there is a second before the signal comes back. If it was not for that it would be a 5 star rating. I am not too worried about it because the pedal + loop pedal is still cheaper then the MXR or Boss Eq's
5,A must-read for prolifers & prochoicers,"It's enlightening to learn the gradual ensoulment of the fetus was Catholic dogma before the 17th cent, taught by Augustine & Thomas Aquinas.After that time the immediate infusion of the human soul was taught to occur at conception. A strong case can be made for a vegetative soul, then an animal soul, preceding to the human soul in the last trimester. ""the moral permissibility of abortion in the early stages of pregnancy is, AT THE VERY LEAST, an intellectually respectable view when the history of Catholic thought on abortion is considered in its relation to the history of science"" the philosopher authors conclude. While some of this is difficult to follow, it is well worth the effort."
1,"Guide to Owning an Akita Puppy Care, Grooming, Training, History, Health, Breed Standard (T.F.H. Dog Series, #RE-328)","This Book is only worth $4.95 Brand New per the publisher's price on the back, and it is being advertized as being worth hundreds of dollars brand new which is a falsehoods. Do not buy this book for its advertized price from any of the vendors listed."
1,Peter Rabbit's got it right.,"I bought this CD as a gift for a friend who is a big Percy Sledge fan, and we were really looking forward to listening to it. Unfortunately the sound is thin and flat, with none of the richness--in voice and emotion--we expect from this great performer. A big disappointment. Look for other Sledge CD's."
5,Percy Sledge: He Da' Man!,"Percy Sledge - So Misunderstood! No one that I have ever spoken to about Percy Sledge, can truly appreciate him, his work, and the heartbreaks he sings about. Not many of us ""PERCY FANS"" out there huh? I know, you think this has to be a joke... but it's not. Percy's songs will touch deeply into those places no one ever wants to reach, because it may hold pain, hurt, and memories better off forgotten. But sometimes, it's good to open up and get healed from the inside out, enabling us to love again. Percy's music does that for those who will dare to listen. Percy Sledge - Da' Man"
5,Unbelievable Find!,"A few years ago, I discovered Elvis Costello for the first time. Soon after, it was Snow Patrol and the Killers. This year's tremendous musical discovery is A Fine Frenzy. This album completely picks me up and whisks me away wherever I'm going or doing. From the thought-provoking lilt of ""Minnow & Trout"" to the punchy pull of ""You Picked Me"" and the passionate pining of ""Ashes & Wine,"" this album moves me from one emotion to another unlike anything has in years. I cannot WAIT until this fascinating songwriter and performer produces something new. And I didn't know a thing when I bought it. Take the risk. You'll be so thankful you did!"
5,"""Not allowed to wear your freedom down...""","One Cell in the Sea by A Fine Frenzy is one fine album. Alison Sudol is her real name and I love that red hair! Alison has a sweet, affectionate, and unique voice, in some of the tracks you can hear a hint of a English accent and this girl is from the West Coast! Her songs, melodies, and lyrics are worth purchasing this album. Everytime I hear One Cell in the Cell, I feel like I am in another decade or place, Alison also plays piano on six of the tracks. Songs I cannot get enough of are: Come On, Come Out, Whisper, You Picked Me, Lifesize, Last of Days, Ashes and Wine, Hope for the Hopeless, and Borrowed Time. The two songs released Almost Lover and Rangers are hands-down the best tracks on the album. Rangers is a haunting song that gets stuck in my head all freakin' day, love it! I highly recommend A Fine Frenzy, can't wait to hear what she does next! Enjoy."
5,I love her voice and her lyrics too!,"I clicked on A Fine Frenzy, never hearing of her before. When I started listening to the sound clips, I was hooked. She has a beautiful voice and I liked the lyrics, too. Loreena McKennett is one of my favorite Celtic singers, but I have everything she has ever done. It is nice to find another singer that reminds me of her voice and her style with a little Enya thrown in. A 5 star show to be sure. If you like Celtic music as much as I do, you will be hooked, too. Faira"
2,2 Good Songs,Don't waste your money on this one. It only has 2 good songs on it that I listen to. The rest all sound like eachother. She has an awesome voice but I was very disappointed in this CD. Thank you
2,disc unfriendly to mac computers,"This CD (disc, case, book) is in great shape and I love the album. However, the disc does not play or even function on MacBook laptops. I do not know why although I have heard of this before vaguely. I can play the disc on my dvd player but the sound is not as good. I will have to burn a usable CD of this album from my roomates computer. I didn't want to return it because it wasn't expensive and I like the music. However, I will not buy from this seller again. I did not see anything on their description about not being able to use the CD on Macs. Their products are not very useful to me.Thank you."
2,One Fine Song Only,"This artist is okay. She has one good song, but because the price is so good on amazon, it was okay to buy the CD. I don't think she's that great; the only good song is Almost Lover."
5,An Original work of art!,"I love the whimsical and thoughtful lyrics, combined with beautiful melodies! This CD is now one of my treasures. Suzanne"
5,A Fine Frenzy Also A Fine Listen,This young lady has a great voice that is new and fresh sounding. This album has become one of my favorites..And the song writting is onboard to. Nothing plain here. It's catchy and soothing at the same time. She will become a timeless artistic treasure.
5,very nice record and very nice sound,This is a very nice record and the vocal is very great who express every song inthis album with excellent emotion. Highly recommend!
4,beautiful!,"This CD is wonderful, especially Almost lover. I feel like it gives me power when I run because you are overcoming sadness. I recommend this cd most definitly"
2,good bye my almost lover,"I don't like this CD :) but it came in great shape and on time! I bought it because i love the song ""goodbye my almost lover"". I wish the rest of the songs were just as good!"
4,Lovely,"Although I wish her lyrics were a bit more positive, I can fault her musical appeal and lovely voice."
1,Great band! All Music is too expensive.,"Great band! All Music is too expensive. I could buy a discount album for $5 and get a few hours of listening, or get a $5 bundle of games for 100s of hours of enjoyment... and each one includes a soundtrack! [...]"
3,A 3 star album,"...got a bit suprise at first, but fall's in to bore in the few last songs!Alison Sudol's did make some good songs in the first few track, maybe a little bit more effort on her next record."
2,Disappointment,"I read some of the other reviews and I'm happy that some people were able to get something out of this album but somehow, I never could. I listened and listened to the songs thinking, ""This has got to be for me because she's recommended based on other female singer-songwriters that I love."" However, instead of loving this album, I was bored and frankly, a little irritated by the boredom that insued from listening. Lyrics were dull, music was all the same and I would say to people looking for a good female singer-songwriter try: Brandi Carlile, Regina Spektor, Tori Amos' older stuff, Missy Higgins, and/or the first My Brightest Diamond album. But don't bother with this one, you can do so much better!I really wanted to like this but I really didn't."
3,A Fine Frenzy Review,"I watched a video on Youtube with the song 'Near to You' by A Fine Frenzy playing in the background and fell in love with the song. I went to their myspace page to listen to more of their songs and then decided i wanted to buy the album. However it wasn't available in New Zealand so my second choice was to turn to Amazon, which supplied me with this CD efficiently. Amazon service is very good so i will defiently be using Amazon again."
5,One Cell In The Sea - Great Album,"One Cell In the Seais probably my favorite album released in the last two years. For a guy who buys hundreds of CDs a year and listens to every genre under the sun, that's saying something. Every track on the album is incredible. This is probably the best debut album sinceThird Eye Blind's debut masterpiece.Even though I loved the album from the start, some of the songs didn't hit me at first. I was not a big fan of ""You Picked Me,"" because starting your song off with ""One, Two, Three"" just isn't the way to win me over. Still, this song has grown on me too. I can forgive the counting off.Alison's voice is amazing, and unlike a lot of the pseudo piano player musicians of today she can actually play. But most importantly, this is just well written music in every way, lyrics and accompaniment. If you haven't checked this out yet, you owe it to yourself. I can't wait for the next album.I hope you give this album a try.Enjoy!"
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"Absolutely, hauntingly, beautiful. Alison somehow finds a way to merge thought-provoking, totally relatable lyrics with melodies that are out of this world. There's a number of more melancholic songs on the album, but they're balanced out nicely with a few sweeping, spirit-lifting offerings like ""You Picked Me"", ""Come On, Come Out"", ""Rangers"", and so on. A song for every mood. In conclusion, this is a stunning, hypnotic record, and completely worth the price (and it's quite a bargain on here)."
5,I need more A Fine Frenzy!!!,"I got A Fine Frenzy's newer album first and immediate fell in love with her voice. It all happened so fast I had to get One Cell in the Sea directly. Greats songs, lyrics and now my new favorite voice to hear. This album was a great deal! A little slower than Bomb in a Birdcage but still many moving songs."
4,A beautiful release...,"This is another discovery I made on my own like KT Tunstall-I've had some luck so far. This album is so good, the songs seem to have the potential to be boring but they're not at all. I think its A Fine Frenzy's style and lead singer, I'm not sure what but it makes for a really good album."
2,Disappointing,"I had heard people gushing about this album, so I decided to get it. I wish I hadn't. While Alison Sudol does have a very lovely voice, it is lost in the editing and back-up vocals. My main issue, though, is that all the songs sound the same; I have a difficult time telling them apart. And it's sad, because I really want to like this album. But I just can't."
4,Hauntingly beautiful voices,"For all of you that are moved by hauntingly beautiful voices such as Alison Sudol's, check out Over the Rhine."
3,A Few Gems Make It Worth The Listen,"I'm going back and upgrading my rating after three weeks based on having had a little more time to sit with the album. I have enjoyed the recent flood of talented female artists sharing their unique voices from Amy Winehouse to Sara Bareilles to Colbie Calliat. I agree with one of the recent reviewers that this album suffers badly from overproduction and perhaps doesn't compliment the talent of the amazing vocal talents of Alison Sudol. At times it still seems as if she's struggling against the background tracks to hear herself in the recording studio making it hard to really get into it. However, on a few tracks especially ""Lifesize"" and ""Ashes and Wine"" her sultry and slightly bruised vocal style really comes through. This is still a welcome addition to the genre. Hopefully the next attempt will really let her obvious talent come through."
4,I liked it,"I like this album so much, but it's not my favourite. Sometimes I've got the feeling that some songs resemble the others so much is kind of annoying. Even so, This album is really good in my opinions: you should let it grow on you. And the sound is so... delicate that sounds perfect every time you're feeling blue. I reccomend it!"
4,mags,i had never heard of this group and bought it on the recommendations from amazon!! its a really good album!!
2,Wrong Cat? But Cute.,"This movie is cute, but I wasn't entirely satisfied as it isn't the movie I thought I was getting. Instead of black and white, this movie is in color. The movie is filled with quirky one-liners and good old-fashioned shoddy acting, so it is still worth the money for anyone fond of older movies, or something kids would love.Also, clocking in at almost two hours, it's a little too long."
4,MAD ABOUT CATS,"This is a fairly old Disney movie which I remember seeing the first time it came around. It is entertaining and kids should appreciate it. Be warned! I live in South Africa and this is the first time I have had problems with a Zone 1 movie from Amazon. I also bought 'The Three Lives of Thomasina' and 'Bell, Book and Candle' - same vintage - as I said, mad about cats!"
3,The Cat From Outer Space,It's an old but wonderful Disney moive. My girls love it because of the cat just as I loved it as a child.
4,Another Disney Classic!,"Zunar J5 Zoric 9/49 (aka; Jake) has emergency-landed his spaceship on Earth, and in order to make his deadline, he must acquire 6 cubits of a common, yellow, substance(SPOILER WARNING aka; $120,000.00 worth of Gold.) So he be-friends Frank, Liz, & Link(aka; Ken Berry, Sally Duncan, & Mclean Stevenson) and hurries to keep ahead of a General(Harry Morgan, another military leader) and the US Army, and an Industry Leader, intent on using the cat for Power and Financial Gain. Jake and Company must get Jake to the Mothership before it leaves Earth for 1,005 years. In short, this is another Walt Disney Classic."
4,One of my favorite flicks - then and now,"The Cat From Outer Space... this was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid that came from the very early 80s. Talking felines, flying bug-like spaceships, a very 'lite sci fi' plot that you can sink your teeth into... I think the Disney Channel (back when it wasn't just low budget pre-teen fare) showed this movie atleast two or three times a month and I probably watched it each time. After nearly a decade later or more, I saw it again for the first time about two years ago and was delighted, it was still a fun flick to take in over some popcorn. Just ignore some of the cheesy effects and you'll make it through fine. A 'gateway' sci fi film that serves as the portal to getting into 'harder sci fi' with bigger spaceships, planetary attacks on earth, giant buglike space aliens and all that good stuff."
1,Subtitles?,"Where is closed captions or English subtitles? :-(When I was young, I loved to watch it but I don't understand a story as I am deaf. It would be great to have subtitles."
4,Cat from Outer Space,"When I first saw it I loved it because of the cat speaking and having special powers from the necklace. Even though its old it's worth seeing because you wonder, if cats could talk what would they say. If you deciding on wether or not to see it, then you should just go watch it."
5,Dreamy pacific vibes,"I stumbled upon this by accident. If you had suggested before, I listen to 22 tracks of any music from the Hawaiian Isles I'd have thanked you kindly and backed away. How wrong could I have been?! This CD is just the finest, dreamiest CD I have listened to in an age. The melodious tones just waft over you like a welcome breeze on a hot summer's night. Pop this magical disc in your CD player, press the repeat button, turn down the lights grab a long drink and you have the cheapest travel you could ever take. You will be magically transported to the Pacific Isles and back without leaving your hammock (or your living room). One thing that was also quite revelationary was the insight I gained into the Hawaiin peoples. Having listened to this CD a couple of hunded times I can maybe appreciate their zen-like approach to life. Let's hope this leads to a deeper understanding of an truly fascinating culture of which this is but one part - and no Elvis in sight!"
4,Meygan is so cute! :),"Meygan is by far the cutest Bratz Baby. They should make other Bratz Babyz with long pigtails like Meygan's. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because i have 3 Bratz Babyz (Sasha, Roxxi and Phoebe) and they do get boring after a while. So, just a heads up to all you parents- eventually your child will probably get sick of their Bratz Baby. So if you have a child who wants something, gets it, gets sick of it, and asks for something else (and then the cycle starts over again and again and again) then the smartest move would probably be to not buy it. But if you have a child who wants something, gets it, and is happy with it I think you should definitely buy this. Now, I'm not saying this is a boring, stupid toy that shouldn't have been made. I just wanted to give a little warning. So, anyway, I think Meygan is so adorable and if you are a Bratz collector you should definitely add her on to your collection."
1,Not What You Think,"Don't let the 1980s photo of John Wayne fool you, this early, early movie house serial is not the John Wayne feature film you might expect. This OLDie is a keystone cop type, poor quality, poorly acted, poorly edited joke. You don't laugh at jokes, you laugh at the movie itself. It might have been entertaining in the 1930's but not now. There's no flow to the story, delivery is far from smooth and storyline errors abound."
2,"""Hurricane Express""","Service on order was great. I am a ""train buff"", and I remember this seriel as a kid at Saturday Matinees. What a shame the DVD releasing company used such terrible source materials - a 16MM print instead of the 35MM original. Interesting to see production techinques from that early sound era, but the bad print quality I can not forgive when going to a medium as high quality as DVD. Gladly swap it out for a better print source DVD. I worked my way through University as a Theatre Projectionist, and went on to work in the motion picture industry. I have high standards! Any feed back from other purchasers/movie/train buffs?Antony Alan Botto"
2,"OK Serial, miserable video quality","This review pertains to the Alpha Video DVD, which clearly the previous review does not. The image quality of this DVD is about the worst I have ever seen and I therefore urge you NOT to buy this edition. The original print element is bad, and the video transfer looks worse than a VHS tape recorded on the slowest speed. I don't know how other editions compare, but I doubt they can be any worse. The serial is nothing special, although I might have enjoyed it more with a better quality DVD."
2,"John Wayne , The Early Years",First off the title is misleading as it don't explain that there are three movies not the Early Years in this disc package. The only one of the three movies that are any good is Hurricane Express. The other two have Satanic setting & both my wife & I feel uneasy watching them. We love John Wayne but these two movies are not for Christians to watch.
2,Good old fashioned cliff hanger series,"This is an early cliff hanger series that we used to see in movie matinees with a new segment every week. The series includes sequences with a Ford trimotor airliner and some good railroad sequences. On the tape version I have seen the video quality is only fair and often poor. However,it is fun and worthwhile."
3,Planes & Trains,"This is a serial starring John Wayne as an airplane pilot. His airline is competing against his fathers railroad! It is action packed and holds the interest well. The video and sound are both very good. I hate watching old movies with bad sound, this is not one of those.The Ford Trimotor airplane and the close up views of the train engines are amazing. My wife and I both enjoyed this movie.Mike Bunkermeister Creekbunkermeister dot blogspot dot com"
3,The Hurricane Express,"A great early movie with good acting for John Wayne. However, the plot just rolls over into the next with seemingly no end so that you can tell it was made from a weekly serial. I am certain is was entertaining for kids at that time and die hard John Wayne fans but the only thing good about this film is John Wayne himself. I would watch it just to see him in an early film but if he were not in it I would not bother at all."
3,It takes a village...,"Among all the facinating characters of the small town, Mr. Foote must be the town gossip (but not a malicious one). Seems like Mr. Foote knew EVERYONE... and I don't think he left anybody out, either. Fun to read, good storytelling style, but it seemed more like a series of great characters sketches than a ""real"" memoir. At the end I was frustrated that I didn't find out more about how he got started as an actor/playwrite/etc. But that's nothing a sequel won't solve."
4,dream catcher,This was a very interesting book because it had the ability to keep you focused on the objective at hand and still transform you from one setting to another in a very fluid manner. The way everything ties together is masterful. Be sure to read the two previous books before this one so you will be able to enjoy this work as it should be enjoyed.
3,needs a good edit but satisfactory ending.,"I love this author, and loved the first two in the Series. I cannot figure out why Mr. Johnston put so much from the Chinese characters perspective in the story. I ended up scanning over those sections and was glad I did- it really didn't go anywhere at the end.this was by far the most graphic of the series, almost too much description- but I get squeamish easily.the anti Mormon sentiment is strong too."
5,Fantastic Cookware,"This pot was a little larger than I originally thought, but it has turned out to be the most versatile pan I have. It is very heavy duty steel (I was afraid it would be flimsey, well-constructed, commercial quality. I can use it as a large skillet, and turn around and use it to make stock. It has that perfect in-between depth that allows it to be used for liquieds, and then also used to sauté."
