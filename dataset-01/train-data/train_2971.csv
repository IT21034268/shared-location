4,Pretty good but a tad bit expensive!,"I find it pretty strange that no-one has bought or reviewed this camera. Well as the sole purchaser of the camera, I thought that it was pretty decent buy, though maybe it might be too expensive. This camera has all the basics, excluding a zoom function.It takes standard film,has auto-focus, auto advance and rewind,A self-timerDate printingRed-eye reductionThe larger and easier to use viewfinderand a neat little dial which gives the option of manually choosing to turn the flash on or letting that process be automatic.Overall, I'm pretty happy with this buy, though I have to admit, if it had a zoom function, I would have been extremely pleased, but as I'm no photo expert, this camera works for me!"
3,Not a very usefull book,"I do use this book. SOME spells are pretty neat-o but that is it... most of the spells in it can only be used by wild mages and even the priest spells are weak. My DM uses this book all the time, but only for reference to spells, the magical items stink... you think that they could put some items from the Expensive encyclopedia magica, into other books... Although I do like the name... Tome of Magic..."
3,Good for a start but not enough,"The book did have some new spells and interesting items, although the Wild Mage class is lame, the elementalist idea is pretty cool. However, the spells and magical items are either too restrictive, worthless, or downright silly. There are a couple of good spells and items, but not enough. TSR probably held them back so they could force you to buy some other lore book."
3,Planescape,"Good campaign setting with lots of detailed description. A little dark for my tastes, but has some very interesting new character races."
2,Lydon Performance Saves Film,"The plot of this movie is truly intriguing; the acting by Harvey Keitel is fine; but if it weren't for John Lydon as Leo Smith, this pitiful mish-mosh of a so-called thriller would be unwatchable.The lighting is so dark that it is hard to follow the action. The sound quality is terrible, and the plot twists and turns are so oddly paced that the tension is dissipated before the final scene. The one bright spot is Lydon's fresh and crisp portrayal of the rich psychopathic copkiller. Lydon is a natural actor, and does a great job injecting the right mix of youth and innocence with the aura of sick and dangerous obsessions. If you're a Lydon/Rotten fan, don't miss this; otherwise, forget it."
2,TV version,This is the censored version with all the cursing and graphic violence taken out. It may be the only available version which may make it worth something. It does not specify that it is the TV version anywhere so it is a bit of a deception. Pretty good movie if you are curious.
5,Epic Hardcore West Coast Hiphop!!!,Now What?Is one of the dopest CDs to come out in the last 15 years. It's not just the realness that makes this CD infectious but the production is off the hinges. Ain't Nothin' Like The Town was a cult classic when the video debuted on The Box Music Network 1999 - 2000. It was more popular than the Cash Money Millionaires. Now the CD has become a certified classic. You won't be disappointed with this one. Every track is a hitter!
2,"Switch to ""ATi 9800 Pro Series"" ASAP !!","I replaced my previous MSI 5600 FX with this card cuzI thought ""PNY 5900 128 MB"" gonna give my games some ""Magic""but I just seen a little improvement and of course this not enough for a Crazy Gamer like me !!I suggest to choose one of ""ATi Radeon 9800 Pro"" Seriescuz current nVidia FX Series not as good as ATi.Finally, I gonna switch to ATi Products and my choice this time is ""ATi 9800 Pro 128 MB"" cuz this card like M*O*N*S*T*O*R moreover, its price so fair !!Trust me dude !!I'll not let you down :)"
2,there is no analog support through the live drive,"The thing works well EXCEPT the reason i bought it was that it has analog support through the live drive. It says that there is, but there isn't. I want to be able to use full duplex mode and record while playing back at the same time. However this doesn't fully work with multitrack recording programs. In both Cakewalk and Cubasis, when recording a second audio track, the first audio track is mixed in with the second, which analog wouldn't do. I called up creative labs and they told me that this product doesn't have analog through the live drive like how it advertises. If you want to do multitrack recording, don't expect to use the live drive."
5,"I dig it BUT, get the 5.1","This is the mother of all sound cards. Package is intense. The games are nice and the software packeage is great, Sound fourge is a rocking wav editor. The Live drive just makes it all the better, BUT if you're thinking about it, get the 5.1 it has the digital outputs. And also has a remote control, which is great for DVD playback. As the 5.1 because more readily available this version will get cheaper, and if you do not need digital outputs and it is a no-brainer. All in all I'm very satisfied with this product, creative is also very great about driversIMO this is the best sound card that money can buy."
3,Alright Card,"This is a nice sound card. I installed it with my Windows ME when i first got it b4 the audigy came out. It was the nicest sound card you can get. After awhile i got XP, then it went downhill. The drives are XP incompatible and the newer drivers sometimes dont install over the XP native drivers. Tried contacting Creative, but that didnt help, took forever for a responce"
5,Need I Say more?,"If you're looking for the best sound card around, this is the one.It's the best, of the best, of the best, sir!Enough said.The only improvement you could make is to get it with the LiveDrive II (Sold Seperately)."
1,disappointed,have never been able to get the dispensers to work correctly. Now i have this ugly white box on my shower wall that's only good for holding a bar of soap & razors.
5,My 5th one,I love these things... Moving to a new home and bought a new one so it will be there when we move in.
3,Soap Dispenser Deluxe IV,"Three Things:1. Easy to install.2. Broke the mirror the very first thing trying to put it together. Then found out that it would cost half as much as the whole dispenser to replace.3. Wished I had realized that to fill the containers EVERYTHING needs to be removed to refill. The ""door"" swings up to get to the containers so everything on the shelf, the soap dish and the razors need to be taken down. Not a good engineering idea."
2,okay,"this is a very nice, product. however, i would recommend purchasing different silicone glue. i received mine today, held it in place for 5 minutes, thought it was holding well. just to walk out of the bathroom and BANG. it fell and the mirror already broke :("
2,Piece of crap,"I only give this 2 stars because I love being able to use the mirror in my shower. Otherwise I would have given it no stars. The dispensers do not work at all. Filled them up with shampoo and conditioner, but when I pressed the button nothing came out. I left the button pressed for about a minute to see if maybe I needed to give it some time, but all I got was a tiny, itty bitty flow going. If you have the patience to stay there ten minutes then go right ahead and buy it."
4,No clutter,Easy to refill. Looks clean in the shower. My next purchase will be the same brand but without the mirror. Not getting much use of it.
3,Doesn't work with some shampoos,"I bought this to help tidy up our bathroom, since we now have 4 people total in our house. I use Pantene Pro-V shampoo and conditioner, and Oil of Olay body wash. I followed all directions and I felt like the dispensers just weren't dispensing well with the products I use. I would stick to more gel-based products that aren't quite as thick. It might dispense better. Other than that, the product is great and my boyfriend liked the idea of having a mirror to shave in the shower. I returned it with a full refund provided. We now just use one of those corner shelving units in the shower that works quite well to keep stuff off the shower ledge."
5,Ulti-mate is really the ultimate,"I have used a lot of different shampoo and liquid soap dispensers and each one has given me a different set of problems, most common one being their highly unreliable pumping mechanisms that tend to break down within 1 to 3 months proving the item useless.This dispenser has not only been designed very cleverly, it has a reliable pump and I mean it because I waited about 8 months before writing this review.I am so satisfied with the unit that I came back and bought 2 more pieces afterwards as gifts to my friends.Anyone who'd care about a well organized shower will be extremely happy about this one.A huge ""thank you"" to designers/manufacturers of this unit who obviously take their job very seriously."
5,Awesome,"Easy to set up. Just make sure to absolutely wait a whole day after you apply the silicone. It's extremely important. The only thing is that it couldn't dispense a very creaming expensive conditioner. So I had to dilute it with water to work. Which I didn't like doing..otherwise, this was perfect. But the mirror still fogged. Lol.."
3,A decent historical look at UU,"I'll keep this review short and sweet, because there's not much to say, really. /The Unitarians and Universalists/ offers a comprehensive look at the history of Unitarianism and Universalism, and their mixing in recent times. However, the book is rather dry and offers very little ""food for thought."" It's mostly names, dates, and movements. The writing is uninspired and not very compelling.As a guide to the history of UU, this book is acceptable. I've encountered far more interesting books and essays on the subject, however. The level of detail is high, but you will definitely not find yourself reading this book for anything beyond obscure details of the past."
4,One you can miss out on if you don't need International accounting,It explains how does accounting apply to international economics and its full spread over managerial part of accounting that differs in every country and is not laid down as set rules everywhere. Good book.
3,THE MAIN EVENT,"Energetic musical stage play chronicling the life of circus showman, P.T. Barnum, (Michael Crawford, who is quite adept at circus performance.) The big-top atmosphere is magnificant but the musical is bogged down heavily by an insistent plotline detailing Barnum's marital domestic trifle which adds little drama and only a bit of spice. It would seem Barnum's questionable and god-like exploitation of circus freaks lies at the heart of this superficial, action packed production, which is highlighted by genuine stunts and acrobatics. Filmed before a live audience in London, the extravagant cast call is well worth waiting for."
5,If you're a fan of Michael Crawford you'll like this video!,Any Michael Crawford fan will appreciate this video! It is a recording of a live performance (taped the same year Phantom opened) of the play in London. I felt like I was sitting in the theatre! MC's performance is excellent & the whole cast is strong. You'll be glad you bought it.
4,Great Show,I got this for my niece for her 16th BirthdayShe loved it!It came in time for her party and we all watch it togethershe is big into musical theater.
5,The ultimate Barnum!,"Michael Crawford is super. Watching this show it's hard to imagine doing this over 1400 times. I have seen the American movie version and there is absolutely no comparison! This is a must have for anyone who enjoys circus movies, musicals or both!"
5,Barnum,I loved the musical Barnum. I have children and it was a production that appealed to all members of my family. Michael Crawford is a wonderful performer and he is supported by a strong cast. Well done!
4,A-HA Minor Earth Major Sky CD Review,"This CD is a decent reflection of A-HA's talents, though I would have liked to hear it before buying it. I based my purchase decesion on glowing reviews and was hoping for a little more from the get go, though it does grow on you. No big hits like ""Take on Me"", and the main reason I bought this CD was for the song ""I wish I cared"" which is fantastic, and album would get 5 stars if they all followed it's strength."
4,"Great Album, Deserves More Air Play in North America!","My wife is a huge a-ha fan and after listening to this album, I think I have become one as well. Minor Earth Major Sky, Summer Moved On, The Sun Never Shone That Day, and Thought That It Was You are all songs that stand out. Their best since East of The Sun West Of The Moon."
3,Still Growing On Me,"I rate this album 3 stars only because it's one that hasn't struck me with the same unique and catchy seduction the way that A-Ha's first album ""Hunting High & Low"" did. I didn't even know A-Ha was still recording new music, and learned of this particular release after hearing ""I Wish I Cared"" on Smallville. I was smitten immediately, and had to find the source. The title cut is good, as well as ""Little Black Heart"", and of course, ""I Wish I Cared"" is my favorite on the album. This album isn't the pop sound of A-Ha's first release, but I think it shows growth and versatility."
5,I'm going to enjoy playing this CD in my car all summer long,"I've been a fan of a-ha since hunting high and low and have gotten every one of their albums since. I feel like one of the fortunate privileged few in the US that have experienced their changes and growth in musicmaking over these years, and this latest album is no exception. This album feels like a natural progression from their previous works. It's not synchy like their first few albums, but not as experimental as their later ones. It feels like they have matured and feels more confident in what they can bring to the table. What results is a great mellow album full of deep, catchy, atmospheric songs. All the things that I have come to expect from an a-ha album."
5,"Minor wait, major album....","Minor Earth/Major Sky has all of the intensity and moodiness of ""Memorial Beach"" and ""East of the Sun, West of the Moon"" but with a cohesiveness that the previous albums didn't quite achieve.... Paul and Magne still remain two of the strongest -- and most undervalued -- songwriters of our generation, with deceptively simple lyrics imbedded in complex and moving musical arrangements, and Morten, of course, is an undeniably gifted singer.And as I inevitably do with every a-ha album, I've found one particular track to listen to obsessively; ""The Sun Never Shone That Day"" has been on ""repeat"" on my CD player for two days straight.... That song alone was worth the price of an import album."
3,Better days,"Perhaps I was expecting too much, the last album 'memorial beach' was a highlight, and after that, they split up. They came together for this one, and it's not reaching the level they had once. I'm disappointed. The mixing of Morten's voice is bad done, the mastering is okay, they used a few samplers everyone is using, just to sound 'modern'. But I miss the pithiness they were known for their earlier songs..."
1,I wish I cared (about this CD)!,"I can not understand any of the other reviews. I have listened to a-ha since ""Take On Me"" and while their last two albums have been dismal, they each had a gem or two like ""Waiting For Her"" or ""Dark is the Night for All."" Expecting at least one or two standout tracks, I paid for the import of Minor Earth. It is so bad, I had to warn others! This CD is just bland, unmoving, boring despite its excellent production values. I have forced myself to listen to it several times waiting for it to grow on me, and it doesn't! A real dissapointment to a long time fan."
1,Disappointing,"I like a-ha, but after listening to this album, I'm not surprised they're not around in the States. Not as good as everyone hear claims. Morten's voice is off key, at certain points. There are few, if any hooks on the entire album. I bought this album based on these reviews. I learned my lesson. I'll download a couple of tunes next time before I commit."
2,Disapointing Cd,"I Truely love 80's music. I listen to my brothers and sisters old 80's albums. One of them was A-ha's ""Hunting High and Low"" I loved that album a lot it songs were upbeat with lots of catchy tunes. When i found out A-ha was going to make another album i was pretty excited. I found a pre-owned album of minor earth major sky for .... I listened to it, it sounded barely like A-ha its songs are not that synth pop-ish there is some weird songs that make no sense at all. Only one song is good. The first track is good everything else is boring. This cd totally dispointing. I hope they make a better cd.(I'm only 11)"
5,Finest European Pop Rock Gem,"A-ha did it again. They are known by 1986 #1 hit Take On Me. After hearning this album, I need to reappreciate this Norwegian superhero which can be comapared to Abba. This is not the repeat of Hunting High And Low but they get better than that.This album is like finest European/UK pop rock legends such as Depeche Mode, Human League, Duran Duran, Level 42, and Dream Academy combined. Summer Moved On is melancholic, moody but well made first single and Minor Earth Major Sky will give indelible impact on your mind. Velvet the third single is another fine song. But these singles are only the gateway to this enormous masterpiece. You haven't yet listened to I Wish I Cared which will be sure to get them recognized and can exempt them from being called one-hit wonder. I Won't Forget Her is another commercial track which is Depeche Mode/Level 42 styled mainstream European pop rock. If you are a fan of European mainstream pop rock you can never miss this."
2,"Following a sharp downhill after ""Scoundrel Days"" . . .","I'm trying to be as kind as possible here. Yes, Harket has an amazing voice. Yes, their first two albums were fantastic and the third was so-so. But after their messy 90s albums, things would never be the same as a-ha limped into Adult-lite-rock territory.This is a shame, because obviously there's talent being wasted. If Savoy's last album was any indication, this new a-ha album could have been great. But, like all of their previous albums (with the possible exception of the beautiful ""Scoundrel Days) the band had to bow down to the demands of record companies and music trends. How else would you explain the decade old beats, the limp remake of ""Velvet,"" the metalic production that makes the album sound more 1990 than 2000?Sigh.Minor Album, Major Dissapointment"
5,THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR ALL PL/SQL PROGRAMMERS,"THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR ALL PL/SQL PROGRAMMERS. THE EXPLANATIONS ARE VERY BRIEF AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND, AND THE EXAMPLES ARE VERY CLEAR TO GRASP THE MEANING OF..WITH THIS BOOK, I GET TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN PL/SQL WHICH I THOUGHT WAS HARD TO MASTER. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.."
5,Dred Scott Case,"Very good analysis on salvery in USA.Recomend to anyone interested to understand the pre and post Civil War mind setting of politicians in that era,as well as our actual political game."
4,dred scott review,"The book arrived on schedule. I have to disagreewith the description of it's condition. The seller said itwas in ""Like New"" condition which to me means barely distinguishablefrom a never been purchased book sitting on a shelf at a bookstore that sells new books.This book did not have that appearance. The pages have mild yellowingand the dust jacket shows signs of worn edges. It's not a big deal since Ihave decided to keep it but the term ""Like New"" seems inaccurate."
5,"""...I lied when I said that honesty was dead""","This album was my introduction to NoMeansNo and my record collection hasn't been the same since.Having never heard a full album by them, and completely blown away by their live show, I borrowed this CD from a friend. I was not disappointed. With energy that belies the age of the players, ""Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy?"" features some of the heaviest, smartest punk available.The brothers Wright are among punk rock's best (and most prolific) storytellers and lyricists, as evidenced in tracks such as ""The River"" and ""Cats, Sex and Nazis."" They are also masters of their respective instuments, expressing their ideas in perfect tandem with the vocal ""melodies.""Also contained on this album is the hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor typical of NoMeansNo: ""Chairman Mao was a great cook...he fed all of China"" from ""Kill Everyone Now.""Get in on the joke, get this album."
4,Great Albulm,"No means no was a great band. So heavy and raw. There music like jazz, it has so many weird breaks."
5,private presley,"This is a very nice book about Elvis's army years, a lot of nice pictures from his army days in Germany, a nice collection addition to my Elvis book collections. Thanks to the great people of amazon."
4,The Last Sin Eater,"Thanks to this story by Francine Rivers, I learned something new. I did not know that different societies around the world used a person called a `sin eater` to `eat' the sins of a person after they died to help them transition into the afterlife. That is what this story ""The Last Sin Eater"" is all about.It also tells the story about two young children named Cadi and Fagan, how they come to know the saving grace of Jesus Christ, and how the practice of using a sin eater is nothing more than a stumbling block to knowing that Jesus is the only one who can take away our sins.The story is set against the backdrop of the Appalachian mountain range, with the characters being from Scotland and Wales, which makes for some interesting dialogue but all the more realistic to the story itself.Not only do you have God versus Satan, you also have jealosy, betrayal, and long kept family secrets that finally come to light in this delightful and uplifting story."
2,Not a favorite,"I read most of this book, but found it boring and repetitive and not up to Francine's usual stellar writing. I skipped quite a bit of the middle of it because it just didn't capture my interest."
2,"Good, but...","Overall I would say that this is a well written book, but there were some parts that bothered me. I thought the author gave a good feeling for the place and time of the story and the theology behind the story was sound. But, the charaters were a little too underdeveloped, I never became emotionally involved in their struggles. The main thing that bothered me though, was the fact that the main character, a young uneducated girl, is quoting word for word from the Bible, the King James Version no less, after being told the gospel . Kind of implausable."
5,"Moving, Charming, Bittersweet,","This is a charming, touching, bittersweet, yet ultimately triumphant, book about intriguing archaic beliefs from past centuries: the idea that one person in a community be designated to ""take on"" the sins of the village, damning his soul to hell.Beautifully written, I was captured from the first paragraph and my interest was sustained throughout the book. I found the book's redemptive ending very satisfying."
5,Francine's Best,"I've read many of Francine's books. The Last Sin Eater is my favorite. Francine did a remarkable job of creating this story in a way that all readers can connect. It's believable. I loved the characters! They will stay with me for many years. She did a great job of illustrating mankinds confused perceptions about God and His grace. And she illustrated His gift of salvation--a gift we simply need to accept to own. Thanks for another great work, Francine."
5,The Last Sin Eater,"Another amazing read from Francine Rivers, who never disappoints the reader. Her research and knowledge of this era is superb."
4,The Last Sin Eater,I thought this book was very good. I live in the South and know that the mountains are like living in the darkness because of lack of education. I thought it was well written and held my interest. The only problem I had with it was that the main characters were a little young for what they were going through.
5,Wonderful,"This was a wonderful book that I would suggest to anyone, and in particular to those who have ever felt the weight of guilt on their shoulders."
3,Really 2.5 stars!,"The Last Sin Eater disappointed me possibly because I loved the other two books I've read by Rivers so much. The book's plot kept me interested, but did not thrill me. I liked Cadi's character, but found it unbelievable that the people had no hesitations in their new found Christian belief. The immediate and complete change in the characters after they found Christ was just not believable at all! I would not recommend this book!"
1,a born again Harlequin novel,"I had hoped that this would be an interesting story about redemption, with local folklore thrown in. I was disappointed.The most interesting character in the story (Cadi's grandmother)dies in the first few pages and it's downhill from there.Cadi is an interesting child but her fixation on finding the sin eater is never adequately explained. Neither is the often bizarre behaviour of the supporting characters. Their ability to quote Scripture is admirable, but doesn't leaven the flat plot.If you enjoy Harlequin novels (there's nothing wrong with that, many people do) you will enjoy this book. If you want something with a little more substance, move on."
4,The Last Sin Eater: A Review,"I just finished reading this novel. I started last night at 10pm and put it down early this afternoon. This novel is a wonderful story about the awesome power that is Jesus, and how amazing it is to be saved through Him. The main character is Cadi, a young girl who has not yet met salvation through Jesus. This story is about her journey to Christ and His plan for her.I do not agree with other reviews on how it is unrealistic for a young girl to quote scripture from a bible that she has never even read. The purely fictional acconut of Cadi bears truth in that when we pray for the words and the courage to witness to others,the Lord gives us the strength and the words so that people can understand. This novel tells a about a girl who finds that through God all things are possible, and that Salvation can not be granted by any ""sin eater"" but by Jesus Christ.It is a warm story, mysterious, emotional and spiritual."
5,Loved it,A beautiful book. I love Francine Rivers. She captures my attention to the end. Would recomend it to anyone. Good.
2,"dirty book, warped and diry","The book arrived dirty and pages warped as if it had been wet.Have not read book itself yet, but hate to even hold it."
4,Profoundly Powerful,"This was the first Francine Rivers novel that I have read and I loved it! While I agree with some of the other reviews that parts of it were unrealistic (like a 10 year old quoting word for word Scripture from the Bible that she has never read), I think it was still a very effective story.I was thrilled with the suspense in the story and the surprise twists along the way. I was deeply touched by Cadi's longing to have her sin removed and her determination to find the Sin Eater. The imaginary friend Lilybet was a nice touch, though I didn't figure out she was imaginary for a few pages!Just a marvelous piece of work with a message that will stand the test of time: Jesus Christ is the only way to God and the only one who has the power to remove sins.Profound."
4,prompt service,I haven't read the book yet but the service was prompt and that is surely appreciated.
5,Fantastic,"I really enjoyed this book. Set in the mountains in the 1800's the book tells the tale of Cadi, a sinner, who finds the truth of atonement and her conversion. The back country dialect was charming and the author's usuage of morals and bible passages helped the story flow smoothly without feeling ""preached at"". A must read for anyone seeking to repent his or her sins."
2,Am I missing something?,"I am a born again Christian who loves the Lord very much. However, this book is very syrupy. I do believe in complete transformation of a believer, but the portrayal of the charachters after the Spirit took hold was a bit much. The sudden quoting of scripture and the complete change in behavior is not what we see in new believers today. To portray a new believer in such a way, is to deceive seekers into thinking that as soon as you turn your life over to Christ, you will be a walking Bible, able to answer any question about the Lord that someone may ask you and that life will be great. I did not care for this book at all."
2,Not her best work,"I consider myself to be a pretty big fan of Francine Rivers, but this novel left me wanting. The plot moves painfully slowly with very little explanation of customs or character. It really was just painful for me to read, though I had to finish just to see if it got better...it didn't. There are a few minor characters who make it more interesting, but generally, I would say don't waste your time on this one."
4,The Last Sin Eater,"Wow! This story gripped me. What a concept! I learned so much from this book. Francine Rivers has once again made me feel as though I knew the main character personally. I related to her so much. I could feel her emotions and was brought to tears at the same times throughout the story, that she was. I recommend this story to anyone who needs to capture the reality of God's grace, forgiveness and redeeming love. You'll need to take a big deep breath at the end of the story and close your eyes and thank God for bringing this book into your life."
5,Awakens Something Primitive Within...,"""The most dramatic was one day in Saigon, when a buddhist parade started off with a sort of hypnotic chant of the yellow road priests marching along. And then there stepped forward a very frail old man in his seventies who turned out to be this priest of Ponduck, and he assumed the lotus posture and another priest stepped forward and poured gasoline on him. And then suddenly towering flame. The priests and the nuns in the audience moaned and prostrated themselves toward this burning figure. And he sat there unflinching and the smell of gasoline and burning flesh in the air, for ten minutes. The people thought they saw the face of Buddha in the clouds that night""If on mind altering drugs while listening/experiencing this album, well you're quite f*cked."
2,Dissapointed,"I have owned the observer watch for 3 years and while the main ""watch"" functions are good there are a couple of items that have really gotten under my skin. The alarm is almost inaudible and can not be fixed. (I can just here it if I am in a silent area with it up to my ear) The strap will break in about 2 years and nothing but a Suunto strap will fit it. Be prepared to pay between 50 and 100 dollars to replace.I would seriously consider either the Casio or Tisso types of this watch."
4,War Effort from Casey Robinson and Jacques Tourneur,The year was 1944. Screenwriter and producer Casey Robinson wanted to chronicle the harrowing and valiant resistance of the Russian people against the Nazi military machine that invaded their homeland in 1941. To give the film a look of realism Robinson went outside Hollywood to find fresh young faces for the leads. He cast New York theatre actor Gregory Peck and ballerina Tamara Toumanova to star. Robinson got Jacques Tourneur to director based on his imaginative work (CAT PEOPLE) for producer Val Lewton. There are some good action sequences but the film is weighed down by Robinson's own script that is full of long stretches of dialogue and many romantic interludes which detracts from the intended theme of the film. The film's greatest assets are Gregory Peck's performance as Vladimir the leader of the Russian resistance and Academy Award Nominated Special Effects by Vernon L. Walker.
1,It really molds!,"No, I mean it really grows mold. I left my glow in the dark pack in its case for jst two days, and it looks as if its growing teeth. It has these funny brown spots all over it, and there is some kind of fuzz growing on the sides of it.When you play with goooze, it is really cool, because its cold, and slips through your fingers. But you should play with it on something flat and slippery. I used a Wipe-off board, and it was just fine. If you play with it on wood, it might stain it. If you play with it on carpet, its like getting gum in your hair, only it doesn't come out with peanut butter.I bought two packs of goooze. One in the winter, and one in the summer. The green one I got in the winter got all hard and hairy within a week. The blue one I got in the summer got dirty and sticky in about 2 weeks. My point is to try to get Goooze in the warmer seasons.Either way, goooze is really fun. I recommend it to any kid who loves goopy stuff like Zyrofoam, Silly Putty, and play-doh."
2,Goooze,"My son, who is 10, received this as a Christmas gift. If you have younger siblings in the house I'd advise against having it in the house. You can't imagine how horrible it is to try and get it out of a 3 year old girl's long hair when she finds it and decides to wash her hair with it. I was however grateful for the warning on this web site which explained how to remove it."
5,Must have for the megatokyo fan,"If you are a Megatokyo fan, then you've already read everything in here online, so support Fred and buy it in print. If you are new to Megatokyo, then I'd suggest buying this along with all of the other volumes as well. Besides, you won't understand the story if you don't start at the beginning."
3,Pages 30-60 are screwed up.,"I don't know if it was a printer error or something but the pages from 30-60 are misprinted. Off the top of my head, page 30-something immediately goes to 60-something and continues for a good thirty-forty pages. Only until page 60 (the actual page) does the story progress normally."
5,Nice,"Third part of Megatokyo comic books, and I really like it. Even though it is free to read online, it is good enough that I decided to buy it and support the artist.I recommend it to anyone."
2,Awesomely redundant!,"I put my pizzas on this redundant thin plastic wafer when cooking. Ostensibly, this makes cleaning easier. Sure. Except that now I put both the pan -and- the Silicone Wonder Mat in the dishwasher when doing dishes. Also, one might think it reasonable that such a device, which is ""perfect for baking pizzas!"" would be resistant to knives or pizza rollers. It isn't. I guess they expected people to bake pizzas on it, but -not- to slice pizzas on it. Sorry, missed the demo. So now my redundant thin plastic wafer that makes cleaning easier has cuts in it. I find myself asking... why bother?"
3,"Not happy, but I guess it's my best option, so I'll buy it again..........","I have this phone at home. I've had it for 2 1/2 years and it's worked great. Then, it started dying. I'd speak on it for about 10 minutes, it would start beeping, and then the reception would cut out/die. I replaced the battery, but it still happened.I am so sick of spending good money on top-name electronics and then having them die in 2 years or less. I do not go for cheap, so this is especially distressing.I am not happy with this revelation, but reading all other cordless phone reviews, this one unfortunately got the best one (which is not saying much). I guess I'll have to buy it again, since I need a cordless phone and this gets the best reviews (again, the ""best"" is not really best, but best out there from what is available).Very maddening indeed."
3,My Phone,"I had a Panasonic phone when I bought this one and I thought this one would be much like it. was wrong. This one is too long, too heavy and the speaker quality is bad. Had I seen a review like this one I would not have bought it."
1,Bad experience with this phone,I purchased this phone recently and have very bad opinion about it. It sounds very noisy even at short distance from the Base. It is not switching the channel properly. It is hard to believe that 2.4GHZ phone is working such poorly in reception.
5,Wonderful recital!,"I remember, back in 1995, when Jose Carreras gave a recital for his Lukemia Foundation in Mexico City i did everything in my hands to see him, and i did. He is such a master of the recital. He knows how to select a program that will keep the audience at the edge of its seat for two hours. His singing is gorgeous, and he has a great stage presence. This recording at the Musikverein is wonderful. It made me live the performance in Mexico again. The Musicverein is the right place for a recital like this, and Jose just knew it. The emotion that he communicates is unbelievable. Truely a wonderful performance, a great program, and a great concert hall, nothing can top this."
3,Simply Marvelous,"Great music, especially for stationary bike workouts! What a talented group. I found it to be a very unique blend of sound. Very creative!"
2,More like Pilates beginner Mat Workout,"I wasn't impressed by this DVD. It is good for beginners and easy to follow, but it doesn't live up to it's ""intermediate"" title. I take pilates classes at my gym twice a week and thought adding an additional day at home would be beneficial to my wourkout regime however this DVD doesn't measure up to my regular pilates workouts. In short it's a bit boring and I can't feel the ""burn"" in my muscles."
1,RECALL THIS VIDEO!,"I am shocked that this video made it out onto the shelves for sale. The quality of the video is horrific-- the camera jerks in and out, the shots are from all sorts of angles (this was intentional but really ineffective). Pilates is suppose to be a workout where you concentrate on your body and mind together-- doing this is impossible with this video because it is so distracting. This video looks like a ""home-made"" MTV wanna-be. To top it off the instructor is trying way too hard to be cute. As for the workout if you want a total body, mind, spirit exercise do yoga. If you really think Pilates is the thing for you and want to stick with it stick with the veterans-- Kathy Smith, Jennifer Kreis, or the new one out by LivingArts, Suzanne Deason."
3,Pilates,"This is a good workout, however I was expecting it to be more challenging for an intermediate level."
5,Great Workout!,"This video has improved my abdominals so much. Just to say something about myself: I am currently training to be a certified pilates instructor and I am creating an ab workout website that will incorporate many of the techniques I have learned from pilates, yoga, and the gym into my routine. The web page will be up on April 15th and it's called [...]"
1,Quality Control asleep at the switch!,"The quality control people at Living Arts should be ashamed! This tape had both audio and video problems. The visual kept ""winking out"" and the audio varied from clear to echo-y and indecipherable. At the end, they actually pan back to show the group doing the taping - as if they were proud! Also, despite the listing of 40 minutes, it is only 30 minutes long. I was terribly disappointed and returned it."
1,DID NOT ENJOY THIS,I take mat pilates classes in a studio two times a week. I was looking for a video to take on the road with me when I travel and this is not the one for me. It was too short and there was no proper warm-up to get you warn and flexible and ready for the exercises.
2,Exact same workout as Pilates for Weight Loss,"This DVD is the EXACT same workout as theMaintenance Pilates for Weight LossDVD but with much lower production values. The workout takes 40 minutes here and only 30 minutes in the Maintenance video because they spend a lot more time explaining things. The only reason to recommend this video over the far superior production of Maintenance Pilates is if you need the explanations of the exercise or need to have someone doing a less intense version of the exercises. This is listed as an Intermediate level DVD but looks and feels just like the other beginning ones. If you have the Maintenance Pilates DVD don't waste your money. Also, if you're at all familiar with Pilates moves don't waste your money. Get the superior Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss."
4,Excellent way to tone your abs and legs,"I was interested in Pilates and wanted a challenging, yet, easy to follow tape. I am easily bored and often ditch workout tapes after only a few weeks.Not having used the Beginner's tape, I went ahead and just ordered the Intermediate one. I found that it was really easy to follow, the directions clear yet not overly simplified, and most importantly it kept by attention.I've been using the tape several times a week and notice a change in the waist line (I have one now) and how my clothes fit.The only drawback is the length of the tape (only about 30 minutes after all the intro chit-chat is done). I do start to ""glow"" while using this tape and I think if it were at least 45 minutes then it would be better. But then again, you can just do some of the exercises longer.If you are interested in pilates, then I'd recommend this tape."
4,1 word - RESULTS,"While I will admit that the production quality on the video leave a lot ot be desired... OK, the production quality is pretty bad, I am seeing results and to me - THAT is what counts.Production value: 1 StarWorkout value: 5 Stars!!!Currently I am alternating between this tape, the band work out (also with Ana Caban) and a ball tape and I am really enjoying it. I find the length of the workout to be perfect, I have just enough time for it without it infringing on my life. After 3 months, I am more flexable, my muscles are better toned, my asthma isn't near as bad as it used to be and my posture is improving too. (I began seeing results after about 3 weeks) Other workouts might provide the same results - but this is the only one I have been able to stick with long term.I would recomend starting with the beginning tape if you don't have any Pilates experience. I found it to be very helpful."
4,"A fine workout, very similar to Gaiam's Abs Workout.","It's true, the sound quality is pretty bad, but I didn't feel like I missed any of the instruction because of it. The production value in general just seams a little out of date. Gaiam really got the production right with other videos, like Ana Caban's Pilates Abs Workout. In fact, this workout is very similar to the Abs Workout video. This one's just a tad easier, and adds in some leg exercises and push ups. I love the Abs workout video, but it's very fast and intense. I think I will get use of this video, but I wouldn't reccommend owning both.. kind of unecessary. I'm hooked on Ana Caban though, and I wish she had more workouts available!"
3,not for beginners,"I got this as an unexpected christmas gift. The beginner video would have been better for me. I watched the video once, then got out my mat and followed along as best I could. I had told santa that I wanted some kind of pilates video to help me work on my weak abs, but I guess santa thought I was stronger than I really am! I do yoga 5 times a week a walk a lot, so I'm not totally out of shape. For three days after doing this pilates video workout my hamstrings, hips, and thighs were soooo sore. I couldn't touch my toes for a week, and I'm normally very flexible. However, no soreness in my abs. My guess is that I don't have the ab strength to do the exercises properly, so I didn't get the ab workout I was looking for. I think I'll keep this tape, and get the beginner version, as other reviewers have said it is a necessary prerequisite. How true! (The quality of the video sound is poor.)"
4,Great workout,"I did Ana's beginning mat workout for 2 weeks, then graduated to this one. I enjoy Ana's personality. She's calm and cues you through each exercise. I've surpirsed myself in being able to do almost all of the moves. It really increases your flexibility."
2,Fitness Seeker,"While the content of the exercise program is good, the production quality is abysmal. The sound swithces from normal to very echoing, dim and ""under-water"" sounding every third sentence. The visuals flicker, and alternate from color to black and white. The filming is very unsteady, as if the cameraperson is just a beginner. I contacted the company and they sounded very unconcerned about these problems! Because of this, I am reluctant to purchase another Living Arts-Gaiam product."
1,STOP and don't get burned,"If you are someone who is relying on a video for a challenging workout STOP and read this review. This is a beginning level tape-- there are only a few additional poses. I believe this tape demonstrates the same number of poses as the beginner video by Michelle Dozois- Pilates for Dummies. In addition, like other reviewers have noted the production is distracting.The intermediate and advanced videos by Scott Pilates are significantly better and more challenging, therefore more fulfilling."
1,"easy, boring, bad quality","gosh how disappointing. i paid a lot for this video from living arts and it is terrible. i won't go into the horrible production, but i must say this is no workout at all, and i just had a baby. my abs are weak, and i had no problem executing all the moves. i have a lot of dance and yoga and some pilates training, and this was so easy to me. i find yoga much more strengthening than pilates. maybe it's my bias (i've been teaching yoga for 3 1/2 years). one good thing is that it's nice to do it at home but i would prefer a much more challenging video to get some toning in. i don't understand how others find it effective for toning. i would recommend rodney yee's yoga for strength or yoga for energy instead. i also prefer the ballet workout videos."
3,Bonus Feature is worth owning!,"This poorly filmed workout is fine for beginners, but not very challenging! I was hoping for more. The bonus feature is short, but I think that part of the DVD makes it worth owning!"
2,slightly below average,"A nice pilates workout, not challenging enough though. The instructor isnt the best. I prefer MTV Pilates with Kristin McGee, almost all the same exercises are covered and Kristin is a better instructor. I had to sell my copy of the DVD on amazon."
1,Winsor Users Don't Waste Your Cash,"If you use the Winsor Pilates series, even the 20-minute basic DVD, please don't waste your money on this one. It's very basic."
2,Kinda cheesy,"I have taken a few pilates classes here in NYC. The moves are pretty much standard so no complaint on the workout aspect of the video. It's good for people that just need some kind of order for their workout. However, the presentation of the video is kind of weird. It fluctuates between two cameras. One professional and the other a home-video qualitiy video camera. Overall, it's okay."
4,graduated to intermediate,"If you have the beginner video, this is good follow up video. Same basic moves at a slightly faster pace."
3,"Good workout, too much talking!","Overall, I enjoyed the workout, but had a few complaints. This consists of a intermidiate mat workout of approximately 26 minutes and then another quick 13 minute workout.She gives very specific instructions which help improve my technique. One of my complaints is that there is long intros and her talking too much. It was fine the first time around, but now that I've been doing the video, I have to forward to her talking. I also wish she would introduce more moves and make it a bit longer."
5,Pilates Beginning Mat Workout,"This video is excellent. The DVD is even better than the VHS because of the 12 minute workout. It's perfect for after work. The best thing about pilates is that you feel awake and alive again after the workout rather than like you need to take a nap. Ana Caban is an excellent instructor because she allows for many stages of accomplishment in your workout. Even after you have done it 30+ times, you can still adjust your workout to be effective and feel challenged."
2,Not very challenging!,"I consider myself a high intermediate to low advanced exerciser. I was reading some of the reviews for this workout, and thought to give it a try. I was very dissapointed after doing it, because it did not challenge me at all. I had expected so much more from this routine, that I thought it is a kind of joke, when Ana Caban said she's done at the end. I would rather recommand the 10 Min. Solution Pilates with Lara Hudson. If you do the whole hour of this, then you really get a great workout. I hope I can sell this DVD soon. I would only recommand it to someone, who is at a beginner level with doing Pilates. It gives a good view of all the main pilates exercises."
1,Very disappointed,"First of all, Ana doesn't announce whther she's doing a warm-up. She also doesn't explain the moves very well. Unless you know some Pilates basic moves, this DVD is hard to follow. I would not purchase another one by her."
1,Pilates Intermediate Mat Workout,This is a horrible pilates workout. First of all the production quality is the worst. The camera jumps around and the sound is barely audible at times. If I am paying for something it better be done professionally. There is no warm-up. There is no real instruction to each exercise so you better know what you are doing. And if you do know what you are doing then what is the point of buying this video. You are wasting your money. If you know how to do pilates no need to buy this video. Just do it yourself. Unless you want to be annoyed.
1,dissapointing DVD,"I bought this DVD and when I got it home and put it in the DVD player, it said that there is NOTHING on the disk. I thought that the company would have some kind of quality controll. I am taking it back later today and if I am given an issue about this I will never buy one of there tapes again, let alone use Target. I gave one star because you can not give 0."
5,Excellent instruction,"This is a great program for those who have mastered some of the basics and want a more challenging Pilates workout. Unlike beginner videos, Caban doesn't stop the flow of the exercise to give instruction, but she does give excellent cuing that still keeps the workout safe. The energy sprint is great for days when workout time is limited."
2,A good workout once it gets started...,"I bought this workout to augment my weekly pilates class. I think it provides a good workout once it gets started, but only after you're forced to sit through 5 minutes of warings, copyright boilerplate, and GAIAM commercials! That's really my only beef. And don't think you can just skip through it.My morning work-around is to turn on the dvd player, go brush my teeth and shave, then begin pilates.I'd suggest finding a different company's DVD or buy the VHS version, where it'seasy to skip all the cruft at the beginning."
1,Don't do it to yourself!,I want to send out a word of advice because I think most of the people buying this video are like me. They bought the first one of the series so instead of having to do more research people are just picking up the same one because it's easy and it seems logical.Don't do it! This video does not add much value. I have now purchased 3 other videos for intermediate level workouts and they are leaps and bounds better than this one. Without seeing other videos you really don't know what you don't know. This one is distracting and the exercises aren't much more challenging.Hillary Burnett's intermediate video is excellent and Karen Voight's total body workout is also very good.
1,My old Panasonic 900MHz Phone is Far better than this,"This phone does not work even in my small two bedroom aparment. I never had any problems with my old panasonic cordless phone. If I move from one room to other room while talking, it will start giving static noises(even if i am not far more than 20 feet). I also moved the base unit from my living room to one of the bed rooms, still same problem. I am returing this product back to Amazon.Pros:1. Looks great2. Cell phone like Phone book is very helpfullCons:1. Give lots of static noise if you go far away from base."
4,Unusually good fish cookbook,"Despite its low price on Amazon, this is a standout fish cookbook. One of its notable features is that the index cross-references similar fish. For example, if you happen to have red snapper, you'll find that the index points you to some very good recipes for striped bass and grouper that work well with the snapper. The recipe for salmon with fresh basil sauce by itself is worth the price of the book."
5,A must read if you own ISOs or NQSOs,"I've read every news paper article, taken several educational classes, and devoured water cooler gossip on how best to take advantage of stock options. This book sets the record straight on how to save your precious option $$ from tax erosion. It's tough reading, best done with pencil, paper, and calculator in hand, but worth every penny you spent!"
2,"Lots about taxes, little about other regulations","I bought this book and was hoping to see a clear description of SEC Rule 144 and other rules restricting sale of nonregistered stock. In the 80s Rule 144 meant you had to exercise your options and then hold them two years before you could sell them to anyone except the company that issued them. This is different now, but I am not clear on how. I would also have liked to see something on insider trading restrictions and lock-up agreements (which also restrict sale). This book does not tell the stock option novice what he/she needs to know at all about what the best approach is. In my experience I have made the most when I exercised as early as possible and then held the stock for 5+ years, but if that's the right strategy, what do we need options for?"
2,Just the basics. No mention of reloading strategies.,"Clearly written examples take you through the basics. The discussion of Alternative Minimum Tax considerations is too small. In the description it claims the book will tell you ""why it may take a long time to claim the AMT credits"" but the text devoted to that is very limited. The practice of ""reloading"" is not even mentioned in this book. Hey, maybe I should write a book on reloading strategies???"
3,Not for employers but for employees with stock options,If you are an employer this book is NOT for you. This book is written to employees with stock options. If you have stock options this book gives you great advice on how to use these options to your tax benefit.
4,Helped me,"This book helped me greatly with some stock options I got from my work. I had NSO stock and had not idea how the taxes worked out on it and when the best time was to exercise.Well this book, I made a good decision and made $80,000 on my stock options."
5,2nd Dispenser Purchase,"I should have purchased this item in the 1st place. I had previously bought the Better Living Clear Choice 4 chamber dispenser, which I was satisfied with except for the fact that the lid to that item did not seal very well and allowed water to get into the products I had in the chambers. I don't expect to have that problem with this dispenser."
2,Better Living The Dispenser Classic 4 Chamber,the glue to mount dispenser on the wall was dried up on both chirstmas giftsnot good.hope this can help? the one we bought before these tow er are pleared with.
2,Cheap and only good for permanent residence,"This product is made of extremely cheap parts and doesn't hold up well at all. I'm upset because the arm didn't fit with my shower head and even if it did, I doubt it would have been able to hold any weight. There is another option for using this product but it only works if you plan on living somewhere for a while or are not renting. The second option to mount is a permanent option...meaning, it's NEVER COMING OFF! Not great for me when I rent. I tried a little something of my own and it came crashing to the floor and broke into a TON of pieces. I know I should have just returned it, but the very short distance it fell should not have resulted in that many pieces of plastic on the floor."
4,Long time customer!! Long lasting product!!,"I purchased my 1st Dispenser IV after seeing it in an airline catalogue about 13 yrs ago and have been a big fan ever since! I have them in all my bathrooms and give them for wedding shower gifts, housewarming gifts etc. The Dispenser looks great, works great and lasts long! I bought another brand once because they did not sell The Dispenser brand at the store I was in and it ended up being a waste of money...it fell off the wall the second day I had it! My only complaint would be that it dispenses only a small amount of shampoo with each pump (I have longer hair and have to pump it about 10 times to get enough shampoo). Obviously I am used to it by now and still think it's terrific! SO much better than shampoo bottle clutter! Buy it and enjoy!"
4,Definitely a must have,We have used these for years. It eliminates the mess and the rust that can form on the bottom of bottles sitting in your bath or shower. It saves money by buying in bulk (1 gallon soap and 1 liter bottles of shampoo and condtioner) not to mention the hassle of trying to get the last bit out of the small bottles while you are showering. The only complaint is that you should be prepared to order additional units so that you have access to more of the bottles as the dispenser tends to leak or quit working over time. Also be very careful when opening the main unit holding the bottles as the plastic lock tends to break.
5,Fort Wayne Indiana,Great product to replace one I had for many years. Product well made to last for years. Would recommend this product
4,Good,Works as said. Bought to replace one we had used in our trailer. This was about the same so had no trouble
2,low end dispenser,This is not the quality I thought it would be. You have to pump about 7-10 times to get enough shampoo for the job. The weird thing is the conditioner comes out at a different rate and so do the other two pumps. I wanted something that you pushed once or twice at the most for the perfect amount.
1,Save your money,After four months this product fell off the wall. The shampoo and soap leaked out. I really loved this product. I even recommended to my family. I was going to try to purchase a heavy duty adhesive from Home Depot to mount it again but the cover has cracked. The cover will not reattach. I called the manufacturer and they have one for $6 and $15 shipping. Considering the amount I paid for the dispenser and the four products we lost I'm calling it quits.We still have a two soap dispenser. Will update when/if that falls.
3,Functions well but...,"You need to be careful opening and closing the cover, the latch is prone to breakage. We also had a crack form on the soap (most used) pump which still works but leaks soap and needs replacing. I'll be buying another unit and keeping the older one for parts. It could be made of a more resiliant plastic, probably for slightly more money, but worth it in my opinion. Overall a good device with careful usage."
3,Good idea but..,"Great idea, and when it works its great. I have 3 of these units, they are light weight and will not take more than average abuse. Problem is when the product is thick ie some conditioners or shampoos, the pumping action can be very slow. Also in about a year I have had to replace 2 pumps which completely failed. Still I like the concept."
5,bought for gifts,I have owned this dispenser for about 20 years. I bought the ones from Amazon for gifts. I have nothing but good things to say about mine. Sure does keep the shower/tub area uncluttered and clean. Easy to refill bottles.
4,"I like it alot, but...1 thing","Works as wonderful as every other reviewer says, and stays on solid.Only problem is, very thick things like Conditioner, good luck. It pumps out fine, but the trouble is filling it. Went everywhere when trying to squeeze it out of the bottle, and because the refill opening at top is so small there wasn't anything to do about the mess. If the opening up top was bigger, it wouldn't have been nearly as messy to fill nor would it go flying out of the top when trying to squeeze it out of the bottle. I'm not sure what i can do for the next time i fill it, i don't want to water it down to get it out.Everything else filled fine however, and would easily hit a 5 of 5 review if i knew a better way for the thick conditioner. Would i buy it again? in a heartbeat but it makes you think twice about how thick your conditioner is."
4,Works Great!!,"I'd been searching for one of these caddies for the longest time. I was so excited when I received it. It's compact, not too ""clean room-looking"" & oh so much easier than having bottles all over the place. I gave it 4 stars, however, only because when I went to install it, the silicone glue it came with had dried up in it's own tube! -But nothing a little ceramic glue couldn't take care of.. I'm delighted with it.. Also, if you're planning on filling a container with say moisture-rich body wash, I suggest you dilute it a bit; thick liquids do have a hard time coming out of the nozzles.."
5,Sleek organization,Easy to install and declutter your shower. Always end up sending these as gifts after family and friends stay at the house and love them. Simplify your shower area with clean sleek lines.
4,Very happy with this product,"I bought this to consolidate all of the bottles I had and I love it. I installed this myself and I have had no problems with it so far. Make sure you read the instructions because there are specific instruction on how to get the pump started.Here are some cons I have with this item:-My husband thinks it looks ugly (I think it looks okay)-It have to push the buttons at least 3-4 times each to get the amount I need, but helps keep me frugalOther than those cons, I love my dispenser and I will definitely buy it again if I move."
5,This product is awesome!,I bought this item when I got married 9 years ago! We had it in our apartment bath and loved it so much we took it with us when we bought our house! It has lasted us 9 years! The only reason I am getting a new one was because my husband dropped his while filling it and broke the bottle! Thats what happens when I let him fill it for the first time in 9 yrs! We did screw ours to the wall but only because we knew we would have it for years to come. I am actually relieved I could find another exactly like the one I have It's a MUST have for you bath if you ask me!
5,Sleek Shower Dipsenser,I had one of these for over 20 years. It finally gave out and I have purchased a new one. There are no bottles in the shower giving the bathroom a more streamlined look. An added benefit is using less product.
4,installation problem,"The dispenser arrived with detailed mounting instructions, but the silicone adhesive looked cloudy, and a large lump of it had solidified in the tube. I used what I could get out of the tube, and it seemed OK until I filled the dispenser. It fell within a few hours. I couldn't send it back, because I had about $25 worth of products in it, and had thrown the original containers away. However, the dispenser doesn't seem to be damaged, and is working fine. I'm annoyed that I had to go buy a $5 tube of silicone to remount it, but that was less trouble/expense than sending it back. So really, I paid $5 more for it than the advertised price--not the bargain I anticipated."
4,nice piece,works great. Had one before and the bottles started leaking after about ten years. so was worth buying another one
5,Perfect,"This thing is great. I use much less product because I always squeezed too much out of the regular bottle. It was easy to install and uses silicone plus double sided tape, so it should hold."
5,Dispenser,Purchased this item after seeing on in a motel. Very useful gets rid of a lot of bottles and simple to install. Wife likes it allows her to jut hit a button and not have to mess with caps on bottles. Eliminates slippery hands
1,Don't waste your time with this CD!,"I was dissapointed with this very monotonous voice only CD and it seems to focus on relaxation rather than intuition (track 2 is solely a relaxation track). There are far better produced products that you can buy from Glenn Harrold or Dr. Andrew Weil and his associates. The latter products are far more interesting and offer music and/or more in depth explanations and insights for hypnosis and specific objectives you may want to achieve. In comparison with them, I found this CD to be a total waste of money and I returned it."
3,Okay book,Tommy Frazers dad just got married.now tommy got a new mom.and he going to a new school.tommy gets lost at that school it is very big.also theres a class room with black and white people in there this is a okay book it has a wierd endening
5,Unique! A new style of R.L. stine!,"I loved it! It was very interesting, I could'nt put it down! I'm over thirteen years old but i still love it. What i like about the goosebumps series is that every age group usually loves it! This book strayed a little away from what I have known R.L. Stine to write, but it was still good. The title is deceptive though. It says ""The Haunted School"", but this book wasn't really about ghosts. I think a better title would be ""The secret of grayworld"""
2,Confusing and unnecessarily complicated,"Of all the cheese books I've read, this was supposed to be the most important - but I don't find it useful at all. It's overly complicated and offers little in the way of practical knowledge. And, if you ask the professors at USU - Logan, they'll tell you the chemistry isn't right, either. I can't speak to that personally, since I rely on experts for knowledge about chemistry. I just know this book has not contributed anything to my cheese making skills, mostly because I have never gotten all the way through it. There are better and more practical books out there - buy them."
4,Karen Darbinyan,This book is a great asset for start-up cheesemakers. I am from Aremnia and I own small new cheesemaking business. Thanks to this book many things got clear for me and my business.Good combinition of art and science.
4,Invaluable For the Home Cheesemaker,"This book is a very useful reference for the home cheesemaker for all stages from set up, fine tuning your recipes, troubleshooting problems, and insights into the business side, if you want to go that way. It contains enough chemistry and biology to allow you to adjust the your cheese recipes according to the individual batch parameters.The discussion on Pasteurization is very helpful for understanding the raw milk dilemma, and the story of the problems the author encountered establishing his own business is inspiring."
5,Essential Indutrial Synth and Guitar Band!,"An essential release for the synth/guitar/industrial scene. Well thought out programming, good beats, good samples, nice chunky guitars. This is a cd for every fan of the genre!"
3,dissapointing double feature,"Despite a great video transfer and digital sound, this is still a dissapointing DVD. The formulaic trailors are dull(why didn't they showcase the originals?), the commentary by Bava and company is at best ear-jarring, and also some of the original score is ommited, leaving some scenes totally devoid of suspense. View these movies only in their original form. Other than that... buy this DVD at your own viewing risk."
3,Every thing I need to know I learned from watching Demons,"1. Never accept complimentary tickets to the cinema.2. Never watch a TV documentary about Demon uprisings.3. If you are blind, don't take your only daughter to an evil movie theater.4. If you are a dog, don't even bark at demon blood.5. If its your party, don't sulk in your bedroom. Even if you want to.6. Leave lying Nostrodamus corpses lay.7. If you know the movie theater you're attending is evil, say something.8. If you are a gang of punk rockers on the run from the cops, don't take refuge in an evil movie theater.9. Never bleed on a thirsty demon corpse.10. If you're not confused by Italian horror, you have not properly understood it."
2,DEMONS not as good as some would lead on.,"First off, let me say that this is stylishly directed and has a promising story idea. However, logic, and character development is nowhere to be found in this Italian horror film produced by Dario Argento and directed by Lamberto Bava (son of Mario Bava). Bad dubbing + horrible dialogue + inappropriate 80s rock music + terrible acting = A FILM YOU CAN EASILY PASS ON. If you're still curious ... rent it first!!"
4,Demons 2=Evil Dead 2,"Although both films suffer from some really stupid dialogue--dubbed or not--I found Demons 2 to be the more enjoyable and more ""creative"" of the two. Yes, it goes for the humor as Evil Dead 2 did, but it also mixes in a lot of Die Hard action, and manages to juggle three or four different plots/scenes at the same time. The Karen Black devil doll in the apartment homage is wonderful. As a double feature, this is a great package.Due to the heavy Italian accents, I have never made it through any of the commentaries. After about 10 minutes, I give up. And, although I haven't heard much, I have to admit that what they are saying isn't very interesting---""We filmed this in the country."" ""This was filmed at the library on Sunday when it was closed."" ""I have no memory of this actor; he was very pleasant, that it all."" And so on..."
2,Not much fun.,"Review of DemonsA group of people stuck in a big movie theater have to take on hideous demons. Very popular Italian gorefest has some really excellent make-up effects and a fun premise, but it's just not entertaining. The lighting's too dark, the action is confusingly filmed, and the story keeps cutting back to a useless subplot about a coke-snorting gang! Props to the lead actor, though, who looks like a cross between Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Dolph Lundgren! Stick with Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead or Night of the Demons for a much scarier rollercoaster ride with a similar premise.* 1/2 out of *****"
5,Not a bad place to start,"Alice Donut were one of the finest bands of the late 80's/early 90's, and if you ever saw them live you would have been a fan for life. Lyrics that required some thought to write, excellent two guitar interplay and the occasional trombone combine for a lovely green meat stew of punk rock (if you must pigeonhole them). Every song on this live album is one of their best, performed during a tight live CBGB show complete with hilarious between song banter. If you buy this and ""get it"", then immediately purchase the rest of their catalog before it gets really hard to find. If you buy this and don't ""get it"", stick to things like Blink 182 until you have your first child and start amassing Sting and Michael Bolton records. Good luck."
5,ALICE COMES ALIVE!!!!!,"THIS WAS THEIR FIRST ALBUM I HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME HEARING ABOUT THIS GREAT ALTERNATIVE PUNK FREAK POP BAND IN DECEMBER 2000BY MY SISTERS EX BOYFRIENDS HOUSE.I WAS AMAZED BY THE LIVE, RAWSET THEY PLAYED THAT NIGHT THIS ALBUM WAS RECORDED.I LOVE HOW TOMAS ANTONA MAKES FUN OF PAUL STANLEY INSTEAD OF SAYIN COLD GIN HOW WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A TASTE OF ROBITUSSIN!!!!! I WAS ON THE FLOOR LAUGHING WHEN I HEARD THAT, HA HA HA THIS WHOLE ALBUM COMBINES ELEMENTS OF JANE'S ADDICTION, SLAP OF DEAD KENNEDYS OF HEAVY SARCASM LYRICS WISE.HANDS DOWN THE BEST UNRATED LIVE RECORDIVE HEARD IN A WHILE,I THINK BETTER THAN MOST LIVE ALBUMS BY BANDS TODAY CUZ TODAY'S GARBAGE IS NOTHING COMPARED TO DONUT'S MATERIAL. PROPERLY PACKAGED WASTE BOX OF NON CREATIVE ARTISTSIS ALL WE SEE NOW. SO DO ME A FAVOR THROW UR T.V. OUT THE WINDOW AND CORPORATE ROCK CD'S OUT THE WINDOW AND REVAMP UR COLLECTION BY STARTIN WITH THIS CD AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU SUCK DOGTURDS."
2,Suarez is good but not his writing.,"Suarez is obviously a subject matter expert on tactical movement. However, the book is aimed at to large of an audience and it is difficult to pick out that information which applies to you.This book has some useful information for police officers and tactical types but much of that information is not placed in the context that it should be used. The author tried to make his information relevant in all cases and that is not reality. If he had written parts for just cops and then other parts for non-cops it would have been great.However, I did learn something from the book. I liked the authors explanation of three man point movements.I hope Suarez writes a book on tactical team operations. It should be filled with relevant information."
5,Must Read,"This is a must read for any cop, rookie to veteran. Its well written and is supported with both diagrams and photographs to explain the concepts. As a cop, it would be a SEVERE oversight not to read this book. If going home after each shift to your family means something to you, then read this book."
5,Troubleshoot your serger problems,"This book goes over what can go wrong when you serge--and it has lots of advice on making it go right. As an example, I was relearning my serger after a long hiatus. I had forgotten a lot of how to use the machine. At one point, I started to hear a loud ""clack"" when I stitched. The book let me know that a burred or dull needle will make a rhythmic clicking or clacking sound as it pulls up from the fabric. I changed the needle and the old needle did indeed have a burr on the end--I could feel it when I ran my finger down the point. If you are trying to get your rolled hems perfect or prevent loopy edges or any other number of issues that sergers can have, this is your guide."
5,book,looks like I have ordered several books and all used so am enjoying all of them in our sewing room.
4,"Right serger, wrong reason","I order the book for an entirely different reason, thinking it would help me repair my machine. Instead, I found the book very informative and instructive for use of a serger. It would be very effective fo a new user and owner of a serger sewing machine. I am glad I bought it if even for the wrong reason."
4,Excellent reference book,"This book is excellent for reference - for those times when you just can't figure it out yourself, or your serger manual doesn't cover the issue (or is too confusing to understand). I wish there were more photo descriptives, as opposed to the line drawings provided, but overall, a handy book to have."
5,great help book,I found this book very help full with using my serger. This book I would tell anyone who is serious about sewing o have in thier collection/ easyto under stand.
5,Superior Trouble-Shooter!,"While this is not a serger guide for the novice seamstress or tailor, it is a valuable resource for one's sewing library. I'm grateful to have it as a reference to use when I'm up against an issue with which I'm unfamiliar. Sergers are a huge asset to the sewer and this text helps facilitate confidence! It arrived immediately, well wrapped, fairly priced and in stellar condition. I'll be back for sure!"
5,Good Job!,Great care and speed! Enjoyed the experience. Will order again with pleasure. Thank you so much for the nice book.
4,great resources,This book really helped clear up a lot of questions regarding sergers and opened up great new possiblities! Not biased in its reviews of different brands!
4,The Ultimate Serger Answer Guide,"As I am only in the process of learning to use the serger and I have not run across many problems for which this book can be used, I know that this is a book I'll want to keep right beside the serger to help solve any problems that may occur so I can get back quickly to my sewing project."
4,A sergers side kick,"I'll admit that when I purchased my serger, I knew very little. With the help of this book, I've been able to get over the ""fear"" of my serger."
2,ho hum,"this book was a major disappointment. there are very few pages, ugly illustrations, and there should have been more information, such as threading. it is basically a trouble shooting guide for tensions, and it looks very good for that, but ""ultimate"" it isn't."
2,The Ultimate Serger Answer Guide,This book is totally focussed on troubleshooting serger problems. It has good pictures and great solutions to correct all types of problems. It is a wonderful resource to have on hand because it addresses many situations that other books might not. I am glad I bought it and highly recommend this book. Also keep in mind that this book is a great supplement for your other serger books.
5,Excellent insight for lasting romance and love in your life,"I have read several Gary Smalley books as well as many other marriage books. This is one of my all time favorites because of the easy reading, interesting personal stories and chapter synopsis. Smalley's book should be a prerequisite for all couples. Get it and enjoy!"
5,A must for every couples' library,There are many books about Christian love and many books about how to make love last forever. I would suggest this book over most others. Gary is a brilliant and insightful writer. I suggest this book for any Christian (or non-Christian) to reinforce how to make love last forever.
4,"Sensible, Succint, and worth the money.","Garey Smalley presents a grand way to preserve a marriage: Develop a spiritual relationship with your spouse that outlasts ephemeral physical desire. While this is not a new idea, Smalley's personal presentation keeps the reader interested and tuned in."
4,Dreams realized,"The music is solid, the lyrics touch the heart. Ms. Brackett proves without a doubt she is as talented with her voice as she is with her hands. A true Artist."
1,Rip Off - Isn't really an RF remote,"This claims to be an RF remote. But buried in the manual is a note that you can't actually use it as an RF remote to directly control RF components. Instead, you have to buy the Powerblaster accessory, which costs more than the remote.Since this isn't really a RF remote, they shouldn't put ""RF Capability"" in its title. And they need to make it very clear in the description that you cannot use it to control RF components.If you don't care about RF, there are cheaper remotes than this. If you do care about RF, there are cheaper RF remotes than the price of this plus the powerblaster. So why buy this one?"
2,Universal Learning Remote,Probably OK but would not fully learn the volume control function for an Olevia TV. Instructions lacking for use of the DVR controls.
4,Home Theater RF-10,"I really like this universal remote. It's fully programmable for the difficult components and,along with the RF powerblaster, line of sight is no longer necessary."
3,could be better,"The light leaves much to be desired...we bought it mostly because it lights up, but the light is red for some reason, and does not light the buttons very well. Otherwise, it does what it is supposed to do, and is fairly easy to program, as long as you are good are following the manual directions."
3,URC RF10,"This is a great remote and works wonderfully. However, it will do a few macros, but does not do discrete power. If you need a basic remote to control everything without many extra features, this is great. If you need more control and fancier operations I recommend the RF20."
3,Great until sides split out,"I loved these slippers - warm and comfortable. Love Haflinger products. After a few months the side slplit out of one and then the other. Now my foot stays warm except for my baby toe. Also, keep in mind that these have wool bottoms, so no going outside!"
5,Great as far as workout videos go!,"This is my only workout video, so I don't have anything to compare this with. I can say that it's been helpful and I do pop it into the VCR every now and then. It helps that there is a choice between the beginner and the more advanced level. I usually do the beginner level and after the tape is done I've had a pretty good stretch and workout. I can't see how anyone could fault this video. It's got my okay."
2,Pilates--the fastest beginner version in the world,"Having been introduced to pilates by my sister-in-law, I was looking for a good DVD to help me continue to grow in strength and toning. While I did like the 10 minute introduction to the Pilates method and history of the excerices, Ana was far to fast and didn't allow me to ensure the excersices were done correctly. This could have been avoided if her routine wasn't just 20 minutes! I recommend the Stott Pilates video combinations. Moira Stott-Merrithew has her assistant do the excerises, while Stott leads and directs the assistant's movements--just like a real class! I can't wait for these to come out on DVD!"
5,Best Workout Video Ever,"This tape has really worked for me. I've done it tons of times and I'm still not sick of it. It's quick easy (kind-of) no sweat work out that does actually work. It's convinced me to quit my gym and just use tapes. It' s quicker, cheaper, and the level of instruction can be far better. My gym offered an into pilates class and I was the star, all because of the wonderful instruction on this tape!"
2,Not real good,"I didn't really like this video at all. It goes the right pace the first couple of exercises, but then she goes so fast, I'm not really sure what I'm doing. I didn't feel sore the next day as I hoped I would. I wouldn't really recommend this video to anyone. Maybe regular classes with real live trainers would be better at first, so you know you're doing the exercises right, and then get a video."
4,great for the inflexible beginner,I really like this dvd. It was recommended to me by a pilates instructor. It goes at a nice slow pace. She demonstrates the more advanced and the beginner version. I was able to do most of the moves because I had a choice of how much to push myself. It's 20 minutes and I really felt it in my abs. There's another workout on this dvd but I'm not at that level yet.
2,"Good workout, horrible production quality","The video has a good workout with alternatives for beginners and slightly more advanced users for each exercise, but the intentional unsteady cam and cuts to strange angles with awful lighting/color effects makes it a less than stellar total package."
5,Authentic,"I have taken Pilates classes for a few years. My instructor is very traditional. She studied at the studio in New York under a woman who was a protege of Joseph Pilates. This is the only beginning Pilates DVD she recommends. I use it occasionally between classes, just to reinforce the basics. It is very true to what I have learned from my instructor."
4,"A very good, basic beginners workout.","This is a terrific introduction to Pilates. You'll feel like you got a great workout in just 20 minutes, and the instructor is an excellent teacher, moving not too quickly, nor too slowly."
4,Better explanations,"The first Pilates takes I got were the Mari Winsor ones. And she would use terminology in that without explaining it. Like ""Pilates stance"". So I got this video instead, and it explained it for me. I seem to like using this video more than Mari's, though it's been so long since I used Mari's video that I couldn't tell you why. I like that there are variations to each exercise in case you can't do them, mostly because there are still a few that I can't manage. I mix this video with the BodyRing video and after a few weeks, I definately discovered ab muscles that I hadn't known existed."
5,This Is the One to Buy!,"I love this workout! The DVD itself is exceptionally set-up. Whether you want an introduction to Pilates, to learn about the intructor Ana Caban, or to go straight to the workout, you can navigate all the options with ease. Plus, the DVD includes a bonus energy-boosting workout that is fun and works! The workout itself is about twenty-five minutes and moves at a slow, easy to follow pace. Once you are familiar with each exercise, the pace allows you to fully concentrate each movement for the greatest impact. Ana Caban gives clear, concise intructions for the beginner and more advanced. She also adds a sense of humor to the workout and is very likable. I have no crticism and will purchase her Intermediate Mat Workout as soon as I am ready!"
1,Spread the WORD!,"I have had dull lower back pains for over 2 months consistently now. I have gone to several doctors and the last one I went to immediately asked about my exercise patterns and probed into the pilates instruction I have been using. I was shocked to hear from him that he has been seeing numerous patients who now have back pain resulting from improper pilates instruction. He even named off this instructor as a primary contributor to the problems his patients are experiencing! I couldn't believe it! Now I am in therapy for my back and will be for at least another 6 months. This is a total travesty and both the instructor and LivingArts should be held accountable. Please spread the word-- this instructor is really doing more harm than good.The good news about pilates is that it is a safe exercise and very beneficial if done properly with good, solid instruction. My doctor was very knowledgable and recommended Michelle Dozois, Jennifer Kreis, and Karen Voight... names I have seen before."
5,Great video,"This video is great for those who want to start excercising again or for those who do not have enough time and yet want to do some excercise.Understand that this video is for stretching and toning, not for shaping the figure. Ana Caban gives a clear explanation on how to do the moves and at the end you feel energized and not tired at all. It is a very good video and I strongly recommend it."
4,"Good workout, but Ana is a little annoying","This is definitely a good workout if you're new to pilates. Ana does show the viewer the modified version, but Tara (the person in the background), quickly switches from that version to the same one that Ana is doing.I still can't figure out what it is that annoys me about Ana, but I like someone like Suzanne Deason a lot better. Also, Ana's video has a lot of goofy camera angles - making it a little hard to follow.Overall, a good workout."
1,BE WARNED! Don't be mislead and disappointed,"I bought this video based on the reviews and was very disappointed. The instruction does not cover all the important elements of The Pilates Method and leaves you wanting. In addition, the workout itself is very short and for me, it did not give me the satisfaction I look for at the end of a workout. I was so baffled by the positive reviews that I went back through them to see what people were writing-- I found that there are several reviewers that echo my disappointment, but they are buried and definitely the minority. My advice is not to follow the crowd and if you really want a Pilates video stick with a video by an instructor that's been in circulation for a while-- Jennifer Kreis, for example-- that shows that the quality has passed the test of time. This one is definitely a passing fad."
2,so so,"i like anna's personality and her instruction but it's very hard to get past the overly-creative camera angles and disorienting, choppy edits. you don't really get to see her doing one pose or procedure from one angle for a long enough period of time to really learn it well. i found that very distracting.i've tried it once and gave up mid-way through the work-out; and haven't tried it again since. i don't want to work out to a tape and not be sure that what i'm doing is right because i can't follow her closely enough. it seems as if she's a great instructor- but loose the no-attention-span video editing. i have other friends that feel the same way. instead, we all have enjoyed denise austin's pilates/yoga workout tapes. i wouldn't recommend ana cabans pilates tape to a beginner who needs careful instruction; pilates can be stressful on the body if you don't do the movements right."
2,BE WARNED! Don't be mislead and disappointed,"I bought this video based on the reviews and was very disappointed. The instruction does not cover all the important elements of The Pilates Method and leaves you wanting. In addition the workout itself is very short and for me, did not give me the satisfaction I look for at the end of a workout. I was so baffled by the positive reviews that I went back through them to see what people were writing-- I found that there are several reviewers that echo my disappointment, but they are buried and definitely the minority. My advice is not to follow the crowd and if you really want a Pilates video stick with a video by an instructor that's been in circulation for a while-- Jennifer Kreis, for example-- that shows that the quality has passed the test of time. This one is definitely a passing fad."
2,Spend your money on a class instead!,"... The quality of the video is quite poor, both the instruction and the filming technique leave A LOT to be desired. The instructor barely cues breathing at all, which is such an esential part of doing Pilates correctly. The class itself is way too short and the sequencing of exercizes doesn't flow. ..."
4,A True Beginners Tape,"I am not in very good shape, but I made it through the whole tape on only my second try. You have to want to do this. It is not easy, but Ana say this in the beginning of the tape. I feel so much better today. If you like Yoga you will love this. I plan to continue to beginners tape until I have mastered it and move on to the next tape."
2,Boring,"I bought this dvd and was really disappointed with it. I used it two or three times, but I was so bored by the slow pace and ""relaxed"" setting that I gave up on it. I guess it would be good for someone looking to slow down and take the stress off, but I have enough trouble getting motivated that I don't need something putting me to sleep! ;)"
2,Can you keep up?,"Nice teacher but tape is too ambitious for a beginner. She moves too fast between exercises.The editing is just terrible-choppy, constantly changing angles, color fades in and out. Like a home movie.Go for the Pilates for Dummies if you don't want to be frustrated."
3,not worth it,This routine was extremely short. I felt like I had just gotten started and it was over. I got this at target with the intermediate workout but I will be buying a different routine to work out with in the future.
3,pilates introduction - not a repeat workout,"I liked doing the workout once or twice, and it has both clear instructions and good production. However, the amount of instruction and time spent talking about holding the abs, breating, positions, etc. makes it not a great workout to use and reuse, which is what I like. It's useful to get pilates moves, but you'd do better getting this from netflix or the video store, because I found it got really annoying to do this one more than a couple of times."
1,READ the warning label,"This is not a beginners tape-- it doesn't provide enough instruction on breathing and proper form, which is so critical to not only performing the exercises in a safe manner but realizing the benefits of Pilates. The production is totally distracting and the workout itself is short and choppy. TRY THE NEW LIVING ARTS PILATES VIDEO WITH SUZANNE DEASON-- read the reviews-- this is the kind of video you really want-- beautiful scenery, soothing voice and solid instruction. Although it says its for weight loss it's a tougher workout than this one!"
2,Very Hard,I tried this tape and I was not able to do the first 5 minutes. This is NOT a beginners tape. What they mean is a beginner who is already in very good shape. They do NOT mean people who have never done this before and are not in good shape.Be for warned!
1,Can't get past the annoying instructor,"I can't say much about the workout since Ana Caban kept astonishing me with her narissistic attitude and her coy mugging for the camera. A friend of mine tried the tape it as well and asked me, ""Did she REALLY say that?"""
2,Too cutsie for the person who is serious about exercise,"While the instructor's form is excellent, this workout is too short and places too much focus on limited muscle groups like abs and legs. There is little focus on the back, arms, shoulders and buttocks. In addition, this instructor has a truly annoying speaking manner, and uses silly analogies (i.e. clapping your feet like a little seal). This video is too short and too cutsie for someone who is serious about exercise."
3,It's ok but...,"I think the quality of the video is just OK or adequate, not excellent. Also, the workout itself is very, very short with long and somewhat too lengthy explanations between exercises which makes it lose its flow. I have lost interest in this DVD very quickly."
5,Pilates - Mat Based Workout for Beginners VHS,"I love this workout. When I put it in the VCR I thought well, I'll just watch first, (that's my basic cop out with all exercies videos)! However, because of the way Ana Caban gives you all the information that you need to start this workout, ""before she actually goes into it"" I was hooked and started right away.Before I knew it my workout was over, time was up, and I was still wanting ""more""! Actually I was shocked that my workout was ""over"" finished!As soon as I have the moves in this workout smooth and under control, I'm going to start adding her Intermeidate Workout as well. I loved it!Starting with a basic workout that ""can"" be done easily is like a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend this for everyone on a daily basis! Another great thing about this work out is that is calming, while at the same time you can feel the benefits of your muscles working for you!Buy It!"
5,Great for Beginners!,"This video is fantastic! I really had no idea what was involved with Pilates, and this is a great introduction. I was very surprised how simple it is to go through. This is an encouraging video and leads to further interests in these exercises. I am glad I bought it!"
2,Not much of a workout,"I got the beginner tape which I thought was a good introduction to pilates, my main complaint is with the length of the tape which is misleadingly stated to be ""40 minutes"" - it is more like 15 minutes with another 25 of Ana rambling on - I have to do the tape twice and fast forward in certain parts to make sure I get some kind of workout!"
2,This is Hype!,"Why must we jazz everything up? They do not explain proper breathing or position of the spine. Ana Caban is sickeningly ""Cute."" The only good thing I can say about this video is that they DO follow traditional positions even though they DO NOT explain the proper execution of them."
3,A little too easy.,"I love Ana Caban but this workout was too easy! Although it is essential because she teaches you how to 'engage your core'. If you have any experience with dance or already have somewhat strong core muscles, I recomend her intermediate level."
3,Not bad...a little fast,"This video covers it all, but it goes very fast. It works best with a Pilates book, where you can underline the exercises and use the video to make sure you have correct form."
4,"Great Workout, at home","If you are the type of person that enjoys feeling great after a workout, but hate going to the gym- or attending crowded classes, then this is a good purchase for you. I feel stronger and leaner afterwards."
4,Good for a beginner like myself,"I just tried this DVD for the first time and really enjoyed it. Ana Caban is clear, concise, and not ""ditzy"" like other fitness instructors on other DVDs. My one complaint is that she goes a bit too fast during some of the actual exercises. However, she does have a model doing less advanced moves in the background--- which was really helpful. I generally found it easy to follow and an effective workout--- my abs are killing me right now!"
5,This is a top-notch pilates workout,"I agree with the other reviewers that this a a good quality pilates video for beginners. Ana Caban is an excellent instructor, providing good cuing and proper form. I also like the fact that there is a second person demonstrating a modified version of each of the exercises---which is great for those of us still developing our strength and flexibility. I think it is is important to point out, though, that pilates doesn't take the place of a cardio workout. It is a great compliment to your cardio and strength-training programs. I think it is inaccurate for anyone to say that pilates can substitute for aerobics or other cardio activities."
2,Not what I thought at the beginning!,"I got hooked into trying Pilates after seeing an infomercial for Winsor Pilates (I bought those tapes and am not thrilled with them either). I didn't realize how weak the tape was until I took some private sessions with a wonderful Pilates trainer. There is so much more to the exercises than Ana describes. Even for a beginner, it is important to understand all of the components of the excercise to get the full benefit. I LOVE Pilates, but don't love this tape."
3,Fair to Middling,"It gets old fast. I'm not in outstanding shape, but it wasn't a challenge for long. I think if you're interested it might be better to get a used copy and save a few bucks."
2,Likable but poor filming.,"While Ana Caban is fun to follow, the filming in this video is definitely geared toward Generation X'ers. If you are not a fan of five-second scene changes, switching back and forth from black and white to color, and odd screen angles you should try a different video. My own personal favorite, a shot that begins as if your nose is against a pillar in the room, then slowly panning out to the instructor. To bad because Ms. Caban is very likable."
2,Thumbs DOWN,"This video is totally over-rated! I was relying on the LivingArts brand and it really let me down. I recommend you carefully read some of the critical reviews on this video because after buying it I AGREE-- both on instruction and quality.Now that I've been burned I see there are many other titles and instructors out there. I'm going to try Kathy Smith's Pilates video and Pilates for Dummies. I've especially read some great things about Michelle Dozois, the instructor for Pilates for Dummies and since I began Pilates a few months ago have read some awesome reviews on this video in several fitness magazines."
1,Seller does not respond,"I must have inadvertently ordered the VHS instead of a DVD. When I sent the seller a message about this, they never got back to me. Now I'm stuck with it."
1,Not impressed,"Agree with other reviewers - instructor is much more concerned about her appearance on the video than showing proper technique. I bought this because I thought it would be a good ""beginner video"" and emphasize the correct postures. The tape is too choppy and hard to get a good look at correct movements. Am now looking for another video."
1,Ouch!! Lower back problems!!,"I did this video once and experienced horrible lower back pain that had me out of work and laying on a heating pad for almost 2 full days!! I would like to point out I am a dancer and have experience with pilates and yoga as well, I am not an inexperienced exerciser or out of shape. I have other pilates videos that are way better than this like 10 minute solutions pilates perfect body which is challenging but doesn't put the user at risk of back injury like this one does. This is not a beginners workout, its the worst workout video I own and I am putting it in the trash where it belongs. I would give it zero stars if I could!!"
5,Great Video!,My roommate owned this video on VHS in college and I loved doing the routine. Ana Caban is a great instructor and the video moves at a good pace. I'm so excited to have it in DVD now.
1,"Too much attitude, not enough good instruction","If you like MTV, you'll like the quick, artsy cuts of this video production. Otherwise, it will drive you up the wall. This type of production is not good for an exercise video; especially Pilates, which requires even more concentration.Ana is obviously very ""into"" herself and has a patronizing attitude toward the viewer. Her assistant, ""Morticia,"" follows along diligently. Modifications are demonstrated from time to time but are not consistent or well thought out for the beginner.I am amazed that Living Arts put their label on this video."
3,Is My DVD Player Broken??,"I am new to pilates and am in the process of trying several beginner workouts. This one is excellent in that Ana Caban carefully explains each move and goes slowly enough that a beginner can watch and learn. Ana is an excellent instructor and very down-to-earth in her approach. HOWEVER, the production on this DVD is the absolute worst I have ever seen: I actually thought my DVD player was malfunctioning!! The picture changes from black and white to color and everything in between. The camera bounces up and down and loses clarity on close up shots. An otherwise beautiful set and workout is nearly ruined by such ameteurish camera work. Shame on Giam!"
1,"Different Pilates instructor than advertised on site, cover, and DVD","I received this DVD and discovered to my surprise that instead of 60 minutes of Pilates instruction from Ana Caban, there was 40 minutes of Pilates instruction from Jillian Hessel. The cover and even the DVD graphic art show Ana, but the content of the actual DVD is different from advertised. I like Jillian Hessel's instruction so will not return the DVD but I'm not happy that the contents were so different than advertised. From looking at other reviews, it appears that I am not the only one who has received a DVD with Jillian."
1,wrong item,"This DVD is supposed to be Beginning Pilates instruction by Ana Caban as advertised but instead what was on the DVD was Fundamental Pilates by Jillian Hessel. The package and the DVD label both showed Ana Caban as pictured, but what was on the DVD was Hessel and another person. I would give it zero stars if allowed. I will return it."
1,Too much talking,"I purchased this tape after taking a Pilates class so I could work out at home - very disappointing. Ana Caban does a good job with the introduction, but the exercises are done too quickly and it's very hard to get the proper form. Ana also spends too much time talking and trying to act cute when explaining the exercises and you spend more time listening than actually doing the moves. I bought the Brooke Siler book and I find it much more worthwhile and the exercises are explained much better."
1,Give it up!,"First, the workout... if you workout at all this is not a challenge. The principles of pilates are sound however this routine doesn't provide enough for a thorough workout. It's best suited for those that are new to exercise. In fact I would recommend yoga if all you are looking for is exercise to strengthen, tone, and lengthen-- yoga has much more depth and whole body approach.Now, the instructor. Please get over yourself... ""perky buns like hers""? Get real! Focus on the instruction.Go for a different video-- like Jennifer Kreis or just go to the gym."
2,Great workout but I received a defective DVD,"I bought this DVD once, loved it because I could space my workout....on a lazy day, I do only the bonus routine. The workout is a great andquick way to keep your abdomen flat. I gave it to a friend andbought another. It was a defective DVD that wouldn't allow me toadvance from one program to next. I can only fast forward, providingI stop before the end of one program and let it play forward on its own tothe next program, otherwaise I end up at the introduction again.Are all the new DVD's like that?"
2,Product was OK--a little boring,"The product was ok. However, I had a HUGE problem with Amazon. First, your website does not give a confirmation page to proof before you submit your order. When I got the email confirmation a few minutes later, it showed I ordered 2 DVD's instead of 1! I immediately phoned a representative at Amazon because the website would not let me make a change to my order because the website said it was already ""processing"". This was within minutes of placing my order. A nice lady I spoke to on the phone said she canceled the entire order for me. But then, about a week later, I received ""2"" DVD's! I went to the return page to return the extra DVD, but it said I could only replace the extra DVD with the same item, not return it. So now I have received and paid for 2 DVD's when I only ordered one! I will never do business with Amazon again! I'm sure this review will never be posted."
4,This is a great beginner tape,"There are so many pilates tapes on the market, it's tough decide on just one. So, after reading the reviews, I picked this tape. It's a great beginner tape. But, if you work out regularly, this tape will be too easy. I work out regularly at a gym 3-4 days a week and I didn't break a sweat.This tape was excellent teaching proper breathing and positioning. And, the music was great. Some workout videos have terrible music. That is not the case with this video.So, I think if you are new to pilates, this video would be a great addition to your video library. But, if you are looking for a sweat drenching workout, this is not the tape for you."
4,Pilates at Home,This DVD provides a good review of pilates at home after experience taking classes in a studio. It is pleasent and gives good verbal reminders. It is a good DVD for me because I have injuries and need other exercise options.
3,Tough but doable,"This is a tough work-out that will leave you perspiring. I would not consider some of the exercises for beginners, such as the corkscrew, but overall this is a good workout and accessible for anyone in reasonably good shape. Also, the more you do pilates, the easier it becomes as you develop core strength. I don't give this workout 4 or 5 stars because some of the essential back strengthening exercises, such as swimming, rising swan etc., are missing. Also, I think the breathing cues are reversed on some exercises with Caban telling you to inhale when you should be exhaling. I also take issue with the her lack of emphasis on starting the curve in your lumbar spine in spine-stretch forward. But as I said, it is overall a good workout and I like Caban's cues and emphasis on form better than many others."
4,A Nice Balance Between Intro and Beginner's Workout,"This is a great intro for the uninitiated. Used as a companion to Siler's ""The Pilates Body"", you will have a nice, all-around beginner's workout. Caban moves quickly through the poses, so the book is a good idea if you want to spend more time understanding exactly what is going on.The bonus is that one of Caban's students accompanies her to exhibit a simplified version of the workout. I switch back and forth between both versions, depending on the pose. The workout is short, approx. 30 minutes, because it only covers the core of Pilates method. These poses will carry on throughout, from beginning to advanced, so it is important to understand these well.I will definitely be doing this everyday for 3 more weeks, then I will move on up to the intermediate tape."
2,Boring and Annoying,This is the first video I purchased for Pilates and I was very disappointed. The instructor is very annoying and talks down to us as if she is talking to small children. She was informative though on the proper techniques for body position and breathing. I have since purchased another Pilates video which I like much better. The workout itself consists of 20 minutes of mostly ab and some leg work. I found the workout to be very easy even at my beginner level. The main reason I purchased this tape was for the stretching which I need as I exercise 6 days a week. I just can't deal with this irritating instructor. I'm giving this tape away.
4,Great video,"Great video and work out! Ana is very detailed and describes every move with great detail. She also has a small intro teaching you common words in Pilates. I wish the work out was a little longer though, but that is why I bought several of her videos."
4,"Skip Beginners, Buy the Intermediate","The Beginners workout is very short, and at the end, the instructor tells you to ""buy the intermediate tape."" Many of the basic exercises are omitted. Anyone who has taken Pilates class and has even basic familiarity should skip the Beginner tape and buy the Intermediate. Even if it is a little harder, you can grow into it. Only a true beginner should go with the Beginner tape."
5,Great Chocolate Molds,Easy and fun to use. I enjoy purchasing from this supplier because of the variety and consideration he takes with his customers. This mold was perfect for winter weather celebrations.
2,The Real Guide,"Unfortunately this is not the book it is supposed to be. You are much better off with the more thorough, more useful older edition. This edition has none of the helpful information of its predecessor, and although prices are not current in the old version, the information is relevant. This is a simple, safe review of a long list of aircraft. It lacks the truth and some basic information a buyer needs - # built, versions built, NTSB safety records, thorough information on mods., useful owner comments, and much more. The Cost/Performance/Specs. sections are useless. I am truly disappointed. It's only plus is that it has more aircraft that the older edition - but more of something that does not help me still does not help me. Shame on Aviation Consumer for producing such a poor product after setting the standard with is older edition."
3,Fluff,"Perhaps it is because criminology has yet to mature and struggles to present itself as a science, but this book, like many others in the social sciences, spends many pages to articulate even the most simple concepts. Honestly, it could've been condensed to perhaps half its size, removing all the unnecessary repetitions and useless filler text."
3,No Table of Contents nor page numbers,"This is a required text in my course. However, I am clueless why my Kindle edition does not contain a table of contents! Also, we utilize APA Formatting in all our professional writing. Citing material from this text is therefor problematic as there is no ability to cite specific page numbers. I am reading the text on an iPad 2, which works fine. I am only rating the kindle edition three stars, because there is a one star deduct for the lack of a table of contents, and a one star deduct for the inability to discern page numbers."
4,Good,"This textbook provides a good review of criminological theories. It can be a little wordy at times, but still a great book. I am planning on keeping it for future reference."
1,Very Weak,"This was a big disapointment. Dorcy makes a dog gone good flash light, but this one is very weak. Don't let the size fool you they havea better light from some of their other flash lights that are half the size for the same money. This one is for those who don't haveanything to compare it too. Not worth the money."
4,Excellent bargin for a great drive,"This CD-RW rocks. It only took 8 minutes to burn 400 megs onto a CD-R. Comes with the Adaptec software that everyone has, plus Plextors own stuff. One negative was the Plextor software did not recongnize my other CD-ROM. I downloaded an update and everything was fine. Plextor makes good CD players. One of the best."
2,Disappointed,"Plextor has an excellent reputation for making quality CD drives. This model is their first IDE unit. I was unfortunate to receive a defective model. First clue was an occasional soft grinding sound when inserting a CD. Another significant symptom is that several times now, the unit locks up completely while trying to erase a CDRW, had to reboot to even eject CD. Also discovered this unit will not run under Easy CD Creator 4.02 nor 4.02c. It will run under 4.01. Not sure if this is just my defective unit or if problem is systemic. After launching 4.02, CD read speed drops to less than 1X, must close 4.02 and reboot to restore normal CDROM operations. Have already upgraded to Plextor firmware 1.07, but also had same problems with 1.05. All problems existed with Win98 SE, Win2000, and Win Me."
1,Not worth the hassle,"I bought this cd-rw, had to have it professionally installed due to not understanding jumpers and slaves, which cost me $40 extra and found out it was a DUD. It never worked for me, I took it back 3 times to the tech who installed it, and they told me to send it back. The Adaptec software however was set up very simple. I wouldn't suggest this to someone who has never installed anything or someone who doesn't want the hassle."
3,NOT A REAL REVIEW-JUST A QUESTION!,"Sorry, I figured any message board I would go to would never respond so I am going to try this. My question to everyone out there who has one of these is does the software come with something where you can create some sort of label or just a cover or print off a list to slip into the jewel case??? please get back to me if you can answer my questions! silverrose625@hotmail.com"
5,A Beauty!,"I'll save you the ""techno-jargon"" as to why this drive is a must above the others primarily, because when it comes to installing hardware, I profess to be a rookie (i.e. one who doesn't know the difference between a jumper switch and jumping rope). Herin lies the ease with Plextor -- EVERYTHING is laid out for you save an expedition I had to make for an audio cable. I use this (now) to burn voice demo tapes (check out TCROW.com for samples)and had my first one done just an hour after UPS made delivery. 'Nuff said!"
5,Everything you need and more!...,"This is a great product for the price. It works better than I thought it could. It even has a label maker in the soft ware, except you have to type in the name of the songs and artist. No big deal. I never up graded the label maker. The only problem I had was with the jumper, the directions said to make the Plex Writer the master. I have a Dell computer and Dell said to make the Plex Writer the slave which worked out fine."
5,I loved all 4 of the products,The Hydrating Skin Therapy is so good for my dry skin. I have a lot of allergies and I'm not allergic to any of these 4 products. The Skin Calming Cream is great for insect bites and rashes. It takes away the itching and swelling.The Foot Therapy Cream is great for my dry feet. I have diabetes and this product give moisture to my feet so they are not chapped and dry. The Callus Therapy softens the callus on my feet.This is a great way to try these 4 products and see how you like it. I'm now going to order the larger sizes. Also good for traveling. I did not have any problems with the containers that the product came in. Great products.
4,poetry may be for everybody,"so i would never consider myself to be interested at all in poetry, and its incredibly odd how i came across this book. i wound up buying, and i actually forgot about it until it came in the mail. I must say that I was very drawn into these poems. I take back every negative thing I have ever said about poetry. If there are any other skeptics out there, I say try this book out, it will suprise you."
4,Rancher Makes Runaway His Bride,Interesting storyline typical Joan Johnston style. Would have liked for it to have included previous family characters more in the story.
3,both stories too short,"I enjoyed the plots of both stories, but the stories were too short. It would have been nice to have two separate books with more detailed information and longer stories. Just as you are really getting into the book, it is over."
2,Bad Logic at ending,"Good book except for the ending. Judy Troy does a good job with the writing, reality of South Dakota, locatons, emotions, etc. The ending makes little sense-if Law enforcement knew enough to have Inez (undercover agent) be Glenn's companion during his contact with Mike, why did they not just pick him up? Sometimes poor logic really ruins a book and it did in this case."
1,Inaccurate,"Upon completing my read of this nove, I must say that Judy Troy could have set this story in any location in the country. Her research, or lack thereof, into the phyche of South Dakotans is deeply flawed. Her characters are one-dimensional, the stoic mother, the depressed and useless father, the semi-horny teenage boy, the once pregnant teenage girlfriend, and the unprofessional cop. She didn't even get the language of South Dakotans correct. For anyone who is considering reading this novel or has read it, please do not think this is a portrait of South Dakota. She has taken the easy route of using stereotypical images for her characters. She might as well have included a war-painted Indian, excuse me, Native American wearing a loin cloth worshiping at Bear Butte."
5,Appealing Book,"Love the simple, yet vital message of this book. Not much is more important as a parent than taking care of yourself, inside and out....and being present, happy and emotionally healthy for your child. I find as a mom in her 40s with a young child, this is especially true since there are different challenges you face when 35+.Really liked the featured quotes in the book and the approachable format. Perfect for the mom on the go.Robin[...]"
5,At Last!,"Bria Simpson wrote the book I've been searching for! It's a quick read for busy moms but the material is a ""must read"". It really helped to put my priorities and values in perspective."
5,A fantastic and useful book for busy moms!,"As an nanny, I continuously hear all types of moms discuss the issues they face raising their children today. These issues have been depicted in The Balanced Mom, but more importantly the author offers useful and realistic ways to address those issues and work toward a healthy balance between yourself/mom/partner. Moms in Atlanta are already buying this book and raving. I have even benefited from this book (no children yet) and am working on a greater ""balance"" in my personal life. I will definitely read it again when I have children. You will not be disappointed."
4,Great read for new mother,"Some of this book is definitely geared toward more seasoned moms with older/multiple children. But, I thoroughly enjoyed it as a first time mom. I read it when my baby was a few months old, and really appreciated the short yet meaningful chapters. If you can only find maybe 10-15 mins to read each day, this is a great book for you! I'm looking forward to reading it again when I have more time."
4,I'm passing this around to all my mama friends!,"I really enjoyed this book - much of it is common sense but the author has a way of saying things that motivates you to do the things you know you need to do. I think the most valuable point she makes is about prioritizing spending money on babysitters so you get alone time or date nights. Almost every parent I know feels guilty about doing this and always say they can't afford it. She makes the point to look at where you spend your money and ask the question - does it truly reflect what you value? In other words, most of us won't think twice about spending it on clothes or on another activity for our children but won't spent it on untangible things like babysitting help.The only reason it didn't get 4 stars is because the bulleted lists got a little irritating after awhile. I understand she was making it easy to read and to the point for busy moms but I still felt like it could have been written in prose style."
5,Offers a powerful common sense viewpoint,"Love's Learning Place: Truth as Aphrodisiac in Women's Long-Term Relationships by spiritual and psychological women's counselor Renate Stendhal, is a human sexuality self-help guide for lesbian women in long-term relationships. Focusing on openness and truth as the key to keeping sexual desire alive, and enhanced with anecdotes from lesbian couples, Love's Learning Place focuses on the simple yet profound idea that communication matters, and takes the lead in debunking pervasive myths - such as the idea that one should ""just know"" what feels good in sex, or that sex should come automatically and instinctively. Although written especially for women in lesbian relationships, Love's Learning Place offers a powerful common sense viewpoint applicable to all long-term sexual partnerships."
4,Good book for kids who like to stretch the truth,"This book is a great one for my now 7-year old. He's in the denial stage when he does something wrong, and we read it the other night. It's a funny look at the different types of lies, why people lie, and why it's best not to lie. Great teaching book for kids (and adults, too)."
4,Heartfelt Story,"This is a wonderful story, that in my opinion, isn't meant as a ""guide"" to parenting or adoption, however it is a look into how rewarding adoption can be. For those unable to have biological children, this book proves that the happiness and joy of having a family can be acheived. My hats off to this fine couple who provided a loving and happy home to their children and perhaps given hope to many."
5,Great Bratz!,"This lil bratz is my fave.It comes with a cool doll,motor bike,shoes,a brush,make-up,cellphone,soda,sunblock,and a towel with her name on it.Plus,the back-seat can be removed to turn into a beach chair.It's very fun to play with.Buy it!"
2,Tips over,This item was poorly made. It constantly tips over and will not sit on its own. What a bummer! I would not recommend this unless they change the design.
4,Excellent look inside mind and heart of Bono,"A pleasant surprise. I was afraid this book-length interview would turn into a self-congratulatory rambling session with a sycophantic journalist. However, Assayas keeps after Bono with tough and interesting questions and Bono is - by and large - candid and frequently quite insightful. He holds back on some things, which is his perogative, and can get on tangents about his greatest passion of the moment (Africa) but ultimately I found him an honest, fascinating, intelligent, and admirable fellow. I couldn't put it down.Especially refreshing (and amusing) is the chapter devoted to Bono's theology (""Add Eternity to That""). He has a penchant for dropping swear words into the discussion and that may be off-putting to some Christians. He clearly points to Christ's sacrifice on the cross and God's grace as his only hope of salvation but avoids the cliches evangelicals often fall back on. You don't hear that from too many rock stars."
3,Just......okay......,"When I first received this item, I was dissapointed, it was small(about an inch) and looked cheapy cheapy. The silver was really thin and it had bent slightly during shipping. I had bought it as a present for my wife, and she actually loved it because it was so unique. So, credit where credit is due, ""it's unique,"" although it's not the greatest quality and kinda britle looking."
2,Body Art,The guys have no idea how to dance and they keep doing the same moves over and over. It's a good time and you can't take your eyes off of it but only because it's funny. Not Art! Not Sexy!
4,Impresionante,Higgins entrega todo como siempre. No vas a querer terminarlo. Te tiene en vilo hasta el final.
4,Thrilling,Jack Higgings always delivers. The book keeps your attention and surprises you. You won't want to finish it.
4,Guide to Weight Training/ Squash & Racquet ball,"it was good reading And guides to better training, Gave me a lot of information I really would love to have a D.V.D with the excercises. Good job doneRegardsYasmin"
1,Not impressed,"Did not care for this book. It appeared to contain only 2 pages that pertained to racquetball training, the rest of the content was cut and paste from another book. I found much better training information for free with a Google search."
2,Out of sync.,"Ella is wonderful, of course. However the audio and video on this DVD are not synchronized properly which makes it difficult to watch. Might as well just listen to the LP or CD of this concert which have been out for years."
5,Extremely Comfortable shoes,I love these shoes! They are for C-D width feet and feel like you're wearing slippers. Awesome!
5,Great shoes,"I bought these shoes after my feet started to swell due to congestive heart failure. I couldn't even get my other shoes on, but these stretched nicely and accommodated my feet and ankles even as the day progressed. The foot bed reminds me a little of Birkenstocks, so good arch support in a casual and comfy shoe. It looks great with a pair of jeans too."
5,Resurrection: The Blessed Hope,"I have read this book years ago and it's a great resource for Christians to have. As Hank is great at doing, writing to the new believers in Christ, in a easy and cogent way. This book is a great book on one of the best historical event in history. The resurrection is the hope of every believer and we should be able to defend it and know what are hope is.Good Job"
4,Part of a trinity of books,"Haven't read it yet. I have just finished ""Has God Spoken"" and it is a powerful answer to Biblical skeptics and to those who deliberately cast doubt on the accuracy of the Bible. Skeptics cast doubt on the resurrection and I want a powerful answer to counter the skeptics."
2,unstable firmware,"Out of the box, the unit I got kept locking up and rebooting. Very unstable. Delorme suggested I upgrade to firmware 1.3, but the unit was already at that level so N/A. Unuseable."
2,You're on your own,"The much-hyped ability to display USGS topos and aerial photography is fine in theory, but after wasting 6 hours I still have not found out how to transfer downloaded files from computer to the PN-20 either in the manual or online. Not having the USGS maps is a serious problem, because the Delorme maps for areas I am interested in are inaccurate."
2,not worth the money,"I bought this GPS for a family camping trip to north Florida. I rarely obtain satelites to get a position, and what made it worse, was the fact my $50 cheaper MIO car gps obtained satelites constantly. I had to use a map and compass to find our way back to camp, because it was unable to obtain satelite position during our hike. I would not recomend this product. it was a waste of money."
4,Delorme PN-20,"I bought the unit mainly for geocaching. Have been using it for about a month and it works great. Signal strength is good even in heavy cover, it puts me right on the coords, has ample internal memory + SD card, and it transfers info [...] with no problems. The two complaints I have are the short battery life( I now use rechargables ) and the software is complicated to me ( I ain't to smart ) When you compare the features and price it's hard to beat."
3,Good beginning but had a way to go.,"If you want user friendly with rapid sat. reception get a garmin 60csx as i have one. however if you can deal with frustration hours of trying to figure out the directions and loading in all the maps and downloaded photos and actually get it to work you have a great device that does a good job showing your location superimposed over a map or an areal photo. not bad for foresty, perhaps seach and rescue however its slow. just have a few drinks ready when you plan to get the downloads and get the external memory chip and READER. to slow when using usb cable.cheers"
2,Not up to industry standards,"I've had a PN-20 for more than 3 years and have found it to be difficult to use. It is non-intuitive and if not in constant use very difficult to go beyond simple tracking. I haven't used it for a year and all the city detail is missing. I reset the unit to factory settings; lost all my difficult to enter data, and had the detail until I tried to shift to another city and all the detail disappeared. Nothing below 8 mile resolution. Over the years I've gone to Mac computers and now can't reload my SW and I'm stuck with an expensive yellow brick."
2,Slow screen update and poor accuracy,"I was very excited about this GPS; with its long list of features, included software, and low price, it seemed like a no-brainer as the economy hiking GPS of choice. Unfortunately, what could be a great product is hampered by two problems:Poor Accuracy: This GPS takes a LONG time (on the order of a minute or two) to obtain a satellite lock, and the smallest margin of error it gave me was 36 feet. My similarly priced Garmin Edge bike computer (which clearly doesn't have any larger an antenna) obtains a lock in 15 seconds or less and is usually accurate to 10 to 14 feet.Slow Screen Update: The screen re-draws VERY slowly. In my opinion, the screen updates too slowly to make the color display and numerous display features worth it.The included mapping software is nice, although the online map/imagery purchasing is a little awkward."
4,Great GPS for the money,I have used Delorme software and laptop GPS for the last several years and found their software superior to Garmins. I like the flexibility of being able to update the maps myself with my own data. Not to mention you get more for the money with Delorme than Garmin. The 60csx is an excellent GPS but has been just out of my price range and the PN20 is more than comparrable.
4,Sweet deal,"Bought this to use while geocaching. I've found a couple with it and it works great. The software that comes with it is awesome, that is what made me get this one instead of a Garmin since I'd have to buy the software also.There's a firmware update coming out sometime that will make true paperless caching available on the PN-20. The only thing that isn't great is the turn by turn. There just isn't enough power to re-calculate a route. But overall, this is an awesome deal."
5,A really great GPS unit,"I bought this unit to use outdoors because I have been a big fan of their paper Atlas for more than a decade and more recently of their software. This GPS unit is a real gem! Extremely rugged, water proof (it even floats in case you ever take it with you fishing). Initially, I had planned on only using it recreationally, but I have Delorme's XMap software for work and discovered that I could scan our company system maps and download those onto the PN-20, too.I do however wish that the screen was a little bigger, sometimes it is a little difficult to see the small screen."
3,Earthmate GPS,My Earthmate GPS works great. The only thing I would change is the USB plug on the devise. It sometimes fails to make good contact and needs to be cleaned befor connection. I also would like to have control over the device odometer so I can match it up with the actual miles I have on my bike.
3,meant for hikers,"I have been very happy with the Delorme products on my laptop. I have also been quite unhappy with other GPS devices like Garmin and TomTom, so I decided to try the PN-20. This is for use in a vehicle and the display on the PN-20 is too small for use in a vehicle. I have returned the PN-20 and will continue using my laptop."
1,junk,"Very slow processor, locks up just when you need it. Cannot multi-task. It's a ""One Trick Pony"". Also a battery hog. Don't buy it."
4,Wood Turning,I received the book in a timely fashion and it was as advertised. I am enjoying the book
4,"Quality, USEFUL iPod Dock...",I bought an iPod dock when I got my 30 GB iPod Video. It was the base one from the Apple store. Of course it worked fine and look great next to my new iMac 20 Core 2 Duo. But as my desk looked so great and clean with my dual 20 inch monitors and iPod I needed a card reader. So I looked in the latest issue of MacWorld and found a photo of the IDuo Dock. It is a iPod dock just like the base Apple one plus it has a built in card reader! The ony downside it your have to use 2 USB ports. One for the reader and one of the iPod connection. Don't get me wrong they are right next to each other on the back on the unit but you have to connect both. That made using my iMac's USB ports tough. But still a good product.
5,Fantastic!!,"I just happened to stumble across this cd one day and decided to give it a listen. Well lets just say that I this album will not be leaving my rotation anytime soon. It is absolutely fantastic! The performances are totally flawless, but what else would you expect from members of the National Symphony Orchestra? This album is a must have for those who enjoy Double Bass music!"
5,Excellent...,"Charlemagne is something of an enigma. It is necessary to separate legend from fact. Russell Chamberlin deserves high praise for doing so in a manner both straightforward and stirring. Establishing the ascendancy of the Carolingian dynasty, Chamberlin moves forward to plot the manner by which Charlemagne expanded his inheritance to eventually become Imperator Romanus to the dismay of his rivals in Constantinople.It is a compelling story. From a provincial backwater, Charlemagne became sovereign of Western Europe to include the Holy See and the remnants of Roman greatness. Popes crossed the Alps to call and alliances were struck with rulers in places as far to the east as Baghdad. Chamberlin ensures that the reader extracts full enjoyment from this extraordinary tale. His Charlemagne is a fast-paced interpretation of remarkable clarity and unconditionally deserves 5 stars. It is one of the better historical biographies I've had the pleasure to read."
4,A good read! Funny and bizarre...,"I understand this is the author's first novel. This book is very entertaining and enlightening. It was funny, poignant, and gave me (being a woman) insight into the mind of a man in the midst of a crisis.I really enjoyed some of the main character's quirks and sarcastic observations of the people around him.I would recommend this book highly and am looking forward to the next one by this new talented author."
3,fast fred,The float extension was subject to loosening leading to float loss in the fuel tank and required redesign to remove this deficiency.
2,Damn the details!,"Product arrived and I went with the suggestion from Amazon to add the gasket. If it comes with a gasket why suggest it Amazon? As others stated, a gasket comes with it though no where does it mention all the hardware is included nor does the pic show a gasket. Also, the instruction were poorly printed to the point where words were blurred and unreadable. Also the instruction say nothing about needing a drill or what size bit to use. There is also extra hardware that I have no idea where to use it since the instruction were so poorly thought out. Also, it mentions using it for diesel with a return then provides no information. I hope the sender works better than my current experience. Does it really take that much effort for Moeller to get it right?"
2,Not accurate,The supplied instructions weren't legible. I was able to download it from the manufactures web site. After installation it didn't ready accurate. It was about an 1/8 of a tank low. Will just use as is.
2,It works,It works. Be gentle with it when installing. It is nothing fancy. Probably paid too much. I supose it is a good cheap fix.
1,Gold Tip? NOT.,"WOW!I must start off by saying the FIRST time I shot one from point blank range (1 foot) to try out my new ""really good"" arrows, the arrowhead came OFF. Not to mention the nock stuck to my bowstring whilst the arrow did not. I shot another one outside. Bounced off the target and didn't even penetrate in the slightest. And then the nock snapped clean in half by hitting SOIL.Do not buy these, I can't believe this company made a joke item like this at all!"
1,same book different cover,"This is the same book with the title ""How to prepare for the SAT 9 2nd grade"" by the same publisher. So if you have the book, don't buy this one. The content of this book is mediocore."
2,Should have shipped in a box!,"I hate having good books arrive with corners crunched up due to poor packing.The price was good, and it would have been a good value if it had been shipped in a box."
1,This Bicycle is Complete Garbage,"What a disappointment!!! We bought this for my 4 year old son for a Christmas present. He asked Santa for it several times and was so excited that it was a ""John Deere"" themed bike as he loves his grandpa's John Deere tractor. Thank God we tried to put it together before the holiday or else we would have had one very sad little boy on our hands on Christmas morning. The forks the hold the front tire onto the bike do not align at all, making it IMPOSSIBLE to get the front tire onto the bike. Aside from this major manufacturer defect, there also are no assembly instructions included with the bicycle. All in all, this product is very cheaply made. Now, not only do we have to buy our son a new bike someplace else, but we have to explain to him why Santa couldn't deliver the ""John Deere"" bike that he asked him for. Thanks Learning Curve."
1,Bicycle fork not welded correctly,"Similar to another reviewer, I had a problem with the fork not being welded correctly. Not only were the fork ends slightly curved inward, but one was about a half inch longer than the other. Needless to say, the front wheel could not be attached correctly."
1,do not recommend,"I was unhappy with this purchase, most bikes for young children have a rear & front caliper brakes, this product does not. I was told I was required to pay return shipping. Very disappointed, I am used to much better service from Amazon."
1,I have a better book to reccomend,"100 Q&A; About Endometriosis (100 Questions & Answers)I was diagnosis with endo 3 years ago and I have to say that David B. Redwines book is the only book on endo worth getting. It gives you the real answers, not the ones that unresearched physicians and pharmaceutical companies want to give you.Heres the name of the book: 100 Q&A; About Endometriosis by David B. RedwineBefore you even consider doing something about your endo read this book. It saved my life."
2,Depressing.,"This is one of the most depressing books about Endometriosis I have ever read. It does contain a lot of information on potential treatments for the disease, but the running theme in the book is that nobody understands endo, little works to cure endo, and there is a wonderful chance that it will come back."
3,Not What I Had in Mind,"I agree with the reviewers who mention the ""company line"" behind this book. I personally was looking for something that would help me figure out what to do on a personal level to assist my body in fighting endo, but this was more of a conventional medicine read, and hard to get through at that. I recommend ""Endometriosis - A Key to Healing with Nutrition"", if this is what you're looking for. Did enjoy the cartoons, though!"
5,This is the best book for learning about endometriosis.,After learning that I had endometriosis I began a search for more information of the subject. I found this book by means of Amazon and am thankful that I did. It is the most informative of all books that I have read on endometriosis.
1,Too Technical/impersonal- can't relate to anything,I was disappointed to read this book and didn't even finish it because it was so impersonal and techinical. There is nothing redeeming about this book unless you're a physician who understands all the jargon. I am looking for a more *human* book that can help me on a more personal level - any suggestions?
3,stick with small format,"It does what it's designed to do, but put hands on it if you can before buying.There is a lot of wiggle on the flash-head, but that's standard across most brackets in this class. Here's what to watch out for before buying:1) Notice the bracket extends forward from the bottom of the camera - if you usually hold your barrel from below, you will need to be ready to change that.2) In deference to the above reviews - the height of the flash mount does adjust in the vertical plane. You can adjust it via philips screws to rest above your sensors and such. It DOES NOT adjust in the horizontal plane. If you use large lenses, you may have clearance issues (it rests directly against the focus ring of an EF 85 1.2)"
2,A little too small,"This product was recommended to me by an online photo store. I was excited to get it an try it out but the top of the bracket blocked my sc-29 sensor. If the distance between the bottom of the bracket to the top was 1/2"" more it would have worked perfectly. This will be heading back for another bracket.Anyone looking for a bracket for a D70S with an SB-800 and SC-29 make sure to get a larger bracket.I'm sure I would have rated it higher had it fit properly."
1,Caveat Emptor,"Caveat Emptor! To start, the title of this video is very deceptive and should be renamed from the ""Art of Seduction"" to the ""Art of Sedation"". My wife and I nearly fell asleep while watching this video. Our intention of purchasing this video was to enhance our relationship; however, there was no value or benefits gained. The length of the video is approximately 60 minutes; the content was centered on conversations among a group of low self-esteem women, no action. We believe that this video is extremely rudimentary, poor quality, and the ""so called"" instructions/advice was very useless. Moreover, the background music was cheesy and the characters portrayed were very unattractive. Lastly, our advice for everyone....please do not waste your time and money. In lieu of, you will have more enjoyment in hitting a bucket of golf balls. No academy awards for this video and two thumbs down!"
1,Do Not Buy This DVD,"I bought this DVD based on Eden's review. This DVD is, sadly, really bad. I wish I could get my money back. The information is so basic and badly explained. The production value is also just amateurish. I was really looking for a serious DVD that would break down Shimmies and this is just presentational - and badly at that. I'm surprised that a professional organization such as IAMED would produce something so useless. Sorry. I hate to be harsh, but I want my money back. Please don't waste yours."
2,THe level of practice is very basic,"I was disappointed... Even though its a good reminder of the variety however if you are intermediate/advanced dancer, there is notihing new for you there... I found the practice not chanllenging.."
5,Really like it,"Just what I need. So much to learn from! The instructor has a great smile and really very good at what she is doing. I like the tempo and the way she keeps going back to re-teach, and then adding variations.It is worth the high price.Just one thing that can be improved. When she speaks, it is in a much lower voice so I have to turn up the volume. When she dances, her voice becomes lounder, so is the drum; so I have to turn down the volume again. So all the time I keep doing this act. Having said that, I would not allow this small hiccup to deter anyone from buying it because we can learn an awfully lot from this DVD. It is not for drill, my preference, but rather, for teaching different shimmies."
5,Worth Every Penny!,"This was one of the most expensive instructional bellydance DVDs that I have purchased. However, I can honestly say that it was worth every penny. In fact, I got MORE than my money's worth! While I don't believe that a DVD can replace the ""dance studio"" experience, I do feel that anyone interested in learning or refining their shimmy would definitely benefit greatly from the information on this DVD."
1,misleading and poor value for the $$,"The ads for any of these volumes are misleading. They are listed as Volume # and the year with it. I was expecting the entire season's shows for that year, not 2 shows only. I'm not sure why a DVD with two shows on it would be listed as a VOLUME???The cost was outrageous for two shows! I'm really disapointed and definately won't be buying any more bogus ""Volume"" sets.The volume 7 was the lowest price and the Volumes 1 through 5 averaged around $112.The listing needs to be specific about the # of shows on the DVD- if they had been, I never would have purchased it- or maybe that was the plan in their marketing strategy- to mislead the customer."
3,Personna toolworx,the handle/ finger rings are too small and thir angle not good for left hand use.adjustable blade tension is good
2,Not as advertised. Beware of false left handed claims!,"These scissors seem to be good quality but they are not left handed as advertised. They obviously did not spend much time making there ad page. Amazon gave me a full refund in reasonable time, no harm no foul."
4,Wonderful tale with many shades of meaning,"The Devil's Mouth stands on two levels--as a beautifully-written tale set in medieval times, and as an allegory for the times we live in. Worth reading and taking to heart!"
5,Excellent story!,"I found this book at a thrift store and bought it for 90 cents because it sounded interesting. It was an awesome read and the best 90 cents I ever spent! I was engrossed in this book from the very beginning, and the characters were great! The review by publisher's weekly should be ignored because they obviously don't like the Christian perspective. But I think anyone who reads it could appreciate this book. I ordered the first book, ""The Crown of Eden"" because I wanted to read them in order. ""The Crown of Eden"" was a great read too but I liked this one better. I just bought the 3rd book called, ""The Bride of Stone,"" and I can't wait to read it!"
5,One of the only movies that really connected with me,"I remember watching this as an angry teen in the late 80's. Something about the tone just fit perfectly with how I was feeling. This story of two outcasts who just throw their hands in the air, one with a touch of hope, the other completely jaded captures something that I've never really felt in another movie.I've just rewatched this film on netflix for the first time in 20+ years and was shocked even more. As a teen the violence and attitude was just perfect. As an adult, it is disturbing and dark and funny and still... Connected with me on some level I thought was gone. Just a great piece of movie history. If my parents had wanted to know how I felt, I would have shown them this. No, I wouldn't have, but it would have been an honest response if I had."
4,VERY ENTERTAINING THRILLER,"TWO TEENAGERS [CHARLIE SHEEN AND MAXWELL CAULFIELD] DECIDE TO GO TO LA. ONCE THEY GET THERE, THEY COMMIT A SERIES OF RANDOM KILLINGS. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY UNDERRATED BY THE CRITICS. THIS IS A HIGHLY ENTERTAINING MOVIE. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT KEEPS YOU WATCHING. THIS IS ONE OF THE BETTER CHARLIE SHEEN MOVIES. BUY THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN! IT'S REALLY WORTH THE MONEY!"
5,Great Tribute--Wonderfully Performed,"This recording is just plain fun! Rachel Barton Pine is one of my favorite young violinists, and this may be my favorite of her albums! Not only is the music exceptionally well chosen, Mrs. Pine's performances are top-notch across the board. As usual, her technique is wonderful. And the musicality of the performances leaves nothing to be desired. Just listen to the sweetness of her playing in Amy Beach's Romance! I can listen to this one track over and over and not become bored. Then contrast the fiery virtuosity Pine exhibits in Bellstedt's Caprice on Dixie. Just wonderful! Let's just say this disc is going to remain in my CD player for a long time! Highly, highly recommended."
4,A Keeper!,"I've reread this book about a half a dozen times. The characters are interesting and likeable and the minimal love scenes are nicely done. I'd love to see a sequel to this book. All in all, a sweet little book.The book is about an Australian orphan girl, who has moved in with her aunt in a new town (after her parents are killed) and who quickly befriends the cute little blonde girl next door. As they grown older, the orphan girl grows to love her best friend but they are torn apart by society and circumstance. Years later, the orphan, who is now the town librarian, learns that her friend is getting divorced and coming back to town to visit her parents, with child in tow. More than half the book explores how the two women are reunited and whether they will admit they still love each other. Sweet little story."
2,Disappointing,"After reading excellent reviews on cnet, I expected a much better product. The editing software was lacking, and using the scanner did slow down my computer. What I found most annoying though was that it doesn't have an on/off switch. I know I could have unplugged it when not in use, but then turning it back on, the computer didn't acknowledge it, and then having to reboot slowed things down more. Finally, after about a year the scanning light burned out. I recently replaced it with the hp3180 all in one which was reasonably priced at amazon and came with the additional capabilities of printing and copying."
1,"Terrible software, no 800 support","The Copy Utility software does not work in WinXP. Apparently there is a conflict with the twain and twunk files that Windows uses. After 7+ hours...on my dime...with advanced tech support they gave up and said they can't do anything about the problem. The copy program is unusable and they said ""too bad"".They don't have an 800 number so you must pay to get their problems fixed.The Abby OCR program only works half the time. Many documents come out with gibberish on them. Poor program.Epson quality has definitely gone downhill. Will never buy another Epson product again."
2,Not ready for regular use...,"During the first week of use, the pad under the document cover came unglued and starting falling every time you opened the cover. Bundled software is adequate, but not a home run. Other than a setup poster, no hard copy documentation. Probably usable, but not for the scanning neophyte, and the suspect quality control evidenced by the self-disassembling document cover speaks for itself...."
2,very disappointed,"i was looking for a scanner to fix old pictures with, scratches, tears ect... and this says it restores fotos quickly, i wasn't too impressed with the software, the higher the resolution you scan at, the longer it takes (which i knew) and the software freezes. i really wanted to just punch something using this. there is a warm up period with this scanner. for a 130 bucks, i really expecetd a little better. maybe it's me. i would pass this one by if i were you. and the instructions could be a whole lot better. i bought it on friday, and it's going back sunday. maybe my next one will last longer."
2,Quinny is Silly,"Quinny is a listener, all right. She is an eavesdropper who jumps to some very silly conclusions. Harriet the Spy was at least intelligent and she took good notes. She knew the art of how to be discreet for the most part. Quinny is like a bull in a china shop. Just watch out for her horns."
4,Qucik and easy,"An informative look at an interesting but obscure piece of history that reads easily.As a mathemetician, I had heard of some mentions of Newton's 'evilness,' and this certainly confirms this. To a great degree, it shows how government can and does skew research moneys to those with connections."
1,too weak,"It was too fragile. Two days later from delivery, It was totally destroyed.On the top of that, Kids don't like to play with it."
4,Great for kids,"The bucket balance scale is great for my kids learning ""what is heavier or lighter"" My kids are 5, 3, (& 2 although he doesn't use it that often). It is great for this age group!"
3,"First Enron, Now Fascism","There are many types of Feng Shui available to practice and study in this country. A particular philosophy may work well for one person and another person may have difficulty. The biggest problem is Feng Shui fascists who declare what is Feng Shui and what is not. If you are interested in learning more about possible ways to increase wealth opportunities in your life, then this book may be helpful to you. If you prefer rigid mathematical problem solving to using your intuition, then perhaps this is not the book for you."
3,"Worked fine, but not for long enough","I purchased the printer about a year ago and it worked quite well for me until a couple weeks back. Just stopped working. When connecting via USB, the driver will not recognize the printer. When it was working, I was pretty pleased with the output. I used it mostly for text and it was certainly adequate for that. Sadly, I've had to junk the thing, and just after shelling out $70 for a new toner cartridge. Sigh . . . I've replaced it with a Brother wireless printer. Hopefully that one will last a bit longer."
4,Great Value,"This is a great little printer. Easy to set up, not a whole lot of features, which is fine with me (I like to keep it simple). A little noisy when it's turned on but once it starts printing very fast. I am very satisfied."
5,Fun and Easy,"If you are like me and love to stamp but don't have a ton of time, the Stamp Press makes life easy! The lines on the Press itself help ensure that you've laid the stamps out in straight, even lines (if that's what you are going for)! I used this to make all of my Christmas cards this year and it went super quick because I was able to lay all of my designs out at once and stamp and press-everyone loved my homemade cards and I saved money in the process!"
4,Great Beginning,"America under attack.Living in a bomb shelter for 14 months.Not knowing what is happening above ground.Could you handle it?For sixteen-year-olds, Tanya and Tommy, they have no other choice, when they find themselves surrogate parents to a gaggle of children, after Russia declares nuclear war upon the U.S.Ten-year-olds will enjoy this fast-moving tale of adventure, and humor, that shows no matter what the odds are you can always overcome them with perseverance and faith."
1,For Brides with little-no taste,"I'm sorry, but brides in 2000 are a little less pompous than this. For those that are, please excuse me. This music is unimaginative, unromantic and certainly creates an air of sterility and formality - if that's your thing, go for it, but my upcoming marriage is about love, intimacy and romance and this CD is NOT for us."
3,magnification spot too large,"I find that these are difficult to use when working outside doing yardwork since the unmagnified field of view is a bit narrow top to bottom. However when working on a project that involves reading or measuring, e.g. putting up a deck, or making close in cuts the magnified section seems about right"
5,BIFOCAL Reading Safety Glasses in Polycarbonate Gray Lens +1.5 Diopter,"I bought three pairs; I wish I had bought thirty.My age-induced presbyopia makes it impossible for me to easily read my GPS when I'm on my motorcycle. These glasses fix that and provide sunlight protection as well. (I wear the clear ones at night.)They are shatter-proof and pretty scratch resistant and are now my constant-companion sunglasses; while driving, bicycling, or riding my motorcycle.For the price, they are a spectacular bargain."
3,Not strong enough,"The magnafication is too weak at 1.50 needs to be stronger at maybe 2.5 or 2.75, other than that they are fine."
5,"Terrific, I'm back for more.","I'm an older Dad and my boys knock glasses off my face with bats, balls and my carpentry tools -- not deliberately of course! Nevertheless if you have a very active evening and weekend sports and hobby life these are GREAT glasses. If you just need to drive/ ride with sunglasses on and see the speedometer etc they are perfect. Sit in the sun and read-- you got it.I've previously owned Dewalts which were more expensive and the all a round vision quality was not as good as these -- you could see distortion off centre AND if you fold the dewalts closed the rubber ends of the glasses scratch the inside of the lense right in the middle. These glasses last me six hectic months (on average)before something happens -- I lose them or put my spinning circular saw down on them.Crisp. clear and scratch resistant with good sun protection front and side. I also own the clear version for carpentry and playing rough out of the sun they're excellent too."
4,"Finally, bi-focal safety glasses !","After making my own bi-focals with stick on lenses for the last couple of years, I finally can buy them.The glasses work fine and are comfortable to wear.I just wish they were available in a polarized version"
3,very good 150-page book embedded in 200-page book,"The book contains much useful advice, and the authors are knowledgeable and experienced in the area. My problem with the book is the same problem as all O'Reilly books: It is too long for the given quantity of information. No one at O'Reilly seems to know how to use a red pen to remove all redundant or overly wordy text. For example, there are many paragraphs in this book that say nothing more than ""It is really, really important to think about security when designing a system."" Which is unfortunate, because there is a very good (shorter) book aching to escape from this one."
2,"Great, but...","I looked up this product and found it specifically fit my particular vehicle. All of the wires are labeled with what they are, and the packaging also is labeled with what each color is for. I wired it to the connector for my new car stereo and found that the connector was an exact mirror image of what was needed for my car. I compared the wiring for my car and found none of the wires were in the right spots, either. After rewiring the connector and some minor modifications to the vehicle wiring harness (removing the tabs that no longer lined up), it fits and works. The original design was amazingly simple and straightforward, but the extra steps I needed to take are definitely not for the average do-it-yourselfer. Hopefully you will have better luck than I did..."
2,Great Gauge but misleading description,"Great gauge, but the description states '11"" hose*' (no hose!!). There is no photo other than a photo of the face of the dial, and there is no explanation of the *. This is identical to the 0-60 accu-gage except it goes from 0 to 100. I wanted, and expected, the hose for hard to reach areas. They need to re-write the description and show a more accurate photo than just the gauge face/dial and explain the asterix. I am unhappy with the time wasted and will return it as it is not as described to get the hose type. Great price though."
4,Lazy boys hacks,Great book with great content I recommend it to anyone who want to take there film making a step forward and is to busy or lazy to download the information from the internet becaue it is all there. Spread around of course but you will find every piece of information even most of the pictures used in this book so. If you have time and dedication you can save yourself the money by looking it up on the internet.
4,great primary resource,"This is a great primary resource for WWI. It contains the account of Henry Cabot Lodge, one of the leading opponets of the League of Nations, and explains his reasons for opposing entry into the organization. Includes minutes from meetings with the president and other senators."
4,Guitaragas,"The late 1960s were a time of raw innovation, cultural blendings, genre bendings, and what-the-hell experiments. In A=MH2, Mick Hutchinson took the blues guitar stylings of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Fleetwood Mac, Chicken Shack and The Groundhogs and blended them with the trance-inducing rhythmic pulse of Indian music. Ragas for blues guitar, in a word.The results were not entirely successful, but nonetheless proved highly influential. Guitarists as diverse as Peter Green, John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock have cited this LP as a major influence, and Mick's talents were equal to any of them. Filled out by the saxes, keyboards and drums of Andy Clark, this album is an amazing historical document of a time when artists were free to try anything."
2,Forgettable blues-rock,"This album was a complete disappointment for me.The album to get from these guys is the next one called,Retribution.Don't bother with their last one,Gestalt,either.I can't think of a single song on A=MH2 worth listening to.The CD that I purchased comes with a second CD of an album recorded earlier in 1969 that was never released.This one consists of really lame,boring blues songs that for a prog-head like me are on the same level as country.By the next album these guys had a legitimate band instead of the twosome playing all the instruments and maybe that's why it's so much better.The song to listen to is ""Free to be Stoned"" which is a killer rock tune with some smokin' guitar.By the way is that Charlie Manson on the cover of this album?"
3,Book presentation,"JUST THE WAY IT IS, 1944GAMBLER WITH A GUNHarry Duke has a reputation. As a gambler. And in Bentonville, USA, gambling is King. But Duke has another reputation. He killed a man once. So no-one messes with Harry Duke.That is, until someone tries to make it look like Duke slit a guy's throat one night. It's a neat frame-up. But Duke still has a few aces in his hand.Aces and a gun...See more at http://jameshadleychase.free.fr"" A collector's item. ""EASTERN DAILY PRESS"
2,Poor performance,"Difficult to read because dial face is at at an angle when pressure is read. Also, unless stem is place just right too much air leaks out of tire."
2,Not universal,"This does not fit my wheels. It needs a hose to fit more stem configurations. The 100 is identical, except for the 0-60 it is 0-100, but states it has a 11"" hose but it doesn't. I recommend a type with a hose for versatility. The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications. If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100. This is not for all applications. Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away."
2,Not for Scooters,"Got this gauge for my scooter with 10 inch wheels. The neck is too long, and the angle is not steep enough to place it in the back wheel. The exhaust and brakes get in the way. While it worked for the front tire, it was an awkward angle. Seems like decent enough gauge for cars, just not for my scooter."
2,THIS ITEM DOES NOT HAVE A PRESSURE RELEASE BUTTON,This item was not described properly on the packaging. It was described to have a pressure release button and it does not.
3,Works well barebones Gauge,This gauge works well however doesn't have a deflate button nor a needle reset feature. Once the gauge is removed from the tire the reading disappears.
2,Tire Pressure Gauge,"I bought two unit of the same model. However, when I connected them to my tire, the gauge shows different readings for each unit. The question is, which is the correct reading. Or are both readings in error. Very disappointing. Am I right to think that these tire gauges are just estimates.Eric Gotamco"
5,"Fascinating, meaningful and thoroughly entertaining....","I've been a huge fan of the works of Isherwood my whole life it seems, and this was such a rewarding experience. One of the best documantaries I've ever seen.It was so interesting to see the archival footage of Christopher and Don and the interviews of friends and biographers. a real journey beautifully told and poignant. If you love the lives of writers this DVD is a must.Gursel AliMelbourne, Aostralia"
5,A remarkable romance!,"The documentary of author Christopher Isherwood's decades-long relationship with his much younger partner, Don Bachardy. Both idyllic and heart-breaking, I gave it 5 stars--here's the L.A. Times review [...]"
1,This book is not very in-depth,"I was expecting this book to have lots of good images of cheongsams- I am making Chinese designs for a fashion show and I needed inspiration. Instead, I find about 8 or 10 color photographs, and a few black-and-white ones. Some photos were simply of tailors cutting cheongsam cloth, or the streets of Shanghai. Needless to say, this book was not very visually inspiring. Additionally, it is very small- about the size of half a sheet of paper- and so short that I read it in about an hour. Not recommended! I do wish that someone would write a better book about cheongsams with lots and lots of beautiful pictures."
4,Great,My book was recieved before I expected it and it was in good condition. It was a pleasure buying from Belkisa.
4,As advertised.,why are there nineteen words required when far less would be sufficient to describe how the product performed for me?
3,Classic Movie Mistake,"This movie contains one of the all time great movie mistakes. Set in 1863 Utah one of the characters makes a reference to the Custer massacre (1876). Of course there's all the carousing, drinking, gambling, etc with nary a Mormon settler to be seen to even glance in disapproval at all the wanton sinfulness. A young Glen Ford, nice technicolor and a somewhat unbelievable plot make this a pleasant time consumer."
4,Almost Perfect,"Got exactly what I wanted in a timely manner and cheaper than your local shop. However a few of the boxes did have water damage, as if something was spilled on them (2 of the 10). The small amount of damage is not worth me returning them however, and other than that I was completely satisfied."
2,Not as good as other brands,"These boxes do the job, but they differ from other generic brands that I have bought in the past. The main problem is that, height - wise, they are shorter, so if you make your own title dividers, they will not fit in the box because the height of the box is practically flush with the height of a comic book. This also means that your comics may get slightly crushed if you stack your long boxes on top of each other. The generics that I used to use generally have about 1 1/2 - 2 inches of clearance between the top of my comics and the top of the box.I would not uses these boxes if you are worried about protecting your books."
4,great racquet.,I really like this racquet. It is head heavy but you don't notice it while playing. It is very manageable and powerful. Definitely feel a little vibration on returns but nothing a 5.00 damper won't fix.
4,Good racquet. No cover.,"I bought this for my wife to use when we play together. She loves the racquet so far, but for a nicer racquet such as this, I would have expected it to come with a protective cover as well. Not a huge deal, but it's nice to be able to store balls and goggles in the cover for convenience. Overall, great racquet and a good deal, though."
3,Good Book,Its pretty basic but has a lot of good info. I am not a novice but not an expert. This book had a lot of good info.
4,"Great, but...","I have one of these (or it's immediate predacessor model) for 5 years and it worked flawlessly. Then one day I was knee deep in the swamp cutting cattails just under the waterline and KABLOOEY! The cattails wrapped around the bush cutter head and the EZ Link drive cable twisted apart at the coupling. I thought it could do everything! I was disappointed. ;-))Actually I give it 5 stars. It was saftey engineered well enough that I didn't have my arm cut off when the cutting head wrapped around the cattails and pulled me off my feet into the swamp and the cutter. The safety engine kill and brake worked like a charm.I took the motor (which was still alright) and made a fence post auger out of it. That sucker has some torque!Yes, I am a red-neck if you were wondering..."
5,Troy Built TB590BC w/ easy link coupler,"This e-z link string trimmer, brush cutter and mini chainsaw is far more powerful and well-made that I anticipated. I have had string trimmers and e-z link units in the past...none compare."
1,Troybilt will not honor warranty,"I have two things wrong with a trimmer that has been used less than 15 times, the carburetor is fouled causing the engine to sputter and there is a stripped part in the shaft causing the head to not turn properly.I have had several conversations with both Troybilt and their authorized service center about these. Even though they admit that the carburetor can foul under NORMAL conditions such as mine (sat idly in the garage for a few weeks) they refuse to fix it under the warranty. They consider the stripped part to be ""normal wear and tear"", which after < 15 uses is absurd.The repair costs are over $130. This is too expensive a trimmer to be disposable. If my very light usage and normal care results like this, and Troybilt won't honor the warranty, I suggest you look elsewhere for a trimmer."
3,Best Seller?,"I can't say why this is number 1 on the Amazon Karaoke DVD best seller list. I'd rate it fair, as I find Pioneer much better that the VuTech, from menus to video content and music. The vocals seem about the same quality. I bought it for some of the songs and out of curiosity. I was disappointed with Don't Cry for me Argentina as it was the disco version rather than the one Madonna sang on the balcony in the movie Evita."
2,Not Completely Happy,"The over all quality seems good, however I could only get 2 of the 3 chambers to work , so after reviewing the supplier's website it shows that to fix you may need to prime , after about 15 mins of following instructions on how to prime, chamber still does not pump , so I assume what is needed is a pump , I have another complete unit coming thinking that I would just use it for parts , hopefully all three chambers will work on the 2nd unit I have coming ."
5,Customer Best Buy,"Bought one in January to see how I would like it. Love it. Not only was it a breeze to install but it has saved me $$ in shampoo,conditioner and body wash. This dispenser is GREAT. Today, I am order another for the guest bath. Love this product!!!"
2,Broke first day,"Put it up in the corner (waited 24 hrs), filled it with shampoo, body wash and conditioner and primed the pumps. Daughter got in the shower and pushed the button to get the body wash and it fell down and busted on the shower floor.Looked good but am now very disappointed."
3,Broken Tongue,"This is a nice toy for the crib to entertain your child when he or she wakes up, however after having it only a month or two the snake's tongue stopped working (you pull on it and it goes back in with a noise). This was one of the most interactive aspects of the toy, so it's disappointing that it broke so quick."
2,Creating Melodies,"Not enough information regarding contouring, retrograde, melodic inversions etc... Most of it is common sense if you're a beginner it might help somewhat."
3,for beginners only,"If you bear in mind that this is intended (or seems to be intended) for those with only a very rudimentary knowledge of music, you'll be less likely to be disappointed with it. The actual materials of melody are of course scales and chords. To learn about scalar material you are probably not familiar with (not matter how extensive your knowledge of music) I recommend PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
4,fast service,delivery was very fast. Shipping was twice the cost of the item. All in all it was still cheaper than the local store.
3,"Isn't Pretty, Does the Job","This product does the job, and fit right in to the car with no modifications or hammer-tweaks required. For the price, you really can't find anything better. This is not a 'performance' item, with its incredibly smashed/crinkled construction, but my mileage is same as usual, about 22.5-23 mpg. When and if this thing finally rusts out, I'll buy another one."
1,It falls off much too easily!!,"I purchased this and was only able to use it for a short two weeks, until it fell off of my diaper bag and is lost already!! Other people's reviews stated that it fell off too easily, and I should have listened. The strap that attaches it to the diaper bag closes with a snap, which is not AT ALL strong enough. It falls off just from brushing against it. Otherwise, it would have been a great accessory."
1,Defective,"Arrived with a broken zipper, thank you very much, which is not something that could have happened during shipping. That means it was sent out even though it obviously defective."
3,"Serves its purpose, but mine rusted!","I have this in black and it works fine for what it is. It holds a pacifier, nothing more. However, mine corroded and rusted on the zipper parts. I don't want rust anywhere near something my child will put in his mouth so I'll be looking for an alternative. I never submerged it in water, only wiped clean. I expected higher quality from Skip Hop."
4,Holds 4 pacifiers!,"No more lost pacifiers! With twin boys, I need to know that I have spare pacifiers on hand and I am able to fit four extra pacifiers in this pocket. And I always know where they will be as it conveniently snaps onto the strap of my diaper bag and stays put!"
4,Handy,For those times when baby is not interested in paci but might demand it when out of the house. This one seems durable and waterproof. We attach it to outside of diaper bag.
3,Would be great except for snap,"It's a nice pouch and holds 1-2 pacifiers. However, the snap keeps coming undone. It's intended to be hooked onto a diaper bag or purse, so it's pretty important that it stays put!"
3,worked well,"This pacifier holder was adorable. It held only 1 pacifier at a time, but worked well for my needs. I always knew where I could find the binky when I needed it."
2,Poor quality,We used this for about 1 month...it would not stay snapped to our diaper bag so we had to store it inside the bag. Then the zipper broke! So now I am going to buy a different brand to replace it. Not happy with the quality. Could barely fit 2 Nuk pacifiers in it.
2,"2 stars because it will hold a pacifier, but that is it","2 stars, because it will hold a pacifier, but that is it. I got it to keep my child's pacifiers where i could easily find them hanging off the shoulder strap of my diaper bag, but the snap on this is worthless, and it ends up in the bottom of my diaper bag somewhere, and i would always be searching for it, so i don't bother even using it. Don't Buy it, unless your putting the pacifier pocket in your pocket! a zip lock bag would work just as well as this pocket!"
2,Comes unsnapped,"I bought this because I like Skip Hop and my JJ Cole's velcro was coming off of my other pacy holder. It was such a disappointment. The zippered holder works great but if you want to hang it on your diaper bag forget it! After about 2-3 weeks of using it you will be in a store with a screaming child and you look to where the pacy holder should be just to find it not there because it fell off on the way to the car. But if you are just going to shove it in your bag then I would choose this one over the rest, but if you want an easily accessible one to attach to your bag's straps choose another one."
2,skip hop pacifer pod,"I got this as a shower gift and thought I could use it attached to my diaper bag. It worked great until the snap came undone and the whole thing fell off. And, it had 2 pacifiers in it (one with a clip)! I never found it and now I am in need of another one. I don't think I will be getting a skip hop this time. I will search for one that will hook to my diaper bag in a more secure way."
2,Easy to lose,A pacifier case in a bright red easy to find case is a great idea. The latch to affix it to your diaper bag has a snap which opens too readily; this makes the case way too easy to lose. Skip Hop should change the design to make the latch close with velcro instead.
4,Light Mules,"I love Arcopedico's lace-up shoes of the same fabric as these slip-ons. However, the mules tend to fall off your feet a bit unless you wear heavy socks under them. They are comfortable, but I had to put a little pad in each shoe for more support."
4,Road Trip? Indespensible....,"This was an indespensible part of a recent road trip I took with my kids through Wyoming. It was a convenient source for side excursions and ways to see things off the ""tourist trail"". It also presents little known facts and anecdotes. I also own its companion for Texas. You cannot say you truly know a place unless you own one of these books for the State in which you live. The books open a whole new world of weekend excursions to places and things odd, quirky, historic and wonderful. I highly recommend any in this series."
4,Great DVD,"This DVD is Paul Oakenfolds Voyage into Trance with Chromadepth 3d visuals. I'm glad I purchased this although I already owned the CD. The visuals make it worth the buy if thats what your looking for. The DVD only comes with 1 set of glasses. I wanted more so others could watch with me and they are available online for purchase. When purchasing them everywhere had a choice between regular glasses and HD glasses for the same price. Their explanation was that the HD is for movies, regular are for still pics/comics. When they arrived I soon realized the DVD comes with the regular glasses and there is definately a noticeable difference. I would recommed getting the HDs especially if your looking to get more so others may view as well. Overall I recommed purchasing this."
3,"Some Good, Some Not So Good....","Oakenfold rules the treance/techno scene. That's a given. He's nowhere to be found on this DVD though. It is just his album, basically, with a light and laser show. You could get the same effect playing the CD on your computer and watching the show that Windows Player shows. This is just for true fans who rewally feel the need to collect everything with Oakenfold's name on it. Good addition to the collection, though."
5,KEYS,ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. IT TRANSPORTS THE LISTENER TO A SPIRITUAL PLACE - NOTHING LIKE IT! I'VE JUST PURCHASED WHATEVER IS AVAILABLE BY THIS MUSICIAN.
2,Boo,This is a poorly done wrestling movie. That matches are not very good either. Don't waste the money on this movie. Get something worth it like the Sable movie. That is a good movie.
4,Pig's blood?,"I found this book interesting more for it's description of a pivotal period in the history of modern technology than for it's mystery and mayham. The book provides a dramatic picture of the early history of the automobile and of flight and of the social turmoil that this incipient technology caused for the average person. I also enjoyed the descriptions of various social groups, for their varied reactions to the new technology but more importantly to one another in the venue of what would shortly become, as the reader is aware, massive social change. The book is an interesting take on change as well as a good ""who-dun-it."""
4,Well written,Fun to follow Kate's adventures. You can feel like you are living in this time frame and seeing the country side with her eyes.
3,Not as good as the others in the series,"I really enjoy Robin Paige and his Victorian series, but I found that this book wasn't as good as the previous ones in the series. We get a good look at ballooning and automotive enthusiasts from the late Victorian era, and that part is fun. The way Mr. Paige mixes historical with fiction is a treat. I just found that the mystery wasn't very gripping. Kate and Charles are an engaging couple. We get a good look at early forensics, and some of the problems that were encountered when trying to introduce this fledging science into a court room. But I found the ending kind of left me hanging. There was no clear resolution. Hoping for better things with the next book in the series."
5,DIGITAL TIMER,"THIS ITEM DOES EVERYTHING I NEEDED IT TO DO, WHICH WAS TO REPLACE MY MECHANICAL WHOLE HOUSE FAN TIMER. ALSO MOUNTS IN STANDARD ELECTRICAL BOX AND USES A STANDARD COVER PLATE. COULD NOT FIND A PRODUCT AT HALF THE PRICE AT LOCAL STORES."
5,Mathematics for Economist...,Very good review tool for graduate level Microeconomic theory....it is a little more in depth than Chang & Wainwright's Math for Economist...definitely should get and keep as a reference...
3,it's not bad as a reference,"It's not a bad book, it will cover everything you will ever need for economics. The only downside of the book is that you kind of have to already know what it is you want to do in order to use the book. If you don't know how to do something, this is not the book for you. If you know what you are looking for though, like maximizing a constrained function with Lagrange multipliers, then it is easy to use the book. If all you know is that you want to optimize something, start somewhere else. The book makes topics overly complicated."
1,Don't buy if you can avoid it,"Worst math textbook ever. Poorly written, badly formatted, and terrible examples. This book hasn't been updated since 1994. If you can convince your prof to use another book for future students, do it."
1,Not for the Math Econ Novice,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of one of my Ph.D. program professors who likes it better than de la Fuente's book. I agree that it's better than Fuente, but that's not saying much. Simon and Blume wrote the book for people who not only already know mathematical economics, but who also think fluently in mathematics. It's not for the beginning Ph.D. candidate in economics, but for the accomplished professor. If you already know the material, I suspect that Simon and Blume will allow you to quickly reference any of the topics it covers. If you're struggling to learn mathematical economics, however, don't try to use this book because it will reinforce any fears you might have about your ability to learn the subject in the first place."
3,Good econ/math text,"This is a good book for Economists that need a math review. However, I had a problem teaching myself from this one."
5,One of the best,"This is indeed an excellent book. I like it because it is not ""dumbed"" to fit students with a weak background in mathematics and it is not a definition-proof-theorem-and-try-to-understand-if-you-can book as many advanced books in mathematics. It is well balanced between precise definitions and good explanations, using standard notation. I have used it for self-study and helped me to learn the definitions and theorems needed to jump to more advanced books (yes, to those skinny books with only definitions, theorems and so on). Other books on mathematics for economists are either too hard to understand the first time or they hid the difficults parts."
5,The best math book for economists!,"The book does not merely provide a sequence of theorems, but helps to develops mathematical intuition which is really critical for economists. I don't have any hesitation to strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the essential mathematics for economics. One of the best economics books I've ever read!"
4,Excellent book for basic concepts,This book is really excellent in the sense that it unfolds to the reader not only the logic behind the application of the mathematical tools to economics but also the fundamentals about the mathematical formulations themselves.
1,Mathematics for Economists,Where is the Comparitve Statics section? Dynamic Analysis? Difference equations? Calculus of Variations? Optimal Control? Etc.
3,Chiang's book is the best.,"This book is decent, but I think that Chiang book is better that this book, I recommend you the Chiang book, this book is only the a fundamental introduction to Math-Econ."
5,Mysterious,"I just picked this deck up the other day. I'm fluent in most tarot decks and like seeing new ones. This deck is truly a new challenge. I don't recommend it to the beginner, but rather to the advanced tarot student who is more visual - works with images and likes hindu~tantric~kali esque ideas... i can tell the deck is based on the traditional tarot deck but it's really hard to figure out...i'm finding this deck a challenge because there really aren't any directions or booklet. I think it's trying to be mysterious on purpose...- because it's a really intense beautiful deck, i'll invest in the book...blessed be"
2,unenjoyable,"Having become interested recently in the tantric area I was delighted to see this deck. However the cards are, as a previous reviewer said, ugly. Infact I was repelled. The imagery was, I felt, random and crude (not as in rude). It was nothing like the front cover indicated ie traditional imagery. The back also does not give any indication to what is inside. It states ""...archetypal images drawn from Eastern mystical teachings..."" Be warned! I doubt if I will ever use this deck although I respect those who can."
1,Horrible.,"I was in the bookstore with a friend who told me he'd buy me a deck of my choice. I was torn between this deck and a tarot deck that I'd never seen before. I got this deck; big mistake.These have to be some of the UGLIEST divination/tarot cards ever created. The colors are garish and horrible, and the backs of the cards are completely uninspired. The card stock quality feels very cheap and flimsy, also, although the packaging is nice. I don't know what the artist of this deck was thinking about, but I found the ugly imagery to be so disturbing that I never, ever, ever use the deck. This set seems like nothing but a poor man's ""Osho Zen Tarot"" deck, and it fails pathetically. This could have been very good. Divination cards are supposed to inspire and enlighten. What happened?"
5,advice for life,"I feel that this is a wonderful about life and how to get through it.This detailed book gives you life lessons for acheving your dreams. Jeter tells you that you need to set reachable goals and to always work your hardest. One of his chapters is entitled ""Think Before You Act"" which is a very wise aspect on life. Also he talksabout not being afriad to fail.In chaptre nine wich is caled ""Think before you act"" he calls one of his friends who had violated a drug policy and mentioned this saying to him because this problem got him in alot of trouble with baseball and the law. Every one should think aout their actions and the possible consequences involved.i hope that i persawded you to take int rest in this book."
5,A VERY GOOD BOOK TO GIVE TO A CHILD,"This is a very good book to give to a child because it teaches a lot about role models, good parenting etc. However, an adult may find it a bit boring since Derek Jeter tends to repeat himself over and over again about what a good boy he was growing up and how perfect his parents are. It's wonderful that Derek Jeter has great relationship with his parents but does he have to repeat the same remarks about them from beginning to end of the book???However, I am still a big fan!!!!!!!!"
2,My review of the book,"This looked like just the thing for my step-grandson, who loves Derek Jeter and who needs inspiration. However, it turned out he already had the book. I can't comment on the book, as I didn't read it."
4,Good Advice,"Most of the book has good advice. For those of us in our mid-life stage, it is good to pass on to our children. We may be jaded about some of the ideas, yet those are ones that we also want to impress upon our gets. What better way than from the mouths of the heroes themselves?Of course, there are the typical views of the up-and-comers. For example, Jeter says it has nothing to do with luck. Yet, he gives a large part of the credit for his success to his parents. Of course, as even he recognizes, not all kids are born into such families. Hence, ""luck"" does have something to do with it. That should not deter us, but it shows the common conflicts of such views.Good gift idea for any younger Yankees fan and parents."
5,A Motivational Masterpiece!,"Jack Curry truly captures your heart in this inspirational, motivational masterpiece! Read this book and follow life's instructions on how to accomplish your goals and achieve your dreams. If you're a Jeter fan, well...you won't be able to turn the pages fast enough. It's the only book that provides the real insight on #2! Thank you Mr. Curry for showing us the way to a bright future!"
3,Decent at best. The middle needs a good pick-me-up.,"Well let's see here. Basically, old Stevie need a female in his life. His books directly reflect his lack of a personality. It seems that on Saturday night old Stevie was in his room writing....not good social behavior I shall state. But, it paid off. Steve has no friends, but, he has a book."
2,Disappointing Heroine,"The only reason that I gave this novel 2 stars was because of the strong and ever so patient male lead - Jordan Saber. Leslie Collins, the female protagonist, was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I understand her hesitancy to get involved with anyone after a traumatic attack. Her reaction was understandable, to a point. Her refusual to cooperate and allow Jordan to protect her did not make any sense and was completely unreasonable. He had every right to know who was stalking her if for no other reason to protect the others who lived on his property. Also, the presence of the second ""stalker"" was ludicrous and did not add anything to the story. Jordan had the patience of Job. His devotion and singlemindedness in winning Leslie's love was enjoyable to read. However after awhile their dialogue got repetitive. Lastly, when they do finally sleep together, it was BORING! This is not even a good read on a rainy day, when you have a cold and the cable is out!"
2,disappointed,I have read Gynne Fosters books and I think she should stick to what she knows. Against the Wind spent too much time on the racial conflict and not enough time on the real story between the main characters. I will still buy her books but I hope she writes her usual great book next time.
1,Was this even edited?,"The blurb made the characters seem interesting....WRONG! First, did anyone bother to proofread this? The typos were rampant and annoying, the grammatic errors were frequent and the story was just underdeveloped! One minute she's running from him and the next they're sailing? Too many unfinished scenes to keep track of what was taking place. Besides, if the author doesn't know who's speaking from one moment to the next, how am I supposed to?The female lead's reason for running was extremely weak and her reason for hiding the story was even weaker.The male lead didn't really have a reason to fall in love with her. It seems like he fell in love with the first woman who didn't run from him.The relationship between the two characters never developed and in the end, I wanted them to be together only to end the story."
1,I want my money back!,"I am so disappointed with the publisher for allowing this book to be released as is. Where was the editor??? How could Forster allow herself to be humilated by this work?! If there was any integrity with the author or publisher they would pull this book from the market and re-do it! I have learned a hard lesson, and thats to READ THE REVIEWS before purchasing a book. For anyone who is on the fence about buying this book, let me be the one to push you over to the side of common sense. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,A Complete Dud!,"Leslie Collins (black bank officer) is forced to flee her home town to escape a man who attempted to rape her. After three years in jail, he is seeking revenge. Leslie takes a job as a cook on the Saber Estates of John Saber (white University professor cum farmer). Leslie wears her secret like a cloak and fights her attraction for Jordan.This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I just could not get into the story. The story reminded me of the Barbara Cartland formula of the misunderstood (the reader and love interest thinks he is a pig, however those who know him loves him) duke/earl/lord and his exasperating love interest. Leslie was cold, repressive and frigid and Jordan was overbearing. Since they never really dated I was left not knowing why these two would get together. The tension related to Leslie's stalker that should have made for interesting reading was treated as an afterthought and was never fully developed.This novel was a complete waste of my time!"
2,Read only if bored,"This book wasn't very good. It is a contemporary romance, yet the dialogue made it seem like the 18th century. The main characters are Jordan Saber, a tenured professor/ farmer and Leslie Collins, a woman running from her past. Leslie is hiding from a man out for revenge after she testified against him in court. She finds work with Jordan and the two proceed to fall in love. Seems like a cut and dry story, right? The author decides to write all about their thoughts about one another, and the plot falls to the wayside. The plot is literally concluded in 3/4 pages at the end and the stalker has about 3 lines. Jordan wasn't a developed as he could have been and Leslie was just a pain to read about."
3,"Great story, poor layout",This was my first interracial novel. I loved the old-fashioned down home I'd rather read this than eat a biscuit feel it delivered. I particularly enjoyed that race was not a overriding theme in this book. It served as minor (sometimes forced by the female protagonist) tension. Thanks to the comforting story-line I am now interested in more interracial novels with woc as the leads. I gave the review a 3 because it was poorly edited causing me to lose track of paragraph themes often. I got the book discounted so I thought it was a flawed copy. From the looks of other reviews I was sadly mistaken.
3,Good Enough,"This was a good enough read for a lazy weekend. It is no great literary feat, however it was an interesting story that kept my attention... not great, but ... good enough, worth it's cost."
1,Buy Something Else.,"I brought this book mainly for the beautiful and sweet cover. I should've passed on it. What upset me about this book is that the relationship between the heroine and hero was too Master and Slave than of equal, loving partners. The heroine had NO PERSONALITY.She was subservient and apologized for arguing with the hero. He was the rich powerful PLANTATION OWNER and she was a meek plantation worker. He offended me."
2,Against the Wall...,"That's what this book should have been titled, because I felt like I was banging my *head* against the wall. This book was honestly the worst I have read in a long time. The character of Leslie is so frustrating and indesicive. One minute she wants Jordan and the next she doesn't. On and on, back and forth. Her attitude sucked all the romance out of the novel. By the half-way point, I was hoping another heroine would pop up to grab Jordan's attention. I'm not sure what Ms. Forster was going for when developing the character of Leslie...but she has succeeded in creating one of the most unlikeable, wishy-washy, teases that I have ever had the displeasure of reading about. Sorry, but true.Trust me on this...save your money and use it on titled like ""Three Wishes"" or ""At Last"". There are so many to choose from there is no need to endure this dribble."
3,Typos ruined it for me.,"From what I can tell, this story was written about ten years ago, so I can forgive some of the portrayed attitudes about an interracial couple; but combined with all the glaring typos: missing chunks of text, garbled sentences, sometimes duplicate lines of text, and worst of all, misplaced pronouns ('him' when it should have been 'her'). I was pretty fed up by the end of the book. It was a nice enough story, but I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Interesting Reading -,"This book was interesting, but there were too many typographical errors in this print of the book which frustrated me as well as disappointed me. The main characters were not what I expected. I have not finished the book and not sure that I want to. Don't buy it - borrow it."
2,1 bad apple,One bad apple doesn't spoil the whole bunch. I have read all of Gwynne's books and thoroughly enjoyed them all with the exception of this one. I felt like the characters were under-developed as well as the relationship between Leslie and Jordon. To me it just stunk. I wished that she had dealt with the romance between the two of them more and made Leslie a little less stubborn and stupid in the ways of romance and Jordon a little more human and less the perfect love God.
1,AHHH Come on!!!,"I am a black female in an interracial marriage and this book was just a bunch of bull! No one talks like this,I understood that it was a romance novel, but the author just kept hitting you over the head with this ""love novel"" language and it got old real quick. I threw this book away because I didn't want to waste anyone else's time and have them read it! I look for books with this type of relationship, but I wish I had left this one out in cyberspace!"
3,I've read better but it's ok,"This book was ok but I wish the characters and story were a bit better. I thought Leslie was a little too insecure and hung up on the fact that Jordan was her employer and he was white. Jordan just seemed too alpha male and the fact he called Leslie ""woman"" kind of drove me nuts. It had it's good parts and you could see the love they have for each other, I just wish it could've been better, especially the ending. It's a pretty good book, I just wish that it was more developed."
2,Nothing impressive about this one,"I should have known this novel wouldn't be to my liking. After all, I did not particularly enjoy Wessel's two previous efforts. I was told that, when it comes to this author, third time's a charm -- that this novel shows some growth and improvement. What I got was the typical detective blabber that makes novels of this kind trite and, believe it or not, predictable. I'd skip this one if I were you."
3,Ever hopeful!,"This purchase took longer than any other purchase I have made via Amazon. It was so expensive, I was feeling guilty about spending the money before it arrived and so far, am still waiting for it to do anything magic or even anything more than my $10 moisturiser does - it cost me more than $100!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Almost disappointed but still hopeful."
2,Trainspotters only -,"I really wanted to love this CD, I would love to love it but for me it fails.I love a good production but for me it's to over engineered and over thought. Damn you Mr Mills you buried the excitement whilst getting all perfect.An inspiring idea but not an inspiring result.This could have been GREAT experimental and could have gone to another level in rhythm and sound excitement... most of the tracks start going toward a good place but they just do not deliver!A really disappointing 2 out of 5 - 2 for trying and I am sure on some level I like it. This is a CD I will look at on the shelf feel excitement then remember it just does not go anywhere. Sorry J.Mills - I invite you to open my mind and help me understand this CD."
4,GREAT MUSIC for film background,"EXCEPT FOR THE clips of heated conversation in a few peices, the bulk of Clement/Deschamps CD are placeable with movies. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a relaxing setting, although a few are slightly haunting."
4,Works Great!,"A solid and reliable solution with the variable temperature and cooling functionality needed to insure multiple applications and longer service life than other like models on the market - without the higher costs of the supposed higher-end units that sell for much more. The bottom line is it's easy to handle, gets the job done, and doesn't break the bank in the process."
4,Good heat gun,"This heat gun works as advertised. I have not used it very often, so can't speak for how long it will last."
5,Great way to protect inkjet printed material,This product is a littly pricy but it dries fast as advertised and has low odor during spraying. I used to protect inkjet printed labels for homemade wine and it worked super for that!
5,"LOVE , LOVE, LOVE,",OMG this was the best thing ever. it really does make cd labels water proof. granted that your house spell like fresh paint. this item is worth everything. i still have some left over and i sprayed like 100 cds. i used this for photos also and it made the hp glossy photo paper kind of a grainy sandpaper feel but it was waterproof and it works like a freaking charm...i am glad i found this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,What a treat !,"I am only marginally knowledgeable about ballet, having seen fewer than a dozen NYCB and ABT performances primarily to hear the music (e.g., The Four Temperaments). I don't even know why I decided to purchase this DVD, but I'm so glad I did ! I found it completely engrossing, and now I'm driven to explore ballet further. There is amazing footage, but it was the Don Quixote clips which brought tears to my eyes, the music, choreography, and execution were so lovely. Farrell's Don Q solo is absolutely stunning ! I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has even the slightest interest in ballet."
3,An intimate view of Suzanne Farrell's dance life.,"The DVD contained many diadatic interviews of former NYC Balanchine, ballet dancers. The content of the interviews mainly focused on the career of Suzanne Farrell and relational dynamics between Ms. Farrell and George Balanchine. The interviewees reflected on their past dance experinces during the period between the 1970's and early 80's. They discussed the influence and power Mr. Balanchine had on their dance carrers. Overall, the interviews were engaging, interesting and thoughtfully presented.However, there was a dearth of actual dance scenes with Suzanne Farrell. The dance footage contained brief glimpes and an overview of perfomances. The lack of dance scenes was very disappointing."
4,Great except for the false info about witches serving satan,"A great primer for young pagans and non-pagans. With a grain of salt. Not all the info is completely correct, but it is nicely presented and easily discussed with children. A good sourse for younger kids to learn the history of Halloween and its significance to both Pagans and non-Pagans."
1,Disappointed,I tried this for 1 night. It collapsed 3 times and would not stay adjusted as a tent over my feet. I returned the item.
4,Blanket Support,My husband sleeps much better since we purchased this blanket support. The adjustable screws need to be very tight in order not to slip.
3,"Good as a reference, but there are better books","This book did a good job of introducing and explaining the different TA tools and techniques, and the dangers one should consider in using this stuff. Also the warnings on backtesting and optimizing are helpful. However, it is not that super. I use this book as a reference when I use technical analysis, and it's very useful for that, but that's all there is to it.I think one would be better of with a book from Alexander Elder or Marcel Link for this job. These authors brought their explanation more vividly and more entertaining than this author. Also, the charts in this book aren't just that helpful to someone who is new to TA."
2,A mile wide and an inch deep material,"I have read more than a dozen books on forex, some good and some bad. I'm afraid this book is somewhere at the bottom. The author kept babbling about self-proclaimed experts in technical analysis all throughout the book it became pathetic. Discussions on most technical indicators was blurry, not the english, but the material simply was not good enough. Very flimsy in many cases and as a result gives you a feeling the author is far from being an authority on the subject. The only reason I gave a generous 2 stars is the discussion on momentum indicators where there was a little bit of substance. Example charts also were poorly selected. After reading the book I felt I really did not pick up anything new."
3,There are better resources out there,"This book does introduce you the idea of technical analysis. But even for dummies, they can still go online and learn a lot more from sites like Investopedia, EliteTrader, and Mish's economic analysis. Some of the stuff that the author talks about is complete garbage since it is not feasible. Save yourself some money and please do not buy this book."
2,There's gotta be better than this,The author attempts a very difficult subject and falls flat on her face.Very unclear. Sentences an English professor couldn't diagram. Most any other book on Technical Analysis would be better
5,THE Book to Start With If You Want to Really Learn Technical Analysis,"Fortunately for me, this was one of the first books that I bought when I began learning technical analysis. This is probably the best book I own which touches on virtually every aspect of the subject. It is clearly written, and you can certainly read it even if you know nothing. Beleive me, we have all been there. And technical analysis can seem overwhelming when you begin.My copy of this book is worn, is thoroughly underlined, and I have marked the most important pages. I still refer to it. If you want to get your money's worth, believe me, you should buy this book!"
1,NOT CLEARER THAN BEFORE STUFF,"God help the ""dummies"" who like to learn from this book. Don't get this book if you are new to technical analysis, which will NOT make you money either. It will just confuse you. I recommend Martin Pring to start out with."
5,Seems like an excellent starting point,"I've learned one thing after reading the first six chapters of this book: I need to stop trying to trade until I understand what I'm doing. I really didn't know what I was doing. Now that I know that, I'm going to finish reading this book, and I've already ordered another book listed in the appendix of this one.Without knowing much about technical analysis yet, I'd say that this book seems to be opening a door to a whole new world for me. As far as the quality of this book goes, it seems to be touching on all kinds of topics that can be further investigated.If you have an interest in the stock market and want to trade (not invest -- that's different), (and as someone who doesn't know much about it yet), I HIGHLY recommend this book as a starting point."
3,If your are a statistical person ?,"This is a good choice for the beginner, to try to the understand the complex ""Technical"" application for charting historical stock trends."
2,Typical dummies book,There was a modest amount of good info embedded in a lot of fluff and useless verbiage which is typical of these dummy books. I found myself having to carefully review and sometimes reread sections to parse out the important bits. I think what I really needed was just a book of pictures of chart patterns with short explanations for each one. Anyway I got enough out of this to get me started but it was more work on my part than it needed to be.
3,Good to learn basic theory but lacks practicality,This book offers a good theoretical introduction to the basics of technical analysis.The problem that is not addressed in this book is the probability of failure of even the strongest technical signals in real market trades.This is why it is critical that actual examples form real stock trades be included to stress to the reader that not all setups will be profitable and excercising money management and risk control are important.This is where this book fails.If you are an absolute beginner and want to start with learnings the basics of technical analysis then this book is a reasonable good start for the price and for this reason my actual rating is 3.5 starts. However you will need to read other more practical books that reinforce the theory you learned by using combinations of technical indicators and demonstrating how they are applied in real trading.
3,Resistant but...,"Great fit and stay on while running as they are supposed to, but somehow the lenses scratch easily and look dated even though they are new. Not gonna wear them anymore :("
1,Boring,This book is so boring and it's terribly written. each story babbles on and on about almost nothing. It shouldn't be called Chicago Haunts it should be called random history of the south suburbs.It's a great example of writers who just like to hear themselves talk.It's a collection of random stories but no really good one on one stories. It sucks.
5,Good Information on Ghosts in Chicago,"This a gorgeus book on Chicago Ghosts. I have long been interested in ghosts and hauntings particularly in the midwest,and I have read at least a few collections of regional ghostlore.Well, this stands out. It is a well done survey of all the ghosts of Chicago. The extensive information on Chicago's best known phantom Rez Mary is well researched. I am extremely fascinated by Resuurection Mary and if you are too, you will love this book- it is the best source of information on her and who she might have been in life.This book asserts she was most likely Anna Mary Norkus which is exactly what I believe. Anyone who is interested in Chicago ghostlore or even ghosts will go mad over this book. It's that good."
1,TO THE PUBLISHER OF THIS BOOK ABOVE,"Everyone is entitled to there opinion concerning what they read and Amazon,com graciously permits these opinions to be viewed online. The bad joke which concludes this book was done in a mocking and demeaning manner......and was meant as such! The only ""believing"" to be found in this book is in the author's own theories and write-off explanations. However many aspects that the author uses to examine the parapsychology of the great city of Chicago, her conclusions are held strictly within a closed minded framework of folklore and myth. People who have had a paranormal experience in there lives do not share that view."
4,Dillinger Walks Again in Lincoln Park!,"This compilation of Chicoland ghost stories has inspired me to explore some unique areas of the city. I've been to the Red Lion Pub, and so far, I haven't seen any spectres. Down the street is the Biograph Theater, where it is said the restless spirit of John Dillinger can be seen running down an alley. All in all, one of the best ghost story books I've ever read! Read it in a well-lit room."
3,good reading but a bit complicated,"This is a good book, but its more history and a little complicated then I would want it to be. You owe it to yourself if your looking for Ghost stories to check out the 2nd book written on this subject by the author its MUCH better then the first. It has more personal accounts then this one does."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I've been shopping w/Amazon for a very long time. I have never been disappointed...until now. To date,I have NOT received this product. My credit card statement shows that I've paid for it. I've sent 2 requests to booksellingman72315 rquesting a ship date...no response. Now, I'm a little gun shy about ordering anything else in the future."
5,The perfect sun block!,The best sun block out there I believe. Spent 8 days in Mexico with most of the time snorkling and being in the sun and as long as I had it on I found I hardly even got a tan at all! Had to cut back in the last couple days as I realized I wanted to come back with at least a partial tan! Found even tho' my face can be very sensitive that it was perfectly fine using it every day on my face and eye area. And also amazingly enough seemed to stay on quite well even in salt water!
2,Would have made a better short story or article,"The part of this book that I enjoyed the most was the opening in which General Sherman summarized the events from the previous book in the series (""Stars and Stripes Forever""). That's how I would have liked the entire book to have been handled: In a short story format. The ideas presented in the book were interesting, but I didn't enjoy having to wade through 336 pages to find them. Rather than read this book, I'd recommend waiting for the third book in the series (""Stars and Stripes Triumphant"") and read the summary of the first two books that will probably appear there."
3,A disappointing novel of alternate history.,"Stars and Stripes in Peril continues Harry Harrison's story of an Anglo-American war in the 1860s, reuniting the formerly warring North and South. While the scenario Harrison presents in fascinating, the novel, like it's predecessor, is a disappointment. Its main drawback is it's total lack of three diminsional charectors. Harrison manages to make fascinating people like Grant, Sherman, and Lee cardboard cutouts, interchangable figures in set piece situations. The reader is also wanting to know what even more fascinating Civil War actors would have behaved in the scenario he presented (Chamberlain, Armestaid, and-of course-George Armstrong Custer comes to mind.) One is left wondering what the story could have been in the hands of a far more skilled and knowlegdable writer-like Jeff Shaara-could have been.--Mark R. Whittington (...)"
4,A Role Model for All,"When I read ""Band of Brothers"" by Stephen Ambrose, it was clear that Dick Winters was a hero's hero. Major Winters only problem in this book is his modesty. This is not a sequal to Ambrose's book, but an excellent memoir of Dick Winter's life, especially as commander of 'Easy Company.' It's about comraderie, compassion,bravery, leadership, and dedication. His men loved him and you will too after reading this account of a true American hero."
5,An outstanding book on an outstanding man,"If you want a book about expert leadership that comes naturally this is the book for you. I have admired Major Winters for some time, having read of his wartime exploits in at least 6 other publications. It was nice to see his pre, during and post war experiences written from his own experience. He is generous with giving others that helped him along the way, and is not ashamed either to pass along his fair share of criticism.Truly an easy read and even though I knew the stories extremely well I still was not bored. The book is an easy read and told without a lot of military jargon. Winters really embodies the spirt of the citizen solider.His breed is dying by the scores daily. Men like him are great role models for men like me to strive to be."
4,audio book VS printed version,"The hardcopy printed book is an excellent story, so after reading it I purchased the audio version just to hear it, and pick up certain aspects that I might have missed.The audio version is good if you are familiar with the aspects of Band of Brothers, and beyond Band of Brothers.But the person who reads this audio-book seems to forget that not everybody is well versed in regards to military lingo, and terminology. Even after reading the book, the narrators fast paced reading is sometimes overwhelming."
5,Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters,"Dick Winters' personal memoirs is an excellent read. Even if you watched the mini-series (Band of Brothers) and didn't read the book upon which it was based (by Ambrose), this is an excellent choice. It is very well-written, fast paced, and you will be moved by the feeling Major Winters has for his men. It is also one of the best lessons in leadership I've come across."
4,Closure to a great story,"As a fan and admirer of Band of Brothers and Easy Company this book helps to bring closure to a great story of courage, honor, and heroism. While I would admit that the writing is not ""Pulitzer"" material, it doesn't have to be. This is written for those who have enjoyed the Band of Brothers story and wish to have some final thoughts from its vaunted leader. It does that in characteristic fashion with humility and honesty. The book reveals, at times almost serendipitously, true insights into leadership that apply across a wide range of professions. One cannot read this book without realizing that you are in the company of greatness. Highly recommended to those who appreciate the Band of Brothers story."
1,Beyond Band Of Brothers,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about Dick Winters and his experience with the 506 PIR in WWII. In the preface, Mr. Winters promises to tell the ""untold stories"" that presumably were left out of other books. Well, there are a few included in the overall text, but by and large it is the same information contained in ""Biggest Brother."" I came away from this book deeply disappointed. My advice: If you haven't made a choice yet, buy ""Biggest Brother"" (which gives a definitive history of the man) and skip ""Beyond."" ""Biggest Brother is infinitely better."
2,Didn't Come Across as Humbly as You'd Expect,"While this book did give a little more info on the events that were portrayed on Band of Brothers, the tone (or lack thereof) was offputting. It's a very dry book which makes me wonder if that's a reflection of the author.Yes, Winters is a hero and played a big part in World War II but I got tired of his smug arrogance when it came to his company. His comments on the Army Air Forces and replacements were really insulting. He made it sound like the only way to be a real man was to be a paratrooper. I beg to differ. My grandfather served with pride and honor as a sergeant in the Army Air Forces. He is just as much a man as Major Winters. But, nlike Winters, my grandfather volunteered out of a sense of duty not to avoid serving for more than a year."
2,"Over-promised, under-delivered","The introduction to this book promised new stories. What it delivered was largely a rehash of the mini-series. Dick Winters even comes across as somewhat boastful in this book, unlike the attractive humility he showed consistently in his TV commentaries."
1,More B o B Background/Details,"For lovers of the Band of Brothers ( B o B) Mini-series, Major Winters provides more background information and detail for the events shown in the series. Fortunately or unfortunately, some of it conflicts with what was put into B o B. I'm of the position that Major Winters accounts are more accurate and correct. This is a good read for WW II history buffs."
5,Amazon is Amazing,"I ordered a new release historical non fiction hardback book and purchased it through Amazon for a fraction of the bookstore price. I received it in a short time by mail. The book was new. I have become a regular customer of Amazon.The content of ""Beyond Band of Brothers"" is excellent. I appreciate that Dick Winterw took the time and effort to co author his biography of his acions during WWII. The book is easy reading and gives a direct, no frills account of the war from one of the few front line combat leaders that survived that most horrific American involvement in the war in Europe physically whole. To me, Major Winters is a true American hero.He fought that war from beginning to end. This is his story and how he saw it."
4,Beyond Band of Brothers: The War Memoirs of Major Dick Winters,A good detail narration of his days from Currahe to Points as depicted in the tv series and book. Plus a lot more detailed nit picky information on his days during the war. A good read and the cd book was even better.Highly Recommended.
2,Still admired despite this book,"I know this may be harsh, and if you are a fan of WWII, Easy, and/or Band of Brothers, this will NOT bring more in depth knowledge of E company, the characters in the book or the miniseries. The initial review of this book is correct, impersonal, and a re-hash of stories we've read/heard/seen, with no perceivable new perspective from Major Winters. Please know that I admire him as much as ever, but this book was ""unfulfulling"". Don't bother with this!!!!!!"
3,Beyond Band of Brothers,"Over all it was a disappointment. I thought he would go into detail about his experiences but it was a rehash of the Band of Brothers book except it had much less detail. He never gave you the feeling of being there and his thoughts as he was going through combat. He did cover his life after the war. Some of Amborse's books had the same problem, he never gets into specifics.Knowing the details is the most interesting part. You can get the overview from history books.Retired Naval Security Group"
5,Heroes,"Awsome book,Im a big WWII buff and I think this is one of the best books Ive read on WWII.These guys are the real deal.Get this book,you will love it"
3,oh kay,"a little different from the movie, just ok. had some things that was different, past the time away, would not be my first choice of war books"
2,Interesting Read,No new info on the Band of Brothers; just talking about himself. Worth reading but not very exciting.
3,"""Beyond Band of Brothers"" -AudioFile Review mistake","AudioFile got it wrong. Damian Lewis played Winters (very well I might add)in the HBO mini series and Tom Hanks co-produced it w/Spielberg. AudioFile must not have watched the HBO show or they wouldn't have got that one wrong in their review. Small potatoes, but geez, who's their fact checker and editor? Further confirms the limited use of a reviews especially by a ""critic"".I highly recommend reading Ambroses book then watching the series. I am looking foreword to reading Dick Winters book as soon as I get it in the mail. Cheers. KJM"
4,Dick Winters Band of Brothers,"This easy to read book gave an interesting and touching insight into the person who is Dick Winters, the true leader of Easy Company. I have enjoyed watching the series of Band of Brothers and found his book to be a valuable companion piece to that experience. Dick Winters and his men have my total and undying respect for their sacrifices."
3,Supplemental reading only,"I feel like a heretic, giving Dick Winters' story only three stars when I give both Ambrose's book and the TV miniseries, oh, ten stars. But as much as I was into the content, the choppy style was terribly annoying. I felt no ""flow"" in the narrative, which was why it took me about five or six sessions to finish it - where I read Ambrose straight through in one sitting. Like many ""believers,"" Winters is all too ready to ascribe anything good, up to and including his rifle aim, to his religious faith. Wonder how Muck and Pincala felt about that. And it seemed like he managed to cite, at one point or another, just about every soldier under his command as ""one of the finest soldiers I ever saw."" After about the tenth ""finest"" it kinda loses some power. But, hey, everyone else who reviewed this book said it was great, so maybe it's just me..."
3,Nothing new about Easy Company,"I have read ""Band of Brothers"" by Ambrose, ""Biggest Brother"" by Alexander, and ""Beyond Band of Brothers"". Beyond Band of Brothers is just a repeat of the exact pages, word for word, as the other two books. The book looks as if it was mainly copy/pasted from the other two for the most part. It is a good book, but if you are looking for more answers to your questions you may have, they are not in this book. I am not trying to take anything away from Mr. Winters, but I was not that impressed with this book. If you are a history and Easy Company fan, then read the book."
4,"A Companion To ""Brand Of Brothers""","Of the several books that have been written in relationship to ""A Band of Brothers, this memoir by Dick Winters looked like it would hold many interesting details."
4,Simple and easy to understand!!,"This book describes the microprocessor in a language which is so very simple and easy to understand.We have this book as a text book for the course in Microprocessors at the New York Institute of Technology. This was my primary reason to buy the book but once i began reading through it I found out that the language and the examples the author has used to describe the architecture and the working of the 188EB, is very uncomplicated and simple and reading the book is so much fun. For graduate students like me this book will definetely prove to be useful in understanding the subject of embedded microprocessors."
4,Great Embedded Book,"We use this book in the embedded systems design classes at the University of Wisconsin. I found it easy to read and had great example codes. There are some typos, and it doesn't cover everything, but it is a great beginner and reference book for the powerful 188EB chip."
3,Where's the Ending?,"I loved this book for most of its length. A little bit quirky, with its mix of monks, alternative theology of the afterlife, and quantum physics. Greatly enjoyed Jerome's journey. Until... it suddenly ended, no warning, no wrap-up. Huge disappointment, considering the other books in the series don't appear to be sequels. I'd suggest the author seriously consider adding a chapter or two."
1,Boring,"I really wanted to love this book but...after about half way through it, I realizedI couldn't even bear to finish it. It is the most long winded, drawn out, going absolutely no where, boring book I've ever read."
2,Good Idea,"This starts so well with a friar being killed in an accident and then reaches the afterlife, the idea is good and would work well if there was a plot that lead anywhere, unfortunately after this very little happens, it is a well written story with the characters and locations being well described but the story could almost be the day by day story of dead and alive friars and a cat that that can talk to the dead. The other thing that I do not like is that this seems to be a serial, I don't mind series where books can be read as a standalone but this one just stops and probably continues in the next of the books. I will read the next one but only if it is a free download."
4,And then there was a cat,"This is a mind bending book that challenged my conventional mind set. I enjoy that. I also am challenged by the unfinished way this ends, leaving loose ends and questions. Good stuff"
2,Wow? Why?,"I read this fluff in a couple of hours and am a fan of both christian writing and S.F./Fantasy, but not this book. I thought the story line had potential, but was marred by repetition and certain ideas which didn't seem logical. Eg, do you think we hold on to our pettiness, jealousies and idiosyncrasies in a heavenly afterlife?How many times do I have to read about how special the cat is? boh! I will definitely not be reading the follow up books in the series. If you have absolutely nothing better to do, the price is right."
3,Charm without Challenge,"This was a charming ""quick read"" sort of book, knitting together art, mythology, alternate universes, physics, a gentle take on conventional religion versus universalism, a bunch of kindly monks and a remarkable cat, in a sort of grown-ups' version of Narnia. Unfortunately, the book is a little bit in love with itself and its own cleverness, and badly belabored a key plot point by having three separate characters all laboriously ruminate on the same bit of puzzle and come to the same conclusion a la Schrodinger's Cat. Otherwise, while it's not a very challenging book despite all the interesting topics it knits together, it's a fun read filled with little puzzles and references to solve. It is lightweight in terms of action to balance internal dialog, could have more tension in the plot and lacks an ending. But it is a good 'palate refresher' for a mind weary of heavy literature, pleasant and will bring a few smiles to your face."
4,An Intelligent and Interesting Read,"I kept reading to see what would happen next and found the smoothly written prose addictive. Robina Williams manages to mix philosophy, religion and science in a readable style that produces a highly original story. She tells the story of Brother Jerome who dies unexpectedly after falling to hit his head on a headstone at the priory which is his home. He finds himself guided by the the priory cat, a seraph who mysteriously exists in both the worlds of the living and the dead. Jerome is a most lovable character and the priory a comforting place to imagine living, either in this life or the next one."
2,one more thing,"Adding to what John Cox wrote in his review: Not only does Mr. Sartelle assume Lydia's household included children and a husband, IF there was a husband Mr. Sartelle claims he'd have had to state his belief before being baptized. There is no statement of this in the Bible passage either. He also ignores the ramification (to his thesis)of the fact that in the Old Testament the covenant with the Jewish people included adult male servants of the believing member of the family. Whether or not that male servant was a believer is not addressed in the OT - but he still was Circumcised. If the OT covenant was totally shifted to the NT covenant the adult male servant would've had to state his belief."
4,Good Introduction to Hanukkah,"I had been looking for a book about Hanukkah for my 3-year old son to take to pre-school to share with his non-Jewish friends. I have looked at many and this one was perfect. It simply explains the story of Hanukkah and several of the traditions (lighting candles, eating latkes, playing driedel, etc.). The flaps also make it fun to read."
3,"Good, but could be better","I recently purchased and used this power roller and overall it work rather well. I should have listen to the previous comments about the edging attachment. It does not work well (at least they could have made it square to fit into and along corners better) and after having black marks and paint dripping onto the floor, I switched to the old realiable - the brush to do the inside corners and trim work. The roller did cut the paint time in about half - primed (both walls and ceiling)of a 22x14 room in about 2 hours. Cleanup did take about 45 minutes, but hopefully that will go down as I use it more and become more familar with how to clean it. I will use it again to paint the ceilings and walls of this room and any other larger room (trim work by brush), but for any smaller room or one with a lot corners and trim work I would probably do it the old fashion way."
3,Lots of flaws,Corner and edge attachments are useless. They splatter uncontrollably and create huge mess. It's easier (and cleaner) to use a brush for corners. Painting with a roller is a bliss - a real time saver. But fighting with a hose in process is not much fun. Cleaning is really the worst part of this. It takes at least 20 minutes and I could never get it completely clean. Replacement parts are expensive. Overall - too much trouble and mess. I think I'll stick with a manual roller and tray.
3,This is good a little too good if u know what i mean,"This paint applyer turned my drab apartment into a beautiful masterpiece of art. With a room once covered in drab white stark walls now has the handy colors of turcoise, hot pink and red all in one day where as if i did it by hand it would have taken me a week. Thanks power roller =)"
5,Favre: For the Record,"Wonderful, for those of us who are Packer-backers and even for those who aren't. Good history, honesty about his addiction."
4,An 80s Lover Must!,"As a huge fan of all things music from the 80s, I love these classic power ballad songs on one CD. While I like most of the songs, some of the ones they included were not that great(ex: ""Silent Lucidity"", ""When the Children Cry"") and could've been replaced by much better songs. I was surprised that Bon Jovi, Journey, and Motley Crue songs were not included as they were very successful during this time period. Overall, this was a good CD!"
2,Songs great..quality not so much.,"I absolutely love the compilation; however, I had to put the volume up to 28 on my JBL system in my car, just to hear the lyrics. The digital quality is terrible."
4,Dark side of microbiology,"This book covers the production and development of bioweapons in the Soviet Union. Reading the book is an unique chance to have a peek in the paranoid bureocratic society, in which production of mass murder technologies becomes a norm. In a way, the book is another example how ideological (in this case state sponsored) propaganda can subvert humans to do incredible, inhuman actions.The book is equally important as a warning for humanity of the self destructive potential of scientific knowledge when harnessed into usage as weapons of mass destruction.The book is written in readable, professional (from microbiologists viewpoint)and what appears a sincere way. It even seems that the book could be a part of a personal salvation process in which the author wants to deal with his past. I recommend the book for those intrested in soviet history/society, and especially for microbiologists and politicians who should get a deeper understanding of the issues covered in the book."
4,Chillingly blase--,"consider that he mentions smallpox, tularemia, brucellosis, anthrax, and a half dozen never-get-overs, and off-handedly supposes that there may be some chimera viruses currently in development. Given that we currently consider there to be a risk of the former USSR dealing in nuclear technology, we should be well and truly be concerned about what this man has revealed about the Soviet program--and what he may not have known about other areas where such research was done. Disease, BW/CW is the poor countries' nukes--this is a definite item of notice--a good read also for an insight into the last days of the Soviet Union and a picture of what lengths they would go to in order to cover up this program--the importance of it for military strategy."
3,more of a social history of the ussr,"I thought the book was interesting, and informative. But aside form the technological information, the insight into soviet social rank and interaction, was very interesting."
4,Good for the non-specialist reader.,"Alibek's personal story is very much along the lines of other defectors stories, such as Belenko, Viktor Suvorov and a number of defectors from the KGB and the GRU. They were talented people who were absorbed by the Soviet machine until an external event caused them to begin re-examining the system and eventually come to reject it. In this respect there is nothing new.The parts of the book that make it worth reading are his description of the Soviet/Russian biological warfare program and the scale of the effort, and the background that he gives on biological warfare agents. The reader who does not have a scientific background should find his expositions clear and come away wiser about the need to prevent proliferation of biological weapons and the problems associated with counterproliferation."
5,Chilling and Amazing All At Once,I loved this book. The way the story was told was clear and very very frightening! It's a real-life thriller about the Soviet Biological Weapons Program. It was almost hard to believe that so much is going on all around us and most of us aren't even aware of it. I highly recommend this book.
2,"Informative, but not well written",Information well received. Authors style of reporting was very boring
1,Boring autobiography of an evil man,"Why help support a man who has committed some of the worst crimes against humanity by creating strains of viruses that are specifically targeted against humans? Ken Alibek is an immoral, self-serving man. The book is terribly boring. His motive for writing the book is allegedly a plea for becoming more aware of the threat posed by bioweapondry-specifically the weapons he created, but only the last chapter weakly explores this idea. The book is mostly an insipid autobiography of a man with no feeling and no humanity."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Yet another attempt to cash in on 9-11. The fact is, bioweapons are extremely poor vector for mass destruction (compared to nuclear weapons), because of the dispersal problem: getting people infected with deadly disease is harder than it looks. The common cold virus, and other such viruses, are the exception that proves the rule--the reason they have survived over the years is because they do not kill their host. If they did (like Marbury virus, Ebola virus) they would not be around after a few generations.Also beware of any book written for the masses that ""reads like a thriller"". A warning sign.That said, any book that informs is worthwhile, so I would rate this book 2 stars for that."
2,Talk about a bomb!,"The author gives a narrative of events connected mostly by time and not drama. There is precious little detail about what chemical weapons can do to individuals or how they can be used tactically in a war. Rather he describes his rise in an organization dedicated to stockpiling weapons of mass destruction despite a climate of corruption and paranoia within the Russian government. His repudiation of his work came too late for me, and grew out of disillusionment with the Russian system rather than any moral epiphany. I say keep the author here but send the books back to the Kremlin."
1,I'd rather watch the grass grow,"It's hard for me to write a review, because I only read half the book. It was so poorly written that once I put it down, I never could pick it up again. If your kids are bad, make them read this book as torture. It's the only use I could find for the book."
4,Fascinating and Frightful,"This book should be required reading for those interested in bioterrorism. If you work in public health this is great for awareness level training, it's informative and entertaining."
5,Very Insightful and Knowledgeable,"Awesome book, read this over five years ago in it's original release ( bright orange cover ) and ever since, I have been looking for this."
5,Too bad it's not science fiction!,"This book reads like one of the scariest science fictionstories I have ever read... too bad it's science fact!In light of the recent attacks with military-grade anthrax,possibly from the author's lab, this book should be requiredreading for every concerned citizen and policymaker."
1,American purity,"The self congratulatory simpering which The New York Timesspecializes in, neglects to mention the Tuskegee syphilis experimentson black Americans."
3,A factual but not fun read.,"It many ways this is necessary reading in today's world. Lots of facts, but not a particularly passionate story. It's not a fun page turner. And the author's regret for the demons he created seems too late and too little. The book also ends in 1999 and is due for an update or adddendum. After reading this, one could make the arguement that if there was only a 10% chance that the Soviet bioweapons technology made it to Iraq, then the Iraq invasion was justified. The book is not an exciting or particularly good read; but it may be a necessary read."
5,"That was years ago, how about today?","This book reminds us of how crazy a nation could be in developing all sort of biological and chemical weapons to protect the country. Definitely, a must read for anyone! It keeps you alert that the world we live in is not that beautifull. The book described the biohazard program back in the cold war era, but who knows what it is now? I wonder whether the SARS outbreak was an accident from a covert Chinese bio-chemical research lab, much like the accident in Russia that was described in the book."
2,"Too many streams, not enough detail","I should have read reviews before purchasing this book but I assumed Charlie Meck would have something good here. I was dissapointed, apparently so has everyone else who bought this book. He adds very little detail to the streams he mentions, and he mentions a ton of them. I expected more, in the section regarding Bowmans Creek, which is calls at one time his ""home"" stream, he even gives an improper location of the Fly Fishing only section, the map is marked wrong, duh."
4,Great Book!,This is a must have book for Pennsylvania fisherman. We are North Central and use this book for streams in the area.
4,All you need to fish the right fly,The tables in the back are worth the price. Any remarks about too many streams are silly. It's a good book.
4,good information /but not as detailed,this book covered alot of streams that i hoped it would but i thought the information was not as detailed for each stream as i would like to have read.this book i feel still is a must for every PA. fly fisherman
5,The Journey of Psychic Development,"I found this CD informative and a positive reinforcement for my desire to learn more about psychic development. I believe we all have the ability to develop our psychic pathways, but it takes time and work. Once you open your mind, body and spirit to different pathways of thought anything is possible. This CD is a great way to get started. Ms. Decker's voice is very soft and well modulated. I found this CD a great inexpensive way to get started on developing a new sense of myself and the world around me. It is a great stress reducer too!"
4,Some good ideas but the rest is average,I'd say there are 4 to 6 great ideas in here that I took and added to a home made adventure. The rest was pretty much an excuse for hack and slash. Good maps and great details about the legendary names from Greyhawk.Would recommend but not highly recommend.
2,Headphones are non-adjustable,"The headphones that come with this product are non-adjustable. They curve over your ears and meet behind the head. I am only 5'1"" and the band of the headphones bang into the base of my neck and are very uncomfortable. Unfortunately the headphones are hardwired into the bottom of the unit, and so they can't be replaced with ones that fit better. The manufacturer says ""sorry, that's all we have."" Considering that this is their top-of-the line product, I am very unimpressed.If you are under 5'4"" don't buy this!The MP3 player itself seems to work fine, although sometimes it doesn't shut off immediately."
2,Average book - get's better as the book progresses.,"Just finished reading Max Ice. I'm a long time sci-fi reader and while I thought the book had a very interesting concept it suffered a few major flaws.1. Slow pacing the first half of the book.2. Needless confusion between ""Ice Nun"" and ""Ice Witch"".3. The usual contradiction of hi-tech surviving a post-apoc event. How can such a primative base of people maintain tech when they can barely read?4. A weak ending. The last two pages almost dribble into a sequel.5. Hanging plot threads left right and center. (what happened to other explorers, why would a planet sell a ship like this to persecuted people?, Dark Matter origin, etc. etc.)Having said all of that, the book does pose some interesting questions and it's not a bad read for a beach trip. Just don't expect more than that."
2,"good idea, poor execution","The premise is interesting, and some of the exploration of the premise is too. But there are too many places where a character does something uncharacteristic. Also too many things that stretch my suspention of disbelief. If the main source of food for ""the horde"" was buried reserves, then there would be no such thing as the horde after 10,000 years. After 10,000 years, any remaining hidden reserves would be extremely rare things, not something that could be mined steadily. That is just too big a fail to forgive."
2,Disappointing . . .,"I picked this book up because I thought the author might do a good job at creating the post-apocalyptic culture of Ice and its nuns described on the back. However, I was greatly disappointed in the actual story . . .Maximum Ice does the one thing authors should never do if they want to keep a reader's attention for a long novel -- it tells you what and who and why everything is basically within the beginning section of the book! What's the point of reading the rest if you already've been told everything? From that point on, the story just meanders on predictably and rather dully until all the not-very-interesting characters realize all the things the reader already knows. Very disappointing and certainly nothing new or interesting in the genre -- definitely not a keeper."
3,Sadly derivative Tepper-esque story,"I've just finished reading Maximum Ice, and was hoping for something significantly more off-the-wall and original, given I first found it on a Philip K. Dick award shortlist.Unfortunately, the book itself, describing the return of a Gypsy interstallar generational colony ship to an Earth covered in pseudocrystalline 'Ice' is extremely derivative and spends its time in shallow explorations of a couple of character interactions whilst quickly glossing over the technology and its implications. Disappointing, if you're a fan of Hard SF, but perhaps worthwhile if you've read everything else of note and are chasing a lightweight distraction. Read all of the Tepper books instead."
1,Interesting concept/Shallow characters,"A wandering tribe of Gypsies (the Rom) return from a fruitless 250 year star voyage to find the world covered with an intelligent crystal called Ice. The book follows the adventures of the women to pierce the meaning of the Ice and what it's done to the earth. Which is all well and good, but the author's writing style is very insecure throughout most of the book and the characters, especially the men, are one-dimensional at best. Ms. Kenyon has her fans and this should not disappoint. But advanced readers of SF might want to move on to more secure writers who have a better hold on the language."
4,Portrait of the Libertarian Ideal,"Oh, the story is silly and the writing is just OK, but the portrait painted of the Libertarian ideal is pretty well done. One can read this book and almost imagine living in a world where there are *really* no laws, except for those that *individuals* collectively enforce.Actual Libertarians tend towards two camps: Limited Government and No Government. Smith is in the latter camp."
4,Probability Broach is becoming a liberty clasic.,"I first read this book many years ago and it was one of many that helped to form my understanding of how a free society could function and some of the dangers that would face such a society. It offers compelling reason to think about what liberty means and what you could and would do to maintain that liberty. We fool ourselves sadly to think that we can have both liberty and unbroken peace. When liberty is sold to gain peace, we get neither one."
4,An interesting and thought provoking book.,"He makes you want to live in his world where freedom is real not just an outmoded concept. He presents history in a very interesting angle. What if this had happened then what would follow, he takes a step further and paints it in technicolor. An artist and teacher of vision."
4,Nice alternate reality but,"Would it really be that different politically if a few words and events were changed or would some people have continued clamoring for power and getting the popular support they need to achieve it. I suspect it happened the way it did because those people were the way they were, and genuine pro-liberty folk are few an far between.But it is sci-fiction. Weak characters, but fun ones - nice ways of presenting non-humans, but less than credible nowadays. Convenient simplistic ending but nice timeline included.Worth a read, good presentation of government free world especially in how personal protection advances in a free society, and mass destruction advances in a controlled society - put it on your paperback list."
5,One of the best SF novels of the hundreds I've read !!,"I've read this book at least 3 times in the last 10 years. If I wrote a book, this is one I would use as a guideline for great science fiction.One of the best SF/political novels of the hundreds of SF novels I have read. The interactions between the characters are on par with the best writing of Heinlein. I particularly loved the brief history of his ""slightly altered universe"" in the back of the book.A must read for any Libertarian."
2,"Impressive, imaginative ideas--unremarkable writing and story.","I read this a number of years ago. While I am 100% minarchist and libertarian, and have been so for 20 years, I found the writing and story unremarkable and unengaging. I don't read fiction much, but when I do, I expect to be swept away and totally engaged. This didn't really do it for me. Maybe for others it would. Maybe I've been so exposed to libertarian ideas that the ""marvels of a libertarian utopia"" didn't awe me like it would for other readers new to libertarian concepts. But I do agree with the premise, that life would be far, far better than it is now."
3,For Your Libertarian Library,"Heavy on its political agenda, and more than a little indebted to Phillip Dick and Sam Spade, ""The Probability Broach"" is entertaining but message-heavy. If you want a pure sci-fi alternate reality read, try Huxley's classic ""Brave New World"" - Smith's book won't survive the test of time quite as well."
4,Anarcho-captialist utopian novel in disguise,"There are layers of literary disguise in The Probability Broach. It's really an anarcho-capitalist utopian novel - but that's in disguise as a murder mystery, which is in turn masked as an alternate-universe science-fiction novel (the genre under which the book was marketed).As a utopian novel, it is a great success - probably the best fictional case for anarcho-capitalism ever made. Like all utopian novels, it sometimes sacrifices plot and character development in order to deliver its message - but you'll forgive it, because you'll enjoy hearing the message."
1,Ajusta Bubble,"The Ajusta Bubble worked great. After my first catch of a Striper Bass, the rubber tube came off the bottom of the bubble and there is no way to get it back on.Probably will not buy another, not at the current price. Works great, but not worth the risk!"
2,convoluted,"Gilroy's Black Atlantic is a much stronger piece. In many ways, this title ('Ain't No Black') seems to be working up to the conclusions he draws in Black Atlantic. Also, his writing in this work is not as strong as Black Atlantic. He could definitely use a decent editor who could take out all those extraneous prepositional phrases that he seems to LOVE. He could be a good deal more concise and coherent."
1,Not the product I ordered,I had ordered the body emulsion for my mother for Christmas as she recently received a sample and fell in love with it. What I received was the moisturizer for hands and body and nowhere on the bottle does it say body emulsion. It was a completely different product but the photograph and the information said that it was the body emulsion product. I wouldn't trust this company with this product at all.
5,"Engaging, Enlightening, and Easy to Read","The copy sent to me did have some negative notes of the previous owner, but that is the only flaw of the book. Spandel's writing is passionate and creates an urgency for the reader to teach writing in a different way."
2,Badly made.,The cardboard that you use is difficult to mess with. Its just a poor quality item. I would choose the one with an inflateable tube instead of the cardboard.
1,Junk,You get what you pay for this is junk threw it away. Couldn't get the mat to lay out flat so it was hard to put my puzzle together. Couldnt figure out the cardboard sleeve for rolling the puzzle up so overall would not recommend to anyone. Very disappointed.
2,not worth it,"It's not worth buying. It was much darker color than I expected so dark color puzzles will blend in with the mat. Please take into consideration the color puzzles you do and that the mat is darker than the puzzle before deciding if you want to buy it. I gave it a higher rate on educational value because kid's puzzles are more likely to be bright colored so it would be fun. I can't blame the seller for it being too dark and the seller did do well at sending it quickly but other buyers need to be aware that it is black, not green."
4,Quick ........hide the puzzle,Great storage for lareger puzzles that take up your kitchen table. It does not allow for a solid base when using on the carpet though. You still need heavy cardboard underneath. It worked out great for my daughter who is doing a large puzzle on it and like to go from room to room each day. The cost is very fair and we do reccommend it. Great idea and great gift to give to a puzzle lover.
1,Puzzle roll-up Mat,"I am very disappointed in this product. The permanent creases in the mat (I even ironed it to try to get them out) do not provide a good surface on which to make a puzzle. The pieces go up and down at each crease and fall apart. There was no way that the puzzles stayed in tact when I rolled it up. I bought three of these mats (two were supposed to be for future gifts. I cannot give them as gifts now, because they do not work."
4,"works fine, but not smooth","It works - I rolled up my puzzle easily and when unrolled, the puzzle was perfectly intact. Only complaint is that it is not as smooth as some other puzzle roll-ups I have seen, so it is a little bit annoying when you are trying to slide puzzle pieces around. But works fine for the price."
2,cheap!,cheap piece of thin felt with a cheap piece of cardboard. I could have made this cheaper myself!
3,Runs smaller....,"Donald J. Pliner is my favorite shoe line -- since they aren't cheap, I am careful when I buy them and own many pairs collected over the course of a few years.It should be noted that while most of Pliner's shoes run fairly true to size, the SASSY runs notably smaller. My suggestion is your order a half size up.In general, these are beautifully made shoes that last a long time -- and look quite good for a long time, a sign of real quality."
5,Use it as a cookie gun,"I'm a sugar cookie decorator and I use this gun to help seal some of the icing layers and decorations. I think it has done a good job of speeding up the wait time between different layers of icing. Also, I haven't noticed it making the icing discolored or splotchy.However, be careful that you don't put it on the highest level for too long over your icing! It will make it VERY HARD in just a little bit of time. I only use it on the lower setting for about 30 seconds while keeping it constantly moving and it doesn't change the texture of anything."
4,Does the job,I use it to apply shrink wrap to my soap products and it works fine on a low setting. I can't speak to how it works for removing paint or whatever a heat gun is mostly used for.
4,HOT!,"This heats things up pretty good, very quickly. Plenty of heat to do heat-shrink tubes or soften paint. My only concern is the lack of a cool down function, where the fan blows without the heat element on. As such it takes a while to cool down safely. That's definitely a desireable option, if I'd know this lacked that I'd probably have bought domething else."
4,Things were good,"I like the small form and it works really well for what I need. If you needed to heat something outside in the winter, this would not do the trick. But for everything inside, it's fine."
4,"SONY PS3 60GB ylod fixed, for 30 days","Affordable, well-built, 350'c option, a perfect heat gun for ps3 ylod fix. With isopropyl alcohol at about $7, I saved $120 if otherwise send my broken ps3 to SONY![Update 12/5/2010] PS3 60GB died again, although followed instruction exactly.Conclusion: SONY PS3 ylod can't be fixed."
3,not a great quality,not as strong as i wanm it did broke after a few months but it might be cause of my dropping and cooling with cold water.
3,No problems yet,It was cheap. That's why I bought it. I use it to heat up golf club heads to pull them off their shafts. I see potential for other jobs too. Always nice to have a heat gun around.
4,Great little inexpensive heat gun!,"I need a heat gun for working with plastic tubing for my fish tank, heating up clay for some art projects, and for working with vinyl on the car and motorcycle. This little guy handles it all very well. Heats up quick (learned the hard way) and seems to be solid enough to last so long as youre careful. The plastic body doesnt inspire confidence, but does the job. Definitely pleased with what I got and the price i paid!"
3,Nice but needs a stand,"This is a good quality heat gun. I would like to have a no heat option like in the hobbico heat gun, and it needs a stand to put it on your work bench without potentially melting whatever it may come in contact with. Overall a good functional gun."
5,Shrink Wrapping Soap,"I purchased this heat gun based off of great reviews, to Shrink Wrap Soap.Works perfect on low, to Shrink Wrap Soap.Love that it has a 2 year warranty."
5,good little heat gun,this little heat gun will do the trick. i purchased it for use on heat shrink tubing for eletrical connections. beats the orchhands down. i would buy again if needed. fast service and as described
3,"It works as advertised, but don't look for attachments or a holder","I bought this to use on shrink tubing for electronics.It works as advertised - has two settings (high and low) but what it lacks is some form of holder that can be used to hold the device while using, making it difficult to use when doing shrink tubing. It also doesn't have a 'cool down' setting that would make the metal tip cool off after using the unit, so you need to be careful where you place it (since it doesn't have a holder!) or you might melt or burn something.So far it is reliable and has worked as expected - probably a better tool for paint scraping than electronics though."
3,"Gets the job done, but for how long?","I bought this heat gun to fix my Playstation 3 (Yellow Ring of Death). It worked as it was supposed to for a short time, then it started to stall off and on. It does so when the power cord is stretched out, but works fine when the cord is not stretched out. It seems similar to problems that headphones tend to have; after a while, you can only hear out of one ear, unless you bend the cord in a certain position. This is due to general wearing and tearing to the wires that send information to the left and right speakers. However, I have not abused the heat gun in the least, hell, I've barely even used it, and already the wiring is failing. I would recommend this gun only if you need it for a one or two time job. The good news is that it did extend the life of my PS3, long enough for me to back up my save files."
1,"Poor reliability, poor support","I purchased a Wagner heat gun and used it only 5 or 6 times for less than 10 minutes each time over the course of two years.At that point, it became difficult to turn it on - it would start for a moment and then quit. After some googling, I found that the heat gun had been recalled. When I tried to contact Wagner at the recall number provided I was on hold for 1/2 hour and then dropped into voice mail. I left my number, but was never called back.If you want a throw away heat gun, something that will work for a short while and then quit, buy this product. If not, look at some other brand with better support."
1,I want my money back!,The box was crushed if it would let me attach a picture I would. It was all torn up. I'm supposed to give this as a Christmas present??!!? I piked the box up and the product just fell on the floor. No directions in it. Looks like its been used. Awful very upset.
2,Works Really Well Until it Breaks...Twice,"I use this type of Wagner heat gun at work and just recently it stopped working. It looks like we got about 10 years of heavy use from this device before it finally failed, and sometimes it was run constantly for hours at a time. I was very satisfied with the old model and just purchased a replacement, hopefully this one will last just as long.Update - After receiving the new gun I used it for 15-30 minutes and it stopped working. After taking the heat gun apart and measuring the electrical connections it appears the fuse SF240E blew. I replaced the fuse and the gun started working again, but two weeks later the same issue occurred. I had a great experience with their older products, but I cannot recommend the new ones to anyone. After searching a bit it appears this problem is common so I would invest in a different brand."
4,feels cheap but get the job done,I bought it for working with heat shrink tubes. The heat gun feels cheap but it works fine. hope it can last for a while.
4,Heats stuff up,"Has two settings : Hot and hotterI used it to remove decals from my plastic fairings, worked like a charm."
5,Just what I needed,This heat gun already paid for itself after the first ipad I fixed. Just be careful touching the tip of the heat gun to anything.
1,If you're looking for multiple timer functions in a 24hr period - this isn't the timer for you,"Purchased this timer to turn on lights in the early morning and at sunset in our home. After purchasing and subsequently receiving this timer, I discovered this timer can't be programed to operate more than one program daily.I tried to contact the distributor, but soon found that their customer service hours were 8a-4pm EST. Inconvenient to say the least.When I received a follow-up email about the timer purchase, I asked how to return the timer. I never received a response. My telephone inquires haven't been answered. I'm sure a negative review draw some interest.Save yourself the trouble, and buy any other timer but this one if you want to perform more than one function daily. The sunset option, set to your area cose, not zip code as the name leads you to believe, works great. Its an expensive timer for only one daily function."
1,Warning -- Limited Functionality,"This product is awfully confusing to program -- you'll need somebody with a degree in science to figure out how to program it. Once you figure it out however, you'll soon realize that the worst feature is, the manual program mode allows you to set four different times, but only one can run at a time. So if you want to run your lights from 6am to 9am, and then from 7pm to 11pm, you can't -- only can run one of those times. This is a highly complex piece of junk."
3,GOOD... BUT,"I have several of these. I travel and if the power fails when I am away these are smart enough to keep the time correct when the power comes back on. I love the fact that I dont have to reset the timers as the seasons change, they automatically adjust the on time to dusk year around. However the LED displays fail after a few years and I have to replace them, and at $26 that's expensive. I havent found anything I like better"
4,Works Pretty Well,"Works pretty much as advertised, although it comes on about 45 minutes too early. It was easy to set up, using area code."
1,zip set lamp off too limited,"If I had know that when using the Zip Set that I could only turn off the lamp only a certain specified number of hours after sunset I never would have purchased this timer. Sunset changes year round, but I want to shut the lamp off at 10:30pm every night and that is not an option with zip set."
2,24 hour indoor timer,"I followed directions for set up which are not that clear. I got it to work after talking with the dealer, after about 3 left messages. When I talked to him before I bought it, he said the item was made in the USA! Well, it isn't! I have had it about a month now & it has only come on twice. I haven't had time to see if I have a LEMON or what the problem is. If I were buying now, I would wait & check out many more on line then I did. This one sounded to good to be true & it is. I had a Timex for years before it recently gave out & it only took a minute to set it & it always worked."
3,It's okay,"Maybe because of the stories I've heard (perhaps false), this book wasn't what I expected. Yet, it's worth reading and interesting. But I was expecting more about her addictions and struggles."
4,A good read!,This is a good story by Betty Ford of her life from the beginning up to the end including life in the White House.
5,Great Kid Movies,My 2 year old is in love with Miss Spider. This was a great movie because it explained how the kids were adopted. I didn't know this and always wondered. Awesome Movie!My 4 year old loved Stellaluna. It's a very cute story.
1,Half-truths About Ronald Reagan At Only ONE Of His Ranches,The Young America's Foundation has put together a bunch of half-truths in this dvd to promote their own organization financially by attributing ony a small part of Ronald Reagan's life to the Republican Party. There was much more to Ronald Reagan than what this dvd purports to be his life at Rancho Del Cielo.
3,Nicely written but wrong.,"I really enjoyed the reading untill I find that: Hector(Rigel)is killed in ""the fleshy part of the neck""(p.76). This stars is actually located in the left knee(p132-231). The stars presented in the neck is Heka. It is really unfortunated that the ""arche-type"" is so confuselly handled."
4,no reactions,As with all bulk style grain purchases I was concerned about gluten cross-contamination. We had no problems with this product.
4,Key to popping,The key to any popping is high temperture oil!!!I have puffed many types of noodles and popped many kinds of seeds.You need the right oil. Google high temp cooking oil and get it to the point where it is starting to smoke just a little.At that point you put in the grain and POP it goes.
1,horrible,don't buy these unless you really want to waste money; taste horrible and trying to pop these in place of corn was a joke
3,Did not know how to use it,I am giving the sorghum a three only because I did not know how or what to do with the product. There was no instructions sent in with the product. I wanted to make popcorn out of them but I did not know how much oil or how much time or on what heat setting. I tried several times and it was a complete failure. My girlfriend was waiting to see how it tasted before she ordered some. It was too hard for us to figure out on our own so now I have a bag of sorghum siting in my cabinet taking up space. Anyone out there know how to pop sorghum?
1,sorghum hocus pocus,"A wasten of money and time. We tried air popping--no more than 5% popped. we tried skillet popping--same. Have yet to find it already popped in bags--maybe that will redeem it, but not return my wasted time and money. Birds and squirrels seemed to like it."
3,Use caution if this is your alarm clock,I have used two of these radios for about a year and have had no hardware problems. Like everyone else I wish the menus were a little easier to use. My primary gripe is the clock. The clock set's itself from some time source on the internet but every few months the time automatically resets to something a few hours off the correct time. It's as if the time zone was changed remotely. This change can occur any time thus causing the alarm to come on in the middle of the night or hours after your intended wake up time. The time is easily fixed by unplugging and replugging in the radio to do a reset.
2,Died 22 months after purchase,"I really loved this radio - never had a problem until suddenly it died - no power. In checking Roku forum this has happened to many people, some within a short time after purchase. Roku will replace mine for 199.00, but might be refurbished. A radio this expensive should last longer than 22 months. Caveat emptor!"
1,Another one bites the dust,"Good while it worked, beware of this product, from what I've seen it has a bad problem with power supply dying, which happened to mine, of course after warranty period - poor quality.Roku SoundBridge R1000 Radio Network Music System"
3,Good net radio but has reliability issues,The Soundbridge has good sound and worked well with my upnp setup for about 10 months. Then it stopped coming on. Since it was still under warranty I was able to get a new unit. The new unit also ran about 10 months before it too failed in the same way. I will not be getting another one of these.
5,Very Impressed with Sound and Features,"Very few disappointments with this item. Sound is incredible for such a small system, access and listen to many thousands of internet radio stations. Needs more presets and sound shaping options, but I'm pretty thrilled with it ""as-is"". One nice feature is that Roku releases software updated once in awhile that add new features and fix bugs. Unfortunately, so far, they don't take customer suggestions very seriously (on their forum.roku.com page). Overall, pretty happy with this device, but still have a few complaints."
5,I love this radio,I'm thrilled with the Roku Soundbridge System. The sound is great. I can listen to my Itunes playlist as well. The quality is excellent. If you want to listen to AM you probably will have to purchase an antenna. I definitely recommend this product. The downside: certain stations are not available (most BBC stations and I believe US stations that have syndicated shows).
1,Loved at first...but then poor quality changed that,"Summary: You are much better off buying a Logitech Squeezebox.I loved my Roku at first but then the power supply went out. I searched online and found that this was a known issue impacting tons of people. Since my radio was out of warranty, Roku wouldn't help. I wouldn't be that upset if it was a one off thing but apparently this is a known issue that has users talking about a class action lawsuit. Best to avoid this product and this company."
3,"a good Internet radio, but ...","I've had my Roku radio for over a year and still use it daily. No reliability problems so far, but it does lose the correct time occasionally and has to be rebooted.My main problem with this radio is that Roku hasn't upgraded the software and firmware for at least a couple of years. Features that may have worked at one time, such as synchronization with the Logitech Squeezebox, now don't work at all.If you want a basic Internet radio with reasonably good sound, this is still a good product. Before you buy one however, shop around a bit. These can often be found at a considerable discount."
1,No support,The Roku Soundbridge is a great concept sold by a company with absolutely no support. I found that communication between Roku and my stereo system was difficult. Storing new stations on my Roku was impossible. My unit even arrived with instructions in French. There's a mint to be made by someone who can make a product like this work simply and provide customer support.
2,Power supplies do not last,"During my second year of ownership, the power supply stopped functioning. I found that many other owners of this radio have experienced the same problem. Some of them found a source that will fix the units for around $100. I decided to use my $100 and purchase another type of Internet radio instead. I now have a Chumby, which I am enjoying more than I did the Roku."
2,Not quite good enough,"I have been through two Roku Soundbridges, the first one died after 1-1/2 years, the second after another 2 (both past warranty). The first time the unit died, and I had it replaced at considerable cost, the second time the sound quality deteriorated badly, so I agree with the other reviewers that there are quality problems with this unit. I did like the interface although the sound was a bit boomy and soft. Anyway, I have given up and switched to the Squeezebox Boom and so far it has a much better quality sound. It was a nuisance having to learn another interface but I got over it. I'll have to wait and see if the Squeezebox boom holds up. Too bad Roku, it was good while it lasted."
2,Unit Dead after 15 months,I have been very happy with this unit - I waited for this unit thinking they had solved the power supply problems witht this later unit. It failed about 2 days ago.This is really inadmissable and just NOT on.I have emailed Roku and we will see if they have any fix for this.
1,Roku Soundbridge R1000,"Do not - I repeat - do not buy that thing. The power unit died after one year and Roku wrote me that they don't have replacement units any more. The power unit is in a sealed box together with the bass loudspeaker. So, forget it. Look at the Roku forum: many people have the same problem."
4,If only it had outputs...,"This is a great appliance, easy to install, and does everything they say it does. BUT...there are no outputs so it can not be connected to external speakers or to a music system. If it had just two RCA jacks, it would be a fiver for sure. There are less expensive devices on the market that will do the same thing however, the R1000 acoustics is excellent."
5,Unbelievably Good,"I've owned this radio for about a week. It is a pleasure to use. The audio is fantastic. I think the sound is comparable to my Bose Wave Radio- this unit has excellent base as well. Everything worked right out of the box with absolutely no issues. In addition to being programmed with some good internet radio stations, it is very easy to play MP3 files, podcasts from iTunes right on this radio using wireless technology."
1,"Short-lived, compare to Squeezebox Boom","This worked well while it worked, but that was only two years, and Roku have ignored queries about repair.We replaced this with a Squeezebox Boom. The Roku has extra resonance in the bass that tends to make music more pleasant but speech less intelligible. The Roku will play louder than the Boom. Each of them is more awkward to use than the other."
1,Look for something else!,"There are 3 real BIG problems with this radio.1. The BIGGEST problem with this radio is the LACK of/no support from ROKU. It's pretty much an orphan product.2. Certain feeds cannot be played and with no support will probably never work. For example, KFI in Los Angeles.3. The power supply WILL go out eventually. It can be repaired but not by ROKU.It's unfortunate that ROKU abandoned this product because it is really a nice radio.I suggest looking at Logitech Squeezebox Radio as an alternative."
1,Buy only if you're very lucky.,"I've had the Soundbridge R1000 for two years and enjoyed it very much until it completely died like many others. Roku customer service can not be had, might as well throw it away. This has been the worst customer service experience I have ever had. It makes me wonder why Amazon would even sell this item when it will not be supported."
1,Poor quality components,"Worked great for over a year and then died completely. The support forums are filled with people with bad Roku's. The power supply goes bad because cheap components were used to manufacture them. Considering how much this thing cost, I'm extremely disappointed. I opened a support ticket 9 days ago and Roku still hasn't responded. When you call their support phone line, it refers you to the website which they apparently don't answer.Unless you are ultra rich and can afford to buy a new one every year, I recommend you avoid this product. Why does Roku think so little of their customers?"
2,Not as reliable as the M1000,"I've been a big Roku fan for more than 3 years. I have M1000s in the living room and den, so when I decided to add another to the bedroom the R1000 looked perfect (small footprint, built in speakers, etc.)Unfortunately, I had the same problem as others have posted -- a little over a year after I bought it, it just stopped working. I contacted Roku by email, tried calling them and got no response. On the other hand, the M1000s have been working twice as long and I haven't had any problems with them.All in all a great radio while it worked -- but a very expensive brick when it stopped."
1,"Not Reliable, Poor Warranty","When it is working my Roku Radio R1000 is a great product. Unfortunately, based on my experience and information on the Roku internet forum ([...]), there is a real chance your radio will stop working after about a year. The warranty is for 1 year. If your radio dies out of warranty you are out of luck.Mine died after 15 months, 3 months out of warranty. Roku wants $[...] to replace it with no guarantee the replacement will last longer than the original. I don't think the risk and hassle are worth it.I commend Roku for their openness about the problem on their forum. I'm dissapointed they are not working harder at supporting their product."
1,bad mono recording from 1969 (?!),luckily i got this out of the library before buying it... i won't speak to the performances (as i didn't listen after the first few minutes)... i guess the performances ARE pretty good or there would have been no earthly reason to release this...i've heard better sound quality from recordings made in the 40s...
4,Handy.,"While this particular collection DOES have a lot of interesting ideas, I find that if you own the Van Richten's Guides, you're better off creating your own beasts. Still, this DOES contain a great deal of information, and shouldn't be passed up if you can get it for a reasonable price."
5,Very Best Of Chill Melodies,"""The Very Best Of The Chillout Session"" consists of a two cd set with twenty songs each. The following are some of the calming and satisfying hits in this collection:""Here With Me"" by Dido,""6 Underground"" by Sneaker Pimps, ""Strange and Beautiful"" by Aqualung,""Eple"" by Royksopp, ""Strict Machine' by Goldfrapp, ""No Letting Go"" (summer mix) by Wayne Wonder, ""At Night"" (Afterlife Remix) by Shakedown, ""Another Chance"" (Afterlife Mix) by Roger Sanchez, ""Deepest Blue"" by Deepest Blue (John Hopkins Mix), ""I'm In Heaven"" (Jason Bye Remix) by Jason Nevins and Holly James, ""Heaven"" (Candlelight Remix) by DJ Sammy & Yanou, ""So Damn Beautiful"" by Polaroid, ""Rapture"" by Illio.Amazon UK has the full track listing for both cds. ""The Very Best Of The Chillout Session"" is best for those who enjoy songs that blend electronic and chill-out music."
3,Beautiful but bad handling,"Beautiful coffee table...Good quality, the wood shines and has a really nice color. Stunning..BUT once we putt it together we realized there were scratches all over. One of them is huge and looks horrible and after you put it together you don't feel like dealing with sending it back."
5,What a cool discovery,"Great production, torchy voice, strong country songs. This Austin based gal may not get a lot of attention from mainstrean ""country"" radio, but it's one of the best new CDs I've heard this year.Roger CoryellTwangCity.com"
4,DVD: Notting Hill/Erin Brokovich,Both movies are entertaining. I especially liked Notting Hill. I had seen it many times and just wanted to have it in my collection.
5,Great Classic,"Julia Roberts never lets you down in these two great movies. Notting Hill is always a ""feel-Good"" movie. Erin Brokovich is good too!"
3,Excellent Movie,"This movie was fantastic, however the seller I purchased from was incredibly slow and when my product did actually arrive 3 weeks later, it was in a crappy plastic bag and the case was broken. Luckily the DVD inside was fine, but this was not the quality I expected. Especially when I noticed a few days after purchasing the item that I could've purchased it new for much cheaper at a local store. The movie is fantastic though, I love Julia Roberts and she shines in Erin Brockovich."
3,it's okay,"after running across this cd while browsing, i was impressed with the line up of people involved with this project. people from cluster, guru guru, kie krupps, amon duul ii and faust. i was expecting some very different material with such a diverse line up. and the cleopatra label can come up, from time to time, with some interesting compilations. this one isn't it though. as much as i wanted to like this, i find it average at best, redundant at worse. mani neumeier on percusion is probably the most notable person on this release. the music is long, drawn out, and it really doesn't go anywhere. i believe there is much room for improvision, but for some reason, no one picked up on those cues. no liner notes or information about this session either. get it if you are a completest, but just don't expect much."
4,useful and thoughtful,"Blessedly not an angry feminist treatise, but a helpful, thoughtful exploration of how to represent God in modern liturgy without sexualizing and distorting our image of God. Recommended for anyone struggling to name, identify, or describe God in Christian worship."
1,This book ...,"This book is not supported at all. The references are incorrect and outdated and the languauge is written in the most complex way possible, it is pretentious."
5,Couldn't put it down!,I enjoyed this book immensly. I looked forward to reading it everynight and didn't want to stop reading. I felt inspired by the story of Handel and loved the way Mr. Featherstone was able to put the music into the words of each chapter.
3,"Beautiful story, poorly written","This is a compelling story. Handel's life is the stuff of rich drama, and the coming forth of the Messiah is a miracle. Unfortunately, the writing here doesn't match the material. I kept reading because I loved the story of Handel. It would have been better if Mr. Featherstone had stuck to a non-ficiton account with a good editor. The fictional characters were not fully realized; they were sentimental stereotypes. The story is worth the read but one has to skim through quite a bit of dross to find the gold."
5,Sharon,Loved this book. Loved the descriptive prose that as it described situations throughout. Enjoyed the story once I got to where the characters began to interact. I would recommend this highly to anyone who enjoys music.
4,Hallelujah,"The book arrived and was fine. If one sentence is not enough I will likely not write many reviews, so you will not get many reviews from me."
1,"Oh, please!","Needs so much editing, it is laughable. The writing is uneven, overblown and in spots, completely inconceivable. Peaches in March, in London? I suspected it was published by a vanity press, and boy, was I right! The editors must have slept through this project."
3,Outlasted the phone I bought it for,"As it turned out, this did not fit my camera , so I used it for a phone. I did not have the model it was made for. The product was fine. The magnetic closure was really handy. It frayed around the edges after a couple of years of being tossed around my handbags and the floor of my car."
2,not powerful,"This is the second Wagner Ist one stop working the first day i used it. The second one takes a while to get to the temp to strip off the paint , also the hot air is to consentrated even with the wide nozzle to do a project in a timely fashion. I find a liquid stripper is better but it to is costic."
1,Didn't work for paint,"This device is packaged as a paint removing tool on the box, so I expected it to work at least middling-well. It did not.Our bathroom was painted in latex over oil without a primer before we moved in, so we need to remove it to start fresh since it currently peels off. This heat gun wasn't able to loosen the latex layer much at all, even on high. By the time it softened enough to smear it around (not even to release), the smoke alarm was screaming bloody murder. It was a complete waste of time."
3,OK,First time I've purchased a heat gun. Wasn't impressed with the performance but don't have a frame of reference. I bought it to try to pop out some dents in a garage door and it didn't work. Not blaming it on the gun. Might have been the advice.
4,Worlds Afire,"The book Worlds Afire is the best drama book I have ever read but since I'm only 13 I'm sure that there is a lot more better drama books out there I just haven't heard of yet. This book is about ""a circus gone bad"" as I would say. It is also a true story that is going to haunt my dreams for the rest of my life. That's how good of a picture the book draws for you as you read. As your reading you can just see all the people dying in the torturous flames of the Hartford fire. The book takes place during the circus act of the tigers. The worst thing about the fire is that there is only one escape for all those people to get out of and barely half of them did. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone shape, color or size."
3,Sally Weissman...the Nurse,"Paul Janeczko's collection of poems tells the story of the infamous Hartford Circus fire of 1944. From the gradual points of view of performers, parents and anxoius children, Janeczko leads his readers through the excitement of the Big Top event, to the horror and tragedy of the fire. From parents, freaks and photographers, the reader is lead through the terror and confusion of the fire and the anguish of the hospital afterward. The best poem in my opinion was not saved for last. The touching point of view of sally Weissman, the nurse attending the emergency room to which so many victems were rushed is this books most powerful moment."
2,Worlds Afire,"I am very excited about the new format of books written in poetry, some of my favorites being ""Love That Dog"" and ""Shakespeare Bats Cleanup."" However, both of these are fictional stories and the format really DOES NOT work for non-fiction.The poems feel uninspired and would have been much better expressed in, say, a historical fiction novel. Also, the book offers us no real information about the fire or the circus.If you would like to get books written in poetry, please check out ""Love That Dog"" by Sharon Creech or ""Shakespeare Bats Cleanup"" by Ron Koertge. Don't even bother with this one."
3,CIRCUS FIRE PUT TO POETRY,"Each chapter here involves a character from the fire and the poems tell the story from that point of view. Characters include performers, policeman, children, an usher and even, the alleged arsonist himself. Every poem adds detail to the events of that hot July day.I am not fond of mixing poetry with disasters, and the author is no Whitman, but the book is far from hopeless. If you are interested, and can get a cheap copy, it will probably be worth your while."
2,not too true,Even though I like Jeff Goldblum he is not Ernie Kovacs. I think they could have found a different and better actor to play him.I guess it is ok but I've seen much better true story movies.
2,Let down,Not very helpful. Way too generic and focused on mechanical/electrical engineering. Being a civil engineer I don't find it very useful.
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"Other web sites may praise this reference as a must for the PE exam, but I did not find any words in this book that would have helped me on the exam. ..."
1,Not a Good Civil Engineering Dictionary,"I purchased this dictionary to take the PE Civil Test. It is the worst reference I have ever purchased. None of the terms I was looking for were in it. It may be good for other diciplines, but do not buy it for the Civil part of the Professional Engineer test!"
2,Not for use on the PE exam,I purchased this book so I could use it on the Professional Engineering exam. This book did not provide the relevant definitions I was hoping it would have. I would reccomend looking for a different book.
2,Only includes the most common engineering terms,"This dictionary contains many common terms, but if you are an engineer and are looking for a word you don't already know, you will not find it here. I bought this book to take with me for the PE exam, there were a few words on the exam that I was not familiar with, none of them were in this dictionary."
2,Not for Civil Engineering!!!,"The dictionary appears good enough for others, but not for Civil Engineers. The first four things I looked up weren't even listed (""plug flow,"" ""wastewater,"" ""footer,"" and ""load bearing wall""). The definition for ""effluent"" is pretty poor as far as I'm concerned.This will go up on the shelf, but I'll be surprised if gets used much. Glad it was less than $15!For Civil Engineers it is 0 stars. I gave it 2 stars because other engineering fields may still find it useful."
4,hungry for zhiguai ^__^,"Dr. Strassberg has done some intensive researches on the zhiguai genre as well as the Chinese Travelogue tradition (the two in fact has a germane connection). This book is to provide you with a collection of pictographs of the strange creatures from Shan Hai Jin, an eerie...no, no, no sacred book about the landscape of si-hai (four seas) and jiu-zhou (nine provinces) of the middle kingdom (ancient China). I have both of his two books (this & Inscribed Landscape) and will be more than happy to recommend them to anyone who either has an interest in the study of ancient mythology, Chinese literature, or the so called ""sacred geography"" of eastern mysticism.:)"
5,A beautiful book,"Both content and packaging are excellent. A perfect complement to Borges ""Book of Imaginary Beings"" and a great spur to creativity if you happen to write fantasy."
3,Great Collaboration,This book has an amazing collection of great stories that can be read on lunch. Thank you
2,Not What I Expected,"In the 13th chapter, Mr. Leightner states that he doesn't think that God can see our future actions. He says,""It is nonsense that God should know in advance exactly what mankind would do, and then be grieved or angry when they do it, to the extent of being sorry that he had even created man."" This is so unscriptural that I felt I had wasted time reading the first 12 chapters."
5,Wonderful,"This book arrived shortly after i ordered it, and is in Like New condition,(as it was listed.)There is a small crease at the bottom of the cover, and it has been autographed to someone named ""Gene"". I havent read it yet, but i'm sure i'll learn from it seeing as i've owned the 1st edition since it's release. I'm just now finding out there was a ""2nd"" edition."
1,"TAVIS, SHUT UP!!!!","Tavis Smiley rides on the backs of a group of celebrated African American intellectuals to line his own pockets and further advance his multi-media, empty talkfest. This young man babbles and blaters without much substance, but turns out the crowds becasue of his overexposure both on BET and on Tom Joyner's show. Listen to Tavis if you must, watch him if you will, but buying this book is both a waste of time and encouragement to an already shallow talker that keeping it light is all right. If you are going to buy one book, buy Randall Robinson's The Debt. Or check out Farai Chidea's most recent work. But this is fluff (for example, Tyra Banks implores us to all. . . .(is that get along, Tyra or did they only allow you half a page), nothing more. It plays the black community cheap."
3,How to Make Black America Better,"The worksmanship of this piece was excellent. The author did an exceptional job at crafting the book and composed it in readable words. However, though being put together considerably well, the message put out by Mr. Smiley's book is one that creates much controversy. This is simply one point of view, among many."
5,I was hooked when I saw the guy on the cover ...,"...he looked like my grandpa. My mother called my grandpa a drunk liar and I guess he was, anyway I liked his stories and I liked the ones I read in this anthology. They were gritty and real, like Dashell Hammit. I enjoyed the poetry, too. There are lots of different voices coming from lots of different angles. Kind of a cubist literature, a cubaliture, litaracube, a bistacubature."
5,Works Great if you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!,Painter works great for SMALL projects. Used it to paint 1 wall in our house and it worked great. Make sure you cover everything as there is overspray and wear a mask. Great item!
1,needs to be rengineered,"paint cup leeks badly needs gasket,spray nossel pops out ,i made mod. to stop this ha ha ....i have applied for a pant. to modify your product........."
2,Very disappointed,"With the high cost of renting a power paint sprayer, I was really hoping that this product would be able to help me paint my projects economically. Unfortunately, even though I've followed the directions perfectly, I have encountered so much splatter that I might as well have used a manual roller--especially considering that I'll have to use one anyway to roll out the many splatters. On the plus side, the sprayer is not that difficult to clean. I'll keep this sprayer and use it for small projects only. But I definitely won't be buying any other Wagner products."
1,Half a Room,"I bought this sprayer with the intention of painting my apartment to receive my deposit back. I started in my bedroom, and the sprayer was very loud. I used it on half the room and then it quit spraying. There was plenty of paint in the backpack, and it was thin enough. I ended up paying $60 to go rent a sprayer. That one ( a professional grade) was quiet, and very fast."
2,Not for any job larger than a bench.,"I purchased the model with a back pack since I had to repaint two exterior walls. In summary, the unit will work fine as long as you have a small job for which the integrated paint reservoir is adequate. For any larger job, the unit is useless for three reasons. First, the back pack is the cheapest piece of equipment seen in recent memory: the shoulder straps attach to the clips securing the cover, which as a result comes off repeatedly. Second, paint will dry in the hoses before the job is done. Third, the unit does not work very well with thick primers."
5,Magical,"I found this in a car wash where they were selling it at a steep discount. Hard to tell why as it is well-made and of fine quality. I slipped it onto my car key ring. Serendipitously, the wings just touched the ring. When I started my car, the vibration travelled down and you could hear what sounded like small wings flapping! Now, this small event brings a smile to me every morning."
1,Not worth it,"Buy another book on Technical Analysis. This book is very simplistic, a basic overview. Not even a Book ! not sure on why they even printed it. its really a booklet. Would have been an ideal sales promo tool. they could have issued it for free to whet your appetite, then used the pages in the back with the ads for their other products, to increase sales. its worth looking at only if it was FREE. a bit of rip-off and waste of time/money in my opinion"
4,"""No, I'm swedish..""","A trigger-happy swede roaming around mexico with his not-so-bright ""compañero""?? Yeah, sounds about right to me.. :)Ignoring this, Compañeros is a good eurowestern. Franco Nero is really cool in this movie, and even gets the chance to hook up with his old buddy Mr. Machinegun towards the end. Jack Palance does a good job as the sleazy crook you really want to see dead. If you haven't seen this movie already, now would be a good time."
2,Companeros,"This is a nonsense, no-redeeming-value spaghetti western. I watched the whole thing because I just KNEW it had to get better. It didn't. Loved the music though, Ennio Morricone has really captured 'violence, emptiness and despair' in his music. This movie is for Ennio Morricone fans."
4,"My review of ""Grover's Mommy.""","I read this book for my Junior English class. This book wasn't bad. The book was about Grover mentioning what his mom is good at. The book is pretty short, so a young child won't loose insterest before you finish it, and there isn't too many words per page. I thought there was a few large words that some younger kids wouldn't understand, such as mechanical genuis. Over all this book wasn't too bad, and I think a young child would like it."
5,The finest set of Military History by an Expert,"The trio of books on Military History of the Western World, written by one of the very top Military Historians of our time, is indeed a ""must have"" in a library of the same genre. It is lucid, well-paced, and filled with historical information with insides and critiques on the issues of the time(s) and pulls no punches relating errors and bad decisions made, avoiding taking sides for the most part. A superb effort, highly recommended without reservations."
4,Great book,Fuller offers an insightful blend of battlefield detail and the broader causes and effects for each engagement presented. He avoids one of the major shortcomings I have with a lot of other military history authors: bogging the reader down in pedantic minutiae.
1,Missing String,"I bought my GF a guitar for Valentines Day and I decided to get her some good strings for it and some picks and stuff so she can learn to play. The strings and stuff came together in a timely manner. Imagine my surprise when I opened the strings and one is missing, I don't know a lot about guitars but I know they have 6 strings lol. I just won't buy strings on amazon.com I was being lazy and didn't want to pay taxes on them lol. I will just go to my local music store next time."
5,My Bible,"I discovered the book when I was a sophomore in college. Everyone needs a road map and plan to achieve in life. While my father was a fantastic role model and working man (Bethlehem Steel Corporation for 49 years). I still needed to understand the depths of what it means to be a man. The book was a journey and discovery in one passage. THE DEFINITION OF BLACKMANHOOD page 16. To this day, I give the book to young African American males who are finding their way out of high school and into college in hopes that they will find their way into the true light of what being an African American man in America."
5,Excellent book,"I read this book in 1994 when I was a young teenager attending Villanova University on an academic scholarship. I grauated from an inner-city High School in Philadelphia and attendied this affluent White Private school which was a difficult transition. However, after digging and delving into brother Haki's work made it easier. I later met Haki in 1998 at a Black bookstore in Philadelphia where he was conducting a lecture. After the lecture we conversed and I explained to him that the Bible, Quran and his book Black Men, truly had a profound impact on my life and if it were not for all 3 I'm not sure if I would have graduated from this institution."
2,often outdated,"When some years ago I was given by an American friend of mine a copy of this guide, I soon noticed that many information (e. g. telephone numbers of museums, names of bus companies) on the area in Tuscany where I live were outdated. So I wrote the authors a short letter with new numbers, names etc. Two weeks ago I saw the 6th ed. of the guide in a Florentine bookshop, but the wrong numbers, names etc. were always the same! They were not corrected!!! I wonder why!"
1,misleading information,"This American version (Globe Pequot) of the much lengthier, more recently published British edition of the Cadogan Guide to Tuscany, Umbria, and the Marches was a real disappointment. It was in good condition--but it was published in 1990 and is too old to replace the well-worn, much more informative guide I've used for several years while travelling in Tuscany and Umbria.After I got the guide, I went onto Google.uk and found that a much more recent version is available in the UK."
1,These are huge!!!,"i just bought these for my daughter who will be 4 in October. I was worried they might be a little big since she is petite so I inflated them today at home and they are huge!!! I tried one on and they fit me! Needless to say I am an adult, I don't know any 8 year olds my size much less any 4 year olds. I am so disappointed. We left my daughters floaties at a hotel last weekend. They had been the same brand but from last year. Hopefully I can find the same kind again. (the ones that inflate all the way around the arm, vs this flat underside style.)"
2,Durability,Size is larger than indicated on package and the plastic under the arm band area rips easily.
5,Better then the 2nd Manga!!!!,"I saw All ringus and read the manga! In this thrilling prequel to Ring, young Sadako Yamayura becomes an actress, in hopes of escaping the nightmares of her past. She then discovers that her acting career Is not what it seems. She then starts to show all her powers and what she can do. It even shows when she dies!! and where else will you find the best view of Sadako?? Well then buy this book!!!"
5,Works great. No problems.,"The adapter works great. The only problem, like LKR wrote, is that your phone needs to be plugged in to your USB port. This also means that your phone is essentially dead until you dial the number on SKYPE. You cannot dial a phone number using SKYPE using your regular phone (you have to purchase a SKYPE phone for this and be corded to your computer).Once you dial the number from the computer, you can pick up your phone and walk away from it. I live in an apartment, so this isn't a problem for me. But, it I lived in a two- or three-story house and I want to be mobile, I would have to go to the room where the computer is, dial the phone number, and walk back to the room where I want to complete the phone call. This is an inherent problem with SKYPE being a P2P service rather than a VOIP service. IT IS NOT A PRODUCT PROBLEM."
1,Cheap product from China,I was very disappointed. The unit looks like a cheap knock-off and the user guide is not adequate. Not user friendly.
2,Please read!,"This product only works properly if you have a phone line and are using skype. Do not use this product if all you plan to use is skype, it does not react well to this scenario. But, if you are looking for a way to get cheap long distance for your existing phone service this is a great device."
1,"Not original quality, after market quality","These Motorcraft parts look just like after-market parts. The factory originals were polished hardened steel made out of a rust-resistant alloy. The alloy is everything when it comes to rust and wear. These new parts look identical to after market parts, with an inferior alloy that only has a plated finish. Unless your originals are damaged, you are better off cleaning and buffing the originals, than replacing them with these new parts, which will not last very long before the finish wears off, and rust begins."
2,you get what you pay for,"the buttons stick and it makes a loud, annoying beep every hour that I can't turn off."
5,Great bargain,"Item works exactly as described; easy to use, convenient controls (we attached it to the elliptical machine with velcro). Great price, too!"
4,Behemoth,"I ordered this as a Christmas present and was afraid it would not arrive on time. It came promptly, thank you."
4,"More power, but haven't seen the MPGs","I have an 06 Sierra with the 5.3 liter also. Truck is a crew cab. The installation was easy and quick. The thing I noticed right away was the difference in power and response on acceleration. I had heard that the engine runs a bit louder, but that is only when you put your foot in it. I have heard some say that the transmission shifts smoother also, and I found the same to be true with mine.I was expecting a little bit better gas mileage from what others have said. I also replaced my spark plugs with NGK iridiums and MSD spark plug wires. I have noticed an increase in gas mileage, but not the 2 MPGs listed earlier. I have only had this on for about 2-3 weeks, so maybe I need more observation time. I think right now I'm probably getting about 1/2 to 1 additional MPG with the cold air intake, spark plugs, and wires."
3,Good price for what you get,I've two trucks with the 5.3... One 07 Chevy and one 06 GMC... On the 07 Chevy I put an airaid and the 06 gmc I put this K&N; on... My honest opinion is spend the couple bucks extra and go with the airaid. The k&n; mount that bolts where the factory air box went and where the filter goes on is really cheap and flimsy where as the airaid mount is a lot thicker and didn't move around and bend like the k&n; did on me.Overall for the $206 I spent on it I'm happy but next time if the airaid was within $30-40 I would get that one... After running both you can tell the airaid is a stronger better built kit.I also put the red air aid throttle body spacers on both trucks and they fit fine with either intake.
3,Sent the wrong one. Again!,"Looks nice but won't connect to my Mass Air Sensor. My truck model is not listed on any of the factory supplied paperwork. I am dissapointed in my Amazon order.My replacement arrived with next day free shipping, I was excited, but it was exactly the same, wrong, part number and also will not fit my truck. I will be returning it also. A call to the K&N; service number told me that possibly Amazon has the wrong part number in their look up system. Disappointed again:("
1,wrong air filter,what sent the wrong air filter did not fit the car so I returned it I did not want to go through the hassle and trying to get the right 1
5,K&N filter Gen II,Received the K&N Gen II for my 05 Chevy Silverado. The packing was great and looks as if everything is there except I did not receive a packing slip with receipt nor did I receive any installation instructions which is slightly important. Good job guys on the shipping and packing but make sure you include instructions as even though fairly apt to figure it out I would like the instructions to confirm installation is correct
1,over hyped,don't plan on saving a dime in fuel savings. I do like the howling noise it makes when I first get on the expressways.
3,Don't buy anything from GOHASTINGS!!!,"I really cannot comment on this item, because I never received it or a response to four(4) e-mails and a letter to the president of gohastings. Worst seller I have ever dealt with on Amazon. gohastings has horible customer service. I will never buy from gohastings again even if I have to pay double!!! Bad merchant, stay away from gohastings."
5,Very Very Cool,"SPOILERS******This is a really intelligent treatment of the vampire myth -- very philosophical (well, in the background -- NOT BORING!)I find the most fascinating question it asks is: if the Code Vs (code fives) only ""convert"" people who are willing (and don't kill when they feed), what does that do to the whole ethical dilemma of wiping them out?(OK, the less fascinating question that isn't addressed is: Fine, they don't reflect in mirrors or on video or photographs --but why don't their clothes? But forget that for the purposes of making it a really neat crime show.)This is very well written; well acted; exciting and a thought-provoking premise -- and it doesn't surprise me at all that Fox-TV couldn't replicate it (I speak as a Firefly fan.)"
5,A different kind of Vampire series......,"I bought this DVD set about four years ago. And from the very first five minutes I was hooked.This show keeps you in suspense, never mentions the word Vampires, but we all know they are. The actors are terrific in their rolls.Some folks think that it's drawn out, and slow. But I say that's what makes it different. It unravels slowlySo if you are looking for a great British Horror TV series, this might be the one for you."
5,An excellent treatment of a difficult topic,"Not only has the treatment of vampirism been elevated to a kind of scientific plausibility, it has been done so in a style that is absolutely captivating. I have watched this three times through (all five hours of it) and I will certainly watch it several times again. There is so much complexity that every time I see it, I find whole new threads and subplots to interest me.The writing is brilliant and the acting is so convincing that you find yourself taken into a world that you otherwise would not have accepted for a second. Moreover, the depth of emotions evoked by this story will often catch you off-guard, and in several cases, put a lump in your throat. If the understated scene with Susannah Harker vainly trying to pump life back into the rape victim doesn't deeply move you, nothing ever will.This is story-telling at its very best!"
5,Moody and Classy,"For fellow Yanks who haven't been enamored of British imports because they're strange or cheaply produced--try this one. Pound sterling was spent on this production, and it shows. The plot employs a clinical, realistic approach to vampires (so, goth-fans might be disappointed) in which a London police inspector finds himself drawn into a mysterious agency with a mysterious mandate. The show is moody in tone, with strong characterizations, crisp and pleasing visuals, and a sublimely beautiful soundtrack. This was a real surprise for me, and I have a Britisher named James (who mostly enjoys American dramas) to thank for directing me to it."
4,Handsome Man and Vampires,I bought this because I adore Jack Davenport. The series is interestingly done and creative and the cast is very good. The story follows a mysterious squad of modern vampire hunters in London. We learn all of their reasons for joining the squad and it is fun to see who will win in this good vs evil battle.
3,Not sure what the hype is about,After reading all the great reviews I purchased this for my wife who happens to enjoy good vampire flicks. So far we have only watched the first two episodes and we are finding it hard to make the time to watch the rest. We find it boring and not that creative.
1,sloppy production of dvd,"Full frame; no captions; marginal sound track recording with hard to understand accents increases the difficulty of following the story. Some intersting ideas but weak plot detracts from overall interest. No star quality in actors, but they are competent. Now that I have seen Fringe on Blu-Ray the overall quality seems unacceptable. I had to check on the internet to make sure I was understanding both the plot and the rules of this imaginary world. Midnight, canceled in the first season, is more interesting and looks better while Buffy seems like the gold standard by comparison."
5,Vampires put to practicality,"Well woven story of the practical way to which the vampire would be,in modern times, led to beheld and a typical government answer. The story and actors do a good job wrestling with the biggest question of all: what of the future of us all?"
2,"Pedantic, Pedestrian and Predictable","From the beginning, so much of this book reads like a bad movie-of-the-week. You can even guess where they will insert the commercial messages.Characters are more two dimentional than a Charlie Brown comic strip. There's a Chicago Police Captain named James T. O'Malley,whose middle name is Theodosius who sounds like Pat O'Brien in a 1930's movie. BTW does the name James Tiberius Kirk ring a bell.Maybe it's all just to subtle for me? Duh, no."
5,Great Book,"I love Grisham books and this reminded me of him...great characters, interesting story line and easy to read. I didn't want to put it down because I was dying to see what happened next."
5,"Evil, Come Back!!!","I have now read this book twice. What a great opening! The story pulls you in. I am already imagining who I would put into the movie...Steven Segal... perhaps, Harrison Ford...Andie MacDowell as the wife. I enjoyed the relationships between 'Lilly' and his old partners, kind of like the 'Fantastic 4' without the costumes, you really want to get to know these guys. You will enjoy the pacing of this story, it is enjoyably suspenseful, it is the perfect 'kick back and relax' bedtime thriller. Chicagoans will really get a kick out of this story. I would like the author to write a Prequel and a Sequel. In the end you will want more, and you will be sorry that 'Evil, Be Gone.' Please, Evil Come Back! Thanks for the read."
5,Great Purchase,"I purchased this chair for my art studio. The price was very reasonable, easy to assemble and arrived quickly in excellent condition. It's very comfortable and a real plus without the arms to get in the way. It's light weight and rolls easily around the studio. I would highly recommend this for any office, computer room or studio."
3,"Not as good as ""Who Wrote the Bible""","I had enjoyed Friedman's ""Who Wrote the Bible"" very much. In fact, I have read it several times and gone over it with several ministers, who believe it, but won't preach it.I was hoping for similar insights in this book. There are some, but most of the book is a translation of the Old Testament, Genesis to the first two chapters of Kings. His translation is what he considers the hidden book. I'm afraid I got bored, and never finished it."
1,This book should not be taken a serious scholarship.,"The author proposes the old yarn of the 19th century German higher critics -- that there was a book of J, which was the sourse material for the Bible. (This is the J, E, P, and D interpretation of Bible authorship).While there is a fringe group of people who ascribe to this view, it is widely discarded as being nonsense. There is so much evidence to the contary, I don't know why anyone takes these argument seriously. This is not a work of serious scholarship by any means. If you are looking for scholarship on this subject, then you need to look elsewhere.But if you want to take a look at an entertaining glimpse of this point of view, you may wish to check this book out of the library. Or if you wish to further dilute yourself with this type of erroneous scholarship to further validate your own opinion and world view, then you may like this work."
5,Great Product,I have a dog with sensitive skin. My vet recommended this shampoo because it is soapless. It foams just like a soap shampoo and leaves my two dogs shiny and smelling great.
1,The sputter gun,I purchased this product today for a small home project with plans of future use on other projects. This is my third electric spray gun in the past 35 years and was very disappointed with its performance. It was difficult to obtain a steady spray as it kept sputtering and making a mess. Other guns I have used bring a viscosity cup in order to get the proper mixture. This one lacked this simple attchment. The clean up was more than I bargained for an ended up returning the the purchase.
1,Don't go there. Ask any past user,"I purchased the Wagner Power Painter one speed 1600 psi to paint the inside of my garage, ceiling and all.I attached the attachments and followed all the procedures only to get a minor sputtering of paint out of the jar and then none out of the tubing that led to the bucket.Its weak motor made a lot of noise and was hard to hold but couldn't spray standard interior paint to save its soul. I'm returning it expecially after telling my tale to others only to find similar stories.The reputation of this machine amongst home improvers and construction folk alike was that it isn't worth the trouble of carrying it home. I had to hand roll out the whole garage myself. Since my husband is due back from the middle east soon I wanted to make everything nice for him and that flop set my tight schedule back a whole day."
5,Truly a gem!!!!,"Halo Repair is a delightful, insightful and inspirational reminder of how we touch others in our everyday lives. A quick read which I have enjoyed reading over and over again. Packed with kernels of wisdom from many faiths and cultures, it has helped me to fine tune my philosophy of life. Makes a great gift for family and friends."
1,JUNK,This sprinkler does not even come close to covering 4000 sq ft. Barely covers 400 sq ft. And yes my water pressure is fine I have other sprinklers that do what they say. I will be returning this.
4,Great Sprinkler!,"It is very hard to find a decent sprinkler these days. I didn't want some crap made in China.. I wanted a strong,long lasting product made in the U.S.A. And I got it!! This sprinkler is very strong and made to last. It is adjustable for lawns of all shapes and sizes. I use it on my front lawn & my backyard. Both very different in size and shape. You won't go wrong."
4,Oh How Romantic!,"Captain Corelli's mandolin is very sweet, and exciting because it's set in the middle of a war. But at the same time the way Cage and Cruz fall in love ironic, and heartbreakingly sad. Meet Joe Black is funny,intriguing, and so very romantic. It has a great plot, with a palpable chemistry between Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani, there love is so amazing it makes you want to cry."
2,The quality of this DVD was not good,"the DVD works only on one of my DVD players even both are good. In addition, the Captain Corelli's Mandolin in onlty partial viewable."
4,Guide to Modern American Cooking,"This cookbook has various wonderful and delicious courses which showed in easy-to-follow steps. Attractive photos and simple ingredients also let me to cook confidently and enjoy the wholly success result. I feel very delightful to find a recipe ""Lamb chops Liza(p.158)"" which is as same to my name. Also, this recipe's skilful adjusted herb proportion, which bring out special taste of lamb chops. I often cook this admirable recipe for I can enjoy the simple and delicious taste of lamb. Futhermore, the cookbook also enrich my daily life for I just to glance anyone recipe then I can cook easily according to the book and find no difficult to buy any ingredients. Hope you will like the cookbook as me,too. Have a good day!"
4,"A little dated, but still full of great information!","I bought this book for research purposes. Even though some would consider it a little outdated, a lot of the facts inside are still usable to this day. From collecting rain water and safely drinking pond and river water, to treating snake-bites, field-dressing wounds, and living off the land, it is full of wisdom any camper, survivalist, or boy/girl scout could use."
2,Thin Blanket,"I was expecting a thicker blanket, but it is quite thin and even folded does not provide much support."
4,Enjoyable and enlightening,"Very happy I read this book. Great inside info on the U2, SR71 and F177A stealth planes and how they were developed, funded and used. After listening to Ben Rich's comments I wish we had more organizations use these small independent research divisions in their arsenal. Let's hope they continue to provide the technological edge we may need in the future. A good read and well worth the money."
4,A compelling read for anyone vaguely interested in aviaition,"You've seen the Skunk Works' aircraft on the Discovery Channel. Now you have the whole story - or at least as much as one of the foremost authorities on the subject is willing and able to tell you. ""Skunk Works"" is a great read, written by a man with intimate knowledge of one of the most fascinating periods in American aviation and its role in the diplomatic intrigue of the Cold War era. Just as compelling as the subject matter is Ben R. Rich and Leo Janos' ability to communicate unimaginable engineering problems in a manner that makes you feel like you really understand what they are talking about. Not likely for most of us, but it's great fun along the way."
4,The man speaks the truth,"As a guy who has talked to the people that Rich worked with, from U-2 pilots to Air Force officers who have budgetary control over black projects, this book truly is for real. He takes a highly technical topic and breaks it down so any layman can truly appreciate the skill of the men who ran the Skunkworks.Go ahead, folks. Dig in and learn why American ingenuity and know-how will dominate the world. Aerospace engineers can finally step out from behind the curtain and take their bow."
3,Book review,The book was in a good condition and I enjoyed to read the content of the book! Knowledgeable and with figures make it easy to understand..
2,Of its time,"This book is very much of its time, and has to be regarded as such. I was forced to read this for work by an over zealous client. I gritted my teeth to the end. Yes, on one level it is fascinating as a piece of history. Even I quite enjoyed the history of the U2 and Blackbird, which I vaguely remember from newspapers in my youth. But as a chronicle of social mores, it made my toes curl. Unfortunately, as a female of mid years clinging to the corporate ladder, I still remember when the kind of casual misogeny portrayed here was the norm not the exception. Can't say I miss 'the good 'ol days' one bit. The interchangeable wives and sophomoric giggling over the pin ups?It isn't even very well written.I have to read 'Patton on Leadership' next. Time to look for a new job maybe?"
2,Ben Rich seems very impressed with Ben Rich,"I found the interesting events at the ""Skunk Works"" were overshadowed by how impressed the author was that ""he"" beat all the odds. The book seems to be Ben Rich's carefully drawn out case as to why he ran the Works better than Kelly Johnson. I am sure both were great men but I am more interested in the aggregate of talent and how different people truly contributed."
5,GREAT,My first book in twenty years. Finished within a month. I'm not much of reader but this book caught my full attention and interest.
5,"Aerospace, Management, Problem solving - all in one...","After hearing and reading about this book so much, I had to check it out in person.Ben Rich was the head of Lockheed's Skunk Works for over 15 years in the 70's and 80's. This is the story of the work he has done there on some of the most advanced, original and... cool flying (and sometimes floating) machines ever.""Skunk Works"" is a great book for anyone interested in the Aerospace industry or in methods of management. While exposing the cold war's best kept secrets, Rich outlines his philosophy of managing people and projects, and problem solving.The stories of the birth of the U-2 F-117a, the SR-71 and the Stealth boat are told alongside the development of the ""Skunk Works"" - all are a work of art."
5,Scintillating,"One of my english teachers once told me: Good books make you never want to put them down, great books are the ones in which you are so caught up in the story you never realize that you're reading. Rich's account lends the reader a unique perspective into the lives of many who worked heroicly behind the curtain of secrecy. A fabulous read!"
5,Skunk Works,"I have just found one of the best books that I have seen in a long time Skunk Works.It was written by Ben Rich, the recent head of the Skunk Works facility - as in the U2, Blackbird, Stealth Planes.It starts out about how the concept of a stealth plane got started (during the cold war), and how they were able to build it.The theory of the technology came from a paper by Pyotr Ufimtsev, chief scientist at the Moscow Institute of Radio Engineering. During the 1960s, he wrote about a concept that a Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell came up with back in 1831. With today's small powerful computers, Stealth plane design was now possible.A great book, and I found it very funny. I was surprised to discover that the Skunk Works is an independent group of Lockheed, not controlled by either the CIA the government or Lockheed - of course that is where the money comes from, but that group comes up with their own money making projects that their very well paid engineers build."
1,waste of money,Information given in the books are conflicting. Does not have enough information and you will still end up buying more books to have complete information.
1,Horrible Book,"This is one of the worst guide books I have encountered. I brought this book for my niece who is applying to these programs. It is poorly written, the advice is not insightful, and this book is a rip off of an earlier guide book From High School to Med. School."" My niece bought that book instead and it was much better. Get that, it's much better!"
1,Not the original,"There is another book out there called ""From High School to Med. School: The Definitive Guide to Accelerated Medical Programs"" by Yanofski and Raju. It was published well before this book, and this is a copy of that book. Why buy a copy, when you can have the original? From High School to Med. School is a much better book, more informative, and the standard."
1,Mediocre at best,"This book lacks solid advice and attempts to make up for it with ""accesory"" items. Vocabulary words and postcards just don't make a book. If you want vocabulary words, you can buy several other books that are much better. The book attempts to sell itself to you with it's bells and supposed whistles. In addition, there aren't that many 6 year programs left in the country. I have the first book (by Raju and Yanofski) written on accelerated medical programs and even though it is 2 years old, its information is what is valuable. It's a far better book and probably what this book is based on (or, dare I say it - copied)!"
1,Save your money,"I bought this book after seeing it named on a few web sites and reading other reviews. What a waste.The information contained in the book is easily obtained on a few web sites. The American Association of Medical Schools has a listing as complete if not more so than in this book....P>The authors provide their own rankings of schools in the book. They are very clear that they are biased and limited to their knowledge and some interviews. ...Information on types of colleges, universities, etc contained in this book was a fraction of the vaste amount available in any library or college resource room at most high schools.The book has a great premise and lousy execution."
3,its ok,"on behalf that it is not a orginal cd but a burned one,the sound is loud you cant hear the words good.so its ok but i wont by these cds again."
1,OMG?,There's four Lindsay Lohans! One is bad enough. Why must we have four Lindsay Lohans in the music industry. Lindsay sucks!
3,Good but limited,"This is a good book... but the reviews are too few. If they list the model and make of which you're inquiring, GREAT(!). But there exists 100's of models by 100's of builders. A good reference book for the boats they list. The boats listed are generally between the 20 to 35 ft models with a few up to 45 ft."
4,Happy,Very happy with the product. Perfect for someone with a commute. Ne need to sit down at computer or with book which i don't have time to do.
1,Lousy,"Do not purchase this item, I was throughly disappointed and feel misled by all the positive reviews. They can't possibly be real. It is impossible to learn a language via this method. It is strictly by rote, they do not spell the words or show them on a screen which would be so helpful. You simply sit and repeat back what the instructer is saying, it is not only ineffective but very, very boring. A total waste of money."
5,Good supplement for language learning,"I own Pimsleur's French I and II language courses. I just love them! I plan on purchasing French III. I took private lessons in French for 6 years. I can read the more basic French and am familiar with French grammar but wasn't very fluent. I hate to memorize. That's what my instructor said I must do in order to become more fluent. I love the Pimsleur series because it forces to do that. I plan on using what I learned with the Pimsleur method as a foundation for further learning through other methods including more reading in French, review of vocabulary and grammar, and finding more opportunities to hear French spoken and speaking in French."
5,Amazing.,"Was difficult at first and then became easier almost immediately. I thought I couldn't possibly know enough to get by when I went to France on tour with Solillaquists of Sound, but ended up this amazing learning tool got into my head more than i was expecting! I understood most of what people were saying and could piece things together that were new. I also could speak clearly and with an amazing accent. Super program, great tour."
1,Learn in Your Car French and Behind the Wheel French Are Much Better,"I returned my Pimsleur course because I was so disappointed in the rigidity of the 'gradual interval recall' method that requires that you 'stay glued' to the CD player for a half an hour in order to derive any benefit from the course.I much prefer the lively and spontaneous method used in Behind the Wheel French. There is also more vocabulary in Learn in Your Car French and Behind the Wheel French than in the Pimsleur course.I am not knocking Pimsleur but I did notice a lack of 'practical basics' like emphasis on the days of the week, months of the year and so forth. I do need some structure and I did not find it here.Also, Pimsleur is far too expensive for what you get. And no multiple tracks,And no written material for this high price.My advice is to shop elsewhere for your French course my friend."
4,ALMOST Perfect,"The first level of this three level kit spends a lot of time teaching you the bare basics of the French language. By the 8th it really became irritating when the speaker would ask me to say ""Do you understand English?"". However as you progress you realize that this constant reptition is extremely helpful.In the later lessons there is a stronger focus on composing your own sentances. The grammar becomes more complex and they even introduce you to tenses. Overall I think this makes the kit a great introduction to the French language. I give it four stars instead of five because I feel that it doesn't help enough with the pronunciation. Being a beginner in French can be very scary espeacially since French has some difficult to pronounce consonants, in particular the gluttoral /r/. In addition it doesn't offer much for vocabulary, but as long as you use this kit in conjunction with another book (Easy French Reader makes up for Pimsleur's speaking-approach) you should be fine."
2,Disapointed in Warm Things Robe,"I am very disappointed in the down fill in the Warm Things Down Robe. It has very little down fill so naturally is not a warm robe. Definitely is not what I was expecting from the description. The robe seems to be well made, it just has minimal down fill. Don't buy this robe and expect to get a robe to keep you warm, just a nice robe to wear.I recently purchased a down robe from another online source (Lands End). The Lands End robe is a bit shorter than the Warm Things but far exceeds it in warmth. If you want warmth check out Lands End."
5,The BEST robe I've ever owned!,"Our house is drafty and chilly and every winter I tote around my down blanket. But not anymore! Received this robe for Christmas and I haven't left the house since. It covers to the floor keeping my feet warm (I'm 5'4"")and the sleeves can be folded back if too long and it is still comfortable and looks nice.A fantastic, quality product, highly recommended!"
3,Color is Inaccurate,"It's warm and it fits but I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed in the color. They're calling it teal, but it's more like a wedgewood color... or that blue tone that reminds me of plasticware from the 1980s. Bleh."
4,Very nice warm robe!,This was a Christmas gift. Very good looking and stylish robe. We were concerned about buying this on line because we had a bad experience with buying a robe on line about two years ago. No problem with this robe because it turned out to be even better than advertized.
5,Down Robe,"I love this robe--it is very warm and I am glad I bought it. It has, however, one inner, extra tie under the right, inner pocket in addition to the ususal inner waist ties. Don't know why it is there--I still rate the robe high because it does the job of being very warm. I haven't seen any shedding & have not washed it yet."
2,Disappointing from 21st Century Toys,"We have purchased numerous 21st Century Toys in the past and have always been pleased, however, that was not the case with this purchase. When the toy arrived, its leg was snapped at the knee and the Velcro from one of the vest accessories came off on the first pull. While it won't keep us from considering 21st Century Toys in the future, it was disappointing that the manufacture on this particular item was so poor."
3,this is a joke in the name of bord review,"The questions are ridiculously simple, and does not reflect the boards in terms of presentation, complexity and content. Even as a study guide it's focus is not evenly distributed, because that's what you need when you are prepaing for Part I.I gave it 3 stars only because it has it's own niche. There are not many question books to use before taking the Part I."
1,"Questions are generally either too easy, or overly detailed, unfortunately not that helpful","Some of the neurology questions have errors (I used Kaufman's Clinical neurology for Psychiatrists as a Cross reference). The psychiatric questions are generally too easy, or have overly detailed and irrelevant facts, for example question 381. True/False ""According to DSM IV, a traumatic event may involve witnessing a traumatic occurence"", answer True, obviously.Question 366 True False: ""Use of valproic acid is associated with less than a two to three percent risk of NTD following 1st trimester exposure"". Answer: False its about 5%""Bottom line: Probably not worth your time or money. Low yield. I was quite dissapointed in this review material."
1,Biased,"Two of the four questions on ME (CFS) show a bias that toward thinking it is a psychiatric illness. Things like ""search for serious and treatable illnesses"" and ""tell the patient about the role of inactivity in causing fatigue"" among others. Advocating more activity to an ME patient often results in increased morbidity because of post exertional malaise.There are oven 4,000 articles in peer reviewed medical journals showing significant biological pathology in ME."
5,great basic book,"This is a great basic book 70 page book on this subject. I have about 10 different books on camp cooking, and this one covers many areas of outdoor cooking including camp stoves, fire making, selecting the right pots and pans. How to pack lightly is covered as well as sources to find things. Then there are the recipes which all work great and tste delicious. The writer has a homey style that is very comfortable to read, kind of like an old friend or uncle explaining things to you. The book is affordable. The interior illustrations are nice too."
3,Not what I needed,"I purchased this guage in hopes of adapting it to replace the cheap fuel guage in my Bolie inverter.The Moeller guage is made very well, looks nice and I wish it could have worked out but it was not adaptable to my situation. I didn't return it because I thought I might use some other tme.BKH"
4,A Good Mystery,"This was a good ""Flower Shop Mystery"". The mystery/plot was good. However, this book didn't quite grab me the way I like a book to; that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. To me, the setting wasn't quite cozy enough. The flower shop/coffee shop was interesting, but not talked about in such a way to make it seem really cozy. And I would have liked more floral descriptions. Abby and the shop employees were interesting and likable. But I didn't care for some of the other characters in the book; namely Jillian."
1,The most appealing part was the Cover,"Having recently started reading cozy mysteries, such as Diane Mott Davidson and Cleo Coyle, I thought the Flowershop series sounded interesting but was sadly mistaken. I ordered this book on-line and have never been able to finish it. It is just not cozy enough. The appeal of such authors as Davidson is her characters grab you right away and your drawn into the small town life wonderful recipes and overall ""feel"" of the book.This is not the case with the flowershop mysteries. In fact the titles and the pastel covers are the best things about these books."
2,could have been better,"Sounded like a cute idea, but author tried to be too cute. Main character Abby is ANNOYING. She butts into many people's lives and they just tell her secrets for no reason. She's pushy and demanding, but cannot say no to her even more annoying and selfish cousin, nor can she ask her aunt to pay for the wedding flowers. Plus she has several oh-so handsome men just hanging around her. Isn't she lucky for someone so hard to take? Some interesting characters other than the ""heroine"" and storyline was ok, but I can't stand Abby so won't be reading any more of these."
1,Grit in Every Mouthful,"Without exaggeration, practically every mouthful of quinoa from this brand contained some grit.After using the entire bag of this brand, I bought cases of two other brands for comparison. I encountered no grit in a whole bag of one of those other brands, and only one little bit in one mouthful out of the other entire bag.I won't be buying this brand again."
1,HORRIBLE ...,This is a hokey muzak kind of cd with just awful sax playing by alleged musicians who did well to remain anonymous.
5,This work great!,I got 1 for side to side angle on my tractor and 2 for both directions on my mini-excavator. They do exactly what I want them to do... show me the tipping angles are not nearly as bad as they seem to be. Highly recommended.
3,Needs to be more durable,"I like the softness of the luxe cover but I think I would not choose this type of cover again because it is so thin and lets spit up or moisture right through to the boppy. Also, the pattern on my boppy shows through and I have had to resew the seams on my slipcover multiple times in multiple places because they pulled apart in the 5 months that I have been using it. I love my boppy but the slipcover leaves much to be desired for the price you pay - I will probably make a better and sturdier one myself."
1,spend the money,"sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the superior product. buy from pottery barn and order additional covers from them as well. same pillow but the fleece-like cover exclusively at pottery barn is actual ""luxury."" more comfortable for mom and baby. wears amazingly well due to thickness and stains lift right out. we have used one cover continuously for over 4 months and it's still like new. in another class from the ""chintzie"" alternatives offered at other stores."
2,For White Boppy Only,"This cover is so thin that you can see the pattern on most Boppys right through it. It only works well on light colored or white solid Boppys. It is soft, but it didn't feel very durable to me. I sent it back."
4,Great product,"I have twins, so I use my Boppys a lot. I have this slipcover in blue and pink. The fabric is really soft the texture prevents my babies from slipping off or out of the Boppy. The cover is easy to remove and put on and washes up great. The only real improvement I would like to see is to have a waterproof lining or something to protect the Boppy even more since it is a little difficult to wash. Overall, very satisfied!!!"
1,Shredded & Ripped after 1 Wash!,These slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing! I bought two of these; one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside. I constantly have to cut the strings:-(
4,Good book,"Its a good book and all the notes are accurate. My only compliant is the the tabs are a little bit hard to read. The way the lettering is done makes it difficult to see the letters while ur trying to play along with the song.Besides that its awesome, and a must have for Floyd loving musicians.-King"
3,Meh...,I didn't care for their tone or feel as much as either DR Pure Blues or Thomasik Jazz Swing flats.
1,Three words,"Don't even bother. I tried one of these to paint the latice on my deck which is a pain to paint by hand. I tried everything, adjusting the flow, thinning the paint, adjusting the head etc. I could get this thing to spray in a mist pattern for a few seconds and then it would start shooting a uneven mist with a jet in the middle, like a weak water pistol. I played with this thing for hours and all I wound up doing is wasting about a half gallon of paint.Crap."
1,I hated this unit.,"This is junk. I painted three rooms and put up with an occasional sputter. I'd just get the roller out and fix the splatter. I tried thinned latex... and really thinned. When I started the ceilings, I got one done. By the second one the unit seemed to give up and die. I threw it in the backyard. Aside from this, the trigger left my finger numb. I now wish I had bought the Fuji HVLP system."
4,Excellent time saver,Once I figured out how to set up the Wagner 220 it worked great. Its a big time saver you can paint a 12X12 room including ceiling in less than 1 hour. Good for larger jobs since clean up takes about 15 minutes. I would have given 5 stars if I did not have to thin the laytex paint before starting.
2,Not for small or easy jobs.,"Reviewer James R Orr is right on the money. I own the ""Wide Shot Plus 2400 PSI 2-Speed"" but my experience painting a 10' x 14' shed is identical to James' excellent description. I sympathize too with Gene Taylor's sentiments. If you have a small or easy (flat surface) job, this tool isn't worth it. Using it is a commitment in time, patience, and cleanup. If you have a large or difficult job though, I recommend it - you'll still cuss and hate it and make a big mess."
2,Horrible game,"I am sooooooo disappointed with this game. I have been looking forward to this game coming out and was excited when it finally did. First of all I had to hunt for it b/c it was not released on time. Well my wife found it for me and surprised me with it. Well I was the eager beaver and went home and popped it in the xbox and started to play... well that was the end of the fun. Fun's over. Let's put it this way...the game costs $20 and I think they spent that on the budget as well to make the game. Extremely low budget no fun title. It has so much potential and was wasted. The boats look like crud, the boats handle like crud, the fishing is clunky, and the fish look so fake and no fun to catch. The only good thing about this game is that the water looks good, hence the 2-star rating. Avoid this game at all costs. Save your money and find a copy of Pro Fishing Challenge on the Xbox which is the best and most awesome fishing title I have found yet and is a ton of fun to play."
2,game,keeps freezing up! It was used therefore it only cost me 5 bucks.... would probably cost more to send it back!!!
4,Bass Pro Fishing game,"I bought this for my 10 year old son. He enjoys the game immensely, and we have played it together a few times. I think it is money well spent."
1,Poor ordering/availability practices,"Item ordered and credit card charged. Received e-mail notification that item had shipped. Several days later, received e-mail from company stating that item was unavailable and that shipping notification was an automatically generated message. Took over three weeks for credit to be issued back. Company should not generate shipping notification messages unless items are actually being shipped."
4,Randolph's Magnetic Theory,"Randolph's philosophical discourse is an interesting read as he attempts to explain why the world is so messed up. Couples who are not magnetically aligned are producing ""angular"" children, incomplete souls, which in turn are filling the world, especially, as Randolph sees it, America with magnetically mis-aligned misfits. Randolph's language is clearly formed by his oratory background, and his ideas a fusion of Swedenborg, Sufi-ism and Emersonian idealism. As a black writer, he has been under-appreciated, and perhaps shunned because of his extensive discussion of sex and his prescriptive use of hashish. A very interesting read."
4,Great buy for the money,"This is a very nice jacket and washable too!Only complaint is that the elastic around the cuffs was really tight, so I removed it, which wasn't the easiest thing to do."
1,Could have liked it IF it had only arrived,"Never got it, got a lot of follow-on email, then a cancellation. Not good business."
3,Brandon Thomas Men's Suede Jacket,"It's a nice-looking jacket, and I would have given it 5 stars, but the zipper broke after using it a few times."
4,Some of the Best Relaxation Music I've Heard!,"This has to be the best music for putting a baby to sleep, it's slow, undulating tones is one of the best I've heard for relaxation."
2,"Gives basics easy to read, Captain Visual is better",I was disappointed. The writing style is fun but the amount of material is small compared to Captain Visuals book (at about the same price).
3,Great Beginner's book,I did not find this book to meet my own needs but I was able to give the book to a person interested in balloon twisting and get them hooked. The illustrations are easy to follow and help to enhance the instructions. The other parts of the book add to it well. We don't need balloon books that just teach us how to make specific animals. We need balloon books that will teach us other things too.
2,No big deal,"It's not really that great. It's interesting only if you are a beginner. It's nothing compared to ""Ballonicature"", the CD-ROm from the same author."
4,Walking on Water,"Jensen's ""W.O.W"" is part memoir, part polemic on America's industrialized system of education which he has been a part of as a writing teacher in higher ed and the prison system. His arguments for the power of writing as a humanizing force are compelling and inspiring for teachers of writing at any level, and his anecdotes describing his unconventional approach to classroom teaching are thought-provoking for any teacher looking for a fresh perspective on reaching students. And it's a quick and entertaining read!"
4,A new meaning to learning,"This book actually opened my eyes to the meaning of learning. My brother and I relate to Derrick Jensen because we both do not like to learn what they teach us. We both had a conversation about this subject a while back. We knew that we liked to learn about things that interest us. For example, slavery, holocaust, aliens, or supernatural. Why did these things exist and why did people follow what others told them to do. In this book the author gives examples of so many questions. In other books you follow the story and one already knows what is going to happen in the next chapter. In this book one thinks and asks themselves the same exact question. What the book was trying to tell me is that no one in this world knows who they truly are or know how to act on their own. We all learned to do what others tell us to do. If you want to know how these teachers students learned to find out who they truly are read the book and you will have thoughts in your head day and night."
3,Walking on Water,"I gave this book 3 stars because it was very interesting. Most of the book was fun to read but there were parts where I had to drag myself to read it. Which I found kind of ironic because one of the main points in this book was to keep your readers from being bored when they read it. The point of this book was to explain the faults in todays current schooling system. Derrick Jensen did a good job explaining how corrupt our schooling system actually is. He also is a very forward author so if you are uncomfortable with foul language or permiscuious writing, dont read the book. Overall, I did enjoy the book and I would reccomend it to someone who felt like reading a very strong opinionated book about our schools. I would also reccomend this book for a teacher to read, so they can get some useful advice about their teaching skills."
5,"""The House of The Scorpion"" Reveiw","I think that this book is a wonderful Science Fiction book, and I hate reading Science Fiction Books. The way Nancy Farmer expressed Matt's Feeling to the reader makes you really feel for him, in all his misfortune. Will love the suspence and exciting twists and turns. It will keep you guessing. Even if you hate Science Fiction,like me, you will still love ""The House of the Scorpion. This is probably my favorit book I have read so far this year. Even though there isn't much Science Fiction, it is still an amazing story."
4,The House of the Scorpion,"The House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer was a very good book in my opinion. The main character, Matteo Alcran, is both a real person and a clone. He does not know it yet, but El Patron only made him just so he could use his heart. Maria, who Matt has a crush on, hates and is afraid of him because he is a clone. The only friend of Matt's goes away and suddenly life turns on him.This book starts off slow but after about 100 pages it is very exciting. I recommend this book to anybody who likes an adventure story."
4,Daughter enjoys it,This was a great read for my daughter this summer. She loved every chapter and the journey the kids go through in every chapter. Would defintely recommend.
4,The Wicked Secret of the Alacranes,This story takes place between the United States and what was once called Mexico. This story ia also from the future. This is important because thete are no clones in the present.This book is mostly about a boy named Matt who is a clone and does not get along with just anybody. He is marked by his differences and has to learn how to live without having everybody look at him like he's some kind of animal.In my opinion it needs a bit more exciting thrills. It could also do with a bit more storylin would be good.I would rec ommend this book because it is a great fictional piece and has won many awards.
3,No Brave New World,"I must admit, I liked ""House of the Scorpion"" - I thought it brought up important bioethical issues for discussion and came down hard on Communism. The book would be a fine catalyst for such discussions among teenagers. However, I am not sure I'd suggest this to teens to read when Huxley's ""Brave New World"" is so much deeper and better written (not to mention a ""classic""). Overall, ""Scorpion"" is a fine read (although it has a very weak and disappointing ending) but I'd take ""Brave New World"" over it any day."
5,Fantasic!,Great plot! Well-developed characters. Beautifully written. I read it in 2 days - couldn't put it down. What an incredible imagination...
3,House of the Scorpin,"In the book The House of the Scorpions, a regular kid named Matt actually isn't so normal. He asks his personal bodyguard, ""How old am I?"" He just replies, ""I don't know, but you don't have a birthday like regular kids."" To himself he thinks he is a boy but everyone else he knows thinks that he is a beast. The guy who owns the house that Matt lives in has a clone which is Matt. There is absolutely no way out of the house Matt has always wanted to escape the house, but there is no way past the cameras and all of the security guards. At the end of the book Matt is almost used for extra parts but he escapes somehow. This book wasn't the best book I have ever read but overall it is pretty good. If you get confused easily do not read this book it is so confusing. That is why I didn't like it that much."
3,"Plot holes, and rather strong political overtones","I got this book because my book club selected it. I know it won a bunch of awards, but I'm not sure exactly why. I understand that it is a junior reading level, but I found it lacking even still. My husband, who is a huge sci-fi fan also read it and was pretty unimpressed. There are several glaring plot holes in the book. And the political messages were very overt; after a while it was annoying how intense the author's views were on certain topics. All in all, an ok story to read in an afternoon, but one that I'm turning right back around and selling, and would not read a second time."
5,The House Of The Scorpion,"This was an exceptional story. One which draws you in and doesn't let go. It may be put in the childrens section in a bookstore but this novel deals with issues a little over the head of younger readers; diving into the world of drugs, ethics (cloning, mind controll, organ 'donation'), and corruption. The author does a superb job of developing the characters to the point in which if you saw them on the street you would know them by name. The tone of the book feels real and sci-fi at the same time. Overall, you can't find fault with this book. It was excellent and I would reccomend it to anyone older than 12yrs of age."
5,Awesome Book,"This is a stellar book from beggining to end! Though I have not finished the book, I have yet to put it down. If you like sci-fi's this is a very good book for you. A story about clones, corrupt Mexico, and compelling twists that will blow you away."
5,The House of the Scorpion,"Multiple award winning book by Nancy Farmer, The House of the Scorpion, is a must read. Farmer draws the reader into the unforgettable story of Matteo Alacran, a young boy who slowly comes to the realization that he is a clone created for a sinister purpose, and must engage in a monumental struggle to survive. Set in an imaginary future country located just south of the U.S. border, moral and ethical issues surrounding future scientific possibilities engage the mind. Matt's character is immediately endearing and the plot is utterly compelling.-- Reviewed by Kristina Miranda"
4,Good Read!,"I purchased this book because my daughter had to read it for her English class. Since I always read the book she has to before she does (to make sure she's actually reading it)I wasn't too excited about it, especially because it is a futuristic story. It actually turned out to be a pretty good tale with just enough twists and turns to keep your attention. Even my daughter enjoyed it and that's in and of itself is a fantastic thing to say about a book!! Enjoy!"
5,Sci-Fi at it's finest.,"This is a gem amongst Science Fiction novels. I read this book after a few of my friends recommended it to me, and i must say that it was everything they said it was, and more. You really get attached to the characters, and you experience their ups and down with them. Plain and simple, this is a good read and I would highly recommend it to any and all. The plot, characters and dialogue are all well thought out and highly devoloped and it will keep you glued to the pages for hours on end."
4,Visions of the future?,"This novel explores the possibility of a future country between Mexico and the US, a country which is one huge drug farm, worked by slave clones. I discovered this book because I am on a committee for the Mock Newbery Awards 2003. I'm not sure if this would be a Newbery winner, but it was a fascinating read, with plenty of action and suspense. Current issues like the drug trade and human cloning are presented in a intriguing way. The protagonist is a clone of the leading drug lord, special in that he was left ""untouched"", that is, not lobotomized as most clones are. The reason for clones is not only to provide slaves, but for another horrifying reason which the reader can discover. I'd be interested in the thoughts of teenage readers."
5,Nancy Famer is a great writer!!!!,The House of the Scorpion is an adventurous book that can make you feel like you were almost in the story. Shivers will go down your spin once you find out what Matt the clone is going through. This book is a very wonderful book because it holds your interest from beginng to end.
5,This book is GREAT,"One of the first things you notice about this book are the many award stickers on the cover. Now, I don't usually pay much attention to these stickers, as I've read many that were complete losers. But in this case book deserves all three of those awards, and more besides. This book stays with you long after you've read it. I won't go into detail because one of the best things about the plot is that it keeps you in suspense. You will be as uncertain about the future as Matt himself, the young protagonist. He has a hard life because he is a clone- he legally qualifies as livestock. But in addition to enemies and betrayers, he has good friends, and the story of his life is one no reader will soon forget."
3,good beginning but the ending lacks a punch,"She writes very well and I was hooked, reading without a break. In the end I felt disappointed because the plot didn't come together. The finale felt improvised - with the author trying to somehow tie all the strands together and doing a less than stellar job. So this taught me that being a good writer is not just a matter of writing darn good sentences; you must also put them together in a story that hangs together all the way."
5,"hands down, one of the best books I've ever read",Sometimes a young adult book is more than that- it's a story told with a welcome economy of language and space. This is one of those books. Excellent. And it doesn't read like the first part of a series/franchise that an author was forced to agree to in order to get a single young adult novel published. Mature and intelligent without being creepy or inappropriate. Nancy Farmer gives her readers credit for being intelligent and compassionate. Highly rewarding.
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"This book had my attention from page 1. I barely stopped reading. I was even sneaking off at work to read more! This book is tagged as a book for young adults or juveniles, but don't let that stop you from reading it if you are not in that age category. There is nothing juvenile about Matt's life. In some ways it reminded me of Ender Wiggin in Ender's game, which is a great book too. Both characters are children in age but not in mind.There was enough futuristic science fiction (mostly dystopian society stuff, which I love) to keep me interested and enough human interaction and emotion to keep me riveted and turning the pages quickly. And on top of that it was extremely well written and organized well as a story. Overall a great read. Don't let this one pass you by."
2,I didn't get it,"I truly do appreciate this book. I truly do. Nancy Farmer has a gift for creativity and I'm in love with the way she makes a blend of culture, sci-fi, and morality. This is a complex and thought-provoking novel, written quite well.That said, I still did not like it.It's dark, severe, grating, and hard-to-swallow. Which works well for many a book, but I'm afraid that it only made the end of this book all the more cheesy. And this is one top of the bizarre family connections.There's an icy feeling that connects almost all the characters, and I don't think Ms. Farmer properly escaped it in time to leave one satisfied.Thank-you, Ms. Farmer, for putting such incredible concepts into a YA book with your talented writing, but please do not expect everyone to enjoy this.Though I'm sure the right crowd will love it. I do not complain against its awards"
2,Juvenille Read,"A struggle to get through, too much remedial repitition, I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop... interesting concepts on the future."
3,It would be a better screenplay,"House of the Scorpion has a good plot, that's true, but there is one thing I have to say about it:It has about the worst writing of any book I have ever read. I am an enormous fan of all of Farmers other writing, but this one was a huge letdown. It eould make a wonderful movie, yes, but it is really a terrible book.I can not picture the scenes at all, and the dialogue is, I must say, rather lame.I do, however, urge readers to read the book, so they can draw their own opinion."
2,I know many people will not agree with me...,I hated this book. Everyone i talked to loved this book but I felt like it slogged along and had to much strange details on things I really didn't care about. It had a huge part of the book totally uninteresting and the ending was kind of strange. It also seems like the author had too many bad things happen to the boy; which made it lose a lot of what I love about books- getting lost in another place.
1,Horrible,This is a horrible book. I hate it. I know 3 kids that read it and all of them hated it. My teacher recomended it but shes a wierdo. I think they should stop selling this book. Dont waste your money on this piece of crap.
4,The House of the Scorpion,"This book is really good. It has a Newbery Honor Award. The book has a lot of suspense and mind bending moments. It is about a boy who is special but is really weird. Some kids named Emilia, Steven, and Maria went to this old house and found this kid named Matt. He fell out of a window and got glass in his foot. Then they take him to the Alacran Estate. There is mean maid named Rosa that treats him very poorly. She makes him do chores that he can't do because he is hurt. That is what I don't like about the book. The rest you need to read because it gets better and better. I would recommend this book because it is awesome."
4,"Good Book, Thought Provoking","I read this as my b/f had it sat on his shelf and I wanted something to take on holiday. I thought this book was very well written. I liked this book a lot. The main character is written well and as you see him through his whole life, you get very close to him. I also like the small injection of romance, this makes him all the more human. A lot of this book has you upset at how unfair his life is. Very interesting questions and issues raised. Definitely worth the money, read it."
4,Good but not great,"A good read for teen or someone interested in dsytopian literature. My only complaint was there seemed to be only vague references as to how society came to this point and why. Personally, I like that part. I am not expecting a history but some more references towards it would have been nice. My only other complaint is the ending seemed rushed and not fully explained. The book was a bit wordy but the end just seemed to clean and hastily put together. Overall, it was enjoyable and worth the time and effort, but for those of us who came upon this book based on The Hunger Games or Divergent, it fell a bit short."
5,this was an extrodinary book!!!!!!!,This book was one of the greatest books i've read in my life. It's so extremely different f rom all the other books I have read. i picked it up thinking it would take forever to read and i read it in less then 2 days. this book is great i recomend it for everyone.
3,scifi meets 100 years of solitude... or so i thought!,"I got really excited after reading initial chapters. I thought this books is scifi meets 100 years of solitude (spl. after looking at the family tree). I didn't turn out to be that way. Some aspects of the story were left unexplored. Mr mcgregor, felicia, tom, maria, her mom, political environment in the world, why did maria love the clone so much etc. I would have appreciated even more details about el petron.The story was really intriguing. But in the end book is just a good read ( a page turner albeit!)Its not a classic."
5,AWESOME BOOK,MY SON READ THROUGH THIS IN A MATTER OF DAYS HE WAS 10 AT THE TIME. SHES AN AWESOME AUTHOR HER BOOKS ROCK!
5,House of the Scorpion,"I LOVE THIS BOOK!. it has all the elements of a wonderful book, betrayel, deception, love, EVERYTHING. if u were to read this book, you would get lost in its pages the first time you read it."
5,An inspiration to all writers,"When I started coauthoring the Firefighter Story (working title), I spent many hours reading young adult books. Nancy Farmer is my favorite author. I've read all her books except her latest one, which I am looking forward to read. I also like the way she played out science fiction and fantasy. I was always a hard core science fiction reader, with engines and rockets and what not, but this is real cool and it also relates to real ethical issues that we are dealing with today. So the science is cool and the characters are great. It's scary though and I was amazed at how it was considered a young adult book. We at Quality Parks, a conservation charity, aspire to her writing style when we tell our story about five teens joining the fire department as a community service."
4,I enjoy the book but wanted more from it,"As both an author and reader of fiction I was impressed with (The House of the Scorpion."" The characters seemed real and the story line was a good one. I guess I have always enjoyed books that could hold my attention and make me think at the same time. I recommend this book. But I thought it could have been more.Tommy TaylorAuthor -The Second Virgin Birth"
4,"""Red Scorpion""",The House of the Scorpion.By Nancy Farmer.The book I am reviewing is the House of the Scorpion. This book is a science fiction. It takes place in a land bordering the United States and Mexico. What takes place there is a powerful drug lord grows clones for spare body parts that he may live longer. This book is about one clone's will to survive. The book tells about his story.My impression of the book is that ot deserved all the awards it won. It was very well written. I think the book is best suited for children ages ten to fourteen. As I was reading the book I almost couldn't put it down. It was one of the very best books I have ever read.
5,best book ever,"This is the best book ever it is totally worth reading, when anyone asks me what's my favorite book, this is always the first one that comes to mind"
3,The House of Scorpion,"The book was great, but the ending seemed like it should have another book (series)."
5,Such an AWESOME book!!!!,"Wow, this is such an awesome book. It has action, adventure, and love. If you are having a hard time deciding between a different book and this book, GET THIS BOOK!!!! I cant tell you guys enough. I LOVE THIS BOOK! It just might become your favorite book. If you are a person that judges a book by how many pages it is or by its cover.... Dont judge THIS book! Its such an awesome book. Ive read a few other good books, but this is the best one.I got this book a few weeks ago and I just finished it. WOW...Hope you guys take my review into consideration. THANKS!!! :)"
3,Interesting storyline,"This book had a very good plot, but it wasn't well executed. The book started out very good, but then seemed to drag throughout most of the book. At the end when the book picked back up and lots was happening, it seemed extremely rushed. All in all, it is worth the read."
3,Perhaps the awards are for the topic,"This book boldly, and somewhat carefully, takes on the hotly contested issue of cloning. It certainly doesn't do it in a way that takes a stance one way or the other, but instead, the author has tried to envision how clones might be used and treated in some possible future. This story was was average, but I finished it feeling I had read 2 or 3 different stories sort of strung together. It's not that the timeline and characters didn't flow, it's just something about how the different phases of the boy's life seemed disjointed. And for some reason I could never really connect with any of the characters. If you like books that have a bit of an original slant, make ponder about new and difficult subjects, then you'll probably enjoy this book."
1,Anchors away!,These anchors broke in half almost immediately after being inserted into the ground! We tried all four and all four broke. Maybe they would work on extremely soft soil--we live in Kentucky with clay soil. I would not recommend.
1,Long Hard Summer and Still Anchored,"I bought this set with some trepidation after reading the other reviews, but I needed something to keep our swingset from tipping when all the neighbor kids played on it. We have a small swingset for our 2 year old, but 3 or 4 neighbor kids play on it daily. We live in an apartment.I got the set and went out with a hammer, small screwdriver and a huge one. It took a while to install, and a lot of pounding, but once they were in, they were in. The 8 year old was my Official swing tester, and was going almost as level as the top of the swing and the legs barely moved. Before, anytime she would swing, the swingset would threaten to tip. Now it is very stable.You have to realize that once this is installed, it is there to stay........when the crew comes to cut our grass, they mow around and under it, then use a weedeater to get at the rest. There have been no complaints about that.This gets an A+ from this Indiana mom."
3,Auger Anchor Alternatives,"A few months ago I decided it was time to purchase some type of anchor device for my swingset. My girls were getting older and the ""swing tipping"" more severe. I had a neighbor who had purchased a set of Auger Anchors and was surprised how difficult they were to install. Also, I was looking for some flexibilty/mobility for my swingset because I have always moved my swingset when I mowed the grass. The Auger Anchor wasn't a great solution for my need for a mobile swingset.Interesting that the SwingSafe anchoring system was mentioned on this board because that was exactly what I purchased. (by the way, I have a slide on my swingset and I didn't have a problem using SwingSafe)."
4,Worked Fine For Me,"I live in MI and we have a clay base, so the augers secured solidly in the ground, but these would not work well in sand or rock. I alternated tapping with a hammer and turning with a screw driver wedged in the ring to get it started, and then just turned them down the rest of the way. I made sure I used the tightest holes as possible on the bands, so the bands secured tightly to the poles after tightening the screws. You could also drill holes and screw the bands to the poles, but this was not necessary for me. They give you 2 bands per pole, but I just used one band and wrapped it around the pole and secured it directly to the auger ring on the inside of the pole. They are doing the job for me and I have no complaints. It took me about an hour to install them, and it wasn't very hard. If you have compatible ground, then go for it. Much easier than digging holes and pouring cement. The SwingSafe looks like a great idea, but it would interfere with my slide."
1,Swingset Anchors Difficult to Install,"I live in Utah with rocky hard clay soil, so it was difficult to put the anchors into the ground. ""screwdriver method""? -I don't think so! I ended up using a ""water key"" (the tool sold at most hardware stores for turning water meter valves) and it worked quite well. It would be better to have two people, one to turn and the other to guide the anchor, but I did it by guiding the anchor with my foot while turning the key. The anchors plowed around rocks a bit. I didn't get the straps tight enough at first and so I had to go back and re-tighten."
1,New solution for Augor Anchors,"I purchased a set of Augor Anchors for my metal swing set. It looked very easy on the box, but the steps for installation were complicated. My soil is very hard and it was nearly impossible to get them into the ground. I have come up with a new solution called, SwingSafe. You don't have to put anchors into the ground anymore."
5,'How To Build Your Ideal Practice In 90 Days,"This book is very ""hands on,"" leading the reader through a step-by-step process that, if followed, will lead to positive results. The main challenge anyone has in develop a successful practice in anything is TIME, and David Steele's book is a definite help in using that time wisely and for maximum positive effect. I found it most helpful in beginning my coaching practice, and I heartily recommend it."
4,"Good, quick, read.","Very good book. I also enjoyed the fact that it was a fairly quick read. You take the quiz, and then you read up on which personality style you are. It had great information, and a great prespective in all. And if you decide to (as I did) you can also read up on all of the other personalities, for more insight, and information. And with being a Mom of 3, it was great that I could read it, put it down, pick it back up and read some more, and not feel ""lost."""
5,great dvd and series,"Hello,this is a great DVD definitly true, and similar to I highly recommend all of the dvds in the Secret Nasa Transmissionsseries there is a total of four dvds I hope more will be made. You will learn a lot if you are into ufo's and life in space.the vide sometimes isn't that clear and you can tell some of it was dubbed from vhs but I highly recommend it not for the videos but for all of the content espescially the commentary"
1,Worthless to Anyone With a Discernable IQ,"Produced in the grand tradition of ""Alien Autopsy"" and ""Conspiracy Theory"". The SOLE purpose of this production is to get you to part with your money via the ploy of sensationalistic claims. If you believe everything you read in the supermarket tabloids, then by all means, go for it."
2,ok but regualr is betta,its strai but chopped and screwd is not for all albums like this one so ya should like get rid of this **** and keep the reguar version
1,im not on drugs,"i not a fan of chopped and scrwed at all well first off all, the rappers original voice sounds exactly the same as if you were to do it to any other artist, hell you can even chop and screw gwen stefani's album and it would sounds exactly the same, and if i were to screw gwen's album, is it considered a down south album?? chopped and screw might die out one day as i can see the artist doesnt sell well when they make a scrwed and chopped album."
4,QUITE A DISTURBING ASIAN MELODRAMA,"Far from being an intellectual reflection on infidelity, this asian melodrama takes a simple subject and handles it similarly. There's nothing complicated in it, it's easy to follow and half way you realize that what you're watching is simply an old-fashioned soap opera, similar to the mexican and venezuelan TV soap-operas shown after lunch for a housewife audience. Don't misunderstand this judgement, since the movie works wonderfully. It's beautifully done (the photography is excellent) and the acting is priceless. Most of all, it is great, great fun. Give it some time, you'll really enjoy it."
3,3.5 stars,"3.5 stars.The ending, too over the top and just killed it for me. I will say it is worth a watch."
2,the housemaid,"it was made on an often used subject.the subtitles are ok,but it just didnt interest me. also seemed to drag"
3,Good but not the best one,"The acting was actually really good especially when the main actress burned herself in front of her boss and family, but I don't really understand the ending of the movie."
1,Dont Waste Your Time and Money,"There is nothing thrilling about this movie, it was just a fatal attraction between the housemaid and her rich employer. She did not get anything out of the relationship and ended up killing herself. If you call that a sweet revenge, I call that stupidity. Sorry , I have nothing good to say about the actors because I have seen a better movie."
2,Weird movie but hubby likes it,The story is just ok but a little weird for me. Not my cup of tea. I can't understand the ending
4,"An Interesting ""Class Struggle"" Film","This film delves into several different subject areas - extramarital sexual affairs, class struggles, abuse, neglect, social status - too many to list - and it often ""drifts"" - but the lead actress does an excellent job of focusing you back on her situation, and her efforts to build her life (or her failure to do so). Intriguing storyline - and a good overall job of acting, filming, scenery and plot development. Subtitles are well-handled, also."
5,Man that was great,"Never watched a foreign film before, but this is a good movie. Kind of crazy but in a good way. If you want to watch something a little different I suggest you take a look at the The Housemaid."
4,movie buff,very good quality and well packaged. the movie was well type cast and the story line was engrossing. a good movie
4,God buy,"These batteries were a very good buy, they come individually packages so you can just use what you need and easily store the rest."
4,Don't Listen to the Naysayers,"I just used this sprayer to paint a bunch of doors and it worked great! Before buying I read the reviews on this page and decided to take a chance despite the bad press, and I'm glad I did. I followed the directions and it worked as advertised.Having said that, I can understand why some folks would be upset with it. It is sorta heavy. And it is kinda noisy. But so are all the other power tools I own. It ""might"" splotch paint if not used properly, it does occasionally clog, and it does take a lot of time to clean. But I rented a spray gun and compressor and it too was loud, heavy, noisy, splotchy and clogged. And I spend more time cleaning it then spraying with it. The Wagner is well worth the price, especially considering rental prices. Read the directions, thin the paint if you have to, and enjoy. It's really not that bad of a product. Seriously."
1,Don't bother,"If you want to spray latex, this thing can't handle it.I eventually ended up heaving this piece of s--- out the window. No joke! Don't waste your money if you are looking to spray latex with this thing.It doesn't have the suction to deal with that heavy of a material, so you've got to thin your paint. But if you thin high quality paint, guess what you end up with?And even so, it ended up spitting these globs of paint everywhere, but only intermittantly, so you keep trying. You take it apart, clean it, oil it, put it back together, it works for a bit and then pslat! Another glob.Either rent a professional spray system or stick with a roller. It'll save you a great deal of frustration."
2,What happened to my tan?,"If you enjoy time in the tub, you'll love this sprayer. I was attempting to paint acoustical textured ceilings with this painter, and I type this review while staring at my pasty white-painted arms. I picked mine up on clearance at Wally World, and it's going back there tomorrow. I can't say that I'm surprised that the painter couldn't handle ceilings, but it was worth a shot. The real determining factor in the low review and its eventual return to [store] is the fact that it didn't perform well in a horizontal position either. The spray pattern couldn't be adjusted properly, and the number of strokes for complete coverage will wear your arm out. If you truly need a sprayer, fork out the big bucks for a piston pump sprayer......I'm going to."
1,Wagner Wide Shot - Don't Waste Your Money,What a POS. I've done auto refinishing so I'm very familiar with spray painting. I got the Wide Shot for a gift and went to use it the other day and found it cannot spray latex paint. The Wagner CSR basically said it was all my fault and I need to experiment with different paint conditioners. My gripe is nowhere on the packaging does it say it cannot spray latex paint.My experience with this product (and their customer service) could not have been any worse. I threw the $80 gift in the garbage since I couldn't return it and knew I'd NEVER use it again. The only thing that sprayed from the unit correctly was water.
1,Don't bother buying Wagner Products,It would be a waste of your money to purchase Wagner products. The manufacturer doesn't back their products with a warranty to speak of. I purchased 2 Wagner... drills about 18 months ago for... each. Two of the four batteries died and both chargers will not work. Wagner states there is a 3-year warranty on the packaging??? I called Wagner and they said they don't support the product any longer. How convenient..They said the batteries only have a 1-year warranty. And they don't make the batteries any longer. They said the charging cradles only had a 1-year warranty as well. And they don't make those either. Some 3-year warranty!!!!!!!!!! I would stay clear of this company for fear they may stop supporting their products in the middle of your warranty period too.
1,Wear hear protection...,"Gheeez, what a nightmare. This paint gun is good for nothing else than scaring and waking up your neighboors. This thing makes so much noise that it's unbearable. I bought mine for a small varnish job on furniture. I tried it before with water just to test it. It was so noisy that I couldn't stand it. I tried to put it back in the case but I couldn't. The case is designed in such a way you can't put it back without breaking or bending something.Pay yourself a favor, don't buy this product. Rent a compressor and a spray gun or use paint cans to do your job. This is probably the worst product I've ever seen in my life and it shouldn't exist."
1,save yourself a lot of aggravation,"This has to be the absolute worst power tool I have. I would sell it but would feel too guilty. It would make a good spatter gun if it would do that consistantly. Seriously, save yourself the aggravation and rent/buy a good airless. It will no doubt go the way of the $ 15.00 brad nailer from Harbor Frieght. Bouncing across the driveway!"
1,JUST SAY NO!,Where do I start? Try holding this thing for more then five minutes and your forearm will feel as if it just did 100 curls with a fifty pound weight. Inconsistent spray pattern. Frequent cleaning of the nozzle is required. Small spray pattern makes a roller much more efficient and less tiresome. The clean-up process is ridiculous and wastes any time which you may have saved. Need I say more?
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the most frustrated that I've been with ANY product for quite some time. The unit is noisy and vibrates quite a bit. This wouldn't bother me if the spray quality was good. However, spray quality is very poor. Paint was basically spit out of this thing in large droplets. Adjusting the flow and nozzle positions didn't help. Paint thickness didn't seem to have any effect on spray quality either.There may have been something damaged on this unit. Although, I don't think so. If you must have a sprayer, buy something else or rent a good one."
1,Very tempramental mechanism,"I just got off the phone with the Wagner folks who informed me that the piston is rated for ONLY 7-10 gallons of paint before needing replacement... They also told me I shouldn't be using Behr of Kilz paint with it. Those will wear it out faster.If I knew this information before, I wouldn't have bought this product. Perhaps they should put it on the box."
1,Poor Product,I hate this sprayer! I bought mine to spray primer on dark painted surfaces and it couldn't handle it at all. After struggling all day with this disappointing machine I cleaned it up and and took it back. I'm glad it's out of my life. Rollers and brushes are easier.
1,Waste of money and time,"What is the best way to waste $80? Buy a Wagner Paint Sprayer! What is the best way to waste a day? Attempt to use a Wagner paint sprayer. The money is possibly replaceable, but the time is not, which is more important to me. I have used a lot of tools and I can honestly say this the worst tool I have ever used. I was not expecting miracles from an inexpensive sprayer, but from the short amount of time that this sprayer actually worked (about 2 hours), I was very displeased with the results. Save your money and time. Go with the low tech paint roller and brush!"
1,"Deceptively marketed as ""candy""","I like to get unusual or strange candies (often foreign) for my nieces and nephews for their birthdays, just to try for fun. This was one I thought sounded interesting to try. It literally made me nauseous for quite some time. If you're looking for tiny packets of salt, this is the product for you. If it's candy you want, keep looking....."
4,Lemon and salt,Pica Limon Candy has a little bitty kick I really enjoyed the flavor. Delivery was quick. I would purchase this product again.
4,great,It is a great game for 12 and above....took it to a New Years party what a hit for the adults.
4,Fun but needs updates,I remember playing this back in 2007. I had a friend buy it for me and it was fun when there was alcohol involved. I ended up giving it away to some friends and decided to have one hoping that it would be more modern. I remember how much fun it was but I wish they changed the look a little. It seems like it's easy to break and they should have different options on the music but overall pretty fun.
1,Total junk,"This is a great fun game if you are lucky enough to buy one that works and that does not break after five seconds. I bought one that stopped working after three days. A year later I bought another, it did not work right out of the box (lights failed). I exchanged it and the replacement was not 100% either (lights failed and one handle was poor). I am now returning it for my money back."
2,Needs some work,"The game was fun the first few times we used it. Then the start button stopped working. It would turn on and appear to work (the player lights would select and light up)but the actual game would no longer work(no music, no shock). I wouldn't spend your money on this item. If the manufacturer was to upgrade their design and parts to be more reliable, then I would say go for it. Until then, save your money."
4,shock review,"I bought this toy for my 11 yr. old for Christmas & he really liked it, so do his freinds. The shock has different levels so you can make it stronger or lighter."
5,Lightning reaction game,"This game is a LOT of fun! It is fun to laugh at the people who get shocked. When you get shocked it tickles, and when you get shocked on high, it hurts. It is really fun to play though. I reccomend it to everyone."
4,"Alot of fun, for a short time...","This product is alot of fun, but the craftsmanship left something to be desired. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my little sister and the toy began to have problems almost immediately. Specifically, the start button in the middle of the game cracked and made starting the game a challenge. Overall the toy is alot of fun, but it looks like a ten year old constructed it."
3,If it works correctly...,Purchased this item as a Christmas gift so it was not taken out of the box until then. We tried playing it on Christmas and it did not work so the item was returned. I have played this elsewhere and it is fun - and funny!
2,Save your money,"When it works, it's fun. When you start playing it you can hardly feel anything (this is on the highest setting). after a few times you can feel the shock. There are times when only 2 or 3 of the handles are working."
1,"Seems like it would be fun, if it worked","We saw this game at a recent party. Although the owner had problems getting it to work, it did at various times during the party, and seemed like fun. We ordered one and it's non-functional. Multiple sets of brand new batteries couldn't get it to function. It would, at random times, turn on and show two players. The Number of Players button didn't function. The Start button would light up, but pressing it didn't start the game or have any effect. The Game Selection button had no effect, and the Shock Intensity level didn't do a thing, because it never got to a point where it would shock anyone. In this day and age of solid circuitry, you'd think a game this simple would be extremely reliable. Unfortunately it isn't. We returned this unit and won't try again."
1,Mom,The Shock game was a complete let down. We don't even think it works and the construction is shotty.
1,Rip Off,Receieved toy and gave as a gift. It never worked. Now I have to return it and I get a portion of the money back. Rip off
3,pricey,This toy is a lot of fun. BUT I don't think its worth the $32 I purchased it for. It seems very flimsy and cheap. It should have cost $15. We'll see how long it lasts.
1,Great game if it is working,"I had this before and gave it to someone, because they liked it so much and the excitement it creates. Unfortunately it is not built with quality and does not last. The one I gave away started going bad and i thought it was a single occurrence. unfortunately, this one was faulty on arrival. Everything worked instead it did not shock. If the item worked and lasted, I think it would get many stars"
3,Worked but one of the lights was broken,"Took this out of the box immediately and started to play. It was tons of fun, but it seems that one of the lights was broken and we couldn't figure out if we had four people playing or not. This product is not made of high quality materials and I don't expect it to last very long."
5,HYSTERICAL!,"This game is so funny! It was the hit at our family Christmas with the boys, young and old! It took some testing to see how to not get shocked, but it was really funny to watch! I recommend to anyone with boys in the house or anyone who likes to play pranks on their friends via torture."
2,Constantly running diag tests,Worked for about a week then after that during use it would shutoff and start back up into diagnostics. Even put new batteries in and does the same exact thing. Needless to say i'm glad i purchased the replacement plan.
4,So far so good,"So far so good. I received the item quickly and have not had the time to configure it. Just this past weekend I started to configure it and so far so good. Working on the Macro part of it and I am sure it will be simple once doing it a few times. It is not as fancy looking as the3 Logitech remotes, but for the price you cannot compare."
1,False Product Description,"The product description states that the CPTK1 transmitter works with all LiftMaster Security + products. This is not true, as it did not work with mine. Upon discussion with the seller, I was informed that I had bought the wrong remote. So I am out my time and postage for the return due to this misleading product description."
5,Thoroughly light and enjoyable.,"Wonderful movie. Full of Bowery Boys adventure and mishap. Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey were a great team bringing laughter, comedy and outrageously unlikely situations to always happy endings. I would recommend this video to everyone as a great introduction to the Bowery Boys. My only wish would be that there would be more of this movie series offered."
5,If your kids like bugs then this is it!,"My 3 yr old daughter is facinated with butterflies. We checked this out at the library, but after endless reading, we bought it. It gives great scientific info. in a way kids can understand. After reading this, I just wanted to get all the books in the series (there's a dozen). If your child is interested in bugs- bees, worms, fireflies, spiders, etc. these are the books to get! A++"
1,I've heard better. Really.,"I've heard SO much better from other new artists! What ever happened to real country music? As I was listening to his songs through the clips, my dog started to howl. The ensuing stomach ache I received after the fifth song did nothing to enhance my palate for his music. Fortunately, this was his first - and hopefully last - CD. Dude, stick to your day job, which isn't singing. PLEASE!!!!!"
4,How I Came to be a Writer,"As soon as I finished reading this book, I wanted to tell everyone how wonderful it was. I told myself, ""I'm going to write a review for this book on Amazon.com!""Perhaps I found it exceptionally wonderful because I hope to be a published author some day myself. In her book, however, Naylor writes, ""This book will not tell you how to write."" Maybe not, but reading about HOW she became a writer is very helpful. There are many examples from her earlier writings and examples of editors' feedback. I found both to be helpful.Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has a wonderful story to tell, and she does it well!! She inspired me to write for five hours once I finished her book. I strongly recommend it!Lori in New York"
3,"It is about the life of Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, an author.","This book is very interesting if you like biographies, and is perfect for all ages. She talks about her childhood of writing and making up stories. She says that at first she didn't understand how to read and she thought all of the kids were just making up a story that went with a picture. She also talks about eating her sister's chocolate bunny and having to wear awful boy's clothes! She later on discussed the steps she took to become the marvelous writer she is. When I read this book, I found out that she wrote a series of humorous books on ""Alice"". The ""Alice"" books are now among my favorite. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves to read and write."
2,Hmm!!,"These are a great idea but poorly executed. The magnets are set back inside a metal housing, if you stick them to a fridge or, as we do, the inside of your metal door, expect scratches! The magnets are not as strong as the 8 mini clip magnets, which incidentally are set back in a rubber housing and do not scratch at all, and are therefore not as practical."
2,Weak Magnets,"I am a big fan of Oxo products and I ordered these clips to hang up pot holders and oven mits. Though the clips themselves are strong, the magnets that hold them to the stove or fridge are not. I guess they could hold up kids' art work, but nothing much heavier. My oven mitts just fall to the floor."
1,Very weak magnet - only useful for holding the clip on the fridge,"I have the small version of these clips and use them to hold things in the clip and put them on the fridge. The magnets on the small clips are very strong.These clips cannot hold more than a sheet or two of paper as the magnets are very weak. I think they are best used for keeping a bag of snacks closed, and you can keep them handy by storing them on your fridge."
1,Worthless!,Weak Magnet! Won't hold a small potholder. More for a recipe card.Purchased a 4 pack for $7.99. I am now looking on Amazon for somethingbetter.
2,nothing special. don't pay for shipping.,"They function as advertised. They do clip. They do have magnets. Neither are very strong. The quality is not like the old Oxo products that had a signature heft and tactile appeal. These are cheap plastic...lightweight.I won't return them. They are as good as any generic product you'd buy in a grocery store. But, definitely not worth paying any shipping. If you have free Amazon Prime, use it."
1,Magnets,"The magnet in these clips is too thin. They are thinner than the cavity it sits in. The clips do not stick to a magnetic surface well as the entire magnet doesn't touch the metal surface. The clip itself is fine, the product just needs thicker magnets."
2,Wagner Power Roller,"I would not recommend this product. I bought the corded model (Roll Fast Power Roller). Out of the box it applied the paint evenly and much faster than I could have using a manual roller and 5-gallon bucket. The biggest drawback was in painting the ceilings as the wand was heavier than a manual roller and I had to apply more pressure on the roller to distribute the paint. Another drawback to the product is the roller system itself. The rubber gasket on the roller arm, which seals the roller, rubs against the roller creating resistance which must be overcome during painting. Another drawback is the clean-up which took me over 45 minutes (despite a 5 minute claim on the box). Finally after 3 hours of painting I had to quit using the tool when dried paint prevented the roller cog from turning. The pluses for the tool are (1) it is definately much cleaner to use and (2) it does apply paint evenly. But I am going back to my five gallon bucket, screen and manual roller."
2,It's sitting in the yard right now,"About the fourth time the tube popped off the container and I watched paint squirting onto the floor, I took the whole thing outside, poured the paint back into the paint can, and resumed using the old-fashioned rollers. I will probably throw it away. I just opened it yesterday.Also, if you're working in small spaces, this roller, with its somewhat long handle, will get in the way."
2,Huge clean-up time cuts how useful it is,"It does cut the rolling time in half as advertised - perhaps even a bit more than that. Cleanup, however, must be done obsessively (or the machine is ruined) and takes at least an hour (with latex paint - I dread the idea of cleaning oil-based paint out of this). The end result is it is only useful if you are rolling a really big area (say, at least 2 good sized rooms), otherwise your total time will be less with a hand roller.And you really need to be sure of the cleaning - my in-laws borrowed it and claimed they cleaned it per the instructions - and it looked clean on first blush. But there was a bit of paint in a tiny area that ruined an (essential) tiny spring piece (not sold on amazon or in stores) - and it no longer operates at all."
3,Use It Or Lose It,"The central theme of this out-of-print ""How to..."" book is: ""Use it or lose it"". Usually attributed to muscle power and physical fitness, the above axiom applies to the use of our brain. The book advocates for a high level of both physical and mental activity. In fact, as we grow older it is imperative that a physical exercise program be incorporated into our daily lives to reverse the mental decline of normal aging. The book explains in simple terms the brain and how it works, the nutrients required to keep it healthy and the behaviors to avoid in order to maintain peak performance. Absentmindedness, memory impairment, concentration, stress and creativity are just some of the issues the author addresses. While not an in-depth presentation of brain function, this book is written well enough to encourage and motivate readers in this era of Alzheimers awareness to become vigilant caretakers of the most important body part,the brain."
2,Roll-over,"This toy is very difficult for children to balance on, and therefore they tend to fall off very quickly causing much frustration."
3,Pool Mom,"We bought this pool toy for our daughter, and she was thrilled!!! But after being on this toy one time we now call him the bucking bull. Good luck staying on the silly thing. Now my child sits and hangs on to the handles and we pull her around the pool on it. My husband and I cannot stay on this thing either. Every now and then we bail on with sheer determination, only to be off in a matter of seconds."
3,"It was OK, but not impressed","My daughter did have fun with this, we had recently bought a house with a pool and she was excited to get one of these ride on type pool toys. My complaint was that it was not very stable, and tipped over quite easily, not really a good shape to stay upright I suppose. Potentially dangerous if your child is not a strong swimmer or if it tips over too close to the edge of the pool. I wouldn't buy another."
5,great,This pool toy is made very sturdy and is about 6 feet long. Easy to blow up and holds the air well. Great for adults and kids to ride on.
3,The Crocodile is Better,"We purchased this and the crocodile for a beach trip. Although the dolphin seemed more popular at the onset, once the kids realized it just rolls over easily, they switched to the crocodile (which is long and flat so it has great stability).The dolphin doesn't looks as good in the picture either. Ours also developed a hole in one fin after the very first trip, making it even more unstable. In all, we wouldn't purchase again - the crocodile, however, was a great purchase and lasted the entire 2 week trip."
5,Great buy!,"I bought the dolphin for a camping trip, I love dolphins so I was on it most of the time in the lake. It is pretty easy to stay on and it is durable! Great buy and so cute!"
5,Not all sharks are JAWS,"Great toy,and looks way cool floating in the pool; also nice for older ppl to hold on to his handles to keep their balance."
5,Great fun for the kids,The Dolphin ride on by Intex has been loads of fun for the kids this summer. It has held its air well and taken quite a bit of abuse! Best for smaller kids size around 5-10 years. Also looks great just by itself floating alone in the pool. I am a dolphin lover and have no regrets on purchasing this item!!
1,Lasted a Few Hours,"Well this was a disappointment. My husband purchased the Intex Dolphin, it arrived quickly, we blew it up and it lasted just one day before it developed not one but two leaks. With two leaks we figured it wasn't even worth trying to keep on top of this situation.So can't recommend this float. It looked sturdy enough but couldn't survive being used by one 12 year old girl :(Pam T~(This product by Intex, which doesn't cost much more, was far superior -Intex River Run Tube)"
4,FUN BUT HARD TO GET ON,"I bought this dolphin together with the whale pool toy. My kids enjoyed it too but it is difficult to ride on. It keeps rolling over.The whale is more sturdy. I guess the way it was made. Dolphins are slimmer in size compared to the whale.Otherwise, my boys had fun with it too."
5,swiss grandson,"cute cute dolphin - purchased to send to a friend's grandson in switzerland. If the child is only half as delighted receiving it as the grandfather was in finding it on amazon, it is a huge hit!"
3,OK,"The Dolphin Ride-On is fun for a while, but doesn't hold my kid's attention. It is really hard for the little ones to stay on. It seems pretty durable, and looks nice in the pool."
3,I like the dolphin but they don't last long.,"We live on the gulf coast and I like to see the dolphin moving in the pool when the wind blows. It's really not made to be played with. It's hard to stay on but very funny seeing people try to stay on it. I just wish they didn't leak so fast! I guess I have bought 6-7 over the past 4 years from pool stores, online etc....."
2,Disappointment,"This was not a DVD of the exccellent Bombay Dreams show.The whole four hours are filled with the ""making of Bombay Dreams"" with about four or five video musical numbers from the show.Very disappointing!"
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed. I expected the DVD of the musical which I was looking forward to. Even all the songs are not included
2,cheated,"I wanted the soundtrack for the play and while i found that it showed this DVD with it so I bought it thinking it was a DVD of the play, when I got it today found out that the DVD was a behind the scenes and making of only not the play. Feel this was kind of misleading. The DVD itself is ok but not at all what I was looking for."
4,Excellent guide to the weapons of the fantasy world!,Excellent book with many diagrams and pictures on the weapons and armor
1,A hot but esquisit book known to mankind. Bad drawings!,One of those baby-books compared to all the other ADND books
3,"Arms and Equipment Guide (Advanced Dungeons&Dragons, Dungeon","I had been searching for this book for a while, so when I finally acquired it, I was looking forward to making the re-acquaintance with this accessory. On reading the guide more thoroughly I was both impressed and disappointed. Impressed by the comprehensive history, more comprehensive barding coverage, addition of detail, and expansion of the often dubious area of spear/pikes & damage they inflict. However, once the euphoria of looking in these areas and descriptions of weapons and arms, the document disappointed as a whole. It had little that would add practical elements to adventuring, and would probably only stand one or two thorough reads, weapon summary excluded, and that alone does not make for a lasting document. A great idea, but could have been advanced further then it has been in this production."
3,Interesting,"Interesting, but not as useful as I'd anticipated. Good basic descriptions of different armor and weapons. Would have liked more on the wonderous items and non armor, no weapon items."
4,very good results,"I have extremely severe arthritis in my knees and since I've been taking this product, I've been able to move better than I was able to before. Now in addition to this product, I've been able to get by with an occasional nsaid when the weather is changing. much better than before"
2,Nutritional Facts Incorrect,"The Nutritional Facts on this site state this product has 1200mg of Glucosamine Sulfate in 2 tablets. I just received my order and read through the supplement facts provided on the label and found it actually contains no Glucosamine. I purchased it thinking it had both ASU's and Glucosamine the combination of which has provided me with some relief for hip stiffness/pain. I will return this product, and continue to buy the product I have been using from the Vitamin Shoppe."
2,"Great ideas, Lousy execution","I agree with the previous reviewers comments.The book provides great ideas for hikes, and has informative text on the geology of the area, and even points you toward scenic trailheads. But the directions are lousy and convoluted. I have gotten seriously lost trying to follow.I'd advise people to buy this book, but when the authors' directions get difficult, backtrace your way to your car rather than relying on them. Better to walk the same trail twice than to get totally lost!Good hikes in here, though."
4,Missing the Point,"A couple people have said how they don't like that Arturo doesn't play trumpet as much as you would think. While this is true, this is what you see when you see Arturo live. He is incredibly versatile, world class in both piano and trumpet. On ""Blues for Diz, he has an extended scatting solo, which, again, is not him playing. But, like I said, this is what you will see when taking in a live performance from him.In short, what you are seeing here is versatility- Arturo solos on trumpet, piano, vocals, and percussion. How many other musicians will do that? If you're looking for an album that showcases the full package of what Arturo can do, this is for you. If, however, you are looking to drool over his trumpet play- and only his trumpet playing- try ""Hot House"" or ""Los Elefantes,"" if you can find it. This is a very solid live disc, and while the dvd could have been shot better, it is a welcome addition to the cd."
2,No no no no no....:-(,"I have waited for this album in about two months now, and I got it yesterday. I`m a BIG Arturo fan but this is not good man... I watched the DVD and I couldn`t belive it, I just wanted to cry. It do not sound like my hero at all... And its not so much trumpet playing here... Sorry Arturo, I love all yor recordings but this is just bad and boring....But he is still my hero...."
2,A disappointed Arturo fan,"This CD was a big disappointment for me. Simply put, too much band, too much of Arturo's piano, and too little of his trumpet. There are two songs, 17 minutes and 13 seconds to be precise, that don't contain any trumpet.With the execption of ""The Big McBop"" & ""Eastern Blues,"" the song selection is horrible. ""Rhythm of the World,"" which lasts over 15 minutes, has approximately 3 minutes of trumpet and flugel horn, thus rendering the song flat, boring, and impotent. This unfavorably contrasts with the studio version which is beautiful and moving.Unlike his other CDs I have, this one does not want to stay in my CD player.The DVD is also mediocre. The side view of Arturo is atrocious. Not only is it hard to see him play because of the distant view, his trumpet is frequently blocked by the cymbal. Not good.Overall, the CD and DVD are flat and boring. It's truly a shame."
4,Happy to see new books in the series.,I loved this series when Games Workshop first published them in the late 80s. I'm very happy to see the old books updated and back in print and thrilled that new books are being written.Long live Dark Future!
3,Deliberate and Plodding,"As a WWII buff, I love novels set around D-Day. Unfortunately, this book is not quite up to par. Elizabeth Marantz and Sam Taggart are Americans that are dispatched to London to investigate murders of two of the mistresses of high ranking American generals; generals who have intimate knowledge of the upcoming invasion of Europe by the Allies. Their task is to determine if the plans have been compromised due to ""pillow talk"". The premise is a good one (see ""The Unlikely Spy"" by Daniel Silva); however, this one just does not deliver due to a slow-moving storyline."
5,Mrazek Can Write With The Best of 'Em!,"Robert Mrazek's The Deadly Embrace is an excellent fast-paced thriller in which WWII-ravaged London just prior to the period of the invasion of Normandy is the backdrop for a search for a ruthless killer. Beyond Mrazek's ability to tell an exciting tale of suspense and intrigue, his special strengths are the ability to provide richly developed,very credible characters and to describe this period in history as if you, yourself, were right there with these interesting characters experiencing all the goings on. The Deadly Embrace deserves a much wider reading audience than it has attained to date. Hopefully, after reading this review you'll read this very enjoyable book and help Mrazek develop the reader base he deserves. I'm looking forward to Mrazek's next book."
4,These Guys Are Real 'Head Cases',"This turned out to be a lot more of a comedy than a horror film. Seeing shrunken heads flying around was pretty unique and cool-looking but a lot more funny than scary. That's okay; I enjoyed it as a comedy.There really wasn't much to this Grade B-horror flick expect a lot of voodoo nonsense, which was taken quite seriously in here. What a croc! Whatever, it's still fun to watch. and it's always satisfying to see a bunch of punks get what's coming to them as our headless heroes do to them n here, seeking revenge on those responsible for their odd condition.Talk about an original story! Fun stuff and I just wish someone would put this out on a Region 1 DVD. We'll all have shrunken heads by the time this ever comes out on disc!"
4,Friendship Growing side by side,"If you are looking to be a better friend or just get closer to the ones that you have then this is a great study. There are many great insights in here on how to have a closer friendship through God.I was amazed that in these 12 studies there were so many points to friendship that we may not pay attention to. At the end of each study is a section called ""Going deeper"" That really allows you to think about all you have just learned. In the Scripture reference that is given to follow, it really takes you back to the lives of those in it and allows you to think about how we treat are friends and neighbors. In reading the Scriptures that came with each study I found that had I not been doing this study I may have never seen the Scripture that way. I would reccomend this study be it for one or a group. It has great format and very well thought out questions. It will truly make you value the friendships you have by making them closer."
4,Great call,Works great for calling in owls and mourning doves. Sounds a bit plastic and hollow but still authentic enough to work. Have not tried it on turkeys yet as advertised.
3,Trip down memory lane,"This was a very basic Peanuts compilation that those who fondly remember the comic strip will enjoy. However, kids who are used to more high-tech animation may not appreciate it in the same way. I was also a little disappointed with how many times the word ""stupid"" was used. In fact, in one scene it seemed like that word was used in every single sentence which I think was unnecessary. Other than that, it was a great trip down memory lane when life was simpler."
2,Another half-baked single episode release,Please don't buy this or they'll never release anymore chronological sets. The main episode is on one of the sets I have (think 70's PT 2 And the Saturday morning shows aren't all that great from what I've seen. Not that the main episode is one of the better ones either....Please go back and release 1980's PT1 and then PT2.
1,Plane Does Not Work,"I got this plane and when i first tried to fly it it was vey unstable. We worked on it with experts and sent parts back to the company. The In Flight Stabilization system dose not work and we never pluged it in. after trying it for about a year, we finnaly bought a new airframe and moved all of the electronics and engine to the new plane. It ended up costing a hundred dollers more to purchace the new airframe. The work to build it took a few hours. You would be better off buying an airframe, engine, radio, and receiever sepratly."
2,dissapointed,"As a Christian parent, I was dissapointed in this book. I believe Dr Campbell is correct with his concepts...but there were not nearly enough clear, practical examples for me. For instance, he mentions that ""making requests"" is a positive way to control a child's behavior but never gives one example for what a ""request"" would sound like. I also found this true as he discussed anger management.I think he has a great concept but there just wasn't enough practical advise and examples for me. I also felt there was a depressing tone to the book as he discussed all of the societal influences at work against the family today."
3,Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing..,"These Jazz covers by The David Murray Octet are boring and are void of any emotion.They are professional and tight and certainly come up with different versions of the original.But different is not neccersarily better.They play with very little passion, something Dead music is all about.Murray him self is a talented player and may very well be a Dead Fan, but his Octet plays like they never heard a live Dead recording or have any interest in bringing some of the Dead essence to their music.This album is interesting to hear for one passing,if your on abudget bypass this album and get a real Dead album you alwayswanted to buy and explore.Trust me your money will be better spent and enjoyed.Get a Dead album from early 1969 and hear someReal Jazz Fussion and Improvising.."
1,"There's no music here, just a bit of noise...","It's just a documentary about Steven life, and his particular way to see the evlution of music formats (Vinyl,CDs and MP3). I`m not agree whith his position, because MP3 and internet are the newest form to show and hear music, and I think to refused new things, thinkin past things were better, is a wrong concept.There`s no music here. There`s just a live presentation of experimental music (music?) in noise form that don't like me. There`s no music without melody."
5,Generous and cool,"The title of this review is simple. It is a generous CD indeed, and that alone would make it cool. The 18th track is roughly 20 minutes long, with extra songs to delight (although their text isn't in the album contents). Gabe Lopez sings songs ranging from grunge to ballads, and his voice traverses such territory far more surely than many other singers. Don't let his classical background scare you off, because that just means he can sing and not scream higher notes. ""Everythings' gonna be fine"" is so simple and direct that you are almost humming it on first hearing as he is singing it. Each song has its own sound and direction, which eliminates the fatigue some albums cause (same old, same old, over and over). If you want to investigate a new voice and sound (and understand the words, too), try Gabe Lopez. Making this album engaging wasn't about Gabe, it is truly ""about you"" the listener."
2,Does Not Do The Story Justice,"Given the subject matter, it's a shame not to like this book more. However, there are so many typos that it's hard to enjoy the wonderful photography.I don't know where Bill got these great photos...it is amazing how they tell the story that the text cannot.There was only one Hupmobile. If only today's carmakers could foster the spirit of originality and independence that we once could take for granted."
4,A very good discovery,Razorback is a band who's CDs may not be easy to find for decent prices but they should be internationally known. I came across their latest CD on a different online site and was instantly hooked. If you are into heavy music with great vocals and melodies similar to old Whitesnake then this is the CD for you.
3,Hoop Soldiers,"This movie is definitely low budget, but you know what, it's fun. Nobody in the film is going to win an academy award, the fight scenes needed some work and so did some of the dribbling, but some of the acting is surprising good. I especially thought the actor that played Mason was fine and who knows, if he keeps it up he may find himself on the big screen someday. As far as low budget urban independent films go, I have seen worse. The soundtrack was great but the storyline needed work. Overall, the movie kept me interested the whole way through."
3,Great Looking Film & Music: Acting Uneven,"I thought the Cinematography and camera moves were great, and also the music was outstanding. Films like this are fun to watch because in the low-budget world film fans get to see new up and coming talent. A viewer must keep that in mind when watching this type of ""Drive-In"" film.Some of the actors were excellant, some were extremely poor. The direction seemed uninspired, at a low novice level. But despite that it looked and sounded great and was fun to watch.My bets are that we will see and hear of the Cinematographer, the Composer, and a few of the actors in future movies."
3,Gladiators Meets Low Budget,"The film would have been better if the budget had've supported its characters. It was set in Phoenix Arizona. Michelle comes back after her brother Tyrell is beaten on the CAGE BALL circuit. It's got too many references to AMerican Gladiator in it without the hemisphere. Then you see Sable beating up everyone, like a woman really has all that strength and gusto. WHat was the purpose for Shay? he was nothin but a womanizer and a wanna be hustler. Sable even beats up the Mad Man Mason..which is hilarious, because he says, You wont some bitch"" and she says, bring it on"" and she kicks him down to the ground. He is corny in the movie though, when he tells Vanderbilt, ""your last album is tight, and I aint tryin to jock you or nothin."" On top of that, NO ONE can dance in this movie, lol lol lol"
5,Good Stuff!,Talk about quality! This case is sleek in its design and the material looks of the highest grade and its magnetized closing feature was an added bonus. For 5 dollars this case is a must have and it fits my ipod 30gb perfectly. Amazon is really an excellent company and the I'm really starting to become addicted to online shopping thanks to AMAZON!
3,No toy,"Disappointed that the Gir toy was not included as advertised- when box arrived, a sticker informed me of the unavailability of the toy. I would have appreciated knowing this before my order was sent outOtherwise, house box and disc all satisfactory.In future if order is to be different to that advertised, I would expect to be given an opportunity to cancel order."
5,According to the item description,"This is just the extra disc with the special features on it, the gir toy, and the box.It doesn't include the three volume series. The box set that includes the series is about $90, which seems fair to me considering I paid $15 for each of the three volumes. So, really, they haven't ripped anyone off by releasing the box set after they released the three volume dvds. If anything, the people who bought the dvds before the box set came out are getting a better deal than those who bought the $90 box set especially since we can now buy the special features box set so inexpensively. I know I personally will buy this extension in addition to my dvd collection.Just clearing things up, hope that helped."
3,Kids Show?,I still think this show is funny in adult ways. If I ever have kids I look forward to watching this show with them.
3,THERE IS NO GIR...sadness,"I had the other DVDs and would have gotten this box set regardless, I just thought it was bad on amazon to list that this set still comes with the GIR figure when the sticker on the box says it's sold out.Anime Works also needs to get on the ball and replace the GIR figure with something. Hell I'd even take a Dib."
3,What's on this that I can't get on the Invader Zim Complete Invasion Box Set?,"What's on this ""extra"" disc that isn't on the ""Invader Zim Complete Invasion"" Box Set???"
2,RIP OFF,"This is NOT a boxed set! It's just a house shaped box, little plastic gir figurine (with red, not turquoise colored eyes) and a DVD of mostly AUDIO stuff like sounds effects and half finished voice over stuff. Unless you really need a box for the DVD's you bought SEPERATELY, don't get this."
4,Let's -really- not get confused...,"just wanted to point out that Reviewer: ""M. Sherry (San Diego, CA)"" (Completely complete, April 29, 2005) wrote a misleading review. The item you are look at now, for under 30$ is for the empty box, GIR figure and a bonus disc with crappyish extras.(...)THAT is the box, figure, bonus disc + 3 volumes of Invader Zim. For over $100. Just go by price if you're not sure which is which. Also, a few reviews over there are also misleading as to whether it's the full set or just the box.Just didn't want anyone to be further confused. As for the product, come on. It's Zim's -house-. Doesn't get much cooler than that. ^^"
2,No Way In Hell Worth $35,"Alright, lemme just say that I'm a huge Invader Zim fan, and I'm not giving this a bad review because the show is bad. Actually, I'm giving it a bad review because it's a rip-off! First of all, the box itself is crap. Basicly cardboard, and not good cardboard, because mine broke. I woulda expected metal or at least plastic for $35 Secondly, the DVD itself provides minimal features. A couple of audio tracks of unmade episodes, the ""uncut"" version of The Most Horrible Christmas Ever, which literally adds about 3 seconds to it, and a couple of other audio tracks of music in the show. Lastly, the SIR (no it's not a GIR figurine) figure is just a piece of plastic with a top for a head. It's not bendable, it's highly breakable, and it's really not there for much of a reason. This is really stupid to buy, though if you've got the other DVDs and you're a big fan want to put them in something cool looking, go ahead and get it. Otherwise, skip it."
5,Awesome stuff,"If you're a Zim fan, this is a must-have. Admittedly, the unedited Christmas special isn't anything to get excited over, but that's more than made up for when you consider all of the commentary tracks that you can play with the other episodes. It gives a whole new life to eps you've seen before. Definitely worth the money. And the GIR figurine's definitely a nice touch. I can't really find anything to get upset over about this collection; it's great, and definitely worth the money."
1,invader zim house box,"i was not pleased. the price was high and there was no extra Gir doll. basically it was 25 bucks for a cardboard box and a disc of extras, i thought the advertisement was misleading."
4,Pleasantly Confused,"I bought this thinking it had the entire series. Only when it arrived I saw it was only the House and the Bonus DVD.NO GIR FIGURINE!It seems they do not include the figurine anymore! (A sticker on the side was saying as much.But am I going to return it? I think not... I'll be buying the series in addition to this box set.It's a bit pricey for what you get, but I'm a fan."
2,The house is nice but not worth $25,"The house and the bonus extra disc is nice, but it's not worth the $25, in my opinion. I guess I got the other edition with the episodes that costs $100 mixed up and was expecting this to have the episodes. However, the house is cute and well I just now bought all 3 volumes of Invader Zim and it should be coming soon so I can put it in the house. It is an early Valentine's Day present for my boyfriend (who I've got hooked on Invader Zim). TG for Nicktoons Network for still airing Invader Zim!"
2,"Great Series, great SET, NO GIR!!!!!!","The box set even says there is a GIR figurine, but lo and behold, there is a cute disclaimer sticker saying no gir figure, well hopefully The Nick network will commission a new better DVD manufacture to re-release the SET with the GIR figure that is supposed to be there, shame on media blasters and AMAZON for leaving this cute little detail out"
3,Exclusive for REAL fans...,"This is the case for the other 3 DVD's, which are really awesome and a must for Zim fans. Unfortunetly, this set isn't as good as the rest of the DVD's. Yes, it includes a Gir Figure, but it actually looks pretty cheap, like you bought it in a Dollar store. It also comes with a bonus DVD, which contains just a few things: Xmas episode (cool, but it's the same as in Vol. 3), unfinished episode audio (funny, but it will never be the same without the images)... The box itself is made of plastified carton, don't expect a metal case like I did.Maybe the Box set is a bit expensive, considering it's not-so-fabulous contents and the products quality. Anyways, if you're a real fan and you already have the 3 DVD's, you should get it... If you just saw the series a few times, don't waste your money."
5,***MISLEADING***,"I bought this product for Christmas 2007. Unfortunately, I did not pay close enough attention as to what it was I was buying. No ones fault but my own. I didn't figure this out though until my second shipment because I called to get a repalcement. With the first shipment I had thought that I had been shipped an already returned product because it(the box) was not in the original shrink-wrap packaging and the ""doll""/extras video and what I had thought to be included-the complete set of cartoons on DVD's,was not in it. So, hence my call to customer service for an replacement. I, of course, finally figured out once I received the new shipment that, ""IT"" was only a house-shaped box & extras DVD. What about the ""doll"", you say? Well, they apparently don't include that any longer as per the sticker on the boxs packaging. So, Yes, I was wrong in not reading the items full description, although, I still feel it is misleading. I hope my brain lapse will help someone else."
3,great but something missing,"I like the house box and the special features DVD is all sorts of rad but, THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE GIR FIGURE! One of the first things i noticed is a sticker on the box telling me that the figure is no longer included. The company the produces it went out of buisness. So just don't be surprised when its not there"
2,NO GIR!!!!,"I bought this because getting this and the full series seperately were considerably less expensive. However, when I finally received this item there was a sticker on it saying no Gir figurine was included. The figurine was the only real reason I bought this item in the first, and there is nothing on the site saying the figurine doesn't come with it anymore."
3,The Book was better,I think that this could've been a better book if they stuck more the storyline of the book. The book has the story taking place in the 80s. Also I never pictured Wesley Snipes as Franklin. I think there should've been a younger actor portrayed as Franklin.
3,The movie is alright :(,"I really thought I was going to enjoy this movie, because Sanaa Lathan is one of my favorite actresses, but I didn't. I kind of wish I just rented it, so I would be able to give it back. I didn't like the story line, mostly because I couldn't relate to it. For anyone who is interested in low life men, and a whole lot of drama (in relationships),....Disappearing Acts is for you."
2,Desperate Acts,"I won't give a long drawn out account on why this movie was bad for me, but one thing sticks out in my mind. The characters tried too hard to me. I love Sanna Latham, but it seems like she was forcing herself to convince us that she was really romantically involved with Wesley Snipes. With all the ups and downs of their relationship, I was praying that they just chalk the relationship up as a loss and move on.After awhile it just get tiring ,you know, like a real relationship.I much prefer the book. This movie doesn't hold a candle to the book. The book is as real as it gets. Pretty much how things are today."
4,Book to Movie,"This movie was excellent but flopped if you're judging it based on how true to the book it is. The movie outlines the general ideas expressed in the book. Of course a movie could never duplicate the preciseness included in a book but the necessary events in the book are in the movie.Sanaa gives a stunning performance as Zora, an independant woman with ambition and a craving for some masculinity in her world. Wesley is Franklin, a man with a whole lotta ego, real-life problems and a weakness for beautiful women. Both Sanaa and Wesley are excellent in their roles. They give life to these Terry McMillan characters.Perhaps the greatest gift this movie gives us is the possibility that you probably know a few Zora's and a few Franklin's! And knowing that allows one to connect with the absolute reality of the film. Get it! I applaud HBO for bringing this movie to the screen."
4,Class Act!!!,One of Snipes better performances. The story line was realistic to what two individuals with different backgrounds can come together and find love but not willing to let go of past demons can cause separation in the end.
5,i love this movie,I love this movie and I was happy I was able to find it here on Amazon and at such a good price. I had no problems with shipping and the product work well.
4,Good movie,"Disappearing Acts is one of my favorite books. The movie was actually good. Granted some changes were made for the screen version, but they tried to stay close to the story as possible. Sana Lathan plays Zora, a teacher who really wants a music career. Wesley plays Franklin, the man who falls in love with Zora, but has to deal with the fact he has less education, less money, and he is not up to snuff career wise. The movie basically shows that no matter how in love, you can't ignore the differences in relationships. I thought Wesley did a good job in the movie. I'm looking forward to buying this one day."
2,Mis-cast...,"I tried to dig the movie, but I couldn't get over the way HBO mis-cast Franklin. I am sure those who read the book prior to watching the movie will agree. I can see where hbo was trying to go with this, but they sadly missed the mark.Sanaa as usual, was a joy to behold..."
3,The Book is Better,I hate watching a movie after reading the book. Cuz the movie is almost never as good as the book. The movie isnt bad but it could be better. Sanaa and Wesley are great actors and they are in this movie but I guess because I read the book it wasnt as good as I expected.
3,the book was better,"i liked this movie, but i enjoyed the book alot more. they both played their roles really well, but it was kind of boring at times to me."
2,Dissappointing!,"This book had wonderful potential. The story line was real but, the actual development of characters, plot, etc. was weak. This book dealt with the challenges, black females face due to the absence of a strong black man. The title of the book actually revealed the outcome. Franklin disappeared, which is typical of the black men today. They make babies...and don't even stick around to raise the baby! Better luck next time...maybe the sequel to this book could be...""Sticking Around""!"
2,Pointless,"I have never read this book by Terry McMillan but I am told and sure it is better than this movie. I felt the main character Zora played by Sanaa Lathan makes ridiculous decisions in hooking up with a less ambitious Franklin protrayed by Wesley Snipes, whose character is basically a lying bum. I don't see how any female can be manipulated by Wesley's performance, and on top of that, Zora thinks she is marketable in landing a record deal in her late twenties and pregnant with a child. There are a couple of scenes that are great but they are far and between. Director Gina Prince-Bythewood has directed a pointless film that does not do Terry McMillan justice."
4,Good Brotha-Sista flick,It is happening that when African Americans make films depicting themselves you get outstanding performances! Gone are the days of jive blackened white movies. Kudos to Wesley Snipes for a job well done.
5,great love story,Great price for a excellent movie! I am really pleased with the shipping time and the product. Sanaa and Wesley did a wonderful job on this project!!
4,"Disappearing Acts,","I loved the book Disappearing Acts, i read it in two days, i love the movie as well. we all know that when a book is turned into a movie it is never given its due, i do think that the movie did a good job, and it could have been better, but i enjoyed the book as much as i did the movie, if you love the movie pick up the book it will not disappoint you."
1,"Great concept, poor execution","Sorry to say this album just doesn't cut it. I tend to like cover albums like these, but this one seems like an afterthought in the production booth. Laura's original versions are far, far superior."
1,"nice idea, bad album","Laura Nyro had few peers, a fact sadly reinforced by the mostly mediocre, and often downright terrible interpretations of her work included in this compilation. All of her original recordings are available on CD, so why bother with this? I'm sorry I did. It's obvious that the artists meant well, but they don't come anywhere near the quality of Nyro's own versions of the same songs. It's an odd coincidence that Nyro herself did FABULOUS covers of other people's work, especially the girl-group songs from the '50s that she found inspirational. ""Gonna Take a Miracle,"" her album of such covers, a collaboration with Labelle, is still one of my alltime favorites, after what must be 25 years of listening. Her version of ""Up on the Roof,"" which is on ""Christmas and the Beads of Sweat,"" is far superior to the original. Which is not to say the original is not good -- it's great. But Laura Nyro took the song to new heights -- roof pun intended."
2,uneven cd,"This tribute to Laura Nyro is uneven at best. It features some well produced and interpreted cuts (Phoebe Snow, Jill Sobule), some straighforward and well done interpretations (Beth Nielsen Chapman, Roseanne Cash) and some perfectly awful renditions (Lisa Germano's moribund Eli's Coming and Dana Bryant's unlistenable Woman's Blues). I would not recommend it to anyone just getting aquainted with Nyro's work, but true fans may find it an interesting if uneven addition to their collection."
2,Dirge music?,"I finally got to hear this tribute album to the wonderful music of Laura Nyro. This album has very little of the joy of Laura's music. Except for Honey Cole's version of Sweet Blindness, the whole album sounds like a funeral. Most of the artist's voices were just too small to do justice to the music. Overall this is a very depressing album. I was sorely disappointed."
3,A very uneven work.,"Much like ""Tribute"" albums to great's like Curtis Mayfield and others, this album is uneven at best. This entire collaboration has a ""rushed"" feel to me. I dislike the fact that it's a woman's only album, secondly I think the fact that the average age of participants is so young is a serious mistake. Laura deserved an ""all-star"" tribute, not a [...]slap dab put together.A tribute album to Laura with no Patti Labelle, no Kenny Rankin, no members of the 5th Dimension, no Bonnie Raitt, no Carol King, no heavyweights? You gotta be kiddin' me!!!! Of the tracks listed I found three that I actually like. The version of ""And When I Die"" by Sweet Honey in the Rock is awe inspiring, as wonderfully different as it is faithful to the original. I also liked the renditions of ""Save The Country"" and ""Stoney End"". Other than that the album's a bust, nondescript cover's by unknowns. Sigh....What could'a, should'a been."
1,Be Careful,"This product doesn't fit many of the paint sprayers made by Wagner, including the new one I just bought. The odds are not in your favor. Don't be confused by the fact that both Home Depot and Lowe's will assure you they have looked it up in their computers and it is the correct sprayer tip. None of the Wagner sprayers sold either by Lowe's or Home Depot work with this tip. You are better off calling Wagner and discussing your needs before you buy this product(I wish I had). Wagner can sell you the right tip during your call. The Wagner people are very, very helpful."
1,Doesn't Fit,"I thought this stain tip would fit my new Optimus Project Sprayer, but it does not. I tried a couple of adapters, but the lengths were not workable. Am I missing a part or should the advertisement state that this tip does not fit the Optimus Project Sprayer?"
5,THE GREATEST THING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This doll is the best Barbie created by Mattel. I'm so happy to see these two combinations together. There are no pictures that will ever be able to capture the beauty of this doll. This is a total must-have for any Barbie collector or Wonder Woman fan!!!
5,This is my favorite!,I am a Barbie collector and this is by far my favorite. She looks exactly like Linda Carter in the old Wonder Woman show.After searching for this doll in several other internet toy stores and Ebay this was the best price around. I am very very satisfied with my purchase. I only regret that I didn't buy two. Will be looking forward to seeing this doll available again soon.
2,not as pretty as I thought,Barbie as Wonder Woman sounded like such a good idea - but I don't like how her make up is.
2,too small for motorcycle disk brake,The Chrome Disc Brake was suppose to lock onto the disk of a motorcycle brakes.... too skinny and couldn't get it on the bike; returned for full refund....don't buy this thinking it will fit on the motorcycle front disc;
5,She'll Take It,"This book is incredibly addictive!!!! It gave me the same feeling I get when I watch Sex & The City or eat chocolate, I just wanted more at the end! Loved it!!!!!"
3,Great Harmony!,Great Quality Cd and excellent harmony! I feel all CD's are over-priced though and for that reason I gave only three stars.
2,WORST OF THE PUPPET MASTER SERIES!,"I hated this title.Trust me look for it at your local video store,videorental stores,or on ebay.com.Trust me rent this film first.Puppet Master 1,2,3,4,6,and 7 are better than this."
2,NCLEX-rRN Made Ridiculously Simple,This book should only be used as an adjunct for study. Unfortuately there is nothing simple about preparing for the nclex. Your time would be better spent on understanding the test and taking practice tests.
4,Good for the little details,My daughter used this to help study for her Nclex. She said it was a good study guide.
1,Highly Disappointing and Misrepresented,"I was looking forward to this DVD, but was very disappointed when I played it. The instruction and production quality was very poor. The lead instructor seemed shy or introverted, as though she hadn't rehearsed enough on how she was going to instruct the viewers; so following her guidance became difficult and irritating - there just simply wasn't enough explanation, particularly in the latter half of the dvd, in order to follow the steps correctly. And her counting became monotonous, adding to an already visually boring dvd.I have the Zumba dvd and found that to be 100 times better - in quality of instruction, production quality, and content. The Salsa Solo is a lot cheaper, so I guess you really get what you pay for.It's apparent that the positive reviews, which were highly misleading and led me to buy this dvd, were from those that were part of producing this DVD, as no unbiased user would give this a positive review."
5,Santa brought me just what I wanted,"i am thrilled to say that Santa knew exactly what I wanted, and brought me just that, the Salsa Solo DVD from World Dance New York. I'd been eyeing it since it came out and was anticipating an amazing experience -- and that's what I got! I've done it twice since Xmas and not only are my ass and abs feeling firmer than ever, I had so much fun, learned a ton, and can't wait to hit a salsa nightclub in NY to show off these move. Bravo, WDNY and Yesenia Adame!"
3,Partially good,"The first part of the book deserves five stars; the second part gets one star, so I averaged them.In the first part of the book, the author explains science hypotheses and terms very well so that anyone can understand them.In the second part, he brings in the Maya (kicking and screaming?), and the book gets stupid. The pyramid-building Egyptians and the ancient Maya lived in different times and places and had nothing to do with each other."
2,going over old ground,"Disappointing. This is basically an overview of other's people's work and ideas. A good introduction to the general topic, but don't buy it if you're into this subject and have already read quite a bit about it. You'll be bored."
3,The Pyramids As Power Plants!,"Before the Pharaohs: Egypt's Mysterious Prehistoryprovides fascinating details of an advanced Egyptian civilization which actually built the great pyramids as geomechanical power plants, long before later pharoahs used them as mere burial tombs.Diagrams in the book help with a somewhat perplexing explanation of how these power plants worked. I have to admit I did not completely understand them. But according to the author, the tunnels and chambers inside the pyramids indicate a far more sophisticated culture than Egyptologists originally believed. This information, will only add to speculation that interplanetary visitors may have been responsible for such futuristic knowledge.Review written by Regis SchilkenAuthor of:Tears of DeceitOther reads:The Complete Pyramids: Solving the Ancient MysteriesThe Secret Power of PyramidsVoyages of the Pyramid Builders"
3,interesting but slow,"this book has an incredible amount of fascinating information, but it is not organized well. The writing does not grab your attention, but rather, you have to force yourself to find the interesting material. It can get a bit ""Von Daniken"" at times-- especially the chapter about the pyramid being a power plant, but overall it is a good, solid, informative book that challenges the typical archeological canon we are all handed. If you are willing to wade through it, you will find info that is worth while."
5,Excellent Reading,"A well written, easy to read manuscript. This book takes an expanded view of the many pervasive cultures and peoples which eventually led to the formation of Egypt. I would recommend this book to anyone desiring a better understanding of Egypt's pre-history."
2,Very dated - I just can't relate,"I like British comedies in general: Last of the Summer Wine, Keeping Up Appearances, and As Time Goes By are some of my favorites. This series just doesn't measure up to those, in my opinion. Times have changed a little too much to make Julia McKenzie's character (Hester) sympathetic. Her kids have left home and, since she doesn't have a job and her husband earns a good income, she now has time to indulge all her interests. I am a middle-aged woman with two small children and a full time job and also the primary wage-earner, so to me Hester seems to have the dream life. I realize expectations and opportunities for women were different in the '70's, but really, why exactly can't she find fulfilling employment? I got bored with her ""problems"" very quickly. On the plus side, Hester is much more rational and intelligent (and therefore more likable) than Lucy Ricardo and Jean from As Time Goes By."
4,Excellent second album,"Despite its anarchic title, the new Coopers effort is a tad more considered than their eclectic, sprawling debut 'See Through This And Leave'. On this album, they make further use of electronics and synths to create a smoky masterpiece of skilled and ambitious epics like the 8-minute 'Written Apology' and the building rush of 'The Same Mistakes'. There's even room for a ballad in 'Into My Arms', albeit one that mutates into vicious industrial noise towards the end. Fear not, though, the Coopers of old are still present on the fast and furious single 'Promises Promises' and the tuneful 'Blind Pilots', which mixes a Grandaddy-esque style in the verse with an explosive chorus full of energy and - shock horror - hope."
4,It's a riot from start to end.,"Where extra-marital affairs are a no-no, Weber gives a fresh and funny point-of-view of a lovable character torn between a steamy love affair and a secure marriage."
3,Something's missing,"So Eve is happily married, yet she risks it all for an affair that challenges every fiber of her being, as one reviewer put it. It must be fiction (?) because the novel avoids the real mess and hurtful emotional betrayals of extra-marital indulgences. Eve is hardly a feminist, but she is certainly selfish. It is entertaining to read, as unbelievable as it is."
4,Fun Shamu pool toy,"This is a fun Shamu pool toy. For adults, about the only thing you can do is grab the handles and sink down for a ride near the tail. But for the kids, they can jump on top of Shamu, glide across the pool and roll off with ease. Granted, its not as easy to ride as a raft or inner tube, but its fun for short bursts.It gets hot quickly in the sun, but its equally fun to see it blow in the wind across the pool as if jaws is lurking outside."
5,fun times,"This toy is so fun for the kids, they get a kick out of riding it, it supports even the big kids."
1,disappointing toy,"This toy was a complete waste of money. All three of my children (ages 10, 7 and 3) are unable to ride it. I even have tried to ride it. It is unbalanced and just rolls over. The only way to stay on it is to lean against the back flipper. The reason there are 2 people in the ad is because one person can not ride on it like the female is portrayed."
1,Disappointed!!,"I am very disappointed in this product! I ordered it thinking there would be know problems, and I was wrong. I ordered it back in March, 2012 and I just inflated it today (April 18th, 2012.) When I inflated it, it lost air quickly. Then I did it again and the same thing happened. It appears that there was a hole/leak in the float! I am very angry at this and further more, disappointed in the product. I am hoping to recieve a new Whale Ride on. Thanks!"
1,Not what I thought it would be..........,"I bought this for my nieces and nephews, ages 5yrs.-10yrs.Our pool is 27 ft. round and 52 inches deep. They could notget up on it, and when lifted up it was hard for them toget their balance. After a few times of it flipping overon top of them I took it out of the pool. I would notrecomend this to anyone."
1,Major Product Flaw,"This is HUGE! It is very back heavy as the front is high. More important...It is BLACK. In the hot sun, the orca turns into a dangerous animal, scalding to the touch and completely unusable. It is very well made however!"
5,excellent pool or lake toy,This was a birthday gift for our daughter and she loves it. It is more durable than I thought it would be. She has a lot of fun with it.
5,"really, really big","the material looks sturdy and it comes with an extra patch in case there's a leak somewhere. There are separate air compartments for the body and the tail, so that helps the air distribution when you apply weight to it"
4,Whale ride on,"Great fun for the kids, puts a bit of variety into playing in the pool. Good size and easy to inflate. It seems to be well manufactured and strong."
2,A whale of a Ride,"We purchased this Whale for the kids to use in a pool and river. It is cute when blown up and seems sturdy enough. However, it is misleading to show three young children on the whale riding it at the same time. We could barely get one child on it for more than a few minutes. It's shape is not condusive for lengthy use as a riding toy and easily rolls over."
5,A great ride,"You will fall off this, so have fun! The turtle you can get on and not fall in, but this is for a warm day pool fun."
5,Unseen Makhmalbaf,"Mohsen Makhmalbaf has had a few distinct phases. First there was the gritty-realist beginning (as in The Cyclist), then the self-reflexive cinematic portrait of Iranian society (Salaam Cinema and A Moment of Innocence), and finally his most recent, the painterly poetic phase. All of these are of interest, and it's too bad that Makhmalbaf - perhaps because he's tried several different styles - doesn't get the respect of Abbas Kiarostami.The Silence is one of the most visually striking films made in the last ten years, and though it's a visual masterpiece there's no denying that the imagery easily outdistances the slight narrative. Still, strange that this film remains so obscure. Shot in remote Tajikstan, it is one of the most remarkable bouquets of color I can remember seeing in a film. For anyone who appreciates the visual pleasures of the cinema or has an interest in obscure locales, Makhmalbaf's film is a stunning achievement."
4,Blind but finding happiness with everyday routines,"Khorshid is a blind 10 year old boy from Tajikistan who lives with his Mother, who is struggling to eke out an existence and desperately trying to hang on to their hut/home.Khorshid works as a tuner of music instruments. He is at risk of losing his job as he's often late. He has to travel a long distance by bus and by foot to get to work and he often gets sidetracked by voices, a drumbeat, the touch and feel of bread or fruit, or other sounds and experiences of everyday life in the city.Khorshid, while blind and poor, manages to find peace and happiness in his world.This short movie (75 minutes) can be ploddingly slow and the plot very simple - but the film is visually spectacular with mesmerizing and hypnotizing sounds. You move through the scenes with the blind boy as he experiences life. I find myself reflecting back on this movie weeks later so while the storyline was ""basic"" - the message hit home."
