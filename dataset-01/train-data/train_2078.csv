2,Not the same as the picture,"What is pictured is not what you get, nothing to hang it with, just one large compartment and one smaller pocket on the front. Nothing like what I expected."
5,True North,"If you really want to know what life North of 60 is like, read this collection. Admittedly, life in the large towns (Anchorage, Fairbanks, Whitehorse) is like any town, but anyone who has lived up north will know people who live much like Martin."
2,"Far ""short"" of perfection...","I have a nickname for this 25' cable... ""shorty""...This cable was somewhat okay for months (very faint hum when source was silent) for watching TV. But then developed a quite infuriating short in it, that I have to wrestle with to get sounding good again. This cable was not abused, by any stretch of the imagination. I take pretty good care of my things, and this was no different. Probably only took a slight bend at the end of cable to make this happen. Very cheaply made product, I think. I would not recommend this.It is all moot and my wrestling days are over. I am completely going bluetooth and will never look back (at long cables for headphones... or ANYTHING else I can go BT with)."
1,"Another masterpiece by Zulawski distributed illegally by POLART! 5 star for Film, 0 star for DVD!!",This is one the most haunting arthouse films ever made. Unfortunately it is getting released as a bootleg DVD by Polart - The DVD is Fullscreen (regular PAL-NTSC transfer from the Polish DVD presented in cropped Fullscreen) Zulawski's intended aspect ratio is 1.66:1.Keep your $30 and wait for a legitimate company to pick up this film for proper distribution.
3,Whine Around the Cape,"This book is a great example of how NOT to cruise. The challenges experienced by this couple were largely of their own making - somewhat a cruiser's ""No Exit"".All in all the book is about a battle of egos and self-fulfilling prophecies. The storm scenes are certainly page-turners and the book reasonably well written, but the people become boring with their self preoccupation.For a far better example of circumnavigating the Cape, I would suggest Hal Roth's book - ""Two against the Cape"". The Roth's enjoy and have respect for the region."
3,"Painful, but still worth the read.","After the first chapter, I was convinced I had finally met a sailing book I didn't like. I just didn't have the heart to stay with a few hundred pages of what appeared to be self indulgent whinning by the author herself about her husband, written some nine years after the event and done seemingly as self therapy. But I'm glad I stayed with it, because the story of the couple's nightmarish voyage through the Straits of Magellan (weather was only half their problem) did rivet the attention. In the end, though, this is a hard book to recommend, either to another guy, because he will feel like he's attending a self-help group about marital relations, instead of reading a sailing yarn and by no means to a woman--for whom this book has the power to truly terrify."
1,Worst book I finished this year,"If I hadn't been trapped on a long plane flight I would have thrown this piece of trash away without a thought. For a Harvard grad the author apparently hasn't learned much about research or the ability to accurately portray science. The characters are stock one dimmensional, the plot is ludricrous, and the background is just plain silly. I can easily allow for some literary license, but atmosphere can be best created through accuracy in details; the author fails miserably on this score (ie, his description of the hospital and ED settings...oxygen cylinders are always green, not orange, for example). I do appreciate his effort at attempting to find a scientific basis for the supernatural, but believe he should have thought it through more before commiting it to paper. His characters need a lot of work."
1,"Terrific premise, terrible writing.","Holden has a great idea (unless it's not really his idea, if you've read DAY AFTER TOMORROW) but he can't write. Lazy, cliched and sexist. I laughed out loud dozens of times at the lack of imagination in his dialog and description. Scared me nary a once. Too bad, too, because the premise could have led to a far more thought provoking experience. Read it if you must, but expect little reward."
4,A Guilty Pleasure - Cheesy but Fun.,"Even though the writing was kind of cheesy, I found myself unable to put the silly thing down. I ended up reading it all the way through in one night. I loved the premise, the writing wasn't that bad for a debut novel, but I hated the ending. I don't know whether the science was accurate or not, and frankly, didn't care. The idea behind it was fascinating.Would I read other stuff by this author after reading this book? Yes."
3,(...),"It was a decent novel that kept me turning the pages, although a below-average ending made me wish I would've turned the pages a little more slowly. The Heroine was way too smart, sexy, unemotional, and infallible. If you like to read about developing relationships, you'll be disappointed with this book. The villains are ghostly, totally ruthless Chinese who are too weird to find even remotely believable. Scott writes well, but I feel he wastes too much ink with overly detailed descriptions of a room and every piece of furniture, equipment, etc., in it. If the characters would have been a little more human and the ending a bit better, the author could've had a winner here. What I really trying to say is that this novel lacks real passion."
2,Gross out,"Modern science goes too far. Again. I had hopes for this book. It starts with an interesting premise but then it doesn't really go anywhere with it except into long and detailed descriptions of, well, gross stuff. And the bad guys, the super bad guys of all time, are the Chinese (big surprise there given our current economical/political situation with China). But their goal seems so small and uncreative. The plot starts out with high tech ambitions but it turns out to be so 1950s.And why does the heroine not only have a great body but a tongue that can perform amazing feats? Geez.If you're desperate for something that won't tax your own brain cells and you like reading about vaporized brain stuff, go for it."
3,Science was interesting but...,"I decided to read this book because of the intriguing idea of explaining a scientific viewpoint of ghosts. While I found the sections of the book that dealt with this aspect very interesting, I was dismayed with the cardboard characters. Why do all main characters have to be incredibly good looking, young, extremely intelligent, etc.? Especially the character of Amber, the CIA agent? Tall, beautiful, smart, fearless, you name it. Just once it would be interesting to have an action novel where the characters were a little more ""normal"".Otherwise, the book was paced well but I agree with the other reviewers that the ending left much to be desired."
3,Entertaining and Suspensful,"I give Scott Holden's debut thriller, ""Skeptic"", 3 1/2 stars. His novel seriously deals with the topic of ghosts and the paranormal. Mr. Holden skillfully weaves a tale of scientific research, political intrigue and the paranormal and ties them together very well. I found the book to be very entertaining, and thought provoking. The only downside is the realization halfway through the book that the heroine and hero are going to wind up in love and live happily ever after. Overall, the book is definitely worth a read."
5,A Real Page Turner!,"Wow! What a great debut from a promising young author. Scott weaves a tantalizing tale of mystery, suspense, and highly believable paranormal action! As a doctor, I am extremely intrigued by the concepts introduced in this book. I read it in one sitting, and will probably read it again. Scott is a thinking man's Crichton!"
1,Blech. Buyer Beware...,"I'm not going to put much into reviewing this, because, frankly, it's not worth the effort. The core idea of the story -- a scientific explanation of ghosts -- is a good one, and a very compelling tale could be written around it. Alas, this isn't it. This is a clod of leaden prose threaded with banal action and stereotypical characters lacking any depth whatsoever. Caveat emptor with extreme prejudice!"
1,Makes one yearn for the intelligence of Grisham.,"The hero, a medical researcher working on government grants, has ""The Collected Works of Ayn Rand"" on his shelves. Heroine 1 is a shy genius. Heroine 2 is an inscrutable Chinese described several times as ""exotic."" Chief villain is an evil Asian. All main characters have the state of their nipples described at least twice.The author claims he went to Harvard. Whatever else they teach there these days, it sure ain't creative writing. Predictable, dull, and obnoxious."
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"This book opens with a sequence of images which shows how good it might have been. Each image is given a full page, unencumbered with text, and thus obtains its full power. Unfortunately, that's where it ends, as most of the rest of the book is like looking through somebody's stamp collection, with up to 5 images a page!. There are simply too many images crammed in, so, instead of enjoying the prints for what they are, you are left wondering what they would have looked like had they been presented properly. This is especially unfortunate when you realise prints are an ideal opportunity to present the work as the artist might have wished - since, unlike paintings, they are actually intended for reproduction.So, useful if you want just an academic catalogue record of everything that is in the Marcia and Granvil Specks collection, but pretty useless otherwise."
5,Charming,This is a charming story told by a little girlabout her grandfather. They are alike in manyways. This is one of my daughter's favorite books.
4,Distinctive Voice,What struck me about In Search of Black America: Discovering the African American Dream was the author's tone. There is a feeling of treading optimism and genuine concern but not condescension for his subject--the places of black middle class life in the United States. I was reminded of the work of Albert Murray and Anthony Walton's Mississippi in that this book shares a similar impulse to try and understand black middle class life. In Search shows the presence of an author who is questioning but also brings sensitivity without the heavy handedness of a writer focused on elevating or denigrating their subject; one who is genuinely interested in hearing and seeing the people who he writes about.
5,Excellent Silicone Utensil,"This 12"" spoon is light-weight, but quality silicone that holds up well to high-heat cooking and is dishwasher-safe in the upper basket. Its length works well in tall soup pots. Its slim handle can be easily accommodated in the crock/jar on the counter with your other kitchen utensils. Paired with the KaiserFlex Silicone Blending Spoon, these are kitchen essentials. This is well worth the money."
5,NIce world/new age music,"I bought it by pure accident but it turned out to be very good, comparable to Patrick O'Hearn. It is a mix of electronic grooves and chants with a hints of classical and Asian rhythms. It is mostly instrumental, at a lively tempo, with some nice vocals."
5,Great gift!,"I gave this as a present to a girlfriend and she loved it! Nice material, good fit, and great camo design."
1,No longer supported,This game has problems on Windows XP SP2 with DirectX 9.0c. Neither Vivendi Universal Games or MumboJumbo will support this product.
2,Something of Value?,"Bought the set for ""Something of Value."" Too bad the WinstonChurchill prologue, mentioned on the DVD cover, was left off.It was included on the MGM VHS tape. It is also omitted on TCM."
5,Best Actor,"This was an awesome buy, would recommend it to all my friends and relatives. This is a phenomonal deal with the great actor."
1,Technical Problems,"I have no idea how this film is. Although it is labeled a Region 1 DVD Video, I found that it was unplayable on all of my DVD players."
2,Flimsy construction,"Although the item currently gets the job done, it's cheaply made and the stopper wobbles when it's in the ""up"" position.. So the device constantly moves when doing dishes. I have no confidence it will stand up to repeated use."
4,It works!,I read several reviews of this item before purchasing it. The most helpful was the one stating that the customer pressed down on the center of the stopper to make it function correctly; that worked...for the most part. This replacement stopper worked so much better than the hardware replacement stopper we initially purchased.
4,Does the job ....... but,"This does the job, I am always concerned about utensils falling into disposal, and the damage that can cause. This little stopper does the trick. Items stay out, and water and small bits of food can pass through. Can be used as a total stopper, too, when you want to fill sink. Only drawback it the center piece doesn't stay nice and straight like in the photo when you pull it up. Tilts to one side. Wish it stayed nice and straight,t then this would be perfect!!!!!"
3,Too expensive for what it is,"I feel that this item is slightly smaller in diameter than it should be. It stops up the sink well, but doesn't hold water in the sink for very long because it seems like it should be just a bit bigger. It is nice quality, but I think the price for it is a little steep for what you get.I probably would have gone with a generic one (from Walmart or Home Depot) if I had known it would not seal very well.I have an InSinkErator brand Badger 5 disposal and I thought this would fit perfectly for it, but I was disappointed."
5,"InSinkErator STP-SS Sink Stopper, Stainless Steel","I couldn't be happier with this product! It fits perfectly in my InSinkErator Garbage Disposal drain hole. I don't know why some people complain that it doesn't completely seal and stop up their drain. It fits mine like a glove, no leaks or slow draining for me. It looks really nice too, I used to have an ugly off white colored sink stopper that I constantly had to bleach because it would stain, this is perfect! Definitely cheaper to purchase online than at a home improvement store. I recommend anyone who has an InSinkErator to get one of these! It will make your sink look nice and completed. You can get the stopper in a wide variety of finishes too, not just stainless which I think is pretty nice if I decide to get a new sink, like oil rubbed bronze."
5,Works like it should,This is a basic item and it works just like they say it should. Stops the water when needed and has kept its color and shape.
3,"Good, But It Does Leak","This looked so small when I received it (it was replacing a rubber one that went OVER the drain)---this one fits down IN the drain of the InSinkerator and it is the right size for that! Nice looking, I only use it for filling the sink to wash lettuce, and yes the water drained out slowly and the sink was empty when I came back about 15 min later. You have to really push it in hard and seat it well for the water not to leak out slowly. It looks so nice, and it keeps the water in enough to rinse the lettuce so yes I would recommend getting it, especially if you're replacing something stained and ugly. I got the stainless steel color and it really looks sharp!"
5,Great item!,"Great item, works great. Solves my problem of getting a great seal to keep water in the sink. And prevents things from dropping in that shouldn't while allowing water to drain easily."
1,stopper,Brushed stainless steel stopper was dull and looked old worn and lackluster. Just horrible. I used the chrome stopper instead that came with the disposal. Went better with the new brushed stainless steel sink anyway - I was surprised.
5,Getting the real thing!,"The stopper on our 5-year-old sink was fraying at the rubber edge gasket -- something my wife found most annoying, as the water level dropped fairly quickly.i had stopped into Home Depot for a replacement part, which was cheap. Inasmuch as it was inexpensive, but also because it was poorly made and didn't do the job.Having learned my lesson, I went to Amazon. The real stopper was easy to find there (much easier than on the InSinkERator website!) and easy to order. It came quickly and works every bit as well as the original.Yay for Amazon and InSinkErator!"
3,Doesn't fit my drain,"It is a good idea and seems to be well made and sturdy but it doesn't fit my drain. That is, it doesn't stop the water from draining."
5,Great item!,"Prior to purchasing, I read a few other reviews that mentioned the product did not fully stop the sink from leaking. This stopper works fine for me and looks great! It completely stops water from exting the sink basin. Nice looking and a good price."
1,Only 1 Color Has Drain Option,The only reason I bought this was because the picture showed it with the ability to open and allow water to drain without my forks falling through... Apparently ONLY the one color has this option... What a waste! I already have enough drain stoppers!!!
5,Fits the plug.,"A sink stopper of this size has become virtually unprocurable in Australia. This item is wellmade and fits perfectly. my only criticism is that the blurb for it did not include specifications of diameter in inches or mms; without those, purchase requires a guess as to whether it will fit."
3,"Different ""colors"" are not the same model!","Just something to note: the ""polished stainless steel"" stopper is actually a completely different design (and description) than the other finishes. Why they are listed together as color variations on the same product I'm not sure, but keep an eye on which ""finish"" each review is actually for; I suspect even the remaining range of colors may actually be at least slightly different models."
4,Nice product. Durable.,This sink stopper is good for regular three compartment sink in a restaurant. We use this kind of sink stopper for years now. And it is hard to find. I'll buy more later.
3,Not quite what was expected,It works - lower quality construction than anticipated. The underside is hollow and overall seems cheap. A little overpriced in my opinion.
1,leaky stopper,"Paid $170 for new insinkerator disposal and guess what the stopper doesn't stop. It leaks. Manufacturer says oops it isn't to stop water it slows the water. Their advice "" Duh, I don't know."" Outrageous"
3,So So Stopper,"I like the look of this stopper being stainless and I can leave it in the sink, without having to remove it to drain water. Which is the way we use it 90% of the time. So we basically leave it in the sink all the time.We just bought new Quartz counters and stainless steel sinks and this stopper matches well.My only negative on this product, is that when the stopper is open as shown in the picture of the product in Amazon, the center section flops to the side. It doesn't stand up nice and straight like the picture shows. So when opening this stopper the center knob flops to the left, right, whichever way gravity pulls it. It tilts about 10 degrees. It just doesn't seem high quality. It kind of looks like its broken or worn out when viewed in the sink.On the other hand, when it is closed it holds water well with no problems in my sink. I noticed other reviews that had problems holding water, but not in our case."
5,sink stopper,I was worried that this wouldn't fit but apparently all InSinkErators fit? I ordered a new one cause my last one was gross (and who knows how old) This one looks like it wont be able to get as gross since the button inside isn't as small to hold mold and what not.
5,Definitely not Plastic,There is an Old saying you pay for what you get. So far this wire brush has been Great.It is well constructed and not like the plastic toys one can get to buy as pseudo wire brushes.It slipped onto my arbor like a charm ... snug but not to much so. Seems this wire brushwill have a long life.
1,USA? NOT,"DEwalt, a supposed American company. What a joke. I have not tried this yet, but guess where this is made? Fricking Red China. I am so sick of this crap."
3,Okay for a spoon,"There's just no way that anyone should pay the suggested $10 for this item. I got it free when I purchased another Kaiser bakeware item. At that price, it's about worth it. The packaging threw me off because it lists the heat tolerance in Centigrade, i.e., 260 degrees, versus Fahrenheit, which is what I'm more used to. That does translate to 500 degrees F. December 9 update: Okay, this spoon is just perfect for doing scrambled eggs. Based on what others have written about it retaining stains and possibly odors if put in the dishwasher, I've decided to just use it for eggs. However, it's still not worth $10."
3,Its a plastic spoon.,"For the ten dollar price, I expected more. But, this spoon compares to some other $3 to $5 spoons that I could have bought at WalMart, and it is smaller than most of those.I guess it is priced higher because it was made in Germany and not China."
4,odd shaped spoon,I got the spoon free as a promotion. It actually might be usefull! :)I use it for sauces and soups. It is a little long though.
4,This will make a nice gift.,"I bought this to give as a gift. Considering they run $10+, I think free was an excellent deal. Normally I don't like silicone bakeware, as it leaches chemicals into your food when cooked. But since this won't be used in the oven, it should be fine. I may decide to keep this for myself."
1,Lacks something,"I kept trying to get soup into the bowl with it, but the soup just ran right out through the hole. I strongly prefer the ""holeless version."""
4,Great iPod cover that covers the WHOLE iPod,"I chose this cover because I wanted an iPod cover that protected the entire iPod - most don't cover the click wheel. I love this. It fits like a glove and doesn't impede the use of the click wheel. The only thing that might not be perfect is that it has left some purple (mine is purple, not red) marks on my click wheel. I think if I scrubbed it, they'd come off, but it doesn't bother me. I'd rather have that than wear from finger oils - much less attractive. (I looked it up on the Radtech website, and it tells you how to avoid the color transfer.)"
1,GG ROCK - THIS BLEW,No good - GG woulda hated it - Tame - lame - Feeble stuff - Humble Pie - Jimi Hendrix - Buffy rock - Brook
5,"Excellent book, wonderful humor and insight!",Eckhart Tolle mentioned this book in one of his talks and I loved the title. The book itself is fascinating and wise.
5,Another great book by Kornfield,"This is my third Jack Kornfield book and I was very pleased with it. One aspect of a great teacher is their willingness to look from all angles and all traditions as an exercise in humility and open-mindedness. Here Jack Kornfield presents in depth quotes and interviews from people of a variety of spiritual backgrounds bringing together their common humanity and wisdom from across the spiritual universe. I only became more and more pleased with the book as I read and as I felt when I finish the other Jack Kornfield books I've read, I knew I would be again reading this great book one day. If you like Jack Kornfield's work and other books, you will love this book."
2,A little to much other stuff,"I got about halfway through this and put it aside. I thought it was going to be a book about Buddhism and I was extremely disappointed that he would produce something so watered down. For me, he gets into way too much of the philosophies of other religions. I didn't buy it to read a bunch of bible, Torah and Koran verses. I know in the future won't buy anythihing of his unless I've been able to review a good portion of the book first."
3,I liked it,"I thought it was an okay book. Nothing mind blowing, but I would recommend it if you have time. I liked reading about other people's experiences very much, about finding peace and happiness while meditating or on a retreat somewhere. It made me think of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj saying something along the lines of, ""You can spend ten minutes, ten days, or ten years in meditative bliss, but the fact is you always have to come back to daily life, therefore it is useless."" This is obviously true and I found it weird that so many advanced spiritual seekers don't see that. Spiritual practice IS daily life. The laundry is the ecstasy."
3,Poor binding,"The reviews for this book praise the book's written contents, and I would agree with most of what has been said.I would, however, like to provide a review of the book's quality (of this Rider publication): this publication [ISBN 0712606580] has a far lower quality binding than that of Bantam's publication [0553378295 & 0553102907].The spine of this publication creases easily while opening the pages, making it look like a well worn book, even if one tries to handle the book carefully.This will make the Rider book have a far lower resale value."
4,Great insights,"This book helped me to realize that bliss achieved is not all there is, nor does it erase our deep perceptions that stand in the way of our enlightenment. Kornfield makes it very clear that given the right setting we can achieve bliss, but we still have to take responsibiltiy to address our fears, know their roots and be able to release them. Then and only then do we achieve bliss as well as self-realization that together I think then equate to enlightenment. Great illustrative stories that help Kornfield explain to us what we all have to do on a practical level.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
4,like a magazine investigative report.,"Mr. Kornfield's extensive experiences in buddhist meditation and his wide contact with other meditative traditions gave him an unique insight into the core of spiritual life. His explanations of non-Buddhist experiences and writings, however, appeared to be rather subjective. He might have tried too hard to interprete them in a way that supported his theme.Also, his assertion that the experiences of insight do not fundamentally change one's personality somewhat belittles the benefits of meditative efforts.This is a fine book for general reading.For someone who is serious about meditation and the spritual path, Ayya Khema's books, particularly ""Who is my self"", provide more practical, in-depth information."
4,Waking up can have it's bumps and bruises too,I really liked this book because it helped me realize that waking up or trying to wake up has it's setbacks at times. That alot of us have the same difficulties on the path awakening. I loved this book.
3,THE BEST PART OF THIS BOOK IS,"THE TITLE. I READ IT AWHILE AGO AND DON'T RECALL MOST OF IT, HOWEVER, IT DIDN'T LEAVE ME WITH ANYTHING WHEN I FINISHED IT."
5,my favorite,"Absolutely my favorite book. I love how Kornfield weaves together scriptural verse, poetry, prose and his own and others stories to give us clues on ""How the Heart Grows Wise."""
1,Deep Sea Fishing,"SAVE YOUR MONEY! The only good thing about this video is it shows you how to fillet a fish. You can learn that on a party boat. This video lacks ""How to"" if that's what you looking for."
1,Too basic. Not even a good summary of AS/400 manual.,This book is better easy reading with very little insight to the more intricate functions of SQL for the 400. Might be useful if you have never programmed SQL.
1,My Last time purchasing a used item,"The first computer they sent me was scratched up and the bottom housing was loose, needless to say it did not work. However, their customer service was great they immediately sent another computer with extra hard drive space and more Ram space capability. It also plays DVDs. All this is great, but I wanted the CD burner as it was advertised on Amazon.And I was also disappointed each time I turn it on it will not work unless I unplug it and plug it back in. I could have gotten it resolved but was afraid of more disappointment. Needless to say I will purchase no more used and refurbished products unless sold by Amazon."
5,Awesome!,Haven't had any problems & just loved the prompt service!!! Definately will tell friends and family about my purchase since it saved me alot of money and time!
1,What a ripoff,"I received this CPU and hooked it up and after about a minute, I get a MESSAGE saying hard drive not found, F2 to setup, set to auto ok fine reboot same problem. Maybe the hard drive is bad? So I hit best buy, brand new hard drive and guess what? No hard drive found, so now I have another Dell paper weight great. Great so no reply from the company that sold me this hunk of junk. Amazon needs to drop these rip off kings."
1,Read the title,"The Specs of the Machine that is being sold is not the same specs as in the title. I.E. it read 2.6 Ghz, but when you go to the item descript it will read 2.4 ghz. Just double check, don't depend on the the title, of the item from this company. Look closely at the specs..Item works fine, shipped quickly."
1,DAMAGED MERCHANDISE,EBUYCAFE IS NOT PROVIDING SERVICE TO PURCHASE OF DAMAGED EQUIPMENT AND DOES NOT WANT TO MAKE REFUND ALTHOUGH EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN RETURNED.YOU SHOULD INVESTIGATE EBUYCAFE FOR SELLING DAMAGED PRODUCTS IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND THEN REFUSING TO PROVIDE CREDIT.
2,Refurbed Computer Has Problems,"This tower may be a fine computer from the factory, but this refurbed one has some serious issues. A-drive doesn't work. Game card works sporadically. Not worth the money."
2,No words,"Just so other customer are aware; there are no lyrics on this CD. The music is great but if you want lyrics to the songs, this isn't the CD for you."
4,Fun and Lighthearted,"This guide to horse care is full of fun little tidbits to amuse all ages. It's presented with goofy little tricks to keep the viewer amused and interested. It's a little slapped together, but I don't mind the lack of bells and whistles. It's accurate, helpful and fun to watch, so what more could you ask for? Actually, I could ask for the exploration of tack placement and care, as well as more information on the correct way to handle and groom a horse. It would make this video exactly what I'm looking for, which is a fun, educational video to show to kids at a summer horse camp.All in all, this was a great buy and will be an awesome rainy-day activity for any time conscientious horse enthusiast."
4,My life is a Fellini movie!,"The whimsical, emotive music of such favorites as The Nights of Cabiria and La Dolce Vita jumps from this CD--you'll scan your room for bizarre characters shouting in Itallian! Listening to these works brings home the power of music in film, and the lack of such force in today's cinematic scores. Thank you Nino Rota for a taste of music far from the beaten path."
4,Nino! Fellini!,"I guess they don't make 'em like they used to? This disc is a great introduction to the collaborative effort of Federico Fellini & Nino Rota. The music moves from the exuberant, care-free joy of La Dolce Vita, to the sadness of La Strada, to the strangely moving pieces from Satyricon & Roma - well, each track contains all those moments and more. I'd give this thing five stars - if only they'd have selected longer tracks of music from each film! As it stands, some are mere fragments, and sadly understated. But all in all, worth a listen - if you end up seeking out the complete, original soundtracks - it will definitely be worth the trip."
4,A soulless killer and a man searching for his soul,"Barrett Raines has hit bottom--his marriage is falling apart, he's drinking beer for breakfast, and he screws up his partner (the most unforgivable sin for a cop). After months of desk duty in punishment, he's put on a case.Sent to Dead Man's Bay, Barrett must confront prejudice from a small town sheriff (Barett is African American), and a community so closed-mouthed it won't admit to anything. When a cold-blooded killer arrives, Barrett must face into his own soul to determine what really would constitute justice."
3,a bit small in size but tastey,"Tired of not getting the dressing you want? I am!! this works perfect, keep in wallet or office, car, etc. taste good however not enough in one pouch for a normal side salad, let alone a normal size salad"
1,MSG MSG MSG,"I got an MSG reaction off this dressing which I trusted was free from unpleasant unhealthy ingredients. I still have a headache while writing this. After I realized I was reacting to my plate of salad, I looked at the listed ingredients of the only thing on my plate that wasn't a vegetable (this dressing) and sure enough it says 'natural flavoring' or 'natural flavor' (I'm not right where I can see the packaging now) but anyway, this type of label is sneaky industry code for MSG, because people seeking healthy foods won't buy products labeled with MSG."
4,A good book for a person who has never created a web page.,"Dummies 101: Creating Web Pages is a very good book for a person who has never created a web page. The book covers every thing a beginer need to know, From basic HTML to Publishing your web page on the net. Four stars for Kim Komando!"
3,I like it,"overall its OK. there are some really good songs and some duds; It's hard to tell form the previews which are which, though."
2,definitely not a page turner,"First Ryan I've read. Found it dull and thought I would scream if he said ""arguably"" or ""patently"" one more time. The Cindasue dialect could have done without.. found it stupid and corny. Couldn't follow the plot either - guess i'm no mystery buff. Will have to try another Ryan mystery to see if it was just this one that lost my attention. I finished it only because I was on a boat for two days and nothing else aboard."
1,I *WANTED* to love this book!,"I have a shelf full of well-loved and often read Andrew Greeley. The Bishop and the Three Kings will NOT be joining them!The mystery plot line was intriguing and could have been delightful in typical Blackie Ryan style if it had not been derailed early on by the secondary storyline and the Appalachian dialect. I found both the courtship and ""mountain talk"" to be distracting, cumbersome, and worst of all, ""too, too cute"". If this introduces a new and ongoing character, let's hope she'll begin using ""Standard"" English in both her conversations and internal dialog. If so....we might actually care about her rather than hoping the romance doesn't flower so that we won't be subjected to her further!"
3,Bishop and Three Kings,I have read most of the Blackie Ryan mysteries. This one was even more far fechted than the Bishop at Sea
2,not good,"love ugly sticks but not this one... quality is great but it does not cast better than the rod this one replaced... it replaced a lighting rod which has terrible build quality, but cast great.... its a two piece rod with all the guides on the upper half, this is a huge flaw and absolutely terrible..."
5,"Warning-Great Rod, but is NOT 6'2""--it is 5'6""","This is a great rod, but Amazon has the wrong length listed. This is an SP11562L model as stated in the product details... ""Item model number: SP11562Lwhich means it is a spinning rod (SP) 5'6"" length (56) 2 piece (2) light action (L). Great rod and a light reel such as theZebco Omega Z02 Spincast Reelloaded with some 6 lb.Berkley Trilene Professional Grade Fluorocarbon 110 Yd Pony Spoolmakes a great panfish combo."
5,GREAT FOR ANYONE!,"This book is a must for anyone working with rehab, mature, and relatively healthy individuals. I use this book to help target specific areas/muscles where a person may need additional strength or stretching. It is a GREAT reference to keep exercise/exercise therapy fun!"
3,Therapeutic exercises using the foam roller,I expected more from the book. OK for the beginner but not any new information.
4,Beauty hurts but it works,"Me, my husband and my daughter all used this product. We took before and after pictures. Yes, this products works. I could not use it because I didn't like how it made my teeth so sensitive. My husband is addicted to it. His teeth were always sensitive. He says it only (minor) hurts while it's on then the sensitivity goes away. My daughter said the same. It really took years and years of stains off of his teeth. My teeth were already pretty white so I didn't really see a difference in the few times I used it."
5,It really works!,"I tried this before spending $400 for tooth whitening at a location near me (using Rembrandt products). I was very pleased with the results. Hardly a day goes by that someone doesn't ask me how I got such perfect, white teeth. I found both trays in my mouth at the same time a bit uncomfortable, and it made me gag at first, but I soon got used to it. It's certainly a good value for the money."
2,"Save your time, by another product as Amazon's stock seems to have expired.","When Amazon sent this item, it had an expiry date of June 2007. I rang them and said the date was too close and they said they would send another one. I asked if they would make sure that it had a later expiry date, which they said they couldnt do and that if the next one came with a similar expiry date they would simply refund the amount. When the second package came, it had the exact same expiry date ( I don't understand why they didn't take the time to check for one with a later date, it would have saved them money in refunds!) so I can only assume that their stock is old and they havent replaced it. In terms of the actual product the whitening gel seemed ok but as another review mentioned the toothpaste has EXPIRED! it sort of exploded out of the tube when I first opened it and the colour was beige."
3,BPA reports,"This is a great bottle, worked well for my two months old, but as I just discovered, it reportedly, according to several sites, is made of type of plastic that contains BPA, which causes cancer in animal studies.Bottle made with different types of plastic (softer, a bit cloudy type), supposedly don't have this chemical.Bottles madeof platic like this are taken off the market in Canada from what I see and soon will be taken off shelves in some Us stores."
4,Tried 4 other brands and finally like this one,"We tried Avent, Playtex, and Gerber and all had different issues. Finally the Nuk orthodontics were simple, easy to use, not too many parts, and reduced our baby's colic and fussiness. I recall the packaging saying the plastic is BPA Free, so maybe I got a newer edition. But I also am not paranoid like a lot of people. The designs on the outside are scratching off a little, but that's doesn't bother anyone. The feeling, give, and shape of the plastic nipple is very nice - if I were a baby I would like it in my mouth!"
5,Love this bottle!!!!,This bottle was inspired by the German nuk bottle.. My husband and I were stationed in germany and these were the only bottles I could find.. I bought one and my son LOVED it.. This was back in 2007.. Then I had my daughter and I bought her these bottles as well that was in 2009.. Of course the german nuk don't have cute designs or anything but they are top rated and highly recommended in Europe. I had no problem alterating from the boob to the bottle.. Now we are back in the USA and I'm glad to see that they have these amazing bottles.. now I'm pregnant with 3# and he will be using these bottles as well!!!! No doubt about that.. No leaks no tears well Made.. Great thing about them is that they are now BPA free.. So Danke Schon Deutschland for this amazing bottle!!!!
5,Finally a bottle that has slow enough flow for a newborn,"I bought these bottles as a last resort. I had already been through Avent, Playtex Nursers, Soothies, and Evenflo. All of their slow flow nipples were way too fast for my newborn twins. The formula ran right out of their mouths and went everywhere. These nipples are actually slow flow and do not run too fast. I like how easy to clean the wide mouth bottles and wider nipples are. Also, I like the fact that they are standard bottles, no liners to buy and they can be used in my bottle warmer that uses steam, which is much faster than the bottle warmers that do not. I just wish that I had tried them sooner instead of going straight to more expensive ones like Avent."
1,Very Dissapointed!!! Dont Let Cute Designs Fool You!,"Now im a mom of 3, so i know a thing or two about bottles! I purchased these bottles for their cute girly designs, affordable, and breast like appearance. Big Mistake! The hole of the nipple is located on the side! Yes the side! Making it very hard for my daughter to suck out any formula! A feeding of 2 or 3 ounces of formula would take 2-3 hrs! So all day it seemed like i was feeding her. Her Mouth & Tongue would get red from sucking sooo hard! I tried making the holes bigger & even bought Mediam Flow! Nothing Worked! Finally i bought the inexpensive GERBER Bottles because it had always did the job with my other children! Now feedings lasts 15 minutes! and My daughter is satified. She sleeps longer because before she would be up all day & night trying to suck 3 ounces out of each feeding."
2,Don't waste your money,"I have to admit, I bought these because they were cute. Bad Idea. They leaked everywhere, and my son couldn't get anything out of them no matter how long he ate, or how I held the nipple. Also, after a few washings it got a yucky film that wouldn't got away. I threw mine out."
2,Great design but most likely contains BPA. Gerber refuses to change.,Really liked these bottles but found out they potentially contain BPA. Upon calling Gerber they stand behind not removing BPA due to insufficent studies. This was before Canada banned the products. They still ride the hardline and refuse to reproduce these without BPA.The nipples were good and luckily they sell those by themselves so I bought those and used them with Evenflo BPA free bottles.I feel it's better to err on the side of caution and stay away from BPA. Especially since a country banned it..(Canada).
3,:|,"I am only giving this book three stars because I have read Lindsay McKenna's Morgan's Mercenaries series since the beginning. I like the characters, and the beginning books were so good, but they have slacked off since. I am holding out hope that they get better.The one word that I can use to describe this book is Depressing. This beloved couple that we fell in love with in 'Return of a Hero' has been put through the ringer yet again. The horrible things that these characters have had to endure completely overshadows the earlier love story that I remember. I also know that if I had not read the earlier stories I would not have bought this book. Without the earlier stories involving Morgan and his family I do not think that any reader would enjoy this or understand the past of these characters or the company that Morgan put together, Perseus. I have already bought all of the books in this series, so I can only hope that they get better because this one was a huge disappointment."
1,Defective,"Item arrived in original packaging, however upon plugging in my earbuds, it was clear both female connectors were defective based on the lack of a positive ""click"" when plugging in my earbuds. And in fact, only one channel would transmit a signal. Same finding with multiple earbuds and headphones. Am attempting to get a refund."
4,Keeps My Interest,"At first I was skeptical of this program... Lucy Liu as Watson? But it turns out to be good television. If you can suspend your reality and think Holmes in modern day New York and a woman as Watson, I think it will keep your attention."
4,Very good take on Holmes,"A very good modern take on Holmes. I had my reservations about Lucy Liu as Watson, but she does not disappoint."
4,I like mystery,I like a good mystery story and this one hits the spot. It's fast paced and the characters click together.
3,Elementary is Enjoyable,"Elementary is entertaining. I recommend it for the primary reason it is keeping one of literatures great characters alive one hundred and twenty some odd years after he was created. Now that is a viable character; and there aren't that many to begin with. Plus, Sherlock Holmes the character something to teach about observation. The programme itself is Ok in my opinion. Don't expect to be electrified, though those new to the character might be electrified by the mental acuity of Holmes."
3,Good show hopefully gets better,We were able to stay through the entire show however as with a lot of shows there were parts that we both drifted a bit in. We will stay with this one at least two more episodes.
3,A tad insensitive,"Couldn't CBS have played this episode later, not the same week that everyone (practically) in Rockaway Beach lost their houses..."
5,Definately different.,While the premise and universe are slightly different it's a welcome spin on a time honored classic and both the main actors do it justice. Great show for people who like mysteries but are tired of the same ole same ole in procedural drama type mysteries.
5,A Great Series,I think Elementary is a great series. I have enjoyed the good writing with many a good twist to the plot. The acting is also first rate.
5,Brilliant!,"I was suspect that anything could touch the BBC version of Sherlock, but this is easily just as good. Very well done. The plots are even more loosely based on Doyle's stories, but Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are amazing."
4,Virtuous prepare to fast forward,My family is very picky about shows we watch. I love this show except for the increasingly sexually suggestive behavior and scenes. It is fun and intelligent but my husband and I are ready to fast forward through the suggestive scenes. We had to skip probably 10 minutes of the show to shield our eyes and get back to the real story line. I like it but be ready to fast forward if you do not want to let yourself commit adultry in your heart.
5,An enjoyable NY adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes story.,"Having finished ten episodes so far, I find the portrayal of Holmes and Watson to be very well done and the writing to be great. Fans of Monk will enjoy this series."
4,Elementary,"I have to say I like the BBC Sherlock better, but I like the interaction between the characters in this show. And I got used to Watson being a girl more easily than I anticipated."
4,Not so elementary,Well crafted - absorbing on many levels - I would very much recommend this - I hope this will the beginning of many seasons
5,Great show on it's own merits,"Some people complain this is no BBC Sherlock- and they are correct- it is completely different take (sans the modern day aspect) -and while it could be considered weaker in comparison to it's BBC cousin (after all each BBC episode is for all intents a feature) , if taken on it's own merits, it is a great show, giving us an interesting look at a familiar character, without taking away the thing that made him interesting in the first place. I enjoy the differences that are brought in by Watson being a female, and really appreciate the fact that we have a promise from the producers that romance will never play into Holmes and Watson's relationship. Great show, takes the procedural formula up quite a few notches in my opinion."
3,No closed captioning,"I would have given this TV series a 5 if there was closed captioning to go with it. I am hard of hearing and couldn't understand most of what was said. But I love Sherlock type series and I'm sure I would love this one. PLEASE Amazon, add closed captioning for those of us who are hard of hearing on deaf!"
4,Easy Access,"After watching for the 1st time, speed on my computer went dimmed. But I like the fact I dont have to miss a show I like again"
5,Great Crime Drama.,Great new Sherlock show. Huge fan of Sherlock Holmes and he is played brilliantly here. Cases are interesting. Can't wait to see how other major characters of the series are portrayed.
4,Smart,"I enjoy series' like this which indicate thought and information, intelligent discourse, and don't rely on slow, obvious spoon-feeding of plot or personality. Sure, the personalities at work here can be a little extreme, but are at least thought-provoking, and so far not annoyingly soap-opera-y in using absurd, standard emotional manipulation as plot mechanisms."
4,Season is growing on me,"Pace and story is building momentum as the season progresses. Liking it more and more. Missing a star because I believe the Sherlock series on BBC is the yardstick all modern interpretations of Arthur Conan Doyle's tales are measured by--which may not be fair since Sherlock plays out in a feature length format [90+ min/episode], rather than Elementary's compressed network serial [50min]. Female Watson is a great twist--and improvement!!!"
4,Quirkiness,"I am enjoying this series, seriously. Both characters' have just enough Quirkiness about them to blend together well. Both have brillient, but flawed past lives to be interesting storylines. I am looking forward to more episodes of ""Elementary""."
2,"If you want modern-day Holmes, settle only for ""Sherlock""","I don't why we in the US do not want to watch the original shows! The BBC' ""Sherlock"", though only having 3 90-minute episodes per season is fantastically well written, and a true pleasure. After watching both seasons of it, I tried to feed my Sherlock need and moved on to ""Elementary."" I will not waste any more of my time."
5,Most excellent,"I had my doubts when the word came out that this show would have a woman playing Watson. Well, the whole thing is brilliant! I have a gig every Thursday night now, so I purchase each episode here on Amazon for streaming. It's a couple bucks a week but so what -- It's Sherlock Holmes!Glad to see such a rekindling of interest in Sherlock & Watson: Robert Downey's movies (2nd one was pretty much a bore, though), the BBC series, Hugh Ashton's Deed Box stories, and now this show.Can't get enough Sherlock!Uke Jackson"
5,It's elementary,"A well written, well acted show! I would recommend it to anyone who has even a passing interest in crime procedurals. But what I like best about this show is the relationships between the characters."
5,Fantastic,"We really enjoyed this show! Great acting and plot, true to the spirit of Sherlock Holmes. If you are a Holmes fan give it a try."
4,Pretty Good!,"Very happy with the 2 stars of the show and the under-stated Aidan Quinn. Great new take on Sherlock and Watson, and it's possible to imagine chemistry between them, even though that doesn't seem to be the focus this season (much). Love Sherlock's thinking process and Watson's penetrating intelligence. I subtracted a star for the apparent lack of effort at choosing and writing for guest stars and supporting cast... that's occasionally enough of a disappointment to bring down a whole episode (especially the episode about the Russian spies -- the daughter). To me there's a big gap in quality between the acting of and writing for the main characters, and the acting of and writing for the rest of the cast (including the other detective, whose name I can't remember). But overall it's satisfying and smart."
3,I like Joan,"After Reading Laurie King""s ""the Beekeeper's Apprentice"" series, it was fun to have the Sherlock movie series and the British TV series. This set of shows I missed. Seeing the pilot only so far, I like Joan Watson very much and the new Sherlock in this one will have to grow on me."
5,Elementary,I wasn't sure how I would like this show but it has become one of my favorite. I look forward to the witty commentary each week.
2,Should be called schlock instead,"This drivel has set the performing arts back to just after the discovery of ""fire make shadow on cave wall"".One would have to have some pretty amazing powers of imagination to conjure up anything in this series thatcould be compared to a Sherlock Holmes mystery. This is about as entertaining as prefabbed particle board andnot nearly as tasty."
5,Great Show,This is a great show. I really enjoy the acting and stories. I cannot wait for them to bring in the big baddie. It'll be interesting when they hit that point in the show.
5,Elementary #1,Different than other renditions of Sherlock Holmes but captures the near psychotic nature of the character. Very good will be watching more.
4,Well Done,"Well done series based on the many, many Sherlock Holmes resurrection variants which have been done over the years, both written and on screen."
4,Better with time,"I didn't like the beginning of this series being a Holmes aficionado, but its growing on me. The Holmes character is filling out nicely and the stories are getting better. I would like to see a bit more depth and complication to the mysteries though. Holmes is getting off easy."
5,terrific show,"Well acted, very good pairing of Lucy Liu and Johnny lee miller. The story Lines are feel fresh - considering how many detective shows ate out there."
5,One of the Best Series Ever!,"Only because we are such Sherlock Holmes fans did we even turn on this series, mainly to make fun of it. Now it is the most anticipated TV show each week in our house. Wonderful, inventive, creative. Excellent Series."
4,good but not the best ep,There are better episodes of this show. Don't start with this one. a a a a a a a a
4,Thoroughly entertaining!,Great new show. Being a Sherlock Holmes fan I didn't think I would like an Americanized version but I found it engaging and well worth watching. Now I am hooked!
1,A horrid adaption,"This American attempt to update the Sherlock Holmes series might appeal to those who have never read the books or seen any of the BBC adaptions of them. I am not adverse to trying to update the series but this is whiny rather than witty, crass instead of clever, substituting P.C. platitudes for plots with finesse. Unlike the BBC re-imagining in Sherlock, which pays homage to the original and then spins the storyline in a whole new updated direction, this bears no resemblance, other than the names, to the original. NOT WORTH THE TIME. Buy the BBC series instead and see what it could have been."
2,video control window frame wouldn't close,"video control window frame wouldn't close.Quality was great. Everything was great. Were it not for this user-interface flaw, I'd give it five stars.Love Amazon! Sorry. Thanks,-Al Porter"
1,Really? 'Sherlock' in name only...,"I'm really surprised how many people seem to like this show! It's just another dumbed down mystery show. I'm also quite surprised how many reviewers said they were Sherlock Holmes fans, since this show has NOTHING to do with A.C. Doyles Sherlock Holmes except the blatant ripoff of the name! Doyle is never even mentioned in the credits for Petes sake! I've only watched 2 episodes, and that's about 1 too many; the 'mysteries' are trite, the 'solves' are ridiculously simplistic and unimaginative, and the acting is 'meh' at best. Comparing this to the true-to-literature, but modern era, 'SHERLOCK' starring Benedict Cumberbatch is like comparing Van Gogh to Kincaid! I watched this because I love the Holmes stories and I thought it might have potential, but without any connection whatsoever to those timeless stories, it's just another crappy show."
1,If you have an IQ over 95...,"Mundane, pedestrian, intellectually insulting. These are all things that Elementary wishes it could rise to the level of. It is too clearly gimmicky to be effectively a gimmick. A disappointment on every level and an insult to any actual Holmes fans. This so far removed from the greatness of the BBC series Sherlock that I don't think it deserves to inhabit the same universe. The rest of the world must watch elementary and think it was intended for mentally challenged pre-schoolers. If your IQ is below 95, this program no doubt keeps you guessing, but then so would Sesame Street. If you like watching Lucy Liu disprove that Asian women are ageless in appearance, tune in. If you want to be entertained, buy paint...watch it dry."
1,Nope!,"I refuse to watch it. Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch are the only Sherlock/Watson duo I want to see. The dialog and chemistry between them and the rest of the characters is so well crafted. I just could never get past Watson being a woman or Lucy Liu. Isn't there some slow motion leather clad gunfight she is missing. Really cbs? You couldn't come up with an original show? Thought maybe you could knock-off another brilliant British TV show and no one would notice. I bet you thought you'd be clever too, but you're just sad. Leave being innovative to actual innovators and go back to turning out more tripe for the average TV viewers. You know the drill set up, one liner, canned laughter and repeat.I think that piece of crap is called ""Two and a Half Men"" Don't forget the shows about ""Reality"". Yes, because I do love watching people take naps and play water basketball, after a day of actually working for money to simply get by. /rantoff"
4,Entertaining,This version of Sherlock Holmes is entertaining. Plots are more about the relationship between Sherlock and Watson but still provide the element of mystery.
5,It's pretty good,"Sherlock's accent is great. I wonder if it's native. Anyway, the plot is pretty good. It's not as good, of course, as the movie, but it's better than the reality shows and the other dectective shows out right now. Lucy is a little disappointing; I wanted her to be Sherlock. But, oh well. I like the show so far and I have watched 5 episodes. I wish they made a few more episodes, but I will have to wait until February for season 2."
5,Intriguing show,I was pleasantly surprised by this show. I really like the actors and their takes on Holmes and Watson. I'm looking forward to more episodes.
4,NOT BAD,"I this is a good series, but the BBC version of Sherlock is much, much better written. If you like mystery type TV shows - it's not bad."
1,quality?,"there are no subtitles, at least codnt find itand it is really crappy quality of video and video player."
3,It was OK,"Keeping in mind that this was the pilot episode; I will say that I only found it to be OK. I am hoping that as I watch two or three more episodes I will like it more. But right now it doesn't hold a candle to ""Sherlock"" in my book."
5,Intellectual Entertainment,It is nice to watch a TV program that actually makes you use your brain! The two main characters play well off of each other and each week has a fresh take on puzzle solving.
5,A series fit for the Strand,What television can and should be. Watson and Holmes in the 21st century. I am so looking forward to the second season of Elementary.
3,New Series,"The beginning really put me off, but I decided to keep watching and I'm glad I did. The one after the pilot is even better. I do hope this series makes it."
5,Each episode is a little gem!,"Excellent, pitch-perfect, far-fetched plots with superb musical accompaniment. Rich set designs. Witty dialogue. First-class acting. Mermerizing performances by the main characters -- especially Sherlock."
4,Like the twist with Lucy Liu as Dr. Watson...,Like the contemporary adaptation with Lucy Liu as Dr. Watson. Interesting tension between Holmes and Watson that never would come up with male Dr. Watson.
2,Elementary jumps the shark in the first season,"I love the Sherlock Holmes canon and have enjoyed Elementary so far, but the show jumps the shark in this episode. A dead hotel manager ends up in a washing machine. She turns out to be a spy, along with her husband and a friend who runs a landmine non-profit. Her daughter, a seventeen year old soccer player and recovering pain pill addict, gets caught up in the mess. It's a disaster of a turn for Elementary--too much packed into 45 minutes, too glibly."
3,"Too violent, not enough wit....","I enjoyed some of the episodes and had high hopes, but the shows were increasingly violent without the humor, wit, clever plot twists or character development that I was looking for. Although I assume a crime drama will have some gore, they took it too far in the last several shows I watched."
4,Really like this.,"I always liked the original Sherlock Holmes stories, and this adds some fascinating twists to them. It's a great show."
4,average show,"Although there is good chemistry between Sherlock and Joan Watson, the show can be hard to follow. Sherlock speaks too fast at times and has a mumbling British accent. The plots are interesting, but there is no depth in the lives of the other characters.However I plan to watch it next season because I have some hope for the show."
4,Very innovative. Actors are top-notch.,"This series is an innovative take on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson--and has some surprising story lines. My only complaint is that some of the weeks, I do think the subject matter got too gruesome."
4,catch the new groove...,"Luke Slater turns out a gritty edged ,bass infested electronica album, flirting with the industrial sound by driving a slamming beat that will get a dead nun dancing. Interspersed with digitally altered voices and looping sound effects, Luke has created a killer with this one. I defy you to sit still while listening to it. Hard and heavy style. Enjoy!"
4,Fresh Slater turns to hip-hop beats,"Luke Slater, once a real techno warrior, delivers with Wireless fine piece of hip-hop-influenced tracks. Electro and big beat are also keywords here - but not in commercial sense. Music is about the change and with Luke's newst you can perceive it."
2,A stumble from his previous Freek Funk,"Wow, what happened here. Seriously. Slater's the artist who dropped Freek Funk back in '97, one of the sharper albums of the year and a meaty ride through funk-fueled techno. Wireless instead culls strong influences from electro and breakbeat, and a dose of odd effects for good measure; that's all well and good, unless your breaks sound instantly dated (""Sheer Five Five"" plays like an 80's rap track) and the intricate rhythms take a step backward.The bigger surprise lies in the two big club successes, mixes of ""Body Freefall"" and ""All Exhale,"" were heavily pushed by DJ's, and it's safe to say serious reworking went on to make them into hits. ""Freefall"" in particular lies just this side of techno gabba.Not that there aren't cuts included here that show Luke Slater knows how to work the equipment; whether you have the patience to wade through to find them is another matter."
5,Had my interest after first page.,"Its an actual account of a raid to free POWs carried out during the Vietnam war. It has accurate info from top-to-bottom, the account of the mission from conception to execution and even following through to the political aftermath.Probably the best military history book ever in print.My wifes uncle was one of the helicopter pilots who lived to tell us about it, way before the book was published. He said it was a great mission by joint forces, even though no POW's were rescued."
5,Book from Amazon,"Received the book well in advance of the stated date. I will use this dealer again, excellent services by them."
2,I do not recomend this mouse,"When my screen saver comes on I have to hit the very small connect button on the receiver and on the bottom of the mouse, or the mouse does not work. It is very small and not ergonomic. You have to be within 2 1/2 feet of the receiver in order for it to work.On the upside, when it does work, it is perfect."
3,convient but sometimes a hassle,When i bount this mouse i was surprised at how the batteries chargede through the USB port in your computer. i did like the troubleshoot option for the mouse's signal and how it would sleep when not in use or teh on/off switch but it barely work two feet from the computer and the rechargeable batteries last a week but also charge up quickly. It was basicly balanced pros/cons
1,Junk,This is the worst mouse ever. Don't buy it. It has the biggest receiver I have ever seen. I got this through Buy.com and they won't take it back. It was $10 and a rip off at any price.
3,I thought EMI would've mixed these into first-time stereo...NO WAY,"Along with the first Procol Harum LP, these 1967 Donovan recordings are the last mono or rechanneled albums issued. Three tracks from this and the Mellow Yellow original LPs (Sunshine Superman, Season Of The Witch and Sunny South Kensington) have been mixed into stereo. Strangely, only Sunshine Superman is in stereo here....the other two are mono!I'm very disappointed that they did NOT remixe Writer In The Sun, San And Foam, The Observation, Bleak City Woman, House Of Jansch, Young Girl Blues, Museum, or Hampstead Incident into stereo.To my ears, these tracks sound no better than the US Epic original CDs."
3,Donovan - Mellow Yellow,This LP is great if you can find it in good condition. The one I got is marginal conditions and will work until I find a better copy.
4,Golders Green,"Had heard of the album as a teen, back in the 1960s.Never listened to it until now.The headline Mellow Yellow-an indoctrinal pop single, recieved airplay everywhere. The album as a whole is a compilation of lightly phrased if ornate jazz structures. Very refreshing, creative. Somebody was actually thinking back then.There is a second set of recordings of some songs,less ornate,like sketches.Either way,refreshing artistic achievement lives on today."
4,Worth the money!,For the money you can't do better than this if you collect Blue Ridge Pottery. Although there are many patterns of Blue Ridge dinnerware not pictured the majority of the most collectible patterns are. The color photos are great and the history of the company is very informative. I have been able to identify more than 90% of the Blue Ridge dinnerware I have picked up at flea markets and estate sales with this book.
2,Too Round for aviators,"Hey guys, this product is...well... a cheap pair of sunglasses. I'm not sure why they even call them aviators, they look nothing like military style aviators or the ray-ban topgun style aviators. In short, these are not, they're just cheap sunglasses."
1,Not happy,What I received was not what was pictured at all. What I got looks like regular aviators. They weren't even the color I ordered. Arrived quickly though. The only plus about the whole situation thus far.
4,GOOD READ!,"This is a very good study on ageing and how to stop or reverse it, but I'm giving it only 4 stars because it's a bit outdated by now. Much interesting research has been done in the years since it was published. I love Keeton's style, as she talks about her childhood in South Africa and her life in London, etc.The text is always very engaging as she discusses the various theories and on-going research. To supplement this book, I recommend William Regelson's ""The Superhormone Promise"" and ""Stopping The Clock"" by Klatz. In conclusion, I suggest that it's time for Kathy to update and bring out a second edition."
2,"Great Book, Bad Description","Saxon Math products are wonderful; be aware that if you order this particular book from this seller, it is indeed that, ONE BOOK! The tests and workbook are not included; this is only the Teacher's Guide."
3,Only the teacher's book,"This textbook is of little value without the tests and worksheets book and the answers book. The complete kit should include the 3 items I mentioned above. The Amazon offering is also overpriced.Having 2 kids, I order the complete kit from an education bookseller and an extra textbook from one of the alternative sellers supported by Amazon. It's interesting how the education booksellers would only sell you the complete kit while Amazon and its partners only provide the separate books but not the bundle."
1,Fear vs. principle,"Why are people afraid of ""choice, ownership, and inheritability"" (as the Cato Institute's ad campaign puts it)? Social Security benefits are not in any way guaranteed under the current system. You can pay your whole adult life into the system expecting to retire at a certain date only to have Congress change at its discretion the terms and benefits of the program! But don't believe me: Read the opinion of the Supreme Court case Flemming v. Nestor (1960) for yourself. Also, consider the findings of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security, the members of which were evenly split between Democrats and Republicans and co-chaired by Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY). Their report is a nonpartisan look at the current state of Social Security--considerably more fair in its conclusions and recommendations, and assessment of the problem, than this partisan defense of a bloated and archaic Ponzi scheme."
3,Federal Employees DO PAY Social Security,"I just wanted to correct the assertions made by the first reviewer Krecke. As a Federal employee I know first hand that we do pay social security taxes at the same rate as private sector employees. There is no ""opt out"" option avialable. Until about 1983 under the Civil Service Retirement System Federal workers did not pay social security taxes but they could not collect social security or take advantage of any of its benefits upon retirement. Instead Fed workers paid a larger of their incomes towards pensions. The new system FERS (Federal Employee Retirement system) implement after 1983 requires fed workers to pay Social Security tax just as everyone else does so we will be effected by any changes to SS as everyone else. There are a lot of misconceptions about federal employees so I would suggest Krecke check the facts before making broad assertions."
1,Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,"I was very disappointed in this book and felt that many of the treatment techniques and ideas presented in the book/model were simply common sense for professionals such as myself who have been treating families for several years. Perhaps it would be more beneficial for those counselors who are just out of school or new to the field. Even more surprising were some of the interventions outlined in the book that I quite frankly felt could do more harm than good to the adolescent and the family and even bordered on abusive. As a clinician, I try to keep an open mind but strongly disagree with some of the author's approaches and hope parents who purchase the book seek the assistance of a professional therapist if they attempt these potentially harmful interventions on their own."
1,Looks are decieving,I bought this for my bathroom and from the picture it looked really good. But when I recieved the product I was so disapointed that I ended throwing it away. Its material is so poorly made that even assembeling was hard. The doors at the top are made of card board.
5,Perfect for the space,This space saver replaced another that had sat there for years in a very small bathroom. This fit much better than the first. We like the way it is arranged. The first cabinet had spring loaded legs that fastened to the ceiling. This one we had to fasten to the wall to keep it sturdy but that was no problem.
2,Very cheap and flimsy,"I bought this to be able to store some of our laundry items (dryer sheets, trash bags, etc.). While it will do the job, which is all I really needed, this product is VERY flimsy and cheaply built. The plastic is so thin, it feels as though it could snap as you are putting it together.For now, we shall see how long it will last holding a few small jugs of laundry soap."
1,Garbage!,"""Rich Dad's Prophecy"" predicts a market crash around 2016 when the oldest Baby Boomers start cashing out their 401(k) plans and stop contributing. Solution: Invest in real estate rental properties instead. (Comment: The market crash came 8 years early, and occured for different reasons. Rental properties have also crashed.)Kiyosaki, however, ignores the difficulty of finding positive cash-flow rental properties (doing so almost forces one to use dangerous ARMs, interest-only loans), evaluating potential purchases for hidden problems (eg. leaky roofs), and cost-effective maintenance of properties. I also don't think much of his characterization of one's home as a liability instead of an asset - it appreciated (until recently). Finally, his book is highly repetitive and becomes boring.Bottom Line: I didn't take Kiyosaki's advice earlier, and am glad I didn't."
2,Too much Sales pitch not enough content,This book is essentially a sales pitch for other Rich dad products. All the concepts are repeated several times and there isn't much depth in the solutions section (except to buy more books/products)
2,Interesting...,"It is amusing to note that the release date of this book was on the 9th, however, the previous comments were placed on the 6th, well ahead of the 9th. I wonder who it was who wrote it? One of Kiyosaki's close friends, or even Robert himself? I feel sorry for all the people who rely on Robert's so called wisdom in the stock markets and for investing. He really has no clue. Keep up the scamming Robert, whats next?"
2,Same Old Stuff Here's My Advice,"You have a better chance as an individual investor if you learn how to play casino games with an advantage. This can be done in blackjack, read Beat the Dealer, or craps, read Forever Craps. With a one to three percent edge, in the long run, you have a better chance in the casinos than in the markets. That's my honest opinion!"
2,Boring book---but you still needs to buy!!!,"I have read all of the RK's books, I can totally with what he said and he has changed my thinking. At least, now I know what I needs to do in my future.But this one is quite boring as he just repeat what he said in his other books. May be it is thw way we can learn something. I still think you need to buy this book is because, it has some steps to suggest you to follow and some new idea. For example, China is going to be largest country in economy very soon. I totally agree with this point.so........buy this book."
4,No Issues Good Product,"Book was delivered quickly. No issues with product or delivery. Be more conscious of condition description, I would have rated it fair/good. Thank you! I will be ordering from you in the future."
5,Awesome !!!,"A muz read for all who wants to know the economic situation of the future and gaining more financial knowlege . There's a chapter on the perfect storm which is juz awesome . About the aging population , China becoming the next economic power .....and how to build your ark to prepare and gain for your financial future ... All the Way !! Robert Kiyosaki !"
2,Huh?,"Hello,If you are all saying he is so right, then are you all moving to China? He preaches what a lousy place the USA might be in 15 to 30 years. Are all of you quitting your jobs and starting to buy houses you won't live in that give you money. And starting businesses that you sell later for a profit. Even if you know what he says, and he's right, 95% of the USA will still get squashed. I think I'm missing something here. Why is this a good thing?Matt"
5,Prophecy: Timely and Scary for Majority of Baby Boomers,"I did not expect to get much out of this book. I expected the usual litany of admonitions and suggestions available in hundreds of articles and basic books on finance for the masses. Despite that low expectation, the first chapter had me hooked.With an aging population, turmoil in the stock markets, and lack of knowledge about how much money is needed for retirement, author Robert Kiyosaki gives specifics to support his theory about predictable problems facing those who hope to retire.The book won't appeal to people who are satisfied with their current job and have no plans to change in the future. But for those who care about government policy and how these policies and demographics are impacting our society, the book is eye-opening as well as easy-to read.The ""rich dad, poor dad"" vehicle gets old but is stiff an effective and sometimes entertaining vehicle for conveying information."
2,The same point reiterated over and over.,"A much better and concise book on this topic is called ""The Great Bust Ahead"". Authored by Daniel Arnold, it provides much more statistical data for an up-coming crash / depression.It's not the 70.5 year olds withdrawing from their 401k's which will cause a crash, it's the 49-54 year old spending age bracket which are heading into retirement.Arnold is predicting a much earlier crash to occur around 2010. I highly recommend his book. It's a short read and will only take about an hour; but is well worth it."
1,Another part of the Rich Dad get rich quick series....,"That is, making himself richer. I would not recommend buying this book if you already know the Rich Dad concept. From the title of the book I thought the book was about how to profit from a falling market such as shorting stocks. Instead this book tells you that you must be rich enough from real estate, businesses, and paper assets so you do not care if the market falls or not. Duh."
4,Prophecy continues to be fulfilled,"Time has proven Robert Kiyosaki to be accurate for the most part. His experience in the marketplace shows through as he explains his opinions, and advice."
3,You should have read this book before the stock market crash...,As a South African disconnected from the USA and UK economies I'm glad I read RDPD Prophecy long before the crash and I paid off most of my investment property's bonds. The info from Prophecy definitely helped me being more viable through these testing times. I now have the cash flow to survive with assets bonded at a mere 5%.
1,He's at it again.,This salesman has been discredited by those who actually know something about investing and wealth creation. I feel sorry for his followers. By all means take your eyes off the smoke and mirrors and look behind the curtain at the very small man standing there. No one quote a specific statement from any of his books to illustrate Kiyosaki points because he doesn't have any. What RTK fans can do is give you THEIR OPINION of what they think he means. There are other better books with good information in them. Good luck to those that think this guy knows the answers.
5,Prophecy,"This book was written with you in mind. Your savings, your invesments and your financial future depend from your financial knowledge. This book tells you how protect your own money from the financial scams out there. Be smart, be creative reading financial books like this. If you want to protect your financial future this is the book, otherwise follow the Wall Street system for the rest of your life."
5,THIS IS NEED TO KNOW INFO,"Robert has done it again and opened my eyes to see the big picture of wealth and what the rich know that others do not.This book tells why we can NOT rely on our government to take care of us financially especially when it comes to social security, our 401k's, and IRA Investments. We think our 401k's and IRA money will be there when we retire because we invested it ourselves. After reading this book, you'll find out that is not the case.I score this book a five. This is need to know information."
2,Very little new and a LOT of the old,"The book has a glimmer of new information. I do believe Mr. Kiyosaki is correct, there will be a boom and then a great crash in the market in the near future. The book is a warning to the Baby Boomer's generation. The message is: Wake up and smell the coffee and take care of your own finances before it's too late. That, in a nutshell, is the only new info in this book.The rest of the book is a re-hash of Mr. Kiyosaki's first series of books. This book has the same ""vagueness"" as his other books. It tells you to become an investor without telling you what to look for in a good investment. It tells you to buy real estate without giving you a clue on how to search for a good piece of property. Then there is the sales pitch for the over priced Cash Quadrant game...Please save your money."
2,Skip it,"There will be a stock market crash in 2016 because this will be when the Baby Boomers start retiring. The Boomers are the first generation to retire with IRAs and 401(k) plans instead of pensions. That means that there will be more people selling stock than buying. This will cause the stock market to crash.There you have it. That's the extent of the Prophecy. The rest of the book is conversations he had with his rich dad and his rich dad's son, some examples of his real estate ventures, and some of the lessons he learned in the Merchant Marine Academy.If you are a Kiyosaki fan, you may get something out of it, but if you are looking for insight on investing for the next decade, skip this book and read Schiff'sCrash Proof 2.0: How to Profit From the Economic Collapseand Turk'sThe Collapse of the Dollar and How to Profit from It: Make a Fortune by Investing in Gold and Other Hard Assets"
2,meh,"All of Kiyosakis books should be read for entertainment purposes only. The messages in his books are used to sell his products. This guy is not a great forecaster, just a great salesman."
1,Save,"... your money!! There is not much here.He made his money through starting his own business, and succeeding. Great, but I'm not at all sure that he gives any real insights that would help anyone else do the same. Plenty of rambling, not much substance.Disappointing."
2,"Oooh, I'm so scared!!","First of all, the book is predicated on being able to predict the stock market 13 years from now. This is clearly impossible, and there are almost an infinite number of things that could happen to screw up the authors predictions.Second, if there really is a huge crash in stocks, real estate values will likely drop considerably. The economy as a whole will fall, rents will drop, and small businesses, which in the best of times, fail at a rate of about 95%, will go out of business in droves.So the advice to get ready for the stock market crash by opening a small business and buying rental real estate makes no sense.So, this book really has very little to offer from a practical sense."
4,A little light on advice,"Kiyosaki does a great job explaining the decline to come. Par for the course, the author is less than clear with his advice. If you have not read ""The Second Great Depression"" or other books like it I do highly recommend this volume. However, your money may be better spent on a more technical manual on how to profit during a declining market."
2,From a Rich Dad Fan,"I have all of Kiyosaki's books and this is actually the most disappointing. He predicts a depression based on lose information that the middle class is over-investing in mutual funds but regularly argues that they are under-investing or not investing in the funds at all. You can't have it both ways. Alongside contradictory argumentation Kiyosaki repeats himself to distraction and at times gives up on the topic of the book to promote Rich Dad products. There is some good information here for sure, but it could have been printed in a pamphlet."
2,The Response of an Irritated Retiree,"This is a coy book, always beating around the bush and promising more than it gives. The several admittedly useful points are buried in massive repetition and emotional narrative and other fluff. The author seems to be using this book to sell his other books which presumably will develop his advice more substantively. Why would it be necessary for a skillful investor to stoop this low to make money selling books?"
2,Don't waste your time,"Please don't waste your time. Although Mr. Kiyosaki has some good advice, he has a one track mind. I can tell he had no schooling by the way the book is written. It sounds like it was written by an eighth grader. He also repeats himself so many times. This is really boring reading and he has no real practical advice ""in case"" you aren't successful."
2,A Kiyosaki Fan,"I am a fan of Kiyosaki, but this book is mostly a waste of time.He could have condensed the whole value of the book into one chapter of Retire Young, Retire Rich. Somebody stop him before he kills the golden goose! Promoting his other endeavours is fine, but at this point, someone in his organization should write a Best Of Kiyosaki, and get his best ideas down to 300 pages."
3,Thought provoking,"My son got me this book for X-mas. I found it hard to lay it down once I started. I have read Rich Dad Poor Dad and part of the Quadrant book. While I have enjoyed all the books to date and was moved to buy Cashflow 101 and 102. (101 have enjoyed very much and view as a good educational game) My son and I have discussed Kiyosaki's writing in detail, there is something missing something doesn't feel right! Why does he never layout detailed plans for his ideas? Who is the the Rich Dad?While I can relate some real life experience with Robert, I still am worried that he is just another in many ... running around fooling all of us working hard middle class people."
3,Good Information but much longer than it needs to be,"Just like all the Rich Dad books I have read, the author goes back over the statements and theories multiple times. Perhaps I am one who likes to ""get to the point"", but it seemed the amount of background the author put in the book and the constant going ""back"" to previous points was quite unnecessary. This book could have been 1/2 as long and actually been much better. This is the last Rich Dad book I will buy."
2,"Strong introduction , then a lot of Advertising .......","This book could be summarized in five pages max . Although ,the beginning is captivating , the remainder is a clear advertising for the remaining books of the series . However , this was good marketing because i am planning to buy Rich Dad poor Dad which talks about an introduction to accounting ; although from a non conventional approach ."
1,"Condescending, Redundant, Repetitive","Robert Kiyosaki's books are all the same thing re-packaged over and over again. This book could have been condensed into a couple of paragraphs and saved it's readers a lot of time. He writes in an arrogant, condescending manner that is hard to stomach. I would hate to have been his real dad. It's obvious that he despises him and worships at the alter of ""Rich Dad."" It's offensive and disturbing.Read the first review of this book and you'll have the essence of the whole thing. Don't give this guy any more money for putting out this drivel."
5,Lovely,I'm interested in our past. I can escape in a book like this one because I can some how relate to the story. I loved it.
2,"Interesting, but I will not buy this book.","I am a Japanese. This book is interesting, but many of slang written in this book are out of date. Most of those slang was used by oldfashioned yakuza or criminals in 20th century. Most of ordinary people in Japan don't speak like that. If you go to Japan, then talk to Japanese like this, people will be astonished, then they will recommend you not to use those words ""for your own good"".Okashina nihongo wo oboetemo shikata arimasen. Watashi ha minasan ni tadashii nihongo wo oboete hoshii desu. Onegaishimasu!!!"
2,Weak,"I am a huge Luka Bloom fan. I would rate ALL of his other works as must haves (if you need to choose just one get Riverside). This album just does not have the power and intensity of his previous works. That being said, if you ever get a chance to see him live don't miss it! You will be blown away."
5,Saw Luka last night...,"...at the Barns at Wolf Trap near Reston VA. A good friend turned me on to LB, and I got this CD at the show. Played it all the way home and have got it on the computer here at work...I'll have to give it a more thorough listening to give more than a first blush review, but it's as good as what I heard last night and more. Easily merits the 5 stars and kudos to my good bud Craig for getting the tix. Excellent live show, by the way...make a point of seeing him in your area."
5,Gastrex,I am using Gastrex to help heal my stomach. I get heartburn from a lot of different types of foods. The anti-acids just cover the problem. Gastrex not only coats my stomach but helps it heal faster.
5,Who can resist The Saint?,"Roger Moore is at his finest in this series. His true personality shines with zinging one-liners, and of course, what red- or blue-blooded female can resist his amazing good looks!But seriously, these stories are set in the top globe-trotting sites on the planet in the 1960's, which brings back such retro nostalgia. The scenery and colors, the camera angles, have those new(at the time) 60's camera angles, some reminiscent of the American series ""Batman"". The stories themselves are very well-written and the adaptations for television are first-rate.If, like me, you're sick and tired of television programmes today which offer a buffet of violence and sex, with nothing left to the imagination, then I urge you to buy this dvd set and enjoy television from a time when good manners were included, ladies wore hats and gloves to go out and about, and the cars were tres cool."
5,Do not miss these shoes - Grab them,"While placing the order i was not sure that how these shoes will actually look like or whether they will be comfortable enough. But after receiveing them, i am fully satisfied with the product and has increased my faith in Adidas brand. These are vry good shoes for trekking or outing purpose.GO GRAB THEM!!!"
5,not only most detailed,"This first instalment in Remini's biography is not only the most detailed accout I have read, it is also the most human. Most biographers of Jackson paint him as simply the first super-patriot in american history. After reading this and it's companion volumes one sees just how much Jackson changed this contry that we all love so. Remini shows how J set us on the course of first continental, then international conqest. Without his seizure of the floridas there would have been no precedent for the future ""annexation"" of the remainder of the land we now call the United States. Anyone interested in american history would do well to study Jackson's life as well as his carrer in public life. Remini's biography is definetly the place to start."
1,Dwarfed Fruit Trees,This book is not worth what I paid for it. The book is an old library book in bad condition. The pages are stained and very dirty. Books like this should not cost as much as it did.
1,Counterfiet/knock-off/fake/not real,"Everything-On-Go sold me FAKE product!!!I ordered (4) Stud 100 Male Genital Desensitizer Spray. What they sent was NOT the real thing.From the first spray I knew something was wrong because it smelled very different than the Stud 100 I have used before.4 of: Stud 100 Male Genital Desensitizer Spray, 7/16- Fl. Ounce Box [Health and Beauty]Condition: NewSold by: Everything-On-Go (seller profile) $3.99Perhaps the $3.99 price should have been my first warning that I would not get the REAL thing. Buyer beware!!!"
4,Mellow for a Morricone Score,"This music seldom rants, but it makes its points. There is a quiet sadness to some of this music, as if evoking a time forever lost and things done and said that can't be taken back. Cockey's Theme with the pan flute is one of my favorites, as is the Poverty piece. Deborah's Theme seems a bit long and sometimes bland, but it has a haunting quality all its own. There is also a nice pick of period music, especially during the Depression/Prohibition years. The concert suite at the end does a nice job of summarizing the story in music, with some of its different orchestrations."
5,Once Upon A Time in America Soundtrack,This is one of the best and most underrated movies and soundtracks that I know of. It is truly music made with passion and the arrangements are superb
5,Once Upon A Time in America,I received this cd in excellent time! The music is as haunting asI remembered it in the movie. Thank you for your quick response.
5,A work of art,"Once Upon a Time in America is, in my opinion,one the greatest films ever. But it wouldn't be half as emotional and haunting without this remarkable soundtrack to accompany it. From start to finish it just draws you in and dosen't let go! Every song is a work of art. Listen to this soundtrack, you won't be disapointed."
1,BOO!,"I love ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"" by Eiffel 65, and so does every songle other person in my school class. Just this week, though, one of my best friends, who also loves ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"" by Eiffel 65, said that he and his parents went on a trip the past weekend. While looking through an outlet of The Wall there, my friend saw a single with a picture of the Eiffel tower on it that said ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)."" He bought it, brought it back to his hotel room, and put it on his headset. It turns out that the song was a generic copy of the song ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"" and it was by a group called Tower 32. My friend is going to write a letter to the store soon and ask for a refund. I hate replacements for the real thing. If you want ""Blue (Da Ba Dee),"" get the original version by Eiffel 65. BOO!Now my friend and I say the same thing: ""You know what song I hate? 'Blue (Da Ba Dee)' by Tower 32!"""
1,This Song is BAD!,"My friend bought this CD. I listened to it because I told her that it was not the real song because the real ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"" is by Eiffel 65. When I listened to it, I wanted to rip my ears off. The singing is so bad. I don't know how any store can sell this cra*."
5,"Rita, Boyer, Laughton, W C, Edward G this can't miss","I have high hopes for this video. The cast is super great, Rita Hayworth and Charles Boyer and W C Fields and still it goes on...Edward G Robinson and Charles Laughton and all about the traveling Tale coat. I have seen this movie about 25 years ago, and so I don't remember it well. I have planned to watch it on Christmas night with my family, after a huge supper. I think every one will love it. Old movies rock."
4,fields,"The studio apparently agreed with the previous reviewer, since the W.C. Fields segment was cut from the movie when it was initially released in theaters."
3,And thereby hangs a tale--or five!,"Like ""The Yellow Rolls Royce"", ""Tales of Manhattan"" is a movie about a single object owned by many different people over time, and how the object plays a role in the lives of those owners, in this case, a formal tailcoat. ""Tales of Manhattan"" is a virtual Syms clothing store of a movie, chock full of ""names you must know"": Ginger Rogers, Henry Fonda, Charles Boyer, Rita Hayworth, Charles Laughton, Edward G. Robinson, Cesar Romero, and WC Fields. I think it is about one tale too long--the WC Fields one--and that's why I bobbed this tail down to 3 stars instead of 4. His skit is way too long and frankly rather boring. Otherwise, there's a melodrama, a few get-out-your-hankie pieces, and a comedic romp. Really an omnibus, with something for everyone. Unless you're into WC Fields, fast forward when you get to that one, and you'll be okay."
4,Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator,I like this unit because it travels with me and is the only portable one I know. It's an effective cleaner. Expect it to last about two years based on my previous experience.
1,Very disappointed - broke after 5 weeks,I've only had this irrigator for a few weeks but a few days ago it became useless. It goes into a pulsing action and the pressure pushes the tip out - it won't stay in. I thought it might be the batteries and replaced them but no difference. Since I bought it in the States but am in Paris France for several months to come it's not worth sending back so I'll have to throw it away. Very disappointed.
5,Great for invitations,i used these to make some invitations for a 15nera. I used to make them the exploding box tops and they worked great.
3,Falls just short of greatness,"After reading the great ""Things Fall Apart"" by Achebe, I had high expectations of this book. I came away befuddled. I guess we were supposed to learn that a man cannot overcome his village, but still..I didn't get how it could have ended like that."
1,"Though many say this book is wonderful, I just don't see it.","We were forced to read this book in my 10th grade English class along with Things Fall Apart and No Longer At Ease. I found all of his writing to be dull and non-captivating and his plotlines, uninteresting. I was one of the few in my class who actually bothered to finish the book, and I am sorry I did because it was such a waste of time. Not only are there so many more authors who write so much better than Achebe that we should be reading in school, but also we should not be subjected to expletives in our literature. It was like Achebe had just discovered curses and sex for the 1st time and wanted to use as many references as he could in the book. Students should have some say in the language and subject matter that they have placed in front of them."

5,Dust mop,I love this old fashion mop. I have not been able to find a mop like this in the stores. Great thsnks.
2,Fuller dust mop,After using the mop I found it very stiff & hard to manuver around stuff. nice fluffy mop. a little short for me
1,Defective toothpaste was sent,"I ordered this toothpaste, which was sold by Amazon LLC, and immediately noticed it had a weird consistency, but figured it was the formulation. At some point it occurred to me to look at the expiration date and I discovered that the expiration date was in the month before I bought the item. If I ever buy something like this again via Amazon, I will definitely check the dates as soon as I receive it. But,in this case buying at the store is probably the better bet."
3,Not As Good As Rembrandt Dazzling White Toothpaste,"Rembrandt Intense Stain toothpaste is not bad, but no whitener approaches Rembrandt's Dazzling White toothpaste 5-pack of past years...which is now impossible to find. I'm really curious as to why a very effective and user-friendly product would be discontinued. One theory is that Rembrandt changed hands and the new owners re-evaluated the stock. If this is true, they certainly made a drastic mistake by discontinuing their most successful and well-liked product."
1,Worst toothpaste ever!,"This is perhaps the worst toothpaste I have ever used. The paste came out like running water. By the time I put the toothpaste on the brush and put the cap back on the tube, 90% of the toothpaste that was on the toothbrush had dripped off into the sink. Buyers beware of watery toothpaste; you've been warned!!"
2,it doesn't work,This toothpaste did not whiten my teeth after about 2 weeks of use there as no differenceone two three
2,Honestly After One Months Use,"Well, before I bought, I read the reviews, some folks said it was terrific, others said it didn't work. Well I honestly tell you, after one months use morning and night faithfully, I haven't noticed much diffference at all. I even got the whitening mouth wash too. Now I don't drink coffee, and I don't smoke, I don't chew, I have average teeth color for my age. But this honestly didn't work as significantly as advertised. It did however cause my front teeth surfaces to be sensitive and ache, so I had to occasionally place my warm tongue over them to stop the hurting on occasion. I've stopped using this product for a few days now and the hurting surfaces have stopped hurting and will probably donate the other two unopened tubes to a relative. Think I'll be trying a natural toothpaste now. I've been through so many others. I'm sincerely telling you the truth...but maybe you'll be one of those folks who get instant bright white teeth! Who knows. There's no gaurantee."
4,good product mix it before use,Great toothpaste. I read some reviews about it being watery. When I got them I mixed them up within the tube by compressing it back and forth several times and I had NO problem! :) Very good thanks
1,Don't waste your money,"I have finished the entire tube and, after brushing twice a day, my teeth aren't any whiter. Don't waste your money"
1,toothpaste not ordered,"I ordered one thing. A different thing came. I reordered. Another different thing came. I ordered again. The correct"" appearing"" item came. When I used it my mouth burned so much that I threw out all the remainder."
2,Not impressed at all,"I really didn't see any results after using this for about 3 months. I don't smoke, don't drink red wine, I just drink around 2 coffees/day, but this definitely didn't help. I wasn't expecting miracles, but was hoping for better results compared to the generic whitening toothpaste you can find in stores. Maybe it's just not a fit for me, maybe it works for some people."
4,Works great,This is great toothpaste really whitens. The reason I give it a 4 is because of the tube. I have arthritis and it is too stiff to bend. I know I have to get one of those devices to get the paste out. The other thing is there is very little in the tube. I never run out of the toothpaste so fast.
3,Teeth no whiter than before...,"Not impressed at all with this product. It works no better than my normal Colgate toothpaste and it is expensive. Over $6 for only 3oz. Will not buy this again. However, I did have a lot of success with stain removal by using a Staino tooth eraser.STAINO TOOTH STAIN ERSR 1 HNDL Size: 2 TIPSHighly recommend using the Staino tooth eraser for tobacco stains."
2,"No Es Un ""Grandes Exitos""","El título del CD es desorientador. Esta colección de canciones no es más que dos de los primeros trabajos de Sabina (Malas Compañias 1980 y Ruleta Rusa 1984) reproducidos integramente en un solo CD. No tengo conocimiento de que exista un CD de grandes éxitos oficial. Lo más cercano seria los CD en vivo ""En Directo 1986"" y ""Nos Sobran Los Motivos 2000"". Ambos son bastante representativos de los trabajos de Joaquín en el momento que salieron al mercado."
4,enjoyable light read,"I liked the layout of the book, the different narrative voices, the visually interesting collages. Light fun read when you just filed a massive brief or survived a huge software release that you know will give your friends in Tier 3 tech support ulcers. Not to be confused w/anything truly psychologically engaging like Patrick McGrath's Asylum, or anything by Josephine Hart & Joyce Carol Oates, but certainly better than anything on the NY Times bestseller list."
1,Terrible book,"I really was expecting something to keep me going, not something that an elementary student could write. I was really surprised."
1,"as ""deep"" and ""touching"" as Britney Spears ballads","Annoying as hell, this is by far their worst ballad ever. It's a shame Bono used the name of his father to sell even more copies from the overhyped How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. Unoriginal and boring, this song makes me feel sorry about U2. They have become the most pitiful self-parody in the history of music.Don't worry, surely they will win that paid Grammy for this crap, as well the album.I can't believe they still pretend to talk for the poor people. They are just a greedy corporation machine, with the support of Mojo, Billboard, Rolling Stone, MTV, Grammy, Time, NME, etc, etcEvery media want to take a piece of their golden cake !, and fans just want to tell them friends ""I WAS THERE !"" when the overhyped 'Vertigo' Tour starts. Everybody's fool. Shameful."
1,"""Ctrl Alt Del"" Please","I know this line won't seem to be serious but... I really have to do it:ZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzThis overrated ballad is nowhere near as good as their past ballads. It's clear most of U2 fans think they have sold out on this album (I'm one of them as well), with all that corporate propaganda, iPod, Apple Tunes, fake tickets, membership, www.u2.com, etc. We know that all artists has to renew themselves to sell albums to a younger audience. but we really didn't think that U2 would become one of them !.On ""Sometimes..."" Bono has basically taken the same rotten Grammy worthy formula from ""The Hands That Built America"". For worse, his voice sounds raspy and thin. The ""Climax"" part at 3 minute of the song is the most ridiculous U2 thing I've ever heard. Pathetic and irritating to say the least.[...]"
1,In response to Axver`s review,"Axver is an example of a blind childish U2 fan who defends with his life this sellout iPod band that U2 have become.First of all, I`m as die hard fan as him, but I'm not childish, and I've my own feelings, nevermind if I`m against U2's fashionable mainstream.""U2 are refining their art"" ...with Ipod, too expensive tickets, an annoying official web site www.u2.com, membership, Apple tunes, lies, fake Grammy Awards, silly videos, horrible copy-paste songs, strained Bono`s voice, dreadful lyrics, the same guitars again and again, etc.""If the allegations against U2 were true, Bono would be singing ""I want you in my pants""and the song would be used as part of a Levis jeans ad. That hasn't happened and thegreatest rock band in the world""...What a fragile mind you have my friend, do you remember a song called 'Vertigo'?...U2 are selling their souls on itunes, and you love that.Come on and defend George Bush's war on Iraq as well, better luck !"
5,DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!,This is an awesome song from an incredible album by the GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD!
1,U2 v/s Celine Dion,"I really don't know which artist have become the worst crap on earth. Do you remember when a crappy With Or Without You version came up out there?. This single seems to be the same joke. An unoriginal rewrite from The Hands That Built America and Stuck In A Moment. U2 are now in the same status as Jennifer Lopez, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Sting, Celine Dion, etc. Tragic.I wouldn't tour this crap, if I had the chance to were them. At least, I have a non sellout truly honest sould, unlike them."
1,"""Bono is still honest in his soul"".","By the way, he has sold his empty soul both to show bussiness and to rich corporations as Apple, in order to make even more and more money. I don't know why they want to tour this pathetic piece of mainstream horses**t. This song is another too americanized crap, in the same vein as ""The Hands That Built America"". It's clear he just wants to win yet another Grammys for this lame effort.Even after several drinks and smokes, with a terrible hangover, I can sing better than Bono in this song. What a pitiful way to end a career Bono. Bono has become the new fat Elvis. Go home you sellout!."
1,U2's songwriting is dead,"this lame ballad represents the U2 double standard: On the right hand we have a band singing a 'sentimental' and 'deep touching' rather cliché song for adolescents whom cry when they listen to any diva as Britney, Christina, J.Lo, Celine, Jessica, etc, with an 'epic' production worthy of multimillionaire Hollywood movies as Titanic. All that plus a predictable, boring and shameful video, pathetic and sissie. On the other hand we have an extremely arrogant, egomaniac, self-indulgent, sellout, liar, greedy, billionaire, empty, materialist band, as appears on the cover of the single, completely dehumanized, without any feeling nor emotion.Tragic. U2's songwriting is dead."
3,Why buy the single?,"Why purchase the single? Buy the entire CD. Its worth it!! As far as U2 ""selling out"", I dont agree. Like any band they have evolved in all ways. I would like to erase the ""POP"" years but we all make mistakes and they definitely learned from that one! Although they have changed HTDAAB is very close to the BOY/OCTOBER era of songs. You may not like how they have changed but to say this last cd was ""crap"" is way off. Vertigo, quite frankly , is a song that I could do without but the majority of the cd is fantastic. Are they the U2 of 1987...NO, 1997...NO, not even 2001!!! but they are U2 and they are still the best band in the land"
3,A decent U2 Ballad,"Ok so it isn't their best ballad ever, but it certainly does not deserve one star status.It's true, Bono doesn't do well with the high notes. Yes the lyrics are basic but perhaps that is all the song was meant to be. Take the song on face value. I don't believe that this is the U2 quest for commercialism and money that some have suggested. I simply believe its a simple little song, with a simple little messsage that at face value is a good song.Some people read way too much into the musical psyche and try and extract greatness from every word out of an artists mouth. Appreciate the song for what it is. If you enjoy U2 as artists or have enjoyed them in the past, allow them room to do whatever they want, they have earned it. From everything I've ever heard about Bono and U2, corportate greed has never been their thing. In fact they have been overwhelmingly philanthropic, and last I checked not short of cash. Those reviews do not hold water, enjoy the song."
3,Won't anyone please review the other 2 tracks?!?,"I read all these acidic and/or whiny ""reviews"", trying to find out if the other 2 tracks on this cd are any good. I'm not a fan of ""Sometimes..."", but I'm generally not a fan of the U2 ballad.Anyway, if anyone actually gets around to writing an actual review of the whole cd, thank you in advance."
1,WHAT A BEAUTIFUL IPOD ITEM !,"Just take a look at the cover... a sellout band dressed up with so much expensive clothes, plus a $400 Bono's sunglasses. All that captured by an artificial shot. If that's 'emotive' then Steve Jobs bussiness are emotive as well. I can imagine Bono laughing at all you, 'sensitive' fans. He knew that using his father's cancer death thing this crappy synthesized lame ballad would be heartbreaker and Grammy worthy.Don't get me wrong, I DO LIKE U2, but if you want me to recomend you a ballad, go with 'Promenade', 'MLK', 'With Or Without You', 'Running To Stand Still', 'Mothers Of The Dissapeared', 'Heartland', 'All I Want Is You', 'One', 'Love Is Blidness', 'Stay', 'The First Time', 'If God Will Send His Angels', 'Please', 'Miss Sarajevo', etc, etc.This garbage is as bad as 'The Hands That Built America'. Sorry but that's the truth. Surely 5 stars fans will love that shameful cliché video as well."
5,Absolutely Interesting,"This book really helped me to understand some concepts of this branch of Buddhist philosophy. It's a more detailed explanation of Nagarjuna's thoughts, it's helpful for the scholar in a school context and at the same time it gives the oportunity of a wide introspection."
2,Don't Bother,"Huntington is proud of his ""strong miss-reading."" But I say that unless your found of pretentious academic BS, read something different. A good academic read is Empty Words, by Jay L. Garfield. A better one still is The Ontology of the Middle Way, by Fenner. However, and I almost forgot, Huntington's book does have a translation of Candrakirti's The Entry into the Middle Way, which is cool. Still, read Huntington at the library and buy Garfield's Empty Words for home."
1,HORRIBLE! :BUYERS BEWARE!!,No description or warning was provided for the contents of this product!BUYERS BEWARE!This was intended to be a gift for the literary-loving teen but it contains an alarming amount of foul language and mature themes.Disappointed does not even begin to cover my feelings!
1,hardcore rightwing,"some of the music is interesting, but a lot of it is hardcore right wing , political propaganda.Of course I do not hold with their views, I belive Jesus has been misrepesented by the church. If I ever release a CD they will probally pan it, But I am gonna sing about Gods love for everyone and no exceptions. Im a blues man anywaysorry guys"
5,naive?,Written before my time. Written at a time when books for young adults where supposed to be more naive- and this book doesn't face teen pregnancy or confront social injustice in a democratic republic. But the portrayal of danger seems less naive than today's images of young adults whipping out their wands and taking on dragons.If it's hard to imagine a time and place where a barefoot kid had to save all summer for a pair of winter shoes then this book will help.If you're a Jersey boy this book is a must.My boss was a Piney and I hope more Pineys with kids find this book :-)
1,Low-Carb??,"At 18g of carbs, it's not very low carb. You're only allowed 20g during the induction phase."
2,FYI Not 100% Coconut Oil,"The product has 3 ingredients; Mineral oil, Coconut oil, and Fragrance. I am not 100% positive what Mineral Oil is, but everything I have read about it is rather negative."
1,THIS SUPPLIER IS AWFUL,"I love this product, however the supplier is the absolute worst I've ever encountered. This product should have been sent to me 2 weeks ago and I've still not received it. I had to send out 2 messages before they bothered to tell me it was on back order. If you can find this product from another supplier, DO SO."
2,Not Good for Champagne Flutes - Bad Return Policy,"I bought this to clean some Baccarat champagne flutes that are very narrow. The sponge material on the brush is stiff, and will not flex enough to reach the bottom of the glass. I checked the return policy for Winestuff, at their site: [...] The conditions and restrictions for returns are not customer-friendly at all. No opened packages are eligible, and anything ordered through Amazon is subject to a 6% restocking fee. I'll keep this, because it's not worth returning, and may use it for wine glasses. I won't order anything from Winestuff again."
4,An Inspiring Film.,These people were brave and wonderful and I found this to be a docu-drama worth buying.
5,Bielski Brothers,"After the students saw Defiance, they had many questions about the brothers and the things that they did. I felt that it was important for them to hear about what the brothers did from survivors"
4,Fun and challenging,"My daughter got the Eye Toy for her birthday, and we recently added the Dance Groove game to the collection. She and her friends (10 yrs of age) really enjoy it, as do some of the younger kids. She says her only complaint is that the most difficult skill level is nearly impossible to master, so they improvise... which is pretty easy to do if you stand really close to the camera."
1,not good game,"this game not very interesting and need a lot of time to manage and deal with it , also is not as expected on the graphics"
1,I DON'T like this game,"This game is NOT worth it!!!!!!!! It is pointless. I tryed it and it makes NO sense!!!!!!! I'm a kid, I would know. It is not fun for any kids. DON'T get this game!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Eyetoy=Good+PS2=Eyetoy Bad,EYETOY is great if it was on Gamecube OR XBOX its on PS2 the worst Console If you want PS2 Just cause of EYETOY dont get it its a huge waste of money not worth it if its on PS2
3,No zooming option,"Bought them last week.The magnification is good but there is no adjustment of zoom. I tried to look at birds and other distant objects but unless you know exactly where to focus, you won't be able to see them. There is no way to zoom out and then slowly zoom in.I am returning them today."
1,not good for hunting,dont buy this if you are going to use it for hunting. you cannot see anything right before dark when the deer are moving. i can never get it adjusted to where it has a clear picture. you have to keep adjusting them constantly. you just need to go ahead and spend 50 more dollars and get you some nikon binoculars so you can see right at dark and they keep a clear picture
1,You get what you have paid for.,A good Binocular would cost 10 times as much as this one ($400 and up).Just make one simple test: take this binocular and a good quality one (expensive) to watch Milky Way during dark clear night. You will see the huge difference.Overall: You get what you have paid for. Poor quality Binocular. Do not understand why this junk got such a big rating here.Stay away.
3,Big Power...,"Big power, but poor pupils exit, and dificult for astronomy observation, is necesary a tripod.Maybe a beeter options is Meade 9x63, or Bushnell 10x50.I think so."
2,limited use,"Bought a pair of these five years ago and used them maybe four times. A couple of days ago I got them out and when I took them out of the case the focus bar did not work and the eyepieces fell out. They were never dropped or mishandled. Great the few times I got to use them, but definitely not worth the money I wasted on them."
2,Nice if they wern't Cross-eyed,"The view close to 75 yards is good. At farther distances the view crossed because the tubes are not aligned. If you want these for distance and most people would, you might be ok if you look with justone eye. Would not recommend."
5,GREAT PAIR OF BINOCULARS!!,"THESE WORK GREAT! 16XPOWER. A LITTLE ON THE BIG SIDE BUT WHAT THE HECK, FOR THE MONEY THESE WOULD BE GOOD FOR JUST ABOUT ANY PURPOSE. BUY THEM AND ENJOY!!"
3,nice binocular,"Nice binocular, the only thing is it take time to adjust it and due to last magnification it's hard to make the view stable due to shaking hands.."
5,Caprichosa la galleta,"Cuando yo probe los helados tio rico me dieron ganas de komprarme unos nuebos binoculares, estos son los mejaores,porque cuando los uso ma cuerdo de los helados esos.Viva buchnel, los mejaores vino-culares de la historia.aviso:Los binoculares bushnell probeen una exelente calidad y no recuerdan los helados"
2,Great monocular,"Was really looking forward to using these binoculars afterreading the other reviews, but they just don't work for meor anyone else I borrowed them to. Everything appears as""double vision"" and all the adjusting of the width etc justdoesn't help. When I close one eye they work great as amonocular, but for both eyes they cause headaches.My old $15 dollar binoculars never had this problem. Willbe returning them."
2,Not As Good as the PermaFocus,I purchased these with the thought that they would have a better distance viewing and still have the quality that the Bushnell 12x50 Permafocus had. Not so. They did have a great viewing capability but they would not focus. If you used one eye you could see ok but they never would adjust correctly to view through both eyes. Not sure if it was just a defective pair or what. I returned them and will get another pair of the 12x50 permafocus Bushnells. They work great.
5,Kewl!,"These binocs are awesome!! I've had a pair of these for over a year and I can't tell you how simple they are to adjust; they have this great ""see-saw"" type switch for focusing on objects. They have rubber around the body so when you drop them they don't get damaged!! Overall probably the best pair of binoculars I've ever had."
2,What could be wrong with a $99 media player?,"Well, it depends on what you are buying it for.As far as connecting to my network, it is hard-wired to my router and it popped right up. But like some other reviewers, setting up a wireless connection with WEP security is a royal PITA.As far as using it for music (of any format) and picture files, it does an acceptable job. However, I bought this unit to play back video recorded in MS-DVR format from 2 different computers. The problem is that it does not recognize this format so really, it is my fault for not researching this before buying this unit. Many of the third party media programs will transcode these into a recognizable video format, but no matter which program I tried (and I think I have tried them all!) it is very choppy and essentially un-watchable.Live and learn!"
5,Ukyo's Secret Sauce is one of the best DVD's I've seen yet!,"The Ukyo's Secret sauce episodes parts 1 & 2 were too funny! The part when Soun Tendo used his spookiness technique was cool! Ukyo drove him away with the stench of the terrible okonomiyaki sauce. Ranma really made the sauce, but Ukyo thought it was her fault.A Teenage ghost story was cool. Quite a twist at the end, but I won't ruin it for you. Kogane, the ghost, is really strange. Kuno doesn't know what he's getting himself into..."
1,speaks of a millions of years ago...,"When answering a question about dinosaurs, this book refers to events that happened millions of years ago. If your family is like ours and you are teaching your children about a ""young earth"", this book will not be a good fit for you."
2,Guidance for a specific audience,This book is one of a series which I bought for consideration for a parents' group. I found them a bit conservative and not quite suitable for this particular audience. I got much more out of Parenting for Peace and Justice.
1,"Beware! This is a MINI book, not a ""real"" book","There may be more than one ""version"" of this product out there, but what I received was not the full-size book specified in the description. It was, instead, a ""mini-book,"" about 2 inches square. Cute but not worth the price."
4,Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament,I was hoping for some more information that wasn't just statistical but overall it is very interesting. I am happy with it.
5,This book changed my life and made me realize I'M NOT CRAZY!,"Touched With Fire is by far the most life changing book I have ever read. Having suffered with Cyclothymia as long as I can remember, and also being an extremely creative person, I thought I was losing my mind...then I read this book. Kay Jamison explores the relationship between creativity and manic depressive illness in an amazing way. The excerpts of letters, etc., of great artists, writers and composers of the past are enlightening, inspiring, and devastating to read. They open up a new understanding of these individuals and what they lived with. This is a must read not only for those suffering from forms of manic depressive illness, but also those who are associated with them. Wonderful reading. INFORMATIVE, ENLIGHTENING, AND AMAZING."
3,It's hard to write objectively about your own illness.,"Personally, I think she should have called it 'The Bell Jar Curve'"
1,Touched With Fire,"This book is one of those academic tomes that, in my view, could be classified as a ""publish or perish"" type of book. There are more useless cross references than there is useful information. It drones on and on. The author has the knack of taking 20 pages of information and expanding it into a 200+ page book. Granted, there is some useful information in the book but it hard to filter out."
2,It almost makes something terrible sound exciting,"Well written by someone well read and educated - and admittedly mentally ill. Its that education that I think holds this book back. It interprets the illness, or frames it in terms of inspired creativity, rather than exposes.If you want to experience mental illness w/out going there yourself, read Schreber's 'Memoir of my Nervous Illness'"
5,Brilliant,"But what else do you expect from Jamison? Opens the door,and explains mystical traits of MD in detail. Really lovely, and Important Book."
5,An interesting analysis,"All of Kay's books are great, and ""Touched With Fire"" is no exception- it's well written, well researched, easy to follow, and very interesting. Kay summarizes many of the relevant studies on the subject of bipolar disorder and creativity, and some of these studies are her own. I agree that bipolar disorder probably has a higher rate of prevalance in the artistic community, though I don't think this is the whole story- many artists simply don't exhibit the disorder, so what about them? What I really believe is that artists have a super high level of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which may be the chemical that is cycling up and down in bipolar disorder. Either way, this is a very interesting book that will appeal to a broad audience. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
1,Way off.,"Jamison's opinion of Herman Melville is way off. Melville has been appropriated to most every taste, and need. Difficult to accept that given his achievement, he was surprisingly 'normal.' Wagneknecht had it right, in reading Melville, one must distinguish between biography and autobiography of the reviewer."
3,Fascinating but scholarly,"The biographical content and thesis of this book are wonderful. However, for a lay audience it sometimes wanders into the academic arcane. At some moments, KRJ lapses into a discourse clearly meant for her professional colleagues who aren't quite up to date on either the science or history of this disorder. The rest of us just have to wait these intervals out. I recommend this book for those interested in poets and poetry, and for those who teach about them."
3,Not really my Thing,"While this book was really not that interesting to me, despite the fact that my brother is bipolar, certain chapters rang so true and brought me to tears. It is a factual book, but Redfield (the author) seems as though she is affected by the disorder. So reading her accounts was intrguing on that level.The best part was the incredible lists she offers of all the famous artists who have been manic-depressive: Sylvia Plath, Leigh Hunt, Dante Rossetti, several former political leaders and even Presidents of the USA! Amazing!"
2,least of her books,"This is one of my favorite authors on the subject of mood disorders, but the book was a disappointment. Most of the information about creative people that she used is well known and documented in other sources. Ms. Jamison did a nice job of explaining the family history of some of our favorite creative people of old, defining the link between mood disorders of family members. As an artist my interest was in those who had been successfully treated for their disorder and lived to be creative again. This book was an analysis of THE PAST, statistics relating to the resuming of creative careers after treatment were not in this book. I very much enjoyed her other writing but this was a detailed rehash of old information and didn't offer much beyond dry research and statistics."
1,dissapointed,I just couldn't read this book. others may really love it but I found it to be romanticized and wordy.I really havent been able to get past the first 2 chapters.i thought it sounded great but....not what i thought it would be.
5,I think this cd is da bomb,I think that this cd really shows and appreciates how good bob marley was. the song selections are great 5 stars!
1,Complete Disgrace,"Like the other records in this series, this stuff is largely discards and inferior stuff Marley himself NEVER spoke well of when he was alive. There ought to be a law against exploitation like this. Rita Marley and family deserve sympathy for having to face weirdness this unpleasant."
1,Crass Exploitation,To package these fourth-rate table scraps as if they were fit to digest is just wrong. Marley and his loyal fans deserve more respect. Nuff said.
1,Bob Himself Would Cry Foul,"At no point in his entire life and career was Bob Marley known to have spoken well of the sub-grade junk gathered together here and treated as if it's remotely fit to listen to, let along spend money on. Marley himself would cry foul that this throat-clearing demo dross-which was meant to stay on the cutting room floor-has been retrieved from the dustbin for money-grubbing purposes. Back weh, vampires!"
2,eh,It is an ok product. A bit cheap feeling and also it wasn't advertized for which psp system it belongs (I got the wrong one although I should have checked so it's my own fault). Nice packaging though.
5,Blending Cultures...Blending Music?,"I heard Fanshawe speak when he visited my college a few years past. I had to pick up this CD after, and it has been a staple of my musical diet ever since. It is a stunning musical blend of a traditional Sanctus and African tribal music (forgive me if my terminology is wrong, I'm an English major, not a music major). Without wanting to get pithy and/or didactic about harmony and diversity, it truly shows how lives and faiths blend through this incredible music.For example, check out the ""Kyrie: Call to Prayer."" This is a juxtaposition and combination of the Muslim and Christian faiths, as it combines the traditional Christian kyrie liturgy with the recital of the Azan, Call to Prayer, which Fanshawe received special permission to record in the Muhammad Ali Mosque in Cairo.It's amazing. If you can't take my word for it, check it out yourself."
2,Look around for the good one.,"This is but a pale shadow of the great Missa Luba by Les Troubadours du Roi Baudouin. Unfortunately, that version is only available on vinyl. Look for it on eBay. It is not Westernized or a symbol of our imperialism. It is pure joy from the heart!!! And, once you've heard it, you will not settle for this. However, I give it two stars for effort."
2,The parts just do not fit together.,"While I don't for a moment doubt Fanshawe's sincerity, scholarship, personal spirituality or connection to the music he experienced in Africa, his Sanctus is essentially undone by cultural imperialism - the British man in search of ""mo roots."" The parts just do not fit together. Nor has Fanshawe fully absorbed his influences. I guess he's really an ethnomusicologist after all. On the other hand, his compilation of African music, ""Spirit of African Sanctus,"" is a wonderful album.Bob Rixon - WFMU"
3,Super Reader,"Dr Caligari brings his glass coffin and travelling carnival to Sunnydale. Anyone that goes is affected by one of the Seven Deadly Sins. The good doctor needs to do some soul sucking to continue to keep himself alive, and to recruit some nice cheap labor to keep his show going.Not only that, but Ethan Rayne is looking to do a deal with Caligari.Everyone in the scoobies is affected, as is Giles, and only with the help of Jenny Callendar do they get things under control."
4,good product but formerly mislabeled description,"EDIT: at the time of this review, the product title read ""4-pack,"" It has since been corrected to 2-pack."" The drill bits work fine.These are good items, but are in fact packaged with only two bits. Amazon customer service sent me a new order and asked me to return the defective order. But they sent me another 2-pack, rather than the 4-pack described.Eventually, they told me to keep the first order, so now I have my four bits, as offered. Four good bits for an excellent price, but a bit too much aggravation.And now I feel compelled to put small holes all over my house and office to get good use from this cornucopia of perforators."
3,Described as 4-pack but I only received a 2-pack,"I would rate it 5 stars except that the DW1905 package only contains 2 bits, not 4 as described. I emailed customer support and they promptly sent another 2-pack to correct the problem. Great job Amazon customer support. Terrible job whoever writes the product descriptions."
3,"Good, but could be better","This 4th DVD set of The Saint adds another 7 episodes to the collection. The positive side of the set is that the picture quality is -as always with A&E- good and the fact that there are 7 instead of the usual 6 episodes on the two disc set. The negative side is the fact that the extras are rather disappointing as they are completely identical as the ones of set 1 and 2 except for the episode trailers. I hope this is not a sign that set 5 and 6 that will follow later this year, will be identical as well. Any respectable fan of The Saint or Roger Moore will of course buy them, but there is so much material available to add as extra features on the DVD sets it's a shame to let this opportunity pass."
5,PERFECT.......,I really love this CD. I bought this for background music while doing Yoga. This is PERFECT for what I bought it for. Very relaxing and nice for bedtime or quiet background music with guest. I have gotten compliments and inquiries about this CD from others who have heard it in my home.
2,great potential,This was fun the first time we set it up. It is not a pop up therefore you use rods which crack and break upon movement. The tent part ripped along the zipper and if we want to use it now (it's been set up about 4 times) we have to tape it together. I would not suggest this product.
4,Princess Tent for Granddaughter,"My granddaughter loves this ""princess tent."" She had to sleep in it the first night. There was plenty of room. She picked it out from several I showed her on the internet, even though she's only 4. She's loves to play in it with her 2 year old sister. It is a permanent fixture in her room. It's been more than a month and it is still holding up to the torture of two little girls."
4,One Child Two Languages,This book is very good for an introduction to second language teaching. It offers practical classroom advise on areas you need to pay attention to.
4,Sexual Fantasies,"This book was hard to put down. I was soo wrapped in the plot and the courage of the main character, time flew by and I read this book in an afternoon! If you like hot steamy encounters and fantasy brought to life, this book is a must. If you are sqeamish about non-monogamous sex, this book is not for you."
5,American in Japan for some years,"This book helps. It not only clearly conjugates 600 common verbs but then gives 5 example sentences in English plus the Japanese translation in romaji. The headers indicate to which group the verb belongs and whether it is transitive or intransitive. Helpful. The kanji is a nice touch. The book does omit the prohibitive form. (E.g. Don't sit there!) I tried BARRON'S 1991 J verbs pocket book. The type is too small. The above book is 6x9 inches so the type is easy to read. Finally, there's a list of 277 commonly used NOUN + SURU verbs with kanji. The book was done by a team of teachers in Tokyo who used feedback from real students trying to learn Japanese. I'm pleased with this book."
5,A must have for the Japanese language student,"I class this item as a must have. I refer to this book many many times when I want to make sure or correct my Japanese. As a minor in my University, it's imperative to have the correct grammar, and this always leads me the right way. AND examplessss on how to use each very in their different forms. Excellent book."
4,Another one undone by greed and a drug addled mind!,"How can a well educated, well qualified high earning dentist get away with such an enterprise? This story is amazing! Another rags to obscene wealth and inevitably back to rags via a long stretch in prison. Don't these guys get it? There is only one result in the end for all the subterfuge and corruption you have to exercise in the pursuit of a fortune in this manner!!! An excellent read!"
5,page turner,"really fun, easy read. liked it a lot better than killing pablo, much more readable. Glad I gave Bowden another chance this was a cool story. He really makes out the main character to be a good guy who didn't deserve to go to jail despite dealing a ton of coke. like, an actual ton."
5,Loved it,"A great, page turning read. I enjoyed the book so much I just purchased all of Mark Bowdens books. Grabs you from page 1 and doesn't let up. Truth is stranger than fiction really wins out here."
2,Blah,"I read this after I had already read Mark Bowden ""dr.snow"" and that made this book look like a second grader had written it. She got too close to the enemy(Lavin) and it showed in her telling. She glossed over his scum lifestyle and tried to make Reed, the agent that took him down, look like some Ahab-esque character hunting the white whale. Reed was a great agent doing his job getting a low life thug doctor off the street.Read Bowden's ""Dr.Snow"" for a balanced and fantastically written account of Dr. Lavin"
4,Good read,"Not Bowden's best (I give that honor to Killing Pablo), but still a page-turner. I wanted to meet Larry Lavin after reading this. Has a bad guy ever been portrayed so well? He had charisma, intelligence, charm, and even worked in a job where he helped people. It doesn't even seem like Lavin was the type to intentionally hurt people through his ""other"" business. Bowden almost has you cheering on Larry as you progress through the pages. Perhaps it has something to do with how complex Larry is, and Bowden captures it magnificently.They say ""truth is stranger than fiction"" and this book proves it. I can't believe they haven't made this into a movie yet.If you're a fan of Bowden, this is a must-read."
5,Engrossing read!,"Larry Lavin is a brilliant, complex person, who, despite his enormous crime, emerges as likeable. One cannot help but think, ""what a waste!"" This is the story of a man who truly had everything: brains, looks, loyal wife, money career, and beautiful children. Yet, he threw it all away. Fascinating account of Lavin's ascent from poor working-class Massachusetts kid with disillusioned father to dental student to coke lord to inmate."
4,very good read,"an interesting look at the life of a drug dealer who really seems to have thought he did nthing wrong. the ""everyone does it"" mentality seems to have kept him going all the way to jail. good supporting cast of characters keep it interesting."
4,What I Learned In College,This was a fascinating story....from dorm room dealer to cocaine kingpin.....they should make a movie about this guy.....Mark Bowden is a pretty good writer too
3,Confused?,"I'm in the middle of reading this book and am slightly confused. I am doing a report on George Jung for American History, and while researching him I found a link to this book. In reading the first page of the book it tells that the events and story are true- just that the names have been changed. The description on the cover, ""The Rise and Fall of an All-American Boy and His Multimillion-Dollar Cocaine Empire"" even describes George Jung. None of the events in the book pertain to George Jung, though. So who are we really reading about? Please email me at Stilettosgirl51@aol.com if you have any idea!"
1,This book is a bomb,This is just another sad example of so called experts who want to justify hitting children. I hope parents will have more sense then to buy into this fallacy.
1,Shame on John Rosemond,"John Rosemond who can often be on target when it comes to child discipline falls way off the mark here. While describing the fear that his own chidhood spanking caused him, he simultaneously gives permission to parents to hit kids. This mean-spirited and creativity-less approach is well below what we should expect from him."
1,"Once again, we see an old testament orientation.","By now, it should appear obvious to all that spanking apologist professionals invariably represent conservative christian beliefs."
2,Convinced me NOT to spank my kids!,I think the author's goal was to tell you that it's OK to spank - but the more I read the more I was glad I've chosen not to spank my children. some of the examples and stories were downright scary - spank a 10-year-old for not wanting to unload the dishwasher? Yikes! If you want to read a book with good/positive/practical discipline ideas that really work try Perfect Parenting by Elizabeth Pantley.
1,Another example of an abused person himself,"John Rosemond was abused by his mother, beaten many times, and was abandoned by his father. Is it any wonder this man supports beating children? TEENS?? Geez...these nut cases crawal out of the woodwork and endanger children. He is no better than the other supportor of child beatings in the Christian world, James Dobson. Please, parents, run the other direction. This man has very little understanding of the love, and teachings of God. His own opinions is exactly what they are..his own. Having raised sons without ever raising a hand by TEACHING them self discipline, leading by example, helping them to make GOOD choices, giving them proper NON-PHYSICAL consequences, and holding them accountable in a non-physical way works wonders for your children. Ban this book, or, at least, if you want your children to grow up in a HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT, do not buy it."
1,Rosemond should be spanked for writing this book!!,Sounds like Rosemond needs a dose of his own medicine! Either STOP writing child abuse books or take a dose of your own medicine! Take a few pops yourself on the rear with a big bare hand! STOP making children's lives miserable and messed-up!
3,"Finally, A Balanced Discipline Book!","Writers always seem to want to bash spanking, even though the research has never proven spanking is bad (90% of parents have spanked!). This book gives very good suggestions and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an unbiased discipline book."
3,"They work, kind of...","...until you open the freezer or refrigerator door!Depending on what brand and type of hinges your doors use, it may make the extension touch the other side surface, causing it to lift up one of the magnets of the piece touching, causing it to slide down, and become misaligned with your track setup. If you don't open your doors all the way, then you can avoid the problem.We ended up just using them to jump between the two doors of our side-by-side, and this works pretty well, although you still have to have a pretty good jump, because these extensions SLOW the marble down."
4,ideal starter stick,I bought a set of these hockey sticks for my 6 year old son. One in Red and one Yellow and the are ideal for his first street hockey sticks. Order arrived on time and packaging was suitable.
2,Strange Party Brew,"Strange but alright party mix, featuring classics from Blondie with one hit wonders like Jesus Jones. Funky hits like ""Move This"" by Technotronic / Ya Kid K and Adam Ant's ""Good Two Shoes are fun, but Blind Melon's ""No Rain"" seems a strange choice for a party compilation. All in all an average cd."
4,let it Snow!,"I like this game because it uses simple logic to plan how to deal with ice and snow storms. Also, the fact that it is cooperative, makes it a great game to bring up conversation about why or why not to do something. If you've ever lived in the snow belt, having a plan to shovel out is helpful, so this game helps young kids to start learning these skills. I also love that a bag is provided to put all of the little pieces so they do not walk away between games. Amy"
5,Non-competitive fun game,"These games teach children how to work together to solve ""non-violent"" situations. They are cleverly written and enjoyable by all the family as well as friends."
5,A great inexpensive scrub,"I have been using this scrub (sensitive skin, original, and the acne varieties) for over 10 years now. It's a great basic scrub that is inexpensive. I use it every morning in the shower and my makeup goes on a lot more evenly once I've exfoliated with it. My best friend tried it out when she stayed over my place and has been using it ever since as well. Even my boyfriend loves it and says that it prevents ingrown hairs on his face and neck from shaving. This is a great scrub and I'm going to keep buying it as long as St. Ives is making it. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
3,Pretty good,"It's a good item, but I'm used to the EXFOLIATING or the RENEW scrub. This GENTLE scrub has much less beads in the solution so it exfoliates less. Good product for the price, but I prefer more beads to take off that dead layer of skin."
4,Great for sensitive skin,"St Ives has many products for skin, but their apricot scrubs really work for little money. I used to use the original scrub where you could really feel the ground apricot pits. My skin was incredibly smooth and soft after using. I'm older and my skin is much more sensitive so I switched to the gentle sensitive kind. It really is gentle. You can still feel the ground pits (if that's what they still use,) has no overpowering perfume, and removes dead skin while refreshing your face. I gave it 4 stars only because I really loved the original product when my skin was in better shape. I will continue to purchase this product."
3,not as good as the non sensitive one,"I agree with someone else saying this is not as good as the one not for sensitive skin. I've been giving away the tubes I got on this 6 pack. I went to the supermarket to buy the other one, huge difference, original one does exfoliate your skin very nicely.Make sure you can't use the other one first before trying this one out."
5,Fascinating Read!,"I purchased this book to write a paper for a sculpture class. I had bought one other but tossed it aside and spent the majority of my time soaked up in this book. It is full of images of Camille's works as well as some images of Camille herself. Aside from the information about her life before, during, and after Rodin, there are also many personal letters to and from Camille that have been translated into English. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and still spend time looking through it even though that sculpture class is history."
2,battery eater,"the camera is good, but it goes through batteries very fast, I would get rechargeable ones if you get this camera. I mean every time you use it you need new batteries."
1,WISH I HAD READ REVIEWS FIRST!,"I now realize how important your reviews are..All my family laughed at my useless shower radio. The knob is so tiny you cant hold on to any radio station, and if you do, the sound is terrible. To think I actually paid a shipping fee! Thank you Amazon, for your interest in your customers, taking time to offer us such valuable feedback. I promise I will read all reviews BEFORE buying!"
2,"Great sound, cheap plastic, poor build quality",I was very happy with the headphones for a month. I unpacked them one day and the right plastic pivot had broken although they were stored properly in their protective case. No luck getting them fixed or replaced under warranty. They may sound as good as Bose headphones but not near the quality. You get what you pay for. Be gentle with them and you should be alright.
1,very cheap product,"This product worked for the first 2 days, I was so excited to have my phone finally charge again. But after 2 days it stops charging my phone.This charger was very cheap and could not be trusted"
1,Charger didn't work,This charger did not work with my phone. Not sure if it was a compatability issue or a poorly made product. I checked carefully to make sure the model number of my phone matched the charger and it still did not work. Disappointing.
3,Gets the job done,The charger itself charges the phone perfectly fine but the cord is very very short. I ended up having a friend giving me hers because I couldn't stand how little the cord was.
4,works great,"Works great, I think maybe those other reviews had issues with their phones.Only reason not 5 stars, is the plug seems a little 'loose'-it doesnt stay in the wall very well.I don't know how they sell if for that price, it would cost me that much just to ship it.very happy"
1,ROSZA,"There seems to be an amazing amount of film soundrack recordings done by second rate Euro orchestras of late. None of which seem to match the original soundtrack versions. This so called Epic recording is a prime example. Quickly and cheaply recorded-lacking understanding and soul of the originals--and more important because of time limitations--no rehearsal time with instruments being out of tune. . .this recording is another attempt to cash in on the nostalgia wave of collectors. It fails miserably. Listen to the originals and match them to this out of tune, out of phase recording and mourn the loss of any record company doing justice to the originals. This is a cheap cash in on the nostalgia craze and anyone who has a reverence to Varese, EMI, Chandos, Southern Cross or other labels that might still attempt to preserve original film musics (there are still several)--should try and revert to the originals. This is horrific stuff. Order at will."
4,Epic Rozsa,"The Allwyn conducted Rozsa has much to offer in giving a cursory but nicely sequenced choice of Rozsa's epic scores.The cuts from El Cid,'Brummel,and Sinbad are of particular excellence.The love theme from Cid is nicely played without milking the inherent sentiment.It is really nice to hear what Sinbad would have sounded like had the original recordings been true to Rozsa's intentions. And the ""Bovary waltz is a beautiful coda to the proceedings.The copy I heard was in mint condition."
3,One Killer Song,"You have to get this album if its just to listen to: How does it feel?The first three tracks are also really awesome. The whole album is good. (I believe if the album is good it should get a 3, great a 4 and totally awesome is 5."
1,Gag me with a (silver) spoon!,A load of pretentious drivel that would embarass Joyce Kilmer or the Reader's Digest. Let the poor folk who died in 9/11 rest in peace! Self serving in the Bob Geldof or Bono mode.
1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER !,"My complaint isn't with the show itself. It's with Warner Home Video. I purchased this DVD from Amazon. It arrived shortly thereafter. However, when I opened it, it had two disc ones, and NO disc two. I called the customer service number on the box and explained the situation. They were very polite and said they were a ""fulfillment"" company but would forward the problem to Warner Home Video.To make a long story short, I have called a total of five times since early December, and been totally ignored. ALL I WANT IS THE RIGHT DISC. Perhaps Warner Home Video is so big it can ignore customers with impunity, but as a lifelong Superman geek, I'm terribly disappointed.WARNER HOME VIDEO, DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS?"
2,Disappointing ending to the season. . .,"As a long time fan of Lois and Clark, I was really looking forward to this last season, but on rewatching the entire season I realized that I didn't recognize anything past the 1st 4 or 5 episodes. Then I realized why. The entire show is a bit cheesy, and I love it for that very reason, among others; however this season takes the cake. I must have deliberately stopped watching the show to save myself from the inanity of the new episodes.For closure you need the first disk and maybe the second, but that is definitely where the show should have ended. In the end, as sad as I am to say it, I think that I will preserve my memories of Lois and Clark in the earlier seasons and endeavor to forget that I wasted about 14 hours of my life on this last season."
3,Not Bad,"I bought this season because Patrick Cassidy is in three episodes. As always he was terrific. I'm not big on superhero stuff, but this show is fun to watch and is highly entertaining."
2,Last Seaon for a Reason,"I remember when this show was canceled, I was disappointed, though I have to say that I was starting to miss more and more episodes by that time, and once it was gone, it wasn't really missed. The Lois in trouble in revealing outfits schtick was getting old, the show was at an all time camp hi, Teri Hatcher was getting one of the biggest egos in tv, at least until she got on Desperate Housewives, and all the romance that made the first couple of seasons so special is kind of played out being that the two are already married, and this show really isn't mature enough to demonstrate what a strong and healthy relationship is supposed to look like. The only reason that I gave this show a second star is that there is one scene where one of the nemesis makes fun of lois not recognizing superman from Clark by taking on and taking off a pair of glasses going look i'm superman, no clark kent, no superman. Yeah good moment, bad seaon, and I already ruined the moment."
1,Non-stop snogging in the fourth season,"Lois and Clark smooch constantly. Entirely way too much kissing. Loud, overdone sounds of smacking lips all the time.The show suffers without Lex Luthor.I couldn't suspend disbelief for the scenes on Krypton or New Krypton...whatever. The characters were too weird. No one was likable there and they came across as dead."
4,my favorite superman,"I say, I'll always love and believe that Christopher Reeve's is the Best Superman... Dean Cain is definately my FAVORITE Superman. I will always be in love with Teri Hatcher, and she is most definately my favorite and best Lois Lane. (even with the ever-changing hair-dos!)"
5,"Nice price, and brand new!",I looked around and couldn't find a good price until I checked Amazon. Now I check Amazon first.
1,personaly!!!!,"This wasnt superman, this was a a funny show that tried to be funny more than anything nock off. superman, if ANYone knows the story, wasnt a very happy man, and wasnt funny at all. His family got killed and they sent him from another planet. would you be a happy man??? just saying... I would want to destroy the planet Earth!!!! expesially today... LOL"
3,Lois & Clark - The New Adventures of Superman - the 4th season,Item was given as a gift. I never watched this video.
4,winding down..,these last episodes are a little far fetched but entertaining and the romance angle is still cute. Having said that you will still keep watching to see how it all turns out.
5,Wonderfulexperence,Very happy with service all was done quickly and on time. The shipment arrived at my home in excellent condition. Will do this again Amazon is just the best.
2,Probably better to just watch the movie.,"Watch the movie first for the breathtaking special effects. Only then if you're interested, should you buy the book, because it has a few more details in it. I pity those who bought the hardcover."
2,don't waste your money,"It's called the best of the 70s, but it isn't. Instead, they also include tracks from the 80s and 90s. Buy one of their 70s albums instead. The music is still good, but not in this format."
3,Assorted dance music,"Every single of the 12 songs included on this CD made the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart; however, not every single one of them is capable of heating up the dance floor. The biggest problem with this compilation is that the music's too varied for anybody's liking. People who dance to new wave (It's My Life, Really Saying Something, Hyperactive) would have problem dancing to 70's disco (Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now) and jazz-funk (US3). The saving grace of this CD are the sure-fire dance favourites, Politics of Dancing, Hot In The City, We Close Our Eyes, U Can't Touch This, Ice Ice Baby and Lies.In short, this CD comprises assorted dance music. It is an album to enhance one's singles collection (4 1/2-star rating), rather than a CD that rocks a party (3-star rating)."
4,Understanding molecular simulation,"This book is goof for studying molecular. For beginner, this book is easy to understand how to do."
3,"Mysore, India A day in the life of a yoga student","it's the real deal, but way over priced. $20.00, plus shipping, for 35 minutes of viewing time? wow! one more example of enlightenment for $."
3,Not as entertaining as expected,The story is very short. The additional features particularly the dance segment leaves a lot to be desired.
3,too long,"I found this jacket to be a nice material, but it is much too long. I did order a bigger size than usual, based on the sizing charts. It fits around the chest, but it hangs down too low and the sleeves are long."
4,"Not his best CD, but very good none the less","This album is not Kim Waters' best album, but it is still very good. The first couple tracks are the best. The improvisations and melodies are very good, but a lot of it sounds the same."
4,Quiet Storm Smooth Jazz At It's Best,"As a man who is known into his grown & sexy mode I know when it comes to music there's got to be a perfect mixture of romance, groove and a strong melody that you can hum along to after the first listen. Jazz is no expection and I always entertain guests with my mix CD'S. Kim Water's cover of Fournate is a jazz lover's paradise ."
5,THIS IS THE ONE,"LOOK NO FURTHER, THIS IS ALL YOU NEED FROM THIS GREAT AUSTRALIAN BAND. THEIR POPULARITY EQUALLED SOME OF THE GREAT BANDS OF THE LATE SIXTIES. THIS CD HAS 56 SONGS.FROM FRIDAY ON MY MIND TO A FEW GEMS YOU MAY HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE.. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED I'M SURE- STEVE CHAPLINAUSTRALIA XXXXX"
2,Wide field of view...but not sharp edge-to-edge,"These binoculars do have an extra-wide field of view (900' at 1000 yards, vs. 650' for the Bushnell Powerview 4x30's), as advertised. I purchased these specifically for watching NBA games from my third-level seats in the Rose Garden, and the field-of-view was about the size of the court. Unfortunately, the focus towards the edges is very poor, so I still had to move the binoculars back and forth to keep the action in focus. Also, either the fixed-focus or the lack of constant focus seems to force your eyes to do a lot of focusing work when you pan the binoculars. After following the players running up and down the court for about five minutes, my eyes had problems focusing without them for nearly an hour!I returned these and purchased the Bushnell Powerview 4x30's for about 1/8th the price. The Powerviews are smaller & lighter, and the view is razor-sharp edge-to-edge. You can't see as much of the court at once, but my eyes are much happier now."
5,BAM!!!,"If you have tough stains, this is the product for you. I cannot find this product on any shelves, so paying for shipping was well worth it. Once you use this product, you will not be happy with any other. You can even leave this cleaner on the surface and come back later and your stains will be gone. I use it on our tile shower and it cleans the grout like new. Try it, you will not be sorry!!"
2,Easy off Bam,Didn't work much better than regular toilet cleaner and it was way more expensive! Maybe it works better for other things.
5,Great book!,I was required to read this book (among 2 others) for my U.S. Military History class. The book is outstanding. Anyone interested in history and military strategy would find this as an excellent read.
4,Worth the money and time,I enjoyed the straight forward attitude that the author took in presenting a synopis of the PRAXIS. The tests that were in the book were more difficult than the actual test but that just made me all the more prepared. I would definitely recommend this as a good preparation for the PRAXIS.
2,No One Proof-Read This Thing,"The skills sections arent bad for reminding you of some simple things you need to know. But, most poepel buy these books for practice exams and these ones were TERRIBLE! I have only gone through the very first Diagnostic test and already 4 of the supposedly 8 answers I got wrong in the math section were errors on the part of the book. For example. Hopefully you see what is wrong with this statement made by the book. ""The answer is 700, becuse: 35 X 20 X 10 = 700. 7000 was in the answer options, but apparently the dumbies who wrote this book think that it wasn't correct.I'm not even motivated to check do the other 3 or 4 practice exams now, which basically make up the entirety of the book. I almost feel like asking for my money back. (P.S. I am refering to the 10th edition)"
2,Errors in 10th edition,I have to agree with the above review for the 10th edition- I have found several errors in the book! Not good when I need to brush up on my math. The review sections were helpful but errors are unacceptable.
3,"Easy to read and funny, but too basic","The book is well written and easy to read. The jokes were also welcome, especially when debt is involved. However, the advice was too basic and I learned nothing new. If you're a complete novice to the idea of budgeting and saving money, then this book would be helpful. I know the basic ideas, so I found it pretty useless. In addition, since the book was published in 2001, most websites recommended don't exist anymore or don't provide the same services. (and there are much better alternative sites available now). Given that a big portion of the book is dedicated to sites that can save money, this is a major drawback."
3,"Common sense, but at least it's not boring","This book is so much common sense. I just don't understand why people have a problem with budgeting. It's simple, don't spend more then you make! But if you do have a problem with this concept or need help getting out of debt, this book could help. Money saving tip - get it from the library!"
4,The Barracuda Triangle,This was my second favorite Mickey Mouse adventure book. Mickey goes to the Barracuda Triangle to solve a mystery. Kids in the 3-6 range will love it.
2,This is not original music of Ennio Morricone,"This cd represent a compilation of various tracks by Ennio Morricone and contains very popular themes. I give only 2 stars, because the music is poor compared to the original version composed by Ennio Morricone."
3,Still some hits...,"This was not the best thing Foghat ever did but there are a couple of standout songs that will remind any Foghat listener of the glory days of the band. Wide Boy is kind of a cheeky English 80's rock song that is a lot of fun, and Live Now Pay Later would fit right in on any of their bigger hit albums. There's some good stuff here, and if you're even a marginal Foghat fan you should buy it for those songs. I saw the current touring Foghat last night here in Denver with Charlie Huhn and Brian Basset. They put on a fantastic show, and I think they're even better than the original band. My only disappointment with their show was that they didn't play Wide Boy or Live Now Pay Later......."
2,"Just as bad as ""Tight Shoes""","I won't repeat my review of ""Tight Shoes"", but this album was just as lousy. Those two albums, coming out in the very early 80's, took Foghat completely out of the category of popular rock bands, and into obscurity for the most part.Don't waste your money on this bland bunch of music. Buy ""Live"" and ""Stone Blue"" for starters if you want to hear the REAL Foghat -- great music that rocks your socks off, with a hint of blues."
5,"Funny, Fun, & Fantastic","This is the funniest little anime bits I've seen in a long time. I really laughed hard. While the animation is good and consistant, it's not amazing as some purists may want it. Being 'shorts' allows for funny genre parodies that would probably have failed if they were any longer. While these bits are part of the Ah! My Goddess universe, there really is no need to know anything about A!MG to watch. If you need some comic relief, pick up a copy of Mini Goddess. You'll find yourself, for the first time, feeling sorry for a rat."
3,ha. ha,"This is the weirdest thing ever. The 3 goddesses of the ah my goddess series use their powers to become small! They hang out with this talking rat and do stuff!! Its funny but weird as hell. To get a taste for it and to see if you want to continue watching, I would buy the Ah My Goddess movie dvd, which has the first episode of the mini goddess series.(in my opinion I actually thought mini goddess wasn't that funny and kinda dumb)"
3,Likable Characters,"""Entourage"" is about Hollywood and about friendship, and so it's really nothing at all. ""Entourage"" is by season eight completely out of gas, and season seven cliff-hanger is that A-list celebrity Vincent Chase has been -- gasp! -- busted for using drugs. It's clear that the real star is neither Vincent Chase (who plays very well an actor who cannot act and who has no personality) or even his entourage, but his agent Ari Gold, who is what ultimately keeps the show going. Halfway through the season everyone is bored and tired, and just wants to move on with their lives so they do what anyone else in Los Angeles would find himself in the same situation would do -- they move to New York City."
2,Terrible Ending to a Great Series,No Spoilers.... I will say though that I was disappointed in this season. I thought season 7 wasn't great but was not terrible. Season 8 in my opinion was terrible. The story lines simply were implausible and poorly developed. The season seemed rushed and quite frankly I thought it was disservice to what in my opinion was the best show on TV. Farewell my entourage friends I wish we could have parted on higher note then season 8 but thats life..... Thanks for the many laughs throughout the years...
4,The end,Overall this was a very good and funny series. The ending was too phony with Vince and Eric. Really made no sense. It could have been better. Vince got better as the series went on but his ending really sucked. The best thing about this series is Ari. His story has been good all the way through. The way they ended his story was well done. Overall it was a very good series.
2,Don't feel much of anything,I bought this unit a little over a year ago and used it with other massage units around the body. I actually did not feel much of anything from this unit. It does not seem to be powerful enough to really massage the scalp. The only thing I got from this unit was a circle of little red bumps around the front of my head that take about an our to disappear where one of the massage sensors go.
2,IT'S 'O.K.',"I THOUGHT IT WOULD 'MASSAGE', BUT IT IS MORE OF VIBRATION THAN MASSAGE. IT IS SOMEWHAT RELAXING."
3,OK but not a great product,my mother-in-law is using this product and she said that the massager around neck is not strong enough.
4,HeadSpa Head Massager,"I LOVE it! I live with a headache every day. I've tried everything to ease the tension in the back of my head. This head massager works well for me. It doesn't take away all of the pain, but it sure does ease the pain a lot. The part of the massager that goes across the back of the head is what helps so much. I wish there was a little more pressure across the back of the head, but all in all I love it!"
4,Best of the Cuneiform lot,"Of the three Cuneiform Soft Machine archival releases, this is my favorite. It would serve as a good intro to the band, it has a bit more ""life"" than the studio albums. The encore of ""We Did It Again"" is wonderful."
4,review of the review,thanks for the review of the 520 yamaha. i'm looking at making a purchase and this was helpful.
3,Now that a couple of months have passed...,"I reviewed this cd about two months ago, giving it three stars (now I give it 3.5 stars). It has grown on me a bit. I like that a cd can do that. Although I still feel this cd is just a bit flat, I have discovered the subtle energy that ""Light Fantastic"" exudes. Track #5 saves the cd for me. It takes a couple of minutes for this 11 minute tune to get kicking, but this rhythmically charged tune is energizing, and is good for doing things like painting or house chores. Too bad it's only 11 minutes long. Actually, the rhythm to this tune fades well before the song is over, and runs (without a break in between, as with most of this cd) into the final 16 minute and 48 second piece ""The Luminous Return"", a very mellowing soundscape of suspended chords. I can see why some would consider this their favorite ambient cd with it's beautiful chords and techno rhythms, especially if you are new to this type of music. But this is not my favorite Steve Roach release."
3,The cover tells all,"Although there are some good moments on this c.d., I don't consider this one of his better releases. This is contemplative ambient techno, but is somewhat reserved, and gives the c.d. an overall flat feel. Steve's usual texture and soundscape is a backdrop for a slightly trip hop sound, but otherwise there isn't much new, if you are a Steve Roach fan. The opening track is the most trip hop, mechanical sounding piece of the c.d. The final, at almost 17 minutes, is an extremely calming soundscape piece, and you're mind will probaly be in alpha state after listening to this entire last track."
2,Pen???,This is not a toy. It is an over priced pen that is just regular black ink and a bit uncomfortable to use.
1,Gimme a break,"YUK...I just don't see it! Of course everyone has their own opinion and in my humble opinion, if you want some blues/rock, stick with Dave Hole (Short Fuse Blues)or Johnny Winter (Third Degree). They make this guy look like Barry Manilow."
4,Works great,I bought this because my husband lost mine. It works perfectly in my car stereo. I use to listen to Pandora from my phone. The only problem I had was that I couldn't connect the cable to my cell phone because of the case. My husband solved it by shaving off a little of the plastic from one end so now it works great.
2,"It works, but it's very flaky",I bought this for my car stereo aux input. It works but the connectors at both ends are rather large and if I bump either them or the cable then I get loud static pops from the stereo. Other cables don't have this problem.
3,Thin Wire,"Wire was thin. Thin enough where it makes me think it might be affecting the sound quality of my car's sound system when I'm playing music from my iPod. It was inexpensive, so maybe this isn't a huge deal... you get what you pay for."
4,Cheap and works,"I have owned this cable for about a year. I use them in my car to connect my phone to my stereo. They feel like they wouldn't last, but it has already outlasted my 9 dollar cable I bought a couple of years back. I plan to continue to buy these cables as I need replacements."
2,Poor connection,I bought this to hook up my ipod to my car. The connection wasn't sturdy so if the wire moved at all (which tends to happen in a moving car) the speakers on one side would go out. It wasn't consistently the right or left speakers. The cable would most likely work fine for a stationary at-home stereo but not in a car. I returned mine but am still waiting on a refund.
1,Broken cable,This looked like a good deal but it didn't work. I checked the cable with an Ohm-meter and there was no connection on the ground lead (sleeve).I wish I didn't waste a few days waiting for this cable - now I have to order something better.
1,Staticy and overly sensitive to motion,"I bought this for use in my car, but taking a turn in the car (mind you, I wasn't going fast around the turn at all) caused the cable to lose its connection and I'd get static. To get it to work at all I had to jiggle the connection on either end to get clear sound, but again, any time I took any sort of turn in my car and the static would return. Based on the positive reviews I would guess I was just given a dud. I liked the price, but I had to return it since it didn't consistently work."
5,aux cable,cable worked perfectly. i needed for a new car i bought. i play my ipod through my car stereo system. It functioned without an issue. Shipment was fast. I would highly recommend the product.
4,Adequate,"I bought several 3.5mm male-to-male stereo jacks. This was the longest one I purchased, and most convenient. It seemed to do everything it should: namely, it exported sound from my laptop through a 6.5mm jack to an amp. The sound quality was never great, but it was tolerable for a product that cost me so little. The shipping was not as fast as I had hoped for (nearly 10 business days), but then again I ordered it over a holiday.Bottom line, if you aren't in any hurry and you are just looking for a functional 3.5mm male-to-male stereo jack, this is a good way to spend $2.00."
2,almost ok...,"For how far up the rubber molding goes, it doesn't quite reach the detent using the jack in my car stereo. If not touched, I still get proper stereo sound, but it will fall right out with a light touch."
1,Doesn't work with all my devices,"For some reason, this works with the Satellite Radio unit in my car, but not with my iPod Touch. I haven't experienced this with any other cables.The cord is a bit stiff and thick (don't expect anything flexible and thin like ipod earbuds), but this is common for cheap wires.I've had lots of experience with cheap cables like this, and I wouldn't recommend using it if you intend to bend the wire a lot, especially near the plugs.UPDATE:I tried this together with other devices and didn't have any luck, so I've lowered its score. At least it works with one of my devices."
1,Did not function,"This product did not function in my car radio--the connection is loose and one channel comes and goes. Perhaps the plug diameter is out of spec. The company sent me a replacement, which had the same problem. A previous duplicate product, perhaps from the same company, failed after a few months. Other standard stateside products work fine. This one was cheap, but useless."
3,Short life span,"This product is okay. I bought it back in February, and have had shorting issues recently, to where it has to be twisted into a specific spot in order to work. The item works in relation to what you pay. If you're only spending $2.50 on the thing, expect it to only last you a few months."
4,"works perfectly, actual cord a little thinner than expected","This item fits perfectly, works perfectly, the wire is a bit thinner than ones i've had in the past tho."
1,Terrible Quality - You get what you pay!,"I bought 2 of those and both are crap! Don't buy as it's not worth! Really cheap quality, I barely used them and in no time they became unusable due to noise caused by short circuit or broken cable!"
1,sucks,This item broke within 2 weeks of purchase. Extremely bad quality. The quality of the sound was also very staticy. Do not buy this product.
1,disapointed,"I bought this item because the price was so good, but I guess you get what you pay for. The cord took forever to arrive, about a month. Now that it finally arrived we got to use it to connect my wife's radio in her car. The connection cuts in and out. I can't be 100% sure but I think the wire is faulty. Should have just paid double at the local store and had this a month ago."
5,3.5 stereo cord,I bought this to lengthen my MP3 player connection in my vehicle. It works flawlessly. Now i can take the MP3 to my lap or armrest and then pick it up and look at it closely when i am able to make changes and not have to look down. It is made well and has worked for six months no issues.
5,Thanks!,"Worked just like I expected. Works great and I had it hooked up and running the same day, works great."
1,"after first use, it's not working","i received item 1 week late. it's maybe not seller fault but item is very week quality, very soft materiel and it doesn't transfer verbal part of songs only melody part. it's cheap product but not working so you are wasting your money basically."
1,"Poor quality cable, scratchy intermittent connection","Title says it all, the cable I received was poor quality with a scratchy, intermittent connection. Seems like the ends are either slightly undersized or the material is not conductive enough."
5,Cable,Dealt with alot of faulty aux cables. This one finally works and its got a thing so that its not out in the open making a giant mess. Cords pull in so you don't step on them or let them out for a cat to bite. Sound Quality is great
3,looks good,"I ordered this product so I can use my ipod in the rental cars that I get when I travel. I haven't traveled yet to check it out but the seller is bugging me for a review. The cable and ends look to be good quality and durable, not hard and stiff. I don't have anything around the house to plug it into to try out so functionally I don't know, that is why it is only 3 stars."
1,Piece of chine see crap.,"Wires were pinched ,no good had to throw it away. Don't buy.Waited 8weeks for price of crap to come from china .price of crap."
2,Jury is Still Out,"The device works well so far. However, after only using it three times there are crackles when the cable is bent one way or the other. As such, I don't expect it to last very long."
1,it is not a 3.5mm cord,it is just not. i cannot use it anywhere.i also had to wait for two months for it to arrive.
3,I'm not sure if the wire doesn't work...,"I tried to hook it up to the car I recently purchased, but couldn't get it to work. The car is a 1995 so the plug-in itself might not work. The shipping was free and it was only a couple bucks so it's worth a try."
1,junk,These thing will not work at all.I plug them in a the sound was super bad.I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Hummm,Did not work for the iPhone. I think the metal insert is not made to fit the standard 3.5 female socket.
1,Very Cheap,"The cable works, so I can't really return it. But it barley works. Lots of feedback noise along with the sound of your music. Do not buy! I bought 2 and they are going right in the trash!"
3,Average quality,"I use this to play music from my iPod in the car, and it works okay. In the 6-8 times I've used it, I've had to adjust the connection 2-3 times because the cable introduced some noise or caused the music to not be balanced between the left and right speakers. After some fiddling it works fine. Given the price, I suppose it's what one would expect. I would rather spend a little more money next time to purchase a better quality product."
1,"Do not but this, would not work for more than a week","Price of this cable has further dropped down after I bought this cable.This cable is clearly shorter than advertised, it is only 1.5 ft long. Sound quality of this cable is pretty average. It works with all of my apple products (ipods(nano of various generations), iphone, ipad). Have used it only for 3 days now. I will update the review after a couple of months (if this thing lasts that longer ;))Update:This wire stopped working after 1 week. After a week of use one morning when I connected my ipod I started getting funny sounds, then I used another cable to connect ipod and I could hear everything well (Phew, for a moment I thought my ipod broke :) )It is better to spend few more bucks on something that would live for more than a week"
1,blahh.,the delivery was really fast i got it the same week i ordered it. the problem is that it was too much static. i can bearly enjoy my music. i really dont recommend it.
2,This cable is not good,"I actually purchased by mistake. I didn't see that the length is just 2 feet. This is made of completely cheap material, produces lots of background hissing noise when I connect my mp3 player or phone. I already have a 6 feet 3.5 to 3.5 cable, that works fine with all of my gadgets. You can probably buy a better one if you keep looking."
2,Cheap and not the right size.,"The cord was not 2ft, it was maybe 16 inches at the most and very thin and flimsy. It was definitely not what I was expecting and took extremely long to ship. You get what you pay for."
1,This product was crap,"When I opened it, I realized one side of the 1/8th inch cable was shorter than the other. It didn't even fit into my ipod. This is the biggest waste of $3. But then again, it was $3.....don't buy from this crap company."
4,Virtually as good as expected,"The Clarks Sparta Fisherman sandal lives up to its graphic image, except for one criteria.The length of the fit is ideal, so is the width. But one other dimension equally important for comfort but not considered upon purchase is the mid-sole inner thickness or height from the arch to the top of the mid-foot. In other words, the circumference of the foot at the arch.In my case, the size 7M does not come with enough girth for my feet. They pinched. The simple solution is to stuff newspaper tightly into the sandal to stretch the leather. But it takes two days of continuous stretching.Now they are very comfy.Otherwise, no complaints. The Sparta has buttery soft leather and excellent cushioning. Of course, perfection would be to have half sizes and other color options, such as tan or camel."
4,Great toy for little chef's,Good variety of types of food -lots of fruits and vegetables. Fun for the kids to make different meals. Perfect when you get a kitchen or pots and pans or dishes.
5,"Deluxe Play Set, great quality, great value","We bought this playset for our kids (1 yr and 3 and 1/2) for Christmas. They have had a good time ""setting the table"" and cooking. We've been categorizing play food and organizing the set by color. The set has much more than I expected and the quality is great. Super value."
4,Gary Hill is the man!,"I saw Gary Hill at a show in LA and was blown away at his huge presence as well as the vulnerability in his songs. He's a big guy with a big heart, and this CD showcases his great voice and songs."
4,Long time comin' but it was worth it...,"Gary Hill is clearly an artist who has lived that of which he speaks. ""Damn Good Thing"" and ""Explain This To Me"" are songs born of the emotion that any listener who's experienced pain in his/her life can instantly relate to. The songwriting alone is vastly superior to the drivel heard on most commercial country stations today. It takes me back to a time when it was all about the song, not image or the repetious licks and production concepts heard on most Nashville recordings of the last two or thre decades. Gary's rich but slightly vulnerable baritone voice shines through the support group of some of the West Coast's finest sudio musicians, none the least of which are Albert Lee, Doug Livingston, James Cruce, Jerry Peterson and Howard Yearwood. I'd give this CD 5 stars, but I wait in eager anticipation for his next CD."
5,I love it iced!,I put 8 teabags in a 2 gallon glass container filled with water and leave in the refridgerator overnight.
5,Good Tea,Very benificial tea the pomegranate red tea and also very tasty.It is caffiene free so you can enjoy it anytime.Once you've had a cup you'll find yourself going back for another.Also great with REAL LOCAL HONEY.
1,overwhelming hibiscus flavor,"Although the front of the package describes this as ""rooibos"", this tea contains hibiscus, which completely overwhelms the rooibos. Ewww. I really DO NOT like hibiscus teas."
3,"Good, not best.","What Was Said to the Rose is another nice recording of Coleman Barks's translations of Rumi, but it's not as good, at least to my ear, as the Voice of Longing collection. The Western music behind the readings is good music but maybe not as sympathetic to the material as the South Asian music behind the Voice of Longing readings."
5,Colemans blooming rose,"Coleman Barks reciting Rumi's poetry and the accompaning music go well together. Even when Sir Coleman sings some parts he sounds appropo.Rumi's poetry can melt your heart, and no one does Rumi better than Sir Coleman Barks."
3,"As nice as Riedel, but just as overpriced.","I value a good wine glass. For Bordeaux these are a perfect shape and the smooth lip is ideal. However, I've bought no name wine glasses at Cost Plus that are ever bit as good, and a quarter of the price. I wanted to like these but in the end I was left unimpressed, just like when I've bought Riedel."
2,not so tickled,I didn't like the texture. It felt thick and sticky. The color looked dull on my lips.
5,Darling Pink Glazewear,"I used to sell Avon, and it was actually a customer of mine that recommended this color to me. I've never thought of pink as being my color. I absolutely loved this color and this product because the price was right most of the time. Most of the time you can find this item on sale.The only problem for me is that I am not used to lip stick of any kind and I sometime lick it off. But the color was really complimentary to most people that tried it."
1,not a big fan of avon,"I had never tried Avon before so I bought some products on amazon to see how they suit me since I'm very alergic to make up. Great price, not such great product, I guess I will stick to big name makeup brands"
3,OK,"First bore sight wasn't aligned properly and the laser struck the inside of the barrel before exiting the muzzle. The item was promptly replaced and the replacement worked as expected, until the batteries died after ten minutes. Ordered more batteries (more money for Amazon) and I hope to be able to finally use this item when they arrive. During the ten minutes it worked, I noticed that the laser was not particularly well focused. It appeared to be about the diameter of a golf ball at 25 yards, but you get what you pay for."
4,Pick Up The Pieces,"This mostly forgotten movie about a pair of drug-addicted paramedics - though it received some critical acclaim when initially released, it tanked miserably at the box office - was a venue for Bill Laswell to develop an artistic project, as his work was ultimately issued as music from and inspired by the film.The material flows as a cohesive package, with Lance Carter (d) and Nickey Skopelitis (g) bringing unique textures to the wide ranging styles; ambient soundscapes, world music, funk and hard rock. It remains a strong - but oftentimes forgotten - piece in the vast Laswell discography."
3,"Fair binoculars, terrible case","Binoculars are fair. Made in China stuff. Case is junk - thin plastic. I worry it will not hold up and may break, dropping and damaging the binoculars. If you look through the binoculars just right they are very good but there is a dark spot that can mar the image. Not the quality I had hoped for $90."
3,Bushnell NatureView Plus (13-2000) Binocular,"This binocular has a nice tight feel. It is easy to focus, light in weight, and is very easy to adjust. The field of view is actually 441 feet at 1000 yards, not the advertised 330 yards. This was an error in the specifications as listed on the Amazon web site. Bushnell indicates that this model ( 13-2000 ) has a 441 feet @ 1000 yard field of view.The unit I initially received had a minor flaw on the interior coating of one of the objective lenses. Apparently there is some room for improvement with Bushnell's quality control program.I am waiting for a replacement of this same model, so I would say that overall I am pleased with the unit."
5,Great Binoculars!,"I love them! We just built a new house for retirement which is situated overlooking a large pond. Daily, there is always something ""happening"" on the pond. Have these binoculars readily available to catch the activity as it happens!"
5,Great binocular,"We considered many brands and options before choosing Bushnell 8 x 42. We have used them extensively for sight seeing at the grand canyon and in our mountain cabin. We love them! Simple to adjust, light weight, and amazing clarity. I highly recommend....."
2,Not so Good,"I thought these were going to be ok, but they do not bring any detail to the distant object being viewed. I used these for just a little while and then bought a lighter and much less stiffer pair from Eagle. Love them (from Eagle), though. I guess these are ok for the beginner, but if you want to see detail, pass on them."
2,OK for the price but could be better made (not quality),"These are really priced nicely. They shipped well and arrived fast. My complaint is that the tablets are too soft. They will literally crumble in your mouth while you are trying to get a swallow of water to wash them down with. It possibly could be that my bottle had a leaky seal or something else but as I threw them away I did not want to spend money to replace them and find they are made this way intentionally. If they are usually hard and they ship me a bottle I will change my review. If you can find an equal at a similar price, go with the other."
2,Made me feel weird,"I read all of the reviews on amazon and other sites before deciding to buy these. Once I started taking them, i felt ""off."" I had trouble sleeping, which caused a little anxiety, and I also had a little bit of trouble breathing as well. I am not sure what kind of reaction I had to these pills, but it just made me physically feel weird. I had been taking one in the morning, but felt a little hazy, so i started taking them at night. I found that i had to take it right before I dozed off, or else I would have trouble sleeping. Did anyone else have this problem? I am always looking for ways to be a little healthier, but I don't think my body liked these pills very much."
4,where's the button? And a solution,"When this cable arrived there was no button familiar to Palm users to hotsync; I could not get it to work and was very frustrated. After some conversation with customer service, I did some exploring and discovered that I can initiate a hotsync from the PDA ... go to the main menu, go to hotsync screen and tap the hotsync graphic; it's actually an icon and will then initiate hotsync.No button needed.Dave K"
1,Cable not appropriate for Treo 650,"Rating it one star because the item as-is, does not work as advertised on a Treo 650.This cable (in a bag marked Palm Tungsten T5 USB [2-in-1] Cable) DOES fit my Treo 650, but it won't sync to my computer (yes, I know how to initiate a Hotsync on the Treo without a cable button!!!). Works as a quick charger, though.Eforcity tried to make this right and sent me another (identical) cable. Same problem: charge, but no sync. Examined their cable with a magnifying glass and noticed that the pin-out is different from my original sync cable. Taking a chance (since now I had 2 cables from seller), I pulled pins out to make their cable like my Treo's - it worked!!! Now it syncs as well as charges!!!"
2,Not for Palm T/X,"I ordered this charger/data cable for my neighbor who had lost their data cable for their PalmT/X. Didn't know you have to have the data cable with a sync button. They can charge their Palm with the cable, but without a sync button, the data cable is just a charger. The product description lists it as compatable with the PalmT/X (it did when I purchased it, otherwise I wouldn't have)but it shouldn't."
2,Iffy,"This product caught my attention because the new E2 needs 2 gadgets to charge and sync, while this does both in one. However, the connection is iffy (need to jiggle the wire to get it to connect correctly), and it shorted out my computer twice. I hope someone invents one that is dependable."
1,Does not work for mac,"This device does not work properly with OS X 10.4It is missing the sync button that comes on the OEMversion of this cable, which makes this thing useless.Atleast, it does work as a USB charger for the treo 650."
5,A book both an 11-month old and an adult love.,"Beautiful, bright colors make this a treat to look at. The flaps and pull tabs are simple and sturdy so that my 11-month old can use them (with a little help). Would make a great present."
2,cute but very flimsy,"Cute book and story but everything rips really easily. My toddler wasn't even trying to destroy the book but as he tried to lift the flaps, it tore so easily. Do not buy for readers under 4!"
3,"Can't live with it, can't live with out it........","Batter option then allot of gaming systems out there, Sleek; lots of good games; DVD movie playback however nice to have a built-in hard drive for faster access and less load on laser which tend to die fast due to continuous use; just matter of time; this one has only two controller ports. Memory card is relative expensive ($24 for a 8 mb card) and can't play most of the games without it so add this $24 into the price.The good thing is that PS2 Games are cheap and easily available then XBOX, fun for all age kids. just make sure that you have to buy another one after some time, laser WILL die soon!Wait for PS3 if you can."
1,"This is a piece of junk,","I purchased this slim PS2 console as a gift on May 5. The box was opened on 4th of July. It read the game disc OK. The next day, the PS2 console just stopped reading the disc. Tried 4 different brand new games, and none of them works. Tried music CDs and DVDs and none of them are read. It appearred that the disc is not spinning, and the unit produced hiss sound.E-mail Amazon with no solution because it was over 30 days. Have to contact Sony and waste money to send in for warranty service. What a waste of time and money."
3,my review of ps2,I have one of the first ps2s and its great and all but right now it won't 80% of my games! My friend has a 360 and i feel like my ps2 sucks compaired to it. IT has dropped 4 times from 3ft everytime. I bought it for [...]$ and the warranty is 4 years past. I feel like i got ripped off please tell me the new ones are of better quality!!!!!!!!!!!
1,lots of fun for everyone,"I was hesitant to buy yet another electronic toy, but his was well worth it!"
4,Great Book with Great Games,I would recommend this book even though there are references to items that are no longer in the professional version of Flash MX. I found the more complicated games were very well commented inside the fla's. In summary this is a good book with some minor niggles.
1,Dont buy this book!,I have only got to chapter three and have already found several errors which has made following the examples very frustrating. The book also refers to functions such as 'normal mode' which no longer exist in the latest version of the software.the support files on the website also do not correspond to the files mentioned in the book. I would advise people not to buy this book.
1,Way too many content errors - do not buy this book!,"Beginning with chapter one and continuing throughout the book there are numerous errors. The content appears to not be updated for Actionscript 2.0 and Flash MX 2004 - even though the title says it is for Flash MX 2004. If you are a game designer (or wanna be) this book probably has some redeeming quality however, if your intent is to gain a more thorough understanding of basic Actionscript 2 and FLASH MX 2004, then this book fails miserably. You will have a very frustrating and disappointing experience. This book needed way more testing and proofing than it received before its publication."
1,this book is plain awful.,"I bought this book, because I am very excited and eager to learn about ActionSctipting in Flash MX 2004. As others have noted, all of the references and examples in this book are based upon the interface of Flash MX. Aside from that very bad, misleading point -- this book has ZERO personality. The pages drudge on and on with points that have no supporting explanation or examples. I have busted out into out-loud laughter at how poorly this book is written. If this book had a voice, it would be the voice of Ben Stein as the teacher in Faris Beuler's Day Off. Avoid this book like the plague. There are several other books out there that are much more helpful.(incidentally, this is the FIRST time I've ever panned a book on Amazon... I feel such incredible obligation, that I'm taking the time to do it now.)"
4,Great for Actionscript 2 starters,"I'm a designer and I tend to find the coding part a little boring... I wanted to buy a book to help me learn how to code games in flash. With this book you are able to learn actionscript in a fun way, simply because you make games! The explanations easy to understand, with lots tips and tricks along the way. A good book if you want to really get into actionscripting with probably the best overview of basic programming principles. Overall an interesting book, BUT more for those starting off in Actionscript"
4,Great book for learning the basics of programming,"Hi, This book explains the concept of Object oriented programming in a very simple way. My only slight disappointment is that a few of the examples are old ones that have not been udpated from the MX version."
3,Same performance as Intel cooler,"Quality is excellent, low noise for a high performance cooler. Low profile, will fit in most tight cases. Yes it makes more noise than the standard Intel cooler. Cooling performance is adequate if you want something that looks cool or are running at stock clock speeds. Buy something else if you overclock...Much better bang for your buck with the Arctic Cooling Freezer 7 Pro for around $20. Only difference is it is pretty big over the Silent 775D Dropped my temps by 10 deg C over this Thermaltake cooler."
1,Not worth it,"This is the loudest ""silent"" fan I've every heard. If you have absolutely nothing running on the computer, sure, it's dead quiet. But if you open a browser window, or anything that uses CPU cycles, it begins whirring up a racket that's ridiculous to hear.I'm returning it to the store."
4,A nice mix of Contemporary Jazz and New Age!!,"Bill Cornish listed a posting on the Live365.com Jazz community forum requesting airplay for his new CD. I was one of the curious inquirers to take the trip to his website to see what it was all about. I was very impressed by a few tracks on his latest effort, ""Horizons"" and decided to give it a review.The first words out of my mouth upon listening to the CD's first track, ""Precis"" was, ""Kitaro"". It sounded like Cornish garnered the new age legend's influence on the track. ""Days of Summer"" is another great recording. ""Days"" sounds like a mix of Shakatak and Paul Hardcastle all rolled into one. Very smooth and not too acid jazzy! ""Scatterbrain"" reminds me of Bob James' early 70's releases. This is a CD chock full of many New Age and Contemporary Jazz sounds that I think you'll enjoy. It's a very fine piece of work!!"
4,Djam Karet - 'Suspension & Displacement' (Cuneiform),"About as good as their other CD that I've recently added to my collection - 'Collaborator' {see my review}. Maybe it's just me but 'Suspension & Displacement' seems to be a bit more guitar oriented. No complaint there. Tunes I dug the most were the Robert Fripp-like ""Dark Clouds, No Rain"", their good guitar-layered composition ""Erosion"" (maybe the disc's best cut), the almost Pink Floyd-ish ""Severed Moon"" and ""Gordon's Basement"". Really like the way Djam Karet fully employs fuzz-drone guitar, ambient textures and intricate New Age keyboard work into their music. If you want to experience the 'real' alternative sounds available out there, go to the band's My Space. You won't regret it."
1,Did not work. Too much noise.,I bought 2 of these. Neither of them worked. One of them didn't work at all. And the other one produced so much static that a phone conversation was not possible. I wound up using a standard phone line splitter and an old 2-Wire DSL filter. I will throw these away. I don't normally write reviews. But these devices caused so much frustration that I felt obligated to warn others. My experience may be atypical. But I am concerned that the defenct rate may be high if the 2 DSL splitters I received don't work.
5,DSL Splitter with noise filter,This is exactly what I was looking for at the local stores and unable to find. It arrived within 3-4 days of my order. It has been working great since I installed it.
3,"Good quality, but the contents was not adquently filled.","I bought two cute packs with each of them labelled .25oz(about 7g). One is full, another not full, and the volume is at most third fourths (3/4), maybe 3/5. On top of that, the tag on the bottom of small jars are worn-out and not tidy. I was wondering if the jar might comes from sort of recycle system without totally cleaning. I hope there is some meticulousness or professionalism in the upcoming deals, which is the most important to me, and to everyone, I bet."
1,lancome absolue premieum Promo,"When I received two of these, they were the samples given at store purchase that clearly state ""not for sale"" and they were not sealed. I didn't feel they were the real thing as they were both more watered down. Than after using for a week I started having bad reaction to it and my eyes were burning like never before. I didn't think about the eye cream being responsible so I stopped using it and my eyes stopped burning. I'm very upset as this was a danger to my eye sight. All for a few dollars?Please do not try to save a few dollars at the cost of your precious eye sight. It is not worth it. Be very careful."
4,"Would it be trite to say ""Super Series?""","Since the production of ""Lois and Clark"" in the mid-90's many forget how far computer generated graphics have come and how almost every TV uses them seamlessly. Watching the show again it was amazing to see how well the producers did with the FX on TV's notoriously low budgets. Hey, it's Superman, the FX have to be done right.Something I had forgotten was how well Teri Hatcher did as Lois Lane and watching how her Lois and Clark came together.The discs look and sound great on my 60"" home theater system. I highly recommend the series, especially the H.G. Wells episodes, for anyone looking to spend some quality time being entertained."
5,cool,Just got done watching the first five episodes and I am enjoying the blast from my childhood. I remember telling myself when I was younger that I would own the series one day and now that I do I am satisfied.
2,Poor service can be expensive,"I loved the series and the DVD's I received are great, but the key words here are ""recieved"". I ordered the entire series and only received seasons 1-3. I got reimbursed for less than the 4th season was worth and had to order the 4th season separately. Unfortunately, by the time you figured in shipping and the additional cost of the 4th season, it would have been cheaper to order the entire series from someone else. Order with care from Amazon providers is all I can say."
4,Entertaining stuff,"The series is just plain good fun, harmless for kids and can be watched by the family, a worthy continuation of the Superman legacy."
4,Brings back old memories...,"I used to watch this back in the day. I absolutely loved the series, and watching the dvds made me realize how many episodes I haven't even seen! The only reason I give it 4 stars is the quality of the dvds really is from back in the day. The quality isn't as vibrant as it could be, really obvious with an HDTV."
1,What in the world is Amazon THINKING????,"Sure, the retail price for the four CDs together is $240 so $180 sounds like a good value. Except that Amazon is selling the first three CDs at $30 apiece and the fourth at $41 which only adds up to $131. Why in the world would someone pay an extra $50 just to buy all four at once?The CDs themselves are great - no problem there. I just think someone in the Amazon marketing division went a little wonky with this pricing and no one has caught it.Seriously - save yourself some dough. Until the price for all four CDs drops below the cost of buying them separately this is NO bargain."
1,What a RIPOFF!,DO NOT BUY THIS BOX SET!!! You can get all four seasons for less than $100 (as of January 2013) if you purchase them individually!
5,Great Show,I Been a Superman fan for many years and when this show came out they could'nt have done a better job perfect cast.
4,Learned alot - yet still questions,This book opened my eyes to a different side of adotpion that I had not considered. As most I looked at adoption as givng a child a home he would not have otherwise been able to experience. This book showed me that there is much more to this process and those adopting need assistance in helping the child understand and to feel loved - in showing it - not saying it.I would be very intereted in knowing how this author has lived the last 10 years - has he truly opened his heart and accepted love when given - or is he still searching and still has fear that he will not be fulfilled.It was a very touching book for me.
2,Not what I hoped for,"Although Mr. Dodds raises many good points about international adoptions, many things went overlooked. I would have welcomed information about how he really felt about connecting to the ""German"" part in him that he had lost....rather than the same feelings so many adoptees have about not feeling ""connected."" The difference between his international adoption and a ""national"" adoption were not apparent to this reader (and adoptee), who lived in Europe for many years.Here again, I felt his writing was not as explanatory and much was missing. I walked away from the book not fully understanding what he had learned from his experiences"
3,Good except for nose strip adhesive,"Perhaps I'm too cheap and tried to use it too many times, but the aluminum nose strip came off, which rendered it useless. While it was intact, breathing was easy and my glasses didn't fog."
2,fluff,"The theory's sort of cute, albeit reductive, and I understand why Rosenfield wanted to use Freud for it -- but it's silly, the book, overall. It's neither great fiction nor great philosophy (let alone science). I found it entertaining, but if a book like this is really to succeed, it should also be enlightening. It is not."
4,best freud yet,"I PURCHASED THIS BOOK LAST WEEK AND HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO PULL MYSELF AWAY FROM IT. NOT THAT IVE WANTED TO. ITS BETTER AND MORE ENGROSSING THAN ""THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS"" AND IS EVEN MORE CHANGING THAN ""THE BASIC WRITINGS..."" IT SCREAMS ""BUY ME BUY ME""."
1,Misrepresentation of Music Therapy,This book is very misleading to the general public. Music Therapy is a professional field supported by real and documented research. IF you are looking for information about Music Therapy then save your money and look for books written by certified music therapy professionals who reference their material with accurate research.
2,fantastical mysteries,"I bought this book for the short story by Charlaine Harris. While I enjoyed her Sookie story, I was less than thrilled with the remaining stories. They fell much closer to the mystery genre than fantasy, and in many instances this was the author's first foray into the world of fantasy, and it just didn't work."
3,An excellent collection of fantastical murder mysteries,"I bought this book with one particular author in mind, Anne Bishop. However I found several other stories in the anthology to be very interesting. It was especially nice because I had never read anything from any of the other authors and yet now, I became interested in what other works they may have. I haven't even finished all of the stories, so there may be other winners in there. Since that is the danger of an anthology, like a albumn where you buy it for one song, in this case a story, I was pleased to find that I had not wasted my money."
3,I've Read Better,I bought this because it had the story by Charlaine Harris. I was not especially impressed with any of the stories.
3,Pretty good....,"The stories were all just ok, except the Charlaine Harris one which was great, as always. I bought it specifically for her story but some of the others were pretty cool too. Worth a read, for sure."
5,Book Review,"I LOVE Charlaine Harris. This book was a good buy, and Charlaine's short story in it is amazing."
5,This is the model that all CEO's should follow.,"I had been a customer of Ms. Simon's company for almost twenty years before meeting her and working with her company. I love being self-employed, but after visiting her company, Sounds True, I found the company that I would love working within. Ms. Simon has created more than the world's greatest repository of spiritual and inspirational resources. She has evolved a corporate and business model that IS inspirational and spiritual. I continue to interact with many levels of her staff and have found Ms. Simon's ""spirit"" of achievement, honesty, and integrity represented by all that work within her organization. Although I do not work for Sounds True, I might as well. For I continue learning and growing personally from each project because I am exposed to her inspiration and influence. She has truly created the model by which all CEO's should follow and benefit."
4,This Group Rocks,"I heard about this band a couple years ago and went everywhere to find the cds. I found the 1991 release of ""Return to Zero"" and ""Lost"". Both are amazing, ecspecially ""Return to Zero"". I know Boston just came out with a new cd, ""Corporate America""... but I feel that RTZ should reunite and continue writing, everyone deserves to hear the talent on these CD's. If you're into the sounds of Boston you'll dig Return to Zero."
3,Track listing,1. Ripple2. My Bright Tomorrow3. Kagerou4. Rokugatsu no Tenshi5. Maebure6. Coincidence7. This Island Earth8. Are You Receiving Me? (remix)9. Good Time10. The April Fools
4,ok ... not so reasonable.,"Reasonable is in the eye of the beholder. Or maybe the house and diet of the beholder. Mate's vision is idealistic and stirred my soul, but it would be hard to actually follow the dictates of the book as closely as necessary to effect world change. Still, inspirational."
2,"Whine, Whine, Whine","For so fortunate a man, he has a dark side. I donated it to the library so maybe it will be liked by someone."
1,total waste of money and time,"Ferenc Mate is the most negative person I ever read. There is a message to his title but the book is nothing but one long, boring bitch session with little or no practical information."
3,Might change your perspective a little,"This may not be the most profound book I've ever read, but in it's simplistic, idealistic way it makes you want to believe that we can achieve a more humane existence. We have grown so far from the individualistic people we once were into a mass that works for the ""company"". Or at least most people do. Just give it a read, it may open your eyes to some things."
4,A real blast from the past! Nostalgia from accross the pond!,It realy takes me back. In the 80s we all danced and sang to these classic banging british band songs
4,So CUTE....but runs small,The shoe is a show stopper! The only problem is that it is 1/2 size too small. Too bad I am a size 10....back to the store they go.
4,"A great collection of some classic ""pirate"" themes.","This CD takes you back to the era of the true swashbuckler. From Errol Flynn to Captain Hook, the essence of the high seas is captured in these selections. The level of performance is adequate but the true value of this CD is the wonderful themes chosen for this project."
2,Not what I expected,"As a big Uriah Heep fan, I was looking forward to this CD, particularly given the high praise that many people gave it. Unfortunately, I did not find it to meet those expectations."
5,Authentic,Terrific and very authentically stylized performances of vintage songs from The Gilded Age and early Tin Pan Alley (plus a couple Foster). I was originally looking for a good recording of Bird In A Gilded Cage for American Music class and I think I found it. Very pretty voice but not overdone like you sometimes typically hear from many of the big opera stars. My wife also wants the dress on the cover!
3,"OK, but missing adapter","The pen is OK in and of itself (you need a lot of patience to find points if you're not familiar with them). I gave 3 stars because the adapter was missing from the box. Box was sealed and brand new, not opened. Maybe it's optional? If so it should be clarified better. Not a big deal, just very annoying. Would be nice to have had it."
2,Performance art,"Realize that this lasts only 30 minutes, so $5 would be a more reasonable price. It is in English, with English subtitles. It is more an oratorio than opera: there is neither meaningful staging, acting, or costumes. An even more accurate description would be performance art. The singers really aren't reflecting individual emotions, but simply relating a tale. It's interesting, but not an opera."
5,The joy and intimacy of pure love is expressed here.,"John Boswell and his music are a gift to our time. His exquisite ability to interpret and express life through his music touches my heart and soul. I have all of hia albums and just listened to this latest release ""Love"". I am playing it constantly. What a winner! It has the potential to live on indefinitely, along with the works of our great composers of the past."
1,"Get high, get drunk.","Get high, get drunk, but do not listen to this music in a suicidal mood. Make love, make fun and when it's done ask for help with the clean up."
2,Noisy! So much static and buzz.,"This cable has been working to get the job done (connecting my guitar amp to my computer) but it has so much buzz. A nicer cable sounds much better and was worth the extra $10. No $2 cable will sound good, it's bottom of the barrel from the whole world!"
2,YAWN,"Sucher's book purports to talk of a woman's coming of age and how her Jewish origins and the family's experiences in the Holocaust contributes to her development. However, the book does not relate her growing up with experiences of being in a family still trying to come to terms and accept what happened in WWII. The Holocaust does not in anyway seem to play a contributing factor in the protaganist's growth. Instead, it details growing up pangs which is nothing different or significant from a person in any other ethnic or cultural group. Ursula Hegi is a good person to read on what it was like to grow up German in the aftermath of war. I was hoping Sucher would be a corresponding Jewish author who could tell the other side of the story, but the book was a major disappointment. Boring, predictable, and doesn't live up to its promise."

3,My least favorite,"I read a couple of reviews that said this was Djam sounding hard like Metallica. I thought hmmm... a instrumental Metallica-ish CD. I hadn't heard any Djam before. I was diappointed. It's not instrumental Metallica. I'd just call it hard rock instrumental. Unfortunately, the guitar is kind of shrill getting in the way. There are some good tracks on it. I have since got a couple other Djam CDs. Burning The Hard City is my least favorite Djam CD. Get the other Djam CDs. Then get this one."
1,disappointed,"I purchased this cd because of its final cut, and learned about the song from a nautical-themed website broadcast. While the quality of the recording and the artists are fine, the only nautically-themed song was the last one on the cd, the rest being, for the most part, reggae/country mixture I didn't like."
5,New Moon Writing has the right stuff,"This is another great book in the New Moon book series. It lets girls know that writing is fun, can help people deal with problems, and can be a career. This broad based approach means there something in this book for every girl. If you know a girl who likes to write or likes to read, this is the book for her."
5,The band in their prime...,"This King Biscuit Flower Hour event was recorded when the band was riding high on the coat-tails of Shuttered Room, and they had just recorded Reach the Beach (but before it was released). Simply put, the sound and performance of this concert is so close to studio quality it's spooky - the band is in top form here, with fantastic material from their first two albums. Even casual fans will enjoy this cd."
5,LOVE THIS PEN,I am a nurse in a very busy ED and have had multipul hand surgeries it is painful to say the least to write at times this pen has given me back the ease of writing all over againthank you so much.Just one draw back do not I repeat do not let anyone play with the pen again the device breaks easily when put in the write mode it retracts very easily after it is broken
2,Really saves wear and tear on your hand,"Having a very bad hand, these pens are perfect for me. But the ones I bought on line seem to be much more cheaply made than the ones I bought at a local store. They fell apart from being carried in my purse. I do, however, love the colors.If you can find these in stores, I think they are better but the overall design of the pens makes writing much more comfortable."
1,Misleading waste,"The above item was ordered and upon review it is clearly worthless and without merit. I have read the book and expected more than a cut and past of content that in many cases does not reflect the authors' most salient's concepts.I recommend, based on other comments found on your website regarding other ebooks of this nature, that you seriously consider not offering material of this nature. It is only hurting your reputation."
1,A waster of money,"If you read the book review and the table of contents of Execution, you will have garnered as much information as this leaflet provides. The leaflet asks such provocative questions as 'explain examples given in the book.' Save your $4.00 and buy a latte at Starbucks."
5,Perfect for Any Chesney Fan,"I bought this as a gift for my niece and she tells me she is enjoying it. She went to see Chesney in concert in Atlanta and following her trip, I purchased this CD for her. I think all Chesney fans would be happy with the CD."
4,Nice Collection of Kenny's Earlier Work,"This cd is old; it came out in 2000 before ""No Shoes, No Shirt ..."" and ""When the Sun Goes Down"" were released. Both of those cds have propelled Kenny into pop-country stardom and some fans many be unaware of the songs on Kenny's first few albums.Since this cd highlights Kenny's earlier work, many of his newer fans may be unfamiliar with the songs on the ""Greatest Hits."" This cd is great for the fans who want a sample of pre-2000 Kenny without having to buy all of his early albums. My favorite songs are ""Back Where I Come From"" and ""She Think's My Tractor's Sexy."""
3,"If you're a fan, why do u need his greatest hits?","I am a huge fan of all music, and do not like the idea of greatest hits albums. It takes away from the artists intentions when creating the original albums (i.e. the wall, born to run, ashes to ashes, etc.) So when my girlfriend got me into K.C., i tried to get the albums instead of going for the greatest hits. However, I realized I could have saved a lot of money and hours of sifting thru mostly mediocre music by getting this album right away. Especially if you plan on seeing him in concert, this with his two later albums no shoes..., and .. sun goes down, is ""all you need to know."" By listening to all the albums, I probably respect K.C. more as an artist, but that being said, it will only prepare you for let down live w/o owning this one."
5,great collection of Chesney songs,"Absolute wonderful collection of Chesney songs--won't dissapoint you.""You Had Me From Hello"" ws the highlight for me but they are all good."
4,I love it!!,I didn't have anything of his and I wanted something new so I tried it. I was NOT disappointed!!
4,Great collection of songs from Kenny,"Often overlooked in the mid-to-late '90's, Kenny Chesney is finally cashing in big on his past and current successes. My only prob with this CD is I love ""Grandpa Told Me So"" and it isn't on here. Oh well, can't always get whatcha want! But every other song on this lengthy CD is worthy of the title GREATEST HITS. Go, Kenny!"
3,John Deere Rides Again,"My brother-in-law, Wayne Schmick, is a John Deere tractor nut. I also have a soft spot in my heart for those 2-cylinder puffers. Wayne is also good at & appreciates restoring things, like tractors, buggies, hay rakes, etc. Anyway, when I saw Chesney on ""60 Minutes"" he mentioned one of his best selling CDs had a tune called ""She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy"" which I figured Wayne would love. It took me a couple months to find the darn thing, but it was worth the wait."
2,Mediocracy Amid Good Song Writing,"Amid good to great song writing, the voice of Kenny Chesney can be overheard. Chesney obviously has a talent to pick better songs than he is able to sing. The talent in the songs far exceed the talent of the singer. He should keep up his ""Thinks Me Tractor's Sexy"" mode and forget the rest. I can't even believe this compilation is called his greatest hits. It should be called my new album with my hits added on. Two thumbs down for the singer who is unable to impress me with his mediocre talent. I would give the songwriters two thumbs up, but they allowed him to sing their material. Sorry guys, I took this album to the pawn shop."
1,bit impressed,I was hoping for a lot better....do not appreciate all the new songs on a greatest hits cd....seems the record co. is trying to dupe me...do not like that
5,Greatest Hits for Sure,"This cd is very good. Not only does it have some of the really good older songs, it has some great new ones as well. Kenny can go from ""She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy"" to ""You Had Me From Hello"" and it is all good!"
5,Meet Me Halfway,"Absolutely amazing! Javan's poems are short and sweet and straight to the point. I found this book at a time that I didn't think anyone knew how I was feeling, but after reading this book, I found that I wasn't alone. I have suggested this book to many people and will continue doing so."
5,Insightful,"This book is one of the most poetic, insightful writings I've encountered. Looking for just the right thing to say to someone close to you, friend or lover? This is the book that will definitely say it better than you can.I'm surprised this book is not better known. Read it and be enlightened!"
5,Most unusual McFarlane sports figure to date,"This has to be the most unorthodox McFarlane sports figure to date - that of a broadcaster and his pet dog. But that's exactly one of the reasons I like this toy so much. It's so unique of a toy and I'm glad McFarlane went out of his way to create him as part of this line, and not just another Wayne Gretzky. The detail on Don Cherry is impeccable, including a great likeness and ""thumbs up"" sign. Blue, the dog, is sculpted well, too. Overall, I would highly recommend this toy!"
5,"Hands down, the best book on Acrobat","I create PDF multimedia presentations and I own every book available on Acrobat 5.0+. Master Class is by far the best reference I own in terms of practical information.If you're creating complex forms or trying to master Javascript, you'll need Padova and Deubert, too. But if you're looking for ideas on how to create presentations that blow people away, this is the book to buy."
5,One of the Best!,"I have to concur with the NY reviewer who said this is a manual that all others should aspire to. How to's and examples are often presented in multiple forms to aid in understanding. The illustrations are clean, clear, and exremely helpful. The writing is concise, clear, and actually fun to read! The included CD presents wonderful examples of state-of-the art pdfs. While hardly a geek, I found myself reading the book before bed at night simply because it was so interesting! Kudos to the authors! I highly recommend this book not only to anyone wishing to learn everything worth knowing about Acrobat but also to anyone who aspires to write a similar text. It's a master class in information presentation as well as how to produce pdf's."
5,Better buy than the OEM,"The charger works as well as the one that you can buy from the manufacturer, but for much, much less. It fit the phone and the cigarette lighter perfectly."
3,A Stitch in Time Saves?,"I heard Wren Ross speak philosophically about life and I saw her knitting. She is really wonderful on both accounts. Her book makes a connection between the two which is more like a personal memoir than true connectivity. Beyond enjoying a look into her own psyche, I found it boring."
4,"Dr. Who, The Key to Time","Being partial to the Tom Baker years, and even though some of the props may be cheezie, Dr Who always tends to be entertaining and good viewing."
4,Great to see a classic Who,"The Key to time is one of my favorites in Tom Baker stint as the Doctor. Mary Tamm proved that she was up to the task as a companion and as a actress it was a shame that she didn't continue in the role. The whole Key to Time Series is a complete season and this a great positive, for I wish that all the seasons were sold in this manner, especially the Peter Davidson due to story arcs and continuity. Out of them all the The Ribos operation and the Stones of Blood are my favorites. The Power of Kroll is the weakest of the stories, but Tom in is usual way makes up for it. I was looking for a something different in the special features maybe music from the episodes, but that was not to be. Now I am waiting on the E-Space trilogy which dispite the Adraic character is also one of my favs."
1,TERRIBLE,"The game sucks! The book sucks! I am highly dissapointed in both of these products. I gave the game away, and I threw the book away. I think I'll just watch the shows and give up playing these useless wrestling games."
3,Pretty to look at,"Very Pretty sitting on the counter. I haven't used it yet. Like others I too have difficulty open the drawer where the knives are kept. Once I opened up the secret stash I found the knives to be OK. They seem lighter to what I am use to perhaps I'll leave them in their hidden compartment or give them away. I am pleased with the cutting board though.I will hand wash immediately after use. Wood should not be allowed to soak as it soaks up the water and expands. Please take note of this or you'll need a hammer to get to those knives. The Update: I now use this cutting board almost exclusively, I found that the height makes it easier to removed chopped veggies I have a square plate that sit lower and adjacent to it I just push everything onto the plate and whisk it to the stove. And it is pretty enough to be left out on the counter. The knives are still in the compartment and I am going to need some mineral oil to maintain it."
5,Lovely!,"I bought this set for $15 and after having received this cutting board set I wished I had ordered many more! I conditioned the bamboo with Mahoney's Walnut utility oil followed by his oil wax finish which conditions and protects beautifully and are non-toxic unlike mineral oil. The small knife is sharper than the large knife in my set, but both are well balanced and strong."
4,love this set,I have always wanted knives like this. they make cooking and prep a pure pleasure. the cutting board is very attractive also. I highly recommend them.
5,Worth the money,"I got 3 of these boards and never regretted. The quality of the knifes is very good. They are sharp and have good grip. The board is nice, smooth and heavy so it doesn't move while cutting. Good value for money"
3,knives,"I loved the sturdy cutting board, and how the knives fit very nicely in a small drawer beneath.The cutting board is light weight, and cleaning it is easy.On the negative side, I was disappointed as the knives dulled in a few short weeks."
4,great space saver,"the cutting board is pretty nice, but teh knives look really good. we got this as a gift for my family's cabin.... as space is an issue, a cutting board that kills 2 birds is great! the knives seem pretty high quality and are nice sizes for different use!"
5,Pinzon Santoku Knives and Bamboo Cutting Board Set,"The bamboo cutting board was much larger than I had expected and very high quality, as were the two knives in the order and both were well made and very sharp. The price was one I could not resist in buying since one knife was well worth the price alone, overall an unbeatable price."
3,Adequate but not stellar,"Nice product, cutting board lacks visual interest...it is just a block of wood, not smooth, had to sand the edges to remove spinters before we could use it. Knives were light in weight for the size. Prefer a heavier weighted knife.The unique feature of having the knives in a drawer in the cutting board is excellent. Drawer slides well. If the quality of the materials were a little better this product would receive 5 stars from us."
3,not bad,"Bulky, Knives drawer is difficult to pull, but the knives are great especially the handling. My wife commented positevly on this product!!!"
3,Good knives...board is aaah.,The two knives fit in the drawer. The board came a bit pocked and easily ingrains knife marks. Easy to clean. Nice luster after mineral oil. But lifespan is probably short. I wouldn't recommend putting any meat or fish on this unless you want bacteria to grow in the grooves or pock marks. I use it for cutting vegetables which I cook thoroughly.
4,Excellent Choice,"This was a great purchase for Christmas! We have used the knives for about a year now and they are doing great. Very good product for the price. The slide out drawer tends to get stuck and needs WD-40 to keep it loose. That's my only complaint. But other than that, I would recommend this product to anyone."
4,My Favorite Knives,"I love these knives. They are very sharp and a good size. I had been worried that they would be too slick, too hard to grip if my hands were wet, but this hasn't been a problem at all. I don't really care for the board itself; I have another bamboo board that is much better. This one is more of a laminate feel than ""real"" material. The nice thing about the board is the storage drawer for the knives. Each cut-out has a magnet inside to keep the knives from rattling around. Overall I am pleased with this purchase. I picked it up from the gold box one day for about $15, but I would still be happy had I paid Amazon's regular price of $30."
2,Not impressive in workmanship,"I was impressed by the look of Pinzon Santoku knives, but other than looks there is nothing more to these knives. They are flimsy on holding, and does not cut well either."
3,Did I get a used one or is this how they are actually made?,"I ordered this as a gift for my brother but I checked it before giving it to him to see if I should get one for myself. I'm really glad I did because he would have thought I 'regifted' it to him. There are several deep scratches across the entire surface and it looks used. I don't have time to order a replacement but I have to clean and sand this one before I can give it as a gift.The knives are fine and the wood is solid. Its possible it isn't actually used, just mishandled in packaging. If it didn't need repairing, I would have given it 5 stars. I hope this review actually gets back to the manufacturer so this problem gets fixed."

5,Excellent Home GYM,"I have been using this for primarily Bench press and Squat for quite sometime.I have been able to bench press at 180lb and squat at 200 lb.I needed a spotter/support while doing reps with heavier weight, this fits the bill perfectly.Till now it has not given me any issues, though I think this can only hold weight upto 300 lb(My guess) and that may be the only cons.Assembly was easy, and does not take up a lot of space.I have other home gym (free weights and bowflex xp) which use for other workouts.Good investment for home gym."
5,Magz: An 11 Year Olds Review,"Magz are awesome! Even though I am 11, I still enjoy to make the biggest pyramid I can possibly build. I also enjoy making 'traps', for small 'persons'. My brother (age 6) also enjoys using them, usually in his Scooby Doo games. I think as long as you have an imagination, and it has not rotted, you will enjoy using Magz sets, whether you are 3 or 99. So if you are wondering about if you should buy a Magz set, don't wonder any more. Buy it!"
5,40K Speeder Stands,These magnets (when glued to the Landspeeder base) worked excellent! I screwed a philips screw into the bottom of my 40K Landspeeder and viola- the model never falls off of it's base. The same process can be applied to any model/miniature that sits on a small base precariously.
2,A shame this excellent guide will never be updated,"Just came back from Ecuador where I climbed four of the mountains included in this book. While the pictures and route descriptions were excellent, they are woefully out of date. For example, in the ten years since the book was published, they've built a cable from Quito to the start of the climb on Ruca Pichincha, making most of that chapter useless. Our guide showed us on the pictures which areas were no longer covered in snow/ice, where there was more danger of rockfall, etc. Unless you're an extremely experienced climber, you're risking your life if you depend on this book."
2,No me gusta,"This book attempts to review what you learned in spanish 1 and 2. If you did not take those courses, you will be lost. Even if you did take those courses, the lack of detail in their explanations makes for a lousy review.The one thing I did like about the book was the reading practice, which includes spanish literature from around the world."
1,Needs Red Skelton!,"My 2 sisters and I had this album the first Christmas after our dad died, and it has been something we talk about and laugh about every year since. While cleaning out my grandmother's attic, we found the original album stored there, and the first song my mom and I listened to was ""The Little Christmas Tree."" ""The Little Christmas Tree"" IS this album, and without it it is incomplete. I would not purchase the cd without the addition of that song. (...) Whatever the reason, the album is missing a very important part of the original."
4,i was thrilled to have finally found this!,"I am devastated that they took off ""The Littlist Christmas Tree"" from this album. It isn't Christmas to me without listening to my very scratched up album from long ago. I'm happy my sons will grow up with this as well. Please, if anyone of influence is reading this, bring back ""The Littlest Christmas Tree""!"
3,Where is the Little Christmas Tree?,"That was my favorite song as a little girl. Then it gets released on CD and they leave that song out. Very, very disappointing!"
4,Where's Red Skelton's Littlest Christmas Tree?,I would have rated this 5 stars if they just stuck with the original track listing from the 33 1/2 album. Reading the other reviews this record touched a lot of lives including my own. It's one of my strongest memories of spending Christmas at my Grandparents.Any ideas to the reason they altered thte CD from the original Record?It's 12/15/06 and only 10 days left!Merry Christmas all!
4,FINALLY FOUND IT!,"As I child I listened to the album. This is my FAVORITE Christmas album. I was so excited to find it on CD; however, disappointed that it doesn't have The Little Christmas Tree by Red Skelton."
4,I agree - where is The Littlest Christmas Tree?!,"(...)I ordered 4 copies without even reading the track listing, only to be so very disapointed not to find ""The littlest Christmas tree"" included. Even though the cold war is over, at this time in our Nation's history I feel the recording is still very appropriate. As a whole the CD was not a disapointment - but I still search for a recording of my favorite christmas narative."
3,Very Disappointed,"Very disappointed that the Littlest Christmas Tree performed by Red Skelton is not on this CD, which is the only reason I purchased it. I had the album when I was as young as the girl on the cover, infact my mother bought the this record because the little girl looked like me. We listen to that album every year until I left for college and now is so scratched we are unable to listen to it. PLEASE tell me how I can get a copy of The Littlest Christmas Tree performed by Red Skelton. I have this CD, just want the other too!!!!"
2,christmas record,I was disapointed with this CD. We had the record when I was a kid an I loved Red Skeltons Little Christmas Tree which was on the record but not of the CD. I bought it for that story.
3,I'm sooo confused...,"I, too, was brought up with this album. My version was from the early 50s. There was no Red Skelton on it. What happened to Grandfather Kringle and The Happy Wanderer? There are several songs on this album that were not there back in my day. I'm disappointed that I didn't find the original."
4,First christmas record for children,"I have been searching for this album for 7 years and now that I find it the one song that I wanted it for is not on it. I did go to the Red Skelton website and purchase the cassette of ""The Littlest Christmas Tree. I do agree that it is a ashame that his estate would want this taken off the record. Was it Sony who wouldn't pay his estate royalities for the use of this song? I feel that Red Skelton would not want this to have turned out this way. I am 40 years old and I can remember as a child listening to this album and that song still makes me cry. How special it is that so many share this one tiny piece of heaven!"
4,Where is the Littlest Christmas Tree?,"I am so upset...it took me years to find this album and it doesn't even have my favorite on it! Anyone have the Littlest Christmas Tree on tape who can make me a copy? It is a shame that some greedy person decided to take that off of this release....especially since the part they cut out was about ""giving to one another without greed""."
3,Happy & disappointed,"I have been looking for this CD/Album forever with no luck. I just thought of Amazon.com and tried it today to find the CD listed. My daughter loved this album as a child and she and I have both been searching for it for her two girls aged 4 and 1. It will mean a great deal to her to have it for her children. I am so disappointed that Red Skelton's ""The Littlest Christmas Tree"" is not included. I realize it may not be ""politically correct"" for today but it was special favourite on the old album."
3,Good CD but it's not the original,"I agree with all the previous reviews. I still have the album and LOVED it as a kid - I'm 33 now. I too tear up when I hear ""The Little Christmas Tree"" song that is no longer on the CD. I recommend getting the album but if it cannot be found, the CD is a second best."
2,First Christmas Record for Children,"I, too, grew up on this record, and still own the LP, complete with cover photography by Tom Yee. I have been looking for this album on CD for many years. When I found it, I ordered four copies, as gifts for my sibblings. When it arrived, however, I was extremely disappointed. Several of our favorite songs on the original Columbia Records recording are missing. In their place are songs by Doris Day and Mitch Miller. I am returning the CD's and will continue my search for an album that is not worn from years of pleasurable use."
2,The Littlest Christmas Tree Missing...boo hoo!,"I thought I was losing my mind when I received this CD and this story was not included! I thought, surely I remembered correctly that it was on the album I was thinking! I guess I should have read the reviews before ordering! That was the entire reason I ordered it, and I am disappointed!! I guess if I could find an actual record, I'd be better off. At least I didn't pay much for it!"
5,The next James Taylor?,"It wasn't until I read the credits on the inside flap of the album that I truly realized what a phenomenal talent Jake Armerding is. Nearly every instrumental part on nearly every track is done by the artist himself. Most impressive are the hauntingly mysterious violin and guitar on the title track, the fiddle tune in between track 4 and 5, and the layered mandolin, fiddle, and guitar tracks on ""Ithaca""... (and the hidden track is gorgeously performed by a virtually unknown artist). His singing voice is enchanting and the album's rich melodies and strong lyrics speak loudly of Armerding's budding star qualities. I strongly recommend ordering this CD..."
5,Best voice/musician I've seen in a long time,"I first saw Jake at Club Passim's in Cambridge almost two years ago, and while he was playing with three other established New England singer/songwriters, he blew all their doors off. He combines intelligent lyrics with beautifully intricate melodies and a voice that rivals JT's to create some of my favorite music. The only album I like better than Caged Bird is his new self-titled album in which he further extends his impressive range of talents. Buy this album, you'll be glad you did!"
1,Awful indeed.,"Here we're treated to a second season of ramblings from the paranoid narcissist Moore. I recommend purchasing the second season of The X-Files instead, because although it's also loaded with conspiracy theories, it's more based in fact than Moore's self-indulgent propaganda and also much more entertaining."
2,"Good News, Bad News...","First the good news: This book was unbiased, favoring neither the prosection nor the defense. Linedecker provides the reader with EVERY minor detail of the case without passing judgement, which, by the way, was exactly what I was looking for when I purchased the book.Now the bad news: Linedecker is a terrible writer! Have you ever written an essay or report and used the ""copy & paste"" method during the revision stage? Well, Linedecker often started his revisions, but forgot to delete the wording left over from the ""first draft"" stage. If this doesn't make any sense to you, consider these examples.""...a compromise that would ensure he was given a prison sentence [of from] 15 years to life.""""The money was split [the money] with his brother and Camacho.""Folks, these are only a few of the grammatical errors I found. Unless you are willing to overlook them, I would suggest steering clear of this one."
4,Good Blackberry Pearl Case,Pros: 1)The case its self is made with nice leather 2)It puts your blackberry to sleep 3)You can feel you blackberry vibrate.Cons: The belt clip on the back was only glued on. After 3 weeks of use the clip broke loose from the case. Now when I clip it to my belt I have to be carefully not to knock it off.
4,"A beautiful journey, however you choose to experience it","WAYFARER is a lovely album of soothing contemplative pieces played with the beauty and quiet passion I expect from Doan. It is not as varied in style as EIRE: ISLE OF THE SAINTS, and if you're not listening carefully, the songs will blend right into each other. Not that this is necessarily a handicap; I use this music for my Healing Touch work and for reading and journaling, all times when sudden changing of styles and tempos might be very distracting indeed.This album is Doan's story -- in music -- of his travels to sacred sites or ""thin places"" in the British Isles. If you have an hour to travel, you can take the journey yourself by reading the notes Doan provides with each song. Close your eyes to experience the song, then open them and read the notes once or twice. Then close them again and fly away."
2,"Some Good Points, But Not Many","This book by Harvard Business School contains some good points on how to deal with difficult people--or rather employees since this book is focused on the workplace environment only. It contains some decent information on how to manage conflict in the workplace. What the book lacks is a step-by-step approach on conflict resolution or dealing with difficult people. It is an unfocused collection of paragraphs that have little cohesion together. What I wanted from this book was an easy to follow guide toward dealing with difficult people, but after reading the book, I didn't really learn much about how to do it."
4,The only Jerome Moross/GWANGI option for now.....,"Yes, this IS a great CD, for a little taste of Jerome Moross music. However....the fantastic VALLEY OF GWANGI score really needs to have it's OWN CD! Why is the wonderful Gwangi soundtrack not available yet, in it's entirety?!?! I hope that someone out there, with the proper authority and/or connections, can make that happen! For those of you who would like to have the COMPLETE Gwangi score, unfortunately this is the only current (incomplete) option available....since 1969! In this day and age, with all of the rescored, remastered film music now available out there, one can only wonder WHY?! But still, anything is better than nothing."
4,A great toy with multiple possibilities,"At first I thought this toy was going to be a bust. However, once my son figured out all the combinations he could create, he was very excited with everything he built. I could definitely see him thinking and that's worth the money of any toy!"
4,Absorbs a wide range of ages,"As grandparents we try to have a variety of books and creative stretch toys around in addition to the inevitable whiffle balls. We started with the small Wedgit box and quickly wound up ordering the 35 piece set. Likely we'll expand on that. One can play by himself, or entice a larger cousin to contribute ideas.Given that most children's toys are primary colors of plastic, I do wish a wooden version of this toy --with colors for the different sizes-- existed. That's the only reason I didn't give it five stars."
5,Great for learning or a party!,"I first encountered Wedgits at an adult party. Tables of adults were fascinated by these toys! I recently purchased them for my children, neices and nephews. These toys can be used to build, to create designs, or to teach specific concepts. They even have a website for educators as well as a book that can be purchased describing the ways they can be used in the school environment. Great toy to inspire and promote higher order thinking skills for children of all ages!"
4,Unique!,"These are really great because no one else really has them...Yet. They are fairly expensive so hopefully the price will come down so we can add to our set. If you don't care about the price, get them! They are fun for the kids & you!"
1,Blood and guts are not poetic!,"If you liked ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"", you'll love this one for sure; but my own experience working at the ER has taught me that poetry doesn't mesh very well with blood, pain and imminent death situations. I'm glad Dr. Huyler found a way to channel his stress in a positive way, but his somewhat empty prose leaves me quite cold. If you're looking for some good, interesting and serious tales about hospital medicine I recommend you ""Extreme remedies"" by John Hejinian. In this, his one and only work of fiction, Dr. Hejinian writes a story that reflects the unadorned reality of this exciting but scary world, and even when the novel was first published more than 20 years ago, it's still actual."
2,A Little Disappointing,"I read this book from the perspective of a fellow physician who served her residency at an institution that prided itself on its trauma services. I think that the stories Dr. Huyler relates are common experiences of young doctors everywhere, and any of us could write a book about the patients and the politics we see. I recognized many of my patients and colleagues in these stories. I think most of the chapters were good starts, but most could have used more development. It brought back memories to me of a night on trauma call as an intern, on my parents 40th anniversary. An older couple came into our hospital, also celebrating their 40th anniversary. The husband had lost his way on the country roads surrounding the midwestern city where I trained. He was hit head on going the wrong way on a limited access road. Neither survived. I almost quit medicine that night, and I knew I certainly didn't want to do ER or trauma. The problem with this book is it seems to lack a soul."
1,Not very well-written,"Dr. Huyler has some interesting stories to tell, but his writing style is very awkward and hard to follow. It does not flow very well. The stories don't seem to have any real ending to them; it's as if he just stops in mid-story and doesn't finish the tale for us. Also there are strange bits of information added occasionally that have nothing to do with the actual story. I felt like he frequently stopped in mid-story, shifted gears, started to tell a completely different tale instead, then stopped that tale just as abruptly to return to the original story, which in turn was ended without being properly finished. It's as if he tries TOO hard to be intellectual or poetic, and the story suffers because of his failed attempts at intellectualism. Being a doctor does not necessarily make someone a good author.Again, the stories themselves were interesting; they simply were not told very well."
2,Deviate from the course,"I've read many books about ER, this one was the worst. The first half was good and funny, but the latter half seemed wasting my time and money. It talked very little about the scene at ER, but the thoughts of the authors. It's not a autobiography!!"
3,not too bad,"I would agree with the other reviewers, it is a nice chill cd. Good in it's own right and worth having. Not the same as the gotan project so don't expect that from this album."
3,Interesting but too short and incomplete.,"Fairly interesting introduction of various literary works of Ming dynasty to republican-era martial artists, which include short bios as well as fairly rare photographs. However the book seem too short and much less comprehensive than it could've been, concerning how vast the subject is. What could've been nice would be including selected direct translations of the various texts that was showcased.More disapointedly was the lack of attention paid to southern Chinese systems compared to the Northern/Internal systems. Only a mere 2 pages or so are given to Hung Gar's Lam Sai Wing, the only representation of the southern Chinese martial arts in the whole book."
3,Good looking but not practical.,The sword looks and draws great with nice speed however I would'nt reccomend swinging it like a traditional sword as the blades WILL FLY OUT of the handle. Great as a stabbing weapon though and a nice club while still sheathed.
1,Bad Medicine Cabinet,"I am sorry to say, I hate this cheap thing. It's plastic and poorly made. It is very inexpensive, so I should have known better, it's photo looks way better than the actual product. I was going to use it for a rental property, but it is not nice enough even for that. Costs too much return, so I will try to tag sale it for a dollar."
1,Way overpriced for what you get,"My wife and I were in the market for a medicine cabinet and thought that this particular one looked nice. It's simple looking and that's really our style, so we ordered it. When we got it it looked like a cheap piece of plastic with a $10 mirror attached to it. After some trouble, because the cheap back end is just a piece of formed plastic, I got it hung. After a couple weeks the magnet that was attached to the mirror end just fell off, and the hinge is starting to look weak. This product is a piece of junk. I would expect to find something like this on sale in a bargain store for $15 or less. If I would have known, I would have never paid what I did for this product."
5,Spirited performance of charming work,"This performance of Alexander's Feast is, in my opinion, exactly right for the work; beautiful, clear voices singing the solos with good diction, a lovely balance in the small chorus, and superb playing of appropriate instruments for the piece and for the period. The notes on the flyer are also excellent, presenting the background and intention of the work."
4,Great Book!,"I really liked this book, the storyline kept me interested. I would definitely like to read more from Shannon Greenland. I love how she made the characters in this story seem real, you got a real sense of what they were thinking and feeling."
5,the real thing,"This is the one to buy :my old pizelle iron from the early 70,s has been used for years without fail. this year it burned out and I replaced it with this product.this new iron has the same sturdy construction as the old school versions. it looks like it will last 30 + years like the old one did . DO NOT be fooled by the ""made in China-no stick versions you can run to the local mall and buy for 40.00 dollars ...they will not last...Anyone who has made pizelle before knows you don't need a no- stick coating as found on the newer models .Great Made In U.S.A productBill Schaefer"
1,Worse bits ever for wood work,"While the pilot point may sound good, the tear out on the ENTRY side is completely ridiculous. I expect some tear out on the exit, but for each and every hole to be tore up on entry is simply not acceptable."
3,Interesting historical novel,"First, I have to say, I am really impressed with the level of historical research that went into this book. I learned quite a lot about the late Roman Empire and the early Christian church. On the other hand, the characters could not have been flatter. The protagonist and his wife are paragons with no quirks or flaws. The plot seemed contrived, lots of red herrings and no real clues. If you like to try and solve the mystery yourself, don't bother, there isn't a hint until everything blows up in the end. Additionally, I found the frequent reference to an early novel in the series really annoying. I don't really have to read that book now, do I, because I already know too much about it."
1,Very poor quality,"I purchased this badge/ID holder for my 11 yr old son as a partof his Halloween costume. He may have showed it to about 10 peoplein the course of trick-or-treating.The snap that holds it closed, broke on about the 5th or 6th use.Don't waste your money."
3,Not quite what it looks like.,"The holder is a real nice one. However, they should have to put in large bold print that the badge is not included."
5,Should Be In ANY Fans Collection,This Is A Superb Collection Of WWF Music Ranging From 1985-1998 I Promise You That If You Buy This You Will Never Eeeeeeever Remove It From Your CD Player Again
5,Awesome flute and fife!,"If you love Irish flute, then you will enjoy listening to Skip Healy! Visit his web site to learn more about this talented Grammy-nominated musician at [...]"
4,Not bad for basically christian metal,"Let me prelude this by saying that I am an atheist. Big time. So I have no bias about this album or promoting whatever message it may contain. I saw this album in a Tower Records on a listening station. I skimmed through the songs not realizing that it was 'christian' metal & bought it that night. I didn't realize it was christian until I started reading the lyrics. It really doesn't bother me at all because the album itself is brutal metal. If you get past the religious theme of the lyrics or do what I do and take them as mythological, they do conjure up a feeling of medieval battle. I would easily see these guys doing a soundtrack of some sort for a Medieval Spawn movie or animation. The riffs are intense, the bass thick & heavy and the vocals are dark & foreboding. If you take some higher meaning from it, enjoy. If you're like me and enjoy good metal music, give these guys a shot, whatever your spiritual orientation may be."
3,Classic thrash meets numetal,"I first saw these guys play with Project 86... My first reaction was that they are damned talented and they know how to put on an entertaining show, but I have never really been into the screaming. Well, since this show, my friends have gotten really into The Showdown and I have to admit, this cd has really grown on me. The instrumentation is remeniscent of 80's/90's thrash metal like Metallica or Tourniquet. The singing features mostly screaming, which is admittedly not my favorite style, but the strength of the guitars (with tons of great metal riffs and solos) and drums (excellent double-kicking and blazing hands fills) take me back to that great show with Project 86 and I am quickly caught up in the intensity and authentic energy that is a stark reminder of what metal used to be... now that I think of it, this cd could easily pass as an unreleased early 90's Tourniquet album. If you miss the good old days of thrash metal, do yourself a favor and buy this cd."
5,A Pleasont Surprise for 2004,1. A Monument Encased In Ash 20/102. Hell Can't Stop Us Now 9/103. Epic: A Chorus Of Obliteration 9/104. From The Mouth Of Gath Comes Terror 100/10 (Josh of The Chariot appears and ripes off your ears w/his metallic assult)5. A Proclamation Of Evil's Fate 10/106. Dagon Undone ( The Reckoning) 1000/10 I love this song for one b/c it has Bruce off of LS and plus it gives the listener a treat to those who miss LS. HINT HINT HINT PEOPLE LIKE ME!!!!!7. Iscariot 10/108. Your Name Is Defeat 9/109. Your Name Is Victory 9/1010. Laid To Rest 9/10 A good way to end a cd. Yes folks metal is back and it smells really fresh!! Finally since AILD there is a band that can assult you w/there music not in words. A cool band that has tons of potentional. Check them out and Look to the skies b/c that is were this band is headin
4,"Excellent music, but ""not-the-best"" production.","The music on this CD is excellent and is worth purchasing (I am not going to go into details on this). The only beef I have with this album is that the production really isn't that great. Like, the production work on the guitars really isn't that bad, but the vocal mixing and the percussion mixing honestly stink. From mixing my own albums outside of the studio I can say that a lot of stuff recorded with half decent equipment came out better. The reason for bad production lies with their producer. I'm embarrassed because i used to remember who the producer was. But basically, he was a musician who didn't have a great track record in production. I would have also appreciated if there was a little more intensity in the album.Don't think I'm ragging on the album or being picky. I just think that production plays a big role in a record. Excellent band. Excellent music. I do suggestion you buy it!"
4,Great Table Great price,"This is a good table no matter what, but a great table for the price. It is sturdy, good looking and doesn't take too long to assemble on your own. The stools are actually very solid. I put felt stickers on the bottom of everything because of wood floors, but they will be just fine if you have carpet. The table itself had a small dent in it from shipping, but really not a big deal. Worth the buy."
5,Very good quality,"This is a very nice piece of furniture at a great price! I am thoroughly impressed with quality of the product, and would recommend to anyone who is looking for a table and 2 stools at a great price!"
4,Cute product!,"Although this product is extremely cute in concept and design. The fact that you can only write on the reverse side of the pattern, is a little off.. I like to write two sided letters, but the print is so bold, that you cant write on top of it without it looking really bad."
4,Sound track from the Big Country.,"I guess this CD is not the exact music from the movie. What sound track is an exact replica ????? I rated this CD 4 stars. It is well worth the price. I found it very enjoyable. Track 17, Blanco Canyon about as good as it gets. The scene where Ramon and Mcay ride through the canyon, music was excelent. Also the music score where Charles Bickford rides out alone and slowly his hands ride up to him was right on target. All in all, an excelent CD......."
3,Mixed emotions,"The Big Country is one of the best western films ever made, and the score is so perfect you can almost feel the horse galloping under you. This CD includes music from the film that was not on the original LP, which was a great addition. Unfortunately, the conductor took some liberties with some of the arrangements, adding measures that are not in the film, especially with the conclusion. There is also a trumpeter in the opening piece that sticks out like a sore thumb."
4,Family History,I was interested in learning more about my family history and their lives. The book is a little hard to follow but has lots of details that are very interesting.
2,Not original recordings,I found this to be a disappointment. It didn't sound as it did on the originals. Go buy original soundtracks instead of this one.The only reason that I give 2 stars instead of 1 is that they perform it really well but they don't stick to the mood and pace of the originals.
4,Very helpful info for a seeker,"Le Vert's book has given a wealth of information and caused me to see what an important role melatonin can play as I age. The hormonal fluxuations I've experienced so far have been periodically debilitating. After a search of the net, I've also found a source - iHerb - that is as effecient in its prices and delivery as Amazon is for books."
5,Nice Product,I bought this with an atomic clock to use in a gymnasium about a year ago. It works great. It has been hit by more than a few basketballs and still looks like new.
2,Not all that great,"The premise of the book, the characters, and the setting all have potential - but unfortunately, all fall flat. The author continually changes style, going from a conversational feel, then to a play-by-play, followed by documentary. The book is tedious to read and at times very confusing. The author will describe a sequence of events, and then rehash the same sequence of events from another character's point-of-view. I got annoyed with the book and only skimmed the last third - I was tired of reading it. There's nothing in the writing that makes you care about any of the characters. Save your money - there are better books in the genre."
4,"Good, light-hearted adventure","I first saw ""Moon Over Tao"" at a screening in Hollywood, with director Keita Amemiya present, and boy was it a good time. A fast-paced, exciting action film, with some darn cool fight scenes, and good performances from all its leads, particularly Yuko Moriyama of the Zeram series, Hiroshi Abe of Orochi the Eight-Headed Dragon, and Yukijiro Hotaru of the Zeram series and the 90s Gamera triolgy. The effects aren't perfect, but they're pretty cool."
3,Asian has usual,"The movie is average at best, i guess i am gonna sell that one to, i rather check out Versus"
3,Labeling misleading,"I bought this product because ""dragon's blood"" was on the dr Oz show and recommended. The only place on the bottle that mentions Dragon's blood is hand written on the label in red pen. So i'm not sure that it was the product that I really wanted. The lotion is nice enough."
3,Average 3D-Average underwater movie,"Well...I hate to rain on all the 5 star & 4 star reviews,but I just didn't think it was special.For one its pricey,the 3D is average,underwater scenes are ok,but again nothing breath taking. I normally get in moods and re-watch all my 3D movies,but i'm not sure i'll rewatch this one.B4 I come off like I didn't like it at all,let me say again...it was ok..nothing special.The color that you might be awe struck with(like Imax Under The Sea)was average also."
3,Ok product,I think this product is a bit overrated for the price. I was expecting lot more than what I got.
3,A movie for kids,it is ok but seems to go on and on about the same thing some of the 3d is goodthe movie is fair only there are better ones out there
4,Pretty Cool 3D Ocean Wonderland DVD,"This is a pretty cool 3D DVD following a turtle (also narrating) through the depths of the ocean. The visuals are good although a bit slow at times. Also, the 3D effects are good but the clarity is lacking.Still, overall, I'll say I like this DVD for its information and unique method of (turtle) narration and, of course, seeing (in 3D) the wonderful life in the ocean.FYI: Other (better) underwater 3D DVDs areIMAX: Deep Sea (Single-Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo)andIMAX: Under the Sea 3D (Single-Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo)."
2,Ocean Wonderland 3D,"I feel compel to write this review as this video is highly over rated and over priced. The 3D effects is about average, the narration is just about ok though slightly on the kiddy side and the colors are a total turn-off. Based on previous good reviews I has expected something like ""IMAX: Under the Sea"" but what a disappointment. You get the blueish-grayish tone most of the time with the only exception of a few night shots. I want to see an explosion of coral reef colors and be stunned visually (as claimed on the cover). Instead its no better and at times even worse than the normal underwater scenes we see in normal tv broadcasts. I certainly regretted buying this and you won't see me giving this a second viewing. Its now chucked in the ""to be avoided' corner of my hall cabinet. Unless they drop the price drastically, do yourself a favor and give this a miss."
2,Too much politics makes a bad movie,I love the photos but hate the politics after you've been sucked into the movie. I don't care to hear one sided reviews of why the human race is at fault for destruction of the coral reef. Do you really believe that what you say you believe is really real?
3,IMAX: Odean Wonderland,"Although the movie itself is not great ,or best 3D I've ever seen,it was good,and a very relaxing experience. I personly enjoyed it."
3,More of a Public Information Video than 3D,"The video started off pretty good with some good 3D effects during the opening credits. Robert Redford had very little input in the narration of the video and most of us were misled by the video information. Video could of been much better if it was not a documentary of how the damming of the Colorado River has hurting the benefits of the river and how ""Global Warming"" has had an effect on the Grand Canyon and the level of the river. I was hoping for a more fun video with more 3D. Disappointing :("
5,Cute,"Dropped it and it didn't break, pretty thickly made, solid thick colors, and pretty darn cute for a big fat cow on my range top. It even has bright red lips. Stylish for a cow!"
4,Wake UP!,"I figure most people have a general idea of the topic they are reading about. So I just do not get into the long review process. If you want to know if the book is well written and engaging, I will try to help. This book like any of the other books by Bill Sloan pertaining to WWII in the Pacific is really good. Just get it and enjoy. That simple."
5,Given Up For Dead,"""Given Up For Dead""Made the Navy look bad? Let's review. They abandoned those Marines, which is not an unusual deed for the Navy.After the betrayal at Wake Island, our Marines were left to fend for themselves at Guadalcanal. Ring any bells so far?The only time that the Navy showed any courage was at Okinawa. Guess what? My father was on Okinawa in the 6th Reconn. Company. Had they turned tail and ran, I would have haunted them for all eternity. So never ask my opinion of the Navy. The only heroic men in the Navy are the Corpsmen. They did, and still save Marines everyday.Other than that, the Navy is a floating taxi! I was in the 1/5 in Vietnam, and saw nothing to alter my opinion.Apparently, the ""backside"" of the Navy is its best position!"
5,great,the book was great i couldn't put it down. It is a true story of bravery heroism and survival.
2,Careful! This is not the same group as Delerium!,"I did a search for Delerium and the Amazon.com database gave me a combination of Delerium and Delirium. Do not be confused. If you are a fan of the trance and electronic sounds of Delerium, you will NOT find that in this cd. This cd is reminiscent of Cirque de Soleil without the inspiration--sort of a Smooth Jazz/synthesizer style in Italian. If you know what you are buying and are a fan of this group, I hope you'll enjoy it. It's not my style, so I can't really rate it higher than 2 stars."
2,Don't confuse the British Nirvana with the American band as well.,"To those who are actually knowledgeable about music, you know that this is the Italian progressive rock band and not the Bill Leeb project called ""Delerium"" (spelled differently than ""Delirium""). This album is mostly just a reworking of some of Delirium's past ""hits"". Disposable."
1,Bad purchase,The orginal hard back is a nice book with good presentation and maps. The copy I received is poorly presented and NO MAPS which are essential to the reading of the history. Copy I received looks like a ebook printout just bound. Chapters all run together The publisher doesn't even know who the author were (two not one!!!). AT $23 A VERY VERY BAD BUY not recommended in the paper back edition!!!!!
1,Does Not Work,"Despite generally bad reviews for this item, I nonetheless decided to give it a try with my RS800sd monitor. That was a mistake. It failed to work right out of the box. I tried it on two different computers and neither would recognize it. And before you ask, yes, I installed the driver correctly. 45 minutes on the phone with Polar support was of no help. I am very happy with my Polar monitor, but I was very disappointed in the quality of this item and am surprised that Polar would put their name on something as slipshod as this, especially at such a ridiculous price. I was able to locate a USB IRDA Bridge at an online retailer for 1/4 the price and it works just fine. I hope that this is not a sign of things to come from Polar."
2,Polar IR- USB interface,"I am using the interface with a Polar 610i monitor. The inferface worked fine for about 2 years, but now works intermittently. It will link with the watch sometimes, but will lose the link prior to downloading the exercise files. The monitor indicates the com link is working, but the pc sofware reports the link lost. The monitor works fine with my iPaq and its software so it is unlikely the monitor is to blame.I am now looking for another option."
4,Confidence found in reknitting,"I do a lot of mending, darning. I had fears of re-knitting. After having purchased this book, I have found my confidence in this art. Indeed, the title of the book speaks for itself. There is no better book when it comes to learning invisible re-knitting. I was glad to have found a seller who had no qualms about shipping it to me, in fact I am very grateful. I especially love the section on how and where to find yarns within the garment, for repairing knitwear. It is very difficult if not impossible to find the right yarns for the repairs, but this book has given me the answer. So, if anyone wants to learn re-knitting, look no further. I give it 4 stars because it did not come with the tools mentioned in the book. I had to substitute them with my own sewing/crochet tools. All in all, this is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it."
4,Better recording,"This 1999 recording of Do Re Mi is a better recording than the original Broadway Cast, but the music is about the same. The show was a fluffy thing built around Phil Silvers. Now the star is Nathan Lane. Different actors, different styles. Nathan Lane, of course, can sing. ""It's Legitimate"" is still a raucous number as it should be. One wonders, though, why shows like this are being revived."
3,Mike Pinder - Among the Stars,"Like many late Moody Blues albums, and like his first solo album, I was a bit disappointed at first. However, repeated play at elevated volume leads to a greater appreciation of this music. It is certainly worthwhile, especially if you are a Moody Blues fanatic like me! The group has never been the same since Mike departed. There are definitely transcendental moments on this album, and they are hard to find these days. His music is pure and direct. His values are ""right on"" and straight form the heart. I would certainly love to hear more from him!"
5,A must for fans of the old Moody Blues,"This album is a precious gift from Mike Pinder, reminding us of what's been missing from the Moody Blues since his departure: his amazing voice, harmonic sophistication, and socially/spiritually-conscious lyrics. Welcome back, Mike! More please!"
3,Kind of disappointing,"I thought this CD was quite disappointing, lyrically and musically. The lyrics were mostly weak and seemed to be missing something. In many songs the verses were repeated too frequently, three times at least, even though many of the cuts were quite short. One positive aspect was the vocals. Pinder's voice was strong and melodic and capable of handling the different arrangement styles. A few songs were okay, including the children's song ""When You're Sleeping."" Perhaps his children's CDs are worth a listen. ""Fantasy Flight"", ""Upside Down"" and the instrumental ""Waters Beneath the Bridge"" were the best cuts. Although not a really terrible CD I couldn't recommend most people buy it. It doesn't come close musically to his previous solo effort, which even with its sometimes ""weird"" lyrics contained good melodies and poetry. I hope he hasn't lost his touch after so long a period without recording."
2,Among the Stars,"I bought this LP directly from Mike Pinder's Internet site to fill my 1 missing slot of his 2 solo LP's. It is a signed copy. The record came in the mail with a warp on it's edge. It will track using a good cartridge, so that went well. Pinder has some close sounding but not actual Christian message in his music. I would not buy Pinder's music to gain a Biblical perspective of this life or eternal life which can only be found in the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.R. Thomas did 2 fantasy albums back in the mid-1970's. These are also fun make believe solo albums."
5,"BABS, ""A HAPPENING!!!""","This vhs is incredible!! I had the priviledge of seeing Barbra's Last concert in NY 2000 and she still holds up to what she was in 1967!! This tape shows her at her vocal ""topness"" Hopefully we can hope for another concert tour in the future? lol but GREAT VHS!!! can't wait for the dvd"
1,Fake,These aren't men's shoes. Miu Miu does not manufacture any men's footwear (nor any other men's product for that matter).
5,An amazing Poet,A few years ago a boyfriend bought me one of Javan's books as a gift. I have since collected them all. He is an amazing poet who captures emotions we feel everyday in his poetry. He is a must for any poetry collection.
3,Ok but boring and slow to progress,"I bought this and the Shroeder book at the same time. I was beginning cello but already had a music background. The exercises in this book are much more boring than the Shroeder series. In addition, it moves at such a slow pace that you are up to page 50 before you find anything that is remotely challenging -- even for a rank beginner to cello.I suppose this is probably a better series for individuals who have never been exposed to music so need practice reading notes but my sense is that you will get bored with this pretty quickly and want something with more ""meat"" to it."
1,The quality of the e-book is HORRIBLE,"Really disappointed with Amazon. Why let this horrible edition of the book be sold through its store?In some pages, you can't read the words, it seems someone print the book in a low-quality-ink.I ain't discussing the way the book was written neither the writer but the quality of the ebook only."
5,Gets you smilin and keeps you there....,"I had the pleasure of catching SLD ""live"" at their album release party. It was a gas! Great catchy tunes will keep you coming back for more. They are exceptional artists in their own minds.....and most other too. Check it out! 23 songs for 9 bucks! Its a steal at 39 cents each, 2 cents more than first class postage, and worth both! Keep em coming SLD!"
3,silverhead,"One of the original u.k garage, glitter bands, the band worked hard but never quite got the recognition they truly deserved.This album represents their early live set that was always tight and includes some good songs. Couldnt get radio airplay but great live band. Truly one of the uk bands that should have but didnt make it."
1,"Poor seal, poor fit, fogs instantly","I am regretting this purchase. The only good feature is the purge valve releases air to the side so it doesn't obscure your vision. Probably a good thing for shark visits.The mask is very wide and leaks through the top and sides. To get it to seal well, I had to really crank the strap tight. In that configuration, the glass presses uncomfortably against my forehead- intolerable! The nose piece is too small for my nose... AND No, I'm not the guy from that Roxanne movie!Just a horrible fit for a mask. I had two other people try it on, and they had the same problem. Is this supposed to be an Extra Large or seal against our wetsuit hoods?To compound the problem, the mask fogged within a few minutes of entering the water-- it started clean and dry.I say keep looking."
2,There is better out there.,I got this and to my dismay it is a smaller version of a bigger book that I already have. It has two translations one on each side. That is fine and all but the Greek translation is terrible. I am no Greek scholar but I have found so many flaws in the Greek that it becomes useless. The author just takes the same language for the most part of the KJV. So you will not learn anything about what a word really means. The Greek Majority Text Greek New Testament Interlinear is much better and worth the money if you are a serious student.
1,Fire Hazard,"The review is making me give this product at least 1 star, if I had my way, it would get none. Purchased this thru Amazon. It caught fire today. Do not buy, it is a fire hazard. There are alot of complaints on this and Cuisinart has not recalled these coffee pots. Had my husband not been in the kitchen when it happened, not telling what would have happened."
4,about coffeemaker,"Very good, dependable product. But beware of the advertisement it is misleading as it states it comes with a permanent filter which after receiving it, this statement is not true."
1,Poor performance,"I echo the points others have made about this brewer: it regularly clogs and creates a mess, you can't take it apart to clean it, the design makes it easy for the coffee to back-up into the water tank.Regularly creates a mess in the kitchen."
1,Dangerous catches fire,I purchased this 3 years ago and it was a great coffee maker...until it caught fire this morning. I'm so thankful my husband was in the kitchen when it happened! Do an internet search for cuisinart coffee maker fire and you will find others have had this happen to them too. Avoid this coffee maker!
1,great for 8 days,I was so excited to get this coffee maker. It lasted for 8 days and then died. I call Cuisinart to replace it and was given the run around and told to call Amazon as I had ordered it thru them. It was a holiday week and I had company coming in from out of town. This is our vacation home and shopping is very limited. It was the worst customer service I have experienced. Amazon was helpful but can only provide free shipping for the return. I purchased another brand of coffee maker from Amazon that cannot arrive in time for my guests visit. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CUISINART PRODUCT AGAIN! Unreliable and poor return policies.
3,Not bad but I wish i'd known,I bought this coffee maker because of the fact that it had a 12 cup capacity and it had a flip up top instead. I was dissapointed to find that the cups are only 4.5 oz. so this actually is only 54 oz or 9 - 6oz cups. It is also hard to fill with water as the reservoir is in the back and the opening is small. The pause and serve feature leaks each time I use it. The coffee it makes is pretty average. I really expected more for the money.
2,A Disappointment,"On the plus side: stylish, easy to program, relatively fast brewing.On the minus side: the valve on the ""pause and serve"" feature easily clogs with grounds, causing it to leak -- if you are making a full pot, you have to make the coffee weak (using fewer grounds) to avoid this problem. Also, you cannot pour a cup from a full carafe without spilling. Finally, the brew temperature is too low, and is not adjustable.I'll be looking for a replacement as soon as my budget allows."
1,Weak coffee!,"I've never written a bad product review before, but I'm so annoyed with the performance of this coffee maker I have to issue a warning. IF you're someone who's as addicted to rich strong coffee as I am, you simply can't get it from this machine. I think what's happened to coffee makers in general is that they all seem to think a VERY fast and VERY hot brew is what people want. Wrong!! No matter how much coffee I pile into it, WAY more than I ever had to use with my good ol' cheap simple Braun, the coffee is ridiculously weak and much too hot for my taste. Every coffee lover in my family agrees, we literally keep dumping cups of coffee down the sink in disgust. I'm giving it away and looking for another immediately. Because I neeeeed good coffee asap..."
4,Wow!,"This is truly a great album, especially amazing considering it is their first effort! Make sure to check out 'Cherry Lips' and '1000 Miles Away' for rockabilly heaven. If you haven't gotten to see them live, the album is a must until you can!"
5,These guys are hot!!,"I missed these guys so!! I have this album and bought it shortly after it debuted and still listen to it to this day. Cherry Lips is my absolute favorite on this album, but everything is so wonderful to listen to! I wished that I still lived over in the western part of Washington to catch their latest shows. Check out their website, www.thesouvenirs.com. Their latest single ""I'm Still Missing You"" is absolute heaven! You will not be disappointed!! Check them out!"
2,WHY OH WHY ??,"I did my research...and read about his fighting and training skills.I was very excited to be purchasing a MMA training dvd.Can I just say...its terrible!!!He uses children and young adults to demonstrate his moves...although great for my kids...as an adult...Im not interested in seeing young kids try out new moves.. and sloppily I might add (they need further correction)""A"" for effort to the kids..but it is like going to ""Bill's School of Karate"" around the block -where kids just move their body with no correction on form ..and the instructor takes their parents hard earned money...Im sure he is a very talented man..and he thought it best to use students in his class as examples..but unfortunately thats what makes this DVD terrible...hopefully the next one will show more precision...and no children."
5,Mr. Ames Strikes Again!!!,"Jonathan Ames is one of the great writers of our time and this book is just proof and proof again. There is no reason why David Sedaris is on the bestseller list and not Jonathan Ames.This book is a collection of essays, sort of a poor man's Curb Your Enthusiasm, or a poor man's Sex in the City.Buy this book as an introduction to the brilliantly sick mind of Jonathan Ames and then get the Extra Man by Jonathan Ames. By far his best novel.And the price, $14 for 250 pages! I really dont see how you could go wrong!"
1,buy other books,Not as entertaining and not as well documented as many of the other books available on Bush and his lies.
3,Japan Travel guide,"While this book was interesting, it was not essential. When traveling to Japan it is important to study their etiquette, however most good travel books do as well."
5,My favourite bhangra album,"After the break up of B21, i didn't have a favourite bhangra artist or group for a while. Juggy D has got it just right for me, r'n'b, hip hop and bhangra perfectly mixed.The best tracks have to be:SOHNIYEBILLODIL DE RANICOME ONEMERI JAANAnd the rest are very good too, the remixes add a new variety. An excellent debut album after featuring in other tracks with Rishi Rich and Jay sean. A must have for any bhangra fan's collection, great for parties and all other times, just the thing to get you in the mood to dance!!"
1,Over priced,I just bought this at the store like for 4 bucks. who ever is selling this is exploiting this big time.
5,Great Chipotles,"These are great for mexican meals. They are small cans, but have so many peppers in them you won't know how to use them all. We have a hard time finding these in the super market and this is a good deal around $2 a can. We eat a lot of mexican food and we still have half the case left after 4 months."
2,Village Records,The book didn't contain the information I was hoping it would. Basically $33.00 for nothing of value to me. I will try and research a book's content more before I purchase another one on just a couple of recommendations. I wish a table of contents had been available to review before I purchased the book. Live and learn.
3,Not always the main theme,Disappointment here is that you do not always get the main theme from the film - e.g. Godfather waltz.
5,Josefina Learns a Lesson,"!~Josefina learns A Lesson~!I am writing a book called Josefina Learns a Lesson. Its about a girl who likes to read. She likes to write about her family. She has two sisters and two nephews and a dad. She gos to school to learn how to read and write better. She likes to run outside and play with her nephews. She lives in Mexico. I recommend this book to people who like to read and write. The author is Valerie Tripp .The book is from American Girl Collection. Someother characters in the collection are Kirsten, Samantha, Addy, Molly, and Felicity. There are more characters."
4,Excelent basic books,This book put into easy to read wording that I could understand. I read it very quickly and enjoyed it. I feel a lot more educated and knowledgable about solar power systems.
3,good book for interface solar cells with auxilary equip,"good book for understanding specifying wiring, inverters, batteries, etc., but limited in regards to information about solar cells themselves--only about 2 pages out of 200 plus one page listing addresses and phone #'s of solar distributors."
2,Very Basic,"The picture is ok but not great. The sound isn't great at all. Of course there isn't much to expect from such a little box but the TV even sounds bad considering that. My laptop sounds better. The worse thing is the DVD functionality. I haven't really payed attention to it before buying, so now I am blessed with frustration:- Only plays DVDs. No VCD, SVCD or other video formats!- NTSC ONLY!!!!- Only plays region 0 and 1 DVDs and no hack available anywhereAs for audio cd playing I find it annoying that the drive is fairly loud and that the screen is always on. It's an ugly blue screen just displaing 'track 1', 'track 2' etc. - no CD text.My recommendation: If space wise any possible - get a TV only and an external DVD player."
2,"Fine for basic cable use, nothing more.","Owned this TV since 2007. Worked fine just for watching DVD's in the kids room. Son got older and tried connecting Uverse and it's just not easy to use. TV will not pick up that the Uverse cable is connected to the component (video 2) input and makes you go through the initial set up EVERY TIME YOU TURN IT ON. You must let it go through auto channel search OR you can stop it by pressing the ""Setup"" button, than press ""Select"" to get to the Video 2 input every time you turn the TV on. Extremely annoying and customer service says there is no fix for it.If you just want to plug in the cable to the cable input and nothing else, it works fine. Do not try to use the other inputs because you'll be setting up the TV every time you power it on.Worth getting a different TV and get a DVD player seperate."
2,"Sylvania 15"" HDTV","My wife purchased this TV for a limited space in the kitchen. To receive HDTV we have to rent a box from the cable company. The rental box is too large to fit into the remaining space in the kitchen, so when the switch-over to the new TV transmission takes place, this set will be obsolete."
2,In The Repair Shop,"I bought this ""Sylvania LD-155sl8 15"" LCD HDTV with Built-In-DVD Player"" on 9/10/07 and it arrived at my home on 9/13/07.I had it for 48 days and it stopped working, no picture, no sound, nothing.On 10/31/07, I shipped the Television ($40.00 shipping costs) to the nearest authorized ""FUNAI"" service center for repairs and it arrived to them on 11/1/07.The service center diagnosed the problem, a ""Main PC Board"" and the Service Center placed an order for the replacement part with FUNAI on 11/6/07.Today, I am still without the Television.I watched it for 48 days and the Television has been in the Service Center for 40 days waiting for a replacement part.I contacted the Corporate Office for help and nothing but, a bunch of excuses!I will not buy another FUNAI product, based on their lack of urgency to delivery parts to the Service Center."
2,NOT HD,The picture on this TV is definitely NOT HD quality. It is so poor that I thought the first one I got was defective and sent it back for another one. The picture quality of the replacement was equally disappointing.Amazon's service however was impeccable.
4,Grandkids TV,"Great TV for the price. Built-in DVD player is a real plus. I bought one for each grandkid and they love it. Picture quality isn't that of a SONY, but good enough for guest rooms and video games on a 15"" TV in this price range."
3,"Fair, but not the quality I expected.","I needed a new T.V. for my kitchen counter & I thought this one might fit the bill, but, when it arrived (on time) & was set up, I felt that something was missing. I was not in love with the picture, which seemed greenish to me. It was just not an enjoyable experience, so I ordered a Toshiba HD 19"" set it up in place of the Sylvania & I have been truly satisfied ever since (this was about 6 months ago). If fact, I was so pleased that I just had to write this comment to let others know how satisfied I was with the Toshiba. The Sylanvania is just sitting unused in my spare bedroom."
4,Romance NOT Horror!,"Everyone thought that Dario Argento would produce another horror movie when the news about this adaptation of Gaston Leroux's book first spread out. How wrong they were. And as ""Il Fantasma Dell'Opera"" is more a dark romantic tale than a series of splattering images, so the music by Ennio is suitably etherial, full of vibrant, warm colours. This is to class, though I admit that his work on Dario's ""Stendhal Syndrome"" was slightly better."
3,You don't need this book,"This book is not bad. The problem is that everything that teach you, you can learn it for free on the internet. If is the first contact with the language maybe is useful, it wasn't, so I can't tell.That's why you don't need this book if you have access to internet and who haven't. If you know how to program try the tutorial included in the standard distribution and then Mark Lutz's books.If you don't know about programming try How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python. Is an online book and a good one."
3,What happened,I ordered two of these dvds. One was stolen by either the UPS man or the person who picked it up and gave it to me (co-worker). Haven't found out who but in the future please wrap the envelope/package in packing tape so it will not be easy for someone to take the dvds out and re-seal them to look like it wasn't touched. The dvd played well which was a gift but I wanted one also. The thief stole mine!
1,Tripe,"Amateurish, went through the motions and had the all obligatory scenes of a good movie, but was shallow, generic, cliche, etc. just a ""cheap Chinese knock-off"" if you will. and the holier-than-thou attitude got so bad that by the end I was rooting for the Japanese general."

2,below average martial arts film / below average period fantasy,"Basically, this is a bad period film in the guise of a martial arts film. Has some decent fights, though there is too much wire work (although by that, i'm kinda of saying that there shouldn't be any wire work). The fights at the beginning are a lot better then the ones in the middle and end of the movie. The most interesting thing about the film is the great Fan Sui Wong is the role of the bandit Jin. He's clearly the most interesting fighter / actor to watch in the film. Otherwise, this movie starts out decent, but by the end of the film, you find yourself saying that the film is pretty bad. If you're looking for a great old-scholl martial arts movie, then this ain't it."
1,Just a bad movie...,"I had high hopes for IP Man. It quickly becomes evident that it is a cookie cutter, martial arts movie. The characters are one dimensional and there is little to no character development in the film. The setting is potentially interesting and then becomes a weak nationalist cartoon.The main character is, apparently, the best fighter who ever lived. IP Man has no real problems with any of his fights. I found myself wondering if IP Man would be challenged in some way and was sadly disappointed.If you like movies, do not bother watching this movie."
1,def product,The movie reviews on the dvd display/play ok. When the IP Man movie starts to pan foward it stops dead in its track. The display only shows IP Man moving foward and then stops. I went to Walmart and their movie did the exact same thing. I own a panasonic bd-65 and loaded w/latest firmware update 1.27. Defective product.
4,Entertaining,"Unlike its sequel (Ip Man 2), this film is pretty good, and not just for its amazing fight sequences. Although most of the Japanese are one-dimensional cardboard villains, it was refreshing to see some nuance to the main antagonist. The Chinese characters are thankfully given a little more depth, and Donnie Yen and cast deliver some decent acting between fights."
4,Excellent movie,"I bought this movie on iTunes without knowing what it was all about. But I have to say that I was happy once I did see it. Of course in all movies there are some things that are ""over-the-top"", and this movie had its share, but I love to watch it, and I will continue to do so because there is plenty of Wing Chun action."
5,WOW,IP MAN is the greatest kung fu film ive ever seeen and im not really a big fan of kung fu movies. If you have a kindle fire like myself then this is a must buy for your lovely device.
5,great movie,"One of the best martial arts movies of recent times. Donnie yen, who plays IP man really shows us something in this one. Spectacular action. There is also a sequel and a prequel which are both great also"
5,GREAT STORY,"This is the guy that taught Bruce Lee, so you. know he had to be one of the best in the world."
5,there is fighting and then there is Wing Chun,fighting is awesome and well executed. What makes this film brilliant though is that the characters really existed. I just can't wait until IP Man 2 comes out and moves to HK and includes the story of Bruce Lee
4,4 Stars for Ip Man!,"Though most of the movie is fictional, it does a great job representing Chinese Gung Fu, and the many variations of styles and philosophies, particularly Wing Chun Kung Fu."
5,Great martial arts film,IP man is one of the best martial arts films I have seen in a long time. It is right up there with the Bruce Lee collection and I can see where IP man style and techniques helped propel Bruce Lee to the kind of status that all fans of the martial arts can be proud of watching over and over again.
5,Ip Man - Blu-Ray Movie,I love the action and storyline of this movie which centers on the Teacher/Master of Bruce Lee. You will not be disappointed if you purchase it.
5,Great Martial Arts & Story,"This is a great movie. Beautifully made, fantastic martial art and a very interesting storyline (based on real life and historic events)."
5,A Donny Yen masterpiece,"Ip Man is about a real kung fu master (who trained Bruce Lee). It's about the Japanese suppression of China during the 30's. The fight scenes were terrific, Donny Yen (Ip Man) is an amazing master and actor. Characters in this film seem real. The fight scenes between Ip Man and the Japanese are terrific."
4,IP Man,"A thoroughly enjoyable and dramatic martial arts picture that avoids wild wire-work fighting (a la ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") and tries to maintain a feel of history and realism while still imbuing its subject with a bit of myth."
5,Kung Fu without the campiness!,"Centering around the actions of Master Ip before he trained the immortal Bruce Lee, Ip (played by Donnie Yen) plays the gentle soul yet so skilled is he that he is constantly challenged for the purpose of lesser characters trying to prove themselves. A terrific Kung-Fu movie for people who love the Kung-fu movies of old but without the campiness of the 70's style martial arts movies. A beautiful careful storyline as well as well-developed characters will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire time. So much so that you'll barely notice the subtitles. The characters and story telling mesh so well that the story is incredibly easy to follow. I absolutely love Wilson Yip's directing style and will definitely be looking for Ip Man 2."
5,Great Movie,I wasnt expecting much when I started this movie. It was a great surprise. Loved it and have watched it numerous times.
4,This Was Good,"I enjoyed this very much. The voices used were terrible. They sounded a little goofy, as was the movie in the beginning, but once the war started and Japan occupied, it was much better."
5,Who wants to read while watching a film?,"I'm surprised by the comments about dubbing. I really enjoy martial arts movies and I don't mind that their lips don't coinside with the spoke script. I love watching the fighting and would be very distracted if I had to keep reading the bottom of the screen. You can't really do both efficently, so I dont mind...rather appreciate the dubbing"
1,terrible,"This is a terrible movie with unbelievably bad writing. For example: a man wins a bag of rice in a fight, he asks to fight three more men at once and loses, and is then shot dead by a Japanese occupation officer when he goes to take his rice. The shooter is asked why he did it, and he says it was to teach him a lesson because the fighter lost but still took his rice. What lesson does a dead man learn?! The whole movie is full of non-sequiturs like this, deus-ex machina, and the story generally lacks reasoning and logic. There is no character development or background given to support anything that happens.The kung-fu is merely passable, the presentation non-biographical and unhistorical, and the English dubbing is painfully unfitting. Production values are otherwise good, but they're completely wasted on a nonsense script.There seems to be an astroturfing campaign to boost the ratings of Ip Man. Buyer beware."
1,bad blue ray dvd x 2,"Bought this blue ray dvd.It did not work.Id did not show the function choices at the bottom (such as..play movie,screen selection,special features etc..).It just froze.Could not play the dvd.Had to return it for another one and it did the same thing.Finally, I had to return it and got my money back.Never had the chance to watch the movie.I never had this problem before with other blue rays.One thing though,return was easy and painless.Just print the label,tape it to the dvd,take it to ups store and drop it off.No return fees.But it's pain in the a.. nevertheless."
3,Entertaining but....,"This review should only be noted for streaming video.Type: Martial Arts/psuedo-historical biographyStreaming quality: 5 starsDubbing (Chinese to English/Japanese subtitled): 4 starsAction: 5 starsRomance: 3 starsSetting: 5 starsRealism: 3 starsHistorical accuracy: 1 starRe-watchability: 2 starsPlot review: Chinese propaganda movie set between 1930-1940 of kung-fu legend Ip Man. Multiple hand to hand combat scenes that incease steadily in violence, escalating to broken limbs and brutal gun shot to the head. If you can get past the bad taste the blatant misinformation provided at the end of the movie leaves, you may enjoy a decent martial arts flick. Personally I won't buy this movie but I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching for free on my Prime account."
1,Solution to freezing menu,"Like many here, my blu-ray copy of IP Man freezes at the menu screen. For some blu-ray players you can get the disc to play at the frozen menu by pressing 000 on your remote and hitting enter. For other blu-ray players, press 001 and hit enter at the frozen menu. This is how I got my disc to play.The one star review is for the frozen men (people shouldn't have to figure out cryptic remote combinations to get their disc to work). Also, the one star is for the unskipable previews.The movie itself is five stars."
5,Ip Man,This is a great move. The beginning is a little cheesy but after that it gets really good. I would recommend this to anyone who likes martial arts.
4,Excellent,"A friend of mine highly recommended this movie. I'm not sure if it is the best kung fu movie ever made(which was his claim), but it makes my top 10. Yip Man was a great person as well as a great martial artist which this movie shows. I bought it without ever seeing it. Worth every penny."
5,Wow! Was that ever a great movie!,"I have become quite a fan of Chinese movies of late, as my wife is Chinese and most of our nights are spent watching Chinese films. I purchased this movie, as I do like martial arts films (as long as they are somewhat realistic, not really into seeing people fly through the air), but also I want a movie that has a good story and is made with some quality. I should also say that I was a student in Wing Chun (Wing Tsun) for a few years, and the fact that this movie is about one of the most famous of all in the Wing Chun genealogy (first teacher of Bruce Lee)did also spark my interest as well. What I got in watching this movie was everything that I mentioned......story, plot, history, action, quality...one of the best Chinese movies I have every seen! It is still three days after I viewed the film and I am still saying to my wife, ""Wow! Was that ever a great movie!"""
3,I love IP MAN character but film is not enough good,I love IP MAN character but film is not enough good.acting is good for this style moviecinematography is goodBUT...
4,excellent ku fung movie,"This is an excellent Ku Fung movie. I saw the Chinese version long ago.Recently I watched the Ip Man 2 (BluRay). The second one is very good as well.If you like Bruce Lee type of Ku Fung movies, you will enjoy Ip Man series.Noted that the latest Ip Man movie is about his early days (Ip Man is name of the Ku Fung master); it was first released to theater July 2010 in Asia."
4,Husband Loved It!!,"I am not a huge fan of Karate Movies, however I watched this movie twice already... Decent story line and the fight scenes were great... Definitely a guy movie though, my husband loves it."
5,Fantastic action movie,"This was a great movie. It has lots of action and the message of loyalty, discipline and strength was well displayed."
2,Instant download Ip Man,"Free and instant download. What's not to like? I saved it to watch while I was in the hospital, and then couldn't find it or how to download it. Frustrating at best."
1,IP Man dvd,"Returned first dvd because movie kept freezing after previews. Exchange for new dvd thru amazon was easy and convenient. Unfortunately 2nd dvd had same problem. Only then, did I notice upon going to Ip Man dvd webpage that the dvd doesn't work on Panasonic and Sylvania blue ray players - there is a notice. So I have no idea how the movie is, although it sounds great. So disappointed. Not sure if I can return opened second dvd."
3,Great movie -- but low quality DVD.,"The movie itself is wonderful. As usual Donnie Yen doesn't disappoint with his martial arts skills. The story, while not entirely accurate captures the essence of Ip Man and the wing chun system. Good showing with no complaints there.The bad part is the the DVD quality is grainy. It's still watchable, but the bad quality is noticeable straight away. There were other freezes in the DVD as well, only lasting for a moment. Then halfway through the DVD completely froze, and when I tried to skip forward or backward the film would skip the some random point.I'm having another disc sent to me as I write this. Hopefully this copy will not have the playback flaws. I'm sure though the grainyness will still be there though.This is one disc where it might be worth going blue ray."
5,Ip Man - Great movie,"Overal, great story line and action scenes. Donnie Yen delivers another great fight scene. I recommend it to any martial arts movie lovers."
4,a great film,This film with its iterpersonal drama and fight scenes is a good film to watch on a lacy Sunday afternoon.
5,Definately worth watching if you enjoy Martial Arts films,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! I really was expecting a dud. It's probably not something you'd drag your girlfriend or kids to see; however, if you like good martial arts movies, are a history buff, or just like good story telling...then check it out. It's definately worth the $ to see it."
4,Great movie- Screwedup Disc Authoring,"This is one of Donnie Yen's best films to date. The only other improvement would be Jet Lee in there too. Together they are phenominal. I first saw IP Man on DVD and very much enjoyed it. Donnie Yen does a superb job with the coreography and is very convincing. Also, I believe IP man was a very dedicated and humble man which I got from Donnies character. I purchased the Blue Ray version for nothing more than the HD. The picture in HD is great and clean with no hiccups like the DVD version- unless you upscaled it, otherwise horizontal bars and jaggys would appear. The picture is much more 3 dimensional than the DVD version as should be. However, I probably wouldn't expect it to start up without hitch unless you have a new blue ray player. My laptop blue ray player required an update before the movie would play. Having done that, I would recommend this title, especially if a fan of Donnie Yen."
5,What a MOVIE!!!,"If I could give this movie 10 stars I would!!! I was skeptical about this movie. But, when I saw if from the opening scene I could tell that it was special. The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. The story, (not sure if all of it was true) but the story was so engaging. The fight scenes were not too far out there like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Wires"". Instead, they were done very intensley and with great editing. The sound was great as well. Nothing too ""Black Belt Theater"" where everyone sounds like they are flapping their wings. The story was very well told. Drama wasn't too drawn out. You actually cared for the characters.I highly recommend this movie. Incredible. I've already seen it 3 times!!!"
1,Ip Man,"Sadly I didn't get to see the movies as it didn't work, I purchased both Ipman & Ipman2 with only Ipman 2 working.Thank You"
2,Not as Good as Iron Monkey or Chocolate,"Donnie Yen is superb in Iron Monkey. Yuen Wo Peng did the martial arts choreography for that film. When you do a martial arts film the film should be shot so that you see the full bodies of both, or most of the major combatants. Unfortunately Ip Man has way to many close ups. A foot kicking a knee is a bore, even if you know whose foot it is. Chocolate is also brilliantly shot. It's about a Thai girl kickboxer whose moves are incredible, and who does it all herself."
4,great!!!,it's been a long time since I've seen a really good kung-fu flick. this one is definitely worth checking out!
5,AMAZON MARTIAL ARTS,"An excellant Martial Arts movie! One of the best I have ever seen!I would highly recomend the movie to someone else, and already have!"
5,This is the version to get,"This is an excellent movie. Wing Chun practitioners will love it. Unlike the other versions, the subtitles are well done. The bonus material is good, too."
4,Excellent Action and sound characterizations,"Although I was ultimately disappointed to find out that much of what is displayed in this allegedly 'based on a true story' tale is not, I thoroughly enjoyed the action and emotions portrayed by the cast.What I enjoyed most as I reflect on the film is that our hero is the best fighter out there and, unlike Rocky or Clint Eastwood or so many other superhero movies, we are not made to suffer through implausible scenes of our guy getting his butt kicked before he gets his. Donnie Yen as IP MAN is always the man and his being so takes nothing away from the drama or entertainment value of the film. This movie, I purchased just on the recommendations expressed here and I was very pleased. I would agree that it is one of the best martial arts movies that I have ever seen.Those who see the sequel Ip Man 2 will see the filmmakers regretfully return to the tried and true format."
4,Outstanding martial arts,"This movie was outstanding; I can't believe I hadn't seen Donnie Yen before. There are a lot of negative comments regarding subtitles and dubbing--I would like to point out that on the BluRay version, there are options for Mandarin, Cantonese, and English (and maybe more, I can't remember), with subtitles. The quality is great--I believe the film becomes intentionally more monochromatic and grainy after the Japanese invasion. Understanding that this is a movie about a grandmaster, we expect embellishment with the fight scenes (things like people defying gravity and such), but it is kept to a minimum. Overall, an outstanding film. I would like to see Wing Chun in more movies rather than only the typical Northern styles."
2,Say what?,"While IP Man has decent action, it represents its story as true-ish (based on a real story) and it barely reflects the facts of his life. This movie is pure revisionist propaganda backed and funded by one of the worlds largest governments. Watch it for the fights and skip on the false drama. IP Man 2 is an even worse film."
5,Excellent,Very good movie. I won't bore you with philosophical details. Just watch and come to your own conclusions. Great action.
4,"Used on the Bellytwins ""Beyond Basic Dance"" video","I was looking for the music Veena and Neena used on their ""Beyond Basic Dance"" video, since they don't give any information on their DVD's or website :O( and found it was on this CD. The only problem is that a lot of the music sounds alike. If you can, listen to some samples first, or get it used."
5,A Historical Classic with Contemporary Relevance,"Gramsci's political theory stands as some of the most influential thought in the social sciences, both inside and outside the Marxist school. This edition of The Prison Notebooks has all of his most important work. Furthermore, the editors did an excellent job of informing the reader of the context which Gramsci was writing in, which is imperative for accurate conception of his ideals. The 60 page introduction by the editors does a tremendous job of placing Gramsci's work in the turbulent mess which was post-WWI Italy.As one can imagine, much of Gramsci's work is outdated, but his work on cultural-hegemony and ""common sense"" has never dwindled in relevance. Analyzing the forces that create and sustain political consciousness is not only the greatest contribution of Antonio Gramsci, but his analysis has much to tell the contemporary reader trying to understand why individuals act as they do in current political order."
4,"Today, the marxism is gramscism","I read this book, here in Brazil, some years ago.Please, I'm a complete anti-communist and I must tell that this the best marxist book, I ever saw.Why?Because in all places of the world, in the last thirty years, the left got victories, using ever Gramsci's ideas.No Marx's or Leninist original ideas sent left any power.Since 1979,in Nicaragua, there's no communist revolution, in any part of the world.Whithout a single shot, left imposed communist tyrannies in places such as Venezuela, Bolivia, Zimbabwe,etc.And left got Brazil, Argentina,Venezuela,etc. using Gramsci's ideas.Guevarism sent Che Guevara himself to defeat and a grave easily for Bolivia's army.Gramscism sent the bolivian Evo Morales to total power, with no risk and without a single shot.Gramsci showed to the left, during 1920 decade, how to get power, in nowadays.Today, the marxism is gramscism.Read this this book and see this fact."
4,Antonio Gramsci Was a Lunatic,"This book is pretty fat, and has a good chunk of meat under its cover; if you're into Italian history, as well as the history of the Italian Communist Party, but also Marxist philosophy and sociology from an Italian perspective, then this book is definitely for you. However, I still think Gramsci was a lunatic, and that you should take an anti-crazy pill before reading this book because this man's head was filled with too many jelly beans and he would sometimes vomit them out onto the pages which were all scribbled feverishly in a fascist dungeon in which he was imprisoned, hence the title. People, especially devoted Marxist communist party leaders, do not fare well in prison."
2,Herky-Jerky Existentialism is Old Hat and Worn Out,"This reminds me of early Joan Baez, ""There's a garbage can over in the corner and Daddy done come over and spit in it."" The lyrics are jerky written and sung. It reminds me of ""bad bluegrass' vocals of which there's little worse. Like so much bluegrass, the music is good, the singing mediocre (because of the lyrics and herky-jerky lines). There should be a SONG to carry the message, not just words falling on the floor."
5,""" Excellant from start to finish """,I love this CD. I listen to it at work when I need to escape to another place and another time. I'm looking forward to Bob's next project. Two thumbs up.
5,Fifth in series and still excellent,"This is the fifth cd of the sacred steel of the House of God churches. Musically, the Katie Johnson with the Campbell Brothers is a highlight of the album - she appears to be truly inspired by being live. Willie Eason's vocals and guitar with the Campbell Brothers is another masterpiece - vocals in a blues vein. For folk music, the cuts Hollering and Don't Let the Devil Ride are very informative.For a 5th time, the quality has been maintained. Enjoy."
4,Sacred Steel,"This album is worth buying. It is spiritually uplifting and has great harmony and melody. If you are looking for good christian music, this is a great buy."
3,Not outstanding in a field of gems.,"Similar to the Madaras books, with a copy each for girls and boys, but doesn't quite live up to the legacy. Includes transparent plastic overlays at several points to illustrate changes, but the overlays seem more like a gimmic than a useful tool. Generally good layout, with an attractive mix of pictures, text and interactive sections. Includes a small amount of information on STD's, AIDS and good/bad touching."
2,Return from the past.,"This CD interested me for about 2 days, I haven't listened to it since. Their music is just too simple and monotonous to me anymore. It doesn't sound like much time at all was spent on the production of this disc, although some of the mastering sounds pretty nice, I suppose with great equipment that is no problem. There is also some bad off time editing on track 13. I was in fact a large fan of Bass 305 back in the day, but I'm sorry to say, it doesn't seem as though David and Mark know what is going on anymore, nor really care. I hope to see them produce something of better quality in the future, there is a lot of potential for bass music right now, the timing is right. It bothers me to not see them taking it anywhere."
2,Cheaply made - Not wide enough - I wish I could return it!,"Just received the Lapinator and I find it flimsy and feels cheaply made. I paid $29.99 and I am guessing it was only a few dollars to make. The material used on bottom feels picky and is annoying when wearing shorts. I have a 15"" laptop and its not wide enough... yeah, yeah, I should have checked the dimensions, but I guess I was taken in and believed the pictures showing plenty of room - this is false and obviously photo-shopped! Being so narrow it is not comfortable... having to hold my knees together. My package also included the ""Mousitizer"" which is also cheap and small - not really strong enough to support your hand. I guess it's still better than no mouse pad at all. I wish I could get my money back and get something else! I gave it two stars because it was made in the USA - otherwise a zero! I wish we Americans will wake up and fight for more US products, but this one is a big disapointment! We need to do better!"
1,Shambolic and wafflesome,"Lured into its supposed merits, as espoused by the then single review on here, I looked forward to using this book in my work. Disappointment, however, was not far away. The book is wafflesome, and vacuous. How it claims to be useful for developers is mystifying -- an unjustified title if ever there was one. It is a useless reference source for this purpose. It is barely useful as a source of information for managers or analysts either. You've got to get past the waffle first, remember! Poor, poor, poor."
3,Eagerly anticipating the next album,"Baby Ray received a lot of press when I was living in Beantown and I purchased their first album Monkeypuzzle on the basis of that press and the description of their sound (XTC-esque, they said; they were correct). Pleasantly surprised, Monkeypuzzle now sits comfortably in my top ten list. Unfortunately, this EP is not up to the intensity of their debut. Only a few of the songs met my expectations, but it was worth the purchase for the bliss of ""Gossamer Riddle"", a joy that is one of their finest tunes. Hopefully, the next album will be more of the same."
4,A worthwhile read on the Mission Statement alone,"I thought the core of the book for me was in the first 2 chapters, where the author expressed the importance of a personal mission statement, writing about his own example as well. After that, I found the book a bit repetitious.Nevertheless, the mission statement section was a worthwhile read alone, if only to stress the importance of having one for your own personal life. Just like many corporations are starting to have a mission statement, individuals should have a life mission statement. Once this mission statement is determined and articulated, your actions and choices in life can be measured against it. Part of your journey though is to think about and determine your mission statement, a journey/process of self-determination which only you can undergo."
1,Derivative and Underwhelming,"The book appears at first glance potentially as unique insight into a wide variety of insights within the author's supposed personal journey.However, it becomes apparent quite early that it seems to be a series of random thoughts all pieced together. Many of these ideas are recycled and presnted as new ideas through his eyes.Pass it by, I returned mine."
3,The Glass House ????,The Glass house was interesting and definately gave the reader much to think about. This did not appeal to me but those in search of Big foot and other world wide myths might find this to their liking.
5,Australia Comes Alive,"If you have a hankering to travel to the land down under,this is the novel that will transport you there. Beautiful vivid descriptions, scenery that will take your breath away, characters that live and suspense that makes you shudder. Australian mythology abounds here. This book will appeal to romantics, adventurers, sci fi and mystery lovers alike. I can't recommend it highly enough."
1,Insipid Fairy Tale,"This book was an insipid fairy tale. The allegory was obvious and the language better suited to children. The idea of not taking responsibility for ones actions is repugnant to most Christians. Even followers of reincarnation, believe that each new incarnation is meant to atone for mistakes and habits of the immediate past life or a way of bettering one's soul until reaching nirvana or the Christian heaven. It is disturbing to think that this message is being sent to people who might be searching for spiritual solace for the first time. The best I can say about this book, is that it is an amusing little fairy tale with a scary message."
5,Food for the soul,"This is one of those rare books that speaks differently to each reader, yet speaks powerfully and beautifully to all. Everyone I have given this book to has loved it and passed it on to others. A great gift for anyone and any occasion, especially for yourself! Not yet found on many popular bookstore shelves so we are all fortunate to have found it here. I can not recommend this book highly enough"
3,Second Album,"This is the reissue of Dungeon's second album,Demolition being their first.One Step Beyond is their best album,I can't wait for their new album to come out called The Final Chapter."
5,Excellent Spa treatment,"I use this for a 350 gallon hot tub. I love the product. It feels good on skin, keeps hot tub looking great. My daughter gets rash from chlorinated hot tubs, have never had any problems with this system. I have been using EZ Spa OM with EZ spa shock for about 4 years and just love it."
3,A Fair Overall Reference on the American Bicycle.,"I found this bok helpful as an overview of the American bicycle industry but did not provide enough information for any era of the industry, and not too useful in identifying various makes or manufactures. Book lacks the span and depth that I was looking for, much of which is easily found on th internet now days."
3,Not what I had hope for,"I opened the package and was impressed with the globes -- a very nice color and texture (more to a dark ivory, and less so of an amber color, imo). And the globes seemed relatively substantial.But the fixture itself was cheap-looking & light-weight. And the color was metallic-like, more of a copper or a red-brown, but certainly not dark brown.I'm not sure where Amazon gets its list prices. An item like this sells for ten to fifteen dollars any day of the week at Menards. I returned it."
4,"L.A. on the Cheap, but the Good.","When we moved to North San Diego County two years ago, we bought a handful of guides to Los Angeles. This is the only one we still consistently use. It listed the closest hotel to UCLA, turned us on to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, gave us enough SoCal history so we didn't feel like out-of-town geeks dropped on cosmo-ville. I like the readable, matter-of-fact, and yes, entertaining entries; my husband (who relies on the other side of his brain more than I do) likes and uses the maps. It's the size, shape, and format of a trade paperback, not the odd vertical oversize that won't fit easily in a book- or handbag. UpClose is also realistic about LA price tags, and honest about the value of trendy eateries with good food. It even identifies the roofs with character worth bedding down under for a night ot two."
5,Choice collection of Bernard Hermann classics,"Amazon needs to rewrite this page to indicate next to the song titles all the different Hitchcock films this CD covers. It is an excellent collection, masterfully performed at a bargain price. The best parts of the famous 'Psycho,' 'Vertigo,' 'North by Northwest,' scores are included alongside more choice stuff from less popular Hichtcock films like 'The Trouble with Harry' and 'Marnie.' I have no complaints except the shower scene in Psycho is a little tame compared to the movie version."
2,disappointed....,"i love hitchcock, and i ADORE bernard herrmann - his string writing is truly amazing. i've been studying a lot of string music this past year or so, of course no one in academia much talks about him, my interest in him is all extracurricular, but he continues to be a favorite of mine. this cd is mostly orchestral, with the exception of the pieces from psycho, and the prague orchestra is out of tune! i didn't read the fine print and was expecting these to be the original recordings, and they are definitely not! the strings do ok, not great, but the winds and brass are really disappointing. the selection on the cd is great, the artistic direction is good, but i am really distracted by the intonation."
1,Lasted 5 minutes,"This thing work great for the first five minutes then it got all finicky. Waste of money. It gets stuck ind the chamber easily, easily removed with a rod. The on and off switch is a pain. The laser is bright enough when it actually works."
2,Bad Machining,The SSI Sight-Rite Laser bore sighter 30-06 Springfield does not fit my Winchester Model 70!!!At the range it was 5-6 inches high when adjusted to bore sighter! Distance of 50 yards! Afterresetting scope at range bore sighter shows low on crosshairs! Piece of junk! Does not fit!!!
5,Great Album!,"This is the debut album from the Cincinnati band, ""The Terrors."" I found it to be a great album from start to finish. Their style varies between Rock, Pop, and Hip Hop. Often the songs are ""trippy"" due to their willingness to experiment with different sounds and rhythms. All of the band members are great musicians and this is definitley a solid independent release."
3,"Flimsy, tear easily.","Flimsy, tear easily. They are adequate for my needs if laminated first, Item was shipped quickly and rec'vd as described. Thank you very much."
5,Horse Behavior Book,Great Book. I have learned a lot. Very informative and a must for anyone who loves being around horses! So glad I bought it!!!
2,Not what I expected...,"I bought this book hoping for some basic advice about horses with vices. What I got was an interesting but altogether not very helpful collection of letters that addressed VERY specific problems. The answers did not include anything that really helped me as a rider either. All in all, it's a neat read but more of a borrow-from-the-library than a good buy."
3,After market tail lights,"Fit right in, I notice the 1157 blubs is the old style not the new set up. That is ok. As long it works."
1,Poor,"For a book purporting to be of solved problems, then I cannot reccomend it at all. The workings are not very thorough... skipping out whole lines of calculation. This leaves you with the feeling that figures have just been plucked out of the air.Not very helpful for assistance with coursework or revision."
3,A little long on personal opinion,"The ""33 1/3"" books tend to go one of two ways:1) Lots of info about the band, recording sessions, reception, etc.2) Huge doses-sometimes an overdose-of personal opinion.This book falls in the latter. The author is a good writer, so it makes for a quick and easy read. I still think this album is under-documented in the actual making of, what the songs are about, etc., and this book is patchy in that area. But it's a good library addition for fans of this album and the ""33 1/3"" series in general."
4,Do Bananas Chew Gum ?,Althought the title made me a little uneasy about the book this book is very good. This book is about 12 year old Sam Mott. Sam has trouble reading and writing but when he gets a babysitting job he has trouble keeping how stupid he is a secret when the second grader is smarter than him. Sam's parents when him to take tests to find out how he learns better. Sam will lose his job if he doesn't take the tests. Will Sam take the tests? Read the book to find out?
3,A little bit confused,"I read this book, and I was astonished! I could not believe how vague Sam's brain was! He can't even spell top right! Nor read! Overall: The book was confusing, yet a little optimistic towards the end!"
4,Glad to find difficult to locate product,"I've tried to find this product several different places to no avail, so was pleased to find this seller and buy at decent price. Good service."
4,John Frieda,Enjoying the Joyhn Frieda beauty product. I never knew these things existed and am so glad to be able to find Frieda products at this site.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Now that it is fall, I was wanting a non-permanent product to blend in my summer highlights. This product did exactly that. It has also increased the shine in my hair and made it very soft. I read the other reviews before purchasing and was glad to find out that it did not make my hair smell bad, nor does it make my hair look greasy."
1,Could not use,I used it for only a week and did not see any color change but I had to stop using it because it made my hair oily.
2,Stains too easily,"This stuff smells great and does seem to work for making your color last a little longer, but it stained my hands and face so easily. I didn't want to have to put on gloves or make a big production out of everything everytime I wanted to use it so pretty much just stopped. Not worth it for me."
4,"Affordable and good product, hair becomes oily though","This is an affordable hair product and if you want to make your hair real shiny then you gotta use it. It makes your hair feel good, and also makes your hair a little softer. Before I used the product I read some reviews online about it and I agree with some of the people who have said that they felt their hair became oilier after using it. I have found out the best way of using this hair glaze is by not massaging or rubbing it onto your skin. Just touch it to your hair and that's it. However the drawback to this method is you will still have to use a separate product to wash your scalp. So first you wash your scalp with some separate shampoo and then you use this hair glaze."
2,I did not like it,"It might color the hair a little bit, but it leaves them very dry. You definetely need some leave-in conditioner after this product. I've used it a couple of times, then just colored my hair permanently, since it is too much hassle and overall the hair do not look terrific after it."
2,Did not work,"It didn't make my hair look horrible or anything which is why Im giving it 2 instead of one and it's cheap but .... It didn't make it shinier or ""richer"" color. In fact I have brown hair with a good deal of red in it and I got this hoping to darken up my hair and even out red tones. It made my hair seem MORE red and even a bit lighter. My friend even commented it looked more red. It smells gross too."
1,Didn't work for me,"This stuff was super runny which made it really difficult to try to apply it on my hair. It ended up getting everywhere. I saw no real difference in either my hair color or shine after multiple uses so this product was a complete waste for me. I would also like to add that it smells terrible! I noticed another commenter stated that it made their hair more red, and I had the same issue, as well. I naturally have red undertones, and dye my hair with ash colors to counteract the red. If you have similar hair, you may want to avoid this since it seems to bring out the red."
4,great color boost/root touch up,"It think this is a great product. It does exactly what it says and is easy to use. The smell is pleasant and the color comes off your hands once you move on to washing up after application. I am using it in conjunction with the JF color shampoo and conditioner.My only complaint it that the product is a little too runny. With wet hands the product easily falls onto the floor, or on you."
2,Did just about nothing for my hair,"I like this product line a lot, but this particular item did almost nothing for my hair (and did make a big mess in the tub). I didn't notice any enhancement to the shine or color of my hair, but it did seem a little softer than usual."
3,Use after your shower (not during!) for a quick touch up...,"I love this product but I do not use it in the recommended way which I found to be ridiculously inconvenient (apply in shower and leave for 3 min...every other day...) not to mention messy--hence the 3 star rating (that and really, where is the shine!?).However, this product is a lifesaver when used in between full head dye sessions! If you get those wispy grays around your hairline then, with hair damp, put a drop or 2 on a tooth brush and comb away from face until fully blended. Just leave in...do your hair as you normally would. Smells good, has never harmed my hair when used this way. And, bottle lasts forever using it a few drops at a time:)"
5,A first of its kind...,"In our postmodern age, it's rare (if not almost unheard of) to find music that classifies as ""unique"". But this CD is definitely it - you get the feeling this is music is at least twenty years' ahead of its time. Some cuts are better than others - while some of the DJ's just resort to dropping some kitschy samples over the beats, some of the others are incredible reproductions of the original. This is worth the price of admission if only for Craze's reinterpretation of the Propellerheads and the Scratch Perverts doing Photek..."
3,"High impact, not for everyone","This is a challenging workout. Please do not buy this if you are not able to do high impact moves. This workout is fast, very fast for step aerobics, and all of the moves are propulsion moves. All of them. This woman bounces with every step. Kelly is energetic, very good at what she does, and the workout is a probably great for people who already know how to kick-box and do advanced step aerobics. However, I do step aerobics because I have a bad knee, and can not do any high impact moves. I did this work-out once, working to modify each move. However, that is a lot of trouble, and it makes more sense to simply buy a DVD with a step routine that I can do."
5,Love Kelly,"I own both her Step-Boxing DVDs I love this one because it's about 45 minutes of pure Cardio and perfect if you don't have more than an hour to spare on a busy schedule. However, it does have more weight/cardio after the pure cardio if you do have the time.I use it before work. I do the 45 minutes and then shower and head off, it energizes my entire day.This workout is intense, and it is a complete burn. It may not be for beginners."
4,Moving and Moving,Let me just say WOW. I love this DVD. I just bought it. Kelley has become my new work-out partner. This work is intense and I will say it is an intermediate routine. You will get an good workout using this DVD.
4,"Good but very, very hard","I'm not use to using a step, but if you are then this is a good hard class for you! Enjoy I'm going to keep at it until I can do without stopping to catch my breath and balance!"
3,Good story - Bad Production,"I generally like Indie movies, and I kinda liked this one, but...First off, the video/production quality is awful. I guess I have a new appreciation for ""post production"" now. This thing at times looks little better than a YouTube download.On top of that, the ""Hired gun of the Lord"" angle is just plain moronic. Suggestion to producer: Next time, talk to a few real Christian's before attempting to portray one.The rest of the acting is equally afwul.Aside from that, the story is actually quite good. The lead actor is pretty good too. But everyone and everything else in the movie is just plain stupid.This one would have benefited greatly from some religious research, and some better directing.Again, the story is interesting, and intriguing, but the acting and the lack of decent post production just killed it.Would like to see some more from the lead actor/protagonist, though."
3,Tony Mitchell is a master gatherer,"Tony Mitchell has once again triumphed in creatively gathering the most talented erotic photogropers working today. A definite converastion source at any dinner party that needs breaking the ice. A conversation, moreover, that could lead to genuiunely interesting exchages. This book is a definite turn-on, as are his other collections, such as ""Fetish."" Not for the prudish coffee table."
5,Packed with wild and wicked imagery,"From Tony Mitchell, the editor of Skin Two magazine, comes this collection of wild images that either shock viewers or turn them on big time. The general theme is artistic erotica but its forays into fetishism, bondage, and sadomasochism are its mainstay. And it's packed with wild and wicked imagery. From beautiful nudes to all-out kinky sex this book bares it all. As noted by the publisher, Edition-Skylight, ""In the last couple of decades, the depiction of these subjects has become of increasingly legitimate in the world of art photography, and the effect of this has been to regale us with much better quality images as well as to remove stigma..""A wide variety of artists are gathered here in epic force including, Craig Morey, Lee Higgs, Carlos Batts, Alva Bernadine, Bob Carlos Clarke, John Dieterich, Steve Diet Goedde, China Hamilton, Kevin Hundsnurcher, Roman Kasperski, Dave Naz, Christophe Mourthe, Tony Ward, Trevor Watson, Ben Westwood, and many others."
3,"verstile book, not really my style","i love erotic phtography but i have to say this is not the greatest example for such a book.the book show a veraity of phtographers with good CV and information, which's always nice to now, it's printed very well and is in really good quality and design. from that angle i have to say - it's better them most books i came across, my problems withit are mostly with editing and choice of photos. the book's sepearted in 4 diffrent chategories which i didn't see much diffrence between, most photos could appeare in all chapters (dadicated to - fetishwear, diciplane, bondage and extream play)., i would much rather have it seperated to artist rather then those sections. also a lot of those photos seem cheap to me, a lot of the models are playboy material (so not my kind of woman) and there's far too much skin and latex rather then anything interesting artisticly.it's a good turn-on book, too bad it's shallow and not intelectualy stimulating as well as physicly."
5,A great record!,"This is an excellent record, which has a full spectrum ranging from dynamic/upbeat songs filled with great sense of humor to poetic lyrics, even sadness and underlying rich melodies. The singer's voice is warm and mature; the record is truly original. I had trouble to find the record in various stores but once I located and listened the songs I realized it was definitely worth the trouble!"
1,Cuisinart TOB-30 not good,"Just after warranty, the toaster function stopped working. On a search, this seems to be a common problem."
1,Crap product,"I buy the TOB-30BC model for around 130$ CDN. I need a good versatile oven for every day stuff, not only for toast. So I decide to add some extra money for a oven that seems good.This product is a total crap. Dont buy this! I dont understand how this company can still sell this oven, because it is a total failure.There is four setting: BAKE, BROIL, TOAST and OFF!!! It is mention in the manual that you need to set the oven to ""OFF"" when you dont use it! An alarm can be trigger if it is not set to off after a while! Can you imagine that?There is no difference between the BROIL setting and the BAKE setting. Everything is set to BROIL!! The only setting that use the BAKE grill is the toast setting. I think that the designer decide to put a BAKE setting as an illusion of functionality. This oven does not worth 15$, get away from this crap. I will never buy anything from this company again.EtienneMontreal"
2,Do not recommed.,Look is not nice and it is presenting a problem that sometimes FM does not tune well and all I listen to is noise.
3,Moosewood Restaurant Daily Special: More than 275 Recipes for Soups.,"I'm sure that many will find may of the soup recipes contained in this book to be appealing. My wife tends to stick to the recipes handed down by her mother. That said, the book is worth a look if one is not satisfied with the recipes one uses."
5,Beautiful food!,"You cannot go wrong with Moosewood. This collection is a delighful journey for all who like to eat fresh, light, and flavorfully. The recipes are straightforward and easy to follow. The bonus is the salad pairing suggestions. Some unusual combinations which really pay off, others expected, but all is wonderful. Kudos! A new keeper in my library."
4,Delicious Soups!,I live in chilly northern Vermont and after a long day of skiing there is nothing more delicious than a bowl of homemade soup. This cookbook has lots of recipes and all the ones I have made thus far have been outstanding. This is a good cookbook to have. You'll enjoy it!
5,Easy vegetarian fare,"I love the Moosewood Restaurant, and I think Daily Specials is one of their best cookbooks. I bought this one as a gift, but I have been cooking from it for years. The ""Daily Specials"" aren't meant to be main courses, but I've always used them as such."
2,Be forewarned that it contains many fish/shellfish recipes!,"Since the Moosewood Collective is probably the best-known source of vegetarian recipes and cookbooks, I was horrified by the number of recipes containing fish, shellfish, and seafood products (e.g., clam juice). Checking the index for recipes of certain types or using specific ingredients, I was not thrilled to repeatedly find that the recipe in question contained ingredients a vegetarian wouldn't touch.Obviously, this is not a problem for people merely eager to add more veggies and grains to their diets, or for those who eschew meat and poultry, but eat seafood as well as veggies/grains. However, for those of us who had come to equate Moosewood with vegetarian, this came as a very nasty surprise. I wish that the title had read ""not strictly vegetarian"" or ""includes some fish/shellfish recipes""."
1,Worst coffee maker we've ever owned,We bought this Cuisinart coffee maker because of the reputation of the manufacturer and it appeared to have all the features we wanted. The coffee tastes okay but the pot leaks. You can never pour the water into the reservoir without quite a bit of water landing on your countertop. Water also leaks from the space between the glass and the plastic water spout at the top of the pot. It is extremely difficult to determine how much water is in the machine after you've added it. You end up with a fine sediment of coffee grinds in the coffee due to the poor filter. We've had this coffee maker for about three weeks and I am about to throw it in the trash. Do yourself a favor and skip this product. I think I'm going back to the Mr. Coffee brand- never had a problem with those and we're big coffee drinkers in this house.
2,Hard to clean,"Makes a good hot cup of coffee. However the coffee and the water are added in the same place, and there is no barrier between the two areas. It is very easy to spill coffee grounds into the water resevoir, and coffee grounds easily stick to the water sprayer. It is difficult to clean the machine."
5,Great book on great painter,"Here's another great aid for understanding the life and works of one of most ignored genius. Great story on great painter. Plentiful of color reproductions, abundant in information, great source for studying tormented painter. Worth every minute spent on reading. By the way - was he alcoholic? Nenad from Croatia."
2,not that happy,"I was not that impressed with the book. It only gave one practice exam in each field. It also didn't mention areas that should be reviewed before taking the exam. I took the general science exam and it was hard, hopefully I passed so I won't have to take it again."
2,Outdated Information,"Despite the 2005 copyright, this book has outdated test information, particularly for the subtest. It refers to a no-longer included section and has other inconsistencies with the current test. If you use this book, make very sure to read the test bulletin provided online very carefully to make sure you are studying for the test you will actually take. I found this book to be no help at all studying for the test. I had to get another study guide and luckily I did. Because of this other Praxis II study guide at [...](and prayer), I was able to pass the exam!! I really liked the answer key, not only did they explain WHY the answer is what it is, but why the other answers were incorrect. I found this very helpful in the areas I needed to strenghten. If you get no other study book, THIS is the one. I only had a total of about 8 hours study time with the Praxis II mentoring I received and I passed with flying colors."
2,Weak on Content,"I was looking for help on one specific topic. There were 20 questions total. The real test will have 6 times that. In all, it didn't give me any idea the kinds of topics to expect or the difficulty of questions I'm looking at. And there's no explination for the answer key. Save your money. Buy a book that's specific to the test you're taking. Out of this entire book, I used 5 pages (counting the answer key)."
1,I Wish I Hadn't ...,"...ordered this book. It was less than nonhelpful for studying for the Middle School Reading Language Arts Praxis II (1049). The content of the sample tests actually made me feel that I was in no way going to be able to pass this test. In addition, the provided no information that could help me learn what I apparently did not know. Get the Cliffs Test Prep. Just in time, I realized that it was a comprehensive, stand-alone study guide that will continue to be useful as a classroom reference tool. P.S. I passed with flying colors."
5,Great buy at a great price,"Lexmark X83 is a thermal ink-jet scanner/printer/copier with a fax machine in one simple to use, affordable package. The X83 allows black/white printing up to 12 pages per minute and 6 pages per minute in color. It also includes a 48-bit color flatbed scanning and also acts a copier. In the copier mode, you can make up to 10 copies per minute in black and 3 copies per minute in color. I haven't used the Fax features yet, but this is a complete scanner, copier, printer solution in one.I used this printer under Windows 2000 without any problems, but had a few problems under Windows XP. Tech support was very helpful in solving my problems. After upgrading the printer firmware to the latest version, I was able to use it successfully under Windows XP. Great buy at a great price."
2,"Worked fine until error: ""unlock scanner""","One day after about a year of ownership, my Lexmark X83 came back with this dreaded message for no apparent reason. The Lexmark support site instructs you to unplug and turn the unit on it's left side. This didn't do the trick and now it's time to plan the funeral."
2,can't print one decent photograph on photo paper,"We've had this printer at work for several years. It is great for black and white file copies. But printing photos is disappointing 99.9% of the time. If you print on plain paper, they look great. But put in a sheet of photo paper, select the photo paper settings, and you get a mess. On the standard settings the print is waaaay too dark. Or you only get some colors, or you get an odd streak down one section of the picture. Adjust the brightness setting 10 different ways on the computer print window and it still never comes out right. You have to waste 5 sheets of photo paper for every photo that is remotely useable. When we first bought this I scanned a leaf that printed out beautifully lifelike. That was the last thing I remember looking good with this printer. Photos---forget it."
3,Not impressed,"We have owned this printer/scanner/copier, etc. for a little while. I have never been impressed with it. A couple of times it has just stopped working and we had to call and get assistance with troubleshooting. We ended up having to flick this red switch. Now it does it a few times a year. It works again, but it is just a pain to deal with. Lately it hasn't wanted to work at all. I am just not impressed with this item. It works well as a scanner, I haven't ever used it as a fax and it works OK as a copier. I don't like the printing quality, especially for pictures."
2,The Cons Outweigh the Pros,"I know most of what I have to say has been said before regarding this machine, but:1. The USB cable is not included to hook it up to your PC! This seems ridiculous to me, Lexmark should be ashamed.2. The ink cartridges are obnoxiously priced. $30-40 a piece and they don't last very long.it does a nice job of scanning and printing, unfortunatley, the price of getting the cable and new cartriges is something most people are forewarned about."
1,DON'T!,"Bought X83 because my space insufficient for three separate devices. Returned it in 11 days. Nearly drove me nuts trying to install (I hadn't heeded reviews that said installation ""difficult""). White stripes across bw and color copies; email tech support said clean cartridges. Didn't help. Had earlier telephoned tech support when printer wouldn't communicate after I installed USB hub; held wire 35 mins and was told X83 won't support hub (though no warning in manual). When email tech support said now telephone tech support since email instructions to clean cartidges hadn't helped, couldn't face another interminable wait and returned this miserable instrument, the manufacturer of which gives equally lousy support. Yuk!"
2,Be wary of this printer,I purchased this printer a few months ago and was impressed with it for about two weeks. The third week was when I tried to enable printer sharing over my home network. This printer is not networkable (confirmed with Lexmark Tech Support) which means no printer sharing. It also means that you will not be able to use the new fast user switching ability under Windows XP (also confirmed with Lexmark Tech Support). I am probably going to sell this printer and spend the extra money to get an HP mulitfunction device. The old adage is true: You get what you pay for.
2,Lexmark X83 hides limitations,"My chief gripe is that you cannot network the printer. I've owned various Canon and HP printers over the years and never even thought that someone would market a printer with drivers incapable of being networked. It makes me think that Lexmark is in a different age. I can understand their challenges with making the X-series share the scanning abilities, but they should support simple printing from other home PC's on the network."
1,Lexmark X83 Scanner-Printer-Copier,"This item was paid for and I have not received it nor has the seller contacted me about why it was not sent! I'm upset over this but what are you going to do? Live and Learn, I guess. It's hard to trust people because of things like this happens!!"
2,Lexmark X83 Scanner,"Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't...but that's on my PC which I bought from DELL who had been trouble shooting this printer since it arrived at my residence. I tried everything to get it to work and allowed Dell Techs 2.5 months to try and solve the problem. I finally said ""enough is enough"". I requested a refund for the cost of the printer and was promptly denied because of the Dell 30 day allotted inspection period policy. As for the Lexmark X83, I'm sure it's a wonderful product on someone else's machine...If you own a Dell, make sure it works properly within 30 days and forget Tech Support."
2,Install and instructions for using,Installing is a pain.It took me 4 times to get it to work.There are not enough instructions telling you how all the features work.
1,Dont waste your money.....,"Ill make it short and simple, the printer intalls fine and worked ok (I stress ok because I bought photo paper and only 1 out of 5 pictures printed out photo quality) there might be a few options to play around with. But..... when I went to use it the next day the computer did not reconize it and it hasnt worked since. I uninstalled and reinstalled everything a few times and still no luck. I have a few freinds with Lexmark printers and some of them have the same problem. Conclusion, good printer for the price if it acually worked, you get what you pay for. Next I am going to spend a few dollars more to get an HP, I would advise the same."
2,frustrated,"The ""help"" information is not very helpful. I still can't figure out how to scan to different programs or how to scan several images onto the same email, etc... If the Lexmark x83 came with usable directions, it might be a good product. I may never find out."
1,the INcomplete Collector's Edition,"the box set contained two DVDs of the second season and was missing the DVD for the seventh season... I returned it... and I'm still waiting on my money... Amazon has said that my bank accepted the money, but the money is NOT in my account."
5,"X-Files, A Must Have Collection",This item was SUPER CHEAP!!! and I knew I had to get it. This is a must collection for all you paranormal people out there. This set feature the complete collection of the X-Files series A-Z. This boxed set has everything you can get in the Seasons that is sold separately.This set also comes with a great bunch of freebies that is totally awesome. Let me tell you guys do not miss out. A great fan item.
4,Great Buy,"I had only seen the first season of the X-Files before buying this box set. I must say for all nine seasons, the movie, and extras- the price is reasonable. My only complaint is that my season 8 has a second disc 4 in the place where disc 6 is supposed to be. Two disc 4's, no disc 6. Aside from that, I am very happy with my set."
2,"Box drawer won't open, box broken in several areas","""First of all because of the weight of the cds it broke through the box into the compartment under that holds the episode guide etc. etc. This caused the compartment to get stuck and you could not get it out.""This quoted text from a previous review is almost exactly the way I got my set from 12/5/2008...I have initiated a return and replacement...I will update this review with the condition of the replacement when received...Updated 12/15/2008: I have received replacement...The new one received, shows the same signs of weakness and actual cracks and tears...While the DVDs are OK so far, the packaging really is not adequate...At least I can open the drawer in the new box..."
4,Great Set,"The set is great, I just hate how Seasons 1 through 4 are in Full Frame. The movie and 5-9 are in Widescreen. It's a pretty beautiful set and I think if you don't already own the show then you should buy it, if you do, then it depends on how big of a fan you are."
1,Doesn't play,I am very disappointed when i received this item. Many of the disks will not play in my DVD player or on my Blue-ray player. For the amount of money i spent on it i expected more and was greatly disappointed in what i got.
4,"great series, poor design",this is obviously one the alltime great tv series and you really get a lot for your money. the only thing preventing me from giving this a 5 star rating is the poor design of the product. the drawer is a PITA to open because of the weight of all the dvd's sitting on top of the drawer. the inside of the box that houses the dvd's is torn from being cheaply made and not strong enough. you have to take all the dvd's out to open the drawer which contains all the extras.
4,Love it!!!,Awesome collection ive been wanting the whole collection for years and now i have it all in one collection. but im going to have to agree with some other customers about the bad packaging. the drawer on mine opened the first time and never did again lol. so ieventually just tore both sides off the front of it and now just pull the front of it down to be able to get to the stuff in it. also the the side facing up on one of the seasons cases has a small gash in it. it must of been done before it was put into the big case cuz i see no marks anywhere else on the case by it. and also the back of the season 1 case had came unglued but i just glued it back and looks good so no problem there. i would of gave this a 5 but the cuz of the bad packaging im giving it a 4 but this is an awesome collection id recommend it to anyone fan or newcomer to the series.
3,THIS SET IS UNDER A $100.00 ON EBAY DUMMIES,"IF YOU DON'T MIND A FEW ASIAN CHARACTERS ON THE BOX, YOU CAN GET THE COMPLETE SET SHIPPED TO YOUR DOOR FOR $75.00."
2,No Pull Out Drawer No Bonus Items. Awful Packaging,"Just got mine in the mail today, doesn't have a pull out drawer. It seems to be a slim style set, very small cheap cases that the dvds are in. Very unhappy for the money i spent. Comes with nothing but the dvds no bonus content."
2,Xfile seasons 1-9,"Product is what was described (Seasons 1 through 9), but NOT as pictured! Pictured is the box set. What I received were the TV Combo packs (2 seasons shrink wrapped together), except for season 9, which was separate. They were brand new, as described.I would suggest using the CORRECT picture when listing an item. I would NOT have bought this, if I knew exactly what it was. I wanted the box sets, as pictured.Also, VERY slow shipper!"
3,Could have been better.,"I've watched all nine seasons of this show (FYI: I did not purchase this set I'm putting my review under). The following is my thoughts about the show, not the product being sold (I saw some negative reviews about that). To keep this short, the concept of the show is good, but I felt the deviations away from the main theme of the ""alien/government conspiracy"" was just filler for the FOX network to capitalize on. It seemed that the show picked up steam when that theme was present. The annoying deviations I'm referring to were episodes that dealt with various, and many times laughable, assorted creatures or other non-alien related ""paranormal"" phenomenon. Bottom line: I don't regret watching this show, but I'm glad I spent as little as possible (I watched it on a popular online video streaming service)."
3,Not complete,"There was a missing disc and the box the DVDs came in was sort of broken. Also, one of the DVDs is all in chinese and I can't figure out how to fix it."
5,very annoying,yeah this would be great if i had'nt already spent a fortune buying the series. if you don't own the series already a great buy at 230.
3,nice package for the price unless you want to actually watch it,"This would be a great deal which I thought it was when I got this as a gift from my husband and daughter. They know I absolutely love X-Files and a deal like this is just the thing for the most die hard junkie like me. However, if you try to play it on a ps2 it won't play and 2 of our other newer dvd players would not play the discs either, I was beginning to believe we had been completely ripped off when I tried it on our oldest dvd player we owned and it actually worked. Inconvenient to say the least and disappointing but at least not a total loss, like I said it is perfect unless you actually want to watch it then you may have a problem or two."
4,Best all-inclusive box,I've always believed the best way to watch these shows was to get the box of the entire series. This set is a great opporunity for anyone to experience all that is the X-Files at their leisure. My only concern is the longevity of the cardboard packaging.
4,X FILES RULES !!!!,The X files is an amazing show. I bought this boxed set and im in the middle of watching season 5. but i gave it only 4 stars cuz the box arrived damaged. The outside of the box looked great but the drawer wouldnt pull out so i looked inside and found that the cardboard shelf holding the dvds above the drawer had sunken in. so i had to take it all out and duct tape the shelf up so that i can access whats in the drawer. I didnt want to return it cuz i was afraid i would get one back that was in worse shape than the one i got. so i fixed it and kept it cuz i also couldnt wait to watch. I LOVE YOU MULDER !!!!!!
1,great show/ terrable collection,beware this collection from 20th century fox. by the time you watch all the discs & find all the bad ones it will be to late to return it. there are so many flawwed discs in this set & i didn't come across them untill i started watching the latter seasons. once again i am completely dissapointed in the quallity of fox's products. spend the money & buy them one at a time learn from my mistake.
5,Has It All!,"I was going to start purchasing the individual seasons from Amazon, and was pleasantly amazed to find this complete set. It has it all in a great box with excellent accessories like books, cards, posters, etc. Mine even came with 2 free passes to the movies! I plan on using those for the new movie coming out in a few weeks.Overall, this is a great set for someone who hasn't yet purchased any of the X-Files DVDs already out."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this product hoping to be able to watch through it all. First of all because of the weight of the cds it broke through the box into the compartment under that holds the episode guide etc. etc. This caused the compartment to get stuck and you could not get it out. As i began watching the first season some episodes skipped a little, i though ok it was shipped i guess i can deal with it. But getting into the 2nd season some episodes started skipping alot and some cds just did not read altogether. Because of this i checked through all of the cds and i found many of them to be comepletely scratched. I beleive this occured because of the bad packaging that the cds come in. They do not come in jewel cases. They come in this cardboard cd holder which holds all of the cds. I suggest buying season by season in normal DVD cases which."
1,"Love the show, hate the DVDs","I also had problems with defective DVDs. And the biggest problem is that it takes so long to get through the entire series you don't know if the later disks are defective until it's too late to return itMy other problem with the disks is that they don't have the play all feature. I can't stand it when they won't add this feature, and ultimately I never end up watching them because I don't like stopping what I'm doing to work through the menus to get to the next episode.It's really a shame because it is a really great show."
2,"Started out enjoying the series, ended up HATING it.",I ended up hating this series because I got sick and tired of them NEVER resolving a story but always leaving you hanging and totally confused. Each episode teases and teases and then NEVER resolves the story. Really pissed me off. I watched the entire series and still don't have a f*$*ing clue what in the hell it was about. The only highlight is the set packaging which is really good.
1,Total Waste of Money,"Bought this at Christmastime, finally got around to watching it, or trying to. Every disc was scratched. Only half of them play. Shame on you, Amazon."
4,X-Files: Almost Complete Collector's Edition,"Includes the entire series and the first movie only. I'm rating this 4 stars b/c the set is missing the second movie. This was a gift and they think the set is ""very good."""
1,x-files ultimate collection,"Box looked good until shrink wrap removed. Found case torn inside and around drawer ends. Unable to open drawer. Some DVD holders looked worn too.Amazon sent a replacement. The replacement is in worse condition, with the box itself torn and the inside base jammed into the drawer.Spent about 4 hours on the phone with Amazon off shore customer service (several calls) and tried e-mail too. E-mail replies came from off shore too and were not responsive to my questions."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON...GET IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!,"Ok, first of all, I love the show and I love this set. One of my favorite shows and this collection is just perfect. This review is not a reflection of the product, just its condition.That said....DO NOT get this product from Amazon! I can't believe I have to say this, I've been ordering from here for years and years and never had a single problem...until now. Not only was the box horribly damaged due to poor, inadequate packing, but most of the discs were defective. I ordered a replacement, which was sent promptly, and thought that was the end of my troubles. Unfortunately, the replacement was in even worse shape and had just as many defective discs as the last. So I beseech you, do not get this product here, get it somewhere else! It's amazing and well worth the price, but not here. Not if you want to actually watch the show, anyway."
1,X-FILE DISSAPOINTMENT,"I bought The X-Files: The Complete Collector's Edition as a special gift for my husband's 60th birthday - It was one of his favorite TV shows. It ""WAS"" until now that is. Each disc has been one disappointment after another. They start to freeze up as you near the end of each show. Every time we start watching a new episode I start to get anxious praying we reach the end without a glitch and when it does freeze up I feel more frustrated by the minute. At this point, I am out $190 and now face having to buy a new set to replace this defective X-File fiasco. I will NEVER buy used DVD's from Amazon again. I have learned a very expensive lesson."
4,How cool is this?,"They have a name like a long forgotten mod band, and the album cover looks like a relic from the dying days of indie rock, when Thee Hypnotics, Spacemen 3, Union Carbide Productions and the Loop were spewing out Stooges sound alikes and nobody had ever heard of the cancer that is Courtney Love. The first song has a first term Nixon era Detroit sound, but after that come note perfect recreations of Status Quo circa Piledriver. Play Summer Sun Blues for any of your 40 year old British friends and watch their eyes light up."
3,For Serious Jack White Fans,"This album is for those of you that wonder what Jack White would sound like with a real band backing him up. The Go are definitely an under appreciated band. However, while the music rocks, the production on this album is lacking, in places the drums are almost non-existent. Someone (Jack) should remix this album and it would be AWESOME.The Go's second, last, and self titled album is easier on the ear and I highly recommend it. However, if you consider yourself a true fan of the White Stripes you should check this out.Keep on Trash - is a raw romp, you can hear the beginning of screwdriver in Jack's leadSuzy don't leaveTired of the nightOn the Corner - all really cool tunes."
2,A comprehensive book....however...,"While this book certainly covers the genealogy of the Peters family; it is very poorly organized and is difficult to follow familial lines after the first few pages. Be prepared to ""dig"" through it in order to find what you need!"
1,broke after 6 months,"The menus were always hard to navigate, but at least I could use it as a USB storage device. Now, the player will not turn on at all. I've contacted the company, so hopefully I'll get a response."
5,This is a great kitchen helper,"Honest to goodness, this is the best $20 you'll ever spend if you like to cook. No kidding. So much easier than a blender since you don't have a blender to clean -- the blade end twists off and you can put it in the top rack of your dishwasher. Ihave had mine for years and it is going strong. Great for pureed soups and dips and dressings.You need to become facile with positioning so you don't wind up with hot splattering liquid, so be sure you are careful until you get the hang of it. Try to pool liquid/soup so it covers the blades, for example. Don't try to do a very small amount of something that is liquid else you might be burned and/or make a mess. This used to come with a kind of tall plastic cup that made the most out of small amounts and gave you some protection from making a mess. If it no longer does, I would get something like this. Then you can also store it in this cup -- standing on your counter."
3,Home Businesses,"It is a good book, but not for me. I guess I am limited in the things I know/do, and therefore the book was not very helpful to me. I do think it will be helpful to others."
4,What I expected.,"A basic descriptions of different jobs or professions, but gives options on how to proceed and references to help one to get started in a chosen business."
4,Gives good Ideas & Resources,This book is a great book for ideas. It also is well organized. It doesn't really meet all the needs of someone who may be handicapped. At least it didn't meet mine.
2,not for everyone,"while this book had some ideas , for many of the jobs you need a certain skill. most of this information is common sense. while it may be usefull to some i found it to be a waste of money."
5,Practical and Helpful-- Brimming Over with Ideas,"If you're over 50, or even just approaching that age, you'll want to read this book. Unfortunately, ageism is a very real issue, but the Edwards' explain how to turn a perceived drawback into a very strong asset. They identify jobs that are well suited to those 50+, including some you probably didn't think of (e.g., Wedding Planner, Daily Money Manager, etc.). Aside from the job descriptions, I really like the resources sections, which point you to places for more details. Highly recommended."
3,"Good for stimulating thought, but...","I run a very successful homebased business,and am always reading on the subject.This is a good book, but more designed for someone without a corporate or serious business background. It consists of 70 ideas that a person might consider in forming their own business,and there are some details given on each.I guess it was just more appropriate for someone not in his own business than for someone who is.As an aside, for someone who does have a business/corporate background,my suggestion is to strongly consider the executive search/recruiting field.(Don't worry; your niche market will not be the same as mine.) The best most comprehensive foundational work on it is the CD series Successful Search and Placement! by Larry Nobles or his book on the same subject.Highly worthwhile as a homebased business for someone with the right qualities of personality and background."
2,Below average Bundy (dont listen to the idiot above!),"This particular Bundy episode is not funny. It lacks the depth and array of derrogatory jokes that we are use to in the more classic Bundy episodes. I love Al, guest star Sam Kinison, and the whole cast. But even Kinison cannot save this particular Married with Children from the fire in hell in which it has been summoned to."
2,It's Not A Wonderful Life,"Not with the Bundy's. Now I know why I never watched this show. It is so rude. Funny though, I could take the risky controversial madness of ALL IN THE FAMILY and I love that show. I just don't appreciate it on Married With Children.I guess it is only hilarious to those who love it."
5,Great bag with great value!,"The value of the bag is greater than the price itself!Many compartment and easily fit a 15"" notebook with still some room available.See [...] for video review."
3,Quite good,"This was delivered very fast. Good product, padding is quite light (practically non existent) on the top, and reduces safety for the top corners of 17"" laptops. Smaller laptops might be okay.Storage capacity is excellent - would not expect it of a bag of this cost and size. I liked the color as well and I found the style to my liking.Quality is typical Samsonite - very good. Very good value for money."
5,Terrific stuff,"The Amazon review summs this up nicely. The CD does a great job of capturing a live set. The instrumentation alone is enough to stop you in your tracks: ""Take 5"" on classical gutiar, harmonica and jaw harp!! -- and no! it's not just a novelty take off.The level of musicianship is equaled by the level of the fun these guys are having.One more thing, if fretless electric bass matters to you, you'll find Chris Brubeck's work here is magic not just the jaw-dropping 16ths on New Stew (which he plays faultlessly while singing!) but catch what he does under Joel Brown's ""Road to Thomasville""."
2,not near the usual rubbermaid quality,these are now made of very cheap hard nonflexible material. I was very disappointed in the new version of the rubbermaid products
5,Every child (and adult!) deserves this book.,"This is another five-star favorite that I read to my children, and we all remember it fondly 20 years later. It's a gentle, lovely story with sweet illustrations that perfectly captures a child's attachment to his beloved stuffed dog and the generosity of his sister."
5,Lovely and Charming,"A 1001 CBYMRBYGU. Dave mislays his old stuffed dog, but Dogger somehow finds his way back home. The story is lovely and the pictures are charming. I cannot imagine even a curmudgeon curmudgeonly enough to dislike this story."
5,DOGGER,"My daughter, Karin loved this book 25 years ago. At that time it was David's Dog. She is a teacher now and wanted it for her classroom. She still loves it."
5,Greatest children's book ever,"This is the best book to read to young children, fantastic story and lovely pictures. My favourite children's book and still amazing. A moral tale"
2,I have received this item and I agree with the title,"The service was exactly blah. It did nothing for me, there was no ray of sunshine. Instead, I felt as though the service provider were merely going through the motions, reading from a script. I would not purchase this if I needed it."
4,Super powerful mixer,"I have owned this mixer for two years and have had none of the problems cited by the other reviewers. The mixer is not too heavy and the beaters always stay in place if you put them into the mixer properly. My only complaint is that there is no ""low"" speed; at the lowest setting this mixer will give you stiffly beaten eggs in less than 10 seconds."
2,I paid 10.00,"I just bought this for $10.00, I hope that it's not as bad as the other 2 people say it is. It seems to be easy to clean and looks nice. Is a bit heavy, but as an extra, I'll keep it."
5,Strrraigght GANGSTA! Get ya' Swag on!,"I cant think of nothing more dope on earth than this long bill hat. I got a candy-coated donk on 26""s, and it's a rag-top to boot! But it get's hot and sunny in the summertime, and I need some extra shade while I'm bumpin' Sade' and sipping a virgin mojito. Ladies recognize game with this here.Back in the day, it was all about Kangol's, then it was all about team hats, then it was all about paying over three hundred dollars for a limited edition hat. This is more baller than all that. Big and long and wide, it's great for the links, croquette, patio parties at the country club, light freshwater sailing, or looking for a double 12"" box at the swap meet.It's got a nice adjustable velcro strap in the back that doesn't mess up my super-fly. Also great for running red lights and ducking your head down low at the cameras."
3,the green choice,This product has become hard to find locally. We like it because it is a refill package for our filter frame....less waste
2,Cheap Filters are Crap,"I used these filters for about two years thinking they were a great deal on decent filters. I recently upgraded to the 2200 rating Filtrete Elite filters from 3M and the difference is instantly noticeable. First of all, I no longer have to deal with the smell of dust burning off when my furnace comes on if it hasn't been run in a while. Second, the air quality in my home has gone up considerably. It used to be easy to see dust floating in the air if I turned off the lights and looked at the beam of a flashlight. Now, I see almost nothing. I had been having dust allergy problems at home in my office, bedroom, and general living areas. Now, I feel great and can breathe easily whenever I'm in my unit. Don't waste your money on these cheap filters, they won't do much and aren't best for your heating or air conditioning system. Instead, spend a little extra on a better filter and you will enjoy much higher air quality and (allegedly) longer furnace life."
2,"good edition, horrible binding","This is a great collection of some beautiful works. The problem is that the book is bound horribly. The pages are glued rather than stitched, so the book does not open flat, and when force is applied to ""wear in"" certain pages, the glue does not hold and the pages begin to fall out of the book. Also some pages aren't printed very well, and the print has a ""shadow"".If only I could find this same collection with better production quality, it would be perfect; I regret buying this, however. It's cheaply made-- and I know you generally get what you pay for, but for this same price I got an amazing Schirmer's edition of Chopin's Preludes, Waltzes, and Nocturnes. For Brahms, however, next time I will look elsewhere for a more expensive edition. Don't buy this unless you don't mind your pages falling out, all the while the book refusing to stay open."
1,rip off,"this seller posted a bag of 15 pounds of beans for almost $30, and sent about 2 or 3 pounds of cheap beans. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER"
4,Unique game,"My 5 year old received this game for Christmas. Although we found the directions to be a little vauge, we have enjoyed playing it our own way. You definitely challenge your sense of touch, which is so often overlooked. And you can set the rules to make the game harder or easier depending on who is playing. The game is durable but it would be very easy to lose the little pieces which would ruin the game as the pieces are so unique. The directions make no mention of ordering individual pieces that may get lost. I would recommend this game to families who enjoy playing lots of different games together."
3,Has some cloggin problems...Tips,"Good ink, but ran out of the yellow very soon. I also thought I had run out of ink at one point, but the problem was that it was clogged. The ""clean the nozzle test"" didn't work (as usual). So I placed the nozzle holes carefully in warm water for a few minutes. I had a teapot with water boiling. Once I got some steam, I put the bottom part of the cartidge to the steam. Once I saw ""ink beads"" appeared, I cleaned it and right away put them in my printer and printed something. It works well again. So, before you go buy these expensive cartidges, try these tips and see if they will work again."
2,Lexmark Ink for 1100 Series,"I had been purchasing this product from here. However my last order gave me several problem's and the container, quit at half use, the other order's from here gave me no problem's, so it could be just a one time problem. However, though I recommend these on that basis, I will purchase OEM products only. From Lexmark."
2,Great if you like being on the receiving end of a hot poker,"Seriously, this is great ink if you have a Lexmark printer - especially since nothing else will work (in my printer anyway). Lexmark has a reputation that seems deserved from my limited (one year) experience. Basically they are known to sell cheap printers (they do) and charge high prices for ink for those printers (which of course you need great quantities of). Moreover this ink does not last very long. Ok, that's just my experience, decide for yourself, and if you are already owned by Lexmark (I mean you own a Lexmark printer) then you have to buy this ink, so there you go. Enjoy it, it's fine ink."
1,I'd rate it a ZERO if I could,"I was a little curious as to why it was shipping without the box/original packaging, but it was in a the sealed silver package with tape intact. Side by side the old cartridge and the newly purchased look the same with different serial numbers. However, this cartridge DID NOT WORK! It was dried up or clogged and I tried nearly everything to get it to work. These do not work, and while I like to save money I will buy my ink from a real store, and over pay like a chump."
3,Color in the package,"Product is good, but I probably lost a little in transit as when I opened the product there was ink on the inside of the foil. Not sure how much I lost, or if this is normal, but it was alarming as I was concerned that maybe the cartridge was a refill. Seemed to have worked fine, but only tried once on the test page as I didn't have much paper. Will try again, but may be writing back to the seller."
2,cartridge replacement,"I was satisfied with the price and the time of delivery regarding my purchase. However, I think that I am having a problem with either the printer{Lexmark} or possibly with the cartridge. I recently purchased A Canon printer and I hope this will be the last of my print problems."
5,"Great product, slow delivery","The cartridges are great, seem just as good as when I buy them at Staples. The delivery time was a problem. I ordered them the First week of November hoping to have them before Thanksgiving to print pictures for family. the Cartridges didn'come until 4 days after Thanskgiving. Not sure why the shipping was so high for such slow delivery."
2,Not so good,When I print something in color it prints but it doesn't print the right color. It prints as if the color ink has run out. I wouldn't buy any color ink from here again.
1,I felt sick,"Speaking as some who likes wacky music (talking heads, wierd Al) I was shocked and sickened by the music of this band. My borther bought ""hardcore devo"" and there was songs like 'midget' and 'mongolois' that made fun of the challeneged, and 'bamboo bimbo' that was just sick! My brother listens to it and he laughs and laughs. So I give the video one star because that thing in the baby mask really scares me."
4,Makes great tasting coffee!,"We are totally happy with everything about this coffee maker except for the rather small water fill location on the top of the appliance. It's not a huge problem, but if it were slightly bigger there would be less chance for water on the countertop. Just use a little care and it's fine though. Other than that small annoyance, it works great!"
5,Cuisinart DCC100BK,"We use these in our office. We now use a total of four of this model. We love them, they work great, brew fast and are easy to use."
3,3 really dumb design errors,"1. The cord from the coffee maker to the wall plug is *very* short - so forget about pulling it out from the back of the counter to fill it or to read the cup markings (more on that further on) unless it sits directly in front of the power outlet.2. You can barely tip a container of water into the small reservior opening and even if you can you can't empty it because the top's in the way.3. The 2-4-6-8-10-12 cup marks on the water reservoir are *really* tiny, and they are black, the same color as the background. Nearly impossible to read.Whoever engineered this thing ought to be fired."
2,"Just OK, till it started poping and smoking","Got this on sale. Thought it would be a good one.Cone filters not the best.Hard to add water to.Pot drips when pouring no matter what when it is 3/4+ full.Never kept the coffee very hot.Today, after 4 years it started popping and then smoking. My wife unplugged it before it caught on fire...Never overly impressed by it. But now that it potentially tried to burn my house down I would say it is not well engineered or made.We have had other Cuisinart products in the last decade and have to say they don't seem to be holding up nearly as well as Cuisinart products prior.Avoid"
5,Great Coffee Maker,"Purchased for my parents, as they had bought three coffee makers in the last year that were all horrible. I bought the previous version of this coffee maker over 4 years ago for my husband and myself and have been extremely pleased with it. Now my parents are as happy as I am - they finally have a great product that they can depend upon. Now, if only I cold find a good toaster..."
2,I don't like the taste. Too sweet. (Taste Rating Only),"I have used other BioGenesis products with great success. I love the bars and the BioCleanse worked very well. I used Metabol X for the first time today. It was certainly not the worst shake I've tasted, but I don't look forward to tomorrow's shake.The smell reminded me of cake mix, and the taste was ultra sweet. Six hours later, the after-taste is still present.However, because I am a fan of the BioGenesis outcomes, I'll keep drinking until my doctor stops me."
4,Dowco 50008-00,"Bought this for a 2011 flhtk fits very good. for indoor storage, fabric is a little stiff. good price for the product."
5,A GREAT DVD FOR SENIORS,BOUGHT THIS ONE FOR OUR SENIORS AT THE RETIREMENT CENTER. THEY ALL LOVE IT AND THEY LOVE SUNHINE TOO. I JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE THE FIRST IS WORN OUT.
4,A century of work on this problem,"William Kelvin is mostly remembered today for the attachment of his name to the absolute temperature scale, in recognition of his original work on low temperature research in the late 19th century.But during his long career, he investigated many other outstanding problems of the time. One such problem is the subject of this book. The editors chose Kelvin's pioneering paper to kick off the book. They then summarised over a century's effort by selecting papers by other prominent scientists tackling the issue.The book is good for a historical perspective. Though undoubtedly some will be attracted mainly by Kelvin's work."
3,Good if you need it overnight,"It's Grohe, so the quality is first rate, but you can find much better pricing elsewhere. I purchased these because they were the only source that would ship overnight for 3.99, thanks to Amazon Prime."
2,"Kids Vancouver, a book useless to travelers to Vancouver","I bought this book hoping to locate tourest attractions and not so touristy things to do with kids.The book is like a yellow pages for kids with minimal descriptions, lack of concept ideas, or day planning.For instance, the wonderful Stanley Park is covered in less than 1 page. If I didn't know about the Capilano Bridge, a traveler could miss it reading her book. It is covered in the neighbooorhoood section with 1 paragraph.However, if you want to know about the parks or day care in each part of the city, then you have found the book for you."
5,EXCELLENT!,I just love the sound of Carrie's voice! OK Where is the DVD???? I agree with all the previous comments.Just an adorable film. AND Alice Cooper plays at a party!! Now where is the audio of that scene?
4,"Read the Book, never saw the entire movie","I have an old copy of this book (it was my 70 y.o. mother's). I have read it numerous times, and enjoyed it. I love how the book depicts life in Manhattan (I am a native NYer). They never show this movie on cable (I look for it). I saw part of it once on late nite t.v. years ago. I would like to see the entire film, I was a small child when it came out, so I did not get to see it in the theatre. Hopefully they will put it out on a DVD version soon."
4,A Story Worth Retelling,"Walter Lucas delivers an action-packed story while keeping the integrity of the historical account intact. Whether you enjoy western fantasy or historical non-fiction, you're going to love Blood Red River.Billy Dixon realizes that his career as a buffalo hunter may come to an abrupt end, as the natives of the plain threaten to take back the land that belongs to them.Quanah Parker, a young Indian chief is determined to lead a band of neighboring tribes to rid the plains of the white man.Both Dixon and Quanah learn important lessons from this real life experience, lessons that will affect the rest of their lives.Re-live Dixon's famous ""shot of the century"", when he killed an Indian nearly a mile away with his Big 50 Sharps rifle. Read Walter Lucas' Blood Red River."
3,Expensive textbook,"I had to buy this book because it is the required textbook in my class. I bought it here in Amazon because it is cheaper here than in my school's bookstore. Although it is cheaper in Amazon, the book still costs 150+, which is still very expensive for a student like me.Anyways, If I only knew before what I knew now, I could have saved my self $150+! The content of this book is almost very similar to the Smith and Roberson's business law book. I happen to get an older version in a trift store for $25 and while scanning through the book, I realized that the two books are almost the same! The wordings and the case files tackled are almost the same. I hardly even used this brand new book at all.Recommended?If it is really really required in your class and you have money to spare, then go for it. But if not and you dont have much money to spend on text books, I would recommend that you look around at other USED business law text books like the older versions of Smith and Roberson."
2,Not the Best Book Regarding Business Law!,"I'm taking a college course using this book and it is not well written. The author has a bad habit of replacing all the ""his"" pronouns with the ""her"" pronouns -- I see what he's doing but it interfers with the reading of the book.The problems at the end of the chapters are not bad, but the author really gets into legalese and specialized language throughout his chapters that makes reading it a chore as I beat up a dictionary trying to get through it.The glossary is woefully incomplete.Aspen Publishing makes a much superior business law book.Paralegal's Introduction to Business Organizations (Aspen Law & Business paralegal series)"
3,Not Worth the Money,"To be forced to buy this huge (over 1,000 pages) book, then only cover 10-11 chapters in the entire semester is a waste of money and time. The book should be used only in class sessions that consume 2 entire semesters.To only offer a refund of $1.50 for this book is unconscionable. At least 20% of the purchase price should be offered. A $1.50 refund is a refund in name only and is an advertising ploy that takes advantage of the seller."
4,Good condition,"The book arrived on time, and was in good condition. The inside had no markings, but the covered had some dings in it."
2,Condition of Text,"The text was torn. The cover was horrible and it had so much writing in it. It was the wrong text. I typed the IBSN, why would that book show up. I was very disappointed in this purchase."
3,"Maybe, for the inexperienced","This Cd had huge potential, but the Prague slaughtered it. This Cd is good for people who have not heard the original pieces. If you want true music, and power, listen to the original pieces, not re-recorded so so's. For instance, on Riders Of Doom, different lyrics, not as powerful notes, musicians played wrong instruments, at the wrong time, to loud when other ones should have been louder to enhance the power effect. An O.k. CD, but not original pieces. If they would have put the original Pieces on here, then we are talking a ten star cd here, but they didn't, so it is a three."
5,arrived on time and in new packaging,Items arrived on time and in new packaging. The packages were a little sticky and the owner called me to verify that he would make it right and he did follow through on his promise.
3,Travel alarm needs to be larger,"I have an older model, and thought I was buying the same thing again. Guess it pays to read the description more closely! This one is much smaller than my previous one, but is nice for travel as it takes up NO space. But the lighted window is so small I can't read it at night unless I find my glasses. . . that's too much work and then I'm really awake! Even with glasses on, the readout on the screen is a little difficult to read. I'm going to keep looking for the ""perfect"" travel alarm. Stay tuned! Colleen"
5,Practical alarm clock,"Is the best, simple and trustable alarm clock. It is the second we have from time ago. (first goes broke down, but we decided to kept the same product for its simplicity and functionality)"
5,Why doesn't everyone realize how great this band is?!,"I loved this just as much as all their others. To me it ranks right up there with The Lonesome Crowded West. It is a remarkably well put together sounding album, despite the fact that all the songs on it where never meant to be on the same album and where culled from a variety of sources. This album proved to me that Modest Mouse are the most consistently excellent band, song for song and album for album, that I have discovered in the last five years. AND, they're still together, touring, and relatively unknown. Woohoo!"
4,This is one of my favorite albums of the past year.,"I'm not a big fan of sloppy indie rock, but Modest Mouse really draws me in. They're not musical virtuosos, but their music is filled with raw emotion. When I hear them on the radio, I always have to stop talking and soak up their music."
4,Singles make a great album,"The thing I find great about this album is how even though it is a compilation of songs from various singles, and one EP, it still sounds like an album. Every song really does sound like it belongs with the rest. I already liked most of these songs before the album came out, but this has really renewed them in forming them into a single album. I at first expected this to be a nice compilation, but not quite up to the standards of their full lengths, but it really works well, as well as any of their albums."
5,the best ever!,this was my first modest mouse cd ever and i as soon as i started listening to it i got addicted...many times now i get a modest mouse craving and i listen to them all day long. i could listen to it over and over again its great! the moon and antartica cd is also amazing but this one will always have a special place in my heart.
4,A Sublime experience,"From the first song on this album to the last, this is one of Modest Mouse's finest compilations. It takes a few listenings to get into it, but once you do, you will hear this ablum every day. Enjoy!"
2,Not so good,If I were to compile a greatest hits of Modest Mouse I would take track six and track ten from this album...the rest really don't work for me. There are better Modest Mouse albums to buy...don't waste your money.
4,Somewhat something,"I was really looking forward to this release, even though I was completley in the dark about it's nature. I had gathered little rumors and warnings about this band since 97 and had wondered if they could hold up over a whole album. So about 6 months ago I started listening to their albums and wow! I found something special. So when I saw this album coming out I was pleasantly suprised ( and a little tittlated). While good, the problem with this album is it doesn't have the great guitar work for the most part that I was expecting and the harmonies are definetly not working as much as in previous albums ( or more recent, depending on how you look at it). I still think it's a good foot above the heads of other artists, just don't get your expectations to high."
4,Bits and pieces...,"The Mouse has done us all a favor and a disfavor at the same time! On this album you will find bits and pieces from many of MM's hard to find eps, and all cuts are classics. There's only one new song (the first one) but then again... it's gotta be hard to make a living playing good music in the Northwest! You do get the feeling that they are slyly trying to get you to buy the albums the songs are off of... but man if it works... they'll be rich! And wouldn't you rather your money go to the Mouse for recreational purposes and lawyer's fees than to EMI and Warner Bros. fatcats. I say buy it... you won't be sorry and if your a MM fan you'll just have to drink a few more beers and say, ""Damn. I'm not as cool as these guys."" You'll just have to practice more."
1,Building Garbage (Something) Out of Hype (Nothing),"I bought this CD for $1.08 from a church thrift shop and have listened to it several times. Conclusion: I grossly overpaid.This CD is filled with repetitive and consistently bad sounds. Calling this stuff music would be quite a stretch.... tracks 6 and 8 compete ferociously with one another as to which can be more odious and stupid. Track 11 has a few glimmers of quality but, like every other track on this disk, greatly overstays its welcome.Disregard those obscenely misguided 5-star reviews -- they are unforgivably tasteless acts which can only lead more people to buy this horrid record."
3,Minimal pictures,"From the perspective of someone who has served as a museum curator. Full of elegantly written recollections, anecdotes and stories about the well-known names, but not a catalog of pictures."
2,NOT TO BE USED FOR CARPET CLEANING,"I purchased this steam cleaner ten months ago because I adopted a dog with bad habits, so the cleaner was mainly to clean and disinfect my carpet. Prospective customers of the DeLonghi clean steam cleaner should please take note that THIS DEVICE DOES NOT SUCK UP FILTH. THE DEVICE ONLY SPREADS AROUND THE FILTH WITH A HOT WATER SHOOTING SYSTEM. Please take note that steam cleaners, as I understand them, suck the filthy water back into the tank. Such IS NOT the design of the DeLonghi steam cleaner. It shoots hot water only, but has no sucking action to remove the sullied water. Therefore, this is not, despite many valuable uses--cleaning ovens, toilets, drapes--effective carpet cleaning. I wish I had known. At least I can pass on the warning to potential future customers."
1,very disappointing,"After hearing from a friend how wonderful this cleaner was, I purchased it.During the 1st use, I was getting burned by steam coming out of the area where the yellow button is. When I was done, the button was totally out and I was unable to fix it. I called DeLonghi and they said they had to send me a new wand but wouldn't deal with me directly. I called their recommended service center and they said it takes over 6 months to get parts from DeLonghi. It did a good job in the short time I used it."
4,Money Well Spent,"I have a 2300 sf home and most of it is ceramic tile. I live in the country and I have 2 cats and 2 dogs, and a husband and son who like to get dirty in the garage. It was killing my back trying to keep my floors clean. This is easily the best [money] I ever spent... It has made it so much easier on me. My only complaint is that like most cannister appliances, it's easy to tip it over when pulling it. Thankfully, nothing spills, but it would be good if it didn't tip as easily. But hey--I can live with this!"
2,I am a Real person with a Real Review!!!,"I bought this steam cleaner and it worked great on my linoleum floor, but didn't clean well in the bathroom! It didn't clean floor tile grout so I returned this product. If you have lots of linoleum flooring then it is great, but otherwise you will resort to harsher cleaners to get the job done. It is very loud too so invest in earplugs."
5,great cleaner,"This has the power you need to really clean an entire house or apartment. I have had mine for a couple years, and it is so useful for all kinds of tasks. Chandeliers, tile, bathrooms, windows. Really great."
2,Worked great for the short time it worked!,I had this machine for 7 months. While I was using it the yellow button that holds the extension handle on popped off and that let the handle come apart and steam came up in my face and hit my arm. When that happened I threw it. That saved me. I was so disappointed. I had bought mine off of a respected person on ebay that sells everything Delonghi. I tried emailing him for information to send it for repair and never heard anything. Very disappointed!Melissa in KY
3,TEC recommends 2000,Was thinking about getting one of these to clean my bird cages and help with my household chores but them I read that a world bird club called TEC recommends the vapor-systems.com 2000. Apparently a lady there tested all the various models including this delonghi and was dissatisfied with all until she ran into the vapor-systems. I ordered one of them and so far it works like a charm. Hope this helps anyone out there looking at these machines.
3,Carpet Cleaning,"I found the other reviews to be fairly accurate, however, there is an important point missing for pure carpet cleaning. I have used the DeLonghi Steam Cleaner a few times on my carpet. This steam cleaner is not a steam vacuum. So, there is no functional way to get the dirt up once you've loosened it. The way DeLonghi suggests taking care of this is to use a towel that comes with the cleaner. You attach the towel to the end of the steam cleaner attachment, so the steam shoots through the towel. I have to say that this did not work for me. I had to use Resolve carpet cleaner with the steam brush to really get out tough stains. The towel they provided actually stained my white carpet, so don't use it!For steaming other hard to clean surfaces, it's worked fine. But for pure carpet cleaning, the DeLonghi leaves something to be desired."
1,DO NOT use this on Carpets or Upholstery,"Despite the category in which ... places this product, this is NOT a carpet or upholstery cleaner. THIS IS NOT A VACUUM. The unit spits out steam--it has no mechanism for taking up dirt. Using it on a carpet leaves your carpet soaking wet and turns the dirt into mud. Using it on upholstery is worse--how would you get the water out of the couch if there is no vacuum function on this product?The unit heats up water and produces incredibly hot steam. It also spits it out pretty well using the crevice tool. I have used this crevice tool successfully on my outdoor grill, bathtub, venetian blinds, and my car tires. Nevertheless, I still had to go over each of those surfaces with a sponge and soap to clean up the mess that this product leaves behind."
2,There is a difference between steam and vapor.,"I guess I didn't do my homework when I purchased this item. I didn't really understand the differences between steam and vapor, and I didn't understand that I need a system with a super duper vacuum to effectively rid my bedroom mattress and pillow of dust mites..."
2,ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT IN DELONGHI,"With the last DeLonghi product we tried, which was a toaster oven, the timer didn't work. Seems that's the problem once more.There is no way to handle this steam unless you're covered in asbestos.Getting a part replacement from DeLonghi is very much like seeking the Holy Grail."
1,Think Twice.. Vapor-System 2000,"I am in the process of looking for a steam/vapor system. After some research I found that many people like the Vapor System 2000. I just wanted to let people know Vapor-Systems.com doesn't seem like they're really behind their product as great as it may be. I don't know about others, but buying a costly product sight unseen is a risk & I would like to know that I could get my money back if it didn't suit my needs. Vapor Systems offers no return policy (except if it's nonfunctioning). It also took numerous emails to get them to even address this question. For those of you that may assume you can return this product, think twice before buying it. Great thing about Amazon is that they offer customer satisfaction. Now the question is how do I find a steam cleaner that people like!"
3,TPA Impex Is Better But...,This is a solid product. There are better and more expensive alternatives like the steamers manufactured in italy by tpa impex. However the tpa operation in the united states is a mess mostly because the man who heads tpa's business in florida is unbelievably incompetent and hates dealing with customer service things like shipping orders on time and dealing with warranty problems. Nothing worse for a company than an employee who's incompetent and uncaring about customers and has power. So stick with this product and save yourself a headache.
5,"This book is a ""must have"" for youth soccer coaches (U8-U18)","Roy Rees and Cor Van Der Meer have written the best book I've read thus far on the subject of coaching soccer. I've had the book for about 3 years, but I continue to use it as a resource in setting practice objectives, selecting defensive and offensive alignments, developing match strategy, and as an overall guide to improving my soccer program. With the inclusion of real life soccer experiences, both good and bad, I feel as though I've got a personal friend in these author's. They cover it all: how to build a soccer program; managing parents; managing players/disipline; conditioning; teaching skills; teaching tactics; match preparation (including scouting); and, outlining required player attributes for all positions. I assure you, this is money well spent, especially for intermediate level coaches."
5,"Read First Version, am buy this Version","Excellent Read. I am a U11 and U8 coach and this book is writen for High School and College coaching, however, it brings great insight (speeking as a player) that other books do not talk about. Excellent Read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Excellent book, covering soccer coaching from A-Z.",In the past three years of coaching soccer I have read about two dozen books on the topic. This is the best I have found. This book covers some of the topics that I have searched in vain for such as preparing for matches and evaluating players. I recommend it highly.
4,Great thorough covering of the game,"Great book for beginning coaches. I didn't know much about soccer before signing up to be the varsity coach and this really helped me learn more than the basics in a short time or at least let me know how much I still have to learn. I wish it had an easy to understand guide to the rules. Between this and the UEFA website I was able to bluff it. Now, I need to take it to the next level and take a coaching camp.."
5,I Love MASH,"I love MASH. I own all 7 seasons and I can't wait untill seasons 8, 9, 10, and 11 come available, I'll buy them in a flash. I highly recommend."
5,How to Receive without Asking,"This book gives you a Biblical Approach on how to be a good steward of your money. Even though this is more of a booklet, than a book, it is full of good information and would be nice to use as a self-help, or a class material, or even just a reference in regards to finances and money."
1,Don't buy Lexmark,"I have two Lexmark printers and have the same ""clogged, but not empty"" cartridge problem. Not only are the cartridges over-priced, but their customer service is TERRIBLE!! I have contacted them several times RE: the above problem and they tell me that no one else ever has this kind of problem and they assure me that they sell a quality product. Obviously not! Maybe we need to form an organized group of some kind to make Lexmark realize that they do have a faulty product and they do have unhappy customers!! DON'T BUY LEXMARK!!"
2,Inkjets clog and can't be cleaned open,"I liked my Lexmark Z when I first got it; however, after it sat for about 3 weeks, the inkjet clogged. A thorough cleaning freed the blue and red colors, but the yellow (even though it was nearly full) could not be cleaned after several attempts..."
1,leaking cartridge,"opened cartridge packaging and ink had leaked from cartridge. a real mess.I installed cartridge and it works ok albeit with about half the ink remaining. I've always been pleased with amazon, but not this time."
3,Did not work,Did not work. Had problems receiving refund. Contacted Amazon help center and then received a refund.
1,Works great but I got ripped off first by Amazon and a Merchant,This cartridge worked great. I had to order it because an Amazon seller sent me the wrong set and I couldnt get Amazon or the merchant to correct the order. This is the only example of me feeling ripped off by Amazon and I sure wish they would correct the matter.
5,Lexmark 16,It is a good product exactly as expected. I will recommend to anybody using the Lexmark printer. It is worth of the price I paid for .
4,I like it.,"I am very happy with this cartridge. I was afraid it was going to be one of the refilled type, so I was happy to see it was the real thing."
4,Ink at a good Price,"I hate buying ink, it is one rip-off item. You buy a printer for around $100 that does everything but make coffee. Then you have to spend all kinds of money to replace the ink. You end up spending more for ink then the printer in a year. The only thing good about Lexmark ink is it is cheaper then other brands and they have two cartridges (Black & Color) And you don't have to load the color cartridge for the printer to operate."
3,Tips for Unclogging,"Good ink, but I thought I had run out of ink at one point, but the problem was that it was clogged. The ""clean the nozzle test"" didn't work (as usual). So I placed the nozzle holes carefully in warm water for a few minutes. I had a teapot with water boiling. Once I got some steam, I put the bottom part of the cartidge to the steam. Once I saw ""ink beads"" appeared, I cleaned it and right away put them in my printer and printed something. It works well again. So, before you go buy these expensive cartidges, try these tips and see if they will work again."
2,Every one is correct,"What all the other reviewers say is true. The cartridge prints nicely; you do get sharp printing and a very dark black. However, mine has clogged and become useless. It has not run out of ink; multiple cleanings cannot open up those clogged jets. For the price, you'd expect to be able to use the cartridge for a few months, but you can't.Advice? I'll be cleaning the cartridge every few weeks in an attempt to keep those tiny holes running free."
1,Only lasted several months then died,"I added the black cartridge to my Lexmark Z23. Printingwas good for several pages of text. After sitting forseveral weeks, I needed to run the clean routine severaltimes to get rid of the streaking (color has the same problem).After sitting for an another couple of weeks, streaking again.Several cleanings did not fix the problem this time.I will not be replacing these expensive cartridges. My moneywould be better spent on a different printer."
1,poor quality,"this ink is of really poor quality... my printer wont print without a line through the text and it wont print certain colors... green prints yellow, blue prints pink, etc etc... total waste of money... spend the extra money to get a real cartridge..."
2,failure to produce,The ink quality was low and failed to print without making a line through the print. Even when the printer was prompted to use the best quality printing you could still barely read the print. Very disappointed.
4,R. Elliott,"Arrived promptly and is compatible with my printer. I don't know if this is a fault of the product itself or the printer, but I seem to go through them at a tremendous pace, good thing amazon prices are below my local office store's."
4,Will order again.,"I did indeed received the Black Inkjet cartridges quickly enough to avoid ""down"" time printing.I will indeed order more especially the color inkjet.Previous ""refill"" websites, did deliver in a timely fashion, but when it came to using their product, the inkjets did not work no matter what repair was done."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS INK,"I bought this ink from Amazon because the last time when I bought cheaper refillable ink, it dried up quickly. SO i bought from Amazon as the product looked new. THe packaging was new, however the ink was old. I bought the ink in Sept 2010 and did not use daily. My printer reports that my ink is half full however it is dried up and doesn't print. It actually dried up a few months ago, and I am just now writing a reivew about the product. The details should say, product can not be guaranteed to contain fresh ink that will last its full life span."
1,Why was this even written?,This is one of the worst books ever written in the now infamous wrestling autobiography genre. I don't understand why Lita wrote an autobiography. What has she done? Its like I broke my neck so buy my book. This is a useless poorly written book about some girl with a man tattoo who stalks punk bands across the story. It is a very painful read. I don't recommend this book to anyone unless you are a fan of punk band stalkers who write poorly.Seriously I understand that it is a new fad to write a book now. People change their socks these days as fast as they write books and some of them are just pure crap. This is one of them.
1,Inspiring? Great book? Are you guys insane?,"HORRIBLE!!! Very slow, vey boring, and I walked away from this thinking Lita has got to be one of the stupidest people on the planet. Pathetic."
4,Interesting,"The story of Amy Dumas' life so far is a good read. She is someone who has done a fair bit of living and is prepared to follow her dreams whether it is travelling to Mexico to watch the lucha libre to being a role model on WWE.There is a great deal of anger in certain sections of this book, I think she wrote it while she was rehabbing the neck injury and at times, the pain from the injury became pain in words.This is one of the better wrestling books out there, it is not a classic read like Mick Foley's first two books or The Dynamite Kid's book, but Lita's book is very much worth a read."
3,The First Half of the Book Was Good,I'll be perfectly honest I breezed through the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the book. The rest was a slow read. The first and interesting part of the book highlighted her journey to get to the WWE. Her start and journey into the business were highly entertaining. However once she made it to the WWE it seemed like all it was was a night by night account of her happenings for a year. Pretty dull. I struggled to finish it and then gave it to one of my students. I have read almost every wrestling book and all I can say is that it wasn't the worst.
5,Lita: A less traveld R.O.A.D,It was a great book.I am a big fan of lita's and I always wanted and wanted her to write something.I could not put this book down and I reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of Lita.
1,less than a star,I wish I had seen the review before I bought this. The other reviewer is too kind. This is a complete piece of junk. Do not waster your time or money
1,Rip Off Can Crusher,This product should be crush and the people who sells it and Amazon should not let anyone sell junk . Please do not buy this product are any product from anyone that is ripping people off. The company I got the product from should be banned from Amazon.Aluminum Can Crusher 10 Cans 10 Seconds!
5,Most used appliance in my kitchen!,"I love this convection steamer! Cooks large amounts of rice in twenty minutes. (Replaced my rice cooker permenantly, and I would NEVER switch back). We use our cuisinart steamer more than the toaster."
5,Round 3 within a year,"Jeremy came out with stay first, carried me second, and now restored. Stay was the best cd from him and carried me had some great songs on it. Now Restored is new and I got it the day it came out I think that it's not as well as stay but I love and think that most on the songs are radio ""worthy"" - like Take me back, Lay down My pirde, Everytime, Letting go, Breathe, and Thi man. MY desire is good also! my review, get it with you love jermey or with you want to hear a little something different. Or get Stay and great album also."
1,im sorry,"im sorry to say this, having loved his previous two cds, but this was terrible, just terrible. Please do not spend your hard earned music dollars on this. It doesnt have the hard rock edge that ""stay"" had or the range of his worship album. its a comprimise that just doesnt work well. i hope camp learns from his mistake and returns to his roots the next time around."
2,ho hum,"he looks like a tenor, but is really a baritone with a gritty voice. he looks like a nerdy/hip worship leader, but is really a mainstream rocker. The music sounds like Matchbox 20 or Staind or any of the rest of those boring bands that filled the radio between the death of grunge and the birth of indie rock. Everything is by the numbers here, and I see no reason to listen to this album more than once, unless by listening you mean ""putting it on the stereo because noise is better than silence."""
4,good buy,"I have to admit, much like 'Stay,' this album took a few listens before I got into it. I don't know why, but it took me a while to warm up to it.Now that I have warmed up to it, it is a playlist mainstay for me. I think that his writing is what hooks me and it takes me a while to get through the music and into the message ... and the message is powerful."
5,Another great effort!,Another excellent album from the fastest rising star in Christian music. Faithful lyrics and outstanding music. This one hasn't left my CD player for weeks!
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this book. To put it succinctly, it's like a long version of an article in Writer's Digest magazine. Each chapter offers a lengthy (yet basic) description of different specializations but offers little practical advice on choosing one and then breaking into it. (And what if more than one appeals to you? What if they all do?)If you're looking for an overview this book may be for you, but I'd suggest instead buying a book on either nonfiction writing or freelancing that covers specialization in a single chapter (""The Freelance Success Book,"" ""Starting Your Career as a Freelance Writer,"" ""Writing Articles from the Heart,"" etc). It's all you'll really need and you'll get more useful information for your money."
5,Her advice works!,"After reading this book and employing the techniques she recommended, I made my first freelance non-fiction sale...on the first try. Since then I've dogeared and highlighted this book, which has lead to more than ten assignments and a solid beginning to my freelancing career.Thanks, Kelly, for a great book!"
4,wonderfully melodic,"It is hard to describe the combined work of three such eclectic artists. One listen to their version of Rocky Top will define it all in two words - WONDERFULLY MELODIC. Grass - blue, new or retro - never has sounded better."
3,Old-Timey,"Caveat emptor - I b'lieve you must love old-timey music to love this CD. It's very low-key and almost lackadaisical in execution. No hot solos, no impassioned singing so country or bluegrass only fans should steer clear. That said, it has much charm and humor. My favorite: Seeger's version of Dylan's ""Maggie's Farm."""
2,"Retro, Alright","Grisman and Hartford are old favorites of us ""Smothers Brothers""-era folk but this album is so 'retro' it is almost a musical joke. John Hartford always had severe limitations as a vocalist and someone on this album is even worse! This harks back to the days when mountain folk were either ""pickers"" or ""singers"" but rarely both. ""Memphis"" and ""Maybelline"" have vocals so primitive in style and so limited in vocal range as to be amusing rarities. I had hoped this talented group would start with great Chuck Berry material and give it scorching bluegrass picking. The treatment here is bare bones and the high point of ""Maybelline"" is a jaws harp twang. If this album isn't just self-indulgent, it is mainly for musicians and insiders in the genre."
2,"Someone out there may like this,,,not me","Long time Grisman fan, not a fan of this recording. I got excited when I saw the track list but it just didn't live up my expectations. The vocals are poor. If you like old-time music this is your thing!"
4,Great for those curious about crusing the Inside Passage,"This self-published memoir of an Inside Passage cruise from Puget Sound to Alaska is excellent. Power boating accounts are rare. This allows the author and reader to focus on the trip rather than technique. Jess Webb entertains as he educates, recounting the rewards and hazards adeptly. This book deserves more visiblity."
3,Good Overview.,"Concise and clearly written, Under Two Flags is a good review on the Navel engagements fought during the Civil War. It is at once an interesting overview for knowledgeable students of the war and a very good introduction to those unfamiliar with this dimension of the conflict. Fast paced, easily read, there are passages and fascinating history I have found nowhere else.Covering confederate raiders, the river campaigns, the blockade and the various assaults upon Confederate ports by combined Union Navy and Army amphibious operations, Fowler delivers a very even handed discussion of this often forgotten aspect of the war. This is worth your time!"
3,"Solid, but not gripping","A reasonably concise and well written account of the naval side of the civil war. If you want a good overview of the conflict this will fit the bill and while it flows along (no pun intended) and is quite readable, it is never gripping the way other books about war sometimes are."
