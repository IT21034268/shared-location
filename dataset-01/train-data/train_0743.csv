3,Detailing the details slows the book down.,I grew up on boats on the Great Lakes and now have a home in Florida and in neither place have I found my self in a culture of speaking in Brand Names. I was relieved when the author began to drop that affection and began to focus on telling the story. An otherwise interesting beach read.
2,Unintentional comedy.,Seychelle Sullivan manages to escape more life or death situations than James Bond! She seems to be unbelievably smart for a salvage boat captain. The fact that she can outwit most die-hard criminals makes this book comical. Terribly far-fetched plot.
5,I want more books like this one,"Surface Tension is well researched and well written. I noticed just a couple of typos, but overall, the editing was good. Character development was just right and, as in real life, it took a while to get to know the players. If there were any boring sections, I didn't notice. Lots of action and twists kept it interesting. I'm ready for the next episode."
4,Surface Tension,"I am a hard-to-please suspense novel reader. I thought I'd try this book because I love Florida backdrops. I really enjoyed the book. Enough so that I have just ordered ""Cross Current"" by this same author, Christine Kling. I can smell the coconut oil already..."
5,Surface Tension,"For her first novel, I thought this was a great read. I lived in Florida for almost 20 years and found Ms. Kling was extremely accurate in her diescriptions of the various places in and around Ft. Lauderdale. The novel held my interest and was suspensful, her characters believable. I am looking forward to more books from Ms. Kling"
1,Gave up on this one,"This is the 2nd book I tried by Ms. Kling, I couldnt finish the other one either. I love nautical fiction/mystery/suspense books, so I wanted to like this.Its clear she really knows sailing, but too much time is spent telling us about tying knots, the rigging & lines, ok I get the point, you are an experience sailor. But get on with the story already.I had to spend so much energy forcing myself to read each line that I lost the point of the story. I finally gave up about a 1/4 in to it.In contrast, I immediately started a different book & it grabbed me from the start."
4,Great start to a new series,"Surface Tension is currently a free download on Kindle- I've had mixed results with those, but the reviews persuaded me to give it a try, and I am so glad I did. The writing is excellent, the pacing is just right, and the storytelling is superb. The characters are finely drawn and sympathetic (at least the ones you're supposed to care about!). I know very little about boats, but I learned a lot from the story as the author is clearly an expert. I'm already looking forward to her next book- and NO, I don't know this author. I'm starting to feel like every other review I read is written by a friend of the author, especially for the free Kindle downloads."
3,Good start to a new series,"I tried this book as a free download, and enjoyed it. The main character was easy to sympathize with and the pace was good. Not the most suspenseful book I've read, but I would still recommend it as an easy read, and I will try others in the series. Florida location was fun. A few typos here and there, but otherwise well edited and formatted."
3,Lots of Action,Gritty leading lady that you want to root for. Interesting plot but a bit drawn out. Worth reading for sure.
4,Evil Treasure,This is a spirited tale of evil and the triumph of good set in the world of boat people and evil crooks in the waters of south Florida where it is not always easy to tell them apart.
4,Pleasing Mystery,Surface Tension is a solid mystery for a debut novel. It has an engaging lead character in Seychelle Sullivan. I was guessing with this one until the very end. I will read the next novel based on my reading of this one.
4,Enjoyed complex plot and interesting characters,I enjoyed the complex plot and interesting characters. The book was a page turner that often I coulod not put down. Also the book had good detail on the diving business.
1,surface tension,This book didn't hold my attention. The plot didn't develop early enough in the book to keep me involved. Good premise though.
5,Surface Tension is a keeper,"A great book to get lost in for a few sweet hours. Nicely written and, just as important, nicely edited - no stumbling over misspellings and lousy grammar as I find too often in the low-price samplings for Kindle. Good story and Seychelle is wonderfully likeable new protagonist - go for it!"
4,great read! enjoyed it very much!,"glad i read this! it had just the right amount of suspense, mystery and humor! i think it has a great story line and very well written! i would definitely try other books by this author!"
1,"Really, really dumb ""heroine""","Seychelle Sullivan has got to be one of the dumbest ""heroines"" ever created. This book is written like Christine King found every single bad cliche for a woman she could find and put them in the series. I was interested in the premise until I was about half-way through the first book. Holy tug boats, Batman! EVERY cliche you can think of. Yes, I finished it but won't buy another. Don't waste the money, cheap as it is."
3,Entertaining Read,"Not that this isn't junk fiction (about the only fiction I read), but that being said, Surface Tension is a fun mystery thriller. Better characters than the average for this type of novel, and a story I didn't figure out just as soon as the conflict was described. There is ample development of the salvage and underwater workings of a person living on the Florida coast that lends a good sense of reality to the story. Also on the good side is that I did not feel compelled to read the entire novel in one sitting (another usual failing I have), so I was able to be entertained for about a week. I have already put the next book in the series on my wish list. Only gave it 3 stars because it is still junk fiction. ENJOY!"
4,Surface Tension,"Wow! This story took me for a ride, clinging on with my fingernails at every twist and turn. Carrying me deep into the black tunnel of cruelty, greediness of the dark side of our society. I felt as if I was there, swimming, diving and holding my breath and fighting for my life. Again all I can say is WOW! I will be reading more books written by Christine Kling and I want to say thank you for such a great story."
3,to technical,"I was an ok book. It was to technical for me, but it was ok. Boating people that know about boats and diving and water stuff would like it."
1,no support!,"I would love to say how this product performs, but we are unable to get it to download onto our computer. We got the demo CD downloaded, but the actual product.....no way. What CADpro fails to say in their ads is, there is ZERO tech support! They have a fax number to use and an email address, but they do not answer them! The only number we could find is if you are having trouble ordering. So, if you have money to throw away and no real use for a CAD program, let me suggest this one! Their online forum only takes you to an order form to sign up for their newsletter. I am not at all pleased with this!"
2,Look for something else,"Maybe I'm spoiled at work with AutoCad and Visio 2007, but I think this piece of software really needs work. I bought it to use as a item to do light work for home projects. The library looks as though an 8 year put it together.I realize that for what it costs it wasn't going to be much, but this program really lacks. If this is what you get for the price I would look around for something else. I bit the bullet, put this on the shelf, and swung for Visio for my home projects. Hopefully, I can keep Visio going for some years to come.It's too bad. My suggestion for anyone wanting to buy this dollar value level of software? Try before you buy. I wish I had."
3,Great book - if you can suspend disbelief...,"I want to start by saying I really enjoyed this book. However, as in his other books, some of the technologies he claims are true simply don't exist. In the case of deception point, most of the advanced technologies he refers to only exist as powerpoint presentations being used by some overly ambitious engineers to justify increases to their program budgets. The technologies simply aren't as advanced as Mr. Brown would have you believe. If you can get past that, it's a great read, with lots of excitement."
3,Starts good and gets better but ends poorly.,"No spoiler herein. Dan Brown is a skilled author and this is no attack on him. The book is entertaining and I had trouble putting it down after the half way mark. However, I began to sense Dan's person politic persuasion with regards to America's two major political parties. Towards the end of the book, when the riddles are being solved - it becomes more and more uncomfortable for those readers that hold opposite political beliefs from Mr. Brown. Those that hold allegance to Dan's political party will love the conclusion. Those that hold opposite political beliefs will feel cheated and frustrated. Notice that I am not attacking DAn's story telling ability - it is terrific. Actually, I'd love to read another one of Dan's books - but I will make sure it doesn't contain personal political contamination before I buy."
4,Is it coming to pass ?,"I was lent this book for reading during a vacation, and did find it absorbing. I 'was' warned about his 'formula' method of writing, but the elements were extraordinary enough to keep my attention throughout the entire book.But now, I see this...[...]My question is, are there really 'ice guns' ??"
2,Plot Evaporates And Wilts As You Read!,"Initially this book grabs you with its developing storyline. However, the author doesn't hold it together. As you read, it becomes more and more obvious that the author did not really know what to do with his story or his characters.I finished the book, but it took some work on my part, because half way through the story telling of Mr. Brown does not hold up. If I was the editor of this book, I would have sent Mr. Brown back to work on making it a completebook, and not coasting on its intesting beginning & premise!Its too bad, because it could have been a decent read. I rated it a 2 on the overall premise of the story and the beginning. All and all, I think Mr. Brown was just writing a movie script and not a book."
2,It feels like eating fast food,"This is the second book I read from Brown and it feels like we are about to get a book factory. Even though the book is a nice read, far away from being boring it leaves you plain after you finish it. It feels like eating fast food - feels good while you are eating, and then dull when you are finished. The only way how to get rid of this feeling is to get another book from Brown and read it. The problem might happen if you finish all four before he writes fifth.To be a bit more specific, what I really don't like about this book is that so many technical facts are either irrelevant, or not accurate. And this can be very annoying if you know even a little bit of engineering. However, what I like about it is that it take so little to finish reading it...and then another BROWN can be taken for read."
3,This is an above-average book . . .,". . . but 3.5 stars is not an option.The good - you won't be able to resist the plot. This book moves fast. Brown spins a yarn that you just have to pull from the sweater to see where it leads.The bad - Hmmm. It isn't exactly realistic. If you're looking for Tom Clancy, this ain't it. It doestand above Clive Cussler's books on the realism scale but then again, so does Harry Potter at times. :)Do I recommend it? Yes. Is it the best novel ever? No.Another book like this that I recommend - similar speed & government/military/technology thriller - is 'Icefire' by the Reeves-Stevens team."
3,Over the top,"Dan Brown writes ok. No more, no less. To write a book on the topic of a possible child of christ Da Vinci Code was a smart plan and gave mr Brown much fame. But don't be mistaken. His books are by far no literature. Nice reads though! Deception Point has a nice storyline. Several parts of the book could be skipped and do not offer anything to the main plotline. The boat scene at the end of the book is written completely over the top. The only thing I missed was a giant Yeti coming from the water to rescue everybody ;-).Do I recommend this book?Yes, it's a nice read when you're on a holiday, in the train or airplane.No, not a very good example of interesting style, vocabulary a.s.o."
1,Arrant Rubbish,"Brown's success with The Da Vinci Code made his name. However not having read that book yet, I thought I'd try this one first. It is a cheap pastiche of (bad) science fiction, political machinations, and conspiracy. Exciting enough in a pulp fiction sense but far too much extreme heroism and contrived suspense.Having now read The Code, it by contrast deserves its popularity. I'm left with the view that Brown is a one-book wonder.Don't disappoint yourself with this book."
2,Not as sophisticated,"It's easy to tell this is one of Brown's earlier efforts. The characters are more broadly drawn, some of the science is (now)familiar with most adults over 21, and the dialogue is simple."
4,Worth your time,This is a Dan Brown book but has a feel of a James Patterson book. It is a typical scandal in politics and as it unravels it is even more scandalous. I thought it was enjoyable and had some interesting information about space and the ocean that will give you some educational value. I enjoyed it a lot but wouldn't classify it as a best ever.
3,Not his forte,"This is a good book, but not so much when you compare it to his religious thrillers. He does much better in Angles and Demons and Da Vinci Code than this one. Yet is is still a good book."
3,A fun mindless read,"As with The Da Vince Code, a suspension of reality is absolutely necessary to get through this fast paced thriller. Read it the way you might watch some Hollywood blockbuster film. The characters suit their purposes well, though are not very deep. I liked the continuous action and the plot unfurled nicely for the most part. I found myself laughing aloud two or three times when something absurd happened to get the story out of the corner it was drawn into in the name of building excitement.All in all, I wasn't impressed, nor was I disappointed in having spent the time. Hence the 3 stars."
3,He did better..,I found Deception Point not as good as Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code & Angels & Demons. It does get better about three quarters through the book. I guess that not every book can be on top.
3,"3.5 stars. thrilling, but predictable.","upside: classic dan brown style of writingdownside: classic dan brown style of writingmy third dan brown book (DVC and A&D). those familiar with dan brown's style will recoginize that once again he uses the same ""formula"" to produce a high-pace, intellectual thriller. but that formula feels a bit old now leaving the ending entirely predictable. heres the outline:step 1: introduce a mysterious deathstep 2: begin to outline the plotstep 3: introduce the mysterious unknown bad guy behind everthingstep 3: introduce the hero with specific specialtystep 4: introduce the hero's love interest with specific specialtystep 5: continue on the plot and tie in mysterious deathstep 6: introduce the major twiststep 7: hero and love interest make outstill a worthwhile read though. so if you have the time to enjoy it, pick it up. if there are others books on your list, read those first."
3,Dan Brown's weakest effort by far,"""Deception Point"" is not an out and out loser but it leaves a lot to be desired nevertheless. The plot is preposterous, the writing clumsy, and the book's political thread painfully ill-informed.Despite its weaknesses, ""Deception Point"" is an exciting tale that often had me on the edge of my seat. The action sequences in the Arctic and at sea are particularly effective. Still, this book falls far short of the high standard Brown set in ""The Da Vnci Code."""
4,"Fascinating ""what if"" story","I found Deception Point quite by accident, never having read any of Dan Brown's work before. I was intrigued by the premise, and decided to give it a go. Don't be mislead by the synopsis on the back cover of the book. It suggests that the book consists largely of a ""bug hunt"" across the arctic ice, but this is not the case. There is a lot of military hardware, political intrigue and scientific discovery. Top it off with a female protagonist who takes no bull... from anybody, and I'm sold!I gave the book four stars because in my mind a five star rating only applies to the greatest of all novels, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Those are few and far between and that takes nothing away from Brown's work. Deception Point was a lot of fun to read, and I'd recommend it to anyone!"
3,Mr. Brown is not a fact checker,His description of the LA class submarine made it clear to me that he had never been on one. As a former crewmember of a LA class boat the made-up insides were funny. How can I believe he knows the super secret weapons exist if he did not do the simple thing of visiting one of the boats?
3,a lame end to a good start,"With no exception, Dan Brown has once again spoilt a good plot. As the book gets nearer to the 'climax', boredom sets in. Any reader who has read atelast one of his books can predict with pin point accuracy who was the mastermind behind the deception. I was sure of who the culprit was after reading 5 pages or so, hoping against hope this would not be so predictable. The books starts well but we could do without the banal 'romance' and other cliches that were put in it for the inevitable book-to-movie blockbuster.But still, its fun to read the book. You can easily skip some pages that will surely bore you and just read the good part without missing a beat."
1,Liberal bias!!!,"I assumed when I bought this book I was purchasing a novel with a story line that would entertain me along with stretching my imagination... you know ...a novel. Nope, not what I got! What I got was a never ending, liberal bias view of his definition of any and all Republicans. His bias is both trite and infuriating. After less then 100 pages I threw the book out. I'm out eight bucks, but my gain was I now know to never buy another Dan Brown book."
1,Dan Brown's Worst Book,"Ahhh, I didn't really like this book. It didn't really interest me in any way. I didn't really find the characters that cool or identifiable (b/c I don't know anyone in politics). Anyway, I kind of just skimmed some of the book, b/c I could care less about some of the ocean biology and technology they have down there. Just not that interesting to me, and Dan Brown's books are becoming to formulatic to me (I've read all of them). I don't think I like this author anymore. It's cheap thrills, and I don't get anything out of them."
3,Very fast and captivating,"This book sucks the reader in and doesn't let go. Plausibility defines CAN it happen, not is it LIKELY to happen...which means that this plot is possible. Obviously this book is not rich with literary merit, however it is perfect for the pleasure reader that likes to become mesmerized by action and suspense, and enjoys the mystery of details being unraveled a little at a time. The author did as he intended...entertained."
4,Another winner of the same style.,"After reading ""Angels & Demons"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"" I went looking for more. Dan Brown has a writing style that keeps you in suspense and has you always wanting to read just a few more pages. ""Deception Point"" was almost as good, but when I was through I couldn't help but feel as though his writing is a little formulaic. All in all, still a great read."
4,Great Action Thriller,"This was great, Dan Brown kept me on my seat always wanting more. The story is very interesting...there is science, politics, betrayel, mystery, everything really. The only downer was I figured out the bad guy way before they were revealed and when they were revealed it wasn't all that spectacular. Other then that, it was a great read."
4,Deception Point is pur Dan Brown,"It turns out I had already read Deception Point some time ago - before I rsead the DaVinci Code. His plotting is superb, his overall writing style pure delight. You won't be sorry you bought Deception Point."
4,Good read,I enjoyed reading this book. Nice quick read for summer vacation. They gave away too much on the back cover and therefore it was a bit predictable. I still liked it
4,Election Thriller,"""Deception Point"" started with horrific excitement. The author, Dan Brown, kept you guessing what was going to happen next. There was no shortage of surprises, twist and turns surrounding the senator running for the presidency. His daughter is constantly challenged with hair raising events that will keep you trying to protect her.The staff of the president exploits their positions in unusual ways to help gain another four years in office.Is the president a participant in the events? You have to read the book to find your answers, enjoy!"
5,"Great author, great book, great gift",My mother is a big fan of Dan Brown's books. He causes you to think 'What if'. I got this book for her as a gift and she is loving it.
3,More Filler than Thriller,"I am a fan of Brown's, and his other three books managed to suspend disbelief even with incredible plot lines. Deception Point, however, has the feel of a work rushed to print to take advantage of the buzz created by the DaVinci Code. The book suffers from too many caricatures instead of characters. Ordinarily, the reader could get past this (and simply ignore the hokey and transparent character descriptions), but a good many of these folks are important enough to the plot to call for more than two-dimensional treatment. While the premise is interesting, and the story is structured to create the suspense that one expects from Dan Brown, this lack of character development detracts from the satisfaction that comes from really being ""taken in"" with a surprise ending. (Take, for example, ""The Poet"", by Michael Connelly). The resolution has an arbitrary feel as a result. Bottom line: worth a read, but not a re-read."
4,Not better the DaVinci but still better then most,Ok I am one of those people who read The DaVinci Code because of all the hype surrounding the book. Of course I loved it and starting reading all of his other books. This one has a lot in common with his other books but it is still a good quick read. Well worth the time and money.
2,will not buy again,"Make sure you ask for pictures of the item as ""brand new"" does not mean it is in ""brand new"" condition. the book I received stated it was ""brand new"" and was ripped, the pages were turning yellow. obviously not brand new condition."
4,one of the best mysteries,"This was one of the best mysteries I've read. I read a lot of mysteries, but this was the best I,ve read in a long time."
1,Deception Point,"To sum up this book in one word ""brutal"" comes to mind. Dan Brown did not follow-up Angels and Demons ( which I found to be the best) and DaVinci Code well at all. The story is boring, the characters are boring, and worst of all the whole thing is very predictable."
1,Regarding Deception Point,"One evening, after exploring the natural and man-made wonders of Cappadocia, my solitary musings were interrupted, with some frequency, by the spirited reading of the choicest excerpts of Deception Point. The reader, a fellow traveler, simply could not savor the vapid, vacuous and utterly charmless prose of Dan Brown alone. Given the laughs which ensued, I'm glad he refused to spare the rest of us. But then, my dear reader, that does not mean that you should not spare yourself."
1,"Gag, gag, gag","If you know anything about technology and how to develop a good password, then read this for the comical value. This book reminds me of a B-rated movie. Starting with the plot, and the now expected lack of character development, the whole book as a piece of writing is unbelievable. The lack of facts just follows course.This was my third Dan Brown book. Each one came recommended by someone who knew of my love for reading and was just convinced that this was worth my time. Dan Brown goes after conspiricy ideas, twisted facts, and claims of just trying to get people to be more aware. Take all that away and what is left is that Dan Brown cannot write. The plots fall apart, the characters are lacking, and there is nothing to sustain the finish.Thanks, Dan Brown, for again making me so grateful that there are other authors to read. Because those other authors are who I am going to read from now on. Three books in a row that were just aweful was enough waste of my time."
1,A mess,"After reading Davinci code I was full of hope in finding some more good reading in this novel. Well, it started out quite good (if you are good at suspension of disbelief) but later you cannot go on any further.The characters are pathetic, the story line poor, the details and data used wrong and pathetic. Well, I kept on reading until about half way, saying to myself `it cannot get worse, it has to start picking up now'. Well, no, it did not. It went from bad to worse. How it ended I don't know as I could not force myself any further.So if you are looking to buy this, please, please stay away. Read the DaVinci code and call it a day.I see some people give it 5 stars, well I suppose that just goes to show - it takes all kinds .....Well, what can I say. I am just being honest."
1,dreadfully mundane and far too contrived,"and as you might imagine, predictable. Brown's gotten better since he started writing, but for me, I couldn't wait to finish. Bad dialogue, too cliche, and remarkably boring. He has better reads, so start with them."
3,Great service got here fast,But i did not like the story. I guess I was expecting an old fashion type of Stephen King type of book like The Shining or something......guess I shouldve done my research. Oh well live and learn
3,Da vinci code this is not.,"Dan Brown is definitely the king of the ""smart novel"". There is definitely alot of ""jargon"" in this book. Most of it geology. While I'm not sure how much of it is legit and how much isn't, I am certain that it made this novel harder to enjoy.Spoiler Alert:There's alot to do with chrondules. Don't know what chrondules are? Me neither, and it could seriously effect how much you enjoy this book.It's written similar to the other Dan Brown novels. Trying to keep you on the edge of your seat with vague references to events that will completely revealed one piece at a time. This was done much better in the Da Vinci Code, and only medicore in this book.It was enjoyable, but certainly not a must read."
4,Deception Point,"I read Angels & Demons by Dan Brown and read his preview of Deception Point, cleverly installed in the back of Angels & Demons. After reading that first installment I went immediately to Amazon and ordered Deception Point. I just finished it and loved it! It was definitely a thriller with plot twists and turns with every page. If you liked Angels & Demons, you'll love Deception Point, too."
5,Pot- Boiler on Ice,"Dan Brown keeps the plot moving at a blistering pace. The set up time for the next action sequence is short. The pause in action is just right, he gives the reader only enough time to catch his breath and then blasts off again. He does not get bogged down in endless sub-plots like Tom Clancy tends to do (although Clancy's plots are more plausible). You don't have to skim through Dan's book to try and pick out only the good stuff. In fact you don't want to miss a single sentance. It is all good.I recommed it to anyone who is looking for a good thrill."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This book was OK as a beach vacation page turner. Is is a thriller, but not nearly as good as the Da Vinci Code, which I loved despite the hokey dialogue between the two protagonists. Like the Da Vinci Code, Deception Point contains hokey dialogue, but it's so bad that it detracts from the storyline. It's just not credible and certainly not realistic. Dan Brown needs to work on dialogue. Also, the plot twists and ending are clever and surprising, but so strained that they go beyond the intended surprise ending and are just plain silly. Bottom line: don't buy this book, but if you're stuck somewhere with not much else to read and some time to kill, it's mostly entertaining, but not great."
3,Similar,"This book is a disappointment after The Da Vinci Code, but reading it will give you more insight on Dan Brown's writing style. His most adventurous book, it involves much more action than his other books. Still suspenseful and mysterious, it follows the same general plot as his other books."
4,Very nice!,"I really enjoyed Deception Point. The story grabbed me, and kept my interest the whole way through. This is my third Dan Brown novel, and I have yet to be disappointed. What is amazing though, is the descriptions of the Spec Ops! To think, we really have these kind of guys working behind the scenes! Amazing! I take on The DaVinci Code next; I already have my paperback version for at home, and the unabridged audio for the drive to work!"
3,"Oh, Please!!!","This novel has a good characters and a great plot, but the author goes too far and tries to be another Tom Clancy and spoils the book by not doing his homework.For whatever reason, Dan Brown tries to describe technology that he has ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE about.Case in point: a Los Angeles class submarine does not have two reactors, nor does it have a super secret sound isolated conference room. It wasn't even necessary to the plot to add that kind of detail. There are many other instances of the same techno-silliness that distract the reader.While many of the things he talks about are factual, he destroys his credibility with sheer nonsense that wasn't even necessary.The book is still worth reading, but he should do a bit more research on subjects he's weak in."
2,Big Disappointment,"This book was a letdown compared to Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code. The characters weren't fleshed out and theplot was ridiculous. Borrow this book, don't buy it!"
3,Predictable,"After reading ""the da vinci code"" and ""angels and demons"" i found this book a little bit predictable. I think this book is good, but the plot is really absurd (at the end at least) and if you've read dan brown's books you know that you will expect a twist at the end (a predictable one in this case). I do enjoyed the book, but it didnt shocked me.The spanish version of the book was published before angels and demos and the da vinci code. I would have loved the book if i hadnt read those 2 before."
4,a jaw dropping ending,"a brilliant piece of work by dan brown, but after reading the da vinci code and angels and demons i wasnt surprised. there are many exciting parts in the book and a brilliant ending to finish it off. even though it took me a little longer to read, it was well worth it."
5,Yet another great find with Dan Brown,"I stepped off the normal sure-thing author wagon again on the chance that I might discover a new fresh storyteller and with Dan Brown I was not disappointed. A story involving satellites, the military and top secret stuff always gets my nod as the foundation for a great read. I can report that it was a good read and I will keep the author on my go to list...."
4,Dan Brown is on target,"This is my first review involving Audio Books . . . . LOVE IT! As for my review, 'Deception Point' took a little longer than the other Dan Brown Books did to get me hooked. All the many names, places, issues were a bit confusing, but Dan did what he always does and grabs you and holds you to the very end. Another issue was that 3/4 in I knew who did it, I just had yet to learn how. Usually I am surprised in the end, this one not so much, but Dan Brown can really write, and I enjoyed the book."
3,fun but average thriller,"While this book definitely doesn't rise above the genre in the way that Angels and Demons & The Da Vinci Code do, it's a solid page turner.Anyone who has ever read a book before will figure out the final plot twist at least 100 pages before it happens, and, as in Da Vinci Code, you do have to work somewhat hard to suspend disbelief at certain points - particularly in a couple of passages where allegedly brilliant scientists express shock and disbelief upon learning about trivial scientific facts of which any reasonably educated person is aware.The action set-pieces are well-written and often quite ingenious, and, as usual, Brown's background research is quite good, if a bit sensationalized. If you don't expect another Da Vinci Code, and just want a fun thriller to waste a few hours with and maybe learn an interesting fact or two, you'll like this book."
4,Entertaining read!,"This book is a great read! While I agree that some of it seems a bit implausible if you stop and study it, I never found myself having a hard time believing it or being immersed in the book. I read this one quickly - in about 2 days - and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mystery. Towards the end of the book you figure it out, and I personally wouldn't have given away as much info as the back cover does, but overall a great read, especially if you buy the paperback (which is only $7 or so).I gave this book 4 stars because 5 stars means the book is darn near perfect and I reserve that rating for MUST-READ books.If you're looking for a few other books, try PREY and/or THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN by Michael Crichton - I just got through reading PREY and it's pretty good too, and TAS is a classic."
3,Not as good as the hype....,"somewhat predictable, but fast moving and enjoyable....I liked the book, but not as good as A&D...."
2,Soap in a book - bed reading,"This book didn't have me ""so hooked I couldn't put it down"" was more of - a couple of chapters before lights out.Main Characters reminded me of Sunset Beach (the soap opera).Gabriel Ashe & Rachel Sexton should have had a fight over a man or two, shame the only contender was Michael Tolland who seemed like a bit of a wimp (or wet fish)He could have done with a sinister side to make him more interesting.I liked the escape from the bad guys across the ice & the way emergency code was picked up by the sub. The megaplume & description of all the rock minerals got a bit boring.One star for the snowy location/Nasa theme.And One for making me smile/interested enough to buy another book - as it was light hearted action/adventure that didn't keep me awake."
1,YEAH RIGHT! Give me a break,"Too many bodies to begin with. They drop like flys in this book! Implausible plot. This was my first/last Dan Brown bookMay I recommend ""The Price of Honor"" by David H. Hackworth."
2,Servicable fiction,"This book is a thriller/conspiracy book that involves NASA and a mysterious meteorite in Greenland. It has a relatively good story, however if you have a problem with plot holes, this is a book to steer clear of. If you don't know much about or don't care about the way the US government and military works, this book won't be bad. Several things that are key to the plot, and several that aren't, detract from the author's work. For one, the basis of the entire book is shock and frustration that NASA is spending $15 billion a year. Unfortunately, this is a miniscule portion of the government's budget, and shouldn't shock anyone. Then there are the myriad of improbable to impossible technologies, along with minor details that make it apparent the author didn't quite research everything he should of. Overall, its a good story with lots of little details that really get in the way."
3,contrived but topical and relevant,"The plot line is among the less believable of Dan Brown's published works. However, the overall debate in the novel regarding the future of NASA is very relevant to current thinking regarding NASA. So, if you're looking for a great Dan Brown thriller this one will be a bit slow, but it may cause you to think about the politics and potential privatization of the space program or major elements of the space program. These issues are being debated and will continue to be debated in congress and in the public over the coming years."
1,Don't let this loser dumb you down!,"Dan Brown has found his niche in hypothetical conspiracy theories. I read Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, I enjoyed them (like enjoying a Big Mac) even though I felt like he had violated the ""suspention of disbelief"" code. But when I read Deception Point I felt like I was dealing with a dangerous level of ""dumbing down.""Dan Brown's true niche is in exploiting the paranoia of the uninformed. I had laughed at the idea that Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code would probably keep the Vatican on its toes for a while. I figured, they're going to be working overtime to keep the conspiracy theories at bay. But I'm not laughing now because he's developed a huge cult following. Deception Point's anti-science paranoia is not funny at all in that context.Read this book and think not about advanced science/political conspiracies but about the altruistic nature of science and the self-serving needs of pulp fiction marketing."
4,Good Book,"Not his best of his line of work. However, Dan Brown is very good at telling stories and letting you get involved with the plot."
3,A Page Turner But Lacks Punch,Not my favourite Dan Brown book but has its moments. I found the technical explanations too cumbersome and the 'deception' is played out for far too long.Still it has some moments of great intrigue and some well spun action.I feel that I took too long to read this one which didn't help.Overall quite satisfying but could have been so much better.
3,Enjoyable Read,"This is the 4th book I've read by Dan Brown and it was an enjoyable read but was not my favorite. Some parts of the book were very predictable, such as during the press conference by Senator Sexton to expose the conspiracy he was distracted by his daughter Rachel while the evidence in white envelopes where swapped out. The main antagonist however was a surprise to me so that prevented this book from being a failure. Overall this was an enjoyable book to read but in my opinion, Angels and Demons is still Dan Brown's best work as of to date.3.5/5 stars."
2,Brown goes beyond 'the point' on this one,"As a number of reviewers have pointed out in detail, this book has factual flaws and flights of fancy which take it well beyond the normal limit to suspension of disbelief. Some similar, but less jarring, flaws are to be found in his better known books.My ranking for this book reflects my personal reaction. I'm not suggesting that I isn't an enjoyable read on some levels, but . . . 3 stars would mean ""I like it"", I must choose ""2 stars' ""I don't like it""."
1,terrible,"This book is terrible. Shallow characters, twists just for twist's sake. Even the science and hardware are pretty boring. Just feels like he mailed it in."
1,"Weak, shallow, predictable....not worth the money","Not even close to the ""A"" grade thrillers such as produced by Coonts, Coyle, Thor, etc. Trite, contrived, a very long stretch by Brown. He's a ""B"" grade author. This is the last book of his I'll read."
2,Not in the league of Da Vinci Code!,"Dan Brown's second novel, Deception Point, is definitely better than the disastrous ""Digital Fortress"". But you can still see the flaws that the first novel suffered. He has found a better subject and tied in the multiple plots neatly. However his dialogs between the characters especially between the scientists are painfully shallow and the sarcasm is totally unnecessary. Unrealistic scientific and political events is another matter but can be bearable."
5,Story Behind Politics,"Want to know what a really cool book is? Want to be decived in a book? This is the book you should get!. Its a really cool story..or i would say Cold one up north. Its about how NASA tries to stay in one piece and also keep the president in power. Lots of blunder and backstabbing. The person you never knew would do it is the clue to it all. Reading this book makes u feel like you're in it, every feeling seems so real, like you're there, even the atmophere is seems so real, the pain and emotions. That what i call a thriller, like a roller coaster!."
3,Nice way to spend a weekend,"This is a nice book to spend a rainy day or weekend, or to have something to read while your kids are playing at the park. I thought this one was going to change my mind on Dan Brown's work but found it to be sort of repeating. It's like Brown found a recipe to write, then applied to every book he's written. I mean, this might be good for sequels, like Harry Potter or LOTR, but these are different stories. Anyway, nice reading when you have nothing else to do. Plot gets boring at some point and totally predictable."
5,Great twists!,"I never know what to expect, and that is why it any book by Dan Brown keeps me going. I had not red fiction for some time but am glad to have returned after having found something worth while!"
1,I might give up reading entirely!,"This book was so bad that I might give up reading for the rest of my life to avoid a repeat experience. I took it on a flight and had nothing else to read, so I kept going hoping it would get better. By the end, I wanted to open the emergency exit and leap out to end my misery. It is formulaic and implausible, with plot twists as a substitute for actual plot. Erase my memory, please, and give me back my 5 hours."
2,Deceptive Ending,"Dan Brown has hit upon a formula for his novels where (if you've read some of them) you will recognize the protagonist, the nomitive antagonist, a supporting character(s) who you are lead to believe is working for the antagonist and, finally (and near the end), the actual bad guy. The bad guy's identity is usually a surprise in that the material preceding the finale is even handed and unbiased.Brown has followed this formula for at least 4 of the books I have read, and frankly it is wearing thin.He has always managed to serve up politically neutral material before this one, however. But not here.He has taken pains to paint one political party as above board and sacrifing and the other to be featured by a self-centered, abusive personality. He has even taken the opportunity to paint the nation's military in an unfavorable light.Altogether a disappointing book!"
1,"Boring, formulaic","It took me a second to remember which dan brown book this was, not that it really matters as they are all incredibly similar but I couldn't even make it through a quarter of this book.Dan Brown's books are considered ""Smart Thillers"" which apparently means there is a plot twist, oohhhh"
2,"Good beginning, then downhill","An interesting, well developed, fast paced plot which unfortunately is undercut by predicable and uninteresting characters. But the real problem with this thriller is that the escapades of its characters are simply not real"
2,I'm confused ... or maybe I'm not,"WARNING: CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERSI finished another Dan Brown novel this weekend, but now I'm confused.Which one is it that has a wonderful amount of technical information but is so very plot heavy? It's the one where the main non-protagonist good guy turns about to be the main bad guy about 90% through the book and the obvious villain turns out to be good. You know, the one where the boy and girl who just met fall in love and sleep together at the end . . .Oh wait, that's all of them."
4,Intriguing science; implausible escapes,"My first foray with Mr. Brown was with the ""Da Vinci Code,"" which was a wonderful page-turner. Same with ""Deception Point,"" a fascinating page-turner as well. I loved the science and the fast-paced plot of this one as well as ""Angels and Demons,"" and ""Code."" What bothered me most about ""Deception"" and ""Angels"" were the many escapes from death in the absolute nick of time. They are all based on the characters' knowledge of certain scientific principles, which, although intriguing, were nevertheless far-fetched. Nonetheless, I recommend ""Deception Point"" for its entertainment value, as I do the others. You also will learn some interesting science and/or history."
3,Seems like it was written to be a movie,I loved the DaVinci Code and this book is pretty good if you can get past some of the things that just don't seem possible. At one point a character gets into NASA's headquarters without any credentials & I can't see that happening except in a movie. There were also other incidents that just didn't seem plausible.
3,another good read from dan brown,"fun book, just like his others. some parts tend to drag, but overall very entertaining. if i had to choose, this one is better than digital fortress."
4,Solid Read,Very good book. Full of action to keep you reading from chapter to chapter. Very Good character development. I am a very selective reader and I suggest this book to anyone wanting a Good solid page turner.
2,well...now for something completely different...,"Gee, I guess I'm the only one in the world who thought the writing in this book absolutely sucked. Two-dimensional stock characters that I couldn't even force myself to care about, an okay but somewhat bored plot, pedestrian writing, and IRRITATING product placements - I got the feeling, as I do in Grisham books, that this book is an exercise in cynical marketing, NOT in creative, incisive writing. Yuck: No more Dan Brown for me. (While reading this book, I actually started wondering if ""DANBROWN"" was an acronym for software that had been programmed to churn out this kind of junk...)"
1,Not Up to Snuff,"trite characters, all have some departed one with an issue. Characters have no depth, the book seemed to be written by some one other then Dad Brown. If I had not read several of his other books I would cross him off as another author just trying to make a dime and not doing a good job of it.Skip this book unless you have very low standards."
3,More of the same,"This was the third book by Dan Brown that I've read, and I've set it down in dissapointment and boredom. If you have not read Brown before, I would recommend the book as exciting and shocking. However, I've discovered that Brown uses the samebasic plot for all his stories. A widower falls in loe with a beautiful girl, they uncover a huge plot, save some lives, escape sure death, and live happily ever after. The details vary, but this book is just more of the sam efrom Brown."
2,worst dan brown book,this is the worst dan brown book. i got about 3/4 of the way through the book and just lost interest. it finally came to the point where i just wanted to finish the book because i've read so much of it. the ending wasn't anything spectacular.
3,Good if it's your first Dan Brown Book.,"This was an avg. book in the aggregate, however if you have read any of Dan Brown's others, this one will surely leave no surprises. The plot is extremely predictable. That being said, I would strongly suggest reading Angles & Demonds or the Da Vinci Code before reading this as to not spoil the plot of Mr. Brown's best two books. If you have read the two--A&D and DVC, than this should be a quick and fun read, albeit not extremly surprising."
4,Good Twists,"This story has a lot of great plot twists, which Dan Brown is great at. Unfortunately, I read this after Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress. I see the exact same situations in all the books. I don't want to spoil the book, if you haven't caught on to the cookie cutter story telling of this writer, it's a great book. Which is why I rated it a 4. But if you have read other Dan Brown books and began to see a pattern. Well there is one. I am aware this book was written before the other books, but I would write the same review for any of his books. Alone, they are easily 4's, Angels and Demons I'd give a 5. But after a while the pattern emerges. And then it becomes too predictable."
4,Great read,"This was a great read, a classic Dan Brown. His style keeps you hooked. If you liked any of his other hits you will enjoy this thriller. (Spoiler) Just remember, it is not who you most suspect; it is not who you least suspect; it is who you most medium suspect."
4,Deception at it's best.,"Ok, fact checkers, just to let you know this book is fiction and not all of the technology in this book exist. It doesn't matter, this book is a non sto page turner. If you have a long weekend and you plan to spend it reading this book you better get another one because you are gonna fly through this one. It was action from begining to end and loved every minut of it. It's probably not going to appeal to everyone as much as it did me, but if you like Dan Brown you will really enjoy this fantastic ride along. Buckle up because it's full of twist and turns and government conspricy. It's a real attention keeper right through to the end."
2,I lost interest,"This book was okay at first with a very nice pace and the way it dealt with politics and NASA was interesting. So the book had me hooked for a little while. However, after only getting maybe two hundred pages in you already know the twist and then you spend the rest of the time waiting for the characters to catch up with you. All the Dan Brown cliches are there from everyone having to be beautiful and attractive (with movie star good looks) and a very predictable master mind villain. I found it very annoying how the book insulted my intelligence and just skimmed through the rest of it. Not Dan Brown's best book. But then again, none of his books are truly that great."
4,Lots of twists and turns,I listened to this on audio tapes while I was on a long trip and enjoyed it very much. It's full of suspense and twists and turns.
2,Real life President cans NASA's manned moon mission,"President Obama has just announced that fundingfor the next ""man to the moon"" mission has been cancelleddue to budget constraints.Seems the President must have read ""Deception Point"" andembraced the ideas of the villian in the novel. i.e. thatthe space program is best handled by private enterprise.How ironic that it takes a real-life President torefute notions of good and evil as propounded by Dan Brown,and opt for political compromise.The read of DP is not as good as A&D; or DVC.Brown is becoming too formulaic, e.g. repeating thelast episode of each novel whereby the hero/heroine getto consummate their physical attraction for one anotherafter the whole ordeal is over."
3,Better than average,"No use repeating things already covered in a previous 300 reviews.I'll add one observation about a gimmick Dan Brown uses way too often....he ends a significant number of chapters with ""My God !!!"". In fact he uses that phrase too often throughout the story. A cheap way to keep the excitement up I guess the theory goes. But Mr. Brown uses this gimmick for even inappropiate situations. He'll end a chapter with a character seemingly in shock at seeing something undescribed, ""My God !!!"". Oh what can it be !?? Then in the next chapter we discover that the character had merely glimpsed a helicopter, or even a large tent in one scene.....hardly worthy of a ""My God !!!"". Just try going through a day in your own life exclaiming ""My God!!!"" at every event. A traffic light....""My God !!!"". A cup of coffee...""My God !!!"". You get the point. Tiresome isn't it ? Give it a rest Mr. Brown."
3,Disapointing,"This book was a big disapointment after having read Angels & Demons. I never cared about any of the characters, never bought the ""blossoming"" romance between Rachel and Tolland and Senator Sexton is one of the worst caricatures of the devious Washington politician. I'm as cynical as the next guy, but, Sexton's actions towards the end of the novel regarding his daughter are just too hard to believe.I will say that there are some real genuine surprises in the book and despite my complaints it did keep me turing the pages. 3 stars ain't all bad.If you are new to Dan Brown I'd read Angels & Demons first. For my part, I will have to consider whether or not I want to take a chance on Brown's other novels."
2,Corny dribble,"This was the first Dan Brown book I have read and I was not impressed at all, it has put me off reading any more of his books. The story was corny and predictable, it seemed to be written in the same manner that someone would make a Hollywood action film. Lots of spills and thrills, highly entertaining but in the end quite droll and unsatisfying."
3,150 pages too long,"The 1st half of the book even the first 2/3 are great, but by that time you know how the story is going to pan out and there's little reason to keep reading. It became difficult to finish the last 150 pages or so."
1,Deserves Zero Stars,"Someone lent me this book, and if not for that reason, I would have closed it after reading the first few pages. Apart from the ridiculous story line, this book is so poorly written that it ought to be an embarrassment to both its author and publisher, except that it make a few bucks from the author's celebrity. There are tidbits of new technology sprinkled in it, but to call this ""thrilling"" literature is just very wrong. It was boring, boring, boring...and predictable. And to think I had lent the other person Simon Winchester's ""The Professor and the Madman"" and Stieg Larsson's ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."""
2,Is is the same Dan Brown?,"I was looking forward to another fast-paced, can't-put-down thriller after reading ""Da Vinci Code,"" but this book started out slow and formulaic. Brown's writing style seemed much different too. It had some interesting twists, but the ending was predictable."
1,One star because I could not give less,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Dan Brown shows he has not knowledge of or bothered to check the accuracy of much of anything in his book. The concepts of NASA, satellite orbits, satellite software problems, launch vehicles, rocket fuel and engine design or common laws of physics dealing with gases under pressure. The questions that were just left hanging, like how do you bore a hole up 100 ft into the bottom of a glacier and hold a 8 ton rock into it until it freezes in place. And that is jujst one example. How is it there is alway a guy and a girl who just happen to be single, good looking, that can end up together at the end. I am just glad I did not buy this book."
4,Deception point,"I was skeptical at first to read this book but it turned out to be very good.The book is interesting, makes you want to read some more, one page after another.I would absolutely recommend to read it."
3,Deception Point,"A fast paced, exciting novel, A blend of science, science fiction and political corruption. A good read during the election year. The story itself is hard to believe, but it doesn't seem to matter, it is an exciting read from cover to cover. Not entirely predictable and with what seems to be the Dan Brown trademark interestingly amusing ending. ** September 2004"
3,Good Read for a Long Flight - But Don't Buy The Hardcover!,"Purchased the book while in London and read most of it on the flight back to the US.Essentially, the book was filler for my trip back to NYC.I've really enjoyed Brown's other works, but do think he hit his high note with the DaVinci Code.Deception Point has to be taken with a grain of salt and like any film or work of print fiction, you have to suspend logic or (certain aspects) of reality.Needless to say, it does work as a thriller and there are some fine twists, but the story was predictable and the characters less than three dimensional.So while the work was easily readable and somewhat enjoyable, it is equally easily forgettable."
1,Author lost in twists and turns!,"This is book is a great example of how sometimes good writers are lost in the twists and turns of their own work. The book starts with a great promise, but ends rather anticlimactically. The main character Rachel seems quite confused as she, in the first 95% of the novel, is risks her life to get evidence of the truth and spends last 5% of the novel trying to hide the same evidence. She starts with philosophy of 'having no assumptions only evidence' but at the end accepts the innocence of one party without any proof. Even though most of the book is interesting the end is disappointing."
3,Don't miss the ending!,"If you've already read The Davinci Code and Angels and Demons, and are looking for more Dan Brown suspense, you might be a little disappointed with Deception Point. It's slow in the beginning, but don't give it up. The last 100 pages is some of the most exciting I've ever read. Check it out!"
2,Not Impressed,"This is the first Dan Brown book I have read and I have to say that I am not impressed.The book started out good, but then turned out way overblown. It left me thinking the same thing I thought when I saw the movie Meet The Parents, how many bad things can happen to one person in such a short time?Overall I would say if you did not get to read this book, you really did not miss out on much."
1,Dan Brown- the Old Prize Fighter,"Dan Brown's ""Deception Point"" seems eerily similar to ""The Da Vinci Code"". The characters are the same, the plot is basically the same, and the twists are the same. There are only so many times you can feint with your right and follow with a left hook for a knockout before everyone in the world sees it coming 3 rounds earlier. Dan Brown needs new characters, new plot, and new ideas. Another good analogy for this book is Tom CLancy light: same great taste without the substance!"
4,good thriller but not great...,This is the first book of Dan Brown that I read and I am already attracted to his writing. So much information blended very well with imagination. Such is a great story. The plot was well laid and I was looking for loopholes while reading through. His stunts description are exhaustive however some I feel are relevant. I am already on to Angels & demons and cannot wait to buy Da Vinci Code...
4,Great book..I couldn't put it down!,After reading the subject of this book I was a little worried that I wouldn't enjoy it as much as Angels & Demons or DaVinci Code but I was very wrong. Although I found the revealing of the villian to be anti-climatic because I felt like I was being led there...I still really enjoyed the details that Dan Brown placed in this book much like his others. I had a very hard time putting it down and would reccomend it to anyone.
3,"Good, but disapointing","In no doubt this was an excellent book, but I read it at a time when I was probably too young to read something so adult and advanced. The plot was excellent and I loved the smarts, but this book did drag on a a few parts and I had to force myself to read so I could see what happened after the cliffhanger.After reading all of Brown's books, this is about in the middle of his best work. One thing I did notice, is that a lot of his plots involve the same deception, and that is simply why I didn't like this one - it was the last I read of his books with the same similar plot."
5,Seriously...,it is the most fast paced book of the four that Dan Brown wrote..I would recommend everyone to read it except if they are only into books like Da Vinci Code that include religious/historical facts..
1,Yet another balderdash!,"God... Why do authors like Dan Brown and Michael Crichton take their readers to be stupid? The plot of 'Deception Point' is outrageously unscientific - and, by the way, a real scientist would tell you that you cannot fake a meteorite the way Brown describes it. He has made the director of NASA and the President of United States seem utterly jobless (has he been hanging aroud with GW Bush lately?), and touched upon theories like panspermia with the eye of a charlatan.Okay, when have these page-turners had any real plots? There is always chasing, action, sex, incredible chain of events, and flaccid narration. I can excuse all of that. Now, what have I been left with? Ugh, nothing. Half-a-star - that sums it up.You can go and read this from any lending library. It gives the promised fun-ride. But there is nothing to cherish, to ponder and absolutely nothing to be content with."
2,Disappointing,"This book bored me. I have read The Da Vinci Code and was not too impressed with the book, this book was Brown's second chance to impress me, unfortunately he didn't. The book was too contrived, the action was dull, and the romantic subplot ridiculously cliched. Oh and to mention the plot, it might have been interesting if not for one thing, I have encountered a book with a similar plot line called Ice Station by Mathew Reilly and it is really a much better book. So folks, if you're looking for a good ""fly by the seat of your pants"" kind of action book, look in to Mathew Reilly, you'll be much happier."
3,"It's ok, but it's worn",The book is in pretty good condition except that the pages are a little yellowed and worn and there is a mark on the side of the pages.
5,Brilliant as expected,Thrilling and as soon as I thought I knew what was going to happen there was a great twist.Will recommend this book to everyone I know.
3,Decent,"I got this simply because of Angels and Demons and Davinci Code... While it is not as entertaining as those, this book is still a page-turner. Well written but a little campy at times. And to enjoy it, you should put aside the fact that this could never happen in a million years..."
3,Just ok,"Started well, but faded quickly. Gets more and more unbelievable towards the end. Quick read and overall pretty interesting despite its flaws. Just average."
3,Couldn't put it down,"I am a huge fan of Dan Brown. I love his writing style and his short chapters... it's easy to say ""I'll read just one more chapter then get back to work."" Before you know it you've finished the entire book. Dan Brown has a way of grabbing the readers attention in the first chapter. This book, while the story was good and the writing excellent, was not his best in my opinion. I felt it was just a little predictable. But overall an enjoyable read."
4,Great Book,After reading Da Vinci code I wanted to check out the other books written by Dan Brown and honestly think this is even better than the Da Vinic code.
4,Not bad not bad at all,"This book starts out pretty dry and does not really get going until around the middle of the book. like most of Dan Browns books the story is fairly choppy to keep the reader guessing but the more you find out about the plot, the more it pulls you in. Some of the scenes are a little over dramatic, but not too over the top."
3,Another page turner... but the ending is similar to others,"This is the third book I read from Brown. I totally recommend Angels and Demons, The Da Vinci Code is good, too. However, after two books, no matter how much research Dan Brown has done, the twists and turns seem very familiar. It's definitely another page turner, yet when you read the last couple of chapters, you could kinda guess who was the real villain. However, if you're addicted to suspense, like to read about scientific discoveries and NASA, this is still a good book."
4,Deception is the Name of the Game,"This is my fourth Dan Brown novel and while it may not be up to the DaVinci Code's standards, it is a pretty good effort of adventure writing. A president is in trouble in the polls; his opponant is a ruthless SOB who steps on people rather than around them; the opponant's daughter is called upon by the president to go to the Arctic to verify a scientific find of monumental proportions which can have a conclusive impact on the presidential race and this is just the beginning of a chilling story of intrigue, deception, miscalculation and ambition. The reader is drawn along in unraveling the mystery behind the find in the Arctic and then propelled suddenly into a race for revelaing the truth. Things are seldom what they seem and we can all be thankful that this is a true work of fiction. It will hold your interest and picque your curiosity throughout, which is a pretty good trick for any author."
2,Carbon Copy of Da Vinci Code,"I read the Da Vinci Code before this book and it was sad to see that these books are blue prints of one another. Choose one, the other will certainly be a let down."
2,well written but faaaarfetched,"I was amazed at how much this book did draw me in despite my irritations and frustrations with it. I never did see how a condenser of other peoples' reports suddenly winds up being on a covert op for the President, up to the Arctic. Then, thru a series of wild physical adventures (obviously written with the cinematic version in mind) solves the ""alien life"" issue and ""saves the day"". I did get thru the whole thing. Tho' it took several tries to finish it. I did find myself talking back to the author on more than one occasion, saying ""Oh, please, just give me a break here!"" All in all, I wish I hadn't wasted my money and my time on this one."
3,It just didn't have that Demons feel,"I just finished Deception Point, and albeit a well written novel that raced along at ""Dan Brown speed"", I couldn't help but feel disappointment in the story itself. I loved Angels and Demons, but this novel lacked the mystery element that A&D had. I also thought the characters a bit hooky...but hey it is a novel of fun, not literature. I will say that Mr. Brown does a great job, in bringing new tech ideas to the forefront. I know you will hate me for saying this, but I can't help it."
4,Another Long Day,"AS in the DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons the action takes place in one long day. The good news about this is there really is little time to develop characters. The books are a wild ride in every available method of transportation.It is natural to compare this effort to the two mentioned above. It is a weak third. The style is the same, a long day with the unknown person until the end driving the action. The problem with this book is the escapes were even more hard to believe, the scenarion was less believable, the escapes were outlandish and the ending was more contrived. Having said all of that I must admit it was fun to read."
3,"A pretty good book, but a little disappointing in the end.","Dan Brown's book ""Deception Point"" is a very good novel on all accounts. I highly suggest you read it if you are into the mainstream high-speed action novels Brown is known for. If you read ""Angels & Demons"" or ""The Da Vinci Code"" you will like this book but I doubt you'll like it better than either of those. The book had a few nice twists and turns and good action but I found the end very upsetting. This weak and cheap happy ending leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth and gives the book overal a feeling of ""ehh."" Still, uptil the last 15 pages it is very satisfying. Pick it up."
5,No deception of this man's talent!,"Dan Brown knows just how to keep you hanging on... to the point that I could not put this book down! Every spare moment I had, I was digging in and trying to figure it out. It keeps moving the whole time, full of action and moments when you are down right befuddled! A true sign of an excellent writer, he elicits many emotions, some simultaneously! What happens in just over 24 hours is amazing. Long before the hit TV show ""24"", this author had 24 hours of action and adventure all figured out."
3,"Good, but unrealistic","To start off, Dan Brown is an excellent writer. However, I do not think that his greatest strength is in pure science as much as the fine arts. His artistic comments in The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons were very insightful.In Deception Point he attempts to create a world where emminent astronomists can be fooled into thinking an ocean rock is a meteorite and highly trained assasins can not only be evaded, but incapacited, negotiated with, and even killed.Although the writing IS good, it reveals one of Brown's rare weaknesses. I still do recommend it, but it will cause you to pause in your reading to stare disbelievingly at the book many times closer to the end"
5,No Deception Here!,"Deception Point is a real thriller, armed with Brown's inimitable style. It starts off cryptically, and manages to keep you guessing as to who really is up to what and why, even though half of the how is handed to you as you read! It's the mark of a good book when you have enough answers to make a short list of suspects, but this novel goes a step further by making sure that your list is occupied by characters you can't seem to choose between! Pick this up and don't delay!"
3,Even Dan Brown fans can probably skip this one.,"Unfortunately, I read this book after The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons and Digital Fortress. The books were read in that order and provided diminishing entertainment returns.Brown's two best books are Da Vinci and Angels & Demons. Digital Fortress is a bit geeky, but still a pretty good read.Deception Point, in contrast to all of the above, is a bit dull and formula driven.The good news it that Brown's latest book is his best one yet."
2,Deception Point,"As The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, Deception Point is a fascinating story. Action packed and thrilling, I felt I could not put it down until I was done reading, but then came the disappointment. As his previous two books, boy and girl now have to save the U.S. presidencial office, all in one day, in one far-fetched adventure after another. Characters that survive getting lost in the North Pole and fall into Arctic waters, but suffer no frost bite and only mild shock, fly for hours in one day, swim with sharks and survive bullet wounds, etc., and still have the energy to have breakfast at the White House, well.... Unlike his other two books, this one does not leave you with a sense of having read an educated novel, instead, you feel you really enjoyed wasting your time."
4,Another Great book by Brown,"I picked up this book after finishing ""Angels and Daemons"" and was looking forward to another thriller that would keep me reading until the early hours of the morning. Well, that's what I got with ""Deception Point""!When I first started reading this book, I was a bit afraid that the plot was just to out there for my liking, well by the middle of the book a 180-degree plot twist made me more interested in this fun book.This was an easy read that was a great book for those times where you do not want to have to think that much about the plot. I think that this book would make an excellent movie and that the characters were well developed and the plot was fascinating.All in all I would highly recommend this book!"
3,Decent,"Deception Point is a typical Dan Brown novel, with decent characters and a decent, albeit far-fetched, plot. One of the more implausible elements of his plot is the presidential debate between the challenging party's presidential candidate and the incumbent party's presidential chief of staff. This novel also features Mr. Brown's bland writing style. This author does not know how to write clever similes, or any other figures of speech."
3,SETI:,"the Search for Extraterrestrial Invertebrates. This is the central plot line of Dan Brown's erzatz thriller, Deception Point. It is also an apt description of the characterization.The book was apparently motivated by the 1996 scientific scandal in which the Administration announced evidence of life in a Martian meteorite. No way Al Gore could be so dumb. It must have been a conspiracy.Deception Point disappoints on virtually every level. The triple-crossing plot is tangled, but not intricate. The prose and dialog are dull. Science-fiction elements turn up as convenient gimmicks. The government agencies and officials don't even pretend to obey the rules and constraints of their actual namesakes. However, there's no problem with plot resolution: the master of secrecy suffers the usual compulsion to explain all to his victims.As for originality and excitement, get ready for a thrilling conclusion copied directly from (I kid you not) The Little Mermaid."
3,Sub-par for Dan Brown but still a real page-turner,"One really bad character really hurt this book - the villainous senator's campaign manager. She's supposedly brilliant but she's a complete idiot - she knows NOTHING about politics, people, campaign financing, the DC environment, etc. The other characters are not well-developed (i.e., do they seem like they might be real people?), but the heroes have some plausibility, the senator is a simple cartoon character (but it doesn't matter because he's just a dramatic foil), and the characters alctually have a little texture.The story is entertaining and provokes thought occasionally. There's a certain Mission Impossible action feel - enivision 3 tethered good guys being pulled accross the ice by a spinaker in an 80 knot wind while the bad guys chase on motorized skis!I guess I was disappointed because I thought Code was better crafted. I wasn't sorry I spent my time reading the book but I wasn't glad I had read it, either."
1,Aptly titled...,"This book is aptly titled...it must be the point of deception in this writer's cv. I hate leaving a bad review...but I hated wading through the cliched writing, absurd plot, and tired tropes. Don't waste your time."
2,Are art symbols easier than science? Or more popular?,"This and Brown's other pre-DaVinci novel are similar to the books he's famous far, except art history and religious speculation have been substituted for science speculation (or combined as in Angels and Demons).Given that readers more knowledgeable than I have dismissed the science in this book, I have to wonder whether he switched tracks because art is easier than science.Or perhaps it's more popular, because I doubt many people at this stage are as emotional about NASA as this book assumes.This is a wild ride that's barely credible, but of course exciting.And if you've read other Brown books, you'll easily guess who the ultimate villain is -- it follows the same formula of his other books.It read easily and was worthwhile. I would have given it 3 stars except he made Special Forces soldiers out to be bad guys, and I can't accept that."
3,Conspiracy Theorest Gone Awry,"Dan Brown is known for being a conspiracy theorist in his writings and this one is no different. He has a great ability to tell an amazing story that has you unsure of what is fiction and what is reality. In Deception Point, I think he might have gone too far with the conspiracy theorist...he somehow has you guessing at which high ranking political figure is using covert ops to work with NASA to plant a meteorite with life under an iceberg that would then be detected by NASA satellites, and then to cover it all up at whatever costs by chasing down and trying to kill the main characters throughout the book...and all this in an attempt to win an election and save NASA's funding...like I said conspiracy theory gone awry.It is a fun story to read though, but out of Dan Brown's 5 current novels...this would rank 4th, only above Digital Fortress."
4,As always a great page turner.,The book is a typical Dan Brown page turner. Although perhaps not the best Dan Brown book I very much enjoyed it and recommend it.
2,seriously?,"I really appreciate that none of the cds had any skips in it, but the fact that the 14th disc, the climax of the book, was from a totally different story, made me feel a little jipped. It seemed like a publishers error but for anyone to sell this product after knowing that, seems a little dishonest. Frustrating to miss a good chunk of the story."
2,Lower your expectations,"for this piece by Dan Brown. As other reviewers have noted, it is no AngelsDemons or DaVinci.I bought this at the airport while waiting for my flight.. It was just enough to keep me engaged in some kind of mental activity, but I would say the plot is quite predictable and has nothing of the richness that you can find in the DV and AD. Had I sat down to read it like I did the DaVinci Code I wouldn't have even finished the book."
3,"Deception is the Point, Allright","If I were affiliated with Delta Force in any way, I'd sue Dan Brown, and I'd win. He depicts this elite special forces unit as psychopathic killers, and boldly claims they ""answer to no one."" Unfortunately, the document he cites as proof of their immunity from prosecution doesn't even mention Delta Force, or even special forces.Aside from this hole, there are plenty of others. The plot is imaginative, but Brown seems to have no sense of responsibility to the truth as a writer.It's a good story. It would be better if Brown cared about things like facts and credibility."
5,Excellent!!!,The book was full of surprises! There was no way to guess what was going to happen next. The story was GREAT! I couldn't have loved it more!
3,"Starts good, downhill from there","Having read DV code and Digital Fortress I settled back on a transatlantic flight to enjoy another Dan Brown time-filling read.This book starts well and got me pretty engrossed for about the first 2/3 of the book. Then the bubble bursts and you find yourself wallowing through the final hundred pages hoping something surprising will happen..Not his best, but if you're on a plane with nothing else to there are probably worse books you could have in your bag"
2,Not his best work,"I read The Da Vinci Code, then Angels and Demons. I couldn't put these down, so I couldn't wait to start Deception Point. While I would have to say the book was okay, it wasn't up to par with The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. It was just too far fetched for me. Just when you think there is no way they can get out of their current issue, the unthinkable happens. A submarine coming to the rescue? Just a little too out there for me. It would be a good place to start for someone wanting to read Dan Brown. I, however, was disappointed after his wonderful books The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons."
3,too black and white...,"Though I found the writing of this novel to be very easy to read, and the pace enjoyable, there was depth lacking in the story that made it short a few stars.The characters were not well developed enough to understand their motives. Throw away lines and nasty, two-dimensional politics form a backbone of the story that left me, as a reader, wishing for something more substantial.The scientific plot was absolutely cool, and the resolution thereof had enough twists and turns to make me happy, though.A book that's a quick read, but won't leave you wondering about it, as angels and demons did (for me, anyhow).(*)>"
4,Great Adventure At Fast Speed,"Great read after the previous book ""Angels and Demons"". For this ""Deception Point"" I was hooked at the beginning but slowly waned off towards the end. There are some good descriptions of the American's political systems/scenes and the author Dan Brown kept me guessing until towards the 4/5 of the book. Then after that, the story went down hill (or shall I say, down the drain into the deep dark ocean); the scenario reminded me of some B-grade Hollywood action thriller movie. Overall, it is a good book to read."
2,disappointing,"After reading The da Vinci Code, I found this book way too predictable. Somehow from the very beginning you know who the good guys and bad guys are and how it is going to end. Some how you know NASA is not going to be at fault and ""those pictures"" are not going to go to waste. The set up for that little expose was way too obvious. The only surprise was the surprisingly bad ending."
2,Too Wordy,"This author never met a machine he didn't like. The seemingly endless descriptions of every gadget in this book, and there are many, really get in the way of the action."
3,A bit thin...,"After having read Angels and Demons, and DaVinci Code, I expected this earlier book to be good, but not as polished as Brown's earlier stuff. I was right, actually disappointed. Brown's writing style is very readable, but he's never going to win an award for great writing. The plot to this book is predictable. It's a page turner, but not because you want to find out what's going to happen next (that's pretty easy) but because you hope something interesting happens next. Fortunately its one of those books you can fly through. I guess it entertaining but by page 500 I was reading it just to finish it. The characters are so thin in this book you start making up personalities for them based solely on their names. I mean Corky is going to be a quirky, science loving nerd who supplies the odd comical bit. There are dozens of better thrillers out there. The only reason this one gets 3 stars is because I finished it."
3,Bad,"one can tolerate a book that starts off like a bestseller and ends like a... well, something that doesn't look like a bestseller. but this book belongs to the worst category: intermittently readable. starts off well, then the reader is lost in the Labyrinth of the Technical Jargon, then picks up again, then slacks, again, and then, finally, mercifully, ends. skip it!"
4,"You'll enjoy it, but you'll hate yourself in the morning","This book proves the value of story over credibility. Take a labored premise, adolescent dialog, and ""Wile E. Coyote"" action sequences tied together with a series of deus ex machinae that would embarrass a high school freshman writing his first short story, and you have an inkling of what ""Deception Point"" is like. Literature it ain't, but it is one heck of a read. This potboiler of Washington politics, popular science, fears overcome, and love reawakened will have you leaping from page to page."
4,Fun and quick escape reading.,"Although many aspects both political and scientific are a bit hard to swallow, this doesn't prevent the book from being an enjoyable fast paced read. I'd certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of escape reading. Who cares if parts of it aren't very realistic? It's still fun!"
3,Just love being deceived?,"If you loved The Da Vinci Code, chances are you will like this. Likewise, if you thought the DVC had shallow characters, foreseeable plot development, flaky facts, etc. you will find the same in DP. Being a conspiracy enthusiast, I thought even the conspiracies were shallow, if not highly amusing, especially the ""wasteful"" NASA and SETI vs ""efficient"" private industry. Somebody get Mr. Brown a program so he'll know which sides all the players are really on! Who do you think benefits from all the ""waste"" - most of which is highly classified? We're more than ready for an ET that looks like a giant louse, and now, thanks to Spielberg, maybe even one that looks like ET. Now there's a conspiracy!"
3,OK book but bad NASA research,"As a simple thriller, this book is entertaining. The plot moves along briskly and the author does a nice job of breaking the story up into nice, digestible chunks. However, as someone who knows a bit about NASA, it was clear to me that Dan Brown kind of phoned in that aspect of his research. Oh, sure, he threw in some convincing acronyms and mentioned a few real programs, but many of the ""facts"" about NASA's organization and programs which were used as critical plot points were just plain wrong. So, if you read this book, pretend that NASA stands for ""Not the American Space Agency"" and enjoy."
4,Dan Brown is my new favorite,"I gave Deception Point 4 stars because this is my least favorite Dan Brown book of the 4 that I've read. But this one was almost as engrossing as the others, and had a more scientific bent that some people might really enjoy."
1,Leave well alone,"I, like a large number of people have been introduced to Dan Brown via his marvelous The Da Vinci Code. On finishing this, I read and enjoyed almost as much Angels and Deamons. On the back of these two books, I decided to continue on, as I'm sure many other people have done with other novels he had written.What did concern me was the fact that his other books went by pretty much un-noticed until the success of The Da vinci Code. Why? Because they are increadibly poor. I have just finished reading Deception Point, and I have to admit, I breathed a huge sigh of relief that I could finally move on to something else after enduring nearly 600 pages. The storyline was thin, and the further into the book you go, the more ridiculous it becomes. Far to often, it becomes too difficult to picture in your own mind what is happening as the description of action scenes is just so far fetched.My advice is enjoy and leave Dan Brown well alone after reading The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons."
3,Boring!,"This Dan Brown book was not very good. I just finished reading Angels and Demons (excellent) and was expecting another page-turner. This book was boring and I only finished it because I thought it would get better with the turn of a page. Alas, didn't happen!"
4,"""Da Vinci""... who?","No doubt (for me :) ) this is the best book by Brown. As the writer has matured, his books have evolved from pretty much a movie storyboard descriptor to a more complex and well managed fiction, more rooted in history and technology. This book presents realistic characters, and notably hinges on a column of the American society, namely the need to believe in the institutions. To read."
2,i keep hopeing it would get better,"After reading the back of this book, (and having just finished a book i loved by Dan Brown), I started this book ready to be taken on grate thrill ride. all throw this book however I keep thinking and hoping it would get better. it never did, there is one good part throw it ends."
3,Not Dan Brown's best work,"I saw a lot of posts that were either extremely pro or against this book. However, it's not as bad as some make it out to be. While it does have the classic Dan Brown thrill and twist, I think it falls apart in the end. Without giving much away, I think that the book's ending is either too predicable (though only if you're and avid Dan Brown fan already) or too twisted to be fully appreciated. For me it was the former, so I was just slightly disappointed. In either case, if you're looking for something to pass the time while on a family vacation or between long flights, this book isn't too bad; though, you could probably do better."
1,Poorly written with a nonbelievable story line,I read Deception Point expecting/hoping it would live up to the da Vinci Code. It did not. The characters were unbelievable and the plot was poorly done. The more I read the more I disliked the book.Save your money and your time. Read something else.
4,Surprisingly Good,"After I read Angels & Demons--which I found to be excellent--I decided to read his other books, and I was pleasantly surprised that this book was quite good."
2,Could have been better,"The plot and characters were great and it would make a terrific movie, but it read almost more like a screenplay than a novel. Lacking in character development. If you are just interested in an exciting story, it's fine. But if you really like to get into the lives of the people in the novels you read, I don't recommend it."
5,Outstanding!,"This is a great story and was fantastically read by Richard Poe. For all of you who don't have time to read a good book, listen to this one. It's full of excitement and deception. I enjoyed it."
2,Severely disappointing,"For those who have already read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, this book is a severe let down. This is one of the first books that Dan Brown wrote and it shows. The story isn't developed nearly as well as the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. Angels and Demons is where the reader can really tell that Dan Brown is becoming a good writer. Dan Brown wrote the Da Vinci Code after he finished Angels and Demons. In the Da Vinci Code I think he perfected his craft. You can see errors that he committed in Angels and Demons that he fixed in the Da Vinci Code.Deception Point is about cryptography, but if you like a story about a subject such as that I would much rather recommend Body of Secrets by James Bamford. It's a much more interesting read."
3,good page turner,"this is the first book that I've been able to read in the last 4.5 months after going through a very rough loss. The fact that I was able to read it at all, let alone in 2 weeks is worthy of a couple of stars in my book. The ending is ridiculous though. I was annoyed at far too many ""just in the nick of time"" saves throughout the made-for-Hollywood ending. As far as the reviews calling the plot ""implausible"" etc, it IS an action thriller piece of FICTION afterall. Cut the guy some slack."
2,Long trip to nowhere.,"Might appeal to some for lots of sciencey stuff; however, he spins his wheels too much. Scores of short redundant chapters. And just not a terribly stimulating premise."
4,Another Dan Brown,"If you have read the three other Dan Browns then you'll recognize the pattern: a murder in the prolog, a professorial-type guy, a bright attractive women... Rings a bell? The book is mostly fast paced (but in a couple of places), easy to read and the plot is interesting."
3,"Not his best, but not bad","'Deception Point', though not lacking for action and plot twists, lacks the depth and intrigue of 'DaVinci Code' or 'Angels and Demons'. This book reminds me of James Rollins' work, or a lighter Douglas Preston/Lincoln Child. Worth picking up in paperback if you like action-adventure-mystery."
1,Worst novel ever written!,"This was the first Dan Brown book i ever picked up, after reading it i felt a great wave of depression. I wanted my money and time back after buying it and reading it. The plot is loose rip off Ice Station from Matthew Reilly a fantastic author. The twist at the end was ridiculous to say the least and made no sense.The book read like most of Dan 'thief' Brown works, microcosms of action with science fiction and historical fiction based in a present day scenario. These little sequences designed to keep the author reading without actually achieving anything whilst entertaining the reader with falsehoods of history and pseudoscience.If you enjoy reading good books stay away from Dan Brown, especially Deception Point - Worst book ever!"
1,"NO STARS, REALLY","Not recommended. Sleazy. Only picked it because my brain was mush right then. There were at least 35 cliffhangers ... and it just got to the point where I would laugh at a new cliffhanger ... and not even care what happened to the person. That said, there was some cool/creepy technology. Cool from a purely intellectual point of view. Creepy from a human vs. Big Brother point of view. For example, mini-bots. Tiny tiny robots in the shape of bugs - literally a fly on the wall that listens to people's conversations. A person can ""drive it"" all over -- into and out of rooms, into and out of buildings ... and spy on people. The book left a terrible margarine taste in my mouth."
2,Below average,"I have read three Dan Brown books: Da Vinci code, Angels and Demons and this..although the other two books where average at best, this is just pathetic..the plot is incredibly thin and you can spot the twists from chapters away..something which is rather annoying since you're screaming at the characters who are really for some reason quite dim and require 100 pages to figure out simple facts.. also this book reads like a second or even third rate Hollywood action movie..full of false american notions regarding God, patriotism and many overemphasized dramatic moments..it seems once you make a name for yourself any piece of trash you publish is a classic..recycle this.."
2,Ugh,"After reading Da Vinci Code, Digitial Fortress and Angels & Demons, this was a total let down. I read it, but could have spent my time doing something more interesting. I was too surreal. The other books were plausible but this one...sucked."
1,Third Strike,"After reading Deception Point, Digital Fortress and The DaVinci Code, I can tell Dan Brown is all style but no substance. All three books have great style and pace, but all the research is really messed up, so there's no real substance. I'm not reading anything else from this author."
4,Excellent character development,"Wow, I read this book on reccomendation of a friend and I am happy that I did. Not only does this fictional story come across very realistically, it also has some great twists and surprises toward the end. Although slow moving at times, it is a quick read and will get you hooked in no time. The characters are very well developed and it is interesting how some people change ( Gabrielle Ashe, for example ) and some never change ( Sexton ). Pick this book up right now!"
4,It gets better and better,"Thanks to Dan Brown, I am now a fan of thrillers! I have read three out of four of his works, and I'm hooked. Deception POint is one read that's definitely unputdown-able. What can I say? The book kept me guessing about what happens next, and more often than not, I couldnt guess how the events will progress from page to page. Although his writing can be formulaic, I still enjoyed the book and how it kept me glued to it."
3,Ho - Hum After DaVinci Code,"After thoroughly enjoying DaVinci Code, I was anxious to read more of this author's work. There are interesting twists and turns, with conspiracy after conspiracy. None the less, this book was disappointing. Tedious repetition of the boy and girl adventure theme. Unrealistic predictmant after unrealistic predicament,love triumphing over intelligence and logic. It did not hold my atention and beg me to keep reading. I was relieved when it was finally over."
3,"Possibly the definitive ""airport book""","If you pick up ""Deception Point"" expecting to find another installment of ""The Da Vinci Code"", you're likely to be disappointed. However, if you just want a good non-stop read, with action, intrigue, ""science stuff"", and derring-do, you'll find all in abundance. Think Clive Cussler rather than Tom Clancy--if you stop to think too much about some of the situations and some of the ""science"", you'll miss out on a fair amount of the fun. Just go along for the ride and enjoy it.By strange coincidence, this book is just the right length to get you through the wait in an airport, a domestic flight, and leave just enough for a relaxing afternoon read as you catch up with your jet lag. A useful length, and just the tale to lose oneself in while ""in transit""."
5,Possibly better than DaVinci Code!,"Dan brown is an excellent author. DaVinci Code is one of my all-time favorite books. Having said this, Deception Point is a very very close second. Dan Brown's research is unmatched and as a result, his novels are almost as educational as they are fun to read! And, just when you think you have this book figured out-surprise! Buy this book along with one other book because you will probably finish Deception Point in a few days."
3,Not my cup of tea,"This guy's book was supposed to be so hot and amazing, but it just didn't do it for me,. I loved the Davinci Code so much more."
3,Writing was not as experienced as his later books,"I devoured Angels and Demons and The da vinci code. Reguardless of all the comments on the content of the books, he wrote flawless books. The were smooth, smart and fun.Well----- this one was not as such.It was still a fun page turner, but you can tell that how his writing has drastically improved in his later novels. It is still a good book. I tend to judge the book, not compare the book to other authors, or nit pick it to ""truths"". So I suggest reading it if you are a geek for mysteries and adventure, but maybe not if you have read his more famous two. You may be a little disappointed."
3,Typical Dan Brown: Nothing Special,"This really is just an average book, just like the other Dan Brown novels. Dan Brown seems to be very good at building up a story but very bad at creating knockout endings. Both Da Vinci Code and Deception Point suffer from dissapointing endings, which leave the reader with a sour taste after such a promising start.This is mildly entertaining and at times gripping, easy reading but not really thought provoking.Buy this if you have a long haul flight, or are embarking on a long journey."
1,WORST narration ever!!!!,"This review is only for the narration (by Richard Poe). The book is great by the way. But I feel so ripped off by the annoying narrator I just had to get it out of my chest. Do a quick test and close your eyes. Now start making noises with your teeth, throat, lips, tongue, etc. Like swallowing saliva, sucking your teeth, licking your lips, and stuff like that. Now imagine listening to that through out the whole narration. Every 3 or 4 words Mr. Poe adds his ""special touch"". It is so incredibly distracting you can't even get into the story. It almost sounds like a home made audiobook recorded in the bathroom."
5,Great Author,Dan Brown has really proven to me how wonderful a writer he is. All his books have kept me wanting more. Would recommend to anyone.
2,One-Trick Pony,"Dan Brown, unfortunately, seems to be a one-trick pony. This book, which predates ""The DaVinci Code"" by about a year, follows pretty much the same ark. Two ""heroes"" (actually 3, but one is pretty much a throwaway) discover a secret, and are pursued by killers (Delta Force, instead of the Albino Priest), who are guided by the secret manipulator (The Controller, vs. The Teacher) who is a surprise when we find out who it is. Both stories take place in one continous swath over a day or two.Deception point also suffers from a generally preposterous plot. Brown invents far too many technologies, and doesn't do enough research on known technologies (do I really want to believe that a Los Angeles class submarine has enough space for an anechoic chamber in the middle?)Sorry, but I don't think I'll be picking up more works by Mr. Brown."
5,A Fun-To-Read Escapist Thriller!,"Dan Brown has done it again! Deception Point is the type of book his first two were- hard to put down! He grabs your attention right away and keeps you engrossed until the last page. My only complaint is that the covers on his books are too close together!Dan knows how to keep a reader enthralled- I don't find many authors who have that talent, so I'm delighted when he comes out with a new book. I've really enjoyed reading his well-researched novels and look forward to many, many more. Thanks, Dan!"
2,science or comedy?,"As an engineer currently working for NASA, and as a former Lockheed Martin engineer, I found parts of the book sadly laughable. Dan Brown should stick to writing about historical things instead of trying to be the next Tom Clancy. Even Clancy occassionally gets it right. The editors should be fired for gross stupidity as well."
2,Disappoints on many levels,"The writing style is predictable and full of uninteresting flat characters. That itself wouldn't necessarily kill the book as it is billed as a ""smart thriller"", not the next Anna Karenina. But the book fails to live up that expectation. It is full of plot holes, factual errors, and highly unlikely chains of events. Virtually nothing in the book seems even remotely believable. Dan Brown clearly forgot to do his homework on this one."
2,To predictable,"I read Digital Fortess, and then Deception Point. After reading Digital Fortess, deception was absolutely no fun. The plot is easily predicted because whenever the author doesn't tell you something, he is trying to trick you. I knew how the book was going to end even before I was half way done with it."
4,Nothing short of GREAT!!!,This is my second favorite Motorhead CD. The very first song punches you right in the face and kicks your @$$. Sucker grabs you and just does not let you go. It is a relentless CD that leaves you feeling violated and loved at the same time. The End.
3,Good as a Setting Lotion,"I don't know if this product will help with hair growth, but it is a great hair sculptor and sharper as well as holding your hair in place. Use this this product instead of hair gel because it also makes the hair feel thicker without being sticky or overly heavy. A little goes a long way and it lasts all day."
3,"Marry Rich, Be a Bitch","A bit old fashioned, not really a book that's come into the millenium. I think attitudes of men, especially, have changed a bit since then. She makes it sound like women must become absolute bitches to get the riches... Some of it is sound advice but im sure there's a better book out there....somewhere."
3,Insights on how to manipulate a man.,There is some useful information in this book on how to meet and associate with the rich. It is a good pep talk on how to ask for and expect great things in your life. I was very put off by the shallowness and manipulative nature of the author at times. Expect the best for yourself but use caution here. Good Luck
1,A book all about living a lie and an empty life come true,"This woman uses every deception, lie, false advertising and expansion of the truth to get near those with money. But, then what? Money is not the meaning of existence! Sure, maybe HER husband doesn't mind the deception, but what about the one that YOU might meet? I don't think that I would stoop to some of her tactics to get money. Why doesn't she try to make her OWN WAY in life? She may as well be a prostitute."
1,Lessons in Helplessness,"Or Lessons in Obsession, Lessons in Stalking, Lessons in Sexism, Lessons on How Not To Conduct a Relationship, Lessons in Body Hatred, Lessons on How To Develop An Eating Disorder.......need I continue?"
1,Sick,"I didn't read this book. But I find the title sick. If you find yourself wondering about such things, think about what makes you happy. Wealth, unless you're more animal than most humans, does not bring happiness. Re-eveluate your values. Thank you."
2,Poomse and nothing else,"The book covers the moves of every poomse, but lacks everything in covering the basic techniques.The basic kicks, stands and punches gets one (1) picture + a very short description each, so the movement is up to the reader to find out. I'm afraid a lot of beginners will get really bad techniques, if this book is the only source.The poomse's are covered in detail, and that's fine. Too bad the kicks, punches and stands are sometimes badly performed: Ms.Ricke seems to have only one front kick: The head section, even if it's describe as a kick to the middle section.The poomse's are great, the rest is fluff, and I 'm really annoyed that the original names for the moves are in english. It's a korean sport, and the three clubs I've attended has all used the real names, like Apchagi, Yopchagi etc....so it's a poomse-guide, and is nothing near a ""Training manual""."
3,My 2 cents,"This book whitewashes the history taekwondo from 1945-71. ITF anyone? Still, for someone learning the WTA system, it is worthwhile for its poomses, if nothing else. You still have to learn them from a master, but it's a good resource when you're practicing a new form at home and can't remember the next move."
3,Great for Poomse....and that's about it...,"To call this book ""the official training manual"" is an injustice. Better to call it a poomse(forms) manual. It is excellent in this facet, in both pictures and step-by-step instruction.The instructors are called ""the two top authorities in the world"" on the back of the book. For a publication that is endorsed by the WTF, it's almost laughable to see that claim.While Ms. Ricke has been raised to the rank of 4th Degree, I wonder how much time she has spent working on proper technique. Looking at the way she punches in the pictures, she could expect to not do too much damage were she to hit someone. Two knuckles, Ms. Ricke.Don't get me wrong, the authors have done a great job putting together a book that clearly outlines poomse and tournament rules. Everything else is fluff."
3,Thin on form descriptions,"This book is a typical tae kwon do book of forms. They demonstrate the end of the move with no thought for the stance or chamber. Its basically pictures of two practitioners (I know who they are and it doesn't make the book any better and they aren't very impressive here). They do not explain the move or why you are making a particular move, they just show you a picture. The only reason I bought this book was for the Palgwe forms, which are hard to find, and its borderline useless for those. For Taegeuk forms I recommend ""Tae Kwon Do, The State of the Art,"" and for Black Belt forms, "" Black Belt Tae Kwon Do: The Ultimate Reference Guide to the World's Most Popular Black Belt Martialart."" Sure you have to buy two books, but its better than buying this doorstop. It gets three stars for having the Palgwe forms, but if your looking for Palgwe, keep looking, there has got to be a better book out there."
2,Hate it.,This book messes up on Poomse's and other kinds of TKD moves. It's poomse's are unworthy. The people in this book are unworthy. DON'T buy this.
1,Fake leather,"Unlike the description from the seller, these are made with fake leather. Do not buy them. Cracks start to show up only a few days after wearing."
3,The Earthborn review,"Earthborn is the story the desendents of those left behind when Colony, the giant mother ship went searching for a new place for mankind 300 years ago. It is a companion book to Skyborn....the story of those raised on the ship before it crashed back to Earth. The charactors and stories intertwine. I read Skyborn first. There are some nice elements of leadership, primate anthropology and civilization gone bad. The Australian setting was interesting. They are simple good reading...bedtime stuff."
5,Comfortable and easy to hold,"I take this larger water bottle with me on my hour+ runs and love it. It is very comfortable and easy to hold. I only wish the pocket was a little bigger so it would fit my phone. I can fit 2 gels, my car key and some cash. Overall it's a great product."
3,"Carrier works great, bottle has terrible insulation","I run ~25-30 miles per week in Oklahoma, generally during the hottest part of the day. Shade is scarce, and water along my routes are limited, so i really wanted something to take with me. I had taken a water bottle before, but my hand would get tired of holding it, and i would move it from hand to hand. it seemed like i spent more focus on the water bottle versus the run. This strap that goes around this bottle is great, because it stays on my hand, and i don't think about it. HOWEVER, the bottle that comes with it has terrible insulation. So when i start my runs, because there is ice in the bottle, it FREEZES my hand, and i end up switching it from hand to hand because it is so uncomfortable. Then by the end of my longer runs, the water is pretty much hot...and therefore not that helpful to either drink or pour on myself...i think i might try to get a different bottle, and hope the strap mechanism will fit on that."
4,A good bottle to run with,"I've been using this bottle on every run I go on for the last 5 months. Anywhere from 5-15 mile runs. It is comfortable to carry, doesn't leak, and is easy to open and close. I am able to stuff 3 gels in the pocket with some cash. Alternately, I carry cash and my car key in the pocket. Sometimes it gets a little smelly, but you can easily remove the bottle holder and throw it in the washing machine. Only thing I can see that would make it better is that if it were insulated in some way. Since the bottle is in contact with your hand, cold water only stays cold about 20 minutes."
4,"Great overall, but sometimes leaks","Great product overall, although it does leak if the top isn't completely closed. And even when you think it's completely closed, it probably isn't. Annoying, but not a deal breaker.I do wish the pocket was a little bigger. Can't really fit more than one gel and a key in there, although my old crappy flip phone does just barely fit, which is a bonus. Most people probably won't be so lucky.It fits well on my hand and I tend to forget it's there after awhile. No need to grip the bottle when running - the strap will keep it in place. When it's half full, the water sloshing around can be distracting at times, but it still beats a hydration belt, in my opinion."
4,Not bad,"Not bad....running with ANYTHING in your hand is annoying but I have to carry fluid with me on my long runs since there are no public water fountains anywhere. My drink is very ice cold when I leave my house but about 30 minutes into a run it gets very warm from my hot sweaty hand. The pocket is small - my larger than most cell phone doesn't fit - I can only fit a tiny pack of fruit gummies in it - a SMALL phone, dollar bill, gu pack or a key may fit but not all the items at once. Also, wish it were BPA free?? Overall, it's good. I also like the soft bite nozzle."
4,Pretty Good Running Companion,"I decided to buy the Nathan hand held after all the personal reviews i heard from my triathlete friends about any of the belt systems. Basically the belt systems bounce around and are distracting.My Nathan performed well on my run. I found it really comfortable in my hand, no leaking (once spout is closed) and pretty easy to switch back and forth. I thought it would feel awkward, but it quickly disappeared in my hand.I would have given it 5 stars, but at the end of the day you are carrying around an extra pound or two that does make one of your arms a little weary and require switching. This downside could be applied to any of the carrying bottles and it's more than compensated by feeling stronger at the end of my runs (about 60 minutes) than i use to."
2,"Good container, but a pain to carry","I purchased this thinking it would be a handy way to hold my water. However, with cold morning training runs, I found it annoying to carry. Not just ""annoying"" but rather that the bottle was cold, the carrier isn't well insulated, so my hands were cold within minutes. I will keep with my water belt and stay away from this."
4,Works great but consider this.....,This is a great product but consider the hydration belt system. I've noticed on long runs my hand gets hot/sweaty holding the strap and I just like having my hands free when I run( reason for 4 stars). Otherwise great product but for me preference to the hydration belt system.The pocket is small but can hold an ID card along with a goo/gel pack for long runs.
4,Love this bottle!,"I was a little skeptical about running with something in my hand, but I absolutely LOVE this bottle for my long runs! I barely notice I'm carrying it, as weird as it sounds. The only thing is, make sure the lid is on tight or a little bit of water leaks and makes your hand wet. If you put the lid on all the way there's no problem though!!"
2,Leaky mouth piece,"I love the holster, and the bottle was a nice size but it doesn't stay closed. It leaks water when tilted or turned. I use the holster with a different bottle and I like it alot."
2,Gets heavy and sweaty,"When I first purchase this, I loved it! I used it during my first half marathon and realized quickly that I did not love it. Your hand gets sweaty and it is annoying holding onto something for the entire race. Most races will have enough water stops along the way anyway but if you want to have your special blend of some energy drink, I suggest a fuel belt. The belts take a bit to get used to but you get to keep your hands free and you don't get sweaty palms. I kept switching hands during the race. The pocket on the front holds a decent amount of items, it has a loop to hold a key, which I used. I could also put shot bloks in there along with my id, credit card, and a $5. The bottle, like most bottles, will end up getting moldy if you don't clean and dry properly."
3,Comfortable but needs a bigger pocket,"I use an insulated Polar bottle with the handheld. It takes some doing but I use the strap on the handheld to loop through the Polar bottle's plastic loop to secure it. The insulated bottle eliminates the problem of holding onto something that is too cold.This is comfortable to carry, even when full, for hours on end. At some point it is easy to forget that you are even holding anything.My one gripe is with the tiny pocket in the front. My slim cellphone barely squeezes in and I would not be able to carry anything larger. It would be nice to have a stretchy pocket so larger things can be secured."
4,Great carrier...horrible bottle,"The carrier itself is great - Comfortable grip/tightening device. The pad manages sweat well and the reflective strap is a nice feature (although it is a bit too long). The pocket is perfect for keys, a few dollars, lip balm, etc. Ideally I'd like the pocket to hold an iphone because I use it as my GPS but I knew that coming in and it would probably be too big anyway. The elastic straps keep the water bottle in place.The water bottle itself, however, is total garbage. The lid cross-threads very easily and the bite valve/nipple leaks like crazy. I lost nearly 1/3 of the water on a 3 mile run!!! Come on, Nathan, you're better than that. Luckily it's a standard size bottle so it's an easy fix. I'd rather spend a few bucks less and use my own bottle if it is going to be so bad though."
3,Not sure on the elastic life,I bought this for my short runs of 4-6 miles. I am 2 weeks in to using it and a little concerned that there is too much pull on the elastic for a snug fit on my hand. The gray elastic looks stressed at the top seam and is already showing pucker. I don't want to have to feel like I am gripping hard for it to stay in my hand. The strap that is to tighten the handheld around my hand does not stay tight : < ( On the plus - the pocket is a nice fit for a gel & a key. There is also an ID slip in there for an emergency contact # which is nice just in case...
3,Took some getting used to,"This is my first experience with having to carry liquid with me on runs and it's taken me a while to get used to holding it. It doesn't fit very well on my hands if I don't have gloves on, but that might be because my hands are small. The pouch is small, but can hold keys, a cell phone (it's tight with mine, but it does fit) or gels. It's hard to tell if the mouth piece is closed all the way so it leaks sometimes."
4,A must on a warm day,"This gets the job done, but my only issue is personal and that's that I loathe carrying around 22 ounces of water. It's heavy on a long run. Shoot, it's heavy on a short run! I usually only fill it half way and try and find a water fountain (if I pass a park) and refill it if I need to. I'd stick with a smaller bottle if I was going to buy again. Otherwise, having the little pouch is nice for gels, band-aids or keys if you need to stick them somewhere."
5,I really have enjoyed these bottle carriers,These have been my go to get outside water bottle carriers. Years later and still no issues. Worth every penny.
3,Slight Leak,"Pretty decent bottle and the pouch can almost fit a smart phone. The real draw back is the leaky valve. I've got another Nathan and have the same issue there. It's just slightly obnoxious, but it's better than running with a cup I suppose."
5,Best Yoga Book I've Ever Read....,"....and I've read alot of them.Art and Science of Raja Yoga has everything from easy beginner routines, to more advanced postures. And this book doesn't make you feel like some couch potato just because you can't do advanced pretzel poses.I also enjoyed the pranayama breathing exercises and meditation practices. I had never 'got' meditation until I began practicing some of the simple meditation techniques in this book.You can also contact the publishers of the book for followup support with your practices- everything from retreats, to other books, and more. I've never, ever heard of anything like this. Check it out!"
2,Not Good Enough,"I just got a Cool Sweep and am disappointed. I wish I had read the reviews first.I would like it except for the motor noise. It is whiney and I hear it quite well from even across the room on low speed.It seems like a low quality motor.Also, the body and hinges are a kind of plastic that feels like it could break easily.The two controls feel loose and are thin plastic."
2,Lots of Plastic,"I was intrigued by the design of this-the oscillating louvers are inside the fan. For the price, it seemed like it was kinda neat. However-the first one arrived damaged in shipping. Before even opening the box, there was a ""big rattle"" sound. Not good.Sent it back, asked for an exchange, and the second one arrived. It wasn't right, either. It's just a very cheesy flimsy hard plastic fan that is really fragile. I decided it probably wouldn't last long and returned it for a refund.I happen to know this company has made this type of fan for many years-it's just that it appears in an effort to save money they have significantly reduced the quality of the build materials."
1,A Sonic Mess...,"What an amazing album. Unfortunately, the sound on this release is horribly mastered. Too much digital hiss removal and heavy handed EQ spoils some brilliant music. I highly suggest the recently re-released Idle Race EMI CD set. it has problems of its own but is enjoyable nonetheless."
3,Idle Race - 'Ilde Race / Time Is' (Retro Discs),"Twenty-one track pressing of the Idle Race's two lp's mastered onto one CD. Here, you get 'Idle Race' ('69) and 'Time Is' ('71). Overall, the remastering could be a bit better but I didn't think it was awful as others have noted on other sites. As I listened to songs like ""Sea Of Dreams"", ""Mr. Crow And Sir Norman"", ""Hurry Up John"", ""And The Rain"" among others, I soon realized that I was experiencing Jeff Lynn in his pre-Move and Electric Light Orchestra days. I knew I heard of the name Idle Race somewhere - simply didn't know where I heard it. Decent British psychedelic pop, but unless you're a major ELO fan, keep in mind this CD will likely grow old after maybe - say five plays. Asking price is reasonable, though. Personnel: Jeff Lynn - guitar & vocals, Dave Pritchard - guitar, Greg Masters - bass and Roger Spencer - drums. Might appeal to fans of the Strawbs, It's A Beautiful Day, Ron Wood, The Gods, July and maybe Pretty Things."
4,what a pleasant nap!,"This hammock is definitely cotton, and unlike nylon, which disappears when touched with a lit cigar, this hammock has held up well. The fabric is breathable for all but the hottest days and is best left in the shade if you want it to last more than one season. The spreader bars are stout and work well, the finer weaves of Central America are more comfortable to lay on, but this style is good also. You will find it more stable than the latter for 'newbies' to hammock life. It will require some thought about hanging it and getting the appropriate ropes and hardware if what is provided turns out not to be adequate. This is a single size unit and weight recommendations are to be 'heeded'. Also, if you are the 6'6"" or above range I would find a little longer unit. Not recommended for older folks(70-80) and children with sharp instruments. Everyone else should love it. My wife says the colors are great, but I would think that is a subjective consideration."
5,Love it,"This is the second purchase I have made of this hammock. Earlier in the summer, I purchased the blue to hang outside, and now I bought the yellow which compliments my newly recovered patio furniture. It is comfortable and looks great."
2,Comfy... but not made to last,"Piece of ***It's very comfortable, but a couple of weeks of use started to wear down the ropes, until one of them suddenly snapped!"
1,Does not last - bad workmaship or design,The holes in the stretcher boards are not beveled or sanded smooth. After two months the support ropes going through those holes were cut by the action of the wind. I only got to use the hammock four times.
4,Perfect Hammock for a big man!,"This hammock is perfect for a man that over 6ft tall,it is sturdy,comfortable and wide enough to feel secure and stable in,this hammock is AWESOME!"
4,My most durable hammock,"I have purchased a few hammocks before and used them nearly daily. Usually the fabric lasted no more than six months to a year before tearing, and i don't weigh more than 150 lbs. This hammock has been used just as frequently for the past two years with NO fabric wear. Two support ropes have broken but they are easily replaced."
5,"Hammock , Aruba Hybrid bought on Amazon","I know a good hammock , some time ago, living in south Texas , I was engaged in driving long haul truck and would buy hammocas in Mexico, I spent some wondrous naps hanging below the trailer in hot weather swinging in the breeze. From experience I claim this hammock to be the best ever."
5,Hammock to grace a college student's balcony,"I bought this for my college dorm room's balcony. The sun in Southern California is so inviting that you wish you never miss it. With the aruba hammock hanging across my balcony I almost never did. Its comfortable to use in so many positions, especially the standard hammock sleep position. If you're a bit creative you'll also find that you can sit on it just fine. Its only sturdy enough to support the weight of two lightweights, so be careful if you choose to cuddle up with your significant other on it. Its not wide enough to keep you comfortable for long though. Hence, its best to use this for an individual."
2,hammocks,"the photos of hammocks showed them with a pillow. However, as we found out after we received them the pillow was not included. The ad was misleading. Please remove the pillow from the photo so other people don't have the same experience.Unhappy in SeabrookJoe & Jenny Lyons281-326-3911Aruba Hybrid Hammock, Single, Vanilla Yellow"
3,Hammock for One,"Bought this hammock for my husband for X-Mas and found out why it is so cheap. He is the only one that fits in it (185 lbs). So if you think you are getting a bargain for 2, don't bother."
4,canada dry in a perfume bottle,"this is a fun scent. if you like ginger ale, you'll like this. bubbly and fresh. the staying power if not great tho, so you have to keep applying. delivery was fast."
3,Nostalgia,"This was a book I got from Scholastic in 1965, at that time I really enjoyed it but it dissappeared during one of many moves and I had forgotten the title even. But I remembered the stories of the various chapters. I figured out the title a couple months ago and found a used copy on Amazon and ordered it. I can see why I enjoyed it at the age of 9. A nice walk down nostagia lane."
5,An Excellent Memoir with So Much to Tell,"The author articulates the intensely personal elements of both her side of the ""coming out"" as parent, along with the son's side, with such vision. I'd never thought about ""coming out"" as a family experience but the author certainly opened my eyes, and mind, on that. It's a wonderful memoir, full of insights to be pondered and cherished. I recommend it to anyone going through coming out of the closet personally or vicariously, but it ought to be required reading for homophobes."
3,Does not fit 2007 Honda Civic,It either doesnt fit or is the most complicated install process I have ever seen. Went out and bought RainX wipers that went on in 5 minutes.
2,Worse blade I've ever bought,After installing the wipers I got to use them twice. The first time they sqeeked terribly. The second time the blade broke loose from the wiper arm assy. I have to get the truck inspected this week. Now I have to find another wiper. I've never paid this much for a wiper blade. I thought I was getting a quality product. Never will I buy these again.
4,Goodtime music,"This is the perfect goodtime music. It's great for the beach, the car and parties.You just want to turn it up when you hear it!"
5,"If you like ""Hootch"", you'll love the rest of the album!","It's so great to see a local D.C. band boogie into the national spotlight. Check out their other albums (""Sol-id"" & ""Labrador"" are especially good). These guys are GREAT fun live. If you can, catch them at the Bayou before it gets torn down."
5,A Must Have for your collection...,This album is terrific! This is one of those discs that you keep on repeat for a week straight! All of the songs are catchy - definitely worth the money! Check out some of their earlier releases also. It's good to finally see a strong local band get their time in the national limelight!
5,"new, energetic, one can listen to the whole album",The only thing better than an Everything CD is to see them live. South of the Border or in the Bayou in D.C. these guys rock.
1,"""Bad Thing""","Well, it's true that ""Supernatural"" has a way cool intro and that ""Good Thing"" and ""Spent"" have a cool metal edge to them, one of these songs has VERY BAD LANGUAGE at the end. Any cd that has that kind of language in it does not deserve any praise at all. There's nothing new in this cd, anyway, exept boring light-weight stuff. The only other compliment I can give it is that it has a secret song on it, and I think that's cool. But don't buy it. There's nothing you would love or anything on it. Don't buy it."
5,Love it love it love it,"If you've ever heard everything, you know that this cd was an exciting thing for them. Yes, it's a bit overproduced, but you have to be excited for the guys. From the cutesy song of Ladybug to Time Will Heal Me, you'll want to jam, dance, drive, or party with this CD. If you liked it as much as I did, go buy an older CD like Labrador or Solid...hear earlier versions of some of the stuff! They're a great band that's survived for years playing in holes like those on the Eastern Shore in Dewey Beach. And for those of you who have never seen them live - GO TO A LIVE SHOW! The energy is amazing, the fans are so much fun, and the music is better than you can imagine!"
2,Disappointed!,"Coming from someone who used to go see Everything live about 5 years ago, this album shows how going mainstream can kill everything a band stands for. The songs sound strained and unlike the music I used to dance to for hours. I was SO excited when I heard that they had finally been signed, I went right to the store and previewed the CD. THIS IS NOT THEIR BEST WORK. You can totally tell that someone else dictated this album. If you want to hear what Everything is really about, go out and buy their album Solid. Now THAT is what Everything was when I went to see them. I am very disappointed with this CD, and hope that these guys can get back to the music I know that they can play."
5,A Spiritual Experience,"This is as close to perfect a cd can be. If I were on a desert island and could only have 1 cd, this would probably be that cd. The music has the fun of a Reel Big Fish or Santana and the rhythm and rhyme rivaling Ben Harper or Sublime. The lyrics are beautiful. Everything is blended together perfectly. There's not a single bad song on here. The most popular was ""Hooch,"" but its probably actually the weakest song on here, musically, lyrically. The hidden track ""Who Do You Think You Are"" is maybe the best song on the cd. My personal favorites are ""Be Gone,"" ""Good Thing,"" and ""Time Will Heal Me."" Very, very good cd, period. The best obscure cd you'll find."
4,My winter partner,"I live in the NW region, beautiful mountains, ski resorts, endless winter sports, and A LOT of gray skies. I am a self-diagnosed SAD patient. I have lived tropical for the past 20 years, and am now spending my second winter in a row in a climate I'm not used to. I didn't have the light last winter, bad bad winter. I bought the light at the beginning of this winter season, and so far I'm wintering a bit better than last year. That's great news for me, and for my family that has to put up with my moods in the winter. I use the light every morning while I'm getting ready. NOTE: I have noticed that I can't use it past mid afternoon or I won't sleep that night. The directions do explain the best times to use the light, in what capacity and for how long."
5,True believer,So hooked on my happy light I have to use it every morning! Many friends of mine have tried my happy light and were so impressed with how they felt after sitting infront of it for the first time that they also purchased one
4,Family of five enjoying the winter help.,We are enjoying the HappyLite. Our family of five use it by our computer. It is a little large but otherwise we think it helps.
5,Winter sunshine!,I like waking up with this light during the long dark winter. I think it helps. If you are prone to feeling depression on dark short days it might help you too. There seems to be some science behind the design as well. A possible drawback is that its big. But its very bright. So I'm glad i purchased it.
1,"What I received were broken, TWICE!","The first one I received was broken. One bulk wasn't working at all. Then I requested for one replacement. The replacement was still broken. Half of one bulk wasn't working. For me, 200% defective! Too high to trust this product any more!"
3,Verilux HappyLite,I'm sensitive to direct sunlight due to medications I take so it just didn't work for me. Good quality in general
5,Happy Lite for SAD and Depression,"I reviewed many ""Happy Lights"" and found this product the best for my needs. It is one of few I found while googling that emit up to 10,000 LUX which is recommended by psychiatrists to obtain full benefits of the light.I've used this product for one week and already feel it working. I attend college on-line, and am in my room most of the day doing homework. I was having difficulties concentrating and lacked ambition. Verilux's HappyLight Deluxe is changing this. Even when I am chatting with my friends over instant messenger they sense the elevation in my mood!My next purchase will be a smaller, portable Verilux so I can reap it benefits while I am in other areas of the house that don't get enough sunlight."
1,Read the other reviews regarding the lightbulb,Just received the verily. Turned it on for about fifteen minutes and the other bulb went out. I went back to read the reviews of other people. Saw the defect is a common occurrence
3,not what I thought,"I ordered this product because the specs given on the Amazon web sight were that this light gives off 10,000 lux at 12 inches. I was disappointed when I received the light and the product box says the light gives up to 6,000 lux. Is this a case of false advertising or bait and switch?"
4,happylite,I wanted something that looked good and is of decent quality. product has bright light-if that is what you seek.
5,It works. What else do you need?,Hung it on the wall of my window-less office in Seattle. No longer feel like I have to struggle through gloomy winter days.
4,Happy Lite,..this light provides me with the right amount if light that I need to prevent me from being depressed during the the dark days of winter.....highly recommend it !
5,Do You Have SAD? Give This A Try!,"I have been diagnosed with Seasonal Affective Disorder. If I don't spend at least 20 minutes outside in the sun each day, I start feeling sluggish, lethargic, and turn to carbs (which makes me gain weight and then I get depressed). If this sounds all too familiar to you, try using the HappyLight.My doctor advised me to go for a walk every morning; which is the most helpful thing I can do. However, I find it hard to go out in the bitterly cold winter. Also, fish oil, vitamin D, and exercise help a lot. But rainy, dismal days still bring me down. So after researching the science behind full spectrum light therapy (using at least 10,000 LUX) I decided to try the HappyLight. What a difference! After sitting near the light (12 inches away; for an hour early every morning) for only a few weeks, I have WAY MORE ENERGY! I really love the HappyLight and wish I'd tried it much sooner!"
4,Used HappyLite winter of 2003,"I ordered the HappyLite about 4 months before they even shipped the product, because it was the first reasonably priced (and sized) light to help treat SAD. Living in Minnesota, I tend to get depressed in February, so wanted to see if the light would help. Starting in Oct/Nov 2003, I began turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount of time. I did not use it on weekends.Anyway, I think that it helped me keep from sinking so low with the SAD blues in February, but it did not completely keep SAD away. I spent 4 days on the beach in Florida during the 3rd week of February, and that helped the most.I will indeed use the light again this winter, because it helps--but does not eliminate--SAD for me."
3,the verdicts still out.... not what I expected,"I just got my happy light a couple days ago. I guess it is sorta a given (because the light bulbs are florescent), but I thought everyone should know that sitting in front of a happy light is nothing like real daylight. The experience is very artificial. I'm sitting in front of it now-it kinda feels like a trip to Kmart.However, the light is also not as bright as I thought it would be. This could be a good thing because I can still sit at my desk and get work done while using the Happy Light. So far I would have to say that it is better than sitting at a desk with ""regular"" light. I do feel more awake. I'm going to keep an open mind and use the thing every day and then write back later. OOOO if you do decide to get one, check the verilux site first; they are having a special and it is cheaper than on amazon."
5,The Happy Light is my new best friend!,"With equal amounts of skepticism and desperation, I bought Verilux's Happy Light on line. I couldn't be happier. This model is pretty big and sits like a satellite on my desk, but it does the trick.After a few days, I think I mentally fooled myself into thinking it was working. But really, after two weeks, I know it is. When 5 o'clock rolls around, I'm not thinking about putting on my pajamas and calling it a night.It's absolutely worth the money, so if you're feeling tired and worn out from the cold and lack of sun, go for it. Until the snow and cold make their exit, I'll have my morning coffee and check my email with the Happy Light."
1,Disinformation in title / description,"This does not actually mimic sunlight like the product description says. This is only a bright light, it does not generate vitamin D in your skin, which real sunlight does. If this did it would have to emit UV light, which correct me if I'm wrong, it doesn't."
2,Casio Camera Case,"Nice looking case, but it is too large for Exilim M and S series. Also, you cannot take pictures while it is in the case."
5,Perfect size - Excellent quality,"Why Casio doesn't include a case with an expensive camera is beyond me, but this aftermarket purchase was well worth the money. My EX-Z1000 fits perfectly in this nicely padded case. The little magnetic snap hasn't popped open unexpectantly yet, yet it opens readily when desired. The belt loop is large enough to fit almost any sized belt.Decent price, free shipping, good quality product. What else can I say?"
3,good deal for that money,"Good product for that money. i'm somewhat satisfied and would probably recommend this case for exilim casio cameras. It's very easy to access the camera, the camera fits well, and the case is stylish at the same time. however, here are a couple conserns: the leather is kinda too soft and after a couple months it has broke in, making the case look like 2 year old one. another thing is that the camera there is kinda too lose. Eventhough i never droped it our of the case (was even running with it), but still the case could've been more closed on the sides making the camera sit there tighter. later on i saw another case with vertical load and a littel rougher leather, however the price was absolutely out of my range for that product. so, i think i would stick to this one, but keep my eyes open for a better deal."
4,Works fine with the Z850,"Fit is a little on the tight side with my new z850, but that's what I wanted. The magnetic clasp is fine as long as you make sure it ""clicks"" closed. I drop mine into the case upside down so I never accidentally hit the power button (opening the lens inside the case could damage it). Happened to me once, but the camera seems to be fine though."
1,Does NOT fit the EX-Z55!!!,"This case even has to stretch to fit the EX-Z40! The case is nice & small; however, neither a couple of salespeople or I could fit the 55 in."
1,The camera may slip out and drop on the ground,"The bag looks and feels nice but that is all the good I can say about it. I used it during a hike, and twice the camera fell out and dropped on the ground, because the lock easily opens. And when the lock is open the camera falls out as soon as you bow down. Very poor design, only good for show but not under normal use."
3,at least it fits...,"the exilim ex-Z70 fits in it well. no strain on the stitching. the sides, which you cannot tell by the picture, is exposed (about 2/3 of the height of the camera from the top). although i haven't dropped my camera yet, i'm sure the sides will be vulnerable... everywhere else the padding is great. there a two small pockets on the flap cover for additional SD cards, a pocket on the inside front where i keep a cleaning cloth, and a belt loop on the back."
5,Satisfied,"The case is small and compact but offers fine protection for the camera. The design is pretty niffty as is has opening for the camera loop to be on your wrist. Latchappears to be ok, but I need further experience with it."
4,above avg case,"the only thing I don't like about this case is the price, it's a little high for its material and finish, but overall it's not a bad case to carry around."
2,Casio camera casing,"Funtional, handy but the button is not easy to lock, so you get worry all the time, when you have it on your belt.But price wise is the best, so maybe you are paying for what you are getting."
5,Perfect choice,I purchased this case after reading the reviews. It was a perfect choice for my camera. I'm very happy.
2,"NEW ALBUM, SAME SONGS","I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE CRUE PUT THIS ALBUM OUT, IT REMINDS ME OF KISS. IF YOU OWN DECADE OF DECADENCE, THEN WAIT TILL A FRIEND HAS THE ALBUM AND RECORD BITTER PILL AND ENSLAVED. THE NEXT THING THAT THE CRUE ARE GOING TO DO IS PUT OUT A LIVE ALBUM WITH YOU GUESSED IT......THE SAME SONGS ON IT. THIS GREATEST HITS ALBUM DOES NOT INCLUDE ANYTHING OFF OF THE SELF TITLED MOTLEY CRUE ALBUM WITH JON CORABI,""WHICH IS BY FAR A SUPERIOR ALBUM TO GENERATION"". ARE THESE GUYS BROKE OR WHAT, WITH THE RERELEASE OF ALL THEIR PREVIOUS RECORDINGS WITH UNHEARD OF DEMOS AND RECORDINGS, THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FAN FRIENDLY AND RELEASED TWO OR THREE ALBUMS WITH UNHEARD OF MUSIC ON IT SUCH AS THE IMPORT CALLED QUARTERNARY RELEASED IN 1994. DON'T GET ME WRONG, I HAVE SEEN SIXX AND CO. 11 TIMES, THEY ARE BY FAR THE BEST LIVE SHOW ON EARTH, BUT STOP RELEASEING ALBUMS WITH THE SAME SONGS ON THEM, ALA KISS."
2,Greatest of What?,"Mediocrity at it's best from a highly overrated and self centered band. Dr. Feelgood and Girls, Girls are ok rock party songs but no better than offerings from less glorified acts (and I do mean ""acts"" because no one takes them seriously but themselves) like Poison and Whitesnake. And these posers will never ever be in the same league as true rock royalty such as Aerosmith and Van Halen."
1,Was this album necessary?,"I don't understand why they released this. Most of these songs are on Decade of Decadance, and I would think most Crue fans already have that. They should have released a live album or a collection of rarities and ""b-sides"" instead of just re-releasing the same songs again."
1,We do not need yet another compilation disc!,"Of all the things the boys could have worked on while T-bone was doing his time, this is not it. Only one Vince release since Decade, and then another ""Hits"" disc? Apparantly this release gives a reason to go on tour. The 2 songs are pretty good, but with the original albums and Decade, this means that many songs have been released for a THIRD time! THEN, all individual albums will be released again next year with extra songs on each (making a FOURTH time that some songs will be released). Would it not have been a better deal for the fans to simply release a ""b-sides"" disc? Come on, guys! LONG LIVE THE MOTLEY/CORABI ALBUM"
5,how to do just about anything on a computer,"I bought this book because every time I went to the libary to check it out, it was already checked out. I like having my own copy to refer to. the book had a lot of helpful info. in it."
1,Review of Remote Viewing course,"I purchased the ""Remote Viewing: Gold Standard Course"" and was not impressed. The sound quality of the DVD's was poor and, since I have bad hearing anyway, I could not hear most of the speakers. One of the DVD's was actually blank. One of the CD's was also blank. I had to return the set and am still waiting for my refund money. The whole experience was awfull."
4,"A good collection, even for those who don't practice law!","I have this, both of the Cat, the Dog, the Doctor (and Psychiatrist), Business, and True Love cartoon books in this ""New Yorker"" series. I hopefully will soon acquire the Money one. Anyway, this particular title is humerous indeed. It's full of the trials and tribulations (pun intended) of the attorney's profession, quite appropriately showcased here. I recommend it highly, as well as the aforementioned books too!"
3,film,"the picture value is amazing, however, when putting into a reel for development, it became slippery and mega scratched. o_0"
5,Price,Ilford is excellent and I love both the film and the paper. That being said it's a bit pricey when ordering through amazon. B&H is much cheaper. $3.99 a roll for 100 and $3.79 for 400 sp/d. The paper tends to be a better deal too but mostly if you order boxes with 100 sheets or more. Great products though.
5,Dude Diaper Bag,"Great diaper bag. This is the first baby for my daughter and son-in-law and he is a total Dude, so this will work great for him."
3,o.k. for pop...,"well i gotta say. i'm not that big of a ""pop"" fan...b-sides avril lavigne. but this was pretty good. i 1st heard it a couple weeks ago on much and just thot Hillary Duff was just getting cocky. but my nieces were watching the Lizzy McGuire movie today and i decided to download this song. although i personally like her other song ""What Dreams are Made Of"" but this is good too. but it seems her voice is a bit too mature for a 14 year old...i could be wrong, but is it ACTUALLY Hillary Duff singing? just wonderin' ok well,l8er"
1,hilary who,hilary duff is a unbeat untalented and nobody she is a terrible song righter and singer I think her cd is awful and makes no scence!!
2,"""Why Not"" is ""So Yesterday""!","Okay, chances are, nobody around here is going to want to hear ""Why Not"". It's a thing of the past. But I still think this single deserves a review, so here it goes. ""Why Not"" is a catchy song, better then some of Hilary's current songs. It has a good beat, and a...slightly good moral. While it talks about ""following your heart"", it also talks about breaking the rules.I personally think that Hilary Duff is a big phony, and she makes me sick. She's trying so hard to be a ""bad girl"" that she looks like an idiot! The reason Hilary and Avril Lavigne don't get along, I think, is because Hilary is copying Avril so much. She's trying to break away from her ""Lizzie McGuire"" image, even though many more people liked her then. I think Hilary just wants money, and she's trying everything to get it. I mean, come on, Hilary and Haley! Do you really, honestly think you're going to be the next Mary-Kate and Ashley? Please!"
1,Why not....put down the burger and exercise?,"Hmm.....why not take a crazy chance? why not do a crazy dance? why not shut the hell up with corny lyrics? Why not cover Hilary Duff with a paper bag (oh yeah....her fat blubbery body wouldn't fit in one), why not put Hilary Duff in a coma and stop feeding her until she loses 30 lbs? Or....Hilary why not drop the food and drop the pounds??? Why not get Hilary Duff off my TV?? Off my radio???? Oh yeah... and I had a question.... how much money does it take to feed that 300 lb whale??? People should nickname her her MONSTRO!! I hate Hilary Duff...and her computer generated voice. ""I can't wait"" til she dies of heart disease from eating her big macs. Hilary Duff sucks and always will. Don't buy her cd. Save a cow.... just make sure its not named Hilary Duff!"
4,Good reinterpretations by original artist,"Although this CD does not contain the original recordings of Eric Burdon & The Animals, it should be appreciated on its own merits. Eric Burdon's voice is nearly as strong as it was on the original recordings. I don't consider any of the tracks on this CD to be duds. Eric Burdon's renderings of the Animals' hits stay close to the originals while differing enough to make the experience interesting. I also cannot find any fault with his backing group on this CD. Again, the arrangements stay close to the originals while not simply trying to parrot them. Re-recordings are often poor substitutes (IMHO) but definitely not in this case. I enjoyed these songs when I bought them in the 60's and still enjoy them today in both their original form as well as their remakes on this CD."
1,Grade Z re-recordings,"Although this CD appears to be the most complete collection of music from Sixties hitmakers Eric Burdon and the Animals, it is comprised of inferior re-recorded versions of their major hits."
5,Great CD!,"Went to see Eric in Hammond, La and it was fantastic and so is this CD, brought back lots of memories!"
5,Deadline --- A Great Read,"A fresh and inside look at the newspaper business from an unique vantage point of a young, unspoiled writer. Great read and great insights!"
2,Nothing Substantial,"This book is beneficial only to those readers who have never managed a software development project. The author essentially provides a high-level overview of the project management processes used at Infosys, an organization which reached CMM level 5. The book lacks any real substance and I walked away from it feeling I hadn't learned anything new.One would be better served picking up a copy of PMI's PMBOK to learn about coherent project management processes."
2,The Worst of Liberal Journalism,"This book is a problem. It presents itself as book in the public interest, but it really does a disservice to the public. Gigantic corporations reaping billions of dollars off propaganda machines of immense proportion--this story should NOT be humanized or told in such simple form. Liberal journalists are the ones who will faithfully detail how and why your flesh is being flayed off your body by the corporate-government elite. Thank you, very much. By presenting all sides, we get no ground to stand upon, no point of view. We get some critical remarks tossed off next to corporate jargon about competition. Problem is, Aufderheide should have long agon seen beyond such a lame category as ""competition."" If you want to see a real journalist in action, watch Bill Moyers examination of the 1996 telecommunications act in a video you can probably get at your library."
2,Outdated information,I bought this book along with the one by Gary Eldred.Eldred's had much more up to date info.This book was full of stats from the mid to late 1990s even though it was written in 2002.He never fully goes into the tax benefits of Real Estate especially 1031 exchanges etc.He bought his condos at a high interest rate making his payments higher and thus affecting his formula on how to know if you are getting a good deal or not.I can not reccomend this book.
3,Okay,I thought it was pretty generic. I have read a bunch of other books though and was looking for some new theories or ideas and didnt get that here. it would be good for someone who hasnt read anything yet to understand basic concepts.
2,this+that-this = profit....bla bla bla,"This book is great for someone with no knowledge of real estate investing. I was hoping for something more detailed and useful. I already own a house which i rent out entirely and was considering condo's as an alternative and this book didn't really teach me anything i didn't already know. eg... for the most part is was ""this + that - this = profit""."
2,Outdated & advice very anecdotal,"Author provides advice based on the seven condo properties he's personally bought in the Seattle area in the mid-70's to 80's. As someone who lives in the same market I can tell you the ROI percentages and new purchase guidelines provided haven't been applicable here in a long time. The book is useful if you want the author's personal reasons for investing in condo's vs. other investments. He sees them as low hassle/risk v. reward and gives his reasoning. Of course, the numbers to back it up are outdated too. An interesting read but if you're looking for sophisticated investment advice or concrete steps you can use in today's market you may want to look elsewhere."
5,The one guide you need to invest in condominiums,"This book is the one investment book I recommend for everyone, and certainly the one book for investing in condominiums. In concise and thorough detail, Andris Virsnieks lends his own personal experience to show not only how to get started in investing in condominiums, but explains how if properly researched they are a superior investment to apartments, the stock market, and other more time-consuming and volatile investments. This book is free of superfluous bull and get rich quick schemes, but is instead focusing on steady monthly cash flows with little maintenance through good property management. A great book."
4,The best is yet to come!,"This LP epitomizes what I do not undertsand about Sony. JM put an LP out around 1970, it was a two-fer. One side conducted/arranged and written by Bert Kaemphert. ""The Lady Smiles"" ""Strangers In The Night"" and ""The Time Will Come"" is only slightly more fantastic than ""Spanish Eyes"" or ""Don't Stay"" or ""If There's A Chance"" will melt you. The second was similarly recorded with Burt Bacharach of his infamous catalog of golden oldies. Now Sony sees fit to put an album of some promise like this one and a few buy it, yet these LP's are virtually unheard of on CD let alone heard of..more by absence than its worth to the collection of this master's voice. If you see it in any format BUY it! In the meantime get this one too!Why am I wasting your time? Listen to exceprts of this album anywhere you can and you'll know!"
1,Where has the Great Mathis gone?!,"It is incredible that one of the most gifted voices from America dedicates an entire album to such inexpressive compositions. Comparing to his glorious past, it seems that Mathis looks desperately for another smash hit that would re-launch his career. Surely this is not the way."
5,love my shoes,"I just love my new New Balance shoes. They are really comfortable and I love the color. They were a Christmas gift. ""Love em"" mary:)"
4,Sporty and affordable!,My daughter really loves these shoes and tells me they are great for exercising in the gym at school. Her only complaint is that they are sized just a little small. An extra 1/2 size is probably a good idea if you tend to need a little extra room for long distance running. Great buy!
5,New Balance 1060,"These have been the very best jogging shoes I have ever worn. I am tempted to buy a spare pair so I will have them again when these wear out. What a joy to run in these shoes. The color is so sweet as well. Good job, New Balance!!Susie"
1,"Good Emma Lange story- not her best, though","If you like Mary Balogh's books, you will enjoy Emma Lange. I find that when I'm reading their books, I sometimes get the authors mixed up. The characters in this book are likeable and the love story is good; I wanted a stronger ending, though. I prefer Lange's, Exeter's Daughter or better yet, The Irish Rake."
2,Very over rated,"The first part of the book provides a good history of Logistics but over rates the purported military genius of Desert Storm - the truth was that they shipped too much stuff and things that were not needed at a great expense and ended up leaving it to rot...not much expertise needed to waste the taxpayer's money.The rest of the book is a rehash of well known SCM principles and is a terrible way to try to get these across. It is page after page of text, with no diagrams of the ""system"" that the author is trying to get across, but I suspect that the system may not really make sense if constructed and that is why it is not...baffle the readers with text.If you do not know anything about SCM, this is a good intro, but I was greatly disappointed in this book, especially in light of the glowing reviews that this received."
2,"OK book, nothing new.","I purchased this book because I am pursuing a masters degree in the logistics field. Its kind of flimsy and not very interesting. There are a lot of military quotes and references included. I think that the author relied heavily on a collection of military history books. Not very original or inspiring. The only reason that it gets two stars from me is that I used it on a paper that I wrote, so yes, you can get some good reference material from it. But not much else. I would try to find Pagonis' ""Moving Mountains"" if you want a good military logistics book."
2,Disappointing,"Very vague on current practices, including the author's. That's not sufficient even for an introductory book."
4,"Great addition to ""My First Dollhouse"" (Plan Toys)","I purchased this set for my 3 y.o on her birthday. She had received the Plan Toys My 1st Dollhouse earlier this year and seemed ready to furnish it (even though an odd assortment of little dolls and stuffed animals reside there.)Plan Toys delivers a quality product - sturdy, great colors...the only bit with this ""modern"" set is that my daughter can't tell what some of the items are as they tend to be a bit abstract looking...but she plays with them in her own way and hopefully will have these products as longer-term playthings...it really seems as though they won't be outgrown for a while..."
3,Magazine fine; buying from Amazon...,"The magazine is fine; I'd been a subscriber for several yrs but my subscription had lapsed. I decided to buy from [...]. When it finally started arriving, I got 3 old issues within a week. I'm not sure if this was a problem with Amazon or what, but I never had that problem with my directly bought subscription to AJN."
2,need something to revew,"I would love to review this product....if I had it to review. I ordered it over a month ago and have yet to receive anything. Granted I haven't done the leg work to try and find out why, but as we all know in this profession...we are busy! I would like to not have to search for my purchase. I give it an extra star just because I anticipate that I'll like it....when I finally get it."
2,"Journal is ok, LWW publisher = inept !!","I agree with the Bradshaw review. I too subscribed for supposedly three years, but still cannot access online. Also got back issues from 4-6 months before subscribing. The LWW company is poorly organized. I had only confusing, inconsistent, and simply wrong information when trying to straighten out my account with the LIPPINCOTT publisher. Do NOT buy from them !!"
1,Political or Practical,If you are more interested in political aspects of nursing and in rare and obscure diseases this magazine is for you. If you want to learn more about common conditions and disease processes I would recommed Nursing Made Incredibly Easy or RN magazines. This magazine focuses on the more experienced nurse practicioner and requires you to have a broad knowledge base. If you are a new grad or have little clinical experience this may leave you looking for more answers to your own questions than giving you what little time you have in a day to learn something. Keep the medical dictionary and references nearby.
2,I am dissapointed with the 2 years of AJN I got,"Every once in a while, there will be an article gem.Overall, this magazine is not for me. It is full of advertising, and what content there is left to fill the pages is like reading a sociology and poetry magazine.I have not been able to really use anything out of my AJN. A lot of fluff and no meat. The ribbon that wraps this up in a ""don't do"" package is the fact that their customer service STINKS (anyone able to find a phone number?). They screwed up my bill on a book I ordered, sent me a bunch of previously published magazines when I ordered a subscription... It's like there's 5 people that run the whole company."
3,Lovers' Concerto Misses the Mark,"Although the male actor falls in love ""at first sight"" with one of the two female characters, by some twist the THREE become close friends, making the viewer wonder where the plot is going. I don't think I'd be giving too much of it away to tell you that both girls are sick, so the story becomes slower and more sad to the point of becoming boring despite the sympathy felt for them. I've seen many sad Korean dramas which held my attention while I used tissue after tissue, but this wasn't one of them, and I can't tell you exactly why. If you want to check it out and tell me where I'm wrong, please do so, but I could recommend many others if you want a good cry with a great story."
4,VH1 Diva-To-Be,"Rarely does one hear a debut album that could be followed up successfully in so many different directions. Neko can deliver a bouncy pop hook (Butterfly Girl and the Chinese version of the Yao Song), channel Karen Carpenter or early Olivia Newton John (So In Love, 3 Little Words, Friend) and -- my favorite -- adopt the smoky, sultry chanteuse (Tangled, Delirious). If you want to discover a new crossover artist before she goes into heavy rotation on VH1, buy this album now."
2,Nice Effort...,"I just heard Neko singing today. She can sing (did a great job with ""God Bless America""), but this collection of songs does not show that. She tries to be unique and clever in terms of lyrical content (""You cause this Wanton Desire / to Dim Sum lights and Szechuan fire"") but fails, appearing eccentric in lyrics and cliche in style. The music is lacking (except for the beautiful ""Colors of the Wind""). Could have been much much better, but it was a nice effort so I'll be generous and give it two stars."
5,Writings of a great reader,"In ""How To Read a Book"" Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren describe the fourth level of reading. Synoptical reading challenges the reader who, having carefully and thoroughly understood several individual works, strives to hear the conversation of their ensemble. ""Labyrinths"" brings us the dreamlike reflections of Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges's profoundly synoptical reading. Borges heard the conversation of writers across cultures, centuries, languages, genres. Then he came back to outline over and over the one nearly infinite and unattainable truth in these stories, essays, and parables.Yet Borges's writings remain humble and personal. With the voice of a shy, erudite uncle, Borges recounts magical reveries that came to him deep in the stacks of some dim basement of the library. Throughout the text the reader feels at once the quiet loneliness of the bookworm, the presence of the immortal, and the terrible portents in the twilight rustling of leaves."
3,Replete with spelling errors,"Both the back cover and James E. Irby claim to have revised this current edition; in the postscript to his original introduction Mr Irby states ""this new revised edition...corrects misprints and other minor errors,"" if such a revision has taken place Mr Irby's eyesight must now resemble that of Borges when he was in his fifties because the book is filled with errors.I'll admit it doesn't detract too much from enjoying the work but for the book to go through thirty-five printings with later additions/ editing and to still be like this?Come on. Someone must not be taking their job seriously as a proofreader.Aragentine, happly are two that come to mind though there are a dozen others.The ""invitation"" by William Gibson is forgettable and adds little if anything to the work."
4,The bibliography is a lie!,"The back cover of this book glibly promises ""a biographical and critical introduction, as well as an extensive bibliography."" The introduction is there, but you will search this volume in vain for the slightest hint of a bibliography, extensive or otherwise. JLB's stories are excellent, but if you're expecting the promised extensive bibliography, prepare to be bitterly disappointed."
5,Rod Sterling on Steroids,"Imagination, the Lord of Universe say mystics, poets, artists and every rebel for freedom, is hanging on the walls of this labyrinth like masterpieces in a museum of parables of desire and the whisperings of spirits telling stories that were lost for centuries on the dark side of the moon. This is a book that should be on somebody's list of greats:100 greatest ever or 1,000 greatest or whatever - see if it makes your list."
4,Something You Have to Settle Into,"Borges is like coffee (and I am aware at how he would cringe at such a hackneyed comparison)--he is difficult to become accustomed to, but soon part of your life. He wanders behind me, always there, and bits of his stories resurface constantly in my other readings and experiences. Fiercely intelligent, with a wit that transcends the sometimes clumsy translations, he is an original, a major literary voice."
4,A mixed collection,"Like most collections, the contents have a mixed quality. This is a collection of short stories, essays, and parables. Some of the short stories are in the traditional mystery format, and some are philosophical discussions. The stories tend to be on the dark side. Overall, the collection will appeal more to students of literature than to the average reader. Borges was very creative in developing original plots."
3,Ok condition. One page was highlighted.,"It was advertized as a new book, but there was a paragraph highlighted in the middle of the book with a yellow highlighter. Very strange. All else was OK."
1,An example of the King's New Clothes ?,"I have read and enjoyed a wide variety of literature in my lifetime, but never before have I found such rubbish masquerading as itellectual work. David Bickford. UK."
4,Good Live Gig,"I've been a Neko Case fan since my daughter mentioned her to me a few years ago. This CD is an Austin City Limits broadcast that showcases her strong singing and a tight band. The songs are well-chosen and solidly performed with humor and passion. My only complaint is that a few of the songs also show up on her other live album, The Tigers Have Spoken (?) in virtually the same arrangements, but if you've missed that LP, this one is every bit as good."
4,Very interesting style,"Neko Case offers an interesting approach to popular music and progressive country. Having heard her latest album, Fox Confessor, I was eager to see her live. This DVD was my next best opportunity. She played with a small ensemble of tight musicians and a back-up singer, and they played surprisingly well, if not dramatic. Neko seemed extremely nervous on the Austin City Limits stage, and she admits to being over-joyed to be on the program. Nonetheless, she was very adept at playing her music, which is a mix of country, folk, and light jazz-rock. It will be interesting to see where she goes from here. I would recommend this performance if you haven't seen Neko case, or even if you haven't heard her music. She is a very interesting singer."
1,skimpy considering it is described as a velour luxury towel,How this merchant has received such terrific reviews is beyond me. I got these two towels to dry my dog hoping they would be luxury thick velour towels but it is simply terry with no added thickness and I am going to donate these two towels to the Animal Rescue League for their use - I spent $29 due to their shipping fees being added and am very angry - the so called embroidery is a thick stiff applique type attachment - absolutely disgraceful in my opinion - the true luxury towels are worth the extra money surely.
5,Darling little book,"I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. I had trepidations about a moose with a moustache, but it turned out to be hilarious. My 5 and 3 year olds were laughing hysterically. I ended up buying a bunch of these from Scholastic and giving them as neighbor gifts."
3,"Well, boo.","A lovely story, but the improper apostrophe use has me wanting to burn this book. Or get a new editor and get it republished."
3,Holidays!,It was about 5 moose that couldn't find a Christmas tree. It was okay. I rate it three stars.
2,Only an Average Book,"I've read Anderson before and was pleased with his writing. However, I'm not as impressed with this book. The book is meant to be a look at how Jesus was ""available, sensitive, helpful, and creative."" All the Biblical texts are from the Gospel of John. Frankly, after reading the first two chapters I thought, ""Anderson makes a few good applications, but he sure had to stretch the text of John to get them."" I can't help but think my M.Div. profs would be disappointed if I wrote something like this. Sorry to say that I'm not sure the rest of the book is any better than chapters 1 & 2."
5,This is the best item i have purchased yet,"I purchased this for our many cats several months ago. It is wonderful. I got to chose my colors and the seller did keep in touch with us throught the ordering and building process of this item. I received an email response to every email i sent to this seller.The condo arrived on the date expected. It has been several months since we purchased this and our cats just love this condo. It is the best one i found online. They do make shorter ones in this same style, but we specifically wanted it for 3 of our cats that are inside during the day and are kenneled at night. It gave them each a very roomy place to sleep and lay, plus the house below was extra for the visting cats and play time.This is wonderful. I can't say enough good about the item or the seller. I am not looking to buy another one of these for another room."
4,Very good!,"Well, After John Belushi's death, the Blues Brothers are never been the same, but James Belushi is a good one for the band, so this CD is better than ""Live In Montreaux"" and really better than ""Red, White And Blues"". Buy it, it's a good album!"
5,Sweet Romance,"The love between Elizabeth and Dickon is so sweet and tender, and even though I always cry at the end, this book lifts my spirits. While there is a bit of intrigue, it isn't a thriller. This book should be read when you want to curl up in a comfy chair on a rainy day and feel warm."
5,Absoulutely wonderful.,"This book...was excellent. I loved it, Lady Elizabeth Hayward(Robin) and Dickon were fantastic. Tori Phillips made me feel as if I were Elizabeth"
1,can you say CHEESY!,i'm wondering why i even read it (all the way through!)because i normaly wouldn't read cheap wanna-be romance books. this book made no sense whatsoever either. she did not have to pretend to be an apprentice she could have easily gone somewhere else to someone else. and the end was incredibly stupid!
4,My son loves it (age 9),My 9 year old thinks its great because you can take off the roof of the plane and put the people in and give them snacks. And you have people in the control tower. It looks like a real airport with waiting area and flowers and the screening process area and even the bridge from the plane to the terminal. The only issue I have is the planes wheels falls off more when you play on a carpet - not bad on a hard surface.
5,Don't listen to the negative reviews!,"If you are an Elizabeth George fan, then you know, no matter what plot or theme, is chosed by EG, you will get a worthy experience.I don't understand all the negative reviews, this book is awesome.One of the best book of 2006. My only regret is I waited so long.Go with all the positive reviews, and settle down to be swept away by some very interesting characters.SPOILER:::It will change your perspective on who shot Helen."
5,What came before he shot her,"This book is not the typical Lynley, but it is well written and the characters are well formed. Although this is not a happy novel, it really is more of what really goes on. I found myself even after I'd finished the book wanting to know what happened to them after that last page was turned.If you read for the pure happiness factor, this book isn't for you."
1,What Came Before He Shot Her,"I am a huge fan of Elizabeth George and eagerly await each new Lynley mystery; however, I have to say this book was a complete departure from her previous works. About a third of the way through I quit reading. I don't mind some sex, violence, drugs etc. but when this is all the book is about, forget it!"
2,Very slow,"I love Inspector Lynley books but this one is very, very boring. Took me forever to get through it. I was disappointed needless to say."
2,200 pages too long,"I was tempted to stop reading in the early part of the book, but forced myself to continue - a 12 hour plane ride will do that! The book would have had more impact if it was 200 pages shorter: The prelude was on the point of being tedious, with the incessant piling on of troubled youth, an insane mother, oversexed black women and a dilect that was difficult to read, and the undeveloped poetic genius of an 11 year old boy. Do all poor London people, blacks as well as Arab, talk like this? - The denouement was anticlimatic, with it's almost ""Law and Order"" fading out before resolution is presented. I assume that this is merely a way of leading into a sequal."
3,I read on and on.....,"I hated this book yet I could not put it down. Ms. George opened our eyes to another world that most of us never see.She is too long winded. Thee are too many ""same old, same old"" parts to the book. The book does not have an ending that most readers will enjoy.I could not put it down.....yet, I wanted it to end."
2,A Disappointment,"I read this with my book club and opinions were mixed; some loved it and others hated it. One of our club didn't even finish it. This book definitely conjured up strong feels among our readers.As a fan of Elizabeth George, I was disappointed in this one. It is not a book I will recommend to friends and I will never consider re-reading it.I did not like the dialogue and found it hard to understand at times. I found the plot line frustrating. The only central character with redeeming qualities falls to the tempations of the streets.This is not one of my favorites."
2,"what dull and really, really wrong?","Be warned before you buy: George's newest book is not a mystery. Nor does it have any of her standard characters.Instead, George wants to examine the events that lead up to a murder. This is like asking how evil happens. In someone else's hands, this could have been a breathtaking book. But George can't think outside of cliches.Nietzche's response to good and evil was to deny that either existed, since there has to be a God for there to be a right and wrong, and Nietzche claimed God was dead. George agrees, to an extent. At least here she argues that the murder was no one's fault, really. Everybody involved simply had these awful, compelling reasons. It's the cry of every burglar and murderer and cheater in the world. ""It just happened! I didn't mean for it to happen!""George preens over her ready sympathy and deep insight into the tragic lives of these characters. Her readers get to suffer through this long, bad, silly novel."
1,I won't read it,"I was a loyal Elizabeth George fan for many many years, but the brutal and rather pointless murder of one of the most sympathetic characters in the last book made me so angry that I tossed the thing out. I guess that I'm being stupidly sentimental, but if I want to get really depressed and read about disadvantaged, messed up and deprived people who murder senselessly, I can watch the news. I won't read this, or any other Elizabeth George books. I know that she's a good writer and will probably not suffer too much from losing my support, but I gotta protest this somehow!"
3,Too long...left hanging...,"I kept plugging away at the story, waiting for Inspector Lynley to appear, and slogging my way through the patois, that I found somewhat annoying and getting in the way, inn't? But I did want to find out what happened to the family so continued through the 400 pages or so until the bitter end, literally. Then, of course, the circle closed. I think it was a clever idea--but still leaves questions. I assume the next book will pick up the two tales (the previous book re the murder) and take us forward. At least I hope so. What will happen to Kendra? To Ness? and of course to Joel and Toby? We can't just leave them out there alone. And what about the bad guys? and Ivan? Maybe Inspector Lynley and Havers can come to everyone's rescue. Too many unanswered questions for characters whose lives took up a lot of my time."
1,Skip this,"Let me see...a sociological novel by an American west-coast author about blacks living in London? Well, OK. But within the ouevre of Lynley, don't bother to read this. Personally, I tossed it aside half-way through and went to reading a history of the battle of Antietam. I got bored."
4,Not Lynley But Stands On It's Own,It took me about a year to warm to reading this book. I was mad that George decided to write this novel. I wanted only to read about Havers and Lynley and how they were coping with the devastating death of Helen and her baby. But this book was a pleasant surprise. It was intriguing and well plotted. I enjoyed it very much and I found that I have a better knowledge of the city in which Havers and Lynley operate.
1,Save your money!!!1,SOOO disappointed in this book. Wish I could get a refund. Elizabeth George should be ashamed to pass something like this off on her fans! As far as I'm concerned I won't be buying anymore of her books!!
5,Enjoy a good mystery? This series is for readers like us.,"I have been enjoying the Lynley/Havers series of books and am reading them in order. The local library is missing some titles and I can always find the missing ones at Abe Books or Amazon. The cost is very reasonable and I keep each book for as long as I wish, then donate it to the library to help complete their collection. Most have been hard cover but even the paperbacks have arrived quickly and in great condition. Anyone who likes a good mystery should try this series! I've been hooked since a friend recommended the first one."
4,so powerful,This book felt so real to me. I felt strongly for the characters. it's very sad but that only gives me more reason to love it. The writing style was a bit strange but it was easy enough for me to get past.
1,Neither Fish Nor Fowl,"I am so glad I borrowed rather than bought What Came Before He Shot Her. I have been a fan of George's writing till now, but after this tome I'll proceed with caution. If George had stuck to the story, which certainly had plenty of tension, rather than breaking it with her sociological asides, it would have been much better. I got really tired of her explaining in depth why Ness reacted the way she did, how Kendra felt, etc.Aren't writers constantly told ""show, don't tell?"""
2,"Terribly tedious, slow moving and generally boring","There is no doubt that Elizabeth George is a marvelous writer. I have previously read and own all of her novels. Prequels can be interesting reads in many cases, but this isn't one of them. Writing in dialect is a dangerous chance a writer takes because it makes for a difficult, often boring read. This novel is 548 pages of tedious dialect representative of a lower class that is well done enough to draw us into the sad story and begin to understand how they speak. I'm sorry but it is much more than I want to know. As a mystery buff, I read for enjoyment and the suspense of the story--NOT in order to raise my social consciousness. This novel is NOT a good choice for a fan of George's work. I wish I hadn't bought it."
2,Dreary and didactic,"I give this book 2 stars instead of one because the author's intentions are good and she tried something different -- a star for boldness.Unfortunately it just doesn't work. She piles woes on her dysfunctional family until Job looks like a lucky winner by comparison. But she fails to make us care very much about any of them. If ever a novel induced ""compassion fatigue"" this was it.I hope she returns to the tried and true in her next novel. It may be formulaic but it works."
1,Welcome to the Sewer,"This book follows three children of London's underclass from their precarious perch on the edge of society through their descent into hell. The family's limited options and bad choices end up becoming just a painful (and far too long) litany of one bad experience after another.While it is well written, it's just too depressing. A couple hundred pages might have worked, but who has the stamina to stay engaged with this tragic family for the full 700+ pages? I certainly didn't!Save yourself some heartbreak and find something else to read."
1,A Long Sad,"WHAT CAME BEFORE HE SHOT HER by Elizabeth George was a title I let slip to the bottom of the pile because it was so thick and had fine print. I finally ""almost"" read it. The one thing Ms. George lacked was a firm editor, the story is an overkill and maked the ""suspend belief"" necessary for every fiction reader impossible -- too much and too much of it.A sad disappointment and I know its reception by the public was a blow to this fine writer, but it was a good idea that just didn't work.Nash Black, author whose mysteries are available in Kindle editions.HaintsWriting as a Small Business"
1,Horribly unbalanced,"I usually enjoy Elizabeth George quite a lot but typically she inserts hersick characters among some normal ones. In this it's one horrible sick person after another. One pities the innocent children who are emotionally abused page after page. I admit to barely being able to get a hundred pages in but I couldn't inflict myself with her morbid story with no relief in sight. If you're a contented person and would like to be terribly depressed, this is the ticket! Skip it and try any other Elizabeth George work."
1,Pointless,"A pointless book to explain a pointless murder in a previous book. This was a very sad story, and one that needed to be told, but it really could've been done in far fewer pages. The character of Joel didn't flesh out to me though. He was too street smart to fall for everything the Blade was having him do. That just didn't make sense to me, that he would be completely blinded by the needed to protect his family. He knew how things worked. His actions didn't ring true in a book that was supposed to deliver a searing truth."
2,No Lynley to be found,"After waiting excitedly for the next installment of the Lynley mystery series, I grabbed this book without bothering to read reviews. Guess what? No Lynley. Just a depressingly grim, not very well-written diatribe about dysfunctional families. It's full of lurid details but nary a mystery in sight. You can bet I'll check out George's reveiws for her NEXT book before I waste money on another clunker."
1,Hockey Pucks have more personality.....,"What a shameful waste of paper, this writing falls so far short of George's ability as a novelist, one would wonder if she really was at the pen. Boring, beginning to end, not enough oomph to keep awake for an entire chapter if used for bedtime reading. London slang was never this uncolourful until George's coined gutterspeak blossomed in triplicate monotonously throughout the book. Moving to Seattle must have put the author into a depressed mode, thumbs down, moving on to someone consistent after this disaster....."
3,What Came Before He Shot Her,"I am disappointed at her work. Others were great detective pieces. I kept waiting in this work for something to happen, I'm 100 pages until the end and it isn't so suspense filled. It seems more soap than mystery. I'm disappointed"
2,Disappointing,"I feel like I just completed a textbook from a college class. I miss the characters from George's previous books. This book is fine for some, as I see from previous reviews, but I had a very difficult time and ended up skipping about 75 pages to get to the end. Please bring back the characters we love!"
2,Take an antidepressant before trying to read this!,"While the author takes the reader deeply into the lives of a dysfunctional family, this stark look at the reality of their lot in life is depressing and unentertaining. With no story, there are only descriptions of events that lead to an appalling crime, that I suppose tie into some other book she has written. Perhaps having read that book would make this one more interesting, but maybe that is a long shot. It could have been meant to be a psychological study of what could make a child behave in unlawful ways, but it just took too long to do it. When I finished the book, my only thought was that I had wasted too many hours. Just a note - this book is riddled with street slang from Britain, and some of it is a reach for the typical American reader. I cannot recommend such a dreary book."
1,bleak and pointless,"Wow. Perhaps this is intended to be a social commentary, but as a novel it is not entertaining at all. Just depressing. There was no real point in killing off Helen - Mrs Lynley - in the first place, now was there? I believe that Elizabeth George should perhaps stop worrying about being a great writer of the modern condition and stick to writing good murder mysteries."
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited when the new Elizabeth George book was out. I found the beginning of the book engaging. However, after a few hundred pages I was fed up with the characters and the story. This book was way too long. I also think George was floundering with her story line. It just didn't hold together. I was really disappointed in this book and wouldn't recommend it."
2,Disappointed,"Elizabeth George is one of my favorite authors. I have read all of her books and buy them as soon as they come out. I was disappointed with this book as the story was about what happened before she was shot. The entire story was about the boy and his life, nothing about the murder or the investigation. Also, the book was hard to read as it is written in London street talk. I would recommend skipping this one."
3,interesting...,"I knew this book wasn't going to be about Lynley because I heard Elizabeth George talking about it, so I wasn't disappointed in this way.However, it was a hard book to read, mainly because the subject matter was so depressing. I kept hoping for something to go right for this beleaguered family and nothing ever did.I also didn't like the author intrusion, when I felt as if I was being told what to think, rather than letting the characters show me themselves. I had to keep reading though, because despite everything, Ms George is an amazing writer. I'm looking forward to finding out what happens to Joel."
2,extreme effort,"That is what it took on my part to finish this book - extreme effort. I would love to have seen this murder solved, but not from the view of the killer. I felt like I was slogging through something of minimal interest, without any payoff in the end.I sincerely hope Ms George returns to her normal formula after this one, because up until now I have always enjoyed her books."
1,Overwritten prelude to nothing,"I've never submitted my opinion on a book before - but this book was so maddening - i felt i had to.What a terrible read! The book just goes on and on and on for hundreds of pages with no end or movement in sight. The frustration is that it captures just enough interest to keep you reading, waiting and hoping for the real story to unravel. 700 pages later - no satisfaction. Additionally, the story ends so abruptly - i thought i may have been missing pages in my copy! The entire plot was over-sterotyped and unrealistic. The characterers - a (murdering) poet, a (drug-dealing) philosopher, and a (gang-raping) pianist - all disguised as common ghetto trash (so much hidden genius in the slums - who knew?) were absolutely ridiculous!i'm actually quite offended that i spent a week reading this drivel.i won't be reading any more of Ms. George's books. these pages are slated to line the catbox."
5,An eye-opener,"After the first five or six Lynley-Havers books, I gave up on George in boredom. About a year ago I picked up this book for fifty cents at an antiques mall, and ithad been gathering dust until four days ago. Thank heavens WCBHSH is not anotherformula book, but, in my mind, a great ""slice of life"". I am still reading,find the book difficult to put down, and regret that this story will have to come to an end. The characters are so real they could walk off the pages; I'd know them anywhere. I find it difficult to understand readers' giving this title only one,two or three stars. ??? I hope that in the next George I pick up I will find the author drops the formulaic writing and follows her true calling."
3,Not the Usual Fare,"An abrupt departure from her usual style and even cast. In ""What Came Before We Shot Her"", Elizabeth George delivers an insightful glance at the underbelly of society we would all rather forget.I'm not sure that is why her reader's enjoy her books however. More likely her usual books are slightly titilating, escapist fare, read mostly by people who know nothing about and have little real contact with the true underclass.While the new book is decent, it will probably enrage a good number of Ms. George's fans who were looking for that undemanding fiction. The new novel finds its mark far too close to reality for most gentle readers.Applause to Ms. George for trying something new and different.Still, here is hoping she will soon return to her regular cast of characters to give me some more of the slightly escapist fare I crave."
3,A sad story,This background story of Inspector Lynley's wife's murder is powerful -and sad. Learning how families manage with almost insurmountable difficulties is gripping. One wonders how those circumstances could be changed - and by whom. But there is also great sadness that Helen has died -- and that Lynley is alone after finally finding happiness with her. We followed Lynley through many cases and regret that we will not have that pleasure again.The reason for the '3'rating is that this is not a pleasant book to read. It challenges the reader to be caring and thoughtful in reactions to the dramatic events that are vividly presented.
4,Brilliant: Listen to it on audio for the best experience,"The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is that the ending was too abrupt, and we're left hanging AGAIN. I didn't want to like this book, but it is haunting me. The audio version is compelling, and you'll get past having to read the patois and slang, when read aloud it flows nicely. I didn't want to have sympathy for these characters, knowing how it will come out, but I did. If you thought this was a Lynley/Havers book, you're an idiot. All you have to do is read the flyleaf or the basic description of the story. This is what happened BEFORE Helen Lynley was shot."
1,Hard to Read - Way different than others,"I have always looked forward to books by Elizabeth George and eagerly purchase every one, but this one was terrible!!! The dialog was hard to read with all of the black English and the plot sucked!!! I plowed through it, hating every moment. She should go back to writing in her normal style. I realize that maybe this is how it is in the slums and that some kids are disadvantaged from birth, but don't really want all the gory details."
1,Elizabeth George disappoints,"After her last novel, where she seemed to be more determined than usual to have every character be miserable and never have the opportunity for any pleasure in life, she has now created a disfunctional family who are doomed for failure from page one. She mixes her love of long words- I could just sense the Thesarus at her side-jarringly with street slang and patois that does not feel real,just distracting. This is a long book, and I found myself skimming many pages . I think judicious editing would have been useful.In short, I am not going to be anxious to read her next book"
1,What came before he shot her,"I am so disappointed in Elizabeth Georges new book. In fact it was so bad that I had to stop reading it not even half way through. Instead of a wonderfully intricate story built around the lives of her characters: Inspector Linley, Barbara Havers etc. we are submitted to a gritty London Urban tale that is not entertaining and very predictable. Also the dialogue is mostly written in heavy dialect that is a strain to read. I read for escape and not to be confronted with the urban plight that I know exists and am sorry for. It seems George has gone the way of Minette Walters and so has probably lost a significant readership."
1,"Disappointing ending, unless a sequel's on the way","[[ASIN:0060545631 What Came Before He Shot Her]When I finished reading this book, I promptly threw it in the recycling bin instead of donating it to the library because I don't want to subject anyone else to reading this. She's a very good writer, that's evident, but I feel as if I wasted so much time reading this 700+ page book to have so many loose ends. Disappointing ending is an understatement. Don't waste your time!"
1,What Came Before He Shot Her,"What a let down when I started reading this book, I had been waiting months for the new Elizabeth George novel with Inspector Lynley and all his sidekicks. What do I get? A lesson in class and race and why the disenfranchised have a reason to kill."
1,Trust the reviews,"Despite the bad reviews, I bought the book on sale because I really like Elizabeth George and thought if I knew going in that it wasn't like her mysteries, I might like it. Wrong! It was long winded, depressing and went no where. You would be better off reading the newspaper about real events which can be depressing enough but at least might inspire you to do something to help in some way, but this book just inspires one to watch TV!"
1,What Came Before He Shot Her,This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. It hard to read; it is depressing and the ending makes you wish you had not wasted the time it took to read it.What Came Before He Shot Her
5,Exquisite Book,"These were the best characters yet from George. The children were wonderful, heartbreaking and doomed. My knowledge that the cliff they were rushing towards involved Lynley's personal world was fraught with anxiety. I could not put it down."
1,What Came Before He Shot Her,Highly recommended reading. So many readers are complaining about not getting the book they wanted from Elizabeth George. I found the sociological comments fascinating as they are very carefully woven into an extremely thoughtful story. Elizabeth George's characters are well drawn as is always the case and the plot moves right along never giving away too much and delivering for the reader. The reader can always depend on the author to be meticulous in her presentation and writing. She is at the top of her game in this novel and further demonstrates her skill as a fine novelist. Taking on issues that compel and force the reader to think. This is a fresh and different approach for the author which I thoroughly enjoyed.
2,the dialect is my problem,"I have given up halfway through this book - something I seldom do. Why? It was not the lack of Lynley and Havers, or the story itself. It was the unrelenting use of dialect. Whether the local speech is rendered accurately or not I cannot say, but it was like reading a 500+ page book written as a text message."
3,Review,This is a look into the life of three children and their aunt who are beset by influences and problems far beyond their means to deal with them. It is also a look into how the system tries to help them to cope. Ultimately it is a story of how the lack of emotional and psychological support lead to the dissolution of family.
3,Listen to it on CD,"I tried to read this and it was awful, BUT when I listened to the audio book it was very good. The dialect is much better listened to than read. It allows you to remember than London isn't all Big Ben and glamor. For many it's a hell-hole."
1,save your money,"I hated this book with a passion. i love books in general and Elizabeth George is one of my favorite authors, but i hated this one so much that i was tempted to actually burn it. i decided i won't be buying any more of her books, but i have relented enough to at least give one more book oh hers a try by getting it from the library.WHY did i hate it so much? mainly for the nonexistent ending; the rest i seem to have blocked out. :-p"
1,Boring Downer,"Depressing setting, characters and world view. Tawdry sex, drugs and teenage girls playing hooky. I threw the book in the garbage after 136 pages. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,The worst I ever read,Please don't think this is a Lynley novel. It is a disgusting unremitting social services failure. It should not be. It just is a horrible novel. Why are we buying this junk? This author should be reprimanded about this making us think that it is a Lynley book?
2,Disappointing,"I like Elizabeth George's writing, and can understand her wanting to write about something other than Lynley and Havers, but this book was disappointing. The book doesn't feel closed and I don't know if it's part 1 of the sequel or just leaving us hanging. I also didn't care for the London street talk. I spent way too much time trying to figure out if ""innut"" meant ""isn't it""; ""idiot"" or what. And in the end, I just didn't care."
2,"Dickens, she's not.","A more depressing tale of poverty, degradation, the corruption of children by gangs I've never heard. The argot in which most of the dialog is written renders it almost unreadable. There is no redemption of any of the characters, which renders it hopeless."
1,Tiresome pop sociology,"I am a big fan of Elizabeth George, but intensely disliked this book. No amount of sociological mumbo-jumbo can justify murder. Although George falls short of suggesting outright that social marginalization can explain what happened at the end of her last book, she comes suspiciously close. And frankly, I don't buy the fact that many of the characters' criminal actions are simply and inevitably consequences of their social circumstances.The prose is also tiresome to read. I don't ever again want to see the ""word"" ""innit"". If it was possible to rate this book less than 1 star, I would have done so."
2,Not her best work,"I recently discovered that the Inspector Lynley series that I loved on PBS was actually a book series first so I have being reading the series almost nonstop for the past 3 months. I could not finish this book, in fact, I stopped before page 200, and then skipped to the very back of the book. While Ms. George's books have been heading in this direction for the past several, this one delivers a preachy, social commentary on London that leads the reader to believe that the city is peopled by poor, uneducated immigrants who have taken over it over and are dealing drugs and peddling sex on every street corner and/or are deviants and perverts. I love a good murder mystery with plot twists and thought provoking writing. This was just a depressing slog through a sewer. I would recommend giving all but the last chapter a miss."
2,tragic,"I tend to agree with the other reviews here that found the book disappointing. The writing is very good. The author really gets into the mind of the characters. However, I did not have any good feelings for any of the characters. They either pissed me off or I did not like them. Continually left me with negative feelings throughout the book and at times did not want to finish the story. I would not read anything else this author writes or has written."
2,What Came Before He Shot Her.,"I wish I had read some of the reviews, before I purchased the book.I am struggling through it, but I'm determined to read it out.I have been a long time fan of E.G.. and will continue to be.I just feel she has gone off on a tangent, perhaps to prove her deeper writing skills.This book has been well researched, and well written, but the ghetto dialect wore me out.One would guess writers grow bored with there characters after a time, and need to have a change of pace.It just short changes the reader, when they think that the beloved Lynely will be included in this new book ..PS. Glad Helen is dead, and will not be missed, in the next Lynely book?D.I. Spaulding"
1,What was she thinking??,"I have read every other mystery Elizabeth George has written and enjoyed them all immensely but I have to say I couldn't finish this one. I can only liken it to Dickens who drops the reader down only to lift her up again. Except there was no lift to this one. It just plunged me deeper and deeper into a kind of literary despair. If I had finished this book, I might have done myself in. Two thumbs down. I think a writer the caliber of Elizabeth George could have done better than this. I can't help but wonder if she's going through some dark period in her life that's manifesting itself in her writing."
4,What Came Before He Shot Her,"This horribly depressing book reads more like a Ruth Rendell than an Elizabeth George as the reader is drawn deeper and deeper into the warped world view of unwilling juvenile delinquent Joel Campell and his abysmally dysfuntional family. Don't expect to see your favorite New Scotland Yard characters of Lynley, Havers, or Nkata, except for the latter two in a cameo appearance.The writing is descriptive and evocative, as always, but this book will not make you feel good."
1,What Came After She Wrote Well,"Elizabeth George has earned herself a well-deserved fortune writing about the English upper classes. She should've stuck to it. In this book she tries to do the same for London's lower classes, and she's hopelessly out of her element. Just trying to get through a page with her version of the slang blacks use there was enough to twist my eyebrows. Formerly one of her biggest fans, I forced myself to make it through to the end, and took it to my used book store for credit (it didn't deserve an honored place with the rest of her books, to be read over and over, on my bookshelf)."
5,A great departure,"Tremendous writing in terms of character development, themes and sense of place. A brave and welcome departure from the mystery genre. Great social and psychological drama. She's not dumbing down her writing as some authors are, and her work keeps getting better. She's fascinating to hear talk about her writing process at book signings.Paul"
3,Shades Of Gray,"It seems that everyone either loved or hated this book. I think, however, that the truth is in the middle. I think, as usual, George's characterizations and plotting were superb. If one couldn't at least feel some empathy with the Campbell family then I think there's something wrong. However, the problem is that no amount of social circumstance/justification can possibly make up for the betrayal of George's readers committed at the end of the prior book. In fact, one can almost see the wheels turning in George's mind when writing this -- I'll put all my effort into supreme pathos to try to deflect attention from my prior butchery of my own characters, and maybe they'll forgive me. Well, guess what, I don't really think they will. I suspect, like me, people will keep reading George's works, but never with the same delight ""that came before he shot her""."
1,From Bad to Worse,"Even though I have never written a review, reading this book has compelled me to do so. Having never read a George novel, but having read excellent reviews of her previous work, I was really looking forward to this book. After reading this one, I will probably never read her again. In the first chapter, I found the characters unbelievable and throughout the book they became less believable. How can every character in the book can never make a rational decision in any situation is beyond me. Her writing takes so long to get to the point that is goes beyond boring. I kept reading the book feeling that it would eventually get better. Boy was I wrong..."
1,What a disappointment...,"I certainly can't speak for all readers of English murder mysteries, but I know that I read them for pure escape. One can usually count on things coming out right in the end. I have enjoyed several of Ms George's previous Inspector Lynley books and was looking forward to this one. I was horribly disappointed.It is rare for me to start a book and not finish it - seems sort of ones moral duty to give the author the full book in which to tell her story; I'm on page 109 and will return it to the library tomorrow.I don't read English murder mystery books in order to know more about the mixed race underclass in London, nor do I enjoy dialect. I can't imagine what on earth the author was thinking - she certainly has disappointed her loyal readership with this book."
1,Totally Disappointed,I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I began to read this book. I never read the covers for Elizabeth George's books. I always just order them because I a am such a fan. I continue to read because I love the continuing characters. I was shocked and crushed when Lyndley's wife was killed in the previous book and could not wait for the next installment. This is where the problem is. I could care less about the life of the boy who shot her. I know this is probably a socialy revelent book but that is NOT why I read Elizabeth George. If I could return the book I would and I just hope I can save other fans from making the same mistake.
2,"Too long, too predictable, too hard to take","I (like another reviewer) read about 100 pages and then skimmed to get to the end. I wanted a mystery -this was a treatsie on social ills and flawed human beings. Including these issues in a book with an interesting plot could be very effective. In this book I felt suffocated by the myriad of misfortunes -drug abuse, mental illness, developmental delay, poverty, child neglect, criminal behavior, rape, sexual misconduct (to put it mildly). Certainly not enjoyable --but also not illuminating. Just way too much -would have required an author with far more insight into these topics to pull it off."
2,"A ""black and white"" vision","Although this is a well-written book and very suspenseful, I found it offensive in that all the ""dark-skinned"" characters are problematic -- narcissistic, violent, incompetent, out of touch with reality, just plain crazy, etc, (with the exception of the Pakistani clan) while all the ""white"" characters were understanding, idealistic, highly educated, forgiving, competent, serious, dedicated... Would definitely have preferred a more balanced mix there. If I were a dark-skinned person, I would certainly not appreciate this lop-sided view of reality, even of the slums in London.However, I'm delighted to be delivered from Helen. I suspect George was also getting bored with her. It's still a mystery why she bothered creating her at all... Certainly gives me less respect for LYnley to see him hanging out with these dull women...Oh well, no one's perfect. The love interest in detective novels is often pretty much not the point... and it shows!"
2,Latest installment disappointing,"I love Elizabeth George and always look forward to her next book; however ""What Came Before He Shot Her"" was a great disappointment. Interest story line and glimpses of life in the stums of London, but the combination of lower class British usage/gang slang/black dialogue made the book hard to read. But, the ending did answer the who and why questions of the on-going Inspector Lynly series."
1,A Heartbreaking Disappointment,"Elizabeth George, please come back. This book examines in sickening detail the events preceding the murder of our lovely Helen. I, for one, don't care. I get it. We all got it the last time. It's been a long time since I have abandoned any book after a few chapters, and this book truly deserves to be put down in every sense. Don't buy it!"
1,A disappointment,"This novel is largely a 550-page justification for the murder with which George ended With No One As Witness. The family at the center of the story is disadvantaged in every conceivable way, and as the story progresses they just can't seem to catch a break. However, they are also guilty of nearly unjustifiable acts of violence and self-destruction at times (especially the daughter) so my sympathy is tempered.George is much given to didactic asides which attempt to explain her characters' motivations in sociological terms, which quickly becomes tiresome. Over 500 pages of a treatise on the social ills of London's underclass really starts to drag after a while. Ultimately I found I just didn't care very much about the Campbell family, certainly not as much as I care about Helen Lynley and her unborn child, the innocent victims.Here's hoping George sees the light and gets back to Lynley and Havers in her next novel."
4,Sings Gospel from her heart and soul!,"I was not familiar with Cissy Houston (Whitney Houston's mother)until after Whitney's death and I read about her background. So, I ordered this CD and really like it remembering that Cissy Houston was a background singer and a choir director early in her career. I especially like her version of one of my favorite songs Amazing Grace. I am very happy with my purchase and if you are a fan of either Cissy or Whitney Houston (or like me and never heard Cissy Houston sing), you should add this CD to your Gospel collection."
4,A UK Tribute Band's effort,"While this is not as faithful a musical imitation as the West End London stage showBlues BrothersI must give some credit where credit is due, these guys try *hard*, and they dust off a few of the rarer Blues Brothers songs along with some of the favorites, so they're informed, the back up band is OK, but Jake & Elwood's British accents slip through in a couple of places, ""Elwood"" is not as strong a bass singer as Dan Ackroyd, and ""Jake"" sounds like he could be good, but recorded this after a few months on the road-- his throat is shot. Nice arrangements, they pull numbers from each of the movies and from Saturday Night Live performances, but lacking a bit of spark in the studio; I bet these guys can really play off a receptive audience, but not so much here. There's a bit of fun to be found in it, but moreso in the genuine article."
2,Can't be a Mack without the Godfather,"American Pimp is a great documentary. I'd like to see an updated one.I too thought the music was straight off the street.But to leave off ""The Godfather of Soul"" James Brown's ""The Boss"" was ""square""."
3,A detailed legal analysis,"This book focuses almost entirely on the legal aspects and status of privacy. It appears to be do a good job of that but I can't tell. I didn't find much about technology, political issues or potential future developments"
5,A great fable for everyone,I had walked past this book and was reccomended to me at least a million times. Until one day i opened the cover into the mysterious world with Amy. And cute and lovely story that keeps you going till the last page. It was uncompairable. I really reccomend this to anyone who will give amy and her story a chance.
5,AWESOME!!!,"I purchased this as a straight recreational ""fun boat""...what I received was a very stable, comfortable, and straight tracking kayak!!Don't let the ""inflatable"" in the name scare you away...this is a truly awesome kayak, that I am proud to paddle!!Folks in their ""tupperware"" kayaks are always asking me where I got this boat.the only downside I have found is that when your are paddling hard, the inevitable paddle drip will eventually seep through the nylon top deck...nothing a little ScotchGuard, and the included spray skirt won't fix .Do yourself a favor.....BUY IT!!!"
3,It floats,"Good beginner kayak..Works well in lakes and ponds... Not meant for anyone over 5'10 or 200 lbs...A friend and I rode down the upper Allegheny river and kept bottoming out in shallow water. This kayak is essentially a raft. The part of the raft under your butt constantly hits the bottom in shallow water and bows in the middle.The spray skirt it useless since the nylon top is NOT WATERPROOF... This is a summer kayak only and you will get wet. I would never take this boat in cold water..The kayak does not propel through the water as quickly as a fiberglass o r plastic one does... You have to paddle twice as hard as others who are in non inflatable boats..Also, I had the same problem as others when trying to get a wet boat back into the bag.This kayak is much cheaper than the plastic and fiberglass ones in the stores... You pay for what you get...For beginners and children this is a good kayak.. For adults and those who want to stay dry keep looking..."
4,my friend loves it,"I bought this as a gift for my friend, who was thrilled. She absolutely loves it. She was using it smoothly right away without any practice, and she covers plenty of flat distance with little effort and no control trouble.On the other hand, when she suggested I give it a try myself, I couldn't really get in and out -- she's small, I'm big (and not limber), and this is more a smaller person's boat.She does get kinda wet riding this. She doesn't care -- never uses the spray skirt."
1,Only good for a swimming pool!,"Based on the reviews I read, I had high expectations. But I was thoroughly disappointed by the quality of the kayak. 3 leaks in three outings!! All without any punctures from the outside. The quality of the inner tubes is very poor. All leaks were right at the seams, and very close together. I attributed the first one to overinflation. But that was definetely not the case for the next 2. And since they're all within a few inches of each other, I have to attribute the leaks to poor quality. The kayak is also not for people with average or above average size feet. They don't fit inside.This kayak is too unreliable to use outside of a swimming pool! Not even deserving the one star I had to give it.I also have an Advancedframe Kayak, which is wonderful, and absolutely trouble free. That I would give 5 stars!"
3,"good book, heavy on service aspects","Overall this is a very good book, i was required to get this for one for one of my classes. it does a very good job at explaining things. the only downfall is that sometimes the book does not focus very heavily on theory aspects of transmissions."
4,"Review for ""Hong Kong trees: Omnibus volume""","The quality of the book is good. No marking, like new. But the edge of the book starts to ""detach"" but it is totally acceptable for me because of the old age (20 years) of the book. I am happy with the purchase. Thanks."
1,Cheap design,"Would never recommend: With in a few months the knob broke then after only a year, the fan stopped working. I wanted to know why so I took it apart. The thermal fuse, a nonrestable type, had blow. Checking further, the motor's sealed bearings were seizing causing the fan to draw high current. POS, I'll find a better company for my next fan."
2,Doesn't last,"This fan worked great, while it lasted. It put out a very nice breeze, was relatively quiet, liked it a lot. Then, after 2.5 years, it broke, fan just rotates very slowly. Warranty is 2 years? Nice timing. They have a replacement policy, for $50, they'll send a new one. Big deal."
2,Gave Out Within a Year,"I bought one of these to use in two ways: both on the floor and in a small kitchen window (sitting on the window sill).Within a year, the air output had diminished noticeably, although the motor sounded the same.I suspect the fan blades were slipping, but for the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to open the case to get inside and fix the problem.So I threw this junk out and got the larger Vornado ""flat"" fan, which sits on the window sill and works like a champ.I think you're much better off buying one of the Vornados (flat or tubular)than this noisy thing..."
2,I bought mine 6/23/11 and today 7/10/11 the motor is blowing out oil.,"Not a happy camper. I purchased my fan on 6/23/11 and today, 7/10/11, it's blowing oil out from the motor. That is 17 days. I had to clean up my cream carpet and the fan is going back. I don't want a replacement, I want my $79.49 back. Also, the instructions say to only use 117 volts 60 HZ A.C. outlet. Well, this is the USA and that is not my wiring. This fan was made in CANADA for their standards, not ours. The documentation does not say UL, Underwriters' Laboratory approved, either. What the Hell!!"
2,beware,"fan is not that quiet although it moves good amount of air. My vornado is quieter, and on any speed but low, it sounds like jet engine.You get an offer to purchase pedestal in box for 25 dollars, but it is a worthless and flimsy piece of plastic that will break under the slightest bump."
2,Cheap toy,My son begged me to buy this toy. He played with it one time and it ended up with the rest of the uninteresting airplanes.. helicopters and other toys that are suppose to take flight! Needless to say.. waste of money.
4,Kids like em,"Grand kids enjoyed this supplement to their holiday gifts. Would purchase again. As a matter of fact, I have bought them before."
5,My 3 year old can play with this for an hour,Bought this for my just three year old daughter. She LOVES it. She can play with it for an hour. I will buy this as a gift in the future.
3,Stomp Rocket,A number of years ago I bought this toy for my older sons and it was much bigger. I was kind of disappointed when I saw how wimpy the supports were.
3,Very fun.,"I purchased 3. One for my son, nephew and a birthday present for a classmate. The rocket is a big hit!! When I gave it to my nephew the kids gathered around it and all took their turns. They played with it for well over an hour. With all the fighting over who could get it to go higher/further it took a pretty good beating. The rockets couldn't handle it and two cracked on the first day. I am sure it wouldn't have happened if it were one or two kids. I give it three stars because the rockets could be made to be more durable."
4,Entertainment for kids and adults,"This is a very simple toy. You stomp on it and the rocket flies in the air. The fun part is when older kids and adults have a lot of power in their stomp, the rockets REALLY go high! It's amazing how such a simple toy will draw a lot of attention. We live in a cul-de-sac and the entire street crowds around when we're playing with it.Regarding durability - it's an inexpensive toy with some inexpensive parts. But the only parts we've had issues with are the rockets. The ""wings"" on them can break off if the kids aren't playing with them properly. With that said, if the toy is used properly, it'll last for a long time."
3,Fun while it lasted,"This WAS a great toy, until it broke the same day the children received it. The rockets fly high, and the children all loved it. 4 hours after we opened the box, one of the ""stand"" legs broke off, so then someone had to hold the launcher. A couple hours later the plastic on two of the rockets cracked when one of the children squeezed it too hard, so the rocket wouldn't launch anymore.I finally threw the remaining rocket away today.This is a great idea, but this is definitely a ""throw away"" toy. It won't last more than a week, IF you are lucky."
3,it a fun toy,"If you going to buy this toy I recommend buy extra rocket, because the fin and the rocket itself will torn in few used especially on hard surface like driveway."
4,Outdoor play,"I bought this toy for my 7 yr old son, who loves books and tv more than playing outside, he isnt heavy but needed the exercise, we headed to the park where a few kids joined in, taking turns jumping on the pump and running to pick up the rocket, they played all afternoon. Great toy"
4,Impresses their friends,we have one older version and two of the current ones. They were gifts. We all love them! Perfect for little ones all the way up to adults. Great toy to pull out at picnics. My 10 and 8 yr old boys used them at cub scout day camp for the rocket theme. Big hit with all the boys! They go up high and come down nice. Doesn't hurt it you get bonked when they come down.
5,Excellent purchase,"My kid just loves this toy. It is great for indoor as well as outdoor use. Since the rocket is made of foam, it does rise upwards and makes a compelling toy"
3,Cheap,"This rocket was fun at first. But after a couple stomps, the stomp pump start getting loose. Also, the fins on the rockets fall off easily and the tube cracks. When these happen, the rocket will no longer fun. Good while it lasted, though."
5,instant fun,"My kids got 2 of these - it took the little guys (ages 6 and 9) about 1 minute to set up the bases, and then it was stomp fun. The rockets stand up to a fair amount of abuse (being stepped on, etc) - they are made of durable, rigid plastic. Three little fins at the back of each rocket lead to better flying. The adjustable tube means you can point this where you want it.It's fun to take these out as a family - Daddy likes to send the rockets flying and let the little ones run to retrieve them. You need a pretty big space - we go to the nearby park. An adult can get the rocket to go really far - even the kids can send the rockets 100 feet away.I recommend this for its durability, its fun-ness, and how easy it is to set up and put away. This toy is a winner.(we paid about $15 each for two boxes, and bought a couple of sets of extra rockets at about $5 each.)"
4,Great Fun!,I was looking for some fun outdoor toys for my 5 year-old daughter that we could enjoy together. This fits the bill. It has been a lot of fun. I also have used it to teach her about taking turns so that I can make sure I get a chance to stomp. My one year-old boy also likes even though he can't make take off on his own--we just jump on it together.I would give it five stars but the stand keeps coming apart so it is a little annoying. Otherwise great toy.
4,Great Gift Idea,"I have given these rockets as gifts for seeral years. Each time, it turns out to be the ""hit"" of the party. Even the adults like to play with these neat rockets. I do suggest that large adults be careful when launching the rockets."
4,fully functional,"Didn't know if this thing would really work, but it's well-designed and seems quite durable. Makes for an instant contest to see which kid can shoot it the highest. Very easy to use, and it gets fun in a hurry!"
5,Great fun for kids,I ordered this for my 6-year-old son. He and my older daughters all love to play with it. It is great fun!
5,A Great Gift!,We purchased this for my son's 6th birthday and it was and continues to be a real hit. He has a blast playing with this toy. It is nice to get away from all the electronic gadgets. This is fun for the whole family.
4,Fun toy,"My 4 year old loves this toy. I don't know how long it's going to last, but so far so good. The rockets fly pretty good and are pretty durable"
3,Rockets are plastic,"It shoots well and easy. The rockets are plastic and have cracked already. We can still shoot them, but I don't know for how long."
3,Not as popular as expected,"I thought my kids would love these so i bought these for all 3 kids with extra rockets. But, the kids have never really played with them. I think it' cool to stomp on the foam rocket and watch it fly. Fly it does! I can make it soar but, the toy is not for me. I finally gave them to a local charity. I hope some kid somewhere will like them."
3,Super fun...but...,"This toy was not only fun for my 5 year old but the whole family got into it. The only issue is that the flights on the rockets are thin plastic which starts to break after multiple impacts. It seems strange that they would be so cheaply made considering the quality of the rest of the rocket, but they are.Still tons of fun but don't expect it to last forever."
1,No Box beware and it was a gift,"I am soooo pissed. I ordered this as a present and it came all in pieces in a plastic bag. No box like described. No instructions. This company I will NEVER order from again. And I was planning for this to be my go to gift for all my son's friends. Not anymore. My son even told the little boy what his gift was going to be. Now I can't gift it to him and have to get myself up and out with the flu to get another gift. Mom to 4 kids under age 5. This was supposed to be a convenience. Like I have time now to return this mess of a present to UPS. But I will be...How dare this company really send out something like this?!! If I gave this for a gift, it would look like I perused my kids' play room, grabbed a bunch of used stuff and threw it in a bag. Bad business."
4,fun toy,"Bought this for a Christmas gift for my 9 year old granddaughter but the whole family loved playing with it. Use it in an area where the rocket has plenty of room to land, like a field away from trees. It operates on foot power and is really fun."
4,Stomp rocket ultra - Fun toy,"I got this for my son's 6th birthday. He loves it, and it's fun for the whole family. It does exactly what it says... you stomp on it, the rocket flies up high, and comes back down. It's easy to put together. My only complaint, is that the tripod comes apart often, but it easily goes back together. Overall, great product for the money :)"
4,Great Toy Rocket!,"My 4 year old son loves this toy. It's easy for him to do everything by himself. When he jumps on the pump the rockets goes about 20' in the air. I can make it go about 40'...no where near the advertised 200'. But for our smaller sized yard, 40' is just about too much, so it works great for us. It really is suprising how far this rocket will go based on what it looks like. Also it is very safe, the padding on the rockets softens the blow, even from ""point blank"" range. This was one of the first things I tested before letting my son play with it by himself. One of the rockets stopped working fairly soon; it may have been stepped on and then no longer properly fit on the ""launch pipe"". There are still 3 working rockets and you can buy additional rockets, so I would consider this a very minor problem. Great Toy!"
4,Kids love it,"Not much to say other than this toy is a lot of fun, the kids really enjoy using it, and it holds up to a lot of use."
5,keep it outdoors!,"every kid will enjoy soaring these rockets into the air. sturdy, and works great. Rockets shoot really high! Keep it away form the house so the rockets don't get stuck on the roof."
3,Fun but not totally durable,"My two boys, ages 7 & 4, absolutely love playing with this toy!! The only thing I wasn't crazy about and would recommend if you do purchase this is to buy extra rockets because after some use the rockets can crack and then they don't blast off because of splits in the plastic. Also the tripod that the rocket launcher is made of doesn't want to stay together so I found myself constantly putting it back together for my boys. Maybe if it we hot-glued it that problem would be fixed."
3,"Simple, but fun for outside","Not much too this, so make sure you don't pay much for it...but its fun for a little outside game."
5,the name says it all.,There's nothing funner than stomping on a device that propels a rocket up into the air. It's soft so won't break anything which is a big plus. The only downside is the wings come off easy but they can reattach.
4,Cheap Fun!,My 4 year old son loves this and although he wouldn't admit it so does my 14 year old :o) It is a cheap toy but so far it's held up remarkably well. My only con is that the darn things keep getting stuck high in our tree. We've lost 2 already so be warry if you have a small backyard...these suckers can go really high and can be carried by the wind! Refills are easily found though.
4,Lots of fun for the money,"This simple, durable, toy is just plain fun. Super easy to use. Surprising height from a foot stomp. The rockets don't get caught in tree branches. Well made. Yes, you can hand hold and aim the rockets (just not at anyone)."
1,It didn't last more than an hour!!!,The quality of this product was very poor. My 3 years old son could just play with it for an hour and the holder broke down.
2,Too hard for little kids,"We had another rocket launch toy that my son (5 and a half) loved but was just about worn out. We got this as a replacement, but it is VERY hard for even me as an adult to get good height because the ""pillow"" you stomp on is very large."
3,One of the rockets broke on the first launch,Great toy. Sad that one of the rockets broke on the first launch - the foam on the top just bursted. To send it back for replacement would actually be more expensive than to buy another one. Bummer.
4,Nice,Worth the fun....Dont even look at the Junior.... This can be fun for the kids and parents.... get the toy!
4,stomping,Great fun and no batteries required. The hose is a little flimsy but other than that it's a terrific toy for stomping!
4,"Fun toy for my 6,7 year old nephews","They love showing this off to their friends but besides the initial excitement this toy has little to offer. It is fairly durable, contains multiple rockets (incase any should get lost like ours did). Recommended."
3,Boys love rockets!,"My 2 young grandsons loved playing with this toy. However, it does not fly as high as advertised and does take a bit of a stomping to get it up high enough for them to be impressed."
4,Great toy for kids,"I saw a family play this stomp Rocket, my kids want the same, went and ask where they bought it, so I did order and when it get delivered to us, straight away we open and we have lots of fun play it, thanks!"
4,"Biggest hit on the street, could be more durable","We were honestly shocked by how cool this toy turned out to be. Very easy to setup, the rockets launch a good 50-60 feet into the air at least on a good stomp and the launcher and the pad are built well enough. It's garnered LOTS of attention from the neighborhood kids who are all asking where we got such a thing.Our only complaint would be the durability, or lack thereof, of the rockets themselves. If they land hard or on the wrong spot, the red tails will split. This doesn't completely ruin the rocket nor the experience, but some didn't make it through two launches even. That said, we ordered the launcher kit and replacement rockets and will be buying more. We're very glad we purchased it, the boys love it as do the neighbor kids and we'd of course purchase it all over again, easily.Fun toy!"
5,Kids love it,"We got 3 of these for our triplets' 4th birthday. The 4 year-olds, 5 year-old, and 10 year-old all had a total blast launching these over and over."
4,Fun toy,"This toy is one that brought all of the neighborhood kids over, and even my husband has enjoyed it. Fortunately we live in a not busy cul-de-sac, because the rockets would be on the roof!"
5,I Wish All Toys Were This Cool,"I bought this for my two-and-a-half year old son to use at a vacation house this summer. Based on the previous reviews, I didn't see any reason to go with the ""junior"" version, even though his age would suggest otherwise. I am so glad I made this purchase.We took turns stomping the rocket - although he couldn't get them to go as high as I could, he still really got a kick out of stomping the rocket. I had to beg to take my turn! The rocket goes really high! Cheap thrills, for sure, but this is a legitimate educational tool as well (once he gets older).We used it all weekend long, and again several times at home outside before the weather got cold. I am certain we'll bring it out again in the spring. This seems as durable as you could reasonably expect, and I won't hesitate to replace it if it breaks. Great for kids of all ages, I would say."
1,Missing Pages,"I have not read all of the essays in this book yet, but the lead essay ""Mysticism and Logic"" has pages missing. There is a gap of probably two pages between the bottom of the first page in print, and the next page in print, which is numbered ""4."" Then pages 6 and 7 are missing. The rest of this essay appears to be present.This book is printed from a scan of the copy in the Cornell University Library. I found an online copy of this book on Internet Archive, and it is missing the same pages in this essay. So the problem may be in the scan of the original in the Cornell library. Internet Archive has two other scans from different sources that appear to be complete."
5,great for us bakers,"very durable and great for baking, especially large batches. Just what a serious cook/chel needs."
3,Still quite stiff,"Sometime along the way of Rubbermaid product production, they stiffened the scraper, and they don't clean out bowls or jars as well as the old ones. ( I was a Rubbermaid Party Plan manager till the company closed that business.) I am still trying various scrapers, spatulas, with very little success."
4,scraper,Nice to have it in one piece. Easier to keep clean. Hard to find rubbermaid scrapers and I think they are the best brand.
5,Great kitchen tool,"I bought these spatulas after realizing that I could not by Rubbermaid spatulas any more. They are working very well and are not overly stiff. You can easily scrape the sides of any bowl. They are as good as the Rubbermaid, maybe even better because the wooden handles can hold bactieria."
2,I returned these,"They were made in China. Sadly you cannot find out until you order them, which I did. I will not make the mistake of purchasing additional Rubbermaid products. Their web site says they have factories in the US, but they don't use them to make Spatulas, and I don't want to pay for more return shipping."
3,disappointed,I am disappointed tht the handle is so short. I would not recommend it nor would I purchase another that is so short.
1,Beware of Amazon vendors & shipping!,"The Rubbermaid spatula is great! BUT I sent it back, because this item was sold by a vendor for Amazon, not Amazon itself. And the vendor charged over $8.00 shipping (on an item costing $2.65). That's just a little out of proportion, don't you think? P.S. I only got 1/2 of the shipping back."
1,Not the one you want,Ordered the 16.5 inch version of the product. It is a bit too long - I know now why that length was cheaper than the shorter versions. Still - it was not the length that has turned me against this product it is the poor quality of the rubber spatula head. Using it to turn some vegetables in a frying pan it quickly began to melt and disintegrate into the food. I would certainly not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Way Way toooo big,"didnt expect an extra large size thought it would be a normal size spatula hard to handle did not like. To make use of this size I would have to be making a triple batch of cookies, cakes etc...will not make that mistake again."
4,Moonshine and Martinis,"Never thought this pairing could bring it off. I was pleasently amazed! A true example of people having fun, making music and all of the listeners benefit. It's a shame that more fans of both aren't aware of this album. I chased it down from a car comercial! Shame on Columbia!"
3,Interesting...,"As others have pointed out, Jimmy Rushing and the Dave Brubeck Quartet don't initially seem like natural partners. Apparently Brubeck himself felt that same way prior to recording this album! But in spite of that, it works pretty well. The differing styles do jar occasionally it has to be said and more often they simply don't quite work. That said, some of it works well (""Evenin'"" especially is worth a look) and at times Rushing and Desmond really seem to click.It's clear that the band had a lot of fun on this album. They didn't QUITE make magic though. Worth a look if you are a fan of either the Brubeck Quartet or of Rushing but I wouldn't say it could be classed as an essential addition to a collection of either's works. Both did better work than this during their careers. That said, they set high standards to live up to. It's never anything other than pleasant to listen to, but it doesn't set the world on fire either."
3,Just OK Is All I Can Contribute,Perhaps I was distracted by the quality of some of the recordings. I remember a powerful voiced Cissy Houston. This CD does not necessarily exhibit this except in Prayer Will Change Things.
4,This CD has a variety of styles for all listeners.,"The CD is inspirational. I especially like He Changed My Life; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost Is He; Prayer Will Change It and Shelter In the Time of Storm. Based on today's world, Prayer Will Change It sends a strong message to everyone to change the world. Shelter in the Time of Storm also has a good message for anyone who is feeling down in the dumps. The clincher, however, is He Changed My Life. It sums up every song on the CD, and, incidentally, it is the last track on the CD. Great job, Cissy Houston. Sure would like to hear some more from you."
4,Fun Whistle,you can't blow in both ends of this and the end you can is good I have played with cat's with it so far have not got to field test it but cat's think it's a hurt animal so I'm hoping it does it job
3,"""Now I Know:","I have asked many people and read diferent versions of just how the pyrqmids were build. This seems to be the most plausable one and one I can relate to. Having climbed around on them and wondered just how many hands had been involved, I now have some answers to my questions."
3,Trump shoe order,"I love these shoes originally from Demonia and sold by Wilde Syde which must have sold the business. I received these from ""unknown"" and the boxes were broken and smelled like they sat in a warehouse or storage place. I assume that ""unknown"" bought the products and are reselling them on Amazon. I could tell they were returned shoes that were sanded, then sprayed inside with a shoe sanitizer and polished with heavy wax polish. The leather did not have the grain detail and there was no shine to the shoes. I was quite disappointed, but because I have small wide feet and bought all my pants a longer length because I like the heel of the shoe and style, I chose to keep them. I know I will not be ordering these again."
1,Service Excellent - Product not so good,"The service for receiving the product was outstanding! However, the product itself was not great. I ordered a size 11, but the shoe was too wide and too short in length. I had to return it. I will order from this company again due to the excellent service and how the return was handled. Great Job!"
2,From a students perspective...,"I am a Computer Science student at Virginia Tech and Cliff Shaffer taught my Data Structures class. This book was used in the class, and many of my fellow students would agree, this book is awkward in every sense of the word. Not only is the material poorly written and confusing, the code examples didnt help much either. I found myself constantly reading and re-reading sections that were needed for programming assignments and going huh? If you have a strong desire to learn data structures, keep looking for your data structures book, this one isnt it..."
1,Poor Coding Examples,"I have been using this book for a college course and have found other texts that are much more clear. I am disappointed with the authors examples of Java code due partly because of his breaking conventions in naming and compact style. The author repeatedly uses unconventional names for his classes which results in hard to follow implementations. The author also uses his own custom classes (which is not necessary for study) in his examples. The author has decent explanations of various notations such as Big-O, Big-Omega, and Bit-Theta. However, I would not recommend this book for any introductory course in data structures and algorithm analysis."
3,Good coverage but too hard to follow,"Lots of examples and thorough coverage give this book a shot at being a valuabe book. However, Shaffer's coding style is difficult to read and often bogged down in overly object oriented complexity. Furthermore, unintuitive explanations of concepts make the non-coded aspects of the book frustrating to read. Taking the books price (currently $63.00 new) into consideration, I'd pass this one up."
1,Poor written book,This book is definitely not for a student to read. A lot of sentences are very difficult to understand. I have to read a few times to try to understand. Also this book lack of examples. I don't understand why we have to choose to use this book as a textbook.
2,The gears on the cover dont even work!,I have Dr Shaffer as my professor and he is just as boring in real life as his book. He has told us that some of the code segements are broken to make his students figure them out. DONT buy this book... It's not worth the money.
2,Bad Book,"I was required to get this book for my CS344 class and so far I don't like this book at all. The exercises at the end of each chapter aren't good problems. Don't get it unless, like me, you have to."
5,Excellent Book,"Fantastic book. Easier to dissect than the ""bible"" by Corman, Rivest, and Leiserson, but still thorough and well-written. The pseudocode is written in C++, which makes it indispensible to both students of the language and C++ professionals. Never leaves my side."
1,A helpless book,"Frankly, I was extremely disappointed with this book. I originally bought it for a Data Structures class and soon found that it was never of any use. The book is extremely hard to follow and, at times, fails to include enough information. Such as Big-O notation. I count a total of 5 pages that show no useful examples but constantly talk about Big-Oh (notice the ""h"") while providing no solutions to finding the bounds."
2,Very unhelpful book,"Dr. Shaffer attempts to address the difficult topic of data structures and fails. Consistently he glosses over important points, or does not describe the implementation of data structures (the buffer pool, for example, is especially poor) adequately and leaves the hapless student confused and frustrated. For a computer scientist who already understands the subject this book may contain a few good points. Indeed, I was able to follow the sections where I had previous training, but when I studied material new to me, I was out of luck.If you are unlucky enough to have a university that uses this text, consider trying to find a better book to get yourself an adequate understanding of this important subject, because Dr. Shaffer's text won't do that for you."
1,The worst data structure book i've ever read,"As a textbook, this book is a total failure. I would avoid it at all cost."
1,Video never worked :(,"I got this video and it did not work. The company said that they would not send another but eventually sent another copy. The next copy did not work either. I felt very ripped off. It had nothing to do with my DVD player, everyother video I own works."
2,Mastercam Lite,I've used the training manuals that came with the software andI am still trying to figure out what this book is offering for the price. I could not find a clear explaination on how to evenlay down a line or even edit geometry and toolpaths when routinedesign changes occur. I felt very limited reading this text.I found errors in the text. The kind of key productivity methods used by real mastercam operators using the software are missing. If I were having a meal this book would be a lite snack.
1,Too simplistic for the money,"I bought this book and was very disappointed with what it hadto offer. The authors play the game of making the reader thinkthe software is easy by treating only one very simplistic partthroughout the book. 2D CAD in few pages, a touch of 3D a splashof surfacing and you are done. The simplistic part isn't evenmachined properly. The treatement order is also out of wack.3D machining followed by drilling?. For this price the least the authors could have done was to provide a CD. Save your money on this one and buy a professional text on Mastercam."
1,Can I return this book?,"I would like to return this book. It is useless to me. There is a much better book on the market it is called ""Learning Mastercam Mill Step by Step"" by J. Valentino and some other guy. I wish I found this book first. Later..."
1,AN EXPERIENCED MASTERCAM PROGRAMMER,"This book presents a glossover of what is needed to learn the basics of Mastercam. The approach is to simplify by building all the examples and discussions around one part. Stray from that part and you are in trouble. Missing are sufficient details concerning programming in metric, generating CAD geometry in 2D,3D, Surface modelling, chaining 2D toolpaths, editing 2d toolpaths, creating tools, point sorting for drilling, typesof pocketing toolpaths, editing machining operatings, rotating,translating and mirroring toolpaths and an index etc, etc...."
2,Too blend,This book is too blend and too boring. Not well written and poor illustrated. I think the author should not write anymore books. Thank you.
1,holiday wishes,"Holiday wishes and lots of snow all year round to KLM""KLM"",Jeremy""Jeremy"",Tarzan,Joe from Ozarks,Jellebelly,Jackfrost 11787, Jerry and Mr ""Total"".Suggestion: Instead of writing nasty reviews on a subject you do not know, perhaps you should appear on ""Whose line is it anyway"". Who knows, you might be more successful doing that."
2,Didn't do the job,"I'm sorry to say that the Applemate 3 was a great disappointment. I ordered it because it's supposed to be the most versatile of the apple peelers -- ostensibly it can do any combination of peeling, coring, and paring -- and I have to admit that the unit looks quite handsome and is sturdily made. But it simply did not work for me. I wanted something that would peel and core apples, and I couldn't make the Applemate peel efficiently, try as I did to adjust the blade. I experimented on four apples (two fairly hard, two soft), and each time the blade would begin peeling and then would just slide off and merely scrape the skin. I've seen apple peelers work before, and maybe it's something I was doing wrong; all I know is, this model behaved like a nifty-looking invention that isn't quite perfected yet."
5,A great investment,I have owned peelers before. many of them have drop forged prongs that eventually break. Once that happens the whole peeler is gone. this one has replaceable parts and the prongs are sturdy. They are still a molded/pressed on unit but the shaft can be replaced with out trashing the whole unit. I like the ability of pealing and coring with out slicing. we juice the apples so I need them quartered not sliced for my juicer. This is a good buy and I recommend anyone needing a workhorse buy this one.Norpro Apple Mate 3
2,ECONOMY SET,"These drivers are meant for the housewife or student. The handles are designed for small hands and are not very comfortable. The finish is what you would expect from such an inexpensive set.I dont recommend this set for anyone with large hands or the serious tradesman.I use my set for punching,poking,prying open cans etc. I refer to this set as utility and expendable.Why ruin the expensive stuff?? If all your looking for is an every now and then light duty set then these WILL do the job. Now get out and tighten some screws"
4,Kruger's side,"This is a very readble contemporary biography of Paul Kruger's life PRIOR to the 2nd Boer War (1899) told by a very,very good friend of Kruger's. To get the British viewpoint read H. Rider Haggard and/or Col.Coete who also wrote comtemporary account of the events in the Transval in the 1860's-1890's."
4,Great film,Great film and great quality. Love running this through my Yashica and Holga cameras. Nice beautiful artistic true B&W shots.
4,Not BW400CN,"I got this because you can no longer get Kodak BW400CN and this was the only C-41 120 format monochrome film. While it performed quite well in exposure, it did not produce the look I was going for. I have nothing against this film, or Ilford, it is just an artistic thing. I have two rolls of this sitting in my film fridge for when I need that look, but for now they are waiting. If you are shooting a lot of film and are looking for something slightly different in the look of your B&W; photos give this a shot, it might not be my look, but it could be yours. If you shoot film you know what I'm talking about.If this film gives you the look you want it would be a 5 star film for you."
5,A solid way to have one power cord from your home theater center,"Does its job. Mainly I got it so I wouldn't have several cables running from my entertainment center, but only one, so I could easily move it (it's on casters). Puts all the cord mess behind your other components. Feet and rack mount parts can be removed with a screwdriver. Shows how much current you're drawing (approximately, with a 5 light meter). All metal casing."
4,Jake is great.....DVD doesn't do him justice!,"While this is the best DVD showing Jake in concert and even a face-on demonstration of ukulele technique and stylings, there is a tendency for the camera work to become a distraction. In one segment of Jake playing in a small cafe type environment, why does the cameraman try to get fancy (or maybe trying to show photo techniques) by filming Jake with a post in the way, or focusing on his back?. I found myself trying to get the camera back to Jake playing his ukulele and watching his amazing hands and fingers fly across the strings. To me, the focus should be on the amazing talent of Jake Shimabukuro, not the embellishment of the producer's attempt to show how creative he can be to sell this DVD. Sometimes simple is more important than being avant garde. Let Jake sell the product by his playing......and let the producers humbly get out of the way."
2,For Advanced Players,Jake Shimabukuro is an unbelievable ukulele player and a fantastic guy. This DVD is definitley for advanced players. He demonstrates some very difficult techniques that would take most people years to master. He shows you the techniques one time and then plays them at full speed! Beginners & intermediates might find this a bit frustrating but the DVD will definitely show you the unlimited possibilities and potential of the ukulele
4,as only jake can do it,"This is a good dvd for learning about Jake's style. It isn't for the total beginner (e.g. no explanation about fingering for chords), yet his explanations of strumming techniques are simple and effective. The performances are also very good, though since the DVD is a bit old (2004) it doesn't feature some of the songs that really show off his maturing talent (e.g. While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Ehime Maru, are not on this DVD).All in all, I would recommend this, as Jake's style is unique and very cool."
4,Good read,This story kept moving and Stephanie Bond incorporated her own brand of humor. A fun book...don't have to think too much...just enjoy the story as it moves along.
4,Great Girl Read,This was such a fun read that I couldn't put down. I'll definitely be reading more authors by Stephanie Bond.
1,JUST A BROCHURE,DISAPONING. JUST A BROCHURE TO SELL ALL HIS GADGETS. I GOT CAUGHT BECAUSE I HAD READ THE SHORT GAME BIBLE THAT I THOUGHT WAS SUPER.
1,cannon pixma mp150,this all in one is a total load of shite. it wont let u scan a document if you havent any ink cartridges installed. even if you dont ever use the printer you still have to shell out on ink to be able to scan documents
1,Garbage,"I bought this printer to replace the MP130 my ex took with her thinking that the pile of $3 a piece black and color ink cartridges would work on the MP150. Nope. Of course I bought the model that has $24-30/piece ink that is a different style that the 130. I tried a refill kit for it and it was a joke. Ended up covered in ink, and resetting the printer to recognize the ink is a pain in the ass. My advice find a printer that is good quality that also has cheap ink cartridges before buying."
2,Average to poor,"I have quite a few Cannon products some are better than others. This is just my experience with the MP150 all in one printer. I used it for basic scanning of worksheets, some pictures and average printing. Overall it worked good scanning and printing but after a year the printer part stopped working internal carrige problem with error messages."
2,some problems,"I have a canon ''all in one'' at the office so bought this one for home as I was very happy with the high end model. Print quality is excellent except for two complaints: I was using just black ink to conserve color but the software is telling me color ink is finished! Also the cartridges leak blue ink consistantly and I have a small blue stain on the corner of many sheets. And as many people state, it eats ink cartridges quickly. Would not buy again."
2,prints well but broke when I changed the ink,"I loved this printer, it printed my pictures beautifully but after four months of use I went to change the ink and a little plastic strip completly fell out of the printer. I had no idea where to place the strip and when I put the ink in the machine it kept coming up with an error message. I contacted the company and they never emailed my back on how to fix this problem. So to make a long story short I bought a new printer."
2,"Poor printer, not bad for a scanner.","I thought I was getting a good deal, paying only around $100 for this printer/scanner/copier. But the ink cartridges were very expensive and didn't last long. Also, it pooped out on me after only a year. I still use it as a copier/scanner, but I went back and bought an HP since I have had great success with the HP brand in the past, and their cartridges are much more reasonable."
2,Great value but has a glitch,"Copy and scan functions are great and I love the design. The problem that I have is that after a few months of using it, I'm getting a blotch of dark ink on the top left hand corner of the pages that it prints. Sometimes the splattered ink is about the size of a dime! This is a huge turn off as all of the other features seem to work great. The first page also takes an aweful long time to print."
4,Seems like a nice printer and there is a way to save ink!,"Just purchased this printer with a notebook bundle and ending up only paying $49.99 after rebates so for that price I'm happy. We have a very nice HP wireless all-in-one but bought the Canon for my daughter who is college bound. The HP is definitely nicer and quieter but we also paid 5 times as much!Set up was very easy. For those who are looking to save ink do not use the Canon task bar to print. Go to the main task bar and select File, then Print, Preferences, Custom, then Set. Select the fastest print quality for draft printer and a little higher for other printing. You will save a lot of ink!I also tried the scanner and copier and both seem to work fine."
1,Ink Eater,"We bought this printer after our old HP finally died. My sister and I both take online classes and we use it quite a lot. It prints fine,but that being said, it is a horrible purchase!It eats ink faster than any printer I have ever seen. We have had to buy ink 3 times,this month already.The ink from this printer doesn't come cheap either. We are shelling out over $150 a month on the ink alone.This printer is also very tiresome,you have to have the paper in the printer exactly the right way or it won't work.So unless you are willing to spend tons of money every month,DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER!"
4,WiFi User,First this is a very unscientific review. I use Verizon's FIOS and the router that comes with FIOS. It has the small antenna. Not that I live in a large house but I have a home office in the front and my bedroom is in the back. I could not use my laptop in the back of the house. Now I have 3 bars and it works perfectly. Even in the back yard. Installation: like a light bulb unscrew the old one and screw in the new one. Even I did it the first time. The best price I could find in Dallas was $40.00.Overall this did everything I wanted. Connection threw the house and even the back yard.
1,Waste of money,"These antennas were used with a Linksys router and produced NO noticeable increase in signal strength or performance, even in the plane perpendicular to the antennas."
5,Good blades a must,"These blades are required for the Logan fixture, and they work fine. I need to use a new blade after cutting two or three mats."
5,Thanks for Prompt deliverly~,received the item on time of when we needed it most. We haven't used the extra blades yet but i believe it is the same blade asone its on the cutter... Cutter works find and love it. Thank you.
4,little things come together,"Lucky Number Slevin is definitely one of those movies you can't get up for five minutes, come back, and still understand the ending (trust me, I saw it in theatres and it was impossible to explain it.) However, it is a totally great movie. The characters are very entertaining, as are the twists. Definitely recommended."
4,Good cast. Weak story.,"The cast is amazingly good. This is a suspense movie in a way. But it isfar from another ""Usual Suspect"", ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Memento"" as thestory itself is not too logical and believable. The only thing to keepthis movie going is the violent scenes and to try to find out what isreally happening toward the end of movie. The violence is much moregruesome than what the trailers depict."
2,"Whoa, the wallpaper, man","I watched Lucky Number Slevin tonight. My overall impression is that, while it was not bad, the wallpaper upstaged all else. Really, why would you want the wallpaper to be such a distraction? I could really hardly focus on anything else. I mean, I really didn't need to since I'd figured out their little twist early on, but it was sort of obnoxious how hard they were trying to make the movie look good. No real beauty in it, just in-your-face, ""my aren't we so bold and stylish?""-ness."
3,Violent,"Lucky Number Slevin is a movie about mistaken identity. Slevin (Josh Hartnett) is having a bad day - he got laid off, found out his girlfriend was cheating on him, etc. Slevin decides to go to his friend Nick Fisher's apartment. Various mobsters think Slevin is actually Nick Fisher.The good points about this movie - the acting was great. From Morgan Freeman to Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu, Josh Hartnett, and Bruce Willis, they all do a convincing job. The storyline keeps the viewer entertained, and there are some cool twists. There are also a couple of funny lines.The bad parts - a lot of violence, some language and some parts of the story. I can't elaborate on some parts of the story though without giving the plot away.The movie was nice to watch once, if you can handle the violence."
3,Good Movie with Audio Problems,"I enjoy the movie but almost returned it because the dialogue is so quiet, I had to turn up my receiver 10db just to get it to a ""normal"" audio output. Video quality is decent, but it just doesn't provide that 'pop' like other titles I own. Overall, I would recommend renting the HD DVD version first to see if some of the problems present are enough to detract you from owning this film."
4,smart thriller,"This was fun. Bloody, witty, and cool. A nice thriller with a bunch of bankable stars attached (Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kinsley, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, the list goes on). Enjoyable to the last moment, even if the ending is a bit too Hollywood."
3,Good movie but only worth watching once,This movie is a rent and not a must own. Only bought it because of the HD DVD fire sale.
1,"awful, starts ""funny"" turns ugly.","i hated this movie. it's totaly artificial. from start to finish. i know, they all are but this one's worse than most. and it's offensive, with the rabbi and the boss charactors. i can't figure out what they were going for here. an edgy ""whole nine yards""? who knows. but whatever it was they failed. this is an ugly, offensive mess. avoid it like the plague."
1,Total Loss,"I am almost at a loss for words in reaction to this film. I really feel this is because in itself, the film lacked substance. My first sensation from this came from the cover, which I feel sums it up well: Some good looking people with guns.The rest of the movie follows this, as the story line feels like an empty encasement waiting to be filled. The main character is in the ""Wrong place at the wrong time"" and because of his mental disability he is unable to feel worry. Well, I similarly had very little emotional involvement with the plot of this film as I watched the main character blow in the wind.I watched this character sway about as he accidentally had to introduce the viewer to pointless violence and sex scenes. Did they add to the movie? Well, they pretty much were the movie, as there was nothing else. It was simply an excuse to throw all of the elements of an ""edgy"" movie into one box."
1,Vile Manipulative Trash---a waste of the great Morgan Freeman & Sir Ben Kingsley.,Josh Hartnett is wonderful. Sexy and funny. Sharp. The movie is mildly amusing and involving. Then the violence escalates to a mind numbing degree. At which point the movie becomes vile. Garbage. Worthless. Crap.
1,Make sure you have an HD DVD Player,"I am a soldier in Iraq, and I thought you could play it on a regular DVD player or computer, I was wrong. Dont buy any HD movies if you do not have an HD DVD player already."
3,Nothing Special Here,"This film is a rip off of so many before. It reminds of those English guy Richie films where characters are criss crossed and intertwined and the plot is so twisted that it's predicatble how it will end....Although the major twist was lost to me.This is worth the watch but the big named stars take the believability out of this film ..at least for me. I wont try to summerize this film for you as such a summary will only serve to confuse you. This is a film where you can have lots of laughs as well as thrilling action scenes and violence; especially in the first hour.It's a recommend if you like movies like Lock stock , Revolver, and snatch."
1,Caveat Emptor,"That's ""Buyer Beware"", for those of you who have forgotten the Latin lessons from parochial school. These folks that sell used DVDs provide a useful service, but be careful: If yours arrives scratched (like mine did) you'll be in the same pickle I was in: How do you justify taking the time to get a refund or a replacement on a $ 4 purchase? Anyway, just remember that when you drop the order. I bought this just to have an archive copy of my all-time favorite movie, but two scenes were damaged. Wasn't awful, just annoying. Sometime when I get a minute, I'll probably bet another $4 on the Lottery and order another one, to see if this time I get a winner !"
5,Came really quickly,I got it in two days. I love this movie and it was in good shape when it arrived. And the description is all true.
3,The Twist,this movie has a lot of language in it but the twist at the end makes it all worth wading through.
3,Good Movie,"It was a little darker than I was really hoping for, but it was a good, fun movie nonetheless. There ya go."
2,Great acting; poor script and direction,"""Lucky Number Slevin"" is chock full of fantastic performances from great actors like Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. Lucy Liu, Josh Hartnett and the rest of the cast also do fantastic work. But the direction is poor. We see the strings in a lot of the scenes; dialogue being fired back and forth in an artificial and stilted manner - the fact that's across the board means it's a directorial and not an acting problem.And the script. Wow. It's a second draft Tarantino clone that needed a couple more drafts to be worth shooting. It's chock full of unbelievable coincidence, unnecessary complication, and uneven pacing.This may be worth a rent. But ""Lucky Number Slevin"" should not be purchased until you've spent a couple dollars on a rental."
4,Discover a treasure of a revenge movie,"Well crafted with rich characters and witty dialog, The story line is interesting, and well eveloped. A perfect two hour escape. Entertaining and fullfills the promise of a well done film."
4,A Fun Ride,The movie constantly keeps moving making for an enjoyable experience with few slow moments. All actors give noteworthy performances with great moments of levity throughout.
5,"Awsome ,awsome,awsome, for picture, sound and quality.","First let me say TOSHIBA HD DVD PLAYERS had several annoying bugs, for example frozen screens, jumping chapters and the audio and video being out of sync occasionaly. All this was corrected when I plugged the internet ethernet cable in. Took about an hour for the firmware to download and install, after which I have had NO I repeat absolute NO problems. The overall quality of this unit is phenomenal to say the least. I think the previous reviewer needs to upgrade his firmware, sit back relax and enjoy this great film."
3,Intriguing twists untangle at the end,"The movie starts off with loose leads, leaving me guessing what's actually going on. Veteran Bruce Willis is the mysterious card and the rookie Nick Fisher seems helplessly tossed between two rivals Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. Lucy Liu is the beautiful neighbor falling for Nick. The intricate plot has everything perfectly explained in the end - a 15-minute climax. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley face off one another in the top floor board room, not knowing they are just pawns in the game, not until the end. For people who like Ocean Eleven, Inferno Affairs(Hong Kong), this is a film they will thoroughly enjoy."
4,Lucky Little Movie,"This movie shouldn't be as good as it is...Don't let the movie's tag lines and trailers fool you... You'll have a pretty good idea of what's really happening fairly early in the movie... BUT, the script still contains enough cleverness to keep you sitting upright. The script, dialogue and characters are sharp and engaging.And the actors... Superb! No one deserves an Academy nod for thier performances, but they are much more than workman-like. Ben Kingsley was refreshingly good as a Mob boss as was Morgan Freeman. I never cared much for Lucy Liu, but she gives such a good turn as the not shy neighbor that she made me smile during all of her screen time.No, on paper, this movie just shouldn't be this good, but everything from the script to the acting just clicked in very copacetic fashion!"
4,Fun flick,"I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It was suspenseful, twisting and turning this way and that. Just when I thought I knew the answer of what was to happen next, the plot would turn, and more anwers were revealed.If you like Josh Hartnett a little bit now, you will like him even more after viewing this movie. It seems to me like he is growing up gracefully, out of the teen movie paradigm, into succeeding as a young adult actor.Bruce Willis is also good, taking a bit of a backseat in his role but steady throughout. The sexy Lucy Liu is practically the only woman in this movie at all - a lot of action with a little fun..."
4,I'll keep it simple,I'll keep it simple unlike some of these windbags on here who think they are Siskel and Ebert and just like to write 12 page posts to make themselves feel smart. Just deal with me. I'm not as smart as tham so here goes...... this movie good. Me like. You watch. You like.
5,Great movie (even in obsolete format),"I bought this movie because I still had an Xbox 360 HD-DVD drive floating around. But this movie is great for anyone who likes a good action/suspense movie. The comic relief is also very witty and well paced. Bruce Willis is always great, but this is also one of the cooler movies from Josh Hartnett. The first 45 minutes may seem incredibly random, but the ending makes this movie completely worth it!(I also bought this HD-DVD when the blu-ray of the same movie was still heinously expensive)"
4,Lucky Number Slevin,"As already noted Lucky Number Slevin is shot in a very stylised and slick way, which I happened to enjoy. The story keeps you engrossed as it moves at a good pace and all the actors do an OK job that shouldn't make you cringe too much. I liked it more than most films of 2006, and you can do worse for a bit of afternoon entertainment. The twist in the tale was good and it finished with a satisfying ending. Not bad overall, but not outstanding.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,What a waste of time!,"I just watched the HD version of this movie. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are just wrong the cold blooded gangster types. They appear more fatherly gentlemen than nasty mobster. The movie is supposed to be violent, yet I am not on bit scared or repulsed. The characters are just too nice. A good movie is one the will have the audience hating the bad guy and connecting with the good guy or the victim. This one does neither for me. I have seen better crime thrillers, way better."
3,Slevin come Eleven,"If cast and acting could make a movie by themselvesthis would have been a really bit one.As it is, a lot of the plot is pretty obviouswith everybody pretty much ending up dead in this revengeat 20 years. It actually comes out same old, same old, gang landkillings. The casting is better than the movie or the filming."
1,Don't Waste Your Money--or Your Time,"I had to sit through this dreck during my Introduction to Judaism class. The film covers the history of Israel from 1948 to the present. The production values are pretty bad, the sound isn't good, and the footage is lame (to illustrate a terrible blizzard they show youngsters engaged in a snowball fight). Plus, the narrators are British, which I found to be in very poor taste. There are many excellent videos on Israeli history out there. This isn't one of them."
5,love this book,"It seems a bit old fashioned now (no cell phones, for instance), but still the old romance is still there, the notion of traveling across time to meet the person of your heart is timeless and classic and this is one of the best."
3,Okay,It's okay. I wasn't overwhelmed or amazed but I did finish it. The main character is just too much of a pushover.
5,great read,I just LOVE this book! I've read it over a dozen times. I'm still waiting for them to make a movie.
3,Hey Jude!,"Okay, I am not a girl for romance novels (heavy breathing in print gets a bit squicky at times)...BUT I came across this (hardbound edition) in high school and it made me a Deveraux fan for life. I have most of her crumbly paperbacks (without bosomy, steamy covers like most romance novels) stacked up around my flat. The story here is heartwarming. It almost makes you BELIEVE that this flighty soul-hearted woman with chestnut hair really captured the stubborn and oh-so-male heart of this man across the ages. I've found myself every time my shower water goes cold remembering the passage of the heroine bathing in the fountain, or the idea of cooking for a man bringing pleasure, bringing memories of this book as though they were experiences of my own. In my mind, this makes a great read. It's not Faulkner or Oates or even Margaret Mitchell...but it is delightful, engaging, and if you're dabbling in picking up a lighthearted trip through some pages- pick this, you'll like it!"
3,A lot to like and some not to like,I love time travel. I love Jude Deveraux. But this one I am not too sure about. The main character's name of Douglass was a little confusing at times. She whines. Women are treated badly in parts. Not that women aren't treated badly for real .... I just prefer stronger ladies. The whole thing was lacking...... something.
3,"In my opinion, not as wonderful as stated by reviewers!","If A Knight In Shining Armor is Jude Deveraux at her best, I was not inspired to read any other books by this author. I found her style of writing to be short and choppy. Although the book was entertaining, I found myself reading it just to finish it. The hero had an interesting personality and the story moved along nicely but I thought the heroine was pathetic. I just think maybe the hype for the book raised my expectations and I found it to be fair reading."
2,Did not enjoy as much as I thought I would...,"I try to stick with a book unless it's absolutely horrendous so I stuck with this one, and at the end I was sorry I did.I couldn't identify with Dougless, the heroine because she, first of all, stuck with her bad boyfriend so long, then second, she even *thought* of going back to him! Lastly, I was SO disappointed at the ending. Everyone said this was her best book? I probably won't read the others then!"
5,"Fun, hard to put down",After reading all four Diana Galbadon books(which were great)I needed a short fun book. This filled the order. Loved the contrast between the two eras. I would highly suggest this book.
5,A great read,"This is the first time I have ever read a time travel book and was at first skeptical as I have trouble reading books that can't possibly be real. Nevertheless, I read it because the reviews listed here were outstanding. I have to agree with the 100+ readers that gave this book 5 stars. Ms. Deveraux has outdone herself. I didn't know how this was going to end but knew it wouldn't be exactly as I wanted it to, it would be too far fetched. The ending was much much more than I had expected. I closed the book with a knot in my throat."
5,A Historical Romantic Fantasy,"You'll laugh, cry, become angry and almost every other emotion possible. You won't want it to end. Douglass is a well rounded character and the fun and fantasy will carry you. Time travel can be so much fun. My All Time Favorite."
5,The most romantic story I have ever read,This was the absolute best book I have ever read. My family and I went to England and all I could think about was this book and how magical a story it is. It is a story of timeless love.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I expected so much more with this story then what I got. It had so many great reviews. However, the female lead ""Dougless"" is a millionaire's daughter and will inherit a fortune when she turns 35 yet her whole ""goal"" in life is to find a man to love and marry him.... YIKES! Of course, every man uses her but then again every man she looks at she looks at as a future husband. Hmm... Anyhow, I found the book very frustrating - didn't finish it and put it in the discard box. The story was beyond ridiculous and if romance is chasing after a man - then this story is for you."
1,Fluffy Waste Of Time,"This book was a big disappointment. The book's character's are 2-dimensional, flat and boring. The author doesn't draw detailed enough characterizations. Her writing is at best uninteresting and at worst childish. I though the book was light, fluffy, brain-candy, and it didn't make me want to read any other books by this author. I wanted rich detail, descriptive text, engaging dialogue and I got nothing even close to that. Ugh... no more Jude Deveraux for me."
5,An Excellent Read!,"This is the first book that got me started reading Jude Deveraux's work. Witty, full of adventure and very sensual. I loved the character Nicholas when he is in both modern times and in his own age. And you cannot help but sympathize with Dougless for I'm sure that many of us have been jilted by someone we loved. After reading A Knight in Shining Armor, I can't get enough of Ms. Deveraux books! Also recommend reading: The Taming."
4,A study in co-dependency,"This is a fairly well-written novel with an interesting and entertaining storyline. While the author claims to be writing about alcoholism and ""alcoholic personalitites"", the book is more effective as a look into how a co-dependent person thinks and behaves. Dougless, the main character, is a *classic* co-dependent in her relationship early in the novel, and then, through her relationship with Nicholas, she finds the courage and self-respect to discover that love doesn't involve letting her partner use and walk all over her.Overall, I think the book is a good, entertaining, easy read. I don't usually like romance novels, but the history side of the story kept me interested and entertained the whole way through."
5,This book will touch you and leaving you wanting more!!!!,"I came upon Ms. Deveraux accidentally and ""A Knight in Shining Armor"" is by far one of the best romance novels anywhere. The time travel element allows you to enter this world of fiction fully while at the same time offers insight into how we can live in real-time and be a better person. The charectors are fully drawn out and the novel reads easily, full of detail and historical accuracies. You will find yourself aching to be held with Nicholas and live the adventures with Dougless. I recomend this book for anyone who is looking for a novel so full of life and love it will leave you crying (literally) for more. Definitly on my list of 100 books to read in this lifetime. Enjoy!!"
5,This book will make you believe anything is possible,"This is the first book that has ever made me cry, and laugh out loud. I started reading the book and had to call out sick the next day, I couldn't put it down and stayed up all night to finish it. This book will make you believe that there is a Nicholas out there for everyone who believes."
5,Awesome!,"I was given this book from one of my sisters to return to my other sister and I figured why not read it first. I loved it totally! I laughed, I cried, I couldn't sleep at night wondering how it was going to end! It was only the second romance book I've read and I'm hooked. I only wish there was a second book to continue Douglass's story..."
3,"While I love time travel, this left a bad taste","I love anything to do with time travel and while I enjoyed the time period Nicholas lived in, I wasn't crazy with the ending of the book. I liked everything else about the book and thought the chemistry between the two characters was really good.It was because of the ending I did not rate it higher."
2,Not for me...,"I only picked up this novel because a friend threatened my life--and I nearly ended hers after reading it. I've read a novel from this author before and didn't like her style of writing; it's written with too many facts, and not enough emotion, which is what I look for in a ROMANCE novel. I want to connect with characters, empathize and weep and ache with them since I'll be spending so much time with them anyway--this author does not provide that, and although this tale is interesting, it falls flat due to lack of character/reader affinity.The heroine seems very likable, although you only get to know her in a single wave-length way, and the hero sounds dashing, although he's sometimes parched, I did like the way the story circled back to the beginning, giving it wholesome synchronicity--but I think that was it.And the ending...The only word I can think of to describe myself, especially after not enjoying the book so much anyway, is inconsolable."
3,A good summer read,"This is the first book I have read by Jude Deveraux and one of the few romances I have read (to date anyway). I really enjoyed the banter between the characters and I liked the time travel....to a point. I thought there was too much of it, but I can see how it was needed with the changing history and such. Now the ending was so heartwarming and full of hope I can't forget it. All in all a good read and enough to tempt me into trying some of Ms. Deveraux's other books."
5,Great Book!,"This book got me reading again. The romance was outstanding. I love this book. It made me cry from happiness and sadness. If you don't like a book like that, quit reading! On a scale of 1-10 I give this book an 11 in my opinion. It is in my library forever now. :)"
5,A true keeper,I have read this book a few times or more over the years. I had to get rid of my books except for a few and this is one I couldn't part with. I have to say it is my absolute favorite book. The story gives you a warm feeling in your gut and you wish you could switch places with Douglass to be loved so much that the love flows through time and is remembered. This is a really must read book. I also say...her boyfriend in the story got what he deserved. What a cold fish he was. Loved ...loved the book.
5,The Best!!!!,"This is the best romance that I have ever read by Jude. I laughed, cried, it made me want to be the heroine! I was drawn into the story, I couldn't put it down. Remarkable. I felt like I was there."
5,One of the Best Love Stories Ever!!!!,"This was only the second romance novel I had ever read, and I have been hooked on Jude Devereaux ever since! I never thought after reading this book that I would find my own ""Knight in Shining Armour,"" but sure enough I did. This book pulls your heart into every emotion possible: happiness, anger, sadness, and love. I can honestly say this is a book I would recommend to anyone who has loved and lost, or who has never loved at all; it will bring you hope. I will reread this book for many years to come."
3,SECOND HALF SAVED THIS BOOK---,"The first half of this story was so bad it was painful to read. The writing was stale and the heroine was so desperate to get married that she was embarrassingly pathetic. She was praying for a knight to love, the hero was praying for his family's traitor to be revealed, and I was just praying for the whole thing to end.Once there was a switch in locations, the writer seemed to find her stride. The action picked up, the love story developed and I cried a few surprising tears at the end. Still, not sure I care to try another book by this author."
5,Jude Deveraux,"Love Love Love this Book. I have already read this book, The Knight In Shining Armor 3 times, since i purchased this copy, when i was younger i read it lots of times also,, My youngest son is named Nicholas after the Knight in Shining Armor, Pretty cool huh, I strongly Recommend this book to all the hopeless Romantics out there!"
5,"A wonderful, anytime pick-me-up!","This is the most fabulous love story I've ever read...and re-read at least twenty times!The story is a great way to beat off the winter blahs and warm your heart to the possibility that anything is possible when you are truly in love. I've read this book at least twice a year since discovering it in 1992. Ms. Deveraux has the most interesting way of including persons from her famously fictional ""Montgomery"" family in any book which she mentions the family name.This is a good, weepy read and I would suggest it to all those who still believe."
5,"Captivating and Unique, not what I usually read, but...","So glad I did! The book starts out slow, so you have to stay with it. The author develops these characters well and if you can get past how COMPLETELY ANNOYING the heroine is the first third of the book, you realize no matter how irritated you are, she actually grows on you. Now as for the hero...YUM. He withstands from start to finish, endearing to say the least. I give it five stars because it truly pulls you in as a reader. I'm not usually fond of time travel books, but this author does a nice job with the genre."
2,Research?,"I downloaded this book to read on holiday in Greece. After several chapters I became rather disenchanted and indeed rather cross. The author chose Ashburton, England as her 'remote' village. I lived there in 1969 and have been back there recently so was pleased to discover the story using the village as a setting. However it lost its credibility when she describes a busload of 50 Japanese tourists stepping out. That will never happen in sleepy Ashburton, we don't have sidewalks, and the streets are not arranged in 'blocks'. Police have not been referred to as 'bobbies' since the 1950's and the final straw came when Douglass ordered scones and describes slathering the scone in clotted cream with no mention of jam - sacrilege! It may seem petty but it would be like me choosing a remote town in America and describing pavements instead of sidewalks etc. Write about what you know or do the research. It may have been a good story but I will never know."
5,Would make a great movie!,"I bought this book when it first came out, and read it from cover to cover without putting it down.It is ABSOLUTELY the best romance novel I have ever read. I always try and have an extra copy to give to a friend who hasn't read it yet.You won't be disappointed in this one. I think it would make a great movie!"
2,Ending was too sad. Writing style and conversations lacking.,"I didn't care for the author's writing style. Parts of it seemed like a reporter was writing events that were happening each day. The author was trying too hard to make us not like Robert and his daughter. They were too bad to be believable. Dougless's reasoning didn't feel real to me. I wouldn't think or act like her. Conversations were not interesting. During parts of the middle the reading was tedious and I wanted the book to be over. The last few chapters had me in tears far too much. Yes it was a great love spanning time, but too much sadness. SPOILER: The worst sadness for me was that Nicholas lived the rest of his life back in the 1500s never marrying because he loved Dougless. Even though there was an interesting ending with her finding someone, I was still in tears so I do not consider this a feel good book. Sexual content: moderate."
5,Enchanting Escape,"""A Knight In Shining Armor"" swept me away to a land that was enchanting. I applaud Jude Deveraux for this beautiful story. Once I started reading this book, I had to finish it and by the end of the story I wished Nicholas for my own. The story is exceptional because it not only occurs in the present, but takes you to land of a different time. The outcome is an enchanting escape from reality for a brief period of time."
5,It doesn't get better than this !!,"I have to say I LOVE THIS BOOK. I have to admit that I almost put it down in the beginning because I hated the way Dougless was so submissive in the beginning. But I stuck it out, and BOY AM I GLAD I DID. This is they best romance novel I have read by far. I love they way Jude takes you through 2 eras and they ending....WONDERFUL !! I couldn't stop crying. I started to get very sad as I got closer to finishing the book because I knew, and know now, that I would miss the characters. BRAVO !!!!"
4,An unforgettable story,"This was a thoroughly enchanting read. I normally don't read romance novels but discovered this book through a cousin of mine when it first came out. I've since reread it once or twice. If you are looking for a love story that is both light and thought-provoking, then read this. It had its sad and joyous moments and the hero and heroine are both as spirited as they come. It makes a good 'beach read' but has a little something extra that makes it an unforgettable story. Extremely appealing."
5,AWSOME!!,Great book worth every penny. I couldn't put it down and I let all my friends borrow it so they can read it. You must read this book!! Jude you are awsome.
1,Craptastic,"Wow.... I really can't believe this book got so many good reviews. Reading the first few chapters of this book is like listening to nails on a chalk board. The ""heroine"" (AKA the Doormat) of this book makes me cringe so badly that I can read no further. She is so very gullible and whiny. She's in a horrible relationship because she wants to get married and if she doesn't get that ring on her finger she will be some sort of failure. She may not be after his money but she expects him to pay for everything and waxes dramatic when he cons her into going dutch. He treats her like garbage and it goes right over her head or she just lays down and takes it because he might propose to her ""someday"". That's just the tip of the iceberg, it just gets worse from there on. I couldn't even make it to the part where she loses all hope in life at being dumped by the douche. If you haven't already guessed, I'm wishing I hadn't wasted my money or my time."
1,None,terrible waste of time - story line was repeated over and over as if author was trying to fill in space due to writers block - what a bummer!
1,UGH!!!,"After reading all the wonderful reviews here, I was really looking forward to this story. I love a nice romance, even a little time travel (loved Outlander!). But this was just not for me. The story is very predictable and extremely corny. I definitely do not recommend!"
1,"Weep, weep, weep","It seemed like all this broad did was cry, cry and cry. I guess with an ending like this she was justified. A few historical factoids thrown in, but the heroine was extremely unlikeable. I will never read anything by this author again."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this novel, because although a fantasy, it didn't seem feasible.The characters were unexciting - the heroine cried throughout most of the book - the hero was a chauvanist in both past and present and the ""baddies"" were so bad as to be unbelievable."
5,One of the best books I have ever read,This book was awesome. It was the first Jude deveraux book that I have read and it was the best. I couldn't put it down! This book is great and the end is bittersweet but I still loved it.
4,What a ride!,"I loved being on this ride. I did not feel bored at all as I was dragged about emotionally through this story. The characters were so real to me, and I suffered along with the heroine in her times of sorrow. The ending is certainly memorable, but I haven't decided yet if I like it or not. Either way, it was a very good read and time well spent."
3,Meh...,Not a terrible story but clearly dated. The main character needs therapy. The obvious neediness was a detractor from the story for me.
4,One of the better books the Romance genre has to offer...,"I like a lot of depth of plot to counterbalance love stories, and I rarely find romance novels that have enough external action to please me. While this book doesn't offer as much in the way of plot as I usually like, I found it to be a sweet, light-hearted and compelling read. There were no earth-shattering moments of emotion for me, but there were some very amusing and touching parts that brought a smile to my face. Devereaux manages to tug at the heart strings without being overly saccharine or compromising character integrity.If you're looking for something with the complexity of Gabaldon's writing, you may end up disappointed with this.. But if you want a light read that centers around a dashing knight, a modern woman and a healthy dose of humor, this book is well worth the asking price."
1,A Failed Attempt,"I hate to beat a dead horse (or a dead novel), but this pathetic patch of prose is more than poorly written; it is a failed attempt at what could have been an enjoyable read. The premise of the story, a bending of time, is an interesting basis for a plot, but it is of a nature which requires deft handling and an artful writing style, neither of which are to be found in this novel. It is populated with cartoonish characters, none of whom are particularly likeable, who are so unlifelike as to reach beyond the ridiculous, afflicted with childish dialogue and unbelievably distorted judgement. In a word -- Yuk!"
4,Lovely Time Travel Romance,"A friend who loves time travel novels recommended this book to me. It was my first (surely not my last) Jude Deveraux novel. It's a lovely story taking place in rfural England.An American woman, Dougless, from 1988 meets an aristocrat from 1564 Elizabethan England, Nicholas.To give away more would be a pity...read it and enjoy it!"
2,Not for me.,"I'm not into time travel, but I thought I would give this book a chance. I shouldn't have wasted my time. I had a very hard time finishing the book. I do not recommend."
3,"Wondeful Story, Horrible Ending","This was a wonderful book, however the ending was very disappointing. If you like happy endings this is not the book to read. The entire book is their struggle to remain together, to cheat time, but in the end no matter how much they love each other, it was just not meant to be. This was a wonderful book by Jude Deveraux to read and one day I hope she will continue Nicholas and Dougless's story in a second book."
5,My Favorite Book of All Time,"I loved this story. It is the best romance book that I have ever read! Time Travel and Romance, and Humor this story has it all. I laughed and Cried.This story has so much to offer and it is incredibly touching. The characters are likeable and I really did not want the story to end. If you can get your hands on any version of this story. It would be well worth the effort!"
5,The ultimate romance novel!,"If you're looking for a book you'll cherish for the rest of your life, this is it! Bar none, A Knight in Shining Armour is the best romance novel on the market today. You will love Nicholas and Dougless - their love story will stay with you long after you have read this book... which would only mean that it's time to read it again! You will laugh with them, cry with them and feel all the other emotions that are portrayed so eloquently by the author. This is Jude Deveraux at her best! (To clue you in on just how wonderful this book is, I convinced my die hard Marine Corps MP hubby to read this book - he enjoyed it so much he even brought it to work so he could finish it there!)"
5,One of my favorites ever,"I treasure this book and will not give it away, although I will loan one of my copies to somebody I like to share the enjoyment. I laughed, I cried, I got almost nothing else done while I read it. For me it ranks up there with ""Whitney, My Love"" by Judith McNaught and ""Outlander"" by Diana Gabaldon as a treasure to keep and re-read."
5,My Favorite Jude Deveraux Book!!,This was the first Jude Deveraux book I read. My sister gave it to me and I absolutely LOVED it!! I re-read it from time to time and never get tired of it.
4,Get past the first couple of chapters and it is a fun read.,"This is the first time I've read Jude Deveraux. Honestly though, I almost put the book down never to pick it up again. The first few pages really got me going. I couldn't believe Douglas would put up with a man like her boyfriend. I mean to make her pay her own way, put up with his spoiled kid, and THEN leave her alone without money, etc. in a strange land. I was really steamed at that point so much so I just could not read further. Later in the evening I was going to read for just a little while and ended up finishing the book in one sitting."
5,One of my favorites!,"I just finished reading Jude Deveraux's ""A Knight in Shining Armor,"" and I must say it is one of the best romance novels I have ever read (and believe me, I have read a few!). The story not only sends the reader on many twists and turns, through different ages and different emotions, but it ends wonderfully as only a Deveraux book could. I highly recommend this book to anyone!"
3,Not bad,"A Knight in Shining Armor was such a disappointment. When I picked up the book, I expected an amazing story since it got great reviews from amazon readers, but I guess I was disillusioned when I finished the story. I can't describe it, but the book was ok, one which you would expect of jude deveraux, but it was not a book you would like to have alongside your other favorite books, there was nothing special or timeless about this story, nothing you can dream about forever. If you want an amazing story, wherein you can laugh and cry, go for jude deveraux's remembrance and the conquest."
3,It could have been better,"I loved the first half of the book where Nicholas came forward in time. The last half of the book was fair at best. It was just too, too hard to believe that she travelled back with her bag full of magic and that those people accepted it so easily. Often I did not care for Douglass' choice of words. They just weren't believeable."
3,I almost had to put this book down,I don't like books that are set in the 80's. I try to block out that decade as much as possible and pretend that it was all just a dream. Yikes! I kept thinking that they would go back to the 1500's but it took soooooo long. Dougless was way too needy and unlikable throughout the first 1/3 of the book that I almost didn't continue reading. Once they did return to the 1500's the book became a little more enjoyable.SPOILER***I didn't like the quick fix at the end. I kept thinking about poor Nicholas spending his entire life alone. It wasn't a happily ever after for me.
3,okay,"The book was in the condition that was described, which I am very pleased with, they are a very good company to get books from. They are good on their word for what they say they will deliver."
1,PULEEEZ!!,"This book was both boring and insipid. The main characters had no chemistry whatsoever and the ending was a complete let down. This was my first Jude Devereaux book and will definitely be my last. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. If you feel you must read it, take it out of a library!"
1,Use this book for fire wood. It is absolutely wretched!!,"I used to like reading this author's books, but after this tragic attempt at writing, I don't think I'll be reading any more. This book went sailing across my room to the trash pile."
5,Truley for the hopeless romantic,"I have never cried so much while reading a book as I did with this one...This book is truely what dreams are made of..I loved the setting of the book,in present time and elizabethan time.The chemistry between Dougless and Nicholas just made my heart skip a beat.Jude just had a way of writing in this book that made me believe and hope this could actually happen..Well done Jude."
5,Romance & Passion all rolled into one.,"I am not a big readed of any books, until a girlfriend of mine gave me a Jude Deveraux book to read. She told me once I started it I would never but it down, and you know what she was right. Since then all I have been reading are Jude Deveraux Books. its like I cant get enough of them A Knight in Shinging Armour is a one of a kind,it give you the feeling that you are there. I am just finishing the Legend and it to is great. All I can say is JUDE DEVERAUX you are a great romance writer, and keep up the good work. P.S THE LIBRARY knows me by name now. And not just because of the card.. Thank you JUDE"
5,Romance+Historical=GREAT BOOK!,This is an enchanting book that will touch the hearts of all who read it. Absolutely the best Jude Deveraux book yet
4,A Beautiful Powerful Love Story.,"A beautiful powerful love story that seriously does capture your heart. After reading it, it was all that I thought about. Honestly, I even kinda didn't like it because it captured my thoughts and I had some homework to do. However the love between Nicholas and Dougless was sooo powerful. Good Job once again Jude, you never fail to amaze me with your work.I highly reccomend this book, but becareful, your heart will be captured instantly.Wonderful.."
1,Okay...,Okay. This is NOT the original Best of Bond CD. This is CD is by some orchestra/singing group. Wasted a few dollars. Might as well just get the real thing.
2,Just one more CD of interpretations of 007 music,"As these types of CDs go this is average at best. I reluctantly admit that I did like the James Bond Theme (Extended Version) and James Bond Theme (Dance Version). My actual opinion of this product is that the cover design and artwork far exceeds the music. You may consider it if you are a James Bond collector. If you truly want the James Bond music you hear in the films, I recommended starting with the soundtrack recordings."
1,You already know everything in this book,"This is just another prime example of the academic world taking normal things we do everyday and apply a bunch of scientific jargon to try and explain it. If it wasnt for the fact that I have to read this for a Master's class, I would have thrown it out around p.80 and that was after I gave it ample opportunities to redeem itself. If you are extremely bored and looking for something to cure insomnia, I highly suggest this book. I will save you the pain of this book and give it to you in a nutshell. You cannot predict the future but you can prepare for it by looking at trends, performing models and using any and all resources...wow, that is some ground breaking science there. Oh and one more great bit of information this book provided me. I can improve my future by making simple changes today. Seriously? Someone got paid money for writing this and selling it?"
2,No page numbers!,"The content is fine, and expected based on the reviews and such. I purchased this as a Kindle book and it has no page numbers. Pointless for me as a student needing to cite my references! Totally bummed."
4,Good introduction to futuring methods.,"I enjoyed reading the book, which was required for my college course. I learned about the numerous futuring techniques avaiable to help one anticipate future events. I have a much better appreciation of the world around be as a result."
3,Objective?,"It is really hard for me to grasp the objectivity behind the author's projections. I know they are projections geared towards giving us an idea of how the world can work and what we can do to change it or prolong it, but still his methods are a little bit unorthodox to me."
3,"Get this for ""Saturday Afternoon""","In ""Long Pants"" the Langdon character starts to come apart at its seams-Harry does things that are not in character and a lot of this film does not work well. At times, you may scratch your head trying to figure out the inconsistencies here between the child like Langdon and his murderous impulses. ""Saturday Afternoon"", however, is a comic gem-as perfect and delightful a comedy short as was made in the 1920's."
2,Ok if you are fitness illiterate,I am police officer with the ultimate goal of joining my departments E.R.T. team . I know the demands the job calls for. I thought this book would have some detailed protocols the teams use. To my dismay it was like my personal training text book I had in school. If you know nothing about fitness it's for you. If you are a dedicated fitness person or officer leave it on the shelf. I was disappointed.
5,Ageless and Timeless,"The number of stars this book deserves is countless! ""They Didn't Use Their Heads"" was first published in 1960, and my mother gave it to me as a gift in 1964, when I was seven years old. Throughout the years, I've often reflected on this book--pondering its simple, yet profound, lessons and wondering if I'd ever find it again. Well, in the *infinite* wisdom of the publisher, it's back! This truly priceless and beautifully illustrated book speaks to children of *all* ages: Its lessons will remain with you always. This book is a treasure and should be hardbound and displayed proudly on your bookcase among your other prized literature. Better yet, place it conspicuously on your coffee table for visitors to read: People are never too young nor too old to learn... and to grow... and, well, maybe even learn to ""use their heads""..."
3,Language a bit quaint,"I bought this for my 6-year-old with a specific intention: getting him to think more about his actions. But the language is a bit quaint, or dated. The illustrations are just B & W, so that wasn't very attractive for him either."
4,They Didn't Use their Heads,"This is a fun books! It's a bit long, but my 3 1/2 year old really enjoyed it. It was fun to talk about and lead to other discussions. After reading it several times, he even related it when we were out and about to something I asked him not to do. Good book!"
4,Very helpful for its specialized audience,"As an amateur lexicographer at Wiktionary, I am always looking for resources that will help me inform the practice there. Terms with a largely grammatical function (conjunctions, determiners, certain adverbs, and prepositions) are the most difficult for amateurs to work on. This fine book provides masterful examples of how to tease apart the meanings of prepositions (and the related adverbs and particles) and grasp how figurative meanings emerged from the basic spatial senses. It is more systematic and specific than earlier works in the same spirit that pointed the way theoretically.For my purposes the book rates five stars, but I have difficulty understanding how many folks could possibly have a use for it."
2,Again annoyed,"After spending three hours of putting this item together, the holes for the shelves are crooked, or they don't match sides. I am beyond mad tired and upset that I wasted money on this.if it weren't for the fact that its so heavy, I would send it back. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this item"
4,Decent bookcase,"Wasn't that hard to put together as long as you number each piece before you start and pay attention to what you are doing. Good quality for the price. Would be nice if you could turn it around the other way, but the back is not finished so this isn't possible."
5,Savage!,"Innocent Dina Wilmount hid aboard The Pearl Stallion, desperate to return to England. But the vessel provided no safe harbor, for she soon learned that the price of her passage would be her soul... Cast out of London's streets, Anson Saurage had sworn he'd stop at nothing short of revenge. Though he'd not foreseen the influence of Lady Dina, born of a world he despised, yet destined to be his only love!from back cover of book"
1,Lacked depth,"The plot as predictable, the writing was mundane, the characters were characatures. Painful to read, and not worth finishing."
2,Not one of Marty's better efforts,"I think Marty Balin has one of the great rock 'n' roll voices, used on so many occasions to tremendous effect. But it depends on his having good quality material, and on this album the quality just is not there. Several listenings haven't revealed it. The production isn't bad, aside from the cheapo graphics, but I'll keep the disk only because I like having a complete collection of an artist's work. For those who like Marty Balin, the better bets are Better Generation, Bodacious D.F., and any of the first six Jefferson Airplane albums. Everything else I've heard is very hit-or-miss, and this one is one is definitely a miss."
1,really riduculous and Not even worth a laugh!,"I thought this film was interesting because i can see it appears everywhere online; nevertheless, it was really boring and ridiculous and superficial; after seeing the first 20 minutes, i tried to surf through the movie and then turned it off. Not was even worth a laugh!"
5,I love this Film!!,"this movies is a keeper... it is so outrageous and oh, so gay. I had to own a copy for those rainy days when I'm looking for a good laugh or need to entertain some friends..."
4,"very funny, a must buy",for an american movie this was good. the acting is good and the movie is very funny. the boys are also cute.
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Ok... Leave your joke in the comment box, I'm sure it's hilarious. As for this movie, it WAS hilarious... at first... but it quickly got old. Its about four gay friends, the summer before college, on a mission to get laid. Along the way they meet their fair share of weird characters and it's pretty much the same as 1000 other coming of age teen comedies, except for the gay part... This movie has some really funny parts, especially the interaction with the lesbians, THAT was classic! Unfortunately, they continue focusing on the one subject, and the jokes just stop being funny after about twenty minutes or so. It's a cool idea, it's a gutsy film to make, and I give praise to everyone brave enough to be a part of it. It probably would have been good if it wasn't so narrow-minded."
4,Gift,I bought this and the other one for a friend and they love them. So I am glad I was able to find it on here.
5,love it!,"i'm with jeffrey on this one...i love that it took some of our favorite references like mommie dearest and carrie and provided an anecdote to all those movies that straight people get to watch! i love love love this, in fact i suggest showing this at a party or having a movie night with both movies! great fun to be had by all"
5,"Gay Cult Classic.. Hilarious, Scandalous, Pornagraphic and Charming","There are so many reviews, there's hardly reason for more. But here's mine.. short and sweet. 'Another Gay Movie' is hilarious. It's a perfect parody of 'American Pie' complete with every inside-gay joke and full frontal erect male nudity.I think every gay man can relate to at least one of the characters.. or their story arcs. There's romance, coming of age, self-discovery and the raunchiest gay humor possible. The flamboyancy ranges from subtle to shocking, and the boys are more than cute.'Another Gay Movie' completes any queens movie collection. It's a comedy meant just for us, and it's one of my favorites of all time. Give it a try. I promise you'll laugh, and get turned on."
3,fun to watch if you are drunk,even though this movie is funnyit isnt all that goodits sometimes too awkward regardless i got a laugh out of it
2,A very disappointing movie.,"I was really hoping that this movie would be a truly funny movie dealing with gay issues. However, in my opinion it was a movie that was very closely modelled on the movie ""American Pie"", but a lot less funny. Substituting a Quiche Lorraine instead of an Apple Pie, four gay guys instead of four straight ones, someones grandfather instead of Stifler's Mother and a overly loud lesbian instead of 'the Sherminator' does not make this movie all that different from ""American Pie'. I am surprised the makers of this film havent been slapped with a copyright lawsuit. Most roles feed on gay stereotypes and are over-acted to the level of being annoying rather than likeable. Yes, this movie is meant to be a spoof, but its lack of originality severely hampers this aim. Surely the gay film community is capable of a movie with more originality and imagination than this one."
3,Some funny stuff here,"I went into this not knowing what I was going to get but was pleasantly surprised when I rented the movie and was actually laughing out loud quite a bit.In this day and age of most gay movies being about failed relationships and death, it was refreshing to see a light gay comedy about a group of friends trying to get laid just like all the Hetero movies where the [...]boys need to ""Do It"" before Summer's end.There are some way over the top scenes, some spoofs of other teen movies (Carrie anyone?), a few gay reality stars and even a few heart warming moments. Something for everyone.By all means this is not a movie for kids but if you are an Adult and like to laugh, then check it out."
1,god awful,"This movie makes ""American Pie"" look like Shakespeare. Every other one star review is dead on; this movie is torture. For the record: a fair, gay themed comparison with ""American Pie"" would be ""Eating Out."""
3,Overdone and 5.1 Channels Cut Out on Disc,"I agree with what most other reviewers are stating that this film leaves NOTHING to the imagination. I thought it was very, very funny- but felt that almost all the nasty jokes were over done...to the extreme. I personally would of preferred a little left to my imagination-particularly the scene with Richard Hatch-I didn't need to see what Survivor electronically blurred out for the world(they were doing us a favor).On a technical note-the sound on the disc's 5.1 track cuts in and out about half way through the movie. I received a replacement from Amazon and it does the exact same thing in the same spots. The 2.0 tracks are unaffacted however."
4,Another Gay Movie--Tons of Fun!,"A silly, over-the-top gay version of American Pie by the director of Edge of Seventeen. A lot of clever visual humor and some hot (simulated) sex scenes, along with cameos by various gay icons make this a great addition to any gay guy's DVD collection. It also makes a fun gift for those ""friends who have everything""."
4,Must see!,"Hilarious raunchy fun in the tradition of American Pie, only worse. If you aren't easily offended and prefer screwball comedies, this is the one for you. I laughed my butt off through the whole thing. For those of you who are interested, there's also a subplot romance going on between two of the characters that was sweet.Graham Norton's main scene, with the ...ahem... Belgian chocolate, is going to stay in mind for a long, long while."
5,Another Gay Movie Icon,"Love Love Love Love Love this movie, Just the amount of camp and hilarity that ensues is so infectious... You've got every type of gay guy in this move you have the passive the aggressive, the jock the sissy, even the blind girl who has no clue her boyfriend is gay. It just warms my heart to know that directors know how to capture all those feelings and then release them onto the screen, I couldn't stop laughing especially when Muffler would talk, shes got my vote for president one day. Well maybe governor of Kansas..."
3,silly...a real airhead movie...seriously,"this movie was so silly on so many levels and kind of amateur in its acting and directing, but it's cute and kind of stupid/funny, the characters are typical and the cast is not a-list, or b-list for that matter, but it's funny in a air-head gay boy way...some of the scenes were beyond dumb and the actors a little unbelievable and goofy...watch it or don't i'm neutral on this one...albeit there were some hot actors in it though..."
2,Another Gay Movie,"Well Well Well...what to to say about this movie.First off it's a spoof on gay themed movies (like ""scary movie"")so with that in mind don't expect great things from this. It is fun and campy with lots of sight gags and toilet humor. There are many cameos from the likes of Gramm Norton ( he's histerical) and Richard Hatch.We all thought it was ok but not great,I guess we all expected more and got less."
4,I'll Never Look at Produce the Sam Way Again,"Although the edits could be better and feel of the production is cheap, this movie is the perfect send-up of all things teen AND all things gay! If you are not gay, you may find this offensive, if you are gay, you may find this offensive. Therein lies the entertainment value of this quirky comedy."
3,"FUNNY AND CRUDE, BUT HONEST ALSO","are all the gays like these guys in the movie? to an extent we are in some form or fashion. these guys are stereotypes and if you are able to laugh at this movie then that means that you can laugh at yourself. there are some parts of the movie that are just totally crazy and constitute omg moments, but you should know what you are getting into by the title alone. i love it that there were so many gay actors that were in this movie and are proud of it. i like that this movie is not trying to be something that its not. it is over the top and over the top is just fine when it is intentional, it is only sad when you dont mean for things to be over the top. does this movie go to far? i dont think so, like i said a lot of this stuff is intentional so dont take it too seriously and if you do then you are missing the point of the movie, watch with an open mind and enjoy, this is mindless entertainment so just sit back and laugh."
3,Another Teen Sex Story,"School graduates (16-18?) are desperate to get a same sex sexual experience, leaving a reviewer wondering at a difference between ""chastity"" and ""virginity"".It is a classic example of a silly fun movie, which is a comedy surely to watch to relax."
5,Sloppy wants a pussy too!!!!!!,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! IT was Funny and if ""Michael Carbonaro"" wasn't in the film it would not have been as funny. If they ever make a part two. It has to have all of the four lead guys Michael Carbonaro, Jon Chase, Jonah Blechman, and even Mitch Morris. Well... Maybe not mitch, he really didn't get that many laughs. However he did give the movie the realism and emotion. It was more than just a funny movie. I love Step McVay she is sooo funny, love the wal-mart references she made to the film. It is a must see. Hated for it too end, and if American pie can have a lot success then this should too. best spoof yet!"
4,The gay version of American Pie,"I purchased this movie not knowing anything about it because Amazon offered it with another film I wanted for a farily cheap price. And I am so glad that purchased it. This is what American Pie would be if all the characters were gay... with quiche. Four frineds set out during their last free summer before college to loose thir anal virginity urged on by one larger than life Lesbien named Muffler. The guys run the gambit of some uniquely funny gay sexual situations and frustrations. From the first time that you had and enema before sex, daddy bears, bubble butts, poppers, bondage, and penis angst, just to name a few. You'll notice that the movie is not rated, but I would guess that it would be an NC17 due to a few scenes of male full frontal nudity. Overall, I would defeintly recommned this movie.. I'm still laughing and saying WTF."
5,"Wow, better than a concert","This is the most amazing concert video I've seen. Filmed in high-def at Maida Vale studio, London (where many Peel sessions were recorded) for TV and podcast. Very high quality surround sound, intimate closeups, *no studio audience* -- just bands playing music. The camerawork is like being on the stage -- it's better than seeing the bands in concert: most of these bands only perform in huge stadiums where even the best seats are far away, and tickets would cost many times the price of this disc.Some of the bands are more enigmatic than others. You can decide for yourself if they are your cup of tea. But even if you don't love Radiohead or the White Stripes, the performances are so intimate and involving that you will want to watch them repeatedly.If John Peel was still around this is what he'd be producing. Very highly recommended."
3,"Not a Gibson, but good value for money","This a good guitar. It is a shame it looks like and is called a Les Paul, which will immediatly force oyu to draw comparisons with the ""real thing"". For a 350 guitar, this is very good. They play nicely, look good, and probalby won't let you down. You won't be dissapointed if you got one of these. I've taken the time to undertake an extensive comparison of the Gibson and Epiphone Les Paul. You can see this at my website dub dub dub dot masht dot com. I hope this helps. To summarise, there IS a big difference in the tone, there IS a big different in teh aesthetics, and there IS a big difference in the build quality and the auality of the components. It is NOT the same thing made in a different place."
5,A lovely book,"The first in a series of seven, this book tells of a headstrong princess' rash action in the name of curiosity, and the consequences of that action. She no longer exists to her people, and must take on a new identity to begin her quest to right the great wrong that she has brought down onto the earth. She loses everyone and everything that she loves, and she must learn to face herself, as well as her fears.This is a lovely book that is well-worth seeking out."
4,Passing of a jazz legend,The two CD's are outstanding compilations of Brubeck's mastery of jazz. The DVD was just OK as I expected it to be footage of his trio and him playing in a concert setting.
5,My only Jazz album!,"Take Five has always been my favorite jazz piece. I purchased the CD just for that, but I like everything on it."
1,Negro music,"This album makes young, innocent women dance with lewd abandon. It represents the corruption of our nation by dirty Communists. Get this filth out of your homes."
1,"horrid,in every way imaginable,though the ending was intriguing(1.5/5)","(i have not seen the animated series this movie is based on,so i can't compare the two)this has to be one of the most awful films i have sen in the theatre in quite some time in all aspects.the acting was abysmal.the special effects were not so special.the dialogue was horrid as was the delivery.and don't get me started on the predictability.it's a real shame,because i think there was the potential for a good movie.this just wasn't it.the only decent part was the ending which was intriguing,and which definitely sets up a sequel.it's possible this film,despite horrid reviews,may make enough money for a second instalment,in which case it would be interesting to see where it goes ,and if it any improvements will be made.for me,The Last Airbender is a 1.5/5,because of the ending"
1,the last airbender..........I WISH!,"no i did not like this movie...........and i love fx movies...........i had hopes for this since the cartoon isn't to bad but, boy did they make a mess of this. I didn't think the story was layed out right.....and i won't even go into the editing, nor the scene that was cut from the movie but in the previews. to be fair my wife did like this. just thought that they did a poor job with it. and now since they made 1 million dollars on it i heard they will go forward with the second....so lets hope its alot better.............ALOT BETTER."
2,Very Boring!!!,"I never watched the Nickelodeon cartoon, and never cared to watch it, because I don't care for anime. The preview of this movie looked pretty good, but in my opinion, it was just plain boring. Maybe it was M. Night Shymalan's writing. The fire, earth, and water flying around got really old really fast. A kid named Aang is found frozen underwater. Katara and Sokka help him out, who come from the Southern Water Tribe. Zuko, the Prince of the Fire Nation comes to their village in search of the Avatar (Aang) Soon, there is a rebellion against the Fire Nation, and try to stop them from taking over the Kingdoms. I wouldn't recommend THE LAST AIRBENDER!!!"
1,"This should be the absolutely ""Last Airbender""",Waste of money and time. Not even worth a rental no matter what cost. They should pay you to watch. HORRIFIC!!!
4,Good Quality at a Good Price,"I purchased this ramp for my aging 11 year old Labrador who has been having difficulty jumping into the back seat of my truck. The ramp is easy to unfold and is light weight. It's also mounts easily and is of sturdy aluminum that I believe will hold up very well lasting indefinitely. It should be noted that this ramp mounts to the floor threshold of your vehicle, so I would only caution buyers to consider the elevation distance from the top of the ramp to the top of the your vehicle's seat. Be sure, that your pet can jump that distance or be assisted onto the seat itself once they reach the top of the ramp. Fortunately, my truck rear seats split in two and fold up independently, so my pet can walk up the ramp onto the truck floor and then jump onto the other seat. Then I can replace the folded seat in the down position. I mention this because the ramp can not be mounted to the top of the seat itself at least not for use with a truck."
1,Waste of Time,This movie had so much potential and it flopped big time. The film was sold to us in d and there was absolutely no effect with our without the glasses on. Most persons left the cinema disappointed.
1,Should have STUCK to the story!,"I could go on forever about picking this movie apart, but I will only say this. Had he stuck to the story and broke it up into a saga, he could have been rich beyond belief. As it were, he decided to mess it up by leaving out important characters like Suki, who has a huge part in the last book! Haru ended up being a very small part as well. Maybe next time he will learn not to mess up a good thing, but probably not."
1,It's a good thing he's the last airbender...,"This movie sucked. The original series that this movie is based off of has been one of my favorites for years. What M Night has done is butcher what was a good story. The only positive things that I can say about this movie is that the graphics are really good and the costumes are great. The negatives highly out weigh the positive, however. The actors can't even pronounce any of the names correctly, they cut out characters pivotal to to plot, montages were over used, the acting sucked, and there were times where it felt like a 1970's kung fu movie. Overall, do not waste your time with this pathetic excuse for a movie."
1,This movie was pathetic,"Forced emotion, robotic dialog, even the effects weren't that great. The animated series was better and I wasn't a fan of that either but my kids were. Glad I only rented it and didn't buy it."
1,movie pales next to animated series!!,"I saw Shyamalan's movie before watching the animated series. I thought it was okay. After watching the entire series, I now realize how disappointing and how horrible the movie is!!! It basically sucks! The characters were not portrayed properly, especially Aang and Sokka and so many key characters in book 1 were not included in the movie. I can't fathom how someone could think the movie was good after watching the animated series."
1,"nice fx, terrible otherwise","I've never seen the cartoon, but this film is just flat-out awful. It's one of only two movies I've ever walked out of mid-way through. ILM's special effects were great (I saw it in 2D, but heard that the fx get wrecked when seen in 3D), but otherwise, it was literally one of the worst half-movies I've ever seen in my life."
1,Worst?,"I have used this phrase lightly in the past, but this is not one of those cases: This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't want to think about it anymore."
3,Hope they make another one,"The movie was OK, the acting was a little dry but the effects were good. The effects were the only reason I kept watching it. I don't think it would make much sense to someone who hasn't seen the cartoon (Avatar:The last Airbender), there was a lot left out, which I did expect that because of the time issue. I would have like to have seen a little comedy from Aang and Sokka. Sokka makes one wise crack through the whole movie and that wasn't even funny.The ending does leave it open to having another movie made, I just hope they have enough fan base to actually get the next one made. I'm afraid it's going to be like Eragon and just leave you hanging without a real ending."
1,do NOT be fooled by the production description!,"PRODUCTION DESCRIPTION of the dvd ""Experience the thrilling live-action adventure based on the hit Nickelodeon series Avatar: The Last Airbender. Join Aang, an extraordinary boy with incredible ""bending"" powers, as he journeys through an exotic land filled with magical creatures and powerful friends. As the Avatar, he is the only one who can end the age-old conflict between the four nations: Air, Water, Earth and Fire. An inspirational journey, The Last Airbender is exciting entertainment for the entire family!""come on! with all the negative reviews on the movie - for sure, if there is a SUB-ZERO RATINGS .... many ardent fans of the animated series would have voted SUB-ZERO. to pay the price of $26.99 to own this 'monstrosity'? NOT!Get the completed animated series, BOOK 1- BOOK 3, instead!"
1,Sad,"Normally I would just say rent it for a $1 at the grocery store, but even this I would recommend save your dollar. It was poorly done and does not do justice to the cartoon."
1,"Dismal on it's own, a tragedy to fans of the Show","What can Shyamalan have been thinking?I can stand a terrible, cheesy movie. This trying so hard, and was the more miserable for it. Poor acting by most (some exceptions), bad planning, THE WORST SCRIPT EVER."
1,Just Awefull.,First the story line didn't follow the original story line ( like it should have) very well. The casting was just awefull excpetially monk giatsko. Third the ending was awefull I was at least hoping for him to turn into a cat fish monster but no. That's to much to ask so ( spoiler alert) he makes a big wave that scares away all the fire nation ships. Over all the movie was a bust that could have been a thousand times better.
1,dissapointed,This is my sons absolute favorite cartoon but the movie did not meet our expectations. The movie only covers a small portion of the avatar series. Also the characters do NOT seem to portray the cartoon which is what we loce about the series.
1,what a piece of crap,"MKS has got to be the worst director of all time. He's basically a one trick pony that's already done his one trick and now should be put out to pasture. I've watched the series and was excited from the previews but I couldn't make it 5 minutes into the movie without getting upset at how the movie betrayed it's roots.I would give this a zero star if that were possible.If your a fan of the series, don't waste your time and I hope MKS stop directing and bastardizing good concepts. If he ruins his own crappy ideas then who cares."
1,Disappointed,"This movie was the biggest left down, after a fantastic TV series. This film had cheap effects and horrible action scenes (like that of the cheap old kung-fu movies), and little bending (the bending in the movie required a dance every time even for to throw a little stone) ... The benders are all lame and the story sucked (they go here and there but and then are at the North pole)... they got almost nothing right in the movie... they cant even pronounce names correctly"
1,Disappointing,"My 10 year old son and I were really looking forward to this movie coming out. We watched the whole animated series over the summer and LOVED it. We couldnt wait for the movie. When we saw it in the theatres we were so disappointed! There were several parts that were completely different from the original series, like the ending water battle. Also they dont go from town to town driving out firebenders. The animated series allowed you to connect with the characters and it was humorous and engaging. The movie was a let down for us."
1,Just a really silly movie,"I didn't finish watching this movie as it went nowhere. At least, I expected it to have cool action and maybe represent some of the awesome visuals created by the show but it didn't. Dev Patel was interesting in it and I liked his character twists, but the rest of the movie was barely coherent and I feel that if I didn't know who was who before I watched it, I would have no idea what was going on. Watch the original animated show!!"
3,I liked it.,Have never seen the cartoon but thanks to the movie now I plan to do it. I thought the special effects were fantastic. Yes it could have been a better movie but I have rented far worse that has left me angry as to why they even make those kind of movies. Finished and thought that it was better than what I heard and hope they make a sequel.
1,No,"Tv show way #%#@$% better! Don't understand how a good anime could become a terrible flop. No, I doDirected by Shamalan, also known for signs and the happening balh!Terrible child actors, some good moments but for the most part just blah!Too short didn't have time to develop any story unlike tv series. (Not like anyone's complaining to see it hurry up and end.)In the show they had quick motions to produce large-scale bending; here they dance around and do ""air-karate"" to make a simple flame or rock float, little action moments just poor and simple dialogue (with so much narration as if its a documentary)Don't waste money on the film, even if you're interested in seeing how bad it is. That was what I did and it was a waste of my time.Instead I would recommend checking out the anime series if you haven't already it's so much better."
2,Save your monry on the 3D version,"Recently purchased my 3D flatscreen & have been able to collect and watch seven 3D movies. Am impressed! As excited as I was with my first color TV. The movies are spectacular in 3D, and a couple surpass their theatrical presentations. However, my entusiasm has been tempered with the recent release of The Last Airbender. Although the reviews for the movie havn't been that great, I expected to enjoy the special effects in 3D. Wrong! There is depth perception in some scenes, but that's it. Can be watched without glasses with little or no distortion. Is this the future of 3D blu ray, with studios attempting to cash in with movies not suited for the format in order to provide an impressive array of software? Hope not. I""m willing to wait a month or six for the next 3D release, as long as it's as good as the early ones."
1,If you can't EVEN get the pronunciation of the main character right...,"...after watching 3 seasons of it (like as in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE), then you really don't deserve to call yourself a director. And should apologize for wasting our time. And give us a refund. And promise to NEVER touch this storyline again! And...ice cream.It's deplorable. The acting was soooo bad, it was like watching a traffic accident. You're remorsefully shocked, and want it to go away (or get up and leave, but can't, since your kids were with you). The writing was awful. The Directing (as I mentioned), unbelievably unfathomably...sucked. ""Sucked"" as in ""Oh, my God....I,me, yes me, could have done better! No wait, my five year old could have. With his eyes closed. And while running a fever.""His unforgivable mistakes, especially in casting and then OK'ing the storyline, were what amateur directors do...not a seasoned veteran.I hated it. It sucked. Go watch the original show."
1,this was just painful to watch,"I absolutely loved the cartoon. This movie made me sad. And not in the way that it moved me. This movie could have been, should have been so much better. First there should have been way more cg. The movie really sucked without it. Or the cg just sucked so bad it should have never have been attempted. The dialogue was ridiculous. The kids were not believable in any sense of the word. I gotta come back to the cg one more time it just angers me so much all those body movements to bend the elements with very little effect was just horrible. Whoever put together this movie should never be let near a movie again. Ever! I like the idea of an avatar movie but one that doesn't look like it was put together by a tard. Do yourself a favor and bypass this one."
5,Defending the Last Airbender,"I absolutely loved the movie! I believe that many are being to harsh on the movie. It was meant to be a lighthearted family movie and not to be taken that seriously. I thought the movie was an excellent reproduction of the tv series. I thought all of the actors did a good job expecially Noah Ringer. It was also a very well directed movie. In my opinion, the movie was amazing with the special effects in 3D. Overall I thought it was a great success."
1,Boooo,"*spoilers*I went and saw this at the movies, as i was buying my ticket the ticket person told me that it was a bad movie. I agree, this movey is got very little in common with the cartoon, names are diffrent on main people. It's all spelled just enough not to void copyright law it seems. The earth kingdom is a village, the avatar can not kill anyone for its forbiden and to scare off the fire nation fleet at the north poll he raises a huge wall of water.... and.... sets it back down killing no one. YAWN"
4,Nice movie,"The movie has everything a bluray movie must have, and looks amazing...! it was a gift, and the reciever was SO excited that we had to see the movie right away..."
2,A Big Expectacle of CGI,"If all you love is CGI then this is the movie for you, cause there's a lot of it and it looks really good for the most part. On the other hand if a good story and acting is you forte then you'll probably be disappointed like I was. I have to say not having seen the cartoon Airbender in Nicktoon really helped me finished this movie simply because I had nothing to compare it with but now that I have managed to see a couple of season of it I have to say what a waste of time that movie was. First of all the main character's acting is so terrible I couldn't bear to listen anymore, throw in some one liners and cheese acting by some of the other cast members and you have a hell of a ride. I just hope that if they decide to do a sequel it may be a worthwhile one. I didn't loved it nor did I hate it I just watched it once and was gone with it."
1,Very disappointing,Knowing that this was targeted for a young audience it was still a huge disappointment. At their best the special effects were mildly impressive and other times they just looked terribly low budget. The dialogue and the plot were horrible. It isn't even worth the rental price. You will be especially disappointed if you know anything about the series.
3,Nothing special,"I wouldn't go so far as the other reviewers here in givingThe Last Airbenderjust one star. For a comic-book action movie, it's entertaining and has some beautiful locales. Still, it's a pretty unoriginal film. The acting seems almost amateurish, perhaps inevitable given that most of the actors are in their teens. However, ultimatelyThe Last Airbenderjust comes across as a pale shadow of Lord of the Rings. The fighting isn't anywhere near as dramatic or emotionally powerful. With M. Night Shyamalan, it's a bit surprising the movie doesn't have a more distinct personality."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is just horrible. Whether you watch the cartoon like I did, or never seen it before, this is just horrible."
3,Diverse casting is a good thing... when the story warrants it.,"For anyone using the fallback of ""choosing the best actors for the roles"" with regards to the casting, I have to wonder if you would use that same argument in a film based on, say, slavery or what have you. Yes, diverse casting is always a good thing. WHEN the story warrants it. I was and remain shocked and disappointed by the casting choices in this film, but it is what it is.As for the movie itself, it can work for those who have never seen the series or completely block out all knowledge of the series before viewing. It does what Hollywood typically does to movies of this nature, so I anticipated that going in. Still, this could have been better. I'm usually not all that impressed by MNS's films anyway, so at least this was right on par with my expectations.Still, overall it's light years better than Dragonball. I suppose that's saying something. Perhaps."
1,The worst movie ever,"I love the show, its my all time favorite, but they ruined it.CON'S:1. they pronounced Aang's name Ong (how does that happen?)2. the fire nation was all Indian (racist)3. they left so much out it was hard to follow, even for those of us who have seen the series.4. uncle was a chubby, laughable, wise, white haired character in the series, however in the movie he was a skinny man, with black dread locks, and serious all the time.5.the fire-benders could not make their own fire they could only control the fire they bring or find.Those are just a few reasons why I despise this movie.PRO'S1.Its a movie YAY (well if you count ruining a TV series, and disillusioning an entire world audience a pro)"
2,Great potential - REALLY poor execution,"This movie was bad. All the makings of a good movie were there (karate stuff, special effects, decent background), but it just didn't work together. It just felt amateurish to me from the first scene, and just got more painful over time. No real character development, and the poor acting in general kept me from really getting into this.So close."
3,bad luck brodstreet,OMGGG!!!!!!!!!!! This is not like the cartoons ! I dont get it why only water it makes no sense at all!Socka did not even say a joke.Aang to Ahung. WHARE ARE THE KEOSHI WARIORS? There is wayy more to complain about but thats it for today.
2,If you haven't seen the series you might enjoy this,but there was too much action crammed into one movie. Character and plot development really suffered because of this.The visuals are amazing. The acting is average.I fell sound asleep. My children (ages 11 - 17) all thought that this movie fell far short of the series and (other than the visual effects) was weak in general. Thank goodness we only rented it from Redbox and didn't buy it!
1,Worthless in every respect,"If you have any love for the animated series produced by Nickelodeon then you will find nothing to love in this movie. If you have any love for cinema at all you will find nothing to love about this movie. I could take the time to single out something but i don't see the point, it's BAD everything... writing, direction, visuals, acting, all of it is just bad.However, if you love the animated series and love to yell at bad movies while drunk this could be the picture for you. Just be prepared to be heartbroken."
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad start to the Airbender series, although it looks like there won't be anymore. For those who like the TV show, there are aspects that will irritate. Overall not a bad kids movie."
2,waste of time,"this movie was filled with such terrible everything. whether you have seen the tv series or not, this was garbage. it took them like 12 karate moves to bend a ball of water. why bother if it takes 5 minutes?! dont waste your time with this movie. i gave it 2 stars because despite it being awful, it is watchable (particularly for young-ish children)"
5,My kids favorite,My kids have watch this movie when it was free under our Amazon Prime account and when I had to pay for it. The creator of the sound and effects did a really great job making all scenes to look real. I will recommend it for all ages.
3,Airbender,"Acting is horrible but I still like the movie. (Key word is like) the ""action"" was decent and the cinematography was very good."
5,Loved It!!!,Ive seen the series and im a big fan. I feel like people are dissing this movie too much. The second one shold be better. We just need to give it a chance. I thought the film was great and exilirating. :)
5,the last airbender,"I saw this movie & loved it!! I went back to see it four times..I have a martial arts back ground & the movements was so beautiful to watch, especially at the end with the ocean. I sure wish they would do the second book, Earth bending. But with so many negative reviews, I guess that will not happen. I have seen all the cartoons & it follows the books exactly."
1,whats going on,"all i have to say is that this movie kinda reminds me of dragon ball. they screwed that show up like i have never seen before. i understand why he change some things. this show is nothing like the tv serious. if he was smart he would of done book by book. he change the firebender being limit to how much they could use. why is that i tell you why because he does not know nothing about the show. i heard cause the other benders are limit to when they can use there bending. thats not true cause airbenders can use it any where. so can waterbenders but there are some places they could not ""one place thati know"". the only ones were earthbenders there bending anywhere. dont waste your time if you seen the show."
5,Super awesome movie,Super awesome movie was super awesome. And In this super awesome movie that I need to add a review for I wrote enough words to meet the minimum standards and requirements set forth by amazon.com. Good Job Amazon.
5,My Favorite Movie,"Absolutely the best in special effects and computer generated imagery. Special effects are photo realistic and cannot be distinguished from make believe. The story is mystical and of spiritual significance which is quite refreshing in this material world. The actors portrayed their characters well. Kudos to the director M. Knight Shyamalam. I was so impressed, I saw this movie over 20 times in the theater. Good thing my daughter was the theater manager. I look forward to the sequel."
1,Don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time watching this movie. How can the director change the name of the main character?!?! The fight scenes are just terrible. I could go on and on as to how terrible this movie is. Overall, this movie should be remake using a martial arts director like Ang Lee.The only positive to this movie, the costumes."
1,DO NOT waste your time with this one!!,"What a piece of pure garbage...just watch the cartoon! It was impossible for this guy to cram a whole season in 1 movie. There are so many subplots left out that you really get confused on what the hell is going on. The movie has horrible actors, a broken story-line & minimal CGI effects. If you see the cartoon, you'll be a ble to tell how the director rushed this production. Do not waste your time and money on this one folks!!"
1,Sucked! Totally ripped off! About one infinitith of a star!,"This movie really sucked! At the end of the movie, I felt like I was slapped in the face by Jon Cena. Then it gets worse, I wasted 3 more bucks on 3D, which was suckish, because no one tried to scare you with a threat for a face injury. This is M. Night Shaylaman's worst work! Also, couldn't they just call it : The Last Airbender : Book One? I thought they were going to cram the whole T.V. series in there! That means ripoff x 6! Dude, this movie makes Pirhanas 3D look like Avatar (the other one)! The T.V. series looked great! In fact, I was just going to buy the whole series when I found out the movie was coming out , which could save a lot of money on DVD. Plus, there's mispronounciation of the name Aang. This movie is the new ""Longest And Most Meaningless Movie Ever Made!"""
1,MINUS 1 STAR! PERIOD!,"we have watched the animation series AVATAR Book 1 again to PURGE out the stupid movie version. if the ratings has zero or even minus ratings ... would have given it a minus ONE or worst. for those who have not watch the animation series yet, PLEASE get the complete series: BOOK 1 to BOOK 3. can't imagine the ORIGINAL writers, creators, producers of this amazing animation series let shyamalan massacred the movie. all the screen actors are total TRAINWRECK, cannot come close to those VOICE ACTORS in the animation. the VOICE ACTORS are brilliant! we echoed ALL the 1-star reviewers ... we watched the complete series and after the final Book 3, were actually talking about how the real-life version would be. man, what a HEARTACHE. truly this summer biggest disappointment. we are re-visiting the whole series to rid us of the awful images of the movie.- the carpenters boys"
5,No expectations.,"I purchased the DVD without any expectations and wasn't disappointed. Not knowing anything about the series helped. It was an enjoyable fantasy escape; after all that is why I watch movies, to escape not to rip them apart. It wasn't the best acting and the dialog wasn't the most natural but it made me forget the real world for a while. At 65 there is a lot to forget."
1,I expected more,"I expected more, after seeing the other movies M. Night Shyamalan, I expected a good movie, but this is terrible. The only good thing that movie was the price."
1,Huh?,"My kids and I love the cartoon and this movie was supposedly based on the cartoon. But if that was the case, WHY would you change the pronunciation of the MAIN characters name??? It was very confusing to a 5 year old. And that was just the beginning. I know it would be difficult to adapt 3 seasons to the big screen, but I swear whoever wrote this didn't even watch the cartoon.So, in conclusion, if you LOVE the cartoon, you will probably not like the movie. On it's own, if you have never seen a single cartoon, then you might like it for the action, but that's about it."
5,3D is stunning,"The director captured the essence of book 1 of Avatar, Water. The 3d is very good. Waiting for the other books."
3,Don't expect it to be like the cartoon but not a bad kids movie,"If you are a big Avatar fan like me, and you are expecting this to be like the lord of the rings movies that really pay homage to a great series then you will be disappointed. I had read the reviews before watching this movie and therefor had a adjusted expectation, witch helped me to like the movie just for being a decent movie, not to hope for a true movie of the avatar cartoons. I do think it is a wast to have not stuck to the plan for M. Night Shyamalan, who failed at lady in the water and wanted to redeem himself. He should have known better then to take something with a cult following and not stay close to the original. Watch the movie with your kids but if you don't have kids and are only looking to see the movie version of the nick series... skip it."
2,hollywood does it again...,"how in the world do you get air bender wrong? the anime is all ready there for you to copy. what else do u need?!i was watching the makeup trailer they have on this site, and i feel bad for all the actors and costume designers and everybody body that worked so hard on the movie only to have it pissed on by god knows who. the opening credits does say the m. night wrote, directed and produced it so...yea.."
1,The Last Airbender,The package does not tell you this is the first in the series. You expect the entire saga and get book 1 water instead-very misleading. Special effects were so-so. I expected more views of the avatar state and got watered down version. The gag reel was better than the movie. AANG's name mispronounced. The persons who did the editing for the movie script obviously did not watch any of the series. Very abridged version.
3,Beautiful pictures + Interesting special effects + The acting and the plot are suitable only for kids. There is no depth.,"- The picture is beautiful. The are some interesting special effects.- The acting and the plot are suitable only for kids. There is no depth.I have not watched the animation version. So, I can't compare them."
1,"TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, BLAND MOVIE","I don't ever write reviews, but after seeing this movie I felt compeled to voice my disappointment. I am a big fan of the animated series. In the animated series the characters are funny, serious, and powerful. The movie is the exact opposite characters are very one dimensional and there was no humor in their preformances. Also everything is pronounced differently which is just annoying if you have ever seen the cartoon. This movie felt very forced and awkward. I didn't like anything about it and I will never see a movie directed by M. Night again. This is the worst adaptation I have ever seen."
1,50.00 bucks???,I just bought a vizio 3D TV. I'm not impressed with 3D TV. Paying 50 for a 3D vid. seems absurd? I wish I could throw money away like that! Must be nice.
4,cute movie!,now - i never really watched the cartoon series - i'd catch a few episodes here and there...from what i understand - those who followed the series didn't enjoy the movie as much. i really enjoyed it. i think the main actor rocked the screen with his performance - i don't know where they found this little guy - but he was awesome! very cute movie - i enjoyed it! worth the rental!
1,For sure I am skipping any sequels,"This has to be one of the worst family movies I have ever seen. For sure it is the worst movie based of a comic book movie. Maybe its because I do not appreciate the action, or the story. I have heard from fans of the comic book that it accurately follows the plot of the comics. If true, I will not be reading the comic books. First of, the very concept of people who can, by doing kung fu moves, manipulate the four elements; earth, fire, air and water, just looks ridiculous on screen. Yes, the Jedi Knights in the Star Wars movies could do similar things, but at least it looked natural there, as if the Jedi is reaching out beyond their bodies to do it. Here, it just looks stupid. And then the casting was way off. There are characters played by Indians that have Chinese names, which was wholly unbelievable. Overall, a bad movie."
3,Typical for this director,This was ok in the action but the story should have had an ending. When the movie ended it still had a lot of holes and was a little disapointing. If you like to watch movies that really don't have an ending then this is for you.
1,IF ONLY THERE WAS A ZERO RATING!!!,"I give M. Night a ZERO rating - for his zero respect of the storyline created by the originators of this amazing series that I watched with my nieces and nephews, for his zero understanding of the clearly defined characters that he gutted so completely, for wasting $150 million on pathetic special effects when amazing tech was available to him. His original material hasn't been interesting since his first and only decent film - why give him incredible material to ruin? Thank goodness I didn't have to pay to see this (friend's house)."
2,Shamamalamylan strikes again! Hahaha.,"Speilberg could've made this movie incredible but instead we got sorry Shamalamalalalaaalaman to do it. They were doomed from the start. I'm a big fan of the TV series to the point where I pretty much know the dialogue by heart. To take such a wonderful story, strip away everything good about it in an attempt to sell tickets on 3D effects alone is just disgraceful. It sucked in the theatre but wasn't as sucky seeing it a second time online but still horrible. I'm only giving it two stars because a few things they actually got right: the fire nation ships, costumes, the landscape of the southern and nothern water tribes, a handful of bending scenes, the casting of Aang, Katara, Sokka and Princess Uwei wasn't bad but everyone else was out of place. Save your money, watch the cartoon. You'll love it!:)"
1,I've been angry for months about this movie,"My brother convinced me to watch the cartoon this summer and I loved it. The TV show is pretty perfect; story, character, intrigue, complexity, it's all there. We have a friend who took us to see the movie and even though we didn't pay a cent, by the end we were contemplating hunting down M. Knight and demanding a refund for all of the American peoples. Not only were there unnecessary cuts, as other reviewers have elaborated on, there were really stupid and unnecessary changes from the story all the way down to name pronunciations. And what's really tragic, those cuts and changes didn't make the story new or more accessible to new viewers, they sucked the life out of an amazing show. Really, this movie is an empty corpse of the truly innovative and entertaining show.Don't buy the movie."
1,My Last Hope for M. Night Shyamalan...,"Let's keep this kind of short. The movie was horrible. If you watched the series then watched the movie, you would have hated the film. If you did not watch the series and just watched the film...you would have been completely lost and STILL would have hated the film. The film was badly written and had very bad acting --I'm sorry to say since I liked some of the actors in it. They supposedly spent all the money on special effects...could have fooled me.This was my last hope for a decent M. Night Shyamalan movie and it failed...miserably. I don't even think kids liked it very much. Complete FAIL."
1,Save your money and your time. Avoid this movie.,"This movie is absolutely aweful. If you want a more detailed review of why, there are plenty of good ones out there. And I support those reviews."
2,Disappointing!!!,"Disappointing!The movie promises sooo much when one reads about the movie, when one sees the preview BUT watching the whole movie I was very disappointed -Lots of effects but that is it - it is a movie one watches BUT will not watch again....not worth buying, not worth keeping! if one wants to see it ONLY AS A RENTAL!!!Therefore VERY DISAPPOINTING."
1,Disappointment,"The Nickelodeon cartoon series was absolutely amazing. The story principal was well thought out and the characters were people you really cared about, that faced problems and overcame them, becoming stronger.The movie based on those stories is a HUGE disappointment. It failed to capture the essence of the characters and took maybe three or four points along the first season's story line and tried to cram it into one story. The dialog has to work overtime to make up for not showing what happened, and is therefore weak and repetitive. There is barely enough time to understand the journey that the characters are going to take, and then it's over.The special feature interview with the creators of the cartoon is the only thing worth watching on the dvd."
1,Trash,"total trash. nothing like the TV show. salkdj asdk jfsdk h lksdlfkd j flksdlk lj jfsdskf ij lij aslkfse jlj flkjdhf i hfjshflkjh f kjf kjh kjhhf iu eui uhhd wn sd iuenfnv sdjfn s efjnfduhas nsdkj fd kjsb kjshdf wkjh sdkuh ewkhujf jsdfiushff kjh fshfsisu kjh hflsku faskjfas akuh alkjhf asi ulkj hfifrlksdf iu!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT IS HOW BAD IT WAS!!!! AND HOW MUCH SENSE IT MADE COMPARED TO THE SHOW. even as a movie it fails, the acting was awful."
2,What 3d ?,"If this is the only 3d movie you have to watch on your new 3d tv, you will be very disappointed . Nothing jumped out of the screen and I thought something was wrong with my set up.. I would not recommend this movie in 3d or 2d . I can't believe the movie studios are dragging their feet on releasing better 3d movies in time for the busiest retail season of the year .. Why are they taking so long to put out 3d blu ray movies. This is going to hurt the sale of the 3d tv's for the Christmas season if there is only a limited selection of movies to watch.."
1,Terrible Movie,Don't bother watching this movie. You will waste precious time from your life. Shamalan totally ruined this and he should be ashamed of himself for directing such crap.
1,Where to start.....?,"This is the worst movie ever! It had so much potential and then M.N.S. came along and ruined it all. I feel that the creators of the cartoon series were the obvious choice for directing and writing the script. If I were them I would be super angry at M.N.S. for destroying this wonderful story, and at Nickelodeon for okaying this crap."
1,Another Shyamalan Slaughter Movie!?!?!,"Shyamalan has completely killed, mutilated and dismembered this movie and franchise! Airbender has an awesome story line, and as some have pointed, at times is jokingly funny, this movie is neither! The best movie Shyamalan directed was The Six Sense, with Bruce Willis, all his movies have been going down hill ever since. How may more bad movies does this guy have to Direct and Produce before somebody puts a stop to this? The reason this movie deserves Zero Stars:Cons:- Rushed Storyline (entire movie felt crammed and rushed)- Horrible Acting (not even the special effects could camoflage that)- Bad Choice of Actors (none were believable playing their rolls)- Bad Choice of Director (Shyamalan)- And the list goes on... and on... and on...Pros:- The title of the movie; thats about it."
1,"Skip this, watch the Anime series",The Anime gave you amazing character buildup and it was a show adults could enjoy. This movie belongs in Mystery Science Theatre 3000.We need a REAL director to step in and re-do this movie. M. Night Shymalan should be ashamed.We need Guillermo Del Torro and Peter Jackson to come in and save this.For Now STICK TO THE ANIME ONLY!!!
1,"So much potential, and even more disappointment","Its really sad that this movie turned out as bad as it did, Avatar the last airbender would have been an AWESOME movie, but somehow. This movie turned out HORRIBLE, and I just cannot understand, why did they make it so terrible? I just dont understand"
1,This deserve a big fat ZERO.,"If you haven't seen the cartoon series you will surely be disgusted with this movie. The pacing is all over the place, the minute you think ok this might turn out good and in a blink of an eye you're off to another plot point. wait sorry this movie has no defined plot. Now if you are one of the avid fans of the cartoon series then yes you will surely and absolutely be DISGUSTED with this film. From the interviews you would think the director (aka the Hack) would be caring to make sure it stays true to the story and characters of the series. Nothing to recreate here the story and characters are well thought out from the series but no the hack has to put his trademark style in the movie and voila the biggest disaster of a movie. You need to demand to be payed to watch this movie. I'm so sorry to put a 1 star on this review only because its required."
1,Unspeakably Bad Movie,This movie was so bad on so many levels it's hard to know where to begin. This is movie making ineptitude on a staggering scale.
1,A horrible disgrace to the name Avatar,Worst representaion of the cartoon possible. M. Night Shamylan should be ashamed of his humiliating film. I'm a huge fan of Avatar: the Last Airbender and this movie was bad that I wanted to scream and cry at the same time because he ruined it so horrifically. Don't support atrocious film-makers by not buying this movie. This movie will only bring grief to any true Avatar fan.
2,What was that!,i had realy wanted to see the Last Airbender since I had seen the Cartoon. Can I say what a Disgrace! i went to see it the day it came out and was excited and walked out dissappoited. Half of the book one was left out and it ended with book one. the action was good and so was the special effacts. if you have seen the cartoon please don't see this movie.
1,Can't believe anyone would rate it above 1 star!,"Not to go on and on....but this movie was absolutely horrible! The 3-D wasn't even 3-D; the actors were mediocre (except for the guy who played Prince Zuko). How could such an awesome series end up so disastrous? Luckily we caught a matinee, and I don't feel like a total fool spending hard earned money on this flop."
1,Wasted Effort,"I love this series and couldn't wait for the real live action, but like many others whose off the screen series tries it's way on the big screen was a wasted effort. Nice try M.night Shyamalan but this was a straight to the dvd film. I couldn't believe the horrendous screenplay, I never finished watching it. Trying to fit a whole season of series into less than a 2hr film is one short of a miracle. Some cast members needed to be recasted and the screenplay needs to go back where it came from. Until a better version is due to be released if and in the future, I will stick with the animation."
1,Excruciating Disappointment,"This could have been a wonderful movie. Avater The Last Airbender is a great show, and I am a huge fan. When this movie came out, all of my friends and I went out to see the midnight showing. It was a terrible disappointment. Honestly, everyone walking out of that theater was either too let down to say anything or cursing M. Night. Shymalan for ruining the movie that has been looked forward to for so long. Do not waste your money; this is a terrible movie and an insult to the real show."
1,Horrendous,"Piss-poor, even for an adaptation.If you're a fan of the series, don't bother. If you're curious about the series and were thinking the movie will be a good intro, don't bother.If you wanna get drunk with friends and tear into a bad movie, by all means get this from the RedBox."
1,True Disappointment!!!!!,"I am a big M. Knight fan. Like most, I was excited to hear about the movie coming out. Then I heard about the casting.... Well maybe it will be alright since it's a M. Knight film. If you are a true Avatar fan, do not waste your time with this movie. If you never watched the series, them you will probably enjoy the movie.Personally I was pissed off with it. He changed the names of the character, why? It's not like they were hard names to pronouce. The bending took foreeeeevvvvver!!!! By the time they actually do bending, the other person could take them out. Why change the personallities of the characters. That's why you fell in love with show. Long story short, I hated the movie! I hope if they continue making the movies they get someone else to do it!"
4,Good Movie,"So as we all know, there has been many different things said about this movie. I, being a fan of the cartoon of which this was based off of, wanted to see it. I did and I liked it, mostly. There was one thing that really made me ticked though, and they were the fact of how the names were pronounced. Why couldn't they have just said the same names as in the show? Anyways, I thought that the over all acting was pretty good and that the fight sequences were also pretty good.If you have never seen the show, then see this movie. It is worth the watch. Also, if you have still yet to watch the television series that this was based off of, then go out and buy it this instance because you have no idea what you are missing out on! This is a review coming from the thoughts of an Avatar: The Last Airbender fan."
1,the last airbender,This is NOT authorised to playback in this area. It is useless to me as i cannot view the dvd.there fore i cannot give any opinion.
2,Unspeakbly dull...,"The source material was lame, but I hoped the action sequences would make up for it. Sadly, no such luck.One wonders why you don't use a gun and shoot the ""benders"" while they take their 45 seconds to ready whatever attack it is. Can you say ""sniper"" or ""carpet bomb""? I knew you could.Seriously - take a pass."
5,Just a thought,"Loved it! Yes there were a lot of stuff cut out of the movie that they had in the cartoon and yes some of the acting was a bit off but it was a great movie and it tells a great story. M. Night was damned if he did and damned if he didnt. Dont base wether you are going to see this movie or not bc you hate M. Nights movies, he didnt even write it! He made this movie from a cartoon series something he has never done before. You need to see it to make your own opinion but i loved it and will be purchasing the DVD."
1,dont do it,If M Night was smart he could had have this spread out into 7 to 8 movies like the Harry Potter films. NOOOOOO he crammed it all in one! Tey were pronouncing the lead characters name wrong!!! That erked me so bad that i wanted to get up and walk out the movie. Do not waste your money. Watch the cartoon which is AWESOME.
1,Don't waste your money,"Saw this at the theater and was disappointed to say the least. Should have asked for my money back, it was that bad."
1,Horrible interpretation...,I'm not an avid viewer of the animated version but I saw just enough to get some context. The obvious complaint as most of you have already heard is why the change in the character's race? Usually Hollywood does this to include A-list actors in their films. Puzzling. The script was predictably campy and childish just like the show. I've yet to see a decent movie from M.Night since Six Sense.
1,Absolute garbage!,"That's right, this movie is absolute garbage. From start to finish: crap. I can't tell you how many people I've told to avoid this (not just for the racist casting choices) who've gone to seen it in theaters only to come back and tell me: ""You were right! Why didn't I listen to you?""Seeing all of MNS's movies I can say that is is definitely his worst. That is, if he doesn't come out with another movie that tops the crap that is The Last Airbender. The only way I would recommend watching this movie would be if there is a RiffTrax version in the future.Avoid at all cost."
1,Boring. Save your money,We were excited for this movie to come out and quickly purchased it (prior to reading reviews I am sorry to say). DULL! BAD ACTING! No coherent plot. Great idea gone very very wrong. Even my kids (who had really wanted this movie!!) said it was bad and then wanted to trade it at the used DVD store for something else. Not even worth a second watch for them and that is saying a lot.
4,The Last Airbender,"Having no connection to the series that this movie springs from, I think I can give a more objective view of this movie as exactly what it is...a movie. Anyway, I will start by saying I found the acting to be a bit mediocre, but overall enjoyed the plot. The ""bending"" feature of this movie was so beautiful, like a very skilled dance and I enjoyed that element. I also enjoyed the effects and scenery. I guess I would qualify it as a very ""artsy"" movie...The only downside I saw with it is that it does have a ""spirit"" world and is kinda new-ageish in that respect so people that don't believe in that element may not want to sit through a bunch of mystical ""spirits"" bologna."
4,seriously,Ok seriously people it was one person's interpretation of how he imagined that a live action movie should be. Granted I understand that many people had expectations and all but come on already . No I haven't seen the cartoon version and I do agree at least the names should have been pronounced properly butin the end it was like I said it was one imagining of events. I think it was a great movie all in all with great effects and fight scenes M.Night is a brilliant writer and director.
2,Unexplored potential,"As a fan of the Nick series Avatar: The Last Airbender, I was utterly disappointed by the melancholy attitude of the entire film. The special effects were worth the two stars, but there was absolutely no humor in the movie. I felt that the depth of each character was paper thin. They missed several key plot points for Book 1: Water as well. I understand that you can fit only so much subject material from a season into a feature length movie, but I felt they didn't even try. If they decide to follow up with books 2 and 3, I sincerely hope that it is written differently. They have great source material, so this shouldn't even be an issue."
3,A Promising Start,"After reading all of these reviews, I was incredibly skeptical about watching this movie. I had decided that any attempt to watch it would only make me upset, so I had tried to steer away from it. My son wanted to watch it, so I decided to watch it. I believed the worst in this movie. I came with the opinion that this movie would be horrible.Now there were many things I wasn't fond of, like the almost dance-like moves to bend, and the pronunciation of Aang's name (Aong???) it wasn't a horrible movie, and turned out pretty good.PROS: The graphics were nice, and pleasing to the eyes. The costumes were very good, and the explaination of the Avatar was very good.CONS: Not much is actually seen of the Avatar... The Avatar State goes into affect, but he kinda looks like a punk. The Fire Alliance ships were not pushed back, but obliterated...Overall, not bad...But not Great... Hopefully, Book Two will be better... And if they make Toph a boy... I'm done... LOL"
2,Wasn't what I'd hoped.,The movie was so poorly acted and I'm no critic. I like almost everything but this left me wanting. Some of the Special FX were ok but I've seen much better in less expensive movies.
3,Misunderstood,"Misinterpretation. When any content gets turned into a film, I believe it is hard to see it for what it is. M. Night Shyamalan did what he could with content, over an epic series first season, and turned it into a decent film. It flows, it makes its points, though to Avatar fans, it is sacrilegious content. It works as a film. The failing of this film might be the special effects, in that they could hit a little harder at points, and emotional points in the film are very middle ground. It is not Dragonball Evolution or that other video game film with fighters in it. Those movies, though one was Raul Julia's last, were easily some of the worst interpretations created. Last Airbender is not. It serves it's purpose and here's home for a sequel."
1,Its bayad mmmmmkay,"To be completely honest, this was terrible, and M Night Shamamalamma should not be allowed anywhere near anything that is good in its original form, as a fan of the actual show, and as someone who has seen allot of movies I can say with complete and total(ly justified) bias that this piece of crap should be destroyed, dont stream it for free, and do not buy it. just watch the actual show, and read it. the characters in this are completely wrong, names are wrong, and how they act is wrong. the soundtrack was not great either. The cinematography was okay I guess, but not good enough to redeem it."
2,Compared to the show it is no good,I was expecting a good movie due to the fact that I am a big fan of the show. But it did not follow the same story line or even plot. The movie is ok. But it has lots of bad acting and again does not simulate the show in which it was based on.
1,Shattered love for an amazing cartoon series.,"This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. I could go on for paragraphs describing in detail why it was so bad but, I'll try to keep it brief. My main issue was that it didn't stick to the show at all. For example, the characters from the movie were nothing like the characters from the show. Their attitudes and mannerisms had changed, along with some of their names. They also left out key elements that shaped the story and replaced them with trivial instances. The acting was ok. For the roles they were playing, the actors did a somewhat decent job but they could have researched the parts a little better. Overall, I was heartbroken by this piece of trash and because of this, I have made it my life goal to get M Night blacklisted in the film making community."
1,Disaster,"This movie was a disaster, it does nothing for the original animated series. After hearing that the cast were white, and the fact that it was directed my Shyamalan I should have known better to not even watch it."
1,Terrible movie,"This movie is horrible.It is impossible to take all the sub plots and character developments from a full season and place them in a 2 hour movie. It also suffers from child actors that deliver their lines with dull and wooden expressions. I felt like someone was just reading me the screenplay there is so much narration in this movie. Not even for complex story points, but very simple ones. You don't have to tell me that the boy is going to fall for the cute girl. What a crutch. Also the ending moves so far away from the series it is laughable. With out giving to much away. Not for the movie, but so I don't ruin the ending of season 1 for you since I highly recommend that one. **spoiler** The point of it was balance and what happens when that balance is lost. In the movie Aang gains control and triumphs while in the series the whole point was that he lost control and there were major consequence because of it."
1,screw you shyamalan,"Dont need to say anything but, screw you. If The last airbender gets another shot, i hope you dont come near it."
1,beyond terrible!,"wow! did anyone involved in this movie bother to watch the series? well here it is. this movie is about as well done as an after school special was. it is off script and totally wrong. ""uncle"" even has a middle eastern accent or something. like another person said it doesn't even rate one star! i wish i had listened but i had hope i guess.... I'm just glad i didn't buy it!"
1,Can I give it 0 Stars?,"To say this movie was bad would be an insult to bad movies. First, I was not expecting to watch a movie that was 100% accurate with the cartoon story already established. This does not however excuse the painful to watch acting, the things that made absolutely no sense, and the incredible choppiness. This movie is so far beyond terrible that it has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. Even Dragonball Evolution was a better movie.Bottom line, not only should you not see this movie, you should get your money back for buying or renting it."
1,Dead Air,"Worst. Movie. Ever. From the static line readings to charmless characters, from the haphazard plotting to uninspired action/visual effects set ups. If there was a way to make a movie bad, Mr. Shyamalan not only found it, he made up more as he went along. At least hacks deliver a predictable summer commodity, but someone please tell this guy he cannot write nor direct. It's like The Sixth Sense was one crazy fluke. I'm not even comparing this movie to the brilliant Nicolodeon series. This film version has created its very own abysmal level of quality. With a little luck may it stay there and spawn no sequels."
2,familiar but not the same,"this is a good movie for people whom have yet to see the original tv show. mispronunciation of the character's names, the plot is the same but the atmosphere of the show is gone. even the setting in most of the scenes were off. i understand m. night shayamalan had to bunch it all together, and production had to be a certain way because it was a cartoon before it was a movie but they should have just left it as it was and parted with the ""live-action"" dream. it was a miss in my book. not a good film for the tv show followers. :/"
2,Watch the cartoon series instead,"The movie was quite bad. I only gave it two stars, because it did hold true to a couple of the cartoon episodes from the first season. But the acting was poor, and development was sorely lacking. I watched the entire animated series from beginning to end, and it was much, much better than this movie. If you watched the movie and have a bad taste in your mouth, watch the cartoon instead. It's actually a very good series."
3,I'm a fan!,"I really do like this story! We have all the animated versions and I can say I prefer those to this. Done well, but I do feel some of the animated story lines are better in presentation. If you don't have the animated background this will likely be more fulfilling."
3,Not what I expected,"It was just okay, The effects were good and the story line alright but it just didn't have what some of his other movies had."
1,Save yourself!,"There's lots of great movies on amazon prime. This is not one of them. Acting is terrible, dialog is terrible, directing is terrible. It was a movie built for ages 6-9. If you are under 6, you won't understand it. If you are over 9, you will realize it's not exciting, not charming, not entertaining, and has little redeeming value except sharing a name with a beloved cartoon. I do have some relief that the movie was bad enough that there will be no sequel.If you do have a 6-9 year old, they will probably like it. Just hit play and leave the room."
2,Very Disappointed,"The story of course was great, as it is in the cartoon. The special effects were pathetic and the acting was mediocre at best. Everything was too disjointed and choppy. The cartoon flows smoothly from scene to scene. Stick to the cartoon it is a much better presentation."
2,Just horrible,"OK, first things first,pros and cons.Cons first the movie acting and and the martial arts (especialy the firebenders) was horrible. also,the fire bender coudn't just create fire, they could only move it unlike the cartoons. The comedy aspect of the show was like it was put down at an animal shelter for this movie,Sokka was just a strict big brother whereas in the show katara too care of sokka instead of vice versa. There wasalso the fights, which hardly ever had bending it was mostly martial arts... that REALLY SUCKED. overll the pros were,well actually pro since ther was only one at least they were bending in some of it"
3,Come on people this movie was not that bad!!!!!!,I have read so many negative reviews of this movie that its getting to the point that it is ridiculous how many people hate this movie. When I saw the movie in theater I walked out thinking hey this movie was actually no that bad. Now I have to admit that I was a little skeptical at first because I am not a huge fan of M. Night Shaymalan. But I found myself enjoying it more as it went along. The acting in it wasn't great but i've seen other movies in it with worse acting. The action was pretty good and the special effects were pretty darn good.
3,Not bad,"I got this for my 4 year old who loves the animated series. I also watched the comic series and have found it to be a very good one. The movie is not bad, and my 4 year old likes the real life brought to the animated characters."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Over the past several years M. Night Shaymalan has, without a doubt, been getting worse and worse with his creative juices. We've seen this in ""The Happening."" I of course am a fan of the child series Avatar: The Last Airbender, but decided to go into this movie without bias, being a Film student at NYU, and knowing what it means to critique a film. I went in expecting it to be not as good, and it turned out to be TEN TIMES WORSE than any film I have seen in the past decade. I have no patience anymore for Shaymalan. The only reason I'm even giving this film ONE STAR is because the special effects are the most worth watching in this film. This man should be taken away his privileges of making movies. I would give Ed Wood a camera before this imbecile."
2,I thought it was good action.. BUT..,I thought the graphics were good.. the story line was OK.. but when you miss pronounce the names of the characters.. every time you hear the name is just grates on my ears.. I think this movie would have done a WHOLE lot better if the people making the movie stuck with saying the names like the cartoon. It seems like that's the biggest problem they had. Maybe they'll figure this out (if they want to make good money) and have everyone say the names like the cartoon.
1,Waste of time you will NEVER get back,"I love the show. It's my favorite on Nick and I'm 25!Seriously. This movie sucked.The bad:Mispronunciations of character names.Cast was all wrong look-wise not acting wise.The tone of the whole movie was depressing. Where are the happy funny moments? Sokka is cheesy and Hilarious!The movement of the benders were wrong!basically, it was 99.9% badThe Good:The 3d effects. They were the only good thing in this filmI truly believe that those not following the show would be totally confused by this story line. I don't think it's possible to cram 1 whole season into 1 movie and get all the details you need. If the movie had been split into two, it might have had a chance. This was so not worth the money."
1,Disappointment...,"Well, the Last Airbender TV series is probably one of the best made for TV animation I've seen to date. For that exact reason, true my expectations were high. But even without that, this movie was still a disappointment. First, the acting is just terrible. Second, the plot is fragmented and story's just too bastardized. Even if someone didn't see the excellent TV series, I feel that anyone will be disappointed with the result. This movie just isn't well made. Only good thing about the movie is the special effects. Somebody should remake this movie...properly. It deserves better than this."
1,Every performance on the verge of tears,"Bad acting. No tension. Broken Story. No laughter or comedy. Seriously, was every actor in this either constipated or on the verge of crying? I watched the cartoons with my kid and they turned out to be some of the best stories I've seen in some time. Skip the movie, watch the cartoons."
2,disappointing,"We really wanted to like this movie. The acting was so bad, I couldn't believe that M. Night Shamaylan was the director. The acting was LAME. The story had potential, but the movie was very was disappointing."
3,Avatar: The last Airbender review,"I just watched part of the movie and I can see why it is a box office flop. First of all, the acting is horribly weak and Aang seems way too serious compared to the cartoons. The story was also rushed and they were missing key characters from the cartoon as stated by other reviewers. Unfortunately, this film had great potential but none of it was realized because of poor direction throughout the movie. Arggh. I am disappointed to say the least and I really wanted to like this film. Put some damn Asians in it next time, because the protagonist is supposed to be Asian. Did they think no one is going to watch it because the protagonist is an Asian?"
2,Movie is made for those who know nothing about the airbender,"If you have not watched the series, buy this movie. If you have watched the series, do not buy this movie. It does not follow the series well. Pronunciations of names are wrong and hard to listen to (most notibly the main character's). The coloring save during fire bending was earth toned and probably will not appeal to younger children, though 6 - 10 should be okay with it. To imagine the 3D version could have made this movie better of at least more than it is would be a mistake. It was a rushed and very short film, lacking the humor that the series was known for."
3,Not too awful.....,"I had never seen or even heard of the TV series before seeing this movie with my 7-yr old daughter. I thought it was an okay movie, as a kids movie. Simple plot, cool costumes, nothing I wouldn't want her to hear or repeat. I did find the random ethnicity of the actors and the lack of depth in the plot and lines a little disappointing but overall it was okay. Not horrible or amazing, just okay..."
1,Disappointing in Every Way,"Everything that could go wrong went wrong in making Airbender. The casting was bad, the acting was awful, the directing was horrendous, the dialogue was terrible, the story telling was embarrassing, the pacing was wrong, nothing made sense, and the special effects weren't not any more impressive than those found in a good video game.I've seen some bad movies in my day (thanks Syfy Channel), but this may be the worst movie I've ever seen.One positive about the DVD: You don't have to endure the 3D. For that, one star."
1,"It's Bad, Very Very Bad.","Wow, does this movie stink. I've never seen the cartoon series, so I can't compare the two, but I do know when I'm bored and confused in a movie. The plot made little sense, rushing from one scene to the next without any comprehensible progression in the story line. Literally the only two sequences that make any sense at all are the first and the last. Everything between is just jumbled nonsense. The acting is worse still, with hardly any characterization or personality to distinguish one person from the next. I'm having a difficult time believing that M.N. Shyamalan really produced this fiasco. Is it true? Is he hooked on drugs, or what?Incidentially, my 8 yr old neice, who has watched the animated series (and assures me that it is excellent) hated this bomb, too. In fact, she asked me if we could leave half-way through it; so there's another detraction, it even fails as a kid's movie. Stay away from this one."
1,Waste of Time,"It's hard not to compare the movie to the show. The show was sooo good, I had to see the movie. However I was extremely disappointed with the movie. The acting was terrible, the story was ruined, the effects weren't as good as I expected them to be, and they kept pronouncing the names weird. I'm glad I didn't have to pay to watch it. It would have been a waste of money. Shamalayn (I don't care how it's spelled) completely destroyed the my dreams of watching a good avatar movie. Don't waste your hard earned money on this."
1,The 3D is horrible,"Most of the movie is in 2D. The 3D parts are so unpronounced that you can watch them without the glasses and notice little to no distortion. If you liked the movie, just get it in 2D. It's more of a hassle wearing the glasses and paying the extra money for the 3D than it's worth. Had I have been able to give it 1/2 a star, I would have."
2,"If your a fan of the animated series, you won't enjoy this","This movie got me interested in the Last Airbender. After watching the movie, I watched the cartoon series. The cartoons are way better and more interesting. After I watched the entire cartoon series, I went back and watched this. I couldn't stand it. There are so many differences. The only thing that kept me interested was the bending effects in the movie. Nothing better than that."
1,Dreadful,"If you've never seen the show this is based on, you will be completely lost. Skip this film and watch the show, and if you've already seen the show, watch it again (and still skip the movie)."
1,WHAT EVER WERE THE CREATORS OF THIS 3-D VERSION THINKING!!!,"It's sad, indeed, that the creators of this movie didn't take the time & care to PRESENT a film with GREAT 3-D effects!They could have taken this movie quite far with all the water, fire scenes.BOTTOM LINE: IS IT WORTH THE ""EXTRA"" MONEY TO PURCHASE THE ""3-D"" FORMAT? IN MY OPINION...NO! GET YOURSELF THE ""2-D"" BLU-RAY FORMAT...you'll be happy you did!*USE THE EXTRA MONEY FOR ANOTHER FILM YOU'D LIKE TO SEE ""OR"" better yet ""donate"" the extra cash to the ANGEL NETWORK or any legitimate charitable organization, such as: Jerry's Kids, St. Judes Children Hospital, Make-A-Wish Foundation,Red Cross,Salvations Army,Harvest Food Pantry, Potter's House,Susan Korman-Breast Cancer Research, etc. etc.! ;-D"
4,"Much more interesting and engaging than the ""pro"" reviewers would have you think","My kids (8 and 5) have watched this repeatedly, which means so have I. The acting isn't award worthy, but it's good enough to draw you in and keep you. The story and effects are engaging, and the end has us waiting anxiously for the sequel. Overall, well worth the watch."
4,My Son Loves It,"Ok, so the movie didn't get the best reviews, but my son loves it and that's what matters. If your child is a fan of the cartoon, then he/she will most likely enjoy this movie. We got it for a Christmas present this year. Can't beat the price!"
1,"Because you can, doesn't mean you should","Why is Hollywood obsessed with the 'remake'? Just because you like something, does not mean you need to remake it in your image. Sometimes a thing is good enough in its original form. Avatar is a great story, but this is not a great movie. Give it a pass and go find the original animated series."
4,Disapointing but okay,The idea was sound but I guess they plan on stretching it out with other installments. I feel the ending could have been done better so as not to leave you feeling lost.
2,good/bad,"i personally am a huge fan of the show, i love all of the characthers,the plot, etc. the movie itself isnt all that bad because u have to think, this was set out for little kids, not teenagers that have watched the show since i think 2007. if your a person that hasnt never seen the show and u have a kid, it would be good for them. they have cutsey parts, and its not that hard to follow.but if u have seen the shows and are a fan like me, then u will hate this movie. for one thing like another review said. they didnt have alot of characters like the show did. cut out alot of stuff from the 1st season. the actors dont pertray like the real characters. i prob wont watch it again as a fan thing, but i might with my lil sis. overall its not that bad for kids. but if ur fan dont buy, it u will hate it. i personally am dissapointed in the idiot who directed this."
4,I really liked this movie!,"I didn't read a lot of the reviews but see that the majority are not good, but I really liked this movie. I wish it had done better because I would like to see the rest of the books made in to movies. I did watch the cartoon, which I enjoy, and understand that when a movie is based off of a book or t.v. show it's not going to be exactly the same. M.Night did a great job with the adaption. The movie is not as silly as the cartoon version but I think that is a good thing as cartoons are generally supposed to be more over the top in that sense. There were some parts in the beginning that I thought could have been a little better but overall I thought this movie was great!"
1,total despair,If I could give it a lower rating I would...I'm a big fan of The Last Air Bender animated series...but what was done to the series in the movies should e considered a crime...Shyamalan should be beaten with a stick.
1,An abomination of celluloid,"This film was, in a word, terrible. A horrible warping of the creators' original vision. Essentially, Shamwow (I'm not even gonna SAY his real name) turns this exciting, colorful adventure with fun, complex characters into a TWILIGHT rip off that's boring and bland, with dull, winey characters. It hurts just to talk about this thoughtless retread of season one. If you are a true-blue AVATAR fan then BUY SOMTHING ELSE!"
4,I Liked It,I saw this movie first before I started watching the show so maybe that's why I liked it and so many people don't. Now after watching the show I still like the movie. I hope they make Book 2.
4,Surprised by the other reviews,I saw this movie on tv with my 6 year old grandson. We both LOVED it although he did not understand my tears at the beauty of the visuals and the ancient ideas of good and evil. Here is my advantage: I have NO knowledge of the series or of anything connected with this piece other than the archetypical imagery familiar to anyone in our culture. I will order the DVD--I wish I could have seen it in 3-D.
1,What's that smell? Oh I just airbended in my pants...,"what.. a...crappy movie... I love movies. I even love some crappy movies, but this just plain sucked. The main character was not relatable at all. Oh well they can make up for it by a great supporting cast like the dude from slum-dog millionaire? BALY HIIGHHH-RAAALLFF(throwing up sound). All they had to do was throw in a little Steve Gutenberg and a dash of M.C. Hammer and it would have been the worst casting ever.lets see. Redeeming points:well...it was nice when it ended. does that count?Negatives:everything."
1,An insult to fans of the original show.,"This entire movie disgusted me. They mispronounce the names, change the personalities, bastardize the plot, suck out all of the humor, and take away every single thing that made the show great.At least with the show you could actually believe that these were KIDS you were watching, which was the point. This movie made everything dark and broody, and made bending just look silly. I wonder if M. Night even bothered to watch the show in the first place. From what I heard all he did was have his daughter tell him about it after she dressed up like Katara for Halloween. Great.I was really excited when I heard this was coming out, but it just wound up being disappointing. Seriously, don't bother buying it. It'll only encourage them to make the sequels."
1,boring crap.,"2 words for this movie IT SUCKED. boring action, boring story and awfull casting. Im not to fimiliar with the cartoon but im quite sure its not this bad, definitly deserves a reboot with better casting, better story and better director. Do not waste your money like i did."
3,Good Version of the show,"This was slow, but kinda good. I kinda got into the movie and wanted to watch it because Jasper from the Twilight movies was on it. I liked him better when he was in that. I could see this again, not sure if I will buy it."
1,Wow... Just horrible.,There isn't anything that I can say about this terrible movie that hasn't already been ranted about. Just watch the cartoon.
1,sucked,"they hired all the wrong people... producer, director, special effects company and actors in this movie! Dont waste your time!"
1,Terrible,"I normally take great pride in fashioning a useful and articulate review, but this movie just plain sucks."
5,Loved it!,I'm shocked by all the negative reviews of the movie. I really loved it and hope that the second episode will come out soon.
4,Not the worst movie you ever saw,"I feel compelled to say something good about this movie because the one review here now is so negative. This movie is typical Disney-style fare. Good action, good effects. Implausible ethnicity aside, the actors do a good job. Trust me it could be worse - a lot worse. I liked it. Fans of the animated series should also be OK with it."
4,Absorbing account of a forgotten era in American history,"Despite the genteel Edwardian language, C. Hale Sipe produced a painstakingly researched, gripping account of how William Penn's peaceful relations with Native Americans soon deteriorated into the bloodiest conflict on the American frontier: the 18th-century ""Indian Wars"" in Pennsylvania. The approach is surprisingly frank and even-handed for a work first published in 1929.This book is not for the faint-of-heart. Descriptions of atrocities --- on both sides --- are not lurid, but they are certainly graphic. C. Hale Sipe leaves the reader with an overwhelming sense of tragedy, and of noble intentions gone awry. He also calls forth the dead, on both sides of the conflict, and allows the reader to appreciate their fears, hopes, and terrors.Indian Wars of Pennsylvania is a true ""forgotten classic"" of American historical writing."
4,What are you on about??!This album is great,"I saw the other review of this CD and was shocked,I have no idea why anyone with half a musical bone in their body does not appreciate this CD.I really enjoyed it,if somewhat overwhelmed by it at first and then I realised its brilliance.There are jazz influences on many of the keyboard riffs,classical influences and raw electronica.I have always loved Nic Endo's work with Alec Empire and this just proved to me she is a fantastic modern musician .I feel Digital Hardcore and Geist bring something incredibly special to modern music,a raw intesity that is rare in a music scene dominated by popmetal and soulless music."
1,Huh?????,"What the hell is this? Really crappy electronica, I got to thi page from a link on a metal C.D. as it turns out, after listening to it, it is nothing but a 12-year-old banging on stuff in his parrents basement or garage, there is nothing good about this album, it is horrible, the songs are all unimaginative and it gets very repetitve, thanks, but no thanks.-FM"
1,What is really disconcerting to be specific is........,"So called nutritional supplement manufacture's is the fact that an item like this fails anywhere,""Including their web site"",to identify the flavanols used to comprise this supplement.Further,consumers that,""Review"",something you look to put into your body to support a deficiency. Gross negligence. Shame on these,""Reviewers and the manufacturer""Take the time to do your research before you start putting stuff in your body. You save yourself the real risk of doing more harm then good."
3,Just for Nostalgia,"I grabbed several volumes of this title at a great discount for nostalgia. Although Doctor Solar was an interesting creation, he lacks the appeal of a Marvel superhero with emotional and Promethian issues. More so in the mould of an earlier generation of DC-like superhero, this stilted depiction has him absorbing radiation and displaying unbelievable powers, including complete dissemination of his human form into pure energy. This supreme capability renders him invulnerable and his arch-enemy is merely an ordinary human criminal fiend. Thus, the stories plod along a little, enlivened by the terrific covers which help to sell this series."
4,Wonderful Resource,"I thought this book was, as the author put it,""A Beautiful Book"".This is her second book on Costume Jewelry, and I can't wait for her next one. The background information was interesting and the pictures are wonderful. Great resource book."
4,Review by an Australian buyer,This is a big book with hundreds of pages of illustrations covering a huge range of costume jewelry makers. The only reason I did not give this book a 5 star rating - the quality of the photos could have been better.A good buy for the price.
3,BUY A BETTER GUIDE,"I was not overly impressed with this book.It did have a list of a dozen or so of what I'd call ""THE MASTERS"",well know and VERY EXPENSIVE pieces,but none of the lesser ones that you find every day in farmer's markets,auctions,flea markets,yard sales,garage sales,etc.ie NO mention of Sarah Coventry,AJC,JJ,and some others.Okay maybe for a beginners book but mine has been used twice.I've had it for years!"
3,My grandmother's jewelry,"If you are thinking about collecting (a sick, sick hobby of mine) this is a starter book. Be careful that you don't let the costume jewelry bug bite you. It costs a fortune and breaks everytime you wear it. My jeweler and I now have lunch every week."
5,Real Life in a Book,"Wow! What a great book. It reads like todays headlines, from evil people out to destroy our country as well as our world to meaningful personal interactions that ring true in todays crazy world. I sure hope this becomes a movie because it has Blockbuster written all over it. As I read it I keep visualizing how this story would play out on the big screen. It is a great love story wrapped around the world of political intrigue devious characters straight out of history. Read this book you will not be disappointed."
4,A Wonderful Read,"The Evil Doers covers terrorism, war, and love. The issues and events that take place in this book will make you wonder. Though this is fiction, it makes you wonder if the events and issues in The Evil Doers have taken place or will take place.With the war on terrorism going on now, this is one book that may be of interest to you. As soon as you pick this book up you will be drawn into it. And once you finish the book it will leave you wondering, and it may even scare you. It is one book that I am sure you will want to pick up and read again and again.Mr. Sheppard put a lot of research and time into this one, and he done a wonderful job writing it. Not only does he discuss war, terrorism, and love, but he also takes us back to the sinking of the Titanic. Pick up your copy today; you will be glad you did."
4,So far so good,"I have had these wiper blades for about a month and half now. It has rained here in New England every day for the past month, it seems, so they have gotten a workout.So far so good, although I really don't find anything exceptional about them compared to regular wiper blades. They installed easily. There is no noise. But I expect that from regular blades as well. They do cause some treatment to the windshield which causes water to bead up and roll off. Especially when driving at speed, I find I really don't even need the wipers - the water rolls off just as efficiently and it's actually less distracting than having the wipers going.Not clear on the picture, but the front of the frames (not visible from inside the car) have ""PIAA"" and ""Silicone"" written in white lettering. I don't find this detracting at all but you might if you have a strict sense of automotive style."
1,PIAA S.S. Wiper,"I purchased these wipers with hopes that they would live up to all the hype. Unfortunately, they did not meet my expectation. The wipers leave annoying streaks on my windshield. Based off my experience, I cannot recommend these to anyone."
4,Outrageous stories of a neophyte poker player who became the U.S. chief codebreaker,A real tour de force of a poker player in the making. An absolutely good read. Great stories. I wish though he had shown how to calculate the odds for each hand.
3,Great for beginners,"If you know nothing about clocks and want to learn more before you seriously invest time and money, this is not a bad reference. Ignore the title (it was published in 1985!) and most probably worthless as a price guide...and unless you are from California and can't read...it only covers ""American"" made clocks. It's an easy reference and somewhat informative...for beginners."
1,Good for a giggle,"Good for a giggle, or to remind former Bible Belt residents like myself why we left ;-)"
1,You have got to be kidding,"This book comes across as a ranting screed of insanity.One only wishes it were a late night spoof because no real ""educator"" would have cobbled this paranoid and laughable treatise together otherwise. Marrs actually manages to make Rush Limbaugh appear tolerant and rational by comparison---a rather chilling conclusion when it is considered that the author of this work seriously believes his own premise.Myself and other feminist friends had a fabulous laugh over this book---and the guilible publisher who lost money on this project."
3,"As 'Futurist' Tex(E) Marrs conspiracy books go, it's actually not that bad...","And the only thing missing fromClinton-Rodham's face is theAdolf Schicklegrubr mustache!Yes, Hitlery is watching us...and biding her time until shesprings out her claws and at-tacks - in 2008! Probably asVeep First, unless they recy-cle Al ('I-invented-the-Internet')Gore again! No Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,I read this on purpose,"Being a Clinton hater (Hillary, not Bill), a thought this might not be a bad read and too my surprise it wasn't. Done in a Southern-fried Grand Guignol fashion, this is a creative and overwrought expose of the Clinton administration. Mr. Marrs vilifies and airs the dirty laundry of the many Cabinet members who served Uncle Bill and made asses of themselves in the process. That said, if you loved the Clinton era (1993-2000) avoid this, but if like poking fun at Clinton you will enjoy this. Unfortunately it's about as credible as Al Gore."
1,Ignorance is bliss!,"And hatred is easy.It would be easier for some people to swallow if all of our first ladies were ""polite, stand behind your man"" southern ladies."
3,Ho Hum,"This is well written, but the plot gets a bit wearisome at times. I am tired of the stock situation in which the police are portrayed as incompetent, sexist, distracted. prejudiced, etc. while an outsider, a fat wise-guy with poor personal habits, but a good line in patter, stands on the sidelines exuding charisma until (guess what) he solves everything. In this particular case, I was left wishing he'd done it about a hundred pages earlierDid I mention that beautiful women find the fat guy irrestible?"
1,WHAT ARE THE EPISODES????????,HOW DO THEY EXPECT TO SELL THIS THING IF THEY DO NOT TELL YOU WHAT YOU ARE BUYING?
5,To the publishers: Please re-release this video!,"As an avid fan of the Andy Griffith Show, please re-release this video. I'm certain you will have many many purchasers!"
3,Could help - but be careful,"Andy Stanley and Ed Young both pastor mega-churches, so their advice should certainly be considered. I also believe that their hearts are right and I applaud their desire to see people come to Christ and be grounded in the church. That being said, their is a subtle danger laced throughout the book and it is the false assumption that whatever works is good. The ends justify most means. One cannot escape the pragmatism in this book. Pragmatism is fine if decisions are made within the proper biblical framework, but in this case that isn't always the case. In the end, this book fosters a consumer mentality towards the church that results in lots of breadth but not as much depth. There are good practical suggestions, but not much theology, which is sorely needed."
4,Who's Your Buddy?,"The Outer Limits that dares ask the question, ""Who do you fear more? E.T.? Or your own government?""Suffers somewhat from an obviously limited budget - though the limbo settings are remarkably effective, given the nature of the story - and from dated aspects in the script, but an intelligent and thought-provoking story.This one is more about POW's and military psychological torture tests (which were going on at the time, and became something of a scandal in coming years) than about evil E.T.'s, though evil E.T.'s are pondered, as well. The makeup for the gargoyle-ish alien Ebonites is quite memorable and striking, as is the grating monotone of their halting, mechanoid voices. The cast is stellar, especially James Shigeta as a stoic major, Bill Gunn as a cruelly tortured and tricked lieutenant, and Martin Sheen as a too-true-blue-to-be-true All-American private.Gripping, powerful drama. Better than the remake in the new OL."
3,Nightmare = 3.5 stars out of 5,"One of the better episodes of the series and maybe, just maybe, the most memorable. The whole episode deals with the interrogation of human soldiers by am alien army called Ebonites. The sheer starkness of the set and coldness of everything is very effective, giving it a dreamlike quality. The prisoners are interrogated one-by-one because they have information that the Ebonites (and others) need. When the plans are exposed to the Ebonites about the next wave of soldiers arriving, the 5 remaining members of the party believe they have been betrayed by one of their own. I don't want to give anyway if you have not watched the episode, so I will seal my lips now.thank you for your time, David"
4,Complementary readings to this book,"There are already many good reviews to this book, so I will only suggest reading the following books in addition to this work on the vexing question of why Western countries have dominated the world during the last few centuries [the very way the question is posed is controversial!]: 1) ""Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium"" by Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O'Rourke; 2)""The Great Divergence"", by Kennetz Pomeranz; 3 - 4): ""The world economy. A millennial perspective"" (2001) plus ""The world economy: Historical Statistics"" (2003) by Angus Maddison (a combined edition of these two volumes appeared on December 2007); 5) ""Why Europe Was First: Social Change and Economic Growth in Europe and East Asia, 1500-2050"" by Erik Ringmar; and 6) ""The Origins of Capitalism and the ""Rise of the West"""" by Eric H. Mielants."
2,Want to know why the 3rd World is poor?,"Don't be misled by De Soto's rhetoric; he attempts to paint a picture of the third world that ignores the ongoing exploitation of those countries by the first world. Understanding the plight of some of these nations requires delving into their history and critically examining their trade, diplomatic, and military relations with the developed countries. For an analysis which takes these factors into account instead of ignoring them, check out ""Year 501: The Conquest Continues"" by Chomsky."
2,"""Asset Management...OH, PLEASE!""","""The Mystery of Capital:Why Capitalism Trumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else,"" by Hernando De Soto. is a crock of... [he]argues the point, ""The missing ingredient for success with capitalism is ASSET MANAGEMENT. Get real...asset mamagement is only one of the many needed ingredients to trumph like the West! Hello!!!"
2,Duh!,"Do you remember in college when you would get a textbook that repeated key phrases over and over again instead of making them bold, rendering it impossible to skim and a longer read than is necessary? That's the impression this book gave me.Although De Soto's points are mostly valid, they are overly elaborate and sometimes exceedingly obvious. In particular, the segment on squatters in the post-colonial United States takes up a considerable portion of the book, yet proves only a minor point that could have easily been explained in much less.Another major issue I have with this book is that one of the main axioms of the book's thesis, that extralegal settlements are dead capital, is not well justified at all. Without this point De Soto is only proving correlation not causation.If you are the government official of a developing country, then I highly recommend this book. If you aren't, I suggest you find something else!"
5,A Seminal work,"I recently finished ""Mystery of Capital"". It is fascinating and a seminal book in understanding 3rd world economies and my own American economy. I wish I had read it just prior to a recent visit to Cuba. I would have seen everything with different eyes. What I considered ""hustling"" of tourists is really very basic entrepreneurship in a country with few opportunities. I did not appreciate the skill and drive exhibited by the Cubans (and other third world populations) until I reflected on it after finishing Mr. DeSoto's book. If the reforms suggested by Mr. DeSoto and ILD are adopted, America could well become the new third world member. Once the hard working people of the third world have access to capital, their potentials for economic growth defy my imagination. A fine, fine achievement. jjm"
3,Mystery of Capital,"Very interesting book, however I felt it could have been written in less number of pages - author tends to repeat the same theme throughout the book. This does help to understand it better, but becomes too repetitive after awhile."
3,"Interesting, but too long and repetitious","The so called ""Mystery"" in the book's title is indeed interesting, and the solution the author presents is plausible. This in itself make the book (or at least the first 20 pages) a worth reading.However, the whole idea could be summerzied to about one tenth of the book's actual length, or maybe even to a lengthy article.If you are are some government official that has interest in the matter of third world development, then read the complete book. If, like me, you just have a general interest in the subject, you'll get the idea pretty soon, then be extremely bored as you read the rest searching for some new insights that didn't appear in chapter 1.In short, a good idea that's worth reading about, stretched and repeated over and over to create a book. Keep that in mind when you buy."
3,Point of view of a non-economist,"The book offers concepts regarding the difficulty in tracing and carrying on of commercial transactions in the non-developed countries that had not occurred to me, but seems extremely repetitive.If fails to prove that the Western World is successful, because the transactions are easier to make."
2,Must reading for every eighth grader,"I was very disapointed in the book. Everything Mr. DeSoto says is true, of course, and important. Further, it's not understood by many, including many in the west who should be interested and passionately involved. I was eager to read more, for instance, about the real impact of liberation theology and land redistribution (with protective limits on true title and transfer options) on the living standards of the poor. Unfortunately, the people who need to read this aren't interested in learning more about the importance of property rights and the rule of law because it's inconvenient to their worldview. Those who are interested have almost certainly thought and read enough about this subject to find Mr. DeSoto's book to be basic and tediously repetitive. Too bad."
1,very disappointing,"Coming from both developing and communist country myself, I expected to read some serious analysis and convincing explanation for the question de Soto asks in the title. The reading turned out to be very disappointing. The most apparent error de Soto made in my opinion is: large extralegality, lack of property system are all results of underdevelopment, not the cause. Second, as other reviewers have pointed out, it's very annoying to read the same idea repeated again and again throughout the chapters."
3,"Good points, but *extremely* repetitive.","A lot of other reviewers have commented on this book based upon the propositions and assertions made in this book, so I won't comment here, except to say DeSoto's book is enlightening.That being said, this book is overly repetitive. DeSoto makes a good point, and backs it up in the first 50 pages. But then he takes those 50 pages and beats them over your head for the next 100 pages, and you can't help but feel battered by the repetition. He could have delved more deeply into American History and the personalities involved in making the historic decisions in American property systems, but, sadly, he does not."
3,Right but not convincing enough,"De Soto sheds a totally new light on third world and under developpement. But as his first book (The Other Path) was full of concrete examples and took us by the hand into Peru's slums, it is not the case of the Mystery of Capital. De Soto repeats again and again his thesis, like a mantra. But he remains far to general and forgets completely to show us how things work in the field. It thus lacks thee convincing power of The Other Path. It's a shame, as De Soto is certainly right and certainly possesses all the data needed to prove it."
2,Mediocre,"I would have given 3 stars to this book but coming from a recognised economist as Hernando de Soto I give it only two. Although the book explains in what consists his proposal for the development of the third world, he repeats his idea too much through out the chapters. The examples and methods mentioned didn't satisfy my curiosity for his theory. The book looks more a marketing scheme for selling his idea, which isn't a bad thing, but considering the seriousness of the theme, I would have expected a more professional layout.After reading this book,go and buy The Myth of Development : Non-Viable Economies and National Survival in the 21st Century, written by Oswaldo de Rivero, a peruvian as Hernando de Soto. Although not advertised as The Mystery of Capital, it has a better book structure and an excellent analysis of the world's current situation and ways to solve it."
3,One idea book,"A one idea book by Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto: that capitalism will flourish in the Third World (where clearly it has not, give de Soto one mark for honesty) if the poor there, who live in many cases in land that is not legally theirs, would be given a title to the land. Once given a title, they would have collateral to enter the legal market. The idea is interesting; certainly, anybody who has been in a bustling third world market has seen it as a haven for capitalism, not socialism. But the notion that this would be a cure-all for third world poverty is preposterous. Worse, de Soto gives figures of wealth held by the poor (but not under legal title) that seems frankly dubious. Like most one idea books, the author ends up overselling its idea (which is not bad in itself)."
3,Bought this for class,"Bought this for class. It worked well.It is of a great author and is excellent, but you have to be interested into this topic. It is well-written in an easy manner. Glad to have bought this product and recommend this. @eplusq"
5,Must Read for World Leaders,"I would say this book brought me into the study of economics. For that reason it should be a sign to casual readers that it is worth reading; and a sign to economists and others that I do not have the proper knowledge to best review this book for all it is worth. However, I found it to be concise and easy reading. The arguments for why the economic infrastrusture needs to be reshaped in developing countries so to open the benefits of being plugged in to the mainstream of money-making are convincing. For books on economics, this is easy to understand and makes it feel more like reading a well written newspaper article than a book about economic infrastructure and government mishaps in developing countries."
5,explains third world misery,"This book answers questions that have been shrouded in the fog of socialism and communism. The main one : 'If a place does not have an infrastructure in place to protect property rights, then there are no property rights and therefore wealth cannot be created.' - 'One cannot acquire anything as the fruit of their labors permit, if one cannot safely store it somewhere.' - 'You own your car because somewhere in your country's infrastructure, there is document that says that you do own it, and everyone else believes in that document.' A seminal book on the subject."
1,One-Trick Pony,"While the author does raise several points, by the 3rd chapter it feels like de ja vu. Yes, you are really into property rights and yes there's a lot of extralegal activities in developing economies, but do you have anything new to say?! By the fourth chapter, you start wondering how he's going to say what he's already said in a slightly different manner. Don't waste your money, read the comments here and you've basically read the book."
5,water pump,"Here's the one to pump water. Have for emergency use only, appears well built and shipping was fast. Beats the siphon models hands down."
2,Water pump,"Purchased this as a TOY for kids to play. Hooked to a rain barrel. It is a bit hard for kids to pump water. Takes some time to pull water into the pump. Water has some ""oily"" smell from the lube in the device.I wish I bought the regular water spout made of iron.The product would work well for industrial use... not so good as a toy.The pump came FAST and as described from seller."
4,A good book that should be read in addition to the Autobiography....,"I really enjoyed this book as I had previously read ""I Could Never Be So Lucky Again"" by Gen. James H. ""Jimmy"" Doolittle and Col. C.V. Glines. This book sort of dives into the personal later/adult life of Gen. Doolittle in both a touching and sentimental manner to which Gen. Doolittle sort of shied away from within his Autobiography. The Autobiography comes out the year before his death and this book dove tails his complete story. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to also read the Autobiography of Gen. Doolittle. I read this book directly following the Autobiography and believed this to be an important work in addition to Gen. Doolittle's life account. I would only recommend this book in this fashion as a stand alone book I would not have rated it higher than maybe 3 stars."
5,"Doolittle, a true hero",This is just another excellent example of why this country has stayed a free democracy for 232 years.
5,That Old Christmas Story,"Jimmy Webb is one of the most prolific writers of our time and when it came to pen a Christmas album, it was done with passion and wit. Art Garfunkel is in top form and handles the material with great care. Amy Grant, of whom I was not a fan, has something more than a cameo here on An Animals Christmas. This is a must buy album for Christmas, without being cheesy and it doesnt have the old ""classics"" we get to hear in every mall in America during Christmas. You will be able to pluck out this album in July if you want and feel that Webb has dug his own groove for the Messiah's birthday."
4,Reinforces Math Topics!!,"There are so many wonderful things you can teach from this book, and you don't have to read the whole thing from page 1 in order to clarify the concept. You can teach number sense (whole numbers, fractions)and patters/algebra. It's probably best suited for 1st/2nd graders but you can introduce topics with to kinders and reinforce concepts with the older ones. It should be a staple in every teacher's classroom."
4,math,"came on time, great gift idea, loved the product, wonderful service, nice to have around when you need good read"
5,Great as a teaching aid,This will be a great teaching aid in our primary classes.I can see it being used and used by the teachers in our school and I am sure we will create our own improvisations of this book.
1,Cute but really didn't fit!,"I bought two pairs f these for my girls. They're relly cute looking and sweet detailing- but they never fit right! One of my girls has slender feet so I wasn't too surprised when her feet constantly slipped out the abck, so her heel was hanging over the back of the foot bed. But my other girl has wide, round feet and her heels did the same thing! We couldn't get the strap to adjust enough to keep their feet from slipping out the abck. It made them look like they were wearing two sizes too small!"
2,"Agree, they just don't fit!","I agree with the previous reviewer. While they are cute they just don't fit well. My daughter wears a size 10 shoe, we have these in a 9.5. They STILL cause her feet to constantly slip so the heel is hanging over the back and there's WAY too much toe room. Fortunately I didn't pay much for these because I don't think they will get passed down to her sister.My daughter does love them though."
1,Miss represented,This Item only came with the cutter and it was missing the adapter. I had to buy the adapter aside.
5,essential for understanding 20th cent Japan,"A classic -- arguably the most important book on Japanese society written in the second half of the 20th century: the sections on beliefs and values are extraordinrily insightful. See also Dore's other works on schools, work, and village life."
2,OK,This book was OK. The main issue that I have with this book is the fact that once the hero not one time told his family about him being married already (granted the wife left but still it seems like a big secret to keep seeing as your family is trying to get you married to someone else). Then to make matters worse he finds his wife and sees she is pregnant. He helps her with the delivery and they STILL keep the baby news away from his family (his family the ones that want their children to marry and have kids). Then we are made to believe that somehow the hero managed to sneak said wife and baby in the house undetected by his family and he still DID NOT tell his family about the baby. The only reason they found out when they did was when the baby woke up crying and BIG DADDY heard the cries. Really?!?! I just did not like this one too much (my own personal opinion)
4,Good Story,"One of my fellow students reviewed this book in my recent Modern Lesbian Literature. Her synopsis was so unusual, I ordered the book the next week and read it over the weekend.The story is written in an unusual style, with Sofia narrating events to both her lover, Hankus, and the reader. The story of how two young Polish Jews meet in an Argentine brothel is imaginative and holds the readers interest throughout. In a very few parts, the story gets tedious, but it doesn't last long.The ending was intuitive, but still good.In conclusion, a really good story and I have recommended it to several friends."
4,"A well thought out, exciting, interesting read.","I really enjoyed reading this book. What an interesting trip from Poland to Argentina and all as a woman dressed as a man. In my friendship circle the vote is in and it is ""Thumbs Up""!!!"
5,My New Shoes,"My new shoes are just as advertised, I love them and they arrived quickly, I will order again!"
3,CUTE BUT PAINFUL,THESE SANDALS ARE VERY CUTE BUT THE TOPS WERE CUTTING MY TOES AND THE STRAP IN THE BACK WERE CUTTING THE BACK OF MY FOOT. I PUT CUSHIONS FROM DR. SCHOLLS WHERE I WAS GETTING CUT BUT THE TO OF THE RIGHT FOOT STILL GET CUT. i THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE MAKE. I WONDER IF PEOPLE THAT MAKE THESE SANDALS ACTUALLY PUT THEM ON AND WALK AROUND IN THEM.
4,Between a Wink and a Dream,"Between a Wink and a Dream is not what one may expect from a children's book. It is actually a collection of journal entries written by the fictional Thaddeus G. Rabbit in praise of his remarkable family and loving mother. Each page contains a reflection of one of the Rabbit family members accompanied by an engaging watercolor painting. The depth of this book is probably more appealing to adults than children, but the illustrations alone make it a worthy addition to your collection."
3,"Reasonable followup, but lacking a little magic","A College of Magics is my all time favorite book, so I had high hopes for A Scholar of Magics. While it didn't quite meet those hopes, I still very much enjoyed it. Jane, from A College of Magics, is reintroduced and we experience Glasscastle College--where young men go to learn and become wizards. The attitude of the men attending, and of the school itself is very typical and in line with the time frame the book is set in. I just didn't feel like there was quite the flavor and humor in this novel that was present in Stevermer's other books (for example College of Magics, or Sorcery and Cecilia). However, she's still a lovely and wonderful author, and I'm happy to step into the world of Greenlaw anytime I'm allowed the opportunity."
4,Good,"With the fantasy marketplace dominated by books featuring bloodshed, violence, and sadomasochistic sex, this book is a welcome departure. Set in an Edwardian-type world where magic exists and history is somewhat different, A Scholar... is a fairly clever, well written, and for lack of a better word, genteel, espionage type thriller. This book is comparable to several of Diana Wynne Jones' books, which is a solid endorsement. One defect is that is that it is a sequel to another book, A College of Magics, which is solid but not as good, and reading the first book enhances the experience of reading this book."
2,Stretched out of shape,"A fair novelty gift, but mine stretched out of shape in a couple weeks. At least my toes get exercise trying to keep them on. I guess they are made to be seen in rather than to walk around in."
5,Spellbinding,The interesting writing technique brings you first hand into the presence of the characters and illuminates Herman's very sick mind. It is a story of evil gone awry and once I started the book I could not put it down. That it is based on a factual story makes it even more frightening.
1,Don't Believe Everything You Read,"Don't believe everything you read in this book as much more than the 75% suggested by the author(s) is made up. Don't believe everything you read in the 4/5 star reviews above because the book wasn't nearly as enjoyable as they say. Is the book scary? No. Is the manner of storytelling new, unique or effective? No. Those who rave on endlessly about the merits of this work do not read nearly enough. The author(s) open with a narrative figure that disappears never to return after the brief intro. Many of the one-sided dialogue/monologues are too similar in tone and style to make you believe in the characters. What is described as ""the wildest book I ever read"" or ""a totally new concept"" is nothing more than a gimmick designed to disguise a rather poorly told story. Could have been much better, but is not worth the price of admission."
4,Like spying on a series of chilling conversations,"When you read this book, it is as if you are listening to a one-side phone conversation; yet, you can still grasp the main gist of the story: that all of the characters in The Devil's Rood are connected to Holmes in some way or another. This book made me feel squeamish at times, particularly when I read the letters from Holmes to Frank Noland. What a monster!"
1,"Fascinating subject, but story is amateurishly told","A novel about the nation's first serial killer seems like a sure thing. Unfortunately, the way the story is told makes it exasperating to read. The novel is told in a series of short first- person accounts, with each character telling his or her own story. The prose is pedestrian and not at all written in the style of the time period. All the characters sound the same. I'm afraid the writers don't have the skill to pull it off. The story becomes confusing and eventually boring. A straight-forward narration would have worked much better. I still want to learn more about this man, who was the devil incarnate."
4,Devil's Rood,"The Devil's Rood is a fictional account of the life of Herman Mudgett, also known as HH Holmes, one of the cruelest cold-blooded killers ever to have lived and largely regarded as the country's first serial killer. Mudgett, a self-assured man whose handsome looks and suave demeanor are bait for many girls and trusting souls in nineteenth-century Chicago. He runs his demented empire from a monstrous building called the Castle and swindles people out of everything from furniture to life savings to land holdings. Many people lose their lives at his hands as well. In addition, he is a bigamist, marrying at least three different women under various pseudos, and a monster, describing his misdeeds to a mute acquaintance through one-sided correspondence, speaking casually of his conquests as if such a thing were normal.The Devil's Rood is not a mystery in the traditional sense and approach. Apprize its unique first-person monologue style."
5,THE BEST!,"I don't read that many books a year, but ,this book is probably the best best book I have read ever. I love the style, dramatic diolog, and can't wait until the sequence is written! Please let me know if this is going to movie. Would love to give you some ideas to use."
2,Too long on discourse and too short on solution,"This author provides many facts as well as long discussions without a central theme. While it makes an interesting read on the many facets of American higher education, the solution offered to dismantle the higher education as knowledge factory and rebuild it as higher learning is far too light-weight. The author, obviously a social scientist, views the reform from the angle of humanities and social science. While this is encouraging, it is by no means adequate.In fact, Aronowith's solution is not even as good as the one offered by the book ""The Abandoned Generation,"" which suggests separating the undergraduate education from university and make it a separate entity much like high schools are separated from middle schools. Actually, this book is far inferior to the book ""The Great Rip-off in American Education"" as far as ideas for higher education reform is concerned."
3,"Good introduction, but...","While the book serves well as an introduction to the sector, it devotes a mere single chapter, the last, to what could go wrong. What a missed opportunity.The author could have brought the caveats of REIT investing to life by using more real world examples, even some drawn from real world SEC statements.The author spends an inordinate time selling the idea of investing in the sector. My guess is people who reach for this book are already interested or even invested in REITs, and are looking for help in navigating the potential minefields.The book needs a second edition, to bring it more current.Per KPA's 10k, President Clinton signed a new law Dec 99 that allows a REIT to own up to 100% of stock in a taxable subsidary. How does this impact paired share reits? What will be the long term impact of this legislative change on the REIT landscape?A good effort, yet one that can be improved upon."
4,Some fundamental financial problems with this book...,"The book is an easy to understand introduction.Yes, Quality REITs can be a very good addition to one's portfolio as the book states.But the book is a little biased, because one of the fundamentalsof modern portfolio theory is Risk vs Reward.Yet this book has only 1 chapter (out of 12) discussingthe risks of REITs - and even in that chapter the risksare down played somewhat.Yes, REITS can be a great investment true, but the book doesn't give the complete picture."
3,It's like a gold mine!,"You have to do a lot of digging to find what is of true value. A lot of the information in the book was good, but the organization was horrible. The editor should be scolded. Book contradicted itself at times. Early in the book it went on to say you should have a portion of your portfolio and gave several reasons. One of which was inflation protection. Later in a section on dispelling myths it described in great detail how inflation could be bad for REITs. I found that very confusing. I had to read the book or portions there of several times to ge understand all of the finer points and I have invested in REITs for 7 years. The book has helped me better understand REITs, but the information could have been better organized and presented. The information in this one is as good as the other Bloomberg Books I have bought. Fortunately, the other Bloomberg Books were better organized."
5,This guitar is a FANTASTIC buy highly recommend,"I bought this guitar about a week ago and i would have to say:The sound 9/10 sound is 10/10 but for me i was expecting it to have a little more of a distortion sound to it.The looks 10/10 just wait until you see this guitar in person i love the creamy white pick guard and the black and the gold go together so well.The price 10/10 defiantly worth the price I love this guitar, the string that it comes with kind of suck but i wasn't expecting much as far as that goes any ways."
4,i love it,not bad def for the price. the action is great it can be a bit muddy but all in all a clean sound with a clasic look i would have to say you should def buy one
5,Epiphone LP Standard,"I am an intermediate guitar player, and this guitar is perfect for me. There is nothing bad about this guitar, and i cant tell the difference from a gibson besides the name. This is the best les paul you can buy, if your on a budget, or your a new guitar player and dont want to spend loads of money. I have had this guitar for a while and havent had any trouble with the pickup selector, as other people have. Everything on this guitar is stock, including the strings, and it still sounds perfect. If you think the picture for this guitar looks kinda bad, think again. The picture doesnt do this guitar justice, it is beautiful. This is the best guitar for anyone who wants a rich les paul sound, but not the price."
4,Muito Loka!!!,"Pessoal, esta é uma excelente guitarra pelo valor que se paga!!Acabamento perfeito, veio com uma boa regulagem, no precisei manda para luthier.Timbre incomparavel de uma Les Paul, tive a oportunidade de tocar uns 8 meses com uma Gibson Studio e realmente esta guitarra chega com o timbre bem proximo, mais ainda no é igual!"
5,great guitar at a bargain price,"I have always been a fan of Gibson, way back before they moved their main factory to Nashville and started doing a lot of their manufacturing overseas. Because of that, I have alwasys been hesitant about going with one of their non-US guitars, such as this one. Call me skeptical.The price was right, so I took a chance on the Epiphone Les Paul. Was shocked at how good the quality and sound was!!Those who have played ths standard, Gibson Les Pauls will probably notice a few differences, like the lower-quality wood, electronics, and hardware. What you get here isn't bad though. It's just not as good as a Gibson. But you're saving about $2000 though, so I think it's a fair trade.A good sounding guitar!! Good for a beginner/intermediate player who wants a ""real"" Les Paul."
4,A Pleasent Read,"A superb book full of kind words and amazing insight. Ralph Bandini spins a reel of good times with this old classic as he takes us on an adventure that only a man of fishing under his harness can weive. I recommend this book to an angler who is looking forward to getting a good deal of knowladge about tuna, broadbills, and the oh-so-dreaded feel of defeat, while diving into the saltry passion of victory."
4,badass,"No, this album doesnt make me melt as much as Dillinjas old work, e.g. Ghost Stories, You Don't Know (remix), Deadly Deep Subs, or Deeper Love - but its still damn good.While it may be reasonably stylistically generic, its the style that Dillinja himself invented. Pop vocals and sweet sounding synths get utterly pummeled by banging breaks and just the filthiest of filthy basslines. Its like the most hardcore sounding r'n'b ever made. :)Production-wise its just nuts, noone touches this mans sound, hes the king of *angry bass* as far as I'm concerned. The tracks alternate between hard, and very-hard - there isn't a huge stylistic range of material here, but theres many killer killer tracks.And I can't overstate just how *rude* sounding it is... filthy filthy FILTHY. My god..."
2,Nothing new here,this is not very good. after about 5 listens i was very very bored. do yourself a favour and listen first. not dillinja's best work.
3,What a shame...,"Looked foward to the release of this CD for some time. On the whole its a bit disappointing. The first couple of tracks sound great on initial play but after a while they lack the mood and depth of previous Dillinja tracks and become boring and repetetive. Later on the album tracks such as ""Why"" and the title track ""Cybotron"" meld into the same simplistic D&B and become nothing but annoying. I expected alot more from Dillinja: An artist whose previous works such as ""Silver Blade"" were sylistic, dark and threatening.A better buy is Goldies ""Goldie.co.uk"" album."
5,See Lords of the North,See my review of this series. Truly a wonderful wordsmith who can mold fact into fiction. A great read. Highly recommended.
4,"""Pale Horseman Review""",The book gives an idea of the kind of lives that the people of the British Isles led a little more than a thousand years ago. The author also created some interesting characters. It is going to be an interesting series for me to read.
2,A sizable step down,"Similar to other series titles, The Pale Horseman was a major disappointment. Instead of building upon its predecessor, the story became stale rather quickly. Yes, Utred is anti-established religion, yes, he falls in love with another mysterious spicy woman, yes, he wows the crowds with his fighting prowess. It seems like Cornwell is more focused on merely bridging the reader toward the purchase of the next volume rather than actually writing another great tale."
5,Terrific Book,"I'm not sure I would like Uhtred if I met him in person but I am fascinated by him. He is so true to himself and follows his own code of ethics no matter what the people around him think. The description of Alfred in the swamp and just how close England came to being Danish was fascinating. I had never heard that story before this book.But what really captivated me was the final battle scene. It was so real, so vivid that I actually felt like I was there holding my shield in the Shield Wall. It was the first description of a battle that I could actually understand why some men participate in war. I was weary, tired and yet, oddly exuberant. I actually cried at the end.I was so hooked that I ordered the third book from Amazon U.K. as I couldn't wait until the Jan. release in the U.S.While I wait for the fourth book eagerly, I try to figure out who would play Uhtred in the movies. Perhaps Heath Ledger. Any ideas?"
3,Refund Offered Promptly,"Though the recipient didn't receive the book, this seller offered a full refund. This was an inconvenience, but the response to remedy the issue was appreciated. I will probably not order from this seller again."
3,The least one of the Saxon warrior series,Bernard Cornwell hit the nail on the head with this series about Uthred the Saxon who works (controversially) for Alfred the king. The problem this book faces is that it has to describe one of the least interesting periods in Saxon warfare which reflects on the book. B.C. tends to write in a masterful way but even that cannot help the fact that the situations in the books are sometimes slightly boring. This is one of the very few B.C. books that I have to award 'only' a 3-star.
4,Uhtred's journey continues,"This is the second of Cornwell's books about the 9th century England of King Alfred the Great as seen through the eyes of Uhtred. I'd recommend that the books are read in order: each book builds on its predecessor.Uhtred sees - and moves between - both sides in the conflict between the Danish and the Kingdom of Wessex. He is ultimately fighting to recover the lost estates of his father but has sufficient links with both sides in the conflict to be useful to both. And, perhaps, trusted by neither because his loyalties are clearly divided.Again, Cornwell makes the battle scenes of the front line (the Shield Wall) come alive in their chaos and bloodshed. At the same time, the struggle between the pagans and the Christians is part of the fabric of the story.I like the character of Uhtred as depicted by Cornwell. I found the novel both entertaining and enlightening.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
2,Disappointed,"I'm new to Cornwell having first read The Burning Land followed by the beginning of the series, The Last Kingdom and now The Pale Horseman. I listened to these last two on audio.After the first two books I was a fan but The Pale Horseman considerably dampened my ardor. There seemed to be little plot. Instead the story rambled far too long barely sustaining interest or attention.Most frustrating is Uhtred's devotion to the utterly incompetent, double crossing King Alfred. Indeed Uhtred has a proclivity for ""loving"" the wrong people. He's loyal towards the annoying wife Alfred foisted on him, a woman who despises Uhtred, yet he minimizes the woman whose personality compliments his own. Cornwell tries to rationalize Uhtred's mystifying behavior but none of his reasons carry emotional authenticity or believability. I ended up losing all respect for the warrior champion whom I wanted so much to admire. Very disappointing. Made me want to dope-slap Uhtred and kill Alfred myself."
3,Good read,"Pale Horseman was more satisfying to me than it's predecessor, mostly because it didn't have the ""Who shot JR?"" ending. Entertaining. Vivid. Maybe not as much on the personalities of Alfred or the other characters. Alfred was almost incidental in this novel, though it describes a turning point in English history."
3,nice way to pass the time,nice follow on. a pleasant read with interesting historical references. some interesting charachters. i will read the sequel.
1,Big disappointment...Big,"This thing just ain't cut out from the same cloth as the Last Kingdom. It starts out with Uhtred losing a lifetime opportunity b'coz he wants to go home and shag his wife, who he dumps for the nunnery later anyway. I like Uhtred and his attitude, but this book is really uneventful.Take my advice. Don't buy it. Bernie's rich. Doesn't need our charity. I donated the book to a kid in Afghanistan."
4,Another great one by Bernard Cornewll,"These books are really entertaining. If you like historical fiction, definately pick them up. This series is his second best after the Warlord Chronicles."
2,Kinda flimsy for the price.,"This box is a little dissappointing in that the metal is so thin that the box will twist and the latch comes open. I expected a more substantial construction for $25 bucks. The slide holder insert is very cheap thin plastic, and the index sheet that came with it is just a loose piece of paper and not attached to the inside of the box top. This is about what I would expect for around $9.95 or so. I'm glad that I did not purchase the double-sided box by the same manufacturer. I can just imagine the lower half falling open and spilling all the slides on the floor."
5,Good reading,"This is a well-written and researched book.It outlines the history of nomadic raiders including the Scythians, Parthians, Sarmatians, Huns, Bulgars, Turks, Mongols, Tatars who fought against Greece, Rome, Byzantium, China, Russia, Ukraine, and the Ottomans. Hildinger maintains that raiding sedentary peoples was necessary for survival of horse-mounted warriors. They were made extinct by rifle toting infantry.Hildinger is at his best when recounting the defensive tactics used victims of the horsemen. Regretfully, he does not detail the fighting tactics between the Tatars and the Cossacks. His best description is how Roman infantry fought the Parthians."
4,Steppe Peoples - Tactics and Warriors,"Erik Hildinger once again hits the mark with his latest book ""Warriors of the Steppe"". His prose makes this an enjoyable read. If you want to know about the people of the steppe and how they achieved success against their sedentary counterparts, this book will start you on that journey. The book initially deals with a generalization about nomadic peoples and their tactics. It then delves into specific historic groups ranging from the Scythians to the Manchu. While the book is well written, its broad nature as an introductory tract will more than likely whet your appetite for more. I am sure that in the future Mr. Hildinger's excellent writing skills in this subject area will be put to good use in writing specifically about any one of these peoples."
4,Excellent Overview,"Hildinger's history of the Warriors of the Steppe makes one wonder why one of the various tribes did not conquer Europe. It reminds one that Europe played a minor, or at least not as important a role, as one might of learned.The book is straight forward and describes the military tactics that allowed the Steppe Warriors to beat all in their path. What is most interesting is the constant flow of superior warriors for almost two thousand years and the inability of the rest of the world to defeat them. The only thing that led to their demise was the invention of firearms which allowed defenders to obtain the firepower necessary to defeat them,The book is not an extensive history on any of the tribes or nations, whether they be the Scythians, Sarmatians, Huns, Turks, Mongols, or Tatars. In that sense the book is limited. However, it is an excellent overview for one who wishes to get a start."
2,This edition is probably good,"I have an older copy in descripitve notation. From the other reviews, it appears this edition is algebraic. That should make all the difference in the world. My appreciation for this volume was seriously diminished by trying to adjust my thinking to the descriptive. I could see there was some good stuff in there. I'll probably get the new edition sometime. I'm a beginner player."
5,Explains everything in Chess by Science. Most profound chess,"This is the most profound chess book ever written. It has been helpful to my chess in more than 1 ways. I have been playing chess for 3 years professionally, and i knew all the rules of chess but after reading this book, i realized all the mistakes and misconceptions i use to have. I was reading through the index and said i know what an open file is. I know how important the 7th rank is. But after i read this book, i realized that i only knew the first paragraph of each of these topics. It went indepth and i finally realized that i was completely lost and now, i have a solid rating of 1700 without memorizing any openings. Only following the rules of chess, i'm able to counterplay and restrict my opponent."
4,I Have a Really Old Copy,"I have a hardcover 1947 edition of this book which was reprinted in 1958 that i found at a used book store, so i decided to buy it. I haven't given the book a true reading yet however, but i did skim the pages and read some of the more interesting parts. I can clearly see that this book has a lot of valuable information for the player who wishes to advance to higher levels of play. I think the main reason i haven't sat down, read and played the examples given is the fact move orders are given in the old descriptive notation. It can be rather tedious and i tire quickly from it. I find the standard algebraic notation of today much easier to use. So, in essence, i would suggest getting the 21st Century edition. It's a 5 star book but i dropped it to 4 because of the old style being used, which i'm sure the 1979 edition uses as well."
3,"Classic, but better, more modern books available","I'll give this book 3 stars because it's a classic, sure, but there are newer books covering the same things, which are done much better.Check out Jeremy Silman's book ""How to Reassess Your Chess"", it covers all the same things that Nimzowitsch does, but with a more modern approach."
3,Too many other good chess books to spend time on this one,"Nimzowitsch was no doubt a fantastic player, and the chess theory in this book is groundbreaking for it's time. Nevertheless, some of it is outdated--new more effective lines of play have replaced some of the lines Nimzowitsch explains in the book--and it is difficult to read. There are just too many other good chess books to read to spend time on this one."
4,A good book for players,"Ok,This is a text-book of chess.All players should have it.Now the contents:They are very important topics about chess here.Well,the most interesting skill I ever learn is 'frontal attack'.Whenever,you read the book,you will learn a new thing.Ok,If you think Yasser[The editor] will be in his usual style[if you ever read his books],no he isn't.He re-write what the great Nimzowitsch wrote few years ago.The texts will be more like your biology books.But,that's not bad.Instead,it will teach you that to be good,hardwork is the cure.[in all field too]Now,Buy the book.It will be very useful for you.I will give 5 stars for this book but an excellent book means easy too.[sorry,these days,all looking for easy ways]"
5,"A little dated, but---","You can't get better than the best. Like Reassess your Chess today, Nimzovichs book brings Master Stratefys down to the level to where a normal intermediate player can finally understand and enjoy chess. A must on every chess lovers library shelf."
5,hypermodernism,Nimzovich in this book teaches what positional chess is all about unsurpassed up to this day. This book can never go out of date.
3,There are better books available with this same information.,"The information in this book is great, but its sort of a 'step backward' if you read this after reading other more modern books, like those by Jeremy Silman (Amateurs Mind, How To Reasses your Chess, etc.) Establish a pawn center, utilize half open files, pawn chains, effecient piece movement in the opening...nothing new that the Silman books didn't offer. Plus, Amateur's Mind and Reasses your Chess are easier to read and more accessible. My ultimate opinion is this is a good book for beginners who want to develop solid playing strategies, but if you have read other chess books, you probably won't find any new information in this book."
5,The One Chess Book,"My System really is the one chess book to read for almost anyone who knows how to move the pieces and a bit more. The chapters about the passed pawn, the isolated pawn, the open files,7th and 8th ranks are absolute classics. My own playing strength was helped by this book from around 1400 to 1600. I can't think of a reason why any chess reader should not read this book.The edition is nice, type is ok , not great. At least they took care of the algebraic notation fix with little or no errors. Also there is a correction or two of things that the world of chess has learned since the book was written. Even Nimzo's analysis turned out to be wrong sometime. What do you know."
4,The Casino is Open - Enjoy!,"There is nothing funny to Tony Valentine about the murder of his best friend and ex-partner, Doyle Flanagan. Valentine, an ex-cop and a majestro at figuring out the various scams of those who try to rip off the casinos of the world is called upon in the second of James Swain's books about Valentine to try and unravel one of the most complicated deceptions that he has yet encountered. In doing so, he finds himself involved in some of the funniest and scariest escapades of his 62 year old life and the reader is taken further into the mind, dreams and hopes of this most entertaining ""hero.""Swain's stories about the seamy underside of the gambling business continue to deserve our attention and it is really better if you find out for yourself what he has in store for us. I assure you that if you enjoy this type of genre, you will enjoy the journey. I did."
5,Funny Romp,"Funny Money is the 2nd of the Tony Valentine series. I read them out of order, but they were still very enjoyable. Tony is a loveable, complex character. Fast-paced excitement. This is a must read for anyone who knows gambling, likes gambling or doesn't know a thing about gambling."
4,Great Read,"I am a fan of gambling and mysteries. However, I am not much of a reader. A friend recomended the book and it was wonderful. Lots of twists and turns yet easy for a ""non-reader"" to follow. I have read Grift Sense and Funny Money. I would recomend them to anyone. Mr. Swain's casual style and attention to detail are true joy."
5,landmarks of american presidents,"As a teacher and historical author, I found ""Landmarks"" invaluable as a resource tool. I have never found a book so methodically detailed in all my years of researching and teaching. I have read literally thousands of books on American history, but have only a select handful that I own and use on a regular basis. ""Landmarks"" is one of those. Historians, researchers,and students will be devoted to this massive text. On the lighter side, travelers will appreciate its maps and easy to read directions to presidential libraries, homes, and museums. No one should leave home without it. In short, this tome is an Americana treasure trove sure to please."
4,not quite Chiltons,"This book has helped me save some serious time, as I am not an automotive guru. It has also cut down on the amount of trips to the parts store. It could have been organized better, and it should have gone into more detail."
5,satisfactory,"This manual is indispensable for those who want to maintain their car or make minor repairs without getting gouged at the local mechanic shop. The instructions are simple and the specialty tools you may need are usually available at your local auto parts store such as Autozone. It really is a shame to pay someone else to change your brakes or replace your spark plugs. The manual's author is aware of it's limits and will note when a repair is beyond the scope of the book. Really, it is a valuable resource to have for any car you own."
4,"Good, but not quite what I expected.","This sauce has a nice and sweet bbq flavor that is an interesting new twist. I'm looking forward to trying it with some fish, or maybe sushi. The ingredients caught my eye immediately and I knew I'd be trying this one day, but what sealed the deal was the 1,000,000 SU rating in the product description. Don't get me wrong, it's still very hot, but it doesn't compare to Satan's Blood or Mad Dog 357 Silver (800,000 and 750,000 S.U. respectively). In the end it's got a solid flavor and enough heat to join alongside Blair's After Death as my go-to sauces."
3,not remarkably hot or tasty,"This sauce, like many extract sauces (predator sauce is another), has a more acrid flavor that really detracts from the taste. There are superhot sauces like blair's possible side effects that have no extract, instead using red savinas or similar super-hot peppers. That said, the scoville count on this sauce is 90k according to web searches, whereas possible side effects, a no extract sauce, is 280k.So, if you're just looking for a bottle of super-hot stuff to giggle at and threaten coworkers with, you can go ahead and get this, but there's hotter stuff out there. If you actually care about the flavor, do yourself a favor and pass over this, there's better stuff above it and below it on the scoville scale."
1,Too many mistakes to be used in learning Spanish,"Despite the helpful concept of including vocabulary on the same page, in the same order, as encountered in the text, this book will not help the Spanish learner. In fact, it will cause harm. There are numerous typographical errors, some of which result in totally wrong meanings. Do not buy this book."
3,Avoid Kindle edition if you want to learn how to pronounce Spanish,"I bought the Kindle version of this book rather than the paper version with audio CD, which was a big mistake. The book itself is a good resource for those who already know some Spanish and want to improve their vocabulary and knowledge of phrases. But the Kindle reader reads Spanish following the pronunciation rules for American English. Until a Spanish version of the Kindle reader becomes available, it is worse than useless for those who want to improve their Spanish pronunciation."
3,Okay But Not Particularly Helpful,"Interesting material but not particularyly helpful in ""learning"" how to speak Spanish."
4,A great resource if anyone still users a DOS 1-2-3!,"I'm one of a number of contributors to this book and am surprised that its still available. Does anyone still use a DOS 1-2-3? Does anyone still use 1-2-3!But, if they do, this book is comprehensive, detailing how to really use 1-2-3 to accomplish real work. Lotus had great documentation and this doesn't duplicate it. Instead it provides much of the same info with a bit more practical usage examples."
3,Disappointing overview,"An interesting book, given its origins although I felt that there was little that was new in the text. Ideed, I thought that Duncan Hewitt's Getting rich first: life in a changing China was a much more satisfying overview of the ""changing"" situation in China. In addition I also found Jasper Becker, City of Heavenly Tranquillity: Beijing in the history of China a much more satisfying source of information and stimulation."
5,"Ten stars, really!","WOW. One of the most striking, alluring, atmospheric, jazzy, sexy French albums you're likely to hear. When this came out in 1996, I was DJ-ing on a local noncommercial station & whenever I would play it, a dozen people would call to ask ""wow! what is this!?"" If you are looking for a truly enchanting, truly different-sounding record to groove out on, give this a try. This features smoky, Marianne Faithfull-style vocals swathed in a cloak of dreamy, somewhat foreboding arrangements not unlike Marc Ribot-era Tom Waits, or (dare I say it?) the Cowboy Junkies... Highly recommnended! (PS - you might also check out her boyfriend and musical partner, Dominique A, who also has several good albums out, and who co-produced this album... two of the best, most original French rock artists of the 1990s...)"
1,time out chicago,"this is a WEEKLY magazine about events in Chicago: movies, theaters, restaurants.IT IS ONLY USEFUL IF DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNERONE ISSUE CAME 2 1/2 WEEKS AGO. NOTHING ARRIVED SINCE THEN.TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. NO WONDER IT WAS INEXPENSIVETOM PELSOCI"
4,Very interactive,"I bought this toy for my nephew - he loves anything that rattles, so this was the perfect toy for him. He gets to play with the rattle shapes, and it's also educational that they each fit into their own holes to be put away. The entire container also turns into a huge rattle once the shapes are inside. He loves it. My only complaint is the lid sometimes comes undone to easily."
1,Not up to the mark,"Big font,much bigger than needed. Does not cover the concepts in detail. The examples are boring.It's very difficult to move to the next page. There are much better books out there."
2,It Could be Better,The interactive workbook is a good idea. But it seems the author went out of his way to make this as dull as possible. 90 % of the book is about functions with basically the same examples again and again. It's boring and dry. A week after I bought it I put it on my shelf and it's now collecting dust.
2,longer is not better,"After an enjoyable first half of the book, the story had so many twists, turns and implausible actions that this reader said ENOUGH. Finished the book in part because I couldn't believe an editor let so much ridiculous action remain in the book. Too bad, Poppy Rice could have been a fun new character. Won't touch this series again."
3,It could have happened,"I heard the author discussing this book on a local radio station recently. I'd never heard of her, but found the book in my library yesterday. I'm glad that I had not bought it.I live in Connecticut, but am not a native like the author. I am not upset at her snide comments about Texas. That is the way people in Connecticut are. They are very snobby and superior. They do not believe there is anything west of the Hudson that is worth knowing about and they make fun of anything out there.As far as this book, I liked it except for the vulgar language here and there which I guess is necessary these days. It lowers my opinion of the author, tho. She doesn't really have to write that stuff.Interesting story with a few twists. However, Sue Grafton's Kinsey is more to my liking. I don't think I'll read another book about Poppy."
3,This Poppy's not addictive,"This is the first in a new series about an FBI special agent named Poppy. Poppy's a feminazi. Tirone Smith's style is a little too explicit and contains way too much nastiness as she tries to develop Poppy's cynical nature. I like Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski books; this woman tries much too hard to emulate her.The plot's OK, action's good, it's worth a read, but don't expect too much, unless you're a romance reader trying to make the transition to something with a little more meat and less flesh in it."
4,A good read!,"We read one of Coulter's books that was later (time wise) in the FBI series and it was so readable that we decided to order this one which is the first two books in that series. We were not disappointed.Her characters are closer to being ""normal people"" than you find in a lot of other authors' series books. No one is in constant agony over his or her own personal psychological problems, which can get very old over time. The main characters are also not indestructible super heroes who leap tall buildings in a single bound two hours after being beaten half to death by the bad guys. They are just well written books with good plots and decent character development.From book one onward these books provide enjoyable, fast moving reading. If you prefer reading a decent mystery/cop/spy book to watching TV (or even in addition to watching TV), try these books."
3,The Beginnig by Catherine Coulter,"This book contains the first two novels in Ms. Coulter's FBI series. I decided to give her a try since she has written many books and they are rated about 3 stars on average. I am a male and these are clearly romance novels intended for the adult female audience. Still, I read both of them and will keep her in mind for future fill-in reads."
1,awful,"this is terrible; the quality of writing, huge leaps made with no explanation, very predictable, and boring characters. I bought it because of other reviews and recommendations from links from other books I have enjoyed, but this was simply a waste of time."
5,The great Catherine Coulter,"Catherine Coulter is a fantastic story teller - and her FBI tales are terrific. This one, ""The Beginning"" is actually two stories in one book. What a bargain."
5,The Beginning - two great reads,"I thoroughly enjoy CC's writing style, story lines, and the chemistry between characters. I look for great stories, not necessarily documentaries. Keep them coming Catherine."
4,Great Read!,"This book is a great double whodonit mystery. Just when you think you know what is going to happen, something else happens instead. I really didn't want to put it down. This is a combination of the first two FBI thrillers that Catherine Coulter wrote, which, for the price, is a real bargain."
1,Simply ridiculous,This author has written some great books in the series... however I feel completely defrauded by this purchase. Catherine Coulter has slapped a new title on previously released books in a series. I can tell you how irritated I am. Email her your thoughts at: readmoi@gmail.com
1,The Beginning,I don't think it was fair to combine these two books together and give it a new name. I had already read these two books. With the new name I thought it was a new book. Very disappointed.
2,Don't judge this book by its cover.,The title is not what is inside the book. Instead it is a compilation of two of her other books. I sent it back. See my other reviews on Coulter's books.
3,Warning! This is not a NEW Catherine Coulter,I HATE it when I go to the trouble to get a book then find out it is just a re-publishing of old books with a new title.
3,Loved The Cove -- Hated The Maze!!!,"I am a collector of this author -- I think I have everything she has written - and I can firmly say The Cove is my all time favorite! I love the entire book! The beginning from page one gets you quickly firmly hooked and the rest is a fast page turner -- I could not put it down. It is one I really care that I own the hardback & will not loan to anyone!On the other hand I found The Maze to be my least favorite -- I found it to be very depressing & it gave me bad dreams. The story is too sad with a vilian who is much too dark & evil. Too dark for a Coulter fan! Coulter usually makes me feel good about the good guys, not afraid of the bad ones!I would advise you find The Cove as a stand alone hardback and skip The Maze and this new double set............"
3,disappointed,"I was disapointed to find that this was a republication of two old books. Although I will probably enjoy re-reading them, I would not have purchased the item it I had know I had already read the books. It seems to me to be a misrepsentation to re-title books and not tell the purchaser that these are old books"
3,I wish...,I wish I had read more online about this book. I did not realize it was two of the stories in one. I have both of the books at home.
5,YOU WON'T EVER WANT TO STOP UNTIL...........,"The reader is in store for an extremely suspenseful mystery story which will have them turning the pages! Rated 5 stars. Get ready for an awesome book!YOU WILL WANT TO READ ALL OF THE BOOKS IN THE FBI SERIES ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS SHERLOCK AND SAVAGE TAKE ON TOGETHER. ALONG THE WAY, YOU WILL BE INTRODUCED TO MORE INTRIGING CHARACTERS."
4,"Interesting story lines, well written, not transparent.","Picked up one of Coulter's books at lunch one day and liked it so much that I ordered the first four novels in these two volumes ""The Beginning"" and ""Double Jeopardy"". Am 3/4 of the way through and am not bored yet. Having just read a couple of Agatha Christie's in a row, I'd say these compare favorably in wit, plot and style. Good job, Ms. Coulter! I'm your newest fan!"
4,The Beginning (FBI Series),I really enjoy the FBI series! Had read several other Coulter books and have enjoyed them all! Definitely recommend her books!
1,One of the worst things I've ever read,"Wow, I don't know where to begin, with the awful plot (The Cove) or the terrible, choppy writing. Or all of the plot elements that just don't make any sense."
1,Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed to get this book only to learn that I already had them but purchased as separate items! The FBI series, however, is a truly wonderful series."
4,The Beginning,"Reading it now and enjoying it, it has me ecited and worering who is the good buy and who is the evil one. In Sally's life."
2,just a pamphlet,the book is very thin.( a big stack of blank pages at the end to give weight) it could habe been part of the textbook. they just want more money although the book is very needed indeed
3,"Great Idea, needs improvement.","This is the best hands free way to light your way when you're camping or doing anything after dark. I liked it so much I bought 6 more for camping friends and their kids. They are simple to use and very lightweight. They clip to the bill of your ball cap and are so light you don't realize you have it. When you need some light the well placed swith is easy to get to and it floods your path with bright light. I've used it in extreme cold with gloves with no problems. My only problem is the two clips that hold it onto the bill of you cap are part of the molded plastic case. I have had two of my clips break off. I'm not using thick caps. The lights still hold onto the cap with only one clip, but it seems bound to fail long before the lights go out."
4,Overall good value,"This chair is very nice and was quite easy to assemble (took approx. 15 minutes). The construction seems very solid and the base is constructed of hard wood, MDF and steel. This chair is very heavy, ~120 lbs. The directions could have been a bit better yet turned out to be sufficient. My only complaint would be that the seat cushion is not 100% leather as stated, the bottom and back of the cushion are some kind of stretchy synthetic."
