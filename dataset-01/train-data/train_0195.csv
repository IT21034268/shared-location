4,"Very, very good, just pricey.","4 pounds of cherries sounds like a lot, but it's not really that much.They do taste great and other than the cost, I'd recommend these to anyone. I will likely buy them again especially if I can find them on sale. :)"
1,"too sweet, too dry, not good quality","I bought these cherries in hope of making small bags for Christmas stockings. They are horrid! The thick ""chocolate"" coating has unnecessary ingredients in it,and artificial vanilla, so it doesn't really taste like a chocolate coating, but a cheap imitation, and are much too sweet as well (usually extra sugar is used to make up for the lack of good chocolate). I can barely taste the dried cherry inside, and they leave an after taste. This product on Amazon is cheaper, as the cost is twice as much on the company website. But even at the reduced price, I would not buy these again. Amazon says they are kosher in the description, and the plain dried cherries are, but not the chocolate covered cherry product.I have had chocolate covered dried cherries by other brand companies from Michigan that are much better. I will stick with those."
2,not so good,"The chocolate on these cherries was stiff and somewhat stale, and there wasn't enough of the chocolate to complement the tartness of the cherries. My box of cherries was a big disappointment, but it wasn't returnable. Next time, I'll buy Chukar's cherries instead. They cost more, but they taste better."
4,WHERE'S #1,I really enjoyed this made for TV movie. Mariel Hemingway was wonderful as always and the relationship in the movie between her character and Doug Savant's character was very well done. My only regret is that the first movie (First Daughter) in this set of 3 is not yet available on DVD. For some strange reason these movies are coming out in backwards order.
3,Mindblowingly brilliant,"Given my faith in God (won't say which one or what faith) I am supposed to look down on all this new age stuff, and dismiss it at best and denounce it at worst.NO CAN DO with this album.. or artist. I first came across Era on a Celtic VA album, since then I have aquired all three albums and this is the best.If you are not stired by this music, moved in your soul.. check your pulse.. you may be dead. I can not add to what has been said before me on the individual tracks other than to say that The Champions is my favourite, then Shout...Thank you Era (Eric)... brilliant"
4,Definitely from a mind of a Genius...,"The third CD of Era is a mostly recreation of the No's of its previous album...but Eric Levi proves he can craft old wine ..n more beautifully.THE MASS, ENAE VONIFERA...R DEFINITELY FLOWERS OF THE ALBUM...GO OUT N GRAB IT...."
5,Most used pen,"I was skeptical when I got this as a present, but after seven years it turns out to be my most often used pen.I have medium-sized hands (men's glove size ""medium"") and this pen has the exact right heft and balance for me. I write lots of long-hand drafts of reports, and the rollerball gel ink is perfect for fast, smooth, legible writing.After years of use, it still polishes up to a beautiful gold shine, and the normal scratches of wear and tear over the years are tiny and unnoticeable. This is a well-plated pen.The cap fits just right on the bottom of the pen when used for writing, giving the pen the appropriate weight distribution from writing tip o top that makes writing effortless and tireless.I really thought some of the higher priced pens I had were going to be used more, but this design has stood the test of time and preference. I am considering buying another for a highlighter (Cross makes highlighter inserts for the ""rollerball"" line.Excellent design, and an excellent gift."
5,FANTASTIC PICTURES,"My grandchildren absolutely loved this book, the pictures are so vibrant and beautiful."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,"I ordered this book for my grandson and when I received it I could not put it down until I read the whole thing. The cover instantly made me smile and the way it is written, well... my heart danced. I smiled through it all and felt warm and fuzzy. The pictures in the book are great to ask them questions about, get them thinking about what the boy might be thinking, or what will he do, that sort of thing. What a great way to make learning about God's wisdom fun and entertaining. It's a masterpeice and I plan on looking in to the rest of their books too."
4,Nice,I have bought this book many times. I like to give it as a gift. I like the litte girl version even more.
5,My 5 year old looks forward to reading every night,"Every night, my 5 year old son can't wait to read what the next page is. He gets so excited and says with great anticipation ""God's little boy is...."" and then turns the page and waits for me to read him what the next character trait is. Then we talk about it and come up with examples. The illustrations are really beautiful, too. I only wish the book was longer, because we've enjoyed it so much and we go through about 2 or 3 qualities every night."
5,GREAT!,Great book! Great words of Wisdom drawn straight from God's Word. BEAUTIFUL illustrations!! My 3 year old adores this book and so do I!
5,LOVE - not a training manual but great insights into the training process,Great read for those training their pets wanting to follow the positive training method (vs corrective/abusive). A lot of good insight but just note this is not a step by step manual (highly recommend The Power of Positive Training for that).
4,Don't shoot the Dog,"Just what I was looking for! Not only helpful for dog owners but also for anyone interested in personal interactions with family, co-workers or friends in general!"
4,eh?,everyone told me to buy this book but i didnt want to because of the name. a fine book about different methods of training. note to author: the title put me off for a long time. i bet other people feel the eame way.
2,Not at all what I was expecting,"I was hoping for some clear, bullet sort of points. This was not found in this book. It was a boring read. I can usually zip through a book in no time but this one seemed to be longer than War and Peace. There are far better books on the subject out there."
1,Don't Shoot Yourself - You'll Want to After Reading this Book!,"This book is great if you want to train animals. It cannot do anything - ANYTHING - other than that. Behaviorism is lifeless and stifling, and causes just as many problems as it ""solves."" Pryor, a Skinner disciple, agrees with his philosophy that we have nothing to do with our actions. She states that our own creativity is actually a factor of reinforcement by others or the environment. That's not really creativity, if you think about it. This book disgusted me, especially when Pryor started her lifeless rampage that we are ""evolved social animals,"" which may explain why she equates human behavior with animal behavior. She even goes so far to say that sex is a ""mutual exchange of positive reinforcers."""
5,"Positive, timely and unexpected re-inforcement = RESULTS","I found this to be an excellent well written book. Clear and precise examples of other situations that relate to some of the every day challenges that I face. I have already applied some of what I learned in this book to my relationships w/ my kids, dog, wife and associates. The results have been both immediate and amazing. I recommend this book highly to anyone who is seeking positive change. In fact, I am going to order five additional copies right now for friends and co-workers."
2,Don't Shoot The Dog,"I think the meat of this book could have been captured in one really good paragraph. If you want to train dolphins, whales, birds, or even chickens, this book is for you. But, if you want to teach a dog to come, sit, lie down or stay, there has to be a better choice. This is not a ""how to"" book in terms of specific, practical, dog training techniques, but rather a philosophy of training in general. I found the title misleading."
4,Don't Shoot The Dog by Karen Pryor,"Good book for dog training and behavior, however there are lessons that can apply to other aspects of life, including human interactions."
5,Dealing with people & animals: the manual,"I've read this book a few times, and even got the book on cd for my commute. I've recommended it for coworkers who have problems with blowing up at others. I've recommended it for parents.I'm so glad I ran into this book: all because I adopted a ""special needs"" dog and had to recondition some undesirable behavior out of him. I thought I was learning to help him, and I ended up helping my whole life. I'm a better trainer at my job, I'm a more effective communicator with my spouse, and a much better parent. And frankly, I like people so much more now."
2,"Love the concept, hated the author.","Positive reinforcement is a wonderful thing, but it seems like the author got bored of writing after awhile and just started to ramble. Great concept, but I couldn't even finish the book because I couldn't take the rambling any more."
2,Not what I expected at all.,"I am sure that many will find this book very good and very useful. I was looking for more of a practical guide rather than an investigation of the psychological underpinnings of conditioned training. If you are looking for a practical guide to training, look elsewhere."
5,Great book for anyone involved in teaching/training - which is everyone!,"Although I think I'm reviewing the previous edition, I can't imagine enough has changed that this review will be obsolete!Kare Pryor presents the science of behavior in an easy-to-read, layman's format. No more huge textbooks, the general public now has a shorter, fun-to-read (full of amusing anecdotes!) book that will give them accurate information. Although gently promoting positive reinforcement training methods, Karen gives the science behind her reasoning. Great book for anyone who wants to change behavior, from pet dogs to spouses to children."
5,Excellent book! Good tips!,"Great tips for the average reader. Just be sure to read it cover to cover and not take notes out of context. Easy read and very good tips that can help with kids, spouses, in laws, and pets."
1,What about dogs?,Honestly this book was a great study on behavior but did not specially talk about dogs. The repeated reference to dolphins whales and whatever other animals became boring and I couldn't finish the book. I found more info via google! Clicker training is a good training but this book isn't a great guide
3,Don't Shoot The Dog,"The author, Karen Pryor uses a psychological approach for shaping the behavior or dogs. The title of the book invokes humor in teaching and training behavior. Behavior modification techniques have been around for many years and still affect animal behavior when used appropriately.It could be easier to find a particular behavior like ""biting"" if it were listed in the index, so there is room for improvement there. Otherwise, learning about behavior modification techniques is very valuable, not only with animals but also with humans."
2,Wishing for more concrete dog training ideas,"I bought Ms. Pryor's book on the recommendation of a friend who has been reading Ms. Pryor's work. I was looking to get ideas from Ms. Pryor on how to address common problems with dogs--such as walking freely at my side,and to stop barking at the sound of doorbells. Among her books, I chose this one because it had the word ""dog,"" in it and I was expecting most of the book to provide examples and experiences with dogs but that was not the case. I was aware that Ms. Pryor had trained dolphins, nevertheless, I thought her focus would be on dogs. The book offers a variety of behavioral training approaches but most are explained in the context of dolphins she trained, human behaviors we try to change in our relationships and in some rare instances, dog behavior. To put it bluntly, I've been disappointed with the book. I'm in the last chapter and am straining to get it finished."
2,Don't shoot the Dog!,"If you are a behavioralist, then great; if you thought it would be information on how to train your dog then it was disappointing. Maybe 5% on what I was looking for. I was just looking for facts/instructions, not background."
5,Don't Shoot The Dog,"This ia a must have for anyone. This book tells us how to deal with everyday problems in life. Name is missleading, it gives an idea that this a dog training book, but it will teach us how to handle everyday problems, how to rise a child or how to manage with spouse. In fact this is my 5th purchase of this title. I presented earlier purchases to friends who needed it to manage children or spouse."
5,I finaly found it!,"I was so happy to finally find this movie! Not many places in this country have it, so I was thrilled to see it listed. As always, it arrived in perfect condition in a timely fashion. Well worth the wait!"
5,Gloomy Sunday,This movie is set during the beginning of WWII in beautiful Hungary. Not only is the setting wonderful to watch but the movie is so rewarding because we do get our revenge!!!
4,Gloomy but compelling,An associate recommended this film on the basis that after watching it for 5 min you would not be able to put it down. He was so right. It is important not to know the outcome of the story but to let it flow and on that basis the story gradually unfolds to a sad but in some ways satisfying ending. It does not have the compulsion of Schindler's list but deals with similar degrees of inhumanity and in some ways redemption. A very satisfying film in German with English subtitles and well recommended.
3,"interesting, but has nudity","The movie was OK, but I wasn't expecting the nudity. I guess I better check the ratings more carefully. I wouldn't recommend the story."
3,Interesting period piece doesn't quite gel,"This great-looking movie is wonderfully cast and directed, but the script is a bit of a mess. It attempts to combine the (mostly true) story of the infamous ""Hungarian Suicide Song"" with a complicated love triangle and the takeover of Budapest by the Nazis. However, the song thread is pretty much abandoned as soon as the Nazis appear, and the love triangle goes out the window soon thereafter.Still, there are moments of real suspense and poignance, and the cast is a pleasure to watch. Not a great movie, but certainly worth a rental."
5,An amazing achievement,"Gloomy Sunday is a fantastically made film with a wonderful mix of romance and drama. You really feel for the characters. It's a captivating movie with a nice song to accompany it.I would highly recommend this sexy drama to anyone who enjoys a film that's well-directed with splendid acting and a great story.Also, watch it in German with English subtitles. That's how all foreign movies should be viewed: in its original language."
3,The power of what a love triangle can do!,"Gloomy Sunday is a German movie set and filmed in Budapest that is set in a period of the late 1930s - during World War 2 late 1990s. It starts in the late 1930s where a Jewish Restaurant owner and his Beautiful Waitress are madly in love and have a great relationship. They meet a German man ( played by Ben Becker) who also falls in love with the Waitress, IIona and she also falls for him while remaining in love with the Restaurant owner, Laszlo. When the War breaks out and Hungry is under Nazi occupation, the German friend returns as a high ranking Nazi Officer and he uses his position to have IIona all for himself and to get Laszlo out of the way for good!. If you enjoy Love triangle movies then Gloomy Sunday is worth watching."
5,Great shoe!!,"As an emergency nurse, I work long shifts on floors that are tile over cement. After 20 years of this, my back,knees and feet really ache and pain by the endof the week. Add that to knees that will eventually need replacement (too manyyears of high impact aerobics) and a back that is just crippling at times from toomany 400 lb patients, and you have a recipie for pain. I purchased these shoes ona recommendation of a friend of mine and I am completely thrilled with them. Aftera long day I am virtually pain-free and actually able to go for a walk or ride mybike. Pain is tiring and I couldn't believe how much energy I now have because of these wonderful shoes. I will order them again!!"
4,Finally!!!!!,"Been waiting long time for this...knew G. had it in him...became less interested with each album since the debut and sorta gave up on on him after Electric Mile (Except for the incredible Sara's Song, that album just never did it for me)...bought this on impulse...In my opinion, Lemonade contains elements of what put him on the map (the debut)...but incorporates his growth/experience over the years...e.g. Philadephonic, Yeah, etc. Excellent use of guests too...and Jasper's in fine form. Maybe I'll go back and get Hustle now."
2,WEAK,"Almost every song sounds like it could be in a Coca Cola commercial. Instead of ""Lemonade"" he should have titled it ""Yet Another Collection of Insipid Songs For Hippies To Dance To"" The first album was great. I've been disappointed by each one since then. Weak."
3,"fresh, new,a little funk and soul","this is my first cd by G-Love, I like it and I think it has somegood songs on it, some are better than other's and some shouldof been left off,some of the songs sound alike which is the down side to this cd, there's to many that sound like the one you just played , he has his own sound but its the same on just about every song and he needs help from others to much to have a great song, but he's part of this new sound going around with jack johnston , and donavan rankenrieter they all sound the same,I mean Elton John , David Bowie, Rod Stewart, they were all friends coming up also but they all have there own sound and you know who your listening to .Twenty yrs from now Idont think we will be listening to many of these new singers like we are still listening to elton , or rod, the new singers are following each other and copying each other to much they may be solo artist's but they sound like one big group with one sound ."
2,Don't Lean Back,"The plastic back to this chair where the metal back rest brace connects, is too thin to carry normal stress. I leaned back slightly to rest, and the plastic 'popped' where the brace is attached. After feeling the brace poke in my back through the padding and cloth, I disassembled the unit and discovered the flaw. Note that this chair was only 1 week old! Caveat Emptor!"
1,I agree with the guy at the top.,"I bought this CD at a pawn shop just because it had a cannibal corpse song on it. what a dope i am. this has to be one of cannibal corpses worst songs. the rest of the cd was just bland screaming [stuff] on a stick, without fries on the side. too baD."
5,"The Best of the Best, Sir, with Honors","Just about every song on this compilation is awesome! So awesome in fact, that since I bought this collection a year ago I have bought almost every album from where the songs came!! One of Mercyful Fate's best songs. The best Gwar song. Cannibal Corpse kicks butt here. Wardog I found and love. Great intro to death metal also having thrash and new age-metal. And it's cheap!!"
1,"Typical Delillo, self-important without having anything to be really important about","I found this insufferable for the same reason I find most Delillo insufferable, his language is just too incantatory and too bloatedly self-important to really take seriously. He wants to attach profundity and portentousness to everything in sight. Baseball, Nuclear War, J Edgar Hoover, Peter Bruegel, Frank Sinatra... everything becomes a part of this giant, humorously ritualized mythos, which would be fine, but unfortunately fiction needs to have more to it than the atmosphere of a catholic mass in old latin to really function (or at least is does for me). Delillo wants so desperately to be taken seriously, but his vague invocations make it obvious that he doesn't really even know what exactly he wants to be serious about. It seems like he wants to be a prophet of dread, anxiety, paranoia, really of modernity itself. Maybe instead of trying to be an important writer he should just try to be a good fiction writer."
3,A good read but why bother?,"Having suffered through all of Underworld, and having concluded that I should have stopped reading right after the excellent prologue (which essentially comprises this book), I was amused to see that DeLillo has released this as a ""novella"". Compelling reading to be sure, but why bother?I suppose this book is easier to carry around and read in bed than the beginning of Underworld, amounting to less than a hundred pages. But it is difficult to justify spending good money on a prologue to a longer novel with an eerie, attractive cover depicting the World Trade Center, that can be found for less money on bookstore bargain racks throughout the country. Like P.T. Barnum once said, . . . ""there's a sucker born every minute."""
1,Third time's the charm?,"No, not really. Since this novella first appeared in Harper's some years back and then was the prologue in Underworld, this makes the third time it's appeared in print. And while it is brilliant, why buy this when you can buy Underworld for about the same price?"
3,phony delillo,"although don delillo is one of my favorite writers i didn't like underworld and this new release of the first chapter of that pretentious novel is part of the reason why. the only reason to release this chapter in book form is to squeeze more profit from what was clearly a novel written to be a best seller. underworld was a fat, diffuse, complacent and superficial book; the chapter on bobby thompson's homerun never closed with the moment, never really overcame the fact that we all know what's going to happen next and how famous those people are, never got over its own hype. by contrast note the body artist which is intensely focussed, dense with meaning, utterly honest. real delillo."
1,Pafko at the Wall,I never got the book so how would I know. Needed it for a college class and ended up having to buy underworld at a different store. Thanks for nothing!
4,Great Information,"This book is one of those books that takes time to seep in. It is very well and formally written. Very advanced thinking involved. The thing about this book is that it is more about technological dialogue and interaction more than the actual technology. That is why it is so great for AP World History classes. I found that the book can make you just want to skim over and not read the whole thing because it is just compact and concrete so it is hard to take in alot at one time. The book should be read slowly and having an open mind. The information in the book is just great, it goes over the more important ways societies rose and fell. Very helpful for people taking classes or just wanting to know where technology developed from."
4,Technology in World Civilization: A thousand-Year History,"This book is full of information relating to old technology. I would recomend it, for any one studing Engerineering. I also feel it is relevant to anyone learning about history."
3,World History AP class,"I had a choice to read one out of five books for my AP World History Class and I thought I made a pretty good choice. When I saw what books my friends chose, I was very happy I chose this book. Technology in World Civilization does not use complex vocabulary- so I found it easier to follow. It isn't that long- 250 pages. It also has a interesting drawings (they take up pages!). However, this book is very hard to write an essay on because it is pretty much just facts. Overall, it is a good book to choose for an AP World History class, but would not recommend for ""fun""."
3,Hello! What about the S. American potato plant!?,"The book's a great resource if you're a Marco Polo fan BUT..Doesn't he know that the Industrial Revolution was caused by the POTATO PLANT which was cultivated by the Aymara Indians in present-day Peru?The potato plant allowed European wheat-grinding mills to be converted to textile mills and a mere 300 years later, Europe had nuclear reactors.The Ancient Greeks had the steam engine! Heron of Alexandria called his invention an ""aeolopile"". But Pacey didn't explain why Ancient Greece had no Industrial Revolution.Pacey is a physicist. Maybe he knows if the Ancient Greeks had an Industrial Revolution in some Parallel Universe."
3,I Know It's Considered A Classic...,"I know the Big Sleep is considered by probably 99% of anyone who has ever seen it a classic. When I purchased it I didn't think there was any chance that I wouldn't give it five stars in my review. However, I have to be honest, it bored me and I never finished it. As you can see from my other reviews, I am a Raymond Chandler fan. Maybe I'm better off just reading the books and not watching the film adaptations."
5,top shelf,"Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall at it again in a pretty confusing plot. Hard to follow at times but Bogart's delivers great lines as quick as ever. And Bacall - well, she is hot as always.Pretty good DVD transfer for an old flick."
4,Gummy shoe Bogie,"Another private eye H.B.flick. Parallel somewhat to the Maltese Falcon, minus the fat man (Sidney Greenstreet) and Peter Lorre. Good whodunit plot. Bogart and Bacall chemistry, who could ask for anything more. If you like Humphrey and Lauren,you will like this film"
3,Inferior transfer quality,This version has an unacceptable level of contrast that obliterates much of the sublety of the original. It actually compares unfavorably with my home-taped copy off TCM. I also think Amazon should CLEARLY identify this online as the 1945 version!
3,Poor quality,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time over thirty-five years ago in a high school film course. I loved it then, and it still is one of my favorite film-noir movies. I think there are plenty of reviews on the movie plot and actors, so there is no need to add anything in this respect. The film will always be a 5 star film for me.My only complaint, as my title indicates, is the quality of this print. While it is certainly watchable, about half-way through the film there is a problem with the right quarter of the frame. It is alternately too light and too dark as compared to the rest of the picture. Sometime is it so dark it is difficult to see anything at all in that part of the frame; other times it is so light that the figures appear to be ghosts. I give the quality 2 stars.I see some reviews have commented positively on the quality. So maybe I received a poor disc. I would return this disc, and ask for another copy if I were not living overseas. It is that bad."
3,Too Complicated -,Bogart is a private-eye hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down a rich man's sensuous daughter Carmen. This film is far too complicated for most - certainly it was for me.
5,One of my favorite movies of all time,"I just recently rented a remake of this movie and could not understand why anyone would want to change a thing. I had to watch ""The Big Sleep"" afterwards just to get the remake out of my head. This is one of my favorite films and I do own the DVD. I'm tempted to get a second--if I keep watching it maybe I'll need a backup!"
2,All style and no substance.,"With William Faulkner writing the script based on a novel by Raymond Chandler, there is no way that a film can go wrong, especially if you have Howard Hawkes directing and Bogie and Bacall starring. That's the theory. The reality, however, is rather different. The plot is so complicated as to be meaningless. If the people who make the film have no idea who shot whom, what is the audience suppose to make of it. The plot is the hook from which you hang the story. If you can't follow the plot, you can't follow the story. Call me old-fashioned if you want, but I watch films to follow a story. No story: No movie. There is much to commend this film: The dialogue is as sharp as a knife and Bogie and Bacall deliver it with their typical panache. The cinematography is striking. Never has a film looked so noir. However, a story is required, and story is what The Big Sleep lacks."
3,Insanely confusing,"There were some good moments, I guess. But this movie is so confusing and complicated that it makes no sense. It is probably the most complicated movie I have ever seen."
5,A Really Great Movie,"This is a really great 1940s movie. It's a complicated story, and you have to careful that you don't miss something. The acting by Bogart and Bacall is a classic. The supporting actors are also impressive. I downloaded the movie to my Kindle Fire, and plan on watching it many times."
3,Badly needs a better print,"Despite the welcome inclusion of the earlier version and an informative commentary on the evolution of the film, this is not the definitive release we could hope for on DVD. The picture quality varies wildly, from excellent to very poor indeed -- as at least one other reviewer has noted, the right side of the picture is washed out in many scenes (while the left side often seems too dark), and one or two other scenes have a lot of ""noise"" in the image."
3,It's OK,"The pants are alright I suppose, not the best, but then again I wasn't paying top dollar so what could I really ask for? The free blanket it came with had 3 holes out of the package. So much for that, left me quite disappointed with the purchase, but I spent less than $10 so I give it an OK."
4,Very comfortable and snuggly warm!,"First impression was that these seemed a little thin but with the first wash they were much better. On the second wash they were perfect! I turn mine inside out to wash and they come out great. Medium washes out to be about a 30 length.The green plaid was not what I thought I wanted for color but it turns out that it is a very dark green with dark navy almost black plaid that looks really rich, probably nicer than the rest.Want to stay comfortably toasty without too much heat, then this is your pant. Great for lounging around!The black throw looks a bit thin as well but I haven't washed it yet. Nice little extra though."
2,365: Great pieces but poor book design,"This annual is a good example of how pretentious, self important design of a book can ruin it. Otherwise (probably) terrific examples of the latest in American design are reduced to irresponsible unreadable game of the apparently self-important book designer (J. Sterling?) who thinks that her design is more important than the actual pieces selected for this prestigious contest. A complete parody of the functionality of graphic design. 4 stars for the work itself, 1 star for the interior editorial design. Sorry spectacle AIGA."
1,Try and use this..I dare you!,"The book itself looks wonderful, with a nice, strong design on all of the pages. The sad part is this design comes at a price, and that price is the content it's trying to display is completely truncated, and ineffectual. As far as inspiration books go, this is definitely one of the worst books I've purchased. You can tell that there are some real gems located within, but the sad part is you only see the top corner, or little snippets. Maybe next time AIGA should focus on letting us see why the winners are in the book, instead of trying to make an artsty statement in and of itself."
3,Great vision with slightly limited results,"The book itself is stunning. Plastic covers with heavy binding, on heavyweight non-glossy paper. Over 400 pages of sampled work and lots of copy to support each piece.The layout is experimental, and most of the time exquisite.The work, as found in other reviews, seems less relavant than the layout of the book itself. It is difficult to tell which ""version"" of the artwork is the original. It is hard to figure out where the editors added their own cropping to a piece of work, or whether it really appeared that way.Overall, the edition commands respect, but I believe that the work was compromised, and it is difficult to know if i'll refer back to this volume as much as I do other annuals and such for inspiration and knowledge."
5,collectible / innovative,"i didn't know what to expect from this year's AIGA annual but was pleasantly suprised to find that it wasn't typical. Most of these books just mirror the designer back to themselves, and are for the most part a yawn. This one is groundbreaking, and i predict that with all the hype, it will definitely become the most collectible book of AIGA'S history."
4,touching and moving,"In this autobiography Roy Campanella takes you through his life as a child all the way through his debilatating car accident which left him quadripilegic. He asks the reader to please not feel sorry for him. Although at first thats hard, you later see that his life was rich with experinces and love. The book is very moving and I guarentee you will shed tears several times. You really get insight to Roy and find he is very much a lovable gentleman. The book surprising has quite a few mistakes, such as names of people (eg. instead of William Wrigley he writes Phil Wrigley. Also it's grammer isnt perfect. But this is easily forgiven. At the end of the book you feel you got to know Roy,and wished you could have met him."
4,"Well known by his generation, but not as an American hero","Campy was a one of my boyhood heroes. I was devastated when I heard of the crash that cut short a great career for this quiet man. As much as he was a star in baseball, he was more so as a human being. Still alive, when he had no chance to live, he was an inspiration to so many. No longer with great physical ability that carried him to baseball stardom, he rose to stardom as a role model, something greatly missing in many athletes today.Join Campy in the struggles as a youth of mixed parentage, as a star in the Negro Leagues, a pioneer in organized baseball, but even more so as an unsung hero to many persons with and without physical limitations."
2,Yawn.,"A fascinating topic, not helped by a desultory and superficial presentation. The field is inviting: politics, perhaps one of the great venues for projection, begs psychological insight. It's obviously extraordinarily difficult to produce the kind of insight which does justice to the field. This book's problem is not its prose, which is o.k. Rather, it exemplifies the great problem that attends to such analyses: it resorts to assertion rather than data and thus becomes a long document of personal opinion. One may agree, or not, but ultimately this seems less interesting and less satisfying."
5,great show was cancelled but not gone!,"I was not able to catch all the episodes when they aired on NICK, but those i did see were very funny (to adults and kids alike). If you cannot wait for this release you can catch the repeats on nicktoons (channel 178 on dishnetwork). I just found out this channel existed! It airs SAT, SUN and TUES (i think), (i found it by using the search button on the remote) but the listing description does not tell you episode info, so i don't know if all these are the same program. I plan to buy all the dvds, but wonder if there will be a complete box set? That would make any ZIM fan insanely happy."
5,Full of rich creamy goodness,"These are very intelligent, well done cartoons. The characters are very engaging and three dimensional even though for the most part they're a little insane. The production is top-flight. The music is incredible. SO much detail! The people who made these cartoons are brilliant. I hope they're doing something else now."
5,A wonderful discovery,"I have been a lover of Zim since the show first aired and, like so many others, was sad to see it go. I have the first dvd and am waiting patiently for my new one to arrive. I have even gotten my children hooked on our screaming green friend. It is because of them that I made a fantastic discovery. ZIM STILL LIVES!!!!!!!!!! The show is still on the air. If you are fortunate enough to have digital cable, Zim can be seen on the Ntoons channel. Its a channel that shows only nicktoons all the time, including shows that can no longerbe seen on the regular channel. No new episodes, unfortunately, but for those who wanna check it out, its there."
4,funny as ever,"this cartoon is probably the funniest that i've ever seen on tv. i can't really believe that they allowed it to play on nick for so long because its so twisted! it pretty much rocks though, season to is good, but not as good as season one except for a few episodes."
3,mad.,"i got this hopping for a lot of episodes, 2-disc, but i got 1-disc and episodes 1-5, instead of 1-9 like it was sapposed to have."
5,Invader Zim Fan,How could someone not like invader zim!?! I now own 6 dvds of the collection and love it. have watched all of them at least once and some of them a few times. You never get tired of them! You have to have a bit of a morbid sense of humor but after that it's all fun and games. Hope you all enjoyed it as I did!
4,Lets Make Cupcakes!,"The show is completely awesome and I can't wait to buy volume two. It's a nostalgic item!The only issue is that there's a few episodes that seem to skip on my copy. Otherwise, 5 stars!"
5,"""Why's his head so big?! Why's his head soooo big!""","Volume 2 of the best show Nick ever had. This next hilarious DVD has episodes 10-18 of the show. Among many funny moments you'll find the Halloween special and the introduction of the on-going joke of Dib's big head (which actually isn't any bigger than Zim's). My picks for this volume include...Bloaty's Pizza HogDoor To DoorBolognius MaximusHalloween Spectacular of Spooky DoomThe Sad, Sad Tale of ChickenfootGet it now!"
5,DOOMY DOOMY DOOM,"THANK YOU GOD! I was sooo upset when Nick stopped airing Invader Zim but now I'm thrilled that this AWSOME show came out on DVD! The drawings, the comedy everything! Jhonen Vasquez is one of the greatest people ever to grace the road of bizzare and I thank him...THIS DVD SHALL CONQUER EARTH!ps check out Jhonen Vasquez other stuff, it ROCKS"
5,This is especially for big kids,"Zim is perhaps the best cartoon ever to come from Nickelodeon that is mostly for adults. This is something you could easily see on Adult Swim, but there's really nothing to keep you from watching this with kids. In fact, you should watch this with as many people as possible young and old.It's absurdly funny. There are moments when you just freeze in mid thought and burst out laughing because of some of the things that happen.I think Zim is mostly a twisted Calvin and Hobbes. It's just as easy to believe that Zim's whole existence is just a figment of a kid's imagination. The way some of the episodes end, this almost make sense. But cartoons don't need to make sense! That's what makes this perfect. Really one of the funniest shows to make it on TV on any station, don't let the Nickelodeon label scare you away.Just buy it, because Pustulio commands you to!"
4,Hilarious!,"Invader Zim is a very funny series for kids that is also amusing for adults. Highly recommended for families with off-beat senses of humor. Check out the Christmas episode, which was the last one that aired."
4,One of the best Nicktoons ever!,"(...) Invader Zim is a show all ages really can enjoy. This animation series is just what cartoons are supposed to be - just downright silly. I would say it's right up there with Spongebob Squarepants on content. I highly recommend either purchasing or renting this DVD for you or your kids.(...) It's for those who just enjoy comedic cartoons. This will definetly be one for your collection, as it will be for mine. And seeing that it will be released the same month as LOTR-RTK, you can't go wrong. Enjoy."
5,BEST CARTOON EVER!,"this cartoon is one of the best i have ever seen. The graphics as well as the hillarious plot and characters make it a cartoon for most everyone to see. Although it should not be shown to smaller children, anyone over the age of 7 should be embrassed with Zims greatness...now go....buy the DVD share it with your friends and spread the word of ZIM!!"
5,"AWESOME, but y did they take it off?","This dvd is awseome!!! im a major invader zim fan and love all the episodes, but was devastated that they took it off air!!! can anyone help me and tell me y nickelodeon took it off? also on nicktoons they show some of the episodes, but not all, so i hope this lives up to my expectations!!!o and nickelodeon t(**)t"
5,Great DVD!,"I love Invader Zim, this is a great start to get the collection. Many great episodes on it!"
5,The Greatest Cartoon That's Ever Wacked Us In The Head,"Invader Zim may have been shrewdly dumped by Nickalodeon because it was ""too dark"", but it's making a giant comeback on DVD!It centers around Zim, a too-short alien who's about three fries short of a Happy Meal; that believes that he has been sent by his leaders to destroy Earth, when in reality, they just sent him there to get rid of him.This cartoon is probably the most original I've ever seen, and one of the best animated and voiced. To not see it would be to really miss out."
3,Invader Zim Review,"Love this cartoon, very wacky, funny, and kinda dark. Dark as in weird and kinda twisted in a way but a funny way."
4,Endless Laughter,"Invader Zim was perhaps the most genius of cartoons Nick had ever put on the air. When I look at Spongebob compared to Invader Zim, I wonder where Zim went wrong as far as entertainment.The episodes on this DVD are great, esp. ""Invasion Of The Idiot Dog Brain"" and ""Pastolio"" which have become classic episodes amongst Zim fans.It has endless laughter and great animation, it showed how much Nick really put into it and decided to give up upon. If Nick happens to read this: PLEASE BRING BACK INVADER ZIM! PLEASE!"
3,Everyone! dont be fooled!,"Everyone! dont be fooled by the fancy words! this is not the first invader zim DVD collection promised! and certainly not the last, i have baught two invader zim collections being when they arrive at my home, both of them were bootleg, BOOTLEG! promising an invader zim DVD with a name such as that is a little Far Fetched, especially with as little information given. all that there is, is some fan reveiws with hopes of what the DVD is. (...)now mind you all, i am a fan of invader zim myself, but i dont want anyone being ripped off! please seller contact me, because you have not left anyone you're contact information. thank you and good day."
1,It is very special,"I remmember watching this on TV, i never liked invader Zim.It is very, very random, often annoying for my ears and just stupid. I like a little humor once in a while and Gir's very ocassional antics are funny otherwise i am terribly annoyed with all the yelling and lack of sense. It is basicly a loser alien that cant conquer the earth and keeps getting beat by a kid. In the whole process its like ninja turtles on crack.I HAVE A PLAN TO CONQUER THE WORLD! MAAHAHAHAHAHNo you cant ill stop you blah blah blah!...(this is when gir dose something stupid)And the whole plan fails, a few seconds of main hero's sarcastic sister the end. So yeah i got annoyed after the first episode.So if you like ninja turtle son crack go ahead and buy this."
5,Best animated series ever.,"Any fan of the comic books would love this series. It's a dark comedy that really knows how the world works. What better way to say what Jhonen Vasquez has to say than with a deranged alien and a robot with absolutely no sense. I highly recomend this to anyone who has ever thought they may be crazy. You won't regret this purchase! ""I miss you cupcake!"""
5,THE BEST SHOW FROM NICKELODEON EVER!,"I have watched this show since its premier episode a few years ago, and I must say, this is the best show to come from Nickelodeon ever. While it is much darker than many children's cartoons, it is not overly excessive in violence. I am a huge Jhonen Vasquez fan and I believe this is something anyone who enjoys his works should own.If you have never read any of Jhonen Vasquez's work, this is a good starting point. His unique visual style is unforgetable and modern. Not only do his drawing catch the eye, his uniquely dark characters and stories will keep the reader, or in this case watcher, enthralled. This is the most light, least depressing and violent of his works. If you do enjoy Jhonen Vasquez, Roman Dirge is another great writer.I CAN'T WAIT!!!"
2,Can Grrrr Please Fix the DVD,"Invader Zim is demented -- it is quite wonderful. Read the other reviews for the content.However, my review comments on the DVD itself - for this volume and each of the other Zim volumes. There appears to be something faulty about Invader Zim DVDs such that they do not appear to work properly in some standard DVD players. I have all three volumes. None of them work in our main DVD player or our portable DVD players. They only work in my computer's DVD player. Be forewarned that there may be a format issue and that you may experience trouble viewing the DVD."
1,Print on demand at its worst,"Waste of money.This is print on demand book, and apparently all processing has been done by a robot - no human editor touched it and man does it show! All tables and pictures were processed as text, so you get total gibberish instead.This makes the book completely unusable."
3,Local H miss the mark..............,"I totally disagree with all the reviews so far. While this album is good, it's not great. Being a guitarist and in bands myself, the thing I liked about Local H was the HUGE riffs andsuper distorted guitar which sounded huge. While there are some good songs on here, the riffs just aren't there really. I am still happy with album, but prefer any of the others over it. There are a couple of questionable songs 'hey rita' probably being the most unusal. Maybe the lack of production is the problem, because really that massive guitar sound is mostly absent.I really love this band, I always have. This album just does not do anything for me."
2,Doesn't even come close to BOUND FOR THE FLOOR,"I am sorry this album isnt that good, but most local h album suck. I guess just like BOUND FOR THE FLOOR. No other Local H song is cool and as catchy as BOUND FOR THE FLOOR. I give this album 2 stars because of the O.K songs that it has California songs and P.J soles. Do yourself a favor and get the album with the song BOUND FOR THE FLOOR."
4,Solid album...but I wanted more pissed off intensity,"BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!! I'm a Big Fan of LOCAL H since I heard their second album...they are bad ass live...chugging whiskey from the bottle and just playing all out...this is definitely a solid album...I don't want to sleight the band because they are my favorite group and am happy they are still rockin (I see no connection to why every 'critic' compares them to Nirvana...bunch of idiots) BUT I wanted more pissed off intensity throughout the whole album since no one sounds like them or can kick ass like them at full-throttle! But besides my self-indulgent need for unadulterated rage and crazy shenanigans (think downing a bottle of Mr. Jack Daniels or biting a head off a bat), i guess you can say i liked the album so go ahead and purchase it...go on...click the shopping cart button"
2,These were old and hard!,"My dog has taken Pet TAbs all her life and is 12 years old. I think they have helped her over the years; however, this bottle is very different and they do not have the appropriate color; they are hard; they seem old. She will not eat them. I think I should have received a refund."
2,Meh...,"I am a big fan of Buffy, so, when I found out Joss had released a comic which would reflect his vision of season 8, I was eager to purchase it. Well.... I can honestly say I didn't like it. I love the Buff-meister and all, but this seemed really silly and not quite up to par. I think the art also lends itself to the unreality. Every character looks like they are 13. Buffy should at least be in her mid twenties.The plot is pretty simple stuff. Buffy is the leader of a teen group of slayers who fight vampires in the future. Dawn is attending Berkeley and has a really BIG problem. Willow wasn't in this issue. Xander is Buffy's manager. Not a heck of a lot happens.I would pick up a few issues if I could get it in the bargain bin of my local comic shop. But I wouldn't rush out to pay full price. There are better comics out there."
2,Top-heavy,"When I first bought this album I was pretty excited. Judging by the last album V, the new one should be great. It wasn't.What I get from the album is that Neil Morse had this big idea for the double disc concept album, and didn't let anyone else in the band do any song writing. I have no problem with Neil Morse's song writing, he does a great job as the main writer/singer for the transatlantic albums, and most of the older SB albums (especially V). The thing in these examples is that the whole band balances itself out, and Snow is totally top heavy. What happens is the album ends up being 75% ballads, and in between the rest of the band comes up with straight out prog jams that are a little out of place. The idea is actaully pretty cool; a remake of the old rock opera/concept album for the modern times with a balls to the wall spirituality theme, its the execution that is lacking."
3,Dissapointed,"I like very much Spock`s Beard. In fact, is one of my few favorite progessive groups in the last decade (that includes The Flower Kings and Porcupine Tree). The thing that dissapointed me in this record is the noisy guitars, and ocassionaly raspy voices that interrupts the flow of the melodies that, otherwise could be very good songs. The only songs I could stand in this record were the ones that have softer balances, like ""Open wide the flood gates, Solitary Soul, Reflections, Carrie, etc. I think ""All is vanity"" is the best song of ""Snow"". I`ve tried to enjoy the record from beginning to end, but is impossible. I have to skip songs very often (although the story is very good. ""V"" is a better record overall than the two discs of ""Snow"". If you like metal or thrash rock, you will like this record. If you like real ""progressive"" rock, look elsewhere."
3,It lacks of inspiration..afterwards the split by Neal Morse,"Well it should have been a new rock opera, inspired to Genesis ""The Lamb lies down on Broadway""; instead the present concept by Spock's Beard unfortunately doesn't stand in the same place !!It lacks of inspiration and sometimes it takes some usual stuff, which sounds like a deja-vous...The 3rd disc contains the previously unreleased material, featuring a diverse ensemble,as a ""Yes"" coverband,performing the cover of ""South side of the sky"", which is quite acid and not useful in my opinion...anyway after this work Neal Morse decided to leave the Spock's, in order to do different live experiences ...such a pity, because if this work his the Spock's Testament of Neal, it's better to follow other prog bands.Recommended only if you can't stand without Spock's Beard."
3,"Trite theme, uneven lyrics, some great musical moments","SB, prior to this release, has always had relatively high quality lyrics. With ""Snow"", there are still some great lines here and there, but overall there are too many cliches and too little subtlety. The messianic theme is so trite and devoid of new interpretation that the whole thing comes off as naive and sophmoric. There is also a hurried, or unfinished quality about some of the songs as well.Despite these problems, ""Snow"" is still packed full of the usual high quality musicianship, sense of melody, production value and musical arrangement that I've come to expect. Plus, SB is one of the few prog bands that can really rock. Their drummer in particular has some great chops.Unfortunately, these strengths only serve to emphasize the weakness of the theme and lyrics.3 stars because its still better than most, but this was a disappointing sendoff to the Morse era. Too bad."
1,I wanted to like this CD,"I am a big fan of Dream Theather, Pink Floyd, Yes, and Rush. I had never heard Spock's beard until I bought Snow. I heard a lot of good things about this band. I expected virtuoso musicians, epic instumentals, and hard-driving riffs. Yuck, what is this?I would be embarassed to play this in front of mixed company. I don't get it at all. I bought this on Mike Portnoy's recommendation. Thanks a lot Mike, I want my 20 bucks back. This is not prog-metal. This is 80s pop music. Way to many ballads. I will give their older stuff a try, but I am not holding my breath. In the meantime, I'll go see Dream Theather on tour this summer."
1,ugh,"This is nothing but mind numbing prog-noise, very annoying very pointless......i dont see any real musicianship in this band at all whats the big deal with these guys......dont buy this piese of trash."
3,"Not as fun as ""V""","I like these guys a lot, but would still recommend the last album, ""V,"" to newcomers. Spock's Beard is the rare group to embrace the old prog-rock spirit without embarrassing falsetto vocals or lyrics about demons. ""V"" really takes flight and soars, celebrating sheer musicianship and capturing some of the humor of the group's live shows. ""Snow"" - perhaps because of its grittier subject matter - remains earthbound and more musically conventional; at times boringly so. Perhaps the horse followed the cart with the two-CD concept album gimmick. A tribute to ""Tommy"" or ""Lamb Lies Down"" is honorable, but in the old days, a double album would be 80 to 90 minutes of music. Two CDs are more like 120 to 160. The second disc is better and hints at what a bit more editing could have accomplished. If only as much care had gone into the music as the amazing packaging."
3,Weak,"Well, let's just say that this concept CD just doesn't work. I fear that if someone were to purchase this CD as their first SB CD....they would not ever get to hear the likes of ""kindness of Strangers"" and ""Day for Night"" both of which are excellent. SB reached too far with this release and it was a dissapointment in this reviewer's ears....and absolutely one disc too long! I'll be the first to say that I'm glad Morse left if this was to be the future direction of SB."
2,Deja Vu,"Give me a break! Two years of writing, and packaging a 2CD set and ""Snow"" is the end product?? The ""concept"" is nothing more than a retread of ""Powder"" with some ""Tommy"" touches.All the originality of Spock's Beard's previous works have been thrown away with this OVERLONG CD!!The lyrics are painfully contrite andcliche ridden.Save your money and TIME with this one."
2,Bloated and blathering nonsense,"2 CDs of recycled Beard riffs, but even more pretentious than before (and that's saying alot). Everything bad about current prog rock is here: long soul-less songs that ""progress"" nowhere. Don't even get me started about the ""concept"". Don't get me wrong, the Beard's overindulgence can be fun when the hooks are memorable and song lengths are manageable (see Beware of Darkness). But this? Ugggghhhhh!!!!!!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I've been fairly new to Spock's Beard, getting on board after ""Day For Night"" was released. I was really looking forward to this album, until I heard it was a full-blown concept album. I think this album suffers from trying too hard to tell a story. As some reviewers have mentioned before me, the lyrics and overall story seem contrite. Every song strains to tell the story lyrically, and that makes them difficult to listen to individually. I think this is common to concept albums, except for the notable exception (at least for me) of Queensryche's ""Operation: Mindcrime."" The music is quite good, excellent in some places (I think it gets better at the start of disc 2), and reasonably fresh. I just feel like the ""concept"" kills this album. However, it does lead to some exceptional packaging!"
2,this the worst,i just got spocks beards new release.titled snow..im very dissapointed.this cd is so boring.i tried to listen to it over and over and i just cant groove on it what was neal morse thinking.please take my word for it dont waste your money.buy all the other spocks beard cds though those cds jam
3,Snowed under,"I first came to SB with the 'V' album, so maybe I don't count as a true believer. However, I came to really love that album, so I have been eagerly looking forward to 'Snow'. I'm disappointed to say that it didn't live up to my expectations. The individual tracks don't really stand up, and the song writing, lyrics and singing are not - to my ears anyway - anything like as inspired as on 'V'. It's interestingly packaged, though."
2,Lets get real,"First off, I really like this band. I really like Neal Morse. The thing that bugs me is that so many people call this release their best effort. I think that is a joke. Although I have not heard a lot of the post-Neal Beard and I have not heard the Darkness, this ranks as next to worst of what I have heard. Snow was my first Spock's purchase. I was a little disappointed at the time. It's not 'all that'. I bought it because so many rated it high. I'm glad I kept trying. I find ""V"" to be the finest overall. I think ""Day for Night"" and ""The Light"" follow close behind. I am often disillusioned because there is not enough frank reviews on Amazon. Most folks who take the time to review a record do so because they are big fans therefore, most reviews are biased on the positive side. This is a Spock's Beard fan telling it more the way it is - or trying to balance the scale."
5,Spock's Beard at Their Finest!,"This is by far one of Spocks Beard's best albums! Brilliant, compelling compositions tell a mesmerizing story any progressive rock fan would appreciate. This album reveals the true talent of each musician and the genius of Neal Morse's song writing and story-telling. I was enraptured by the haunting melodies of each song. This is definitely one of my top ten all-time albums - a must-have for anyone who appreciates this genre of music!"
3,I don't believe it!,"I would concur with Eric Bukowski's critique.Snow would be a fine album if it stopped at the end of the first disc. Indeed the only tracks that stand out on the second disc are just either part 2s or have themes repeated from the first disc. Nevetheless, one shouldn't forget that the first disc is full of great Beard material. Totally agree about Solitary Soul, without doubt the best offering.If you're after your first Beard recording then go for V, if you've already got some and want more, then buy it, it is worth it."
5,A book everyone can relate to......,"Finally a book everyone can relate to. Black, white, young or old, everyone knows someone or knows of someone who is a character in the book. Kia DuPree has a very descriptive style of writing that puts you right there with the characters. I loved it so much I finished it in 2 days!!!!! I cannot wait for her next novel."
3,Good for general info,I bought this book as a reference book for some research. It seems to have some good general info in it and is a good book to start with before going to more detailed books. I do have a problem with the printer. Some of the pages in the book are printed out of order (see chapters 14 and 15). A mistake as serious as that tells me there was no proofing of the book before printing and packaging.
5,The Cowboys The Cowboy Movie Supreme,"The cowboys is a great western and one of John Waynes best movies. The plot might seem corny, but the cowboys and the rest of the cast make it work, Bruce Dern is psycho when he torrments the young cowboy. The Cowboys is beleivable and better than the average western."
5,"""A REAL WESTERN""",I think this is one of Wayne's best performances and one of his least respected films. I think he showed more character in this movie than any other one that he ever made. Although some think this is a weak story line there is a lot of truth to it.
5,Family fun enhanced by new technology.,"Classic movie. Wholesome entertainment. Fun for people of all ages. Great family movie. Best of all, an outstanding restoration. Looked great on HDTV despite the age."
5,John Wayne at His Best!,A very good movie with a most unexpected outcome! Very entertaining for the entire family to watch.Too bad more movies are not made today with this type of story.
5,The Cowboys w/John Wayne,"This is very possibly one of the BEST story plots and movies John Wayne ever made. He is terrific, as usual, and the color and sound are great. Too bad we had to lose a really TRUE American as he was. Loved him to death. I very much enjoyed this movie. Same as I first saw on TV. Doesn't seem to have any parts cut out or edited. Reputable dealer. Good film.Cecy Ivie"
2,Not as family friendly as suggested!,"We are glad we didn't purchase this movie. We were taken back by all the cursing and swearing in the movie from early seventies! If you are offended by language, then do not purchase unless you have a program to take out all the profanity. The story line was great and the language did not add to it."
2,didn't work for me,I don't consider this to be much of a JW movie since he was not in the story very much. It is the story of how a bunch of children overcome the odds to bring in the cattle. I once had it rated as 1 star but there is something to be learned in this story of perseverence. It is also a family friendly movie so I rate it 2 star -FAIR-.
3,revenge is sweet & so is the duke,"john wayne gives the last significant performance of his career (i dont much care for ""the shootist"", sorry) in this revisionist western from director mark rydell. highlighted by the charmingly amateurish performances by the young supporting cast, and the oh-so-sinister bruce dern in his breakthrough role, the movie is vigilantly off-beat, and more true to the spirit of the 1970s than the 1870s. im not sure wayne fans will like it, but i think wayne haters (oh how i pity the fools) might."
3,Shipping problem,This movie too is a good movie bu the corner of the case was broken on it also. I gave it to my son also.
3,The Cowboys,"Product as Advertised. In my opinion, this is not one of John Wayne's better movies, however it was relatively entertaining. The Blu-ray treatment is OK but nothing special."
4,~~GREAT WESTERN~~,"Hi All.....This movie is excellent if you like westerns or just John Wayne...I have seen this one many,many times over. Bruce Dern is of course a great bad guy!!!"
5,Classic,"Purchased for my husband, but I am a fan a well. Little to be said other than it is the best of John Wayne's movies. Timeless. Highly recommend."
4,Surprising...Much better than I thought...,"I purchased this DVD as part of a package of John Wayne films. I had never seen ""The Cowboys"" from beginning to end and had always believed the story would be too ""corny"" -- even though I love ""B"" and adult westerns. But I was mistaken.""The Cowboys"" is one of Wayne's best films, much better than Duke's films I recall from the 1960s.My only disappointment with the film was the fact that Slim Pickens appearance is too brief. It would have been great to have Slim ride along on the cattle drive.Bruce Dern, as expected, is sensational as the villian. His fight with Wayne is well staged and an intergal part of the story.The boys all do an excellent job.The restoration and presentation of the film on DVD is superb. Also, John Williams's score is beauifully reproduced and is a highlight for viewers with home theater systems."
1,Bad,Would not play without skipping could not watch. All scratched up tried to clean even tried two different players still would not play
4,Not an oater!,This is not your run of the mill oater or the typical John Wayne bigger than life cow man shoot'em up. A well rounded cast of seasoned pros and up and coming young stars melds into a film that is different that most of the western genre.
5,EXCELLENT,"I have seen John Wayne and the Cowboys, when it first came out in the theaters and I have tape of it. I think it is a wonderful movie. I am a huge fan of Sean Kelly and Stephen Hudisand their scenes are excellent. The critics have been hard on this movie. They say there is too much vilence and there isn't a moral to the story. Well yes there is vilence, but the moral to the story is to finish what you started. John Wayne taught them to work hard and if he would have died at the end, then they wouldn't have learned anything."
5,My favorite movie of all time,"One of the best movies ever with a great story about what is possible when people give something their all, even if others say it isn't possible."
5,Prime Streaming,Prime Streaming is GREAT!!!! Great movies at your fingertips! This service allows you to watch many good movies at your leisure.
4,"Makes a lie out of the phrase ""John Wayne couldn't act!""","John Wayne had a rennaissance in the early 70's. His academy award from ""True Grit"" and a renewed appreciation of his work in the 40's and 50's opened up opportunities for him to stretch his acting legs. His work as Wil Anderson in ""The Cowboys"" is one of his greatest performances. It is a very moving role of a rancher abandoned by all the grown men he needed to drive his cattle to the railhead. He is forced to turn to school boys to get the job done. He is a hard man whose own sons grew up bad on him and died early, violent deaths. Now he has to become the surrogate father to these young boys. He is simply magnificent. Especially touching is the scene where they bury one of the boys who died in a tragic accident, John Wayne was never finer and shows that the man certainly had the ability to add depth and emotion to a character. The man was a great actor!"
3,Great Plot But Not A Family Movie,"This is another movie that had a good plot and touching story-line about how harsh life was back then, but yet is ruined by vulgarity and even a very brief scene with young women found along the trail that I would not let a young boy watch. There is not enough family value to make this movie worth watching in my view..."
1,Great Movie but lots of skips,This movie had so many skips it was hard to keep up with the story. We backed it up and you could watch the whole thing going backwards but when you started it forward it skipped again.
5,My favorite John Wayne movie!,"This is my all time favorite John Wayne movie. All the characters are great: Wil Andersen (John Wayne); his wife; Mr Nightlinger (Roscoe Lee Browne); Kate (Colleen Dewhurst); one of the best bad guys ever (Bruce Dern); and of course, all the Cowboys, especially Slim Hunnicutt (Robert Carradine). I've been madly in love with Robert Carradine since I first saw this movie when I was elevn years old!"
5,why the alternate ending???,Can anyone please tell me why the new release of this movie doesn't show the ending where the boys take the money back to john waynes characters wwife??? I have seen this ending before in this movie but in the releases you see today it isn't there???? And also if anyone knows where to buy the original ending please let me know. Thank You.
5,Great Gift!,I got my husband this movie for Christmas. He remembers watching this movie when he was a child. The movie quality is great and he really enjoyed the black and white photos from the movie set that were included with this movie.
3,"It is not Searchers or Shootist quality, but it was good.","This was a typical Duke film in my opinion except of course the fact that he was shot. Wayne is faced with a problem with no solution. His cattle hands have left him after catching gold fever, and Wayne's last resort is taking on school boys. Wayne proves one point in this film,that you don't neccesarly need men on a cow drive. The movie on the other hand proves another;you do not need an all-star cast to make a good movie like this one. On the down side it proves that the good guy (Wayne) doesn't always finish first."
3,John Wayne as sort of a father figure in a story for all.,Young boys would really love this movie I think. I bet it was popular when it came out. It's a very good family oriented western that is a bit about growing up and going out into the world and to face conflicts head on. It's just very good.
5,One of the best DVDs I own,"Not only does this movie feature one of my favorite actors, John Wayne, but this DVD edition gives me the option to watching some of the theatrical trailers of the movies that Wayne made from 1939 on to the early 70s. I only hope that Warner Bros and other companies begin to release all of John Wayne's movies on DVD."
5,the best of movies,great as always. this is one of my all time favorite movies and any John Wayne coolector should add it to thier collection.
5,A comprehensive tool.,"This was one of the first books on latin rhythms I learned from while taking private drum lessons. It really is the only book of its kind to introduce the first time percussionist to basic, structured technique that works for drumset and timbales. Ted Reed has always written no nonsense, staright forward books that I feel should be part of every drummers library. This is another ""masterpiece"" very worthwhile having. I am happy that it has not gone out of print."
3,Too easy not enough challenge,"Beavis and Butthead was fair. Not even O.k. because the game itself was way too easy and I thought that it was going to be funny and it really wasn't. Sure I laughed a few times, but when it all came down to it, the 2 dumbest teens in the world were about as funny as a rock.That and this game was way too easy. There was no true challenge (with the exception of the hospital board) but other than that, very simple game and for a lot of the more advanced gamers, this wasn't even a walk in the park. It was more like taking a nap on a Sunday afternoon.The last thing that bothered me about this game is that the ending was better if you lost on the last board (the GWAR concert) because if you lost, it was more like the real Beavis and Butthead. You know, a couple of morons who lost their objective.This is a renter first. It's entertaining while it lasts, but unfortunately, the feeling doesn't last very long."
1,This is NOT the Forty Niner Red,While this flag looks very nice it is unfortunately the wrong color of red. It is the Red color the team was using a few years ago. It is more of a maroon red than the forty niner red. It is the color they changed to a few years ago during the time when the owners were destroying the team. Fortunately the red color was brought back a couple years ago. This flag must be left over from a few years ago. It is going back. I want no part of the losing era colors.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,This was just what i was looking for the flag is very cool and perfict for tailgating on game day. i will put this flag with my other 49ers flag i have and bothe will look very cool when we are at CandleStick tailgating. GO 49ers!!!!
5,gripping!,"i had picked this book in 1983 or thereabouts from a sale, when i started to read it i just had to finish it to see who the person was committing the murders but to my utter horror some creep had torn off the last page and i never knew who it was. i have searched for this book at various stores but have not located it until today. ofcourse i have to order it from amazon !"
2,Too small,"1. It's very small if you're trying to 'flag' big windows like our floor to ceiling ones in the carport or even out big living room ones.2. One of the set we bought came unstuck and is peeling off, after a couple of weeks.3. Good idea, but needs to be in alternative sizes and better stickum.4. We have found hanging 2'6"" of 1.5"" wide colored ribbon from one end, works well out in the carport, which is open at the other end. But we miss the old hawk silhouettes that used to be on the market."
2,No yellow marker in pack.,I purchased these for the yellow marker specifically. They are hard to find. I just received the markers and there is no yellow! Very disappointed. Would not have ordered if it didn't show a yellow marker.
5,Bold and colorful,"I love the colors, and the vibrancy of the ink. I assume that if stored properly, they should last a good long time."
3,not recommended for child,The colors are not a perfect match to their caps and I bought these for my child for her easel and it's very hard for her to get the caps off and to put them back on well.
3,Some colors didn't last,"I was very careful to make sure all of the lids were securely on each marker, but some of the colors didn't last more than two uses."
1,NOW BETTER ERASING INK - NOT TRUE!,I bought a box of black and they leave a serious residue... not even as good as their old ones.
5,Great Whiteboard Dry Erase Markers,"These were just as advertised. Markers come in a good selection of colors and produce a strong color on my glass whiteboard.I especially like these because they are low-odor (the regular ones give me a headache) and the chisel tip allows me to write a lot in a small space, while still making things easy to see. These are my favorite markers so far, and at a very fair price, too. So far, they seem very durable and long-lasting.One caution - as the package states, markers should be stored horizontally. Get these!"
3,Kinda good,"Not to my surprise, there was an issue with an order from here. The green marker was DOA. One of the brown markers is already appearing to be heading down the same road.I guess I've been lucky, I've never bought a set of markers with one already dried out. I always buy Expo for dry erase boards and have never had this problem.The funny part is other people have also complained about this yet these markers are still being sold!Quality control anyone?"
3,great but....,"I got these today and tested the fun new colors, you know the ones that aren't black, red, blue and green. :) They were all great except for 2, the light blue and the dark brown. The light blue didn't make any mark at all on the board. It was like it didn't have any ink at all. And the dark brown color wrote like it had been used for a long time and was about to give out. Its not worth the hassle to send it all back for 2 markers so I'm not going to do a return, but am making a comment about it. I'm sure not every package is like that but be aware it might happen, especially if you are buying it for a specific color. Its hard to find single dry erase markers."
4,"Great product, but...","one of the pens was dry. Not worth it for me to return as my kids wanted to use them right away, but a bit of a bummer. Otherwise, they are wonderful!"
1,Good if all of them worked,"Received the markers in a timely fashion. Problem was that 3 out of the 12 markers did not work. One marker was dry and the other two were missing the tips. Don't understand how this could have happened. The package was sealed.The ones which worked were vibrant in color and were easy to erase. If only, all the markers worked!"
4,Extensive Listing of Loss Coefficients,Great for anyone in the fluid flow business. Tough read and poor quality photocopy make it a headache to use sometimes. Some of it has ended up in ASHRAE which has much better overall quality.
3,The Grass is Greener movie,"I saw this movie many years ago when I was young, and always remember that I enjoyed it, mainly for the beautiful clothes and the beautiful setting, and the quite amusing storyline. I looked forward to seeing it again, but was a bit disappointed, probably because I am a lot older and it seemed corny and a bit boring. But it is still reasonably entertaining, and worth watching if you like the actors."
1,NO CLOSED-CAPTIONING,"For all you deaf and hard-of-hearing movie lovers out there, this DVD is NOT captioned. The captioning symbol on the side and back of the dvd is fraudulent and misleading. I justify giving this DVD a one-star rating because to a deaf person, that's all it's worth."
3,A Gentleman's Fight For His Wife,"Cary Grant and Jean Simmons are pictured on the cover of the DVD, but this is a movie about Robert Mitchum (an American) trying to win the heart of an English gentleman's wife (Deborah Kerr), and his (Grant) reaction to that attempt. Jean Simmons has a very small role in the movie as a friend of the wife.The plot seems contrived at times, and were it not for such outstanding actors in these roles, the movie would fall flat on its face. However, when you have Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr, and Robert Mitchum in the same movie, it is well worth watching.I doubt any of us would chose the method that the husband (Grant) chooses to save his marriage, but how many of us live in a house that is so large private tours are shown through it just to pay the taxes."
5,The Grass is Greener,"A delightful film. Lovely story, brilliant actors. Very entertaining. Pour yourself a drink, sit back and enjoy."
5,The Grass Is Greener,"In this movie, Robert Mitchum is the rich, suave American and Cary Grant the husband fighting to keep Deborah Kerr. Jean Simmons is after Cary Grant and makes that interesting. The setting is beautiful and the ending satisfying."
4,Light Movie Made Captivating by Actors,"This is a light implausible movie, not chock-full of deep laughter. However, the actors are very well chosen and convey an infectious sense that they are thoroughly enjoying themselves (particularly the delightful Jean Simmons). If you like drawing-room comedies (e.g., Noel Coward's lighter plays like ""Hay Fever""), you'll enjoy this. It's a fun American/British clash of cultures (and who were more different than Robert Mitchum and Cary Grant?) with slight romance and hokum and humor. If you like this one, you'll like the British/American variety in ""The Reluctant Debutante"" (but without the annoying and dated Sandra Dee/John Saxon angle) and the British/American comedy/romance among the upper class of much of ""The Last of Mrs. Cheney""."
1,"Nothing wrong with movie, but DVD fails.","This has always been a favorite film of mine. The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine. Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.Beware! This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!! No subtitles in any language, no line 21 captioning.Nor does it have anything else. ""Interactive Menus"" means scene selections. This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from."
3,Amusing If You Don't Expect Much,"I'll bet that when Mitchum was announced for the movie Hollywood sniggered. Yet I think he did a good job, and held his own with Grant. I've always liked Jean Simmons and think she's a fine actress. For all her fine-boned aristocratic looks, she can play a wide variety of roles. Check out the variety of her talent, before she came to America, as Ophelia in Olivier's Hamlet, as the native girl in Black Narcissus, and as the young Estella in Great Expectations. Grant had three heavy-weight actors to play with, and I think the combined skill level shows in the movie. It's one more drawing room comedy that, for me, gets a little tiresome, but it's watchable and amusing. I think a lot of the credit for this goes to the Grant/Mitchum casting, and to Simmons."
1,Unforgettable (Unfortunately),"This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made. I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies. They are either worse than this one (rare) or better than this one. As an example: Buffalo '66 is worse. If you watch both in the same day, you will surely die."
5,These Snakes are Genius..,"The Hot Snakes have squirmed their way into my head, and they don't show any signs of leaving. The first time I heard this album, I knew it rocked... but I had to play it a few times before it's genius really dawned on me. Now it's one of my favorite albums of all time. Just listen to the creepy intro to ""I Hate the Kids"", the loud, catchy chorus of ""Paid in Cigarettes"", the intense urgency of the guitar riffs during the finale of ""LAX"".. then you'll have some idea of how unique and utterly spell-binding this album is. If you like your music smart, complex, and loud, then you should buy this album without a second thought. You won't regret it."
4,Punk,"For the kids who find Blink 182 and other more slickly produced happy Cali product to be the definition of the term, I point them in the direction of this album for something that hits a lot closer to the bullseye. Fatalistic and hopeful, dirty yet crisp, noisy and smooth. As others have pointed out, there's a great interplay of guitars on this album that hold a lot more menace than most records can muster these days, the vocals somehow manage to be one-note yet never repetitive, and the rhythm section is damn tight. Highly recommended rock and roll."
4,This is not Duran Duran,"Of all the screaming ""guy rock"" on the radio these days, there's not one who wouldn't be standing in a skinny tie and Flock Of Seagulls haircut, playing a Casio keyboard and looking bored in that all too familiar European manner, if this were say, 1981 (see: Stone Temple Pilots, Creed, other screamers, et al.) But Rick Froberg and Co. rest assured don't go with the flow. Simply put: They rock the house with the brute force...a force appropriate to their themes of alienation and frustration.In my opinion, the album is too short and too restrained for what these guys are capable of doing--Hot Snakes delivers black themes without the loose ends of the similar Drive Like Jehu, and does it well, but many of those loose ends help to underscore the raw power of these artists. Whatever the case, I'm buying the next one the second it becomes available."
3,"So far, so good.","I'm taking an Elementary Conducting course and the professor called for the 3rd edition of this book, but I got this one because it is A LOT cheaper. And I have been able to keep up in class just like everyone else that spent 10x more than I did. The only thing that is different is that the examples are labeled in numerical order the whole way through the book instead of starting over in every chapter. But if you can count higher than ten, it's easy to match up the examples. Nothing confusing has come up as far as the difference between this edition and the 3rd edition."
5,Perfect sticky rice!,"My husband and I visited Laos in December 2012 and fell in love with laab and sticky rice. At the Southeast Asian market I frequent, you can only buy sticky rice in 25 lb. bags, so I turned to amazon to see what I could get here. I bought this kit and then followed a recipe in which you soak the rice for about 8 hours and then steam it, wrapped in cheesecloth, in the basket for 30 minutes, turning the package over halfway through. I used about a cup of the rice for two people. The rice came out perfectly, just like in Laos. Maybe I'll buy the 25 lb. bag next time!"
5,animal lover mom,This video was terrific when the kids would take their nap. The animals are beautiful and the facts on each animal are wonderful. The children ages 2 and 3 were able to watch the whole video and retell the facts on the animals.
1,Good tunes but sorely disappointed,"I too enjoy Giorgia Fumanti and enjoy this album. However, I was sorely disappointed to find that the last two tracks were left off the ablum as described by the previous reviewer. Don't buy this album. As consumers, we need to take a stand when we're obviously getting ripped off..."
2,NO CDR'S PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I didn't spend six figures on my system to hear a magnificent voice duped on a computer in 8 bit.I wish I could operate MY business without extending any capital.
2,Intriguing but rather flat,"The idea of an italian soprano doing Vangelis vocal music may sound intriguing to many, as it was to me. But upon a cursory listen its main flaw becomes evident: all the songs are given a light ""pop"" treatment. Gioaria's voice is fine enough but lacks some more expressive range, all the tracks have more or less the same atmosphere, so four songs into the album you are no longer in for any surprises.Maybe the main flaw actually is the absence of Vangelis himself. With him at the helm, this project may have come out very differently. I'd say seek out the originals instead."
1,One was bad,One of the tubes didn't work and it's not possible to use it without it breaking my lens? It just drops off' it's like the tread was slipping...
5,An excellent supplement,"This is one of the best Magnesium supplements I've tried. Very absorbable. I need to take far less of this than other brands in order for it to be effective. I haven't found one better than this other than powder mix. Peter Gillham's Natural Calm is EXCELLENT powder mix if you want to drink your magnesium supplement Natural Calm 16 Oz by Peter Gillham's Natural Vitality. It tastes great and doesn't have any sugar in it, how cool is that?! But for a pill/capsule form of magnesium, this is excellent."
3,Used Universal Trailer Couple,"The timing of mailing came sooner than I expected and was just it time for my trip. When I first used the lock it's mechanism worked fine, but I installed it on a older type trailer latch and it fell off as soon as I pulled on the trailer coupler release. After falling it would not lock or unlock so I could retry mounting in a different fashion (with release latch raised). After many tries I droped it accidently and it fixed itself and is still working. The most important part of this coupler is that it locks to the rim of the coupler and if you have a an older or newer trailer it will do the job."
4,"Trailer is safe, but not your fingers...",Very good quality lock. It just takes some practice installing and removing withoutpinching your fingers or having this 3 lb. monster falling on your toes. Be sure to always keep one hand underneath it and your toes out from under it.
1,Don't waste the thief's thirty seconds,"I just bought a trailer and was pleased the seller was going to throw in this lock...until he couldn't find the key. A flat head screwdriver, a claw hammer and two clicks....this baby was on the ground in pieces. I won't own one now."
5,"easy to install, good quality",this lock is easy to install and remove. I feel secure knowing that master lock has one of my more expensive assets (boat) protected from thieves.
1,Do not buy this!!!!!!!!!!,"I had the same lock, an older one / different model. I had to break/cut it off one day and it was nearly impossible. When replacing it I decided to buy two more. One day I went to pick up the trailer I had the new lock installed on. I realized I didn't have the right set of keys with me. I did what we have all done at some point, I tried a different masterlock key, IT WORKED!!! Then I decided to try my other masterlock keys, THEY ALL WORKED!! EVERY ONE OF THEM, I couldn't believe it. Random keys I have had for years, new keys, they all worked. I tried the keys on the other lock, they worked on it too. I had a fleeting thought of becoming a thief with my discovery."
1,Loved it! Until it was broken off by a would-be thief.,"I'm still in total disbelief, but after visiting our vintage Airstream last night we discovered someone had tried to steal it and had gotten as far as breaking off the hitch lock.I've always trusted Master Lock, and perhaps this was just a very smart and resourceful thief+, but they were able to bust it off.Any lock I trust to, at the very least, not be busted open gets 1 star.Sorry Master Lock."
4,EXCELLENT LOCK,"GOOD LOCK HEAVY DUTY,FEEL SAFE LEAVING MY TRAILER AT THE MARINA, MASTER LOCK MAKES QUALITY PRODUCTS . EASY TO USE ON AND OFF."
3,Lock,"This is a pretty good lock. One problem is that the tumbler lock tries to stick alot so it can be difficult to unlock at times. Other than that it is very theft proof. Not a bad lock, not the greatest either."
3,Trailer Hitch Lock,Item arrived on time in new condition. Have not had a chance to test it. the only test could be someone trying to steal the trailer. It looks strong though.
4,Shining early,"In Remembering People chapter, 'Gail' - Hope Goldbergs essay describes her ballet teacher and ends up showing the commitment of both to dancing. In a span of three pages it becomes a reversible jacket."
4,More Falco,"I was introduced to Falco through my daughter's Latin teacher, who loaned us all of the books except this one. I whipped through them all, loving Falco, Helena, and all the rest of the colorful characters. I also liked this one, though it was darker than the others. It might have been the gloomy/chilly/too hot weather (Falco is never happy about the weather!). It might have been the reports of the deaths of two children back in Rome, though I'm pretty sure this was a common occurance. It might just have been Falco's black mood through most of the book. He seemed to be sulking just a bit, wanting to go back to sunny Rome, not staying in murky Britain with his wife's relatives. Either way, I enjoyed it a lot. Fans of the Falco mysteries will, too. Beginners should start with the first one."
2,Still not on form,"Something odd happened with the previous Falco novel, 'A body in the bathhouse'. The series is generally very reliable, but it started to dive and reached bottom with that book. The Jupiter Myth is inevitably an improvement -- but not much. It's set in Londinium, but the plot is a retread of 'Time to Depart'. Somehow it grates. On the one hand, we expect Londinium to be pretty rural and basic. But on the other hand we have this crime syndicate operating, invisibly? This simply doesn't work. Helena is nagging Falco, which doesn't really work either.So it's hard to recommend this one. Buy one of the earlier ones: anything up to and including ""One virgin too many""."
3,The Jupiter Myth,"The Romans stayed in Britian for four hundred years, but Falco has already been there too long. That's what is wrong with this book and the one before it. Rome is as much a character in this series as any of the humans. I can see where the idea of going to Celtic Britian where Falco had a past would be intriguing to an author, but it didn't work out very well."
3,saw it at a premiere in germany,"i even met andre eisermann. nice guy, who enjoyed his visit to L.A., especially venice beach. i think the movie is very interesting, but it's really strange as well. the music is fantastic, as well as the scenery."
4,Immensely spiritual. Goes to the depth of genious and love.,"In a very remote village, the most extraordinary man is made. A musician of unusual talent and psychic ability. He is not concerned about fame or fitting into the ""norms"" of his day. He only knows what he loves more than life itself, music and Elsbeth. Very real and moving. The movie shows the depths of his suffering as he searches for an unfulfilled longing. Not a hollywood happy ending, but leaves one with the intense feeling of his divinity. Sometimes violent, but not gruesome, and not without purpose. Very emotionally provocative. A must see!"
5,WARNING!!!! This price is a rip off. Go to Ebay!,"I bought it for 5 bucks from Ebay, brand new. GREAT FILM.Amazon charges effing $50 over? You would have to be insane to buy it from Amazon."
5,I'm Happy Now!,"I don't believe it! After thinking I'd never get the songs from their album ""Song"" on CD, that they excluded from their other excellent anthology...here they are on CD! I am so happy! My ""Song"" album is scratched to bits. Now, I can just hit the ""repeat"" button on the CD player, and listen to over and over again...""Nobody Loves You But Me..."""
3,Good & bad,"Sure, lots of rare LP cuts on here, but the sound on this collection is kinda poor. I transferred & restored all of my LPs & singles off vinyl onto CD before these 2 new Classics IV collections came out, and it sounds as good as this. I love ""Nobody Loves You But Me"", but it is obvious that it is off vinyl...or sure sounds like it anyway. If you can live with the quality, it is worth adding to your collection."
3,"Not much to say, really...","Karen Elizabeth Gordon, The Deluxe Transitive Vampire (Pantheon, 1993)Gordon followed up The Well-Tempered Sentence with The Transitive Vampire, so it stood to reason that the tenth-anniversary revision of the first would would be followed by one for the second. And there's nothing terribly new here; once again, sticklers will find a few things to attack, while the rest of the world will be perfectly happy with everything represented here. If you liked the first one, you'll like the second. ***"
5,A book that can turn any student into a lover of grammar!,"A wonderful book to introduce (or brush up on) the rules of grammar without ever forgetting the beauty and playfulness of the language. As a teacher, I owe a debt of thanks to Ms. Gordon and her gothic cast of characters in the _The Deluxe Transitive Vampire_ for giving me a text will help me to show my students the heights that their writing can achieve.Chris Lehmann"
3,Very Strange,"If you are looking for a typical grammar book, this isn't it. Some of the grammar lessons get lost in Ms. Gordon's desire to be bizarre. The clip art is ghoulish and not very well done. Comparing this book to some of the recent offerings of books on grammar, it is definetly more entertaining at least. I was more amused than I was in any English class I ever slept through. As a basic primer for fundamental parts of English, it is simple enough to be a good review for those of us who have been out of school for several years. I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking to polish up their business grammar but it is useful for something to do on a rainy Saturday... in Transylvania..."
4,It entertains as it educates,"This is a story like grammar book and it does not give its audiences any pressure or pain while learning. The author has given bizarre and quirky, but interesting and unforgettable examples. Also, she has put on beautiful drawings at the margin to match her examples. She uses brief explanation to clearly explain her examples."
5,Grammer Basics,It's a great book for reviewing grammer basics. Lots of examples. Easy to understand. Drawings are nifty. Entertaining and helpful.
5,C.O.C.,"I don't care what ANYONE says, this is one of my FAVORITE GWAR CDs. They go out on a different path on this one, and it's a good change. The songs are catchy and cool. It's a very creative album. Some GWAR fans think everything has to be heavy, heavy, heavy. Heavy isn't everything. This album has heavy moments, but for the most part, it's a great rock/punk concept album."
4,Odd......Even For Gwar,"This is usually looked at as Gwar's worst album, or one of them at least. Sure, they strayed from the metal sound we've gotten used to up to this point and decided to play up the humor angle and experiment with different styles. The metal's still here, but it's not constant and sometimes it's mixed with other music styles. Basically Gwar have done what Helloween did with Pink Bubbles Go Ape and Chameleon. I personally like this experimentation. Not every song is a winner of course. This is probably Gwar's longest cd, running over an hour, so you know not all 18 tracks can be winners. You'll actually be a bit surprised by how good some of the songs here are. In fact, I'd have to say some of Gwar's best songs can be found here. It's worth checking out. Gwar have since gone back to the metal sound that they're known for, but it's interesting to hear this musical detour along with We Kill Everything, which also is a bit different for them as well."
5,I LOVE THESE GUYS!,"GWAR kicks it again and does a damn good job doing it! This is Gwar at their best. This CD is right up their with ""America must be destroyed"" and ""Scumdogs"" It's a definate ""must have"" for any GWAR fan or for anyone looking for an Excellent CD."
3,A mix of good and bad GWAR,"GWAR was the first band i ever really got in to. THis album has some good songs mainly HATE LOVE SONGS, Back to IRAQ, GONNA KILL YOU,and BILLY BADDASS. Though there are some weak songs on this disc its not there worst album (Hell-O is there worst). Its too bad they couldnt match the musical masterpiece of RAGNAROK witch is arguably there best album. So i would definately recommend this cd if your a GWAR fan , cause if you dont like them youll hate this album."
2,O...k....,"I know Gwar was being sarcastic and silly but this is pretty unlistenable. Its just, bad. Back to Iraq, Sex Cow, Pain of Techno Destructo and Gonna Kill U are the ONLY good songs on this album. And they're not even good songs either, besides Gonna Kill U,I can't believe how bad this is. I can't believe Gwar did this. Not even Slymenstra's lounge lizardish tune at the end can save this album and she is a great singer.Atrociously dumb album thats not even vile or disgusting that Gwar is best at. Get this album only after you have got the other ones.Their newest album is awesome, go buy it."
1,Worst Gwar Album,"This is the worst Gwar Album. There is only one good song and the rest are average, annoying, or worse. It just sounds like their just messing around and trying to fill up an album. Buy any other gwar album but this one."
2,Skip the albums...but attend the shows!,"I went and seen Gwar in November, and it was an awesome show, especially when they brought in George Bush Jr on stage, disemboweling him before the song ""You Cant Kill Terror""you will get wet by the way!their albums are nothing to scream about..very straight forward rock music...I would be embarrased to listen to this in publick...I mean, seriously...would you listen to the song ""Sex Cow"" while cruising in your car?so, skip their albums, but do go to their shows, they are a blast"
2,Mediocre Game,"I can not figure out why people think this game is so great. I played the original halflife years ago and I thought it was ok, just ok. It has cheezy monsters, the graphics are outdated, game play is mediocre in my opinion. The controls do not work as smoothly as most games. I started playing opposing forces and I just can not get into it. A lot of the puzzles are illogical. With all the other games out today, I feel I wasted my money on this, even though there are five games included. So if you want an outdated mediocre game get this. I have played return to castle wolfenstein about 50 times, I am playing right now as matter of a fact and I still like playing it better than anything in halflife platinum. Maybe the halflife online games are good, I don't know I don't play games online. There you have it."
1,why so popular?,"I really didn't like this game, shoddy ai, blocky gfx, just a bad game all together."
2,DON'T BUY,"This is a horrible game...half life 1 is s*%t! half life 2 is good, buy that. the graphics suck and the storyline and actual game is not fun to play"
5,The Kobayashi Report,"I didn't really get this edition at all. But I do have the games inside of it. What I got is the 2006 Christmas Bundle on my birthday in 2008. I got Blue Shift, and Opposing Force at a later time. But all the same all of these games are really nice."
3,rewritten but lacking :(,"I'm a huge Jeffery Deaver fan however, this book lacked his usual excitement and suspense....I know he wrote it a long time ago and then rewrote it but it is still lacking the usual Jeffery Deaver touch I expected ...."
3,Not gripping,"I usually can't put Jeffrey Deaver's books down, but this one was, although entertaining, was not a page turner - so I was a bit disappointed."
4,Not the very best Deaver,I love everything Jeffery Deaver writes. This is not the best of Deaver but it was a good read with the usual twists and details.
3,Read his other novels first,"Deaver is a great author but he hadn't yet hit his stride with this one. It lacks things that are abundant in his other novels ... believability, humor, page turning compulsion. In Mistress of Justice, the characters have no talent or history for the amateur detective work they undertake....just lots of spunk and luck (and absence of contemporary corporate security provisions.)"
2,You'll need to take notes...,"Deaver's plot in Mistress of Justice is very elaborate and chaotic. The finger is pointed at so many people and there is so much going on that I struggled to keep track. If part of the fun for you is figuring out ""whodunit"", I suggest taking notes right from the start. Even with notes, I think only the very astute reader will figure out the real culprit."
1,Not up to Deaver's normal work,"This book is nowhere near as good as Deaver's other work, before or after this novel. The ""goings on"" at the lawfirm are too exaggerated to make the story believable. Rather than serious fiction, it seemed more like bad comedy at times. Read one of Deaver's other novels for a treat, but skip this one."
4,J D. Another excellent read. Thank you,Clever. Edge of the seat read. As usual Mr. Deaver never fails to keep me reading. Already on to another one.
4,tension packed thriller,"set in steamy key largo, this movie is a tension packed thriller. awesome acting performances by bogart, bacall, robinson and barrymore. a must see for classic film lovers. I highly recommend this film."
4,Talk about something...anything!,"As the storm rages outside, Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) demands that one of his flunkies ""talk about something...anything!"" So, one says, ""Say, I bet you in a couple of years we get back Prohibition. Only this time, it'll work. Yeah, the gangs will all be together this time. Right?"" No response, and the storm doesn't stop. Again, ""Say, I bet in a couple of years we get Prohibition back. Only this time, it'll work."" Great cast (Bogie, Bacall, Barrymore, Robinson, Trevor, and lots of nameless but not faceless character actors). Not the greatest story, but filled with memorable scenes. They don't make them like this anymore."
4,Bogart Entertains With Bacall and Robinson,This well known films stars three of the greatest names from the golden age of Hollywood. If you enjoy movies you have already seen this movie and know you will enjoy seeing it again.
4,sweltering film noir classic,"KEY LARGO sits right beside THE BIG SLEEP as a very entertaining film noir classic. It features Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in one of their most memorable pairings.Based on the play by Maxwell Anderson, KEY LARGO tells the story of ex-GI Frank McCloud (Bogart) who travels to a hotel in Key Largo owned by his old army buddy's widow Nora Temple (Bacall) and her crippled father-in-law (Lionel Barrymore). Also staying at the hotel is notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), his cronies and his good-hearted moll (Claire Trevor).As Johnny holds Frank and Nora hostage in the hotel, a vicious storm rages outside, rivalled only by the storm of passions and tempers inside the hotel at Key Largo.Claire Trevor won a well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress here. Her heartbreaking performance includes singing the song ""Moanin' Low"".The DVD includes the trailer."
4,Steller Perfomances,No slouch acting in this film.With Bogie playing a reluctant andcynical hero and Claire Trevor giving a well earned oscarperformance you can't miss.We even get to see Jay Silverheelsbefore his Lone Ranger days.Though Becall's performance is notquite up to what one might expect it is more than made up forby the rest of this star studded cast.
4,not up there with Casablanca,"nor the Big Sleep, but a pretty good movie. Bacall and Bogie seemed a little flat, but the rest of the cast made up for it. Edgar G. Robinson was great."
1,don't buy this,i tried to watch this movie and all i got was volume. no picture. do not recommend that you buy it. bad technology
4,A classic movie,Key Largo is classic entertainment but why not give us the option of the computer-colored version which I think is a huge improvement.Both versions could be fitted onto the DVD.The color version makes the movie look much clearer and they have done a very good job on it.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A movie that feels limited when it should feel claustrophobic, Key Largo has an undeserved reputation of a classic when in fact it's one of Huston's weaker films; with a predictable climax and an uninspired turn by Bogey, it's not a film you should prioritize in your Netflix queue."
3,Not one of Bogart's better films,"It has its moments, but this particular movie is substandard compared to Bogart's other films. The acting is not particularly good and the dialogue isn't clever either. It is mostly cheap melodrama punctuated by a few exciting moments. Unless you are a major fan of Bogart or Bacall I would recommend avoiding this one."
5,"""One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for.""","Edward G. Robinson is the tough guy gangster Rocco who holds a group of people, including Bogart, Bacall, and Lionel Barrymore, captive in a hotel on Key Largo while a hurricane roars outside. Bogie is in his patented role of the guy who just wants to be left alone until finally his conscience is stirred enough to take action. It's especially noteworthy that Barrymore, the only one who stands up to Robinson in the early going, is confined to a wheelchair. Robinson is particularly sadistic in his treatment of people and is the standout performer in the picture. Claire Trevor is also very fine in her role as Robinson's alcoholic girlfriend (she won an Oscar for best supporting actress). All in all, an excellent crime drama that keeps us interested in watching all the way through."
5,OLD MEMORIES,I LIVED IN SUMMERLAND KEY FLORIDA - THIS VIDEO BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN - I'M GOING BACK TO LITTLE PALM ISLAND THIS SUMMER - THE DVD WAS EXCELLENT - THE BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO WAS SO CLEAR AND BRIGHT - IT LOOK LIKE IT WAS JUST PRODUCED.
1,Dome Magnifier,It was not the quality I was looking for and the price was way over priced. I got a 10X magnifier at a local hardware store for under $5.00.
5,Best fragrance-free and sulfite free shaving lotion,"We really like it, goes on like soap, but a little thicker so it is easy to shave with either a razor or an electric. Washes clean."
3,Textbook for student,"A light-weighted text book for students taking IR model class. Practitioner's lauguage for bond paying coupon every six month is ""semi-annually"", not half-yearly. Read those classic term structure papers may help more than this book."
4,Innovative blues,"I initially heard one cut ""Sacred Ground"" on a local NPR station at the end of a long day on the road. Even after 400+ miles ""Sacred Ground"" had me tapping my steering wheel and wanting to play the cut multiple times to pin down the words.The album carries on the joys of ""Sacred Ground"" - simple and direct lyrics, a raw voice with great musicality, acoustical bass and drums supporting an electric guitar, traditional blues with syncopation,... What Mooney does best is carry on a blues tradition while innovating within its constraints.My only complaint is the similarity between several of the cuts - as creative an artist as John Mooney could surely modify his sound sufficently to give a distinctive touch to each song."
3,Not Very Comprehensive,"I was hoping this would be a more thorough listing of mountain biking areas in the Great Lake States, but it's not. It sticks to only what it considers to be the classic trails."
2,Okay story; needed better acting and photography,"The story here is okay, but the acting, directing, and photography leave much to be desired. This was clearly made on a shoestring budget, but even at that, there should have been more quality control. If you want a better film about Native Americans, try Smoke Signals or Christmas in the Clouds."
2,Tries hard but doesn't work,"I wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't. The writing, directing, and acting were too sophomoric for me to enjoy. The basic premise was good and very Native American-like (think trickster meets modern Indian) but the writer-director could not pull it off.There are a number of great Indian movies out there that work, and some wonderful must-see artistic beginnings (eg. Fancy Dancing by Sherman Alexie), but this movie falls into neither category. It is great high school material, but nothing more."
1,Worst acting I've seen for a long time!,"Everything about this movie is bad, bad, bad. By far the worst acting I've ever seen. Couldn't wait until the awful thing ended."
2,A fatal change of speed...,"Whow, slow down there, Carl! Are you sure you're accompanying the right band? The strength of the former Fields of the Nephilim lay in their slow, moody, atmospherically dense songs that rose, developed, climaxed, and finally melded seamlessly into the next track. If that is what you liked, you will be terribly disappointed by Zoon. This has got almost nothing to do with their previous work; it is as clean a cut as I have ever heard. While there may be musical merit here that speed- and heavy metal fans could appreciate, this combination of guitar-torturing and 300-bpm-drum-flogging is bound to make the ears of any Fields fan hurt. In needing to keep up with the music, Carl McCoy's voice is sadly reduced to a harsh, low belching sound, typical for other bands of this genre. The one exception is the incredibly beautiful and melodious ""Shine"", which is worth five stars when viewed by itself. If you're a former Fields fan, be sure to listen to this before you buy it."
3,Book Review,The book was just ok cover has been folded in half.Only a few marks in the book. So overall its ok.
2,"Deceiving, if somewhat inspiring.","Although I found parts of Indichova's story inspiring, overall I found this book more annoying than enlightening. Women who are struggling to conceive their first child should be warned before reading this book. Indichova's struggle is about secondary infertility. As someone who is still hoping for one child, I found it difficult to read page after page of Indichova's angst about trying for her second child. It made me feel that she didn't really appreciate the gift and miracle she already had with her first healthy child. I know secondary infertility is a serious problem for many women and I respect that it is, but for women who have not been able to have any children, this book can be an odd and unsettling read."
5,Great read. A wonderful story of alternatives!,"I bought this for my sister-in-law, but since I'm a pregnancy/birth junkie I read it before sending it to her. I think it's a wonderful reminder that western docs do not know everything there is to know about fertility and infertility, but they tend to act like they do and present no alternatives.My sister-in-law just had her first baby a few months ago after 10 years of trying. The few years of Western fertility treatment did not work and she hadn't yet gotten around to the acupuncture I was urging her to get. It happened naturally after they came out to visit my hubby and daughter and me."
2,disappointed,"I am,like most of the readers of the book been trying to conceive for sometime and when I saw the title and read the reviews I thought I'll give this book a try. I don't begrudge the author for wanting another baby even if she already has one and in the early parts of the book it seems OK but when she got into the yoga and the positions that she assumed and most everything else that followed it was just too much for me. I am happy for her for having conceived her second child but the idea or the assumption that if you will yourself to conceive and have some sort of positive imagery and unity with the Universe is more than I can bear. She did have a miraculous birth considering her FSH level but it was the Creator who did that for her and not an act she willed herself to have."
5,A Godsend! It worked for me!,"I?m three months pregnant today (at age 43) and I have this book to thank for giving me hope when everyone around me said ?most unlikely.? To begin with Julia Indichova not only gave me an enormous amount of specific information about how to proceed in the face of all the negativity, the book is so beautifully written, that reading it was for me a transforming experience. I cried and laughed and I read it over and over again especially when I felt discouraged. Of course her pregnancy was a miracle! Every pregnancy is a miracle, but Julia shows the reader who is willing to open her eyes that we can do something to help create miracles in our lives!!! What a lesson that is!!! Bless you, Julia!!!"
1,I threw it across the room when I finished it,"After 4.5 years of infertility and wondering if I will ever be a mother to a live baby I can hold and love, I feel that this book is a slap in the face to all of us undergoing infertility treatment.What Julia does is lend creedence to all those who say ""just relax"" or ""meditate and do yoga"". The quote about not being ""so quick to put your eggs in a petri dish""? Quick? She must be crazy. Who does this without careful consideration?Throughout the whole book she runs from the dreaded IVF. Well, hooray for her if she can get a baby from herbs and relaxation. But, for most of us, that is just not our reality.Especially for people with anatomical abnormalities that no amount of herbage or mediation will fix.Thanks, Julia, for making me feel even *more* broken."
1,How are you CHILDLESS???,"This book is a flop, the woman has had a child. So, she can't possibly feel the pain of a woman who screams and cries out to God, ""Why?! Why can't I have a child, Father?! You know I would be a good mother...probably better than most. Please God, I am on my knees begging for you to answer this yearning desire, this pleading prayer for a child! Father, are you listening?"""
3,"Good but not a ""how to"" book by any means","As someone with many fertility problems myself and still no baby, i really identified with some of the things in the book. Since she suffered from secondary infertility and already had a baby at home, I couldn't identify with her completely. I think this is definitely a memoir and not a ""how to"" book on getting pregnant. She does say that in the book, that her method is completely her own and it won't work for everyone. The only thing I didn't like about the book was her unfortunate experiences with holistic practitioners, I realize it was just her experience but she made it sound like most people practicing ancient and holistic arts are crooks. I found myself happy she was able to add to her family but overall I didn't feel like the book did much for me as a woman in my 20's with PCOS. If you are suffering from secondary infertility and/or high FSH numbers then this book is for you."
4,Good read,I read a lot of infertility books and enjoy reading personal sagas about infertility - -particularly success stories like this one. It gave me hope and made me realize how much we need to take charge of our health. I would like know more about what happens next!
2,Skip it.....,"This book is terrible. While she discusses some excellent topics like diet, relaxation and taking control of your own health, it's at a 50,000 foot level, there is no real factual information whatsoever. And unless you have endless time and money to pursue treatments you are not going to be able to follow in her footsteps. Save your money ladies!"
2,Thirty-something,"I wanted someone to connect with, someone who's been where I have, I suppose. While I felt for her and her husband, it's just her situation which didn't match with mine. I thought I would be reading about someone who went through IUIs, IUIs with meds and IVF cycles.The author is much older than me and has a specific situation with FSH levels. For most of us women in our thirties that's a non issue.The healthy diet and nutritional information sparked my interest however I still believe everything in moderation is key.If you're on a journey where male infertility is an issue or your on the IVF path, this is not for you."
3,Not as helpful as I'd hoped,"I agree with the other reviews that Julia's story is compelling and well-told. I expected to read an inspirational story that would be relevant to my situation (ttc 1+ yrs). I have normal FSH levels, and we will be starting AI, hoping we don't have to proceed beyond that into other techniques not covered by my insurance. Julia's FSH levels were elevated, which is why she was told she wasn't a good candidate. If you also have elevated FSH, this book may provide more inspiration to you than it did to me. If your FSH is normal, this story probably won't help you that much."
2,Well written but was not as good as I had hoped,I have been struggling to conceive for over two years. I ordered this book thinking that there was some mystery cure that she had found on her path for a baby. The beginning was great and I could relate to her struggles to have a baby. For those of us who struggle just to have one miracle she was complaining about her situation when she already had one child very easily. She didn't start having children until her late thirties/ early forties. If you want to read her suggestions about fertility check it out from the library.
3,"Nothing unexpected,,,","If you don't know anything about infertility this book will give you an idea what those families go true. Otherwise, we all know what options we have,,,Did it gave me more hope - no! We all are different, we all have different finance limits, we live in different towns,,,and finally - the author already has a child so I don't think she would know the pain childless families go true.To bad I spill smt on my book so I can't resell it (pages got wrinkled)...If someone interested, can give it for free just pay the shipping."
4,"Powerful and vivid, personal, and to the point.","This is the book that youth groups should mass order. Peretti recounts his own childhood growing up as a victim of both cystic hygroma (causing stunted growth and a speech impediment, among other problems) and bullying. He shares with painful detail how constant bullying effected his self-image (""I thought I was a monster"") and how the school system typically does little or nothing to protect the weak. Even further, he illustrates his view of the world as governed by a higher system of rules, explaining why ""Might makes right"" is both a dangerous and a flawed philosophy. Peretti even confesses his own faults as an occasional bully, his failures to stick up for those weaker than himself. This is a super-quick read that will challenge adults to a new awareness of the bullying problem and will benefit every teen/pre-teen reader, whether he is a bully, a victim, or someone caught in the middle who doesn't know how to change ""the way things are."""
4,No More Victims,"I liked this story, because Frank is one of my favorite Christian writers, and it was kind of an introduction into his life and why he thinks and relates to people."
5,abridged for teens from The Wounded Spirit,"No More Victims is an abridged version of The Wounded Spirit meant for tweens. Both are powerful non-fiction books about the need to take a stand against bullying, based on his on experience as a child. Excellent writing, important topic well covered. In a very personal, vulnerable, readable style, he deals with important topics in this context, such as why God allows suffering. For good readers over 15, I'd recommend The Wounded Spirit instead."
4,Damn Good,"The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because not EVERY song is good, and on top of that, it took me about 2 months to like this cd. I dont exactly know why i didn't like this at first, but now that I've opened up, it's definitely some bad@$$ hard music. Great, Lean On You, Are You Happy?, Breakdown are the best songs. The wierd thing is the vocalist can go from having a great hard singing voice to a slightly annoying high pitched screams at certain points in almost every song. Never seen someone with such a good voice try and kill it by screamin like a girl, but oh well, if you can get past that you'll love this cd."
1,Selling themselves short,"With the line up that this band boasts, I was seriously disappointed with this record. Everything from the lyrics to the chord progressions to the hooks and choruses scream ""play me on the radio"".Im not as surprised that Artie Shepard from Errortype:11 had a hand in this as I was to see Tom Capone and Joe Grillo's named as co conspirators.While I am in no way going to judge the motives of the band,as everyone is entitled to live off their tunes if they are presented with the opportunity and if they want to ape carbon copy bands like Sevendust or Godsmack ,then so be it.But fans of any of the members previous bands would be well advised to not be duped into buying this."
3,Not as good as Slayer but...,"Good nontheless.Very similar to Slayer actually in some respects, I don't know why anyone would say this is not. Dave Lombardo does a great job on drums (as usual), the guitarist is good too, and the singer's not bad either.Actually, Gus Chambers sounds a lot like Tom Araya on some tracks.I was lucky enough to find this CD at a second hand place. I only listened to two of the songs on the album before buying it, I figured Lombardo's drumming alone would make this a great album.Worth a listen. Fav. song on the album: Pathetic Liar"
2,You get what you pay for,"So far the strainer works fine.It does has a lock out feature that can be irritating when I don't want it ""locked"" but otherwise I have no complaints. Great for the price.Edited to add that I bought two of these strainers and they fell apart with ""normal"" use just a couple months after I bought them.I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Not worth it,Stopper portion eventually unseated from basket. I used a hammer and wrench to tap it back in until I find a replacement. Cheaply assembled product.1/6/11Used some pliers to make the basket grip the stopper more tightly.
3,Good but stinky!,These strainers do the trick and look fine but boy do they have a BAD and STRONG odor to them! The rubber stoppers smell terrible. I hope the smell dies down soon because it's almost too strong to even use them. I can smell it when I get anywhere near my kitchen sink.
1,JUNK!!!,These are very light weight. They also have trouble sealing and the water drains out of the sink. The stopper falls off the stem as well. Total junk.
4,Relentlessly pounds you into submission,"I discovered F&J in '92 when rock radio actually played ""Never To Reveal"" for a couple of times before it was finally shelved forever. The band sounded great and unlike any other metal act. There is a relentlessness in Flotsam's musical approach which gets the point across in no uncertain terms. ""High"" is no exception. From the hauntingly simple opening acoustic guitar on ""Final Step"" to the last sound of a breaking string on ""Everything,"" this album pounds you into submission. The word ""vicious"" comes to mind. The band's performance is of the highest caliber and the recording captures it quite convincingly. My favorite song is ""High Noon"" which Megadeth would kill to write these days (Crush 'em, indeed). And just to show that these guys have a sense of humor, the lettering of the song titles on the back cover captures the logo styles of bands as diverse as Maiden, Priest and Van Halen, among others. Very highly recommended..."
1,Two good songs and a barrage of below average garbage.,High Noon and It's on Me.....thats it. Plus a cover from a good band Forkboy (Lard). Yet another below average album from this below average band.
5,Flotsam and Jetsam will never die!,"An awesome album by an awesome band.I have been a fan and supporter of this awesome Metal band since the late 80's and all through the 90's and post 2K.It is a shame that such a classic, creative Metal band doesn't get air play and garbage from Nu Metal, rap metal, emo and other mediocre human cest does.I have seen these guys live on many occasions and they always deliver. From Doomsday for the Deceiver to High, Flotsam and Jetsam has been one of my favorite metal acts and this album blew me away. I took a chance because I never heard it on the air but I am glad my gamble paid off as I have just added another superb piece of Metallic creativity to my collection. You owe it to yourself to own ""High""!"
5,Good quaily for the price,"I purchased this duvet cover along with the sheet set, I washed them first no shrinkage and they cover my pillow top mattress. I purchased some comforter clips which makes my down comforter stay in place inside the duvet."
3,Great. Who would pay $6.99 plus shipping for something that costs less than 50 cents?,Great cheap soda. Worth every penny of the $.47 cents that it costs. Not worth $6.99 plus shipping.
1,"no, no, no","while this is the best soda ever made, this is WAAAAY too much for one 2-liter when on faygos site you can get 8 for almost the same price"
2,Not mercy mission.,This is a rated R martial arts movie. I thought it might be a Christian movie and so took a chance. When I saw what it was and read its description on the back I threw it in the trash. It is also not mercy mission which is what someone else seems to have reviewed.
2,ok for the price,"The robe is inexpensive and ok for the price. The material was cut the wrong way so it is not soft and smooth to the touch. Not bad workmanship, tho. Suits my purpose."
2,long velour lounger,"The material this robe was made from did not meet my expectations. The robe looked great, but it was not soft nor well made."
1,CHEAP PIECE OF CRAP. LINT STICKS TO IT AND I CANNOT PULL IT ALL OFF -- YUCKY - I THREW IT IN THE TRASH.,"The robe was nasty/awful because it was not warm at all,very thin and picked up so much lint/fuzzies that were impossible to get off of it. Recommend going to LL bean and getting the same lounger that will keep you warm as soon as you put in on. Never returned it, just threw it out.Sincerely, Bridget"
1,wrong item,"They sent the wrong item, wrong color and wrong size. and was told that they couldn't send a replaced by Christmas, unless I pay for overnight. I thought since it was their mistake I shouldnot have to pay anything. Item was returned . Will not recommend this company."
3,Good for the Price,"The color is pretty and it works as a robe. The fabric is a bit flimsy, but good enough for the price."
1,velour bathrobe,i bought this for my mother for a late xmas present. it is early february and i am returning it. she washed it and every little bit of lint and fuzz stuck to it and she says it is very thin. it is a beautiful shade of green.
2,"Very pretty, but way to thin!!","Color was great but if you need warmth, don't buy this. Polyester is thin and felt like ice on my legs!!!"
3,Looks Nice,These look nice and for the money are ok but they are not as plush and comfy as I would have liked.
2,Not very good quality.,"For a velour lounger, this fabric feels very thin and cheap. I am very disappointed in the quality. Also the color is much darker than pictured online. I do not think they will hold up very well."
2,Returned this item,The material is very thin and flimsy and the nap of the velour goes in the wrong direction thus making it feel rough when you run your hand over the material. I sent the robe back and asked for my money back.
1,You've got to be kidding,"This is probably the worst music I've heard in my life, and I've heard some bad stuff in almost 1/2 a century -- altho way more good - great - incredible! than bad. I'm embarrassed for his incredibly talented father."
3,Field recordings from Francophone Central and West Africa,"Field recordings from Francophone Central and West Africa. Strengths: a fair amount of diversity -- the recording locales range from Algeria to the Congo, so there is a lot of stylistic variety. (Special award for authenticity: during the ""Danse Touareg"" recorded in the Sahara, a huge gust of wind comes along and makes this screeching static sound in the mike.) Weakness: its pretty scattershot - not a lot of coherence. The accompanying booklet is in both French and English, not particularly informative, tends toward the ""noble savage"" school of romanticism."
5,WWII history,"I am reading this whole series of books and they are very good. I love history and can't get enough of it. I have found that non-fiction is much more interesting than fiction, and I love biographies and auto-biographies."
2,Searching for the REMOTE!!!,"The Searchers took no time at all to put me in search of the channel-changer. It was not even REMOTELY good. Yes it was 1956 and, yes, those were the days... I get that, but you cannot be serious!!!Trying to watch this movie, after seeing any good movie these days, for instance 2007 No Country For Old Men, or 2010 True Grit, or even 1990 DWWolves...and you just can't!"
3,Typical John Wayne western adventure,"Nothing special. Just a trip down memory lane of the entertainment I enjoyed while growing up in the 950's, 1960's and 1970's."
5,wow!,"This is an amazing movie. Certainly it is one of John Wayne's best. I agree with another reviewer that the scene where he tells of Lucy's death is very well done. It ranks right up there with the scene when he quotes a poem at the funeral for some of his men in ""They Were Expendable."" He was definitely one of the greatest actors of all time. I may be far-fetched, but does anyone else share my hypothesis that Martin is Ethan's son? This is a very fascinating movie!"
4,somewhat forgotten legend,"this great film is often disregarded and is given secondary priority to other films of this genre.John Wayne gives one of his greatest performances as ""Ethan Edwards"", a role he often referred to as his most favorite. the basic premise of the film is simple but engrossing enough to maintain the viewer's attention. ""Ethan's"" two neices are kidnapped by savage indians after the indians slaughter their parents. ""Ethan Edwards"" goes after the indians who did it. to divulge any more of this great plot would insane.this one should definitely be regarded as one of the great westerns in motion picture history. it is indeed one the the true legends.as for the DVD, it has excellent sound, good picture and ample extra features including a 3 part documentary on the making of the picture. it also has a theatrical trailer, production notes and cast bios. any avid western fan should have include it in his DVD library."
5,Outstanding hi-def version of an outstanding film.,"""The Searchers"" ranks with the finest films of the twentieth century, and of course with John Ford's very best westerns. This Blu-Ray disc is the best home video version yet. The hi-def transfer is extraordinary, and very close to the 35mm print version I saw when the film was restored and re-released in the early 90s. Color, sharpness, and picture stability are right on the money.If you love American film, don't miss this disc."
2,Wayne's acting is so wooden......,I have never been a John Wayne fan and I am surprised that this movie has gotten so many high praise reviews. I think it runs too long and the actors in it led by Wayne are all pretty much wooden. There is no humanity here at all.
2,searching for WHAT???,"I couldn't get into this movie. It was plain bad. I wanted to like it, but even John Wayne couldn't save this movie in my eyes. Pass on this one. Not for women, that's for sure."
4,Great picture quality. Very good film.,The picture quality is amazing for a film of its age. A very well done HD-DVD release.
5,The Greatest Western of all time!!!,"THE TIME: Shortly after the Civil War THE PLACE: Texas THE GOOD NEWS: The Commanchees raided a ranch,murdered a family and took a young girl captive. THE BAD NEWS: She was the Duke's neice.So begins John Ford's epic saga of Family Honor, Western style.John Wayne and Jeffery Hunter spend 5 years searching,finding and bringing home Natalia Wood.The last scene, with the Duke, framed in the doorway, his back to the camera; holding his right elbow with his left hand, which was a tribute to the great Harry Carey Sr.; brought his widow, Olive Carey(Mrs. Jorgenson) to tears.Ford,Wayne,Western: always a winning combination!!!"
4,"Great Release, but save your money","This Ultimate Collectors Edition is a fine release, however, there was also a two disc special edition released in conjunction with the Ultimate edition. Both Versions, in terms of special features, are the same. The only thing the Ultimate has that the two disc doesn't are production photo's,a comic of the Searchers, and production notes from the films director, John Ford. So if you want to save yourself some money, and get an almost identical product, purchace the two disc special, if you want the prestige of owning the Ultimate Edition(recomended for die-hard fans)go ahead and spend the extra money."
4,best John Wayne and John Ford Western,"Although I am not a big John Wayne fan, this is a movie that I can watch every couple of years. I bought the bluray for my Dad who just got a new bluray player. He grew up in Southern Utah where many of these type of films were shot, and he likes these type of movies. While John Wayne's acting style isn't the best or most believable and the main Native American characters look like Caucasian actors in make up, if your a movie buff, you should see this at least once. Some of the supporting characters are very amusing as well."
3,Well-shot but overrated,"The Bottom Line:The Searchers is universally beloved, but the people who heap gallons of praise on it seem to have ignored the terribly boring and unnecessary subplot involving Vera Miles & Jeffrey Hunter, the general slow pace of the film, and the overboiled performances by basically everyone other than Wayne; some of the themes are interesting enough, but as a film The Searchers leaves a lot to be desired.2.5/4"
3,Definitely NOT as good many other Westerns,"It is difficult to enjoy a film with so many inaccuracies in time and place. Texas looks NOTHING like the Monument Valley of Utah, where this was shot. All of the characters are using 1892 Winchesters** and Colt Single Action metallic cartridge revolvers*** which were not manufactured until **1892 and ***1873, respectively. The idea that our ""?HERO?"" wants to kill an innocent white girl simply because she was captured by, and is living with, Indians is not believable. There are many other Westerns with better stories and acting, such as: Treasure of the Sierra Madre, True Grit, The Unforgiven, The Missouri Breaks, etc. . Why some people consider John Wayne (the person) as a Hero is baffling as he did nothing heroic in his entire Real-life."
2,"John Ford, the Mediocrity","""The Searchers,"" for some unforeseen and godforsaken reason, is constantly extolled as the foremost example of John Ford's cinematic genius. I saw the film, and I searched and I searched, until I could find no genius at all. Only a conventional, hackneyed Western [pleonasm?], based on actual historical events, melodramatically told - even obscuring or distorting the actual events - just so John Ford could tell his rather silly story of how poor Ethan was left out of the Family Reunion (the completely symbolic closing door in the final shot). Many filmmakers have revered this film. But then, most filmmakers were never noted for their taste (even Kurosawa admired Ford). If this were a nickelodeon, I'd advise you to save your nickels."
1,Searching for what all the fuss is about,"Almost everybody, it seems, thinks this is a masterpiece. Quite frankly, I cannot see why. I won't bother with how Native Americans are stereotyped, although, from today's understanding, the movie really gives you a hard time sitting through their comic strip-like portrayal. My main critique is that the characters development is weak. Secondary characters are stereotyped to such a degree that makes the movie almost unbearable. At the end Wayne's sudden decision not to kill the girl doesn't really surprises anybody, after all this is Hollywood. But why has he changed his mind? We do not know. What has he learned? The way that he stagers of into the sunset in the movie's final scene suggests that he hasn't learned much. He leaves because he is still uncap able of being ""social"". Maybe this movie ""stood tall"" in the 1950s, as one reviewer suggested, but it's definitely not a must see classic."
1,I gave up when..,the indians show up and the one who is apparently to grab the little girl is obviously a white guy with utterly lame 'indian' makeup on. I just can't stand this kind of crap. It's what makes so many of these old westerns unwatchable. Plus the comic relief 'old guy' is pitiful.
1,almost a waste of time,Except for the scenery this outdated film and story is almost a waste of time to watch.
4,"Movie is a classic, blu ray treatment of it doesn't add much","I have always loved John Wayne movies,and considered ""The Searchers"" to be one of the best. My opinion of that remains unchanged, however, I didn't see much different between the standard DVD version and the blu ray version of this movie. My TV, TV cables, and blu ray player are all top of the line and I have watched other blu ray discs on it and have been wowed by the detail and clarity. This movie didn't really offer much more then the standard DVD version. It's only priced a few more dollars above the standard DVD so its not that much of a risk and if you want the newest version of this movie, you will have it, but if you want to save a few bucks and get the same quality picture just go with the Standard DVD version. I don't think this is anyone's fault, I just think that the movie technology of the 1950's doesn't convert well to Blu ray, but thats just one guys opinion. Either way the movie is excellent."
5,Christmas gift,I bought this for my 30 yearl old son. as a boy it was his fav movie.. he would watch it over and over
4,John Wayne,"I enjoy Wayne's movies but not all of them. The Searchers is one of my favorites. As usual JW fills the screen with his very presence. He is a late returning home confederate soldier with some unresolved personal issues. Gruff, rough, seldom gentle and, always in command. Once home JW still fights his inner demons as well as outer demons i.e. family, religion, indians, mixed ""breeds."" The story revolves around these core beliefs of Wayne's. The cintamatography is well done although typical of how the southwest is usually portrayed. Ward Bond plays a rather 'odd' character but, he does so well. A marriage, fight scene, and party (hoe-down) are all tossed together like a strangely mixed salad, for comic relief, which, I found silly and sophomoric. The movie covers a number of years and 'aging' of the characters is not well managed by the make up department or the director. However, overall the movie is entertaining and, if one is a John Wayne fan a must for your collection."
3,A visual masterpiece,"The Searchers is as much a visual masterpiece as it is a work of story-telling art. A classic John Wayne, John Huston team up that's as interesting just to look at as it is to follow.If you're looking for a lot of extras on this DVD, you won't find them here. Picture and sound are high-quality, though, and do justice to this artsy-looking masterpiece. A good solid addition to any DVD collection."
4,The Searchers,"Viewing quality seems to be sat. Delivery time was good. CD case however is thin card board with Chinese writing. I can only hope this is not a ""boot leg"" copy. This was a used CD listed as band new unopened. Maybe its just my opinion, but I was disappointed to buy a classic CD of the Duke which was covered with orietal writing. Next time i'll buy new."
2,Moving listings - general,"As a HOH (Hard of Hearing) Individual, I need to know if thismovie is captioned (marked ""CC"" or ""Q."""
2,ok movie,"I liked the music, the nature was amazing - love watching the nature in these western moviesJohn Wayne's a great actor but the attitude he stands for is spoiled. George W Bush ruining of the cowboy image was one of the damages he made and Wayne characterizing the obstinate bully mentality that Bush took was not pleasant to see. I always liked Wayne but having seen this movie I see that while he's still a good guy and I like him, the cowboy mentality as exhibited by Bush is bankrupt. Also I didn't like the spirit of the movie which constantly had conflict as part of it - obviously all these characters were in conflict w/ themselves else they'd know a more peaceful way of relating (not talking about komancho vs white but just between and within whites too)"
4,Great Movie!,"This is a great movie. However this movie has a lot of age on it (1956) so the acting, like in all movies of this time, is simply carried out in a different approach. Once you get passed this you can really appreciate the movie.What really blows you away, is the picture quality of this BD...absolutely beautiful!! Hard to believe it debuted 52 years ago.Keith, Macon, GA"
4,The work of a master,"John Ford is an inventive director. This is, without a doubt, true from every shot in 'the Searchers'. The details of the film are extraordinary, and you can see why Orson Welles was so enthralled by the man and his movies.John Wayne is very aptly cast in this - probably his best film.What grabs me the most is the epic style of the photography - the play of light and color - which must have been so exciting to see when the film came out.My perspective as a viewer in 2005 is what brings this one down to 4 stars for me (a personal decision). Although I see this film as a classic, even a masterpiece, I just cannot bare some of the racism that comes out at times.. I try to filter out this aspect - I mean all film is a product of its time and place - but my own personal perspective is very hard to shake. This does not take away from the very obvious brilliance that I do see in this film, however, and the genius of John Ford does shine through."
3,about the widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio&#65533;,"The searchers is one of the most important movie never made but i'm verry desapointed. This dvd present a standard version and wildescreen version. But it's not the unbelievibal original theatrical exhibition (the largest scope you can imagine, more or less 2,5: 1. You can see it on CD Video). This present DVD's Wildscreenn version is just a standard version including two black lines... An incrédible letter box presentation... Un film comme a méritait plus de respect (in french !) and I'm always waiting for a real good dvd edition of this great part of american art ! (Excuse my very bad english... I'm french !)"
5,Raging Duke!,"If you liked John Wayne in ""True Grit"", you will love him in ""The Searchers"". He is maniacal and raging throughout. Still angry with the wars outcome (He was a Confederate soldier), he comes home and finds a new enemy when his relatives are slaughtered and/or kidnapped. Natalie Woods is a bit too good looking as the teenaged kidnapped girl, Debbie. Interestingly, the pre-kidnapping Debbie is played by her younger sister, Lana. Definitely not a PC movie. The Commanches are shown as pure evil. But mainly it is the leader, Scar, who is the real bad guy although the Duke is rather bad at times as well."
5,The Searchers with John Wayne,This is one of the best Western movies ever made! I have watched it probably 20 times. Outstanding. Don't miss it.
5,It don't get no better than this.,I first viewed this film on TV when I was about fourteen years old and it has mesmerized me ever since. IMHO this is the greatest motion picture ever made.
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I've avoided this movie for years, but I was plasantly surprised when I finally viewed it. Most people talk about the complexity of John Wayne's character, but I disagree. I feel he wasn't complex at all.... just a cut and dried racist. Near the end of the movie he did become a little complex, but I think it was just a matter of conscience. What I really liked about the movie was the storyline and the scenery. ONe of my favorite movies is The Color Purple and there were scenes in The Searchers that I'm almost certain Speilberg had to have copied for the Color Purple. Especially the shot of the family on the porch at the beginning of the movie. It was so reminiscent of one of the final scenes in the Color Purple."
4,the searchers,"Although John Ford's film the Searchers is considered by many to be a classic,and although it is a good film, I don't think it is the best John Wayne movie ever made. It does not surpass John Wayne's film, the Alamo, in any way, shape or form. I personally think the Searchers is an overrated film in the same way the film High Noon is. It's almost as if people in our society have no original opinions of their own. Classic films in our society should be weighted by their emotional impact, and not by what a critic may say. And that is the case with both the Searchers and High Noon. Films that I consider to be epics are: the Alamo, Braveheart, the Kingdom of Heaven."
4,Relentless Pursuit,"The Searchers is probably one of the most analyzed Westerns ever made, so I'm not going to attempt to look at its deeper meaning. From a purely entertainment point of view, the movie works very well. John Wayne is excellent as the tough, driven uncle of Natalie Wood, who goes on a 5 year quest to find her after her family is murdered and she is kidnapped by Indians. Two things about this film standout for me. One thing is the relentless pursuit by Wayne and the way one man, for whatever his motives, refuses to give up or move on without getting what he is after. The other standout is the photography. This must be one of the most beautifully filmed movies of all time. The colour and scenery are breathtaking. Some of the dialogue and acting (especially Jeffrey Hunter) are stilted and unbelievable, but they do not interfere in the enjoyment of the movie. Anyone in ""search"" of a great, classic Western should be sure to view this movie."
5,Wayne and Ford,"Probably the Duke's greatest film. A large scale epic of a quest by Ford with Wayne tracking his lost niece -- after Indians raid her home and kill her family. Aided by Jeffrey Hunter, this a truly monumental motion picture and not simply one of the greatest westerns ever made. Wayne's character is a man who truly loses everything -- best exemplified by the final scene."
5,The Searchers,The Searchers [Blu-ray]this is by far the best quality Blu-ray dvd that i have seen yet.the picture seems like you are standing on the set along with theactors....especially the exterior shots. i highly suggest thatanyone with high def television purchase this item.
4,"Great film, mediocre DVD","Given the stature of this film, one would expect a better quality DVD. I can only hope that one will soon be made available. This is perhaps the greatest Western of all time. Wayne turns in his most compelling performance as the lone wolf, Ethan, forced to confront an old Indian nemesis, Scar. Ford sets Wayne against the backdrop of Monument Valley, as Ethan tracks down a teenage girl (Natalie Wood) who had been abducted by Scar. The film can be a little uneven but it tells a very intriguing story. Ford confronts racism and feelings of isolation, steering away for the most part from cliche images of the West. Edward Buscombe has written a fine piece on ""The Searchers"" for BFI Film Classics which is well worth reading as it fills you in on the making of film, offering notes on Ford's epic vision."
4,Australian friends & tequila,"Introduced to this stuff in a haze of pure fun around 2004, absinthia, tequila and yuengling. NEPA mingled with great sounds and friends from down under. Whatta night.. Scientists, Radio Birdman, Celibate Rifles get with it people you cannot go wrong. Some bad production on some stuff but who cares. Over all, a great compilation Thanks Ian&Donna."
4,art for youth,"I checked out this book from the library because, as an adult, I felt I didn't know enough about paintings to appreciate them fully when I visited an art gallery. This book briefly covers a large number of aspects of art including color, perspective, portraits, and landscape. The paintings used as examples are many and varied and they are beautifully reproduced. I learned many things but as I read, I came up with many more questions the book did not answer. However, I am a 36-year-old college graduate. I believe that the book is quite informative for its recommended age group: 9-12. I am getting a copy for my artistic nephew's tenth birthday."
3,Mirror Issues,"The installation of these mirrors was a challenge but was possible after acquiring the proper knuckle extensions for the ratchets used in the process. The left side mirror has a different range of motion than the right side mirror does. There also is no way to secure the right side mirror in a particular position, which is necessary to see around the sides of our stake truck. I don't know if I'm missing something here but the right side is useless unless I can get it to stay in a position in between the full and minimum stop positions. And I don't see any opportunity to adjust this range. Unfortunately, I'm not happy and am looking for a way to return the right side thinking it is defective for the reasons mentions above."
4,Extendable mirrors,"Great product, well made too. But... They do not fold flat if something hits them. I have the motorized ones, and they just dont seem to go as low as the stock ones. I have a Dually, and I can not see the rear wheels. I wish they had an option to add the turn signal lights, as there is an area where they would go. Great rear view compared to the stock mirrors!"
1,"Rip-off Alert!!! Bought them for $245, now they are $345!!!","The Mirrors work great (altho hard to install), but the last two times I bought them on Amazon, I paid $245, now they are $345!!! What a Rip-off!!! Don't buy them until the price comes back down. They are just some plastic and a piece of glass. $350 for plastic and glass is outrageous."
5,"A Modern Herbal (Volume 1, A-H)",Although I preferred the older verison this is great for the beginner and advnce alike.
4,Quite interesting!,"Quite interesting books (two volumes) which combines information from divers old pharmaceutical books and ancient herbals.""A Modern Herbal"" is written in an easy to unterstand language. It contains a discription of each mentioned plant and information about cultivation, active components and classical medical usage.I'm not a herbalist! Nevertheless, plant extrakts may be interesting not only as a cure for a disease but also if you want to stay healthy. Furthermore, plants are more and more used by cosmetic industry.You should keep in mind that even ""harmless"" medical plants can course dangerous allergies if the hole plant is used. This risk can be avoided if a pharmaceutical or cosmetic preparation is used which contains only the active component (e.g. Bisabolol)."
5,Herbs,"this book and vol 2 are a must to anyone who is interested in herbs .It is the best book on the complete list of herbs ,description and what it is used for and how to use them"
3,Just OK,"This really wasn't a life changer like many reviewers wrote but it is a decent ""notebook"" to kind of keep up with your spending habits.I used it a lot the first day i got it because it was almost the end of the month so i had plenty of receipts, etc. to write and organize in. Now though i don't really feel like writing in it every time i get a receipt, i wait until they kind off pile up..:)I guess it has to do a lot with a person's lifestyle as well so i cannot really say if i recommend this or not it just didn't really work for me."
2,Home Budgeting,"Need more specifics like Auto Loan, Auto Expense, Auto GasEntertainment need also Internet expenses, Cable/Sat TV expensesInsurance need Home and AutoLoans Credit Cards more spaces for LoansTaxes need personal property and Motor VehicleJust to menyion a few that I end up having to make notes at these amounts to know what the money is for"
1,not what i expected,"I expected it to be more. I was looking more along the line of a ledger but it turned out to a book with a,couple of pages for your budget"
3,I really like this book- but it came used.,"As I was looking through the pages of this nice book to help budget our money... I saw great ways to track expenses... and 2 pages taken up of someone who has already tracked their expenses! I have contacted the seller- and I hope they can make this right. I was disappointed because I feel like it's wasted ""money saving space"", which to me is pretty ironic. But we'll see! Other than that- great book & I hope it really helps! I look forward to faithfully using it!"
2,The columns are too small.,I don't recommend this because the book and columns are too small to write in. I felt it was a waste of my money.
4,Useful,"This is pretty useful recorekeeping system. However, it was a bit time consuming for me. I prefer Quicken Home and Business where I can subcategorize and have pc calculate budget for me.I had Home Budget Book for couple of years and it made budgeting simple. Anybody who are interested in keeping financial situation under control should own this book"
4,Very Detailed...first page hand written as an example??,"I'm a month into it. Seems good so far, great for keeping track of category spending through the year, but think I will keep to my other budgeting systems.The IRS forms and suggestions has been helpful so far.I do with there were more lines for adding categories that I need, some don't really apply for me (or maybe need an update)."
1,more for bussines,Not at all what i was hopping for and the return window was very short. so now im stuck with an empty book and nothing to do with it .
5,Budget,This product was just what I was looking for and provided me more. It was priced and of VERY good quality. It was hard for me to find something that allowed to have an area to plan for savings as well as have a place to put receipts and calculate for the end of year totals. Will order from this seller again.
5,The Best Home Budget Book,My store stopped carrying the Dome book. I used the one they did have last year and never did like it. I'm so glad I found the Dome on your website. I'm using it this year and it's great for my needs.
3,Good as a guide,This is a good tool for a guide but does not assist me the way I had hoped. I will have to expand the ideas on the pages present.
4,The Way West,"This book was chosen as a selection for our Pulitzer Book Club, where we read a Pulitzer Fiction Book six times a year. Being a decendent of a family that came by covered wagon to California and having family living near Barlow Trail in Oregon, I really appreciated the author's depection of the daily struggle and successes of the families coming from Missouri to Oregon. The book group, as a whole, felt that the characters were not developed enough and the book was written more for youth. I disagree. These people were not on the whole educated people but they were people desiring a different and better life not only for themselves but for the United States. I am glad I read this book and I hope to give the whole trilogy to my family."
3,usual tribulations,I enjoyed the reading of this book but was left thinking I'd just read a short story. There are so many good western writings that one to be noticed really needs to devlop memorable characters like Mr. McMurtry or stories like Mr. Lamore to name but two.
3,comment,id like to compare this book to zane grey &louis lamour &possibly emily dickinson as style goes the characters were efficeient the plot strange &the theme essential subjectively &objectively speeking +_)(*&^%$#@!~a-z&0-9...
4,Excellent Double-Disc Set.,"I'm sure many people looking into this cd are most familiar with Kruder & Dorfmeister as one of the dominant releases on K7 Records, but as I found myself after discovering Kruder and Dormeister a few years ago, there exists a whole repertoire of tracks that interlace downtempo with drum-and-bass, hip-hop, jazz elements, and various melodic components of electronica in general. I think the key, however, to this release that makes it outstanding (at least in my mind) is that there is definitely musical talent behind the songs put forth and represented by Studio K7. There is something represented here in many of the songs that I think are tough to find elsewhere in electronica and elsewhere in general, and my instinct tells me that the artists here have a true passion for what they do. That is all I could ask for."
4,Of galactic fish and machine cowboys.,"The typically adventurous and humorous metal band Galactic Cowboys are more straight-ahead metal and far less adventure on this disc. And that's good because with the zaniness dialed down we are treated to some scorching rock with melodic multi-layered vocals. With the weirdness largely absent and the humor much more mild we can hear the ripping music more clearly. Highlights include: ""Fear Not""; ""Stress""; ""Red Sun""; ""Idle Minds""; ""9th of June""; and ""Arrow""."
3,Good... just good,"I do like this album... I do. But, it's not my favorite of theirs. Although their show was a ton of fun on this tour, the album as a whole didn't totally do it for me like ""Galactic Cowboys"" and ""Space In Your Face"". The superior playing and vocals were still there, and I often find myself humming some of the songs from ""Machine Fish"", but unlike the previous 2 albums, there are songs I don't mind hitting the skip button on.Top Tracks: Feel The Rage, The Struggle, Fear Not, Psychotic Companion"
3,well..................to be objective,"This certainly is not a bad album, but 5 stars is way too many. Actually it deserves 3,35 stars but it just wasn't an option! There are some really good songs on it, but, like almost al CD's, there are some weak songs on it."
3,This is why there are so few covers of Steely Dan,The previous 3 reviews are right on the mark. I've often wondered why so few artists cover Steely Dan songs. This CD explains it. Even with top shelf musicians it seems to be nearly impossible to improve on the original. Maybe it's because the Dan occupies such a razor sharp domain in the music spectrum that it defies alteration.Eddie
4,Engine by Lumley - Review,The book is an excellent source for engineers and students as a technical refresher on engine basics.
5,Dictionary of the American West,This book is invaluable to me as I work in a Museum that specializes in western exploration and life. There have been very few inquiries from visitors from all over the world that cannot be found in this book. Information from the early 1800's to the present time abound in this book in very digestible terms. Excellent reference book.
2,"Not sure about the tools, but the case is a joke","After reading the glowing reviews here, I purchased several of these as gifts. When they arrived, though, the handle was already broken off of one of them. Upon closer inspection, the black you see on the outside of the case is a thin plastic that's glued (poorly) to the actual case. It was bubbling and peeling off, so I decided to return the whole lot. It just didn't look like quality ""gift"" material from the outside. I can't speak to the tools themselves, though. If you ditch the case, the tools may be quite nice as other reviewers have suggested."
1,70% Fell Apart After 1st Use!,"I got this for my father for Fathers Day and when he opened, one of the handles of the skewers was already broken off. We used them for the 4th of July for the first time and alllll of the skewers handles just fell apart. All of the handles are built the same way, so they all fell apart as soon as they went anywhere near heat.Also, the corn holders all fell apart IN the corn. Someone could have stabbed their mouth on it! We will be returning this ASAP for all of our money back, and probably never buying anything again from Mr. BBQ."
3,Tools good; casing poor,"The first time my son picked up the case of BBQ tools, the handle fell off. It was not strong enough for the very heavy tool set. The tools, however, seem to be of good quality. Being a Christmas present, this was disappointing."
1,Not Happy,"Arrived fast but damaged. The pieces on the inside were not very secure. The corn holders were bent, especially the small ones. The case was damaged and I just was not pleased. This is probably the only thing I have ever bought from amazon that was messed up."
1,Case arrived heavily damaged,"The box was shipped with no padding, so the spiffy case was all bent out of shape. The whole idea of getting this set is having a nice, neat place to put your BBQ utensils. Now I have a beat-up piece of crap where I can store my nice utensils."
3,mark's set,"The lower rating is for the very slow service. The product is nice; it was a gift, but wasn't sure it wasn't going to arrive in time. As it was, it was late for Christmas. Not good!"
5,Great gift for the grill-master in your life,"I purchased the Mr. BBQ grilling tool set to give as a Father's Day gift. After reading other reviews for this item, I was a little worried about the quality of the case, but the tools are very sturdy, and the case does not look cheap. The long handles will keep your hands away from the flames and make it easy to flip your food.The gift recipient is very happy with the set and is anxious to fire up the grill!** A note on shipping: This item ships separately from any other items you place in the same order because it comes inside its own cardboard box. Amazon does not charge you anything extra for shipping it by itself. **"
2,Not useful to study for NCLEX- RN!,"Do not recommend to use this only as a study guide for NCLEX! Very vague on information, hardly any pictures in the book."
5,Great investment,This book really breaks down my text book into easy understanding! It wasn't doing well in Med Surg and after getting this book I got the one of the highest scores in the class:)
5,Great for class!,Love that this book is set up using the nursing process tells you what to watch for and even incorporates peds. Wish I would have gotten this book in the beginning because I feel it could have really helped me out! Definitely recommend for student nurses.
3,nclex review book,"Book was bought for my daughter to prepare her for her NCLEX exam.Arrived promptly, in good condition.Will see how much it helps her."
1,Too much ink,"I would not have bought this book if I knew the CD was missing,and the practice tests in the book were done in ink. The book had ink all over it, you do that only if you if you intend to keep it.Dont sell it like that, or at least say so.I love the book, I just hate the condition of the book"
4,Illustrated Study Guide for the NCLEX-RN Exam,"I found this book to be extremetly helpful in preparing for the NCLEX. It contains the ""most important"" information in an easy to read format. I wish I would have had it during nursing school. I have learned a lot by the way the information is presented. The CD has great tests and gives rationales for each answer. A MUST HAVE!!!!"
5,Great Camera,"I purchased this camera over the holidays after extensive research on 3 megapixel cameras. I was hesitant to buy it because of it's 'newness' and lack of reviews, but I purchased it from a place I could easily return it if I was not impressed. I must say, this camera totally blew away all of my expectations! I have had a number of digital cameras over the past few years, but this one is by far the best. I put it up against a friend's Olympus D-550, which got Great reviews in all the PC magazines, and the Sharp far surpassed it (so much so, my friend is contemplating selling his camera and getting this one). It takes great inside and outside pictures, with or without a flash, and where I have had problems in the past taking pictures of people, this one does an unbelievable job. I would HIGHLY recommend this camera to anyone. It even has a TON of features for the 'high end' serious photographer..."
4,Fouth book in the Adams' series,"""On Mother Brown's Doorstep"" is the fouth book in the Adams series. Much of the this book is about the up coming wedding of Sammy Adams and Suzie Brown. Also we meet more of Suzie's family including Will Brown who is back from India due to health reasons and while home he meet Annie Ford and her family. But things are not good in Walworth, with three missing girls.While I liked ""On Mother Brown's Doorstep"" the whole substory of the missing girls really was not needed. Also I think that the Polly Simms character could be used better. But, thisreview should not turn people off to reading a great series."
3,wrong cover,"I would have liked to receive the book as it appeared in the image. I knew I was expecting to get a used book, but I honestly though that the cover was going to be like the picture. One of the reasons I purchased that book (and paid a little extra)in particular was because I was drawn to the cover.As for the content of the book, I was pleased that it was minimally highlighted"
2,Topor Thy Name Is Torpor,"Five hundred and sixty-four pages. 253,800 words... of sheer tedium. Webster's II Unitversity Dictionary defines torpor as: Torpor (tor'por) n. Lat. 1.) ...A state of mental... insensibility.Topor's Codicil fits that definition beautifully. In fairness the tedium may be outweighed by the tenacity of Topor in finishing this exercise in excellent writing. However, he does so at the expense of the reader. Miss pages 554 through 557 and you have missed the entire ending. Plus the prelude TO the ending. It comes not so much as a shock as a relief. Codicil is a book designed as a sure cure for the terminal insomniac."
3,"Excellent potential, but cut the violence and vulgarity","Overall ""The Codicil"" was riveting (to me, even more so than ""The Testament"" and this coming from a devoted Grisham reader). However, I would not recommend it due to the excessive and very unnecessary vulgarity and gore. It seemed at times that the author was going for the shock factor by trying to see how disgusting and violent he could get with his descriptions. Maybe that is what sells books and movies to the general public these days, but for me it's absolutely ridiculous to go to such extremes. I would not read him again."
1,Does Topor's mother read his writing?,"This could be a good story but I am so disgusted by the crude and obscene language that I am having a difficult time forcing myself even to skip through it fast enough to learn the ending. Are there any other readers out there who feel this way or are we just expected to accept this trash talk as the norm? I got this book because it has been compared to John Grisham's ""Testament"". Reading Torpor certainly reaffirmed my admiration for Grisham. Grisham's characters can express the full range of emotions without foul language. Bye, now, it's back to Grisham with a little Jane Austen on the side for me!"
1,"Tedious, terrible long, for the content","Very boring. This took me 2 months to muddle through and I'll never know if the story line could have been interesting, because the author tended to not stick to his subject. You could have cut this book to less than 100 pages and improved the story quite a bit. The rest was all fluff and political commentary and boring. The author fails to come up with even one character worth liking. The characters he tries to get you to like were usually the most reprehensible. How this got published, I'll never know."
5,I love this game,This game is so dumb that it is fun if you love bevis and butt-head you have to get this then.
5,Heh heh heh..huh huh huh...,"This game is good in capturing the shows feel. It's sick, twisted, and still, fun. When your Gwar tickets get eaten, puked back up, and sent through a lawnmower you got to track down each piece. In doing so you explore the town that Beavis and Butthead lives in and interact with many familure faces if you watch the show. Fun, yet, hard game to beat. Love it none the less, worth the buy no matter if you're pro-Beavis and Butthead or not."
3,The Maltese Falcon,"I already have the DVD, so I compared the picture quality ofthe DVD and new Blu-ray.The flawless cinematography is duplicated faithfully in the DVDwith luminous B/W images and details in even the darkest scenes. Sadly,although the Blu-ray is somewhat sharper, there is almost no detailin dark areas of the scenes, which look just black.No re-adjustments on my HDTV were able to rescue the dark subjectmatter, so I will continue to enjoy the DVD."
5,"""May I please have my gun now?""","This film is not a comedy but I laugh hard most of the way through it. It's so American. There's so much b.s. to wade through and Sam Spade is better at cutting through it than I am. And I've seen this film more than once. I've seen it off and on since I was a kid, with many years spaced in between. My most recent viewing was the most satisfying yet. If I could make one movie, it would be this one."
4,A Classic Noir,"Maltese Falcon is one of those films that defined it's genre and become a true classic. Bogart's performance is of course, amazing. Bogart plays the role of Samuel Spade perfectly, a street smart detective that soon gets in over his head in an international game to retrieve the Maltese Falcon. The film itself is wonderfully shot, playing with light and shadow as only a noir can. Bogart's role is astounding, but Mary Astor's role of Brigid keeps the question of her loyalties confused up until the very end. The plot is thick and confusing, serving to keep you lost until the final moments of clarity when Bogey figures it all out. Certainly a classic of it's genre and comes with my highest regards."
4,Wonderful Interpretation,"... I'm not sure why. The Maltese Falcon should be enshrined in the pantheon of great movies for several reasons. First, it is almost an exact interpretation of the book - right down to the little detail of the way Spade is amused at his own hand shaking after confronting Gutman. Second - the performances. Bogart immortalized two of the 20th century's greatest detectives - Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade. Peter Lorre is unforgetable as Cairo and there is the inimitable Sydney Greenstreet as Gutman. True, I didn't picture Brigid O'Shaugnessy as Mary Astor, but that's a trifle here. This is a gem of cinema that allows us to travel to a time, place, and STYLE that doesn't exist anymore."
3,3 stars out 4,"The Bottom Line:An overrated early noir that suffers from O'Shaughnessy's uninspired performance and the lack of any compelling characters the audience cares about, The Maltese Falcon is only really alive when Sydney Greenstreet is onscreen; look to Treasure of the Sierra Madre or Double Indemnity for similar themes done better."
5,Film Noire at its Best,"A dark detective story, which implies mystery. The characters are over the top as in any good melodrama. It is a fine film, which should only be shown in black and white as it emphasizes the shadowiness of the characters and plot."
4,Maltese Falcon,"A visit to the past, It is enjoyable to view a movie without special efects or supernatural themes,A time when men were men and women were mysterious."
2,"Great film, underwhelming DVD","Another DVD for which the makers seemed more concerned with rushing out a DVD than taking the opportunity to clean up the audio and video and make it the definitive release this classic deserves. Picture quality is noticeably inconsistent; audio flutters and is recorded too low--there is white noise during the quieter moments at normal playing volume. A VHS-quality release, but at least it won't degrade with repeated viewings. The extras are worthwhile, except for the ill-conceived cast bios, which fool one into thinking there's supposed to be more, when in fact there's only one bio--Bogart's."
4,Classic refurbished well,"If you look closely, you can still see a slight flutter in the shades of grey in the background, but compare the main film to the trailers in the extra features menu and you can see what a great job of reworking the film was done. Sound is clear and understandable with little noise. I had a terrific urge to drive into San Francisco afterwards and walk around in a hat and overcoat"
5,Bogart at his best!,"Being a fan of the highly popular ""Casablanca,"" I checked out this film to see Bogart in action again. I wasn't dissapointed with the results. The film boasts a great cast, (you'll recognize two players from ""Casablanca"")and develops the characters and plot with great skill. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to purchase it in the near future."
3,"Restoration, please?","A classic, and essential for any DVD library. But be warned that this is not a restored version. It's a fine print, and the sound is fine as well. However, there are several shots and one whole scene (at the location where Archer's body is found) that seem to have come from a different and poorer-quality print. Not bad enough to spoil your enjoyment, but given the price, fans may want to wait for a complete restoration."
4,Great film but...,"The TCM featurette ""Becomming Attractions"" is a 50 minute piece that's supposed to be AFTER the movie but is actually BEFORE it. How unfortunate that I have to fast forward through an hour of nonsense before actually viewing the movie."
5,The Maltese Falcon,This is what technology is all about! A stunning transfer of this classic movie to DVD. The picture is sharp and the sound crisp. Melding this great classic to DVD leaves one breathless!
5,Great old movies,There are two versions of the Maltese Falcon: the one with Bogart and an earlier one that is a hoot. If you like old movies you will like this set.
4,A Minor But Noticable Continuity Glitch !,"Earlier in the flick, at the crime scene where Bogy's partner (Miles Archer) has been killed, detective Polhaus (Ward Bond) displays the weapon - obviously a REVOLVER, and a large bore one at that - no small woman's puse variety. Anyway, later in the movie, Sam Spade calls it a ""Welby AUTOMATIC !"" For film noir that's like calling a long-bow a cross-bow !"
3,ooops!,I accidently ordered this by mistake and didn't take the delivery. I have seen the movie before but didn't want to purchase it at this time even though it is a classic and very interesting.
3,Great Film; Lousy DVD Transfer,"""The Maltese Falcon"" seems a natural for DVD; it's a great film that can be watched over and over. However, this release is very disappointing. No effort has been made to restore the film (and the visual flaws are quite noticable) and no effort has been made to add any supplemental material. What you get is a third-rate transfer of the film, and that's it. A real let-down. (Note: Bogart fans may enjoy ""The Big Sleep"" on DVD; there's no commentary but the transfer is good and you get two versions of the film).(NOTE: This review was written about the old transfer. In fall 2006 Warners released a 3-disc version which boasts a far far superior transfer. The set also includes 2 earlier film versions of the novel, which are far far inferior.)"
5,Potential for greatness,"This movie is very, very good. This is the first time I ever saw Bogart act, and although he is very good, he is no James Stewart. The camera work isn't that great, but maybe I've been spoiled by Hitchcock films. Sounds like I am being picky, and perhaps I am, but this is a Steward and Hitchcock fan writing this. Overall, I still highly recommend this movie and consider it a classic. I loved the ending."
5,Better With BluRay,"This is actually one of my favorite films of all time. It's a film noir before film noir. Film noir got very popular after WWII in the late forties and flourished in the fifties, but Bogie's performance and the cinematagrophy puts it as a well deserved forerunner to film noir. Bogie is perfect and Mary Astor is the most cunning and lethal femme fatale in movie history. Then there are the extras. In the previous DVD packet you got the two previous versions of this film including SATAN MET A LADY, which is laughable, but worthwhile to view just because Bette Davis is in it. After watching this I really can't wait for other classics to achieve BluRay status."
5,One of the all-time greats!,I've seen this movie countless times but seeing it in BluRay was fantastic. In the past the shadows have made it sometimes hared to make out details. Not with this version.
5,Maltese Falcon: Excellent film Noir,"This three -disc special edition is top notched. From the radio broadcast by edward g. robinson to the original motion picture versions of the film these are great extras. The picture and audio quality of the dvds is excellent. However no one embodies the role of sam spade as Humphrey Bogart and with a cast of villians as colorful as the ever elusive black bird, this film is a must own for any fan of bogart and of great film noir."
3,Poor quality,"Never should be called a bluray Picture was very grainey audio was 2.0, Could have bought this on VCR Been just as good... Story was interesting, Quality was not bluray."
1,Sticking with my VHS copy for now,"I would love to own a restored version of the Maltese Falcon on DVD, if it existed. I'll just stick with my 10 year old VHS tape for now. The film needs to be restored. Take a look at the way the second scene with Spade and Mrs. Archer ends. The film always seems broken at this spot, even when it runs on the movie channel."
5,the quintessential detective movie,the best private dick movie of all time. i could watch it a thousand times and it never gets old. when men were still men. put it on dvd pronto.
2,CONFUSING CLASSIC,"Famous 1941 film has lost its punch. Granted, one is assured of good acting with Bogart, Astor, Grreenstreet, Lorre, and Bond in the lineup. Likewise, Director Huston was never known for gaffes or poor quality. The casting is good. So, where's my problem? In a film dealing with dishonesty, there's not a single character that one can trust.This leads to a highly confusing tale that requires several viewings to set the audience straight. That's a definite no-no to me. Having seen this tale at least 6 times over my lifetime, I still couldn't begin to explain it to a non viewer with any sense of acumen. I'd rather try explaining baseball to a foreign novice. No, I think that this picture will continue on a downward spiral, based only on 70 year old reviews. Ted Williams is dead. Derek Jeter plays on."
2,"Come on, Warner Bros!","How is it in this age of computer technology, Warner Bros. is still churning out these black-and-white DVD's? Colorization should be a given. As it is, I can't make out a thing in this non-colored transfer. Until the colorized version is released for everyone to enjoy, I'm not going to buy it."
5,A must read book for all book lovers.,Cousins is a well written book with realistic characters that all can relate too. Molanda the main character is a person that waited on the Love of her life even though she had to overcome many obstacles. I won't give the plot away. Get the book and read it for your self. Enjoy.
3,Great book but...,"The book was in great shape! I needed it for an online class and didn't know i needed a specific ""code"" that was supposed to come with the book to take the class online. The book was about $70 which saved me money, but then I had to buy a $40 ""code"" that didn't come with it. If I could've done it all over again, I wouldn't have bought it online. Careful if you are using the book for an ONLINE class. Otherwise, the book was a grrreat buy!"
1,boring,"I swear, this book is the worst book ever for Mass Communications because it's just a bunch of articles about what might be the case of mass media in the future. If i didn't need the book for a college course, I would never have bought it"
1,"RIP OFF Alert, Publisher & the Author are Thieves...","WARNING- New Edition came out in Feb.'09...This publisher, and author(more like assembler of other peoples work)adds a few paragraphs every 6 months, and reissues another edition just to extract another ~$100 for a textbook that is a 400 page paperback that is an assemblage of other peoples work. This makes the used value essentially ZERO.Students can't afford to be ripped off by predatory publishers, and authors like this.Shame, Shame Wadsworth Publishing, Cengage Publishing, and Shirley Biagi"
1,Word facts,Book is too big and many of the origins I believe are incorrect. Will be returning the book
2,Not a good reference tool,"This book is interesting if you just want to read through and learn some interesting facts about word origins. It's not been a good resource for me for looking up meanings.I've tried to use it as I would use a dictionary. When I hear a phrase, I often wonder what it means. Just this morning I wanted to look up ""anchor to the wind"". I was pretty sure I wouldn't find it. I didn't. I did learn that the ""ch"" in the middle of the word anchor is confusing, and that it was added in error. That's interesting to know, but not helpful for learning the meaning of a phrase I've heard used.I can't remember previous examples that I've looked up, but my impression is that most time that I try to look something up, I can't find it. I don't know of a better book to recommend as a reference, but I do know that I've been disappointed with this book for that purpose."
4,a subtle portrait of youth diminishing,"do you remember, as a child, watching trains pass by? i'm guessing that you counted every car, reading the words on some; looking in the windows of others. this, to me, could stand as the definition for innocence and it feels as if the adult counter part of this process lies somewhere inside milos hrma, the narrator of hrabal's novella. milos is a young railroad apprentice who insulates himself against the reality of world war ii. he cowers when faced with authority and he fears that he is impotent. those fears are eventually silenced as he confronts a trainload of nazis and realizes the consequences of war. he lays bleeding and gripping the hand of a dead german soldier, who is both his victim and his murderer. hrabal has written an understated and poetic tale of german-occupied czechoslovakia that lives in your mind long after the eighty-five pages are read."
5,A fabulous female pop group with bite.,"This is a FABULOUS BAND! They rock! All their music is original and fun, without being utterly ridiculous. ""Surburbia"" and ""I'm Sorry"" are especially good tracks. :-)"
5,Choose Me is a great choice!,"It is Ruiz' clear prose that sets apart the voices of the two memorable characters in her debut novel, Choose Me. Eva Clemente is a professional, saved Afro-Latina woman who is happy with her life `as is'. Celibate, she is uninterested in a relationship with a man. Enter Adam Black, a probation officer and cancer-survivor, carrying a load of bad female experiences; more than enough to make him distrustful and wary of women. However, despite their protestations, these two find themselves attracted to one another and amidst maneuvering through day-to-day life, grapple with the resulting feelings. Choose Me, is a moving, must-read, well-written story of two mature adults, who when dealt tumultuous life-blows, discover a deeper relationship with one another than initially conceived, by learning to choose God first."
4,Long overdue...,"Albums like this come only once in a while-following in the tradition of other great bands and artists(such as:Yngwie Malmsteen,Deep Purple,Yes,Jethro Tull,etc.)this combination takes the Metallica sound to the next level.In fact,this release comes as no surprise from a band unafraid to push boundaries if that's what it takes to maintain the integrity of their creative vision."
3,"Not good, Not bad",Metallica a big name and they were good live band one day but now they arent james sing like he dont want to sing the others play ok but still not like they used to play...anyway about the songs some of them sound cool some of them sound shit but almost all the song the intro is cool then the rest of it is shit the new songs are ok no leaf is fantastic with the orchstra Human has a good intro and thats all if you want a good Metallica live album forget this one if you want to here how James is soooo bad live these days go ahead and buy this album.
2,They'll Be Cool Enough To Be on PBS!,"Well fellow metalheads, this is the end. The band formerly known as Metallica is struggling so much right now to find a way to write decent songs. So they've bombarded us with this one and disc one of Garage. Both of which have nothing new on it, and nothing that truly sounds like Metallica as WE know it. Not as MTV, the popular tennie-bopper or middle-age establishment now knows Metallica, but as WE, METALHEADS know it So in desperation they pull this stunt with the San Francisco Symphony. It was bad enough to be there live and sit through it. Plus to add insult to more injury, the symphony is nothing more but a very big and live synthizer to put the ""alternative"" twist to Metallica's new binge of anything but metal. Geez, how much longer before my grandma thinks Metallica is cool?"
2,"Starts out great, and quickly goes down the drain","""The Call of Ktulu"" was great, but the rest of the album just plain sucks"
3,"An addendum, see ""A great idea gone terribly wrong""","The orchestra work has about the complexity and creativity of video game music. Which isn't necessarily bad, sometimes I enjoy video game music. The first song I ever liked was the title theme to Ninja Gaiden for the original Nintendo =) To get an idea of what the album sounds like, listen to the music from Playstation's ""Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"". In all, S&M isn't bad, and can be nice to listen to, which is why I changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars. Oh yeah, I think you should know: James's vocals on this kinda suck"
1,Why Why Why,"After reading the first few reviews, I noticed they all gave positive feedback. I then scrolled through the 175 other reviews and found only about 5 that didn't like it. I figured the problem is that the real Metallica(old) fans don't bother to buy Metallica's CD's any more, so it's not possible to give a bad review. Everyone knows Metallica sold out after ""Justice"" due to Bob Rock and this album is just another way to rake in cash without writing any new material. The orchestra sounds awful, and is often too soft to be even heard. By setting a keyboard to ""orchestra"" mode, and inserting notes into some of Metallicas songs, you could have duplicated this album. Nothing new, nothing special...just tryin to be trendy."
2,"S & M, really?? I don't think so.","I expected so much more, as everyone I talked to liked this CD. ... there are two songs that I like. Devil's Dance for one, as it opens it sounds a bit fierce, nice to lose yourself into - heavy on drums and thumping guitar. The backup of the orchestra is awesome, just turn it up. Vocals are hot and seductive - James,I feel you too and I'm not afraid! The next song I like is No Leaf Clover since I've never heard it before there wasn't a memory to compare it to therefore no way to corrupt it with the orchestra. ..."
2,Almost,"In many respects this is exactly what you want it to be. It starts with the symphony and the metal band slowly kicks in with rising intensity until metal band and symphony are one thick slab of epic sound. And then, well, um...James Hetfield starts to sing. Ooh, ouch. Not good. Not only is off tune, he can't decide whether to snarl or sing really bad opera. To make things worse, he relies on the the crowd to sing certain lyrics, which you can only sort of hear. I'm sure this was a good idea at the live show, but on the recording it just piles onto the sad state of the vocal tracks.Oh and then there's Lars Ulrich's drumming. I'm sure he tells all his friends ""those symphony weenies just could keep up with me"". Um, I doubt it Lars. It was Lars that was too inconsistent. Listen carefully, slight changes in Lars rhythm all over the place put the whole thing just a bit out of sync.Too bad, this was a great Spinal Tap inspired concept."
5,Excellent Concert Set,"The CD collection at my house numbers in the hundreds, and this is certainly one of the best out of the bunch. Metallica is famous for their hard-rock style, and the addition of the symphony only serves to enhance the music. I think it sounds great, and I prefer most of the song versions on this recording over the orignals. A must-have for any Metallica fan."
3,"Censorship at its finest , or worst?","Censorship totally ruined this album for me. I bought this thinking it was an uncensored version but to my surprise it was ruined with interuptions of songs. The bleeps and maskings in the songs broke the feel of what Metallica really is. The hard core, blasting, sometimes angry, roar of the public eye (that some people are afraid to express) is what Metallica is all about. If that means having to hear a few bad words, oh well, let me hear it...and hear it loud! If you don't like it don't buy it. (thats why there are explicite word warnings on almost every album you buy anymore) I would advise if you want to hear freedom of expression, buy the uncensored version. If you are a whining liberal, and want to hear crap, buy this one."
2,This was a Stupid idea,I really thought that it was a stupid idea to make metallica play with a symphony theres people saying that this is their best cd ever but have they heard any of their old stuff that was totally awesome like master of puppets that song is on s&m but the awesome guitar part is replaced by some violin or whatever and the new songs they made suck too I mean metallica is like the greatest metal band so why would they mix that in with a symphony i think that this was a stupid idea and i'm glad i didn't buy this cd
4,metallica s&m,I'm having to rebuild my audio collection after a theft occured. Outstanding CD. I believe Metallica tried something NO-ONE else has accomplished. The San Francisco Symphany played with them live in concert.
4,Not Bad - Can't here Metallica very well,"Not a bad CD - the only criticsm I have is about the production. The orchestra is mixed too loud compared to Metallica, therefore I can't here them very well. Well orchestrated and score-written though!"
1,I WANT SOME CLASSIC MONEY ...,"God !!!! They managed to destroy the whole concept of a rock album with orchestra !!! How Kamen ( a superb maestro and musician ) entered into this fray ? METALLICA supreme arrogance reached new heights, when they allowed some of their classic albuns to be destroyed by the orchestra. THe orchestra plays bad ? Of course not !! It's just that the arangments has nothing to do at all with the songs !! I never listened to the CD after the first three times, it will be forgotten in my collection. METALLICA, you're history. I've got all your albuns (except for ""RELOAD""). Never again, never again. I quit."
1,Oh dear what were they thinking?,"I'd heard Enter Sandman and Unforgiven 2 and really liked it so i borrowed S&M off a friend. However having really tried to listen to it and like it I simply can't stand it. It is tuneless, unmelodic and daft. They seem to have forgotten that first and foremost it is important to right a good song which is interesting and enjoyable to listen to, rather than trying (unsuccessfully) to create weird/scary sounds."
1,Metallica is officially dead,"Metallica used to be the fastest, loudest, heaviest metal band out there. Now they're playing with a huge orchestra. I'm reminded of an interview the great Cliff Burton gave in '86 shortly before his death when he made the comment to the effect of 'why should we do something big and fancy? we're just up there doing what we do'. Well, you cant get much more of a bigger scale than this. Another problem is James Hetfield's futile attempts to be a good vocalist. The band was infinitely better when he just screamed as loud as he could. It went much better with the music. I'm sure Cliff Burton is rolling over in his grave, and Metallica is no longer a great metal band in my mind."
1,And I thought It Couldent get any worse.,"Just when I thought Metallica couldent get any worse....They did. This record is an insult and a slap in theface to true metal fans.They Destroy many Metallica Classics on this CD sacred songs Like Master of Puppets,Battery,and for Whom the Bell Tolls are Butchered on this record.If I could give this CD ZERO stars...I would do so.When it comes to this Live double CD I have three words of advice....DONT BUY IT!!"
3,"First is Rage's ""Lingua Mortis"" and then Metallicas S&M","when u have listen to the album of RAGE ""Lingua Mortis"" u cannot give more than 3 stars to this album.many saying that metallica are the pioneers in this style of music( metal& orchestra) but i think that rage's album was the first and much more perfect in sound and in the whole mixing of metal and orchestra"
2,This was recorded at my school!,"It is true, someone may have noted this before, but the berkeley community thearter is on Berkeley High's campus. I know I was their, they took over half are school for nearly all of april '99. Was not to much of a hit with the students, though jerks to us and their is not to much of a metal community at BHS, most students are rap fans ( I am not)"
1,A waste of money!,"This Cd is too much money for 2 discs of Orchestra Songs.If Metllica really wanted their music more available to fans,they should have left Napster lone.The only people who buy this album are 40 year old people who think that Metallica is still the hottest thing out.All of Metallica's songs sound the same I can barley tell a difference.I you want a good CD (That all the songs don't sound the same)Buy Jay-Z,Sisqo, BigPun,or N.W.A."
1,Sellouts turn their backs on fans,"Suing 350,000 fans in conjunction with the Napster action helps Metallica not a bit. Slapping fans in the face is a good way to start a career at McDonalds. I'm using my Metallica CDs for coasters now."
1,Metallica S&M Just does not work.,"Metallica was one of the most greatest metal bands for the past 8 years, but after 2 dissapointing albums (load and reload), this is just trash, poor orchestral nonsense, the only two songs I Like are master of puppets and sad but true, but this cd is nothing more than a rehash of led zepplin's classic, This cd is about as bad as an boy band album."
4,Most powerful music I've ever heard!,"When I saw the show on VH1 over the weekend, I just had to have this CD! It is truely the most powerful music that I have ever heard! Metallica's trademark pulsating guitar and drums accompanied by the orchestra - it was just awesome!I am an older Metallica fan (I was one of the ""big hair girls"" of the 80's""). I have a few of their previous albums. Lately, my tastes have mellowed out somewhat however,I have a feeling that I will like this CD the best. Metallica is always suprising you with something new - I also loved the acoustic stuff on their last album.PS: This would be a great workout CD for lifting weights or exercising - it's very motivating!"
1,Oh boy! Instant Money!,"What do you do when you're a fat, rich, complacent metal band with nothing new to say and you want to land some instant royalties? You put out a gimmick album! That's right fans- for the low, low price of a double CD set, you can hear your favorite rently-gone-lounge-act Metallica rockin' out with Kamen's rock orchestra just like you've always dreamed! Sheer Joy! What's that? You wanted Metallica to put out something original? What do you think they are? Musicians? Hmmm, I'm pretty sure this is Cliff's least favorite album too."
4,Excellent slaying music,This is my favorite album to listen to while getting wasted and playing counter-strike on hot summer nights.
2,an orchestra ...on a metal album ?,"Excuse me , but aren't these the same cry babies who whined about losing their Grammy to a band that incoperates a flute in their act ? Nice job on For Whom The Bell Tolls, but man ..Metallica belongs in the Cry Baby Hall Of Fame not the rock and roll hall of fame"
1,WTF!?!?!,"OK...ok.....I love Metallica but this is total garbage. Glad these days with St. Anger at least they are back in their right minds (that's a joke). Lets forget this trash not thrash ever happened. Pathetic pusstallica. With Metallica written on this its like a dung log covered in chocolate.....it's still a dung log. I'm amazed at how many 90's metallica fanboy idiots defend this garbage. Most people that defend their 90's garbage don't even know the first 4 albums or like them which speaks for itself. I mean the singing even sucks...but is has since Black I guess. To bad Metallica went back to the ""load"" style with dm and now they are recording with Lou Reed........"
4,So cool...,"I don't actually have this album, nor have I even listened to any of it, but I was hanging out in Berkeley at the park across from Berkeley High when they were there playing a concert which included the symphony orchestra and which I believe is also where they recorded most of the music for this album. It sounded so cool, I wish I had gone with the kids that snuck in to the show via the school's roof..."
5,Tour de force!,"Wow!This album is incredible! I'm what one would call a ""general fan"" and own a couple of Metallica albums, but I love this.Michael Kamen did a masterful job of arranging the new music. In addition to beauty, the orchestra adds even more depth and power to Metallica's music.BTW... Zach Mullis had it wrong. ""Fuel"" is on disc 1, track 6."
4,"A ""must have"" album for any Metallica fan!","For every Metallica fan out there this is a ""must have"" album. Its a 2 hours compillation of some of Metallica's most popular songs through the years, plus you get to hear them with extra musical depth, provided by the SFO. However, do not expect more than that. Even though all the musicians are sharing the same stage, after listening to the whole album you get the impression that Metallica recorded a regular live presentation and then, in the studio, the orchestral arrangements were added. There is no ""chemistry"" beteween the orchestra and the band. I would've loved to find some re-arragments on some of the songs, to give more presence to the orchestra, i.e: I would loved to find some of Kirk's riffs played enterey by violins and in some other songs I would liked to hear to the SFO interpreting alone. I like the album. Its a fine job, however, it was a chance for them to make something bigger, much more impressive, and they missed it. Sad but true."
5,I couldn't have asked for better,"Great CD, got it used, but seller could have passed it off as new because it was in such good condition."
2,It couldve been alot better.,"There are only a few songs on here that sounded good with the symphony they are-""Bleeding Me""-""Hero of the Day""-""-Human""-""No Leaf Clover"" and -""Nothing Else Matters"".The rest of the songs the Symphony flat out Ruins.What songs are they playing.They dont go with the songs at all.If you Want to here Metallica Live get the ""Binge and Purge Box Set"".Although ill give them credit for trying it.It was a really Cool idea....but Michael Kamen was the wrong man for the job."
2,I guess it's NOT the thought that counts,"I always thought it would be great to have Metallica Songs played by an orchestra, so I was very excited when I heard of this attempt. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work. First of all, it's live, and that's never a good thing. Second, Hetfield's voice drowns out the music most of the time. Finally, the bass and drums are all but non-existant. They're there; they're just so insignificant that the whole sound is altered. I still think this can be done right, but it's highly unlikely they would do it again. I guess it's my loss. Perhaps, 1 star would have been more appropriate?"
4,"Pretty good, but...","I saw heard most of this on MTV, and I thought it was pretty cool. The *idea*, though not original, of having an orchestra perform with a band like Metallica is great, but only to back up the existing music. I got the impression that the orchestra was throwing *too* much into the songs, and it kind of sounded forced and overdone in a lot of places. If you want good rock with an orchestra, my suggestion would be to have a listen to Yngwie Johann Malmsteen's Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra in E Flat Minor Opus 1--now *that's* pure genius. Aside from all that, this album is good except for the parts where it sucks."
5,Symphony + Metallica = SWEET!!,"I don't get why everyone well, almost everyone hates this. Ever since I was born (1993) I loved Metallica. I mean this inspired me to be in symphony band. Thanks Metallica, it is a true masterpiece. I love you all!"
1,"LISTEN TO THERION'S ""VOVIN"", ""THELI"" OR ""DEGGIAL""","Please listen to therion, rage, or nightwish, or hammerfall or some others. Without the orchestra this qould have been an excellent album, but the orchestra is totally out of place, of course it has its good moments, but i think there some points in the songs when they should have been in complete silence.This is not original, many metal bands have done this before and better.Someone should teach James to sing ""NOTHING ELSE MATTERS"" his voice sound terrible on this song.After all i agree, metellica is not playin metal anymore, and these days are never coming back, now they are just an american elite band and not what they used to be....LONG LIVE TRUE METAL AND NOT THIS.....LONG LIVE NAPSTER, LONG LIVE NAPSTER, LONG LIVE NAPSTER.VOVIN IS A GREAT ALBUM FROM A BAND (THERION) WHOSE WORKS WITH OCHESTRATION ARE GREAT AND NO LIKE THIS METALLICA ALBUM. I'M SORRY CAUSE S&M WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT MR. KAMEN WAS NOT THE BEST CHOICE FOR THE JOB"
4,"mixed feelings, overall pretty good","i think combining the symphony with some of their songs was a good combo, but id prefer to see metallica live than hear them, it just doesnt sound quite right listening to them without the adrenaline of actually being at the concert. good selection of songs though, pick it up if u like metallicas other stuff. id suggest getting this album last to complete ur collection, get all the other stuff first (except st anger)"
5,Some songs can do without the classicle backing,"I've been a Metallica fan since they brought out their Re-Load album.Now this album ""S&M""is the third Metallica album I have.Some songs just don't go good with the classicle backing.Like Fuel or Bleeding Me.Then there are some songs that sound pretty darn good with the classicle backing.Like Nothing Else Matters or One,And the new songs on here are great.Human and the other one is No Leaf Clover.My only regreat about this CD is(Some of you might laugh at me for this)Low Mans Lyric is not on it.Thats my faverit Metallica song.I say buy this CD"
5,Metallica S&M: with all of the best songs?,"In my opinion, Metallica's new album entitled S&M is one of their best yet. The Symphony does an excellent job of including their style with the metal that Metallica fans are used to. Even non-Metallica fans will enjoy this album for it's rich music. I highly recommend this ablum to anybody who enjoy's excellent music."
3,Actual Musicians with Metallica?,"I can't totally diss this cd, because the orchestra was very good. great musicians. The only musicians that weren't good were these 4 guys I need not mention there name.They had alright stuff in the past but why bring mediocre musicians to talented, berekley trained musicians. If there is one good thing about this album it shows how much greater there music vocabulary is than Metallica's. I think they should of quit after the black album, so this is a dud.A couple of the songs were ok, but the clashing of two different styles did not go well. It literally sounds like a bunch of noise when you add two genres together. It might of work if metaliica was made up of talented musicians, not egomaniacs."
1,This record SUCKS,"I can't believe all the 5 start ratings for this hunk (...). Metallica hooked me back in the Lightning days, and I was a fan until the Black album. I can not believe the sell-outs they turned into. When you start making music just to sell records, it means you sold out. It's as simple as that. These guys are ridiculous. Has any one of you actually listened to the old Master of Puppets? That used to be the baddest song ever done, but this (...) orchestra is awful. It sounds like elevator music. Plus, James Hetfield has decided to TRY to sing now, whereas in the past, he just yelled on key. Much better back then.I feel sorry for all you poor shmucks. You just dont realize good music when you hear it. DO me a favor, pick up a copy of Soulfly - Back to the Primitive, or Slayer - Reign in Blood if you want to hear good music. Metallica is for losers."
2,SAD BUT TRUE: Metallica is DEAD! --- REST IN SELLING OUT,"What is this? What do they think they are? Is this really the same Metallica, who created the greatest metal masterpieces - Kill 'em all, Ride the lightning, and MASTER OF PUPPETS ? My last advice to them. - Please retire right now, before it's too late."
1,Metallica sucks now!,"Remember when Metallica was cool? I do. Back in the day,they had a f*** you attitude,heavy guitars,hardly any air play except on college radio,the metalheads liked them (not the preps). 1991 it kinda started to fall,they were becoming more popular,you saw preps at thier concerts,the band started smiling in thier videos. 1996 was the beginning of the end. ....But I didn't lose hope I thought maybe someday they would go back to thier roots a little and do something cool like KILL EM ALL,RIDE,MASTER,or JUSTICE....but no...they're totally content on being popular. Symphony? Oh jeez. I don't even want to listen to their old albums any more. Thank god there is still Slayer and Testament. Metallica are a bunch of dorks now! Even if they do go back to thier roots,it will be too late."
1,another sad excuse for a metallica album,the title of this review says it all. any true heavy metal fan will never ever buy this cd.
1,S&M DOES NOT WORK!!!,I read many good reviews for this cd so I boutght it and it is horrible. Enter sandman sounds really bad! overall it just doesnt work with the orcastra!! For any of you out there I wouldnt recomend this cd!!
2,Still don't like,"I listened to this some more, and it still makes me sick. There is way too much violins. sounds like some damn symphony rather than metallica. What's next? the metallica christmas album or them playing with garth brooks. He is more of a rocker than them anyways."
1,WHAT A JOKE ....,"You must all be joking saying how great this album is. THis is another step in Metallica's carerr that astonished people. The orchestra is going nowhere while Kirk Hammett is playing worse than ever. The result is so annoying, so noisy, I have the guts to listen to it entirely only twice !!! THe is another indulgent step in this band's career, a band that lost all soul a long time ago and became just a typical MTV product."
5,Oh Baby,"This CD blows my mind and it is the best CD I have ever purchased. Anybody that even begins to think that this CD stinks is really screwed up and needs some sense smacked into them. Rock on, Metallica!"
3,ever listen to two songs at once?,"...for some of the tracks, that's what it sounded like. Others, like ""Ktulu"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls,"" were amazing with the orchestral backing. I really admire both the band and Michael Kamen for trying this, but I really expected more. For the most part, this certainly did not live up to the hype."
1,ALL CREDIBILITY HAS BEEN LOST!,"I'll keep it short & to the point - this CD is TERRIBLE! I can understand ""Load"" - I can even understand ""Reload"" - ""Garage Inc."" gave you back a LITTLE respect - but NOW....... it's starting to UNRAVEL guys! You aren't THAT good. Go back to your OLD style of metal........ otherwise...... we'll have ""Metallica with The Backstreet Boys LIVE in Disney Land"" next! NUFF SAID!"
1,Live with no meaning,"I really do like Metallica , also I like live albums and greatest hits albums. But ever since Metallica caused such a stir in the music Industry they have not been putting out very good music . So I guess it is there cheap way to try to make a comeback . I have all of there C-D's so I am not or was not downloading any of they're stuff nor would I old stuff is the thing I think should be alloud. But Metallica is a great band but S&M sounds like a cheap try for a comeback to greatness that they once had."
2,"not qualified to rate it, but I'll give my 2 cents","If you are remotely interested in this (or even if you don't like Metallica at all) you should check out CDs from Apocalyptica - ""Plays Metallica"", and ""Inquisition Symphony."" It is essentially Metallica on prozak - very cool stuff in my opinion."
4,Good CD,"Metallica is a great band,and this CD would Rule if not for the classicle background music.AS I read in another review Kamen sounds as if he was trying to put as much into the background as he could,and in some places he covers up Metallica all togeather.ButbI like Metallica so I rate it 4 stars.and also the music is great.Ecept the back classicle music."
1,"When you want Metallica real bad, there's real bad Metallica","Sucks! No, sucks is too nice of a word. Let's see, how can they make money without composing anything new, putting out another crappy live album, or let alone a greatest hits album? I got it! Let's play the same crap, but add an orchestra to it. The lame brains will buy the same songs again, put some $$$ in their pockets and not even Napster could even come up with a scam like this. They suck as artists, composers and players. They have nothing new to offer and are re-hashing the old stuff. Next album will be with the Boston Pops maybe? How about a rag-time band, a calliope, or 2,000 kazoos? Hell, they'd probably sound better."
5,Awesome!!,"OH MY GOD!! This CD was amazing! I guess I'm what they call a new Metallica fan. This was actually the first cd of theirs that I ever bought (I've since then bought more) and I'm glad I did. This CD has great songs of theirs from the past as well as two new ones, one (""No Leaf Clover"") being one my favorites. Metallica's instruments blend in perfectly with the symphony and the music just sounds awesome. James Hetfield sings perfectly, with his very distinct ""growl."" All the songs on this cd rock, but my favorites are ""No Leaf Clover,"" ""Nothing Else Matters,"" ""Fuel"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and the first song on the CD which is just an instrumentation but it's great, as well as the ""Call of Ktulu."" This CD is amazing and you would be a fool to not add this to your cd collection."
5,Breathtaking,"From the first time I heard this album just after it was released, to the time I saw the whole concert on DVD, to right f'n now, I've never been able to put my feelings to words. While combining rock and roll music with a symphony orchestra isn't exactly a break through in music, Metallica doing it is. The band has long been known as possibly the best Hard Rock/Metal band ever (not to take anything away from Led Zepplin or Black Sabbath) and this adds a totally new dimension to their music. From old classics like For Whom The Bell Tolls and One, to new hits like Hero of the Day and Outlaw Torn, this CD moves, mesmorizes and gives goosebumps to me every time.Even though I would have liked to see Sanitarium or Fade to Black in place of songs like Devil's Dance, this CD is well worth the 20 bucks for both CDs. And if you have a DVD player, get the live concert. Just as worth it"
4,"Good for fans of ""new"" Metallica","This one is for fans of Metallica's Load/Reload-era stuff. If you're looking for thrash, you'll have to look somewhere else. The songs that sound best with the symphony are the ballad-ish ones: Ktulu, Outlaw Torn, Bleeding Me, etc. Possibly the coolest version of NEM yet. The orchestra adds some heaviness to Thing That Should Not Be and Sad but True, and provides good intro work in several places (Battery, -Human). Some of the faster songs (Fuel, parts of Master of Puppets, etc.) seem kinda forced though, like it's just Metallica playing with an orchestral sound track behind them, and nothing's really being added to the experience. Not their best (hardest), but definately worth having if you like ""new"" Metallica."
3,Make that 3.5,"The obvious has to be stated with this album: it doesnt measure up to the actual concert experience. It will be difficult for casual fans and die-hards alike to appreciate Metallica + Orchestra by listening to a CD recording. That's the unavoidable fact that holds this album back. Otherwise, this is essentially a greatest hits album with 1.5 very good songs thrown in that, absent the concert hall, will make it difficult to appreciate either Metallica or the orchestra."
4,Metallica's hits live with a Symphony,"Metallica's S&M is a live concert with an orchestra. While the idea may scare fans off, the orchestra accompanying Metallica's songs is quite good. The playing from both groups is good, and what makes it even better is that being a live album, it removes the filler that often makes their albums dull and boring."
5,Evolution !,"Evolutive, that's how I must describe Metallica's work since the Black Album. It was back then when this awesome group faced a difficult choice, go down as the best of the 80's or live on as the absolute best of the 90's. Sell-out, alternative, revolutionary, call them what you want I just call this band and this record as PERFECT. I don't think anybody else in the universe could have pulled this off as masterfully as Metallica did (of course, they had the best base material to start with). To hear these songs coupled with the magnificence and power of a Symphonic Orchestra was like meeting with old friends that you haven't seen in quite a while, just to discover that they are the same guys that you loved to hang out wiht, but at the same time you discover how they have changed for the better. This will go on the books as one of the best records of the decade, I absolutely reccomend it to any open minded Metallica fan !"
5,I can't get enough!,"Since Metallica came to South Africa and I saw them Live, I'm making every effort to listen to their S&M (and watching Cunning Stunts) to get some more Metallica live. I just can't get enough. I want to cry when I hear this masterpiece. They are just so amazing and I'll pay a fortune and make myself broke just to fly across the world and see them again."
2,A desperate measure,"Metallica hasn't released a good album at all since the black album (which was only ok, it wasn't that great and was definately overrated). Metallica attempted to pull a zeppelin and perform with an orchestra. Neat idea, but this performance was lackluster and uninspired. James lost his voice, Kirk's guitar playing is still sloppy, and it's just pathetic how Metallica attempts to soldier on without their old sound. I wouldn't recommend this album at all."
1,A Weak Effort From Metallica,"I first listened to this album with some expectation of it being good. I was let down. Metallica's songs don't mesh very well with the orchestration, probably because the songs weren't composed with an orchestra in mind. Maybe if Metallica wrote some songs and arranged them musically with James, Lars, Kirk, Jason, and Michael Kamen (who conducted the orchestra here), we would get some songs that actually fit with orchestration. With the exception of ""No Leaf Clover,"" the orchestrations sound arbitrary.The idea of a rock band playing with an orchestra isn't terribly original, and I admire Metallica's effort to create something different from today's mainstreme music, but this ""S & M"" just doesn't succeed musically."
2,Just OK CD,"I like (OLD) Metallica. But this cd is kind of disappointing. Are they still a serious musician, or just entertainer? What I want from them is not great showmanship. I don't think they really needed orchestra for their new musical experiment. Rather, why don't they hire good synthesizer player?(seriously) Oh,Metallica. If you really want to continue innovation in your music, you must not lose your root. Playing with orchestra was not a very good choice. Once is enough."
2,"Boring, plain and simple","This has got to be their worst effort to date. This CD is nothing like their Binge and Purge album, even their new songs lack the Metallica feel they seem to be losing more and more every album. Very disappointing!"
2,What the hell!,"I think the idea of metallica recording with an orchestra is very cool. But when they don't include FADE TO BLACK, which in my opinion would work better with an orchestra then any of there other songs, it causes me to say what the hell. And on another note, James actually trys to sing. Personally I like the old screaming metallica vocals on songs like Master Of Puppets. I think metallica should leave the Orchestras for more melodic metal bands like Iron Maiden, Hammerfall, Edguy, and Rhapsody; they can actually do it right."
2,Hey guys.....they have talent but....,"Stop and think before you read this......about the stuff your listening to, and about it. I mean they may rock and roll your head off, but look at the message they're sending off. I mean give one listen to devil's dance and that makes you feel all weird inside. And they may make a lot of 'good noise' but still think before you do things and listen to music like this."
2,"Nothing Special, standard chart topping material","Apart from a few songs the symphony really doesn't add anything special sounding to the compositions, rather the two worlds of music collide head on creating one ugly jumbled pile of noise. It doesn't really matter anyway tho because no matter what they release people will buy (why i don't know), already number 1 in the charts (with other supertalented artists such as shania twain and celine dion, yeh!).For real technical and brilliant metal fused with classical music that actually allows for both forms of music to fuse together and create terrific and beautiful music, listen to Rhapsody and Therion instead, or aren't they mainstream enough?"
2,It is a huge disappointment,"I'm sorry, but the s & m sucks. It is ""old MetallicA"" songs in a sort of ""new MetallicA"" sound. It's kind of depressing that metallica has aged to the point that their music can be called just ""hard rock"""
1,Argh!,"Oh, for heaven's sake, do yourself a favor and listen to Rage's ""Lingua Mortis"" or ""XIII"" if you want to hear a METAL band USE an orchestra, instead of pointlessly grafting them on for a holiday publicity stunt. This turns my gut, and not in a good way. It'll sell millions. Hooray. I can't stand it."
2,...... sucks beond reason.,"You know, there is a very good reason parrellel 5ths (which are used %90 of the time in most metallica songs) are avoided when composing classical music. It starts sounding baaaad. Low crunchy guitars do not compliment violins, cellos, flutes, ect. The orchistra instruments must screach and wail to compete with Metallica's crash-bang-grunt playing style. I promise you, you will be SICK TO YOUR STOMACH about 3-4 songs in. Maybe if they went acoustic (like that will ever happen), it could have worked. DO NOT BUY THIS."
5,Goose Bumps!,I was really unsure of this album. The thought of Metallica playing with an orchestra didn't really appeal to me. I thought it would be awful. Since I am a die hard fan and a collector I decided I would rent the dvd before I purchased the cd just to see if I liked it. I was blown away!This is one of the best things I have listened to in ages!The orchestra does not take away from the music. Instead it adds power.I guess I shouldn't have doubted that anything Metallica touches turns to gold. This is a crowning achievement.
5,"Well, for one, 861 other people couldn't be wrong...","I just put this in after not listening to it for probably a couple years. Once again it blows my mind - you can read others opinion about the songs, or how talented Kamen is, but the bottom line is you just have to experience it for yourself. At first you may think, how the hell would metallica play with a symphony? Then you hear it; and suddenly genres typically poles apart blend together in an overwhelming aurgasm you have to hear for yourself. The symphony adds a whole new level to how ""big"" metallica sounds. The intros which are noticably metallica, but purely symphonic, such as ""no leaf clover"", build to a perfect peak and then rip open with your typically metallica suddenly accentuated by strings and brass. Absolutely brilliant."
5,beautiful but yet hard ;-),Metallica plays flawlessly throughout the album. Jaymzes singing is better than ever and the orchestra enhances the songs to new heights... An album that can also be enjoyed by people who normally don't listen Metallica
5,the low-down.,S & M is undoubtedly the most complete album released by metallica to date. The syphony orchestra (nice work guys!) adds a whole new depth and completeness to the already incredible sensory experience that metallica live offers. Allowing the musicians of metallica to explore new reaches with their songs. A true music making masterpiece!
1,appalling,"This Album is a sure waste of money! I am a big fan of metallica and have all their albums, but this one is a BIG disappointment. Why? Well let me tell you. The orchestra which supposed to be making stuff nicer etc. are F^&%# it up. The overall impression is chaos. Lots of times you hear shrieking violins and tooting trumpets when you least expect it and want to hear it. Even the unbreakable ""One"" was ruined. You get the impression that the orchestra is constantly reminding everybody that they are there (and unfortunatly they are) So if I were you I'd buy definately something else.. And yes Metallica DID sell out."
1,Metallica baaaaaaaaadddddddddd Iced earth good,"THIS CD SUCKS. NEW METALLICA SUCKS, CREED SUCKS, AND IF YOU BUY THIS CD YOU SUCK. IF YOU WISH TO BUY A METAL CD BUY AN ICED EARTH CD, TRUE POWER METAL NOT THIS CRAPPY PANSY NEW METALLICA CRAP. I AGAIN EMPHASIZE THAT S$M SUCKS, LOAD SUCKS, RELOAD SUCKS, AND GARAGE INC SUCKS.IF I COULDE GIVE THIS CD '0' STARS I WOULD, THIS IS THE PANSYIST PEACE OF CRAP YOU COULD BUY. FROM NOW ON I SAY THE BAND RENAMES THEMSELF WIMPICA SO THE WORD METEL IS NO LONGER IN THEIR NAME AS ITS NO LONGEER IN THEIR MUSIC!"
3,Too much symphony,Really liked tunes but some damn sympnony is playing. Kind of makes it like a mix of metallica nd symphony. Would have been better if they played alone
5,GODS OF ALL ROCK!,"This album proves that Metallica are the best band ever. Not even Guns and Roses compare, the raw combination of hard rock and passionate melodies provided by one of the most powerful orchestra's in the US, help to give a real feeling to the album, it shows how to break down walls between music,together it puts disgrace to Limp Bizkit who are absolute rubbish. Rock needs passion and fire to it, this give it full blooded and pumping with the best guitar work in the land,they are legends to all self respecting rock bands.You'll sweat after hearing the first two songs on this, it moves you so much, buy it now, before it's too late."
5,Amazing,"When i got home with the CD i immediately turned it to master of puppets, it being my favorite Metallica song, it was amazing, the orchestra made the solo fuller and added new life to the song. The only thing i saw wrong with S&M is that they didn't play anything off of Kill em' All and Garage Inc., and they could have played some better songs. Fade to Black, Creeping Death, Anesthesia, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Die, Die My Darling, and a few more would have been great with the orchestra. But all and all its a must have album."
4,DAAAAAAMMMMN,"This album was very well done, sort of, There were a lot of songs that really lent themselves to be orchrestrated, but there a few parts that should have been left alone, mainly the last part of One. Otherwise, don't borrow this from a friend. Buy it yourself or steal his or her copy."
5,Awesome,This is and awesome CD. Just the mix of the orchestra instruments and the elecric basses and guitars gives the songs some awesome character! I highly recommend this CD
5,metallica or nothing!,"The lyrics are great, the vocals bust! the percussion a must and the strings are heavy, Love it!"
3,Brave venture falls flat.,"Before I get torrents of abuse, I have been a Metallica fan for about eight years now, since I was twelve. Now we've got that out of the way; this album represents a radical departure, especially for a true metal band and Metallica must be commended for their effort but to tell the truth this album left me feeling a little cold. It doesn't seem to come together in the right places. Some songs, like 'Nothing' or 'Ktulu' were written to be played with an orchestra, but 'Outlaw Torn'? C'mon it's a blues song plane and simple and where are 'Unforgiven' or 'Fade to Black'? At times the orchestra seems to get drowned out, like on 'Sad But True' and then on other occasions, like 'Master' the orchestra makes the music sound like a schlock horror soundtrack. Overall it's a good idea but I guess you had to be there to appreciate the spectacle."
2,"ok, but not the best out of symphony/rock crossovers","First off, let me tell you that I am a metal head in the purist sense of the word. Metallica have not released a metal album since their self-titled, which isn't bad, I'd just like to state that. This album is ok, the reason I say it's only ok is because most song on this album loose their original feel with the way James sings and with the orchestra added. It gives the old songs a different feel. My favorite on the track is 'Battery'. Now, if you want to check out some Real symphonic metal, go listen to Therion's previous release, Vovin. Symphonic metal with full opera vocals. Those boys know how to do it right, and have been doing it years before Metallica even thought about it. There are also quite a few black metal bands that do the symphonic metal thing, but chances are, if you're a fan of 'new' Metallica, you're not going to like black metal (the most extreme music on the planet)."
3,"OK, not good nor great","All in all, this is a pretty bland album. For one thing, there are too many newer (i.e., blander, not as good) songs on this album, rather than the old Metallica stuff. For another, the mix of Metallica and the orchestra prevents the band itself from being loud and ""metal"" enough to properly offset the orchestral sounds.The singing by Hetfield is just OK, too. His voice doesn't sound as good on these songs -- not enough angst, roughness in his sound.Again, it's just a bland album. I listened to it a few times, but never got into it. I ended up giving it to the local library so others can listen to it if they want.It could have been a great concept, and it probably sounded great in person, but on CD it's not anything to get excited about."
2,S & M: Symphony and Metal or Stupid and Mindless?,"I am a die hard Metallica fan, but now I think it is time to die. The idea of symphony and metal is pretty good, but it is not adequately represented in either of these two CDs. Hearing my favorite songs mangled by Hetfield's quickly turning geriatric voice far from impresses me, and it seems that the classical side of the music is just an accompaniment. If the classical part of the music were just taken out, then there would be little difference. The long and short of it: unless you want to hear Hetfield moan like an 80 year old into the mic, don't buy this one."
5,S&M kicks ...ya know,Metallica's S&M is a great compilation of some of Metallica's great songs. It is a semi-live format and it rocks.
1,absolute crap,"the sound quality in this is attrocious. It has neither the charm of a live concert recording of Metallica, or the clarity of a symphony recording. The strings are mostly muddled by the feedback from the guitars. the old favorites are played with less enthusiasm or skill than on prior live recordings, and the new tracks were not worth the time or effort to listen to. No Leaf Clover??? WTF??? No point including it.stay away, by the Binge and Purge, and you'll be happier."
1,what a joke.,way to mess up some really good songs like battery and the thing that should not be. this album is a thing that should not be.
1,rockarolla,hi my name is sung pyo.lee i'm living in seoul korea. i love rock'n roll music N' collecting the CD record. please send the rock information.
5,one of their best,i'm a huge fan of metallicas. i have all their albums. this is by far one of their best. after i bought this i went out and bought all of their other cds. i rate this five stars and more. jame's voice is amazing. the symphony is a great addition. i cant wait for their next release. this is a must have if you have ever even heard of METALLICA. METALLICA IS THE BEST BAND EVER.
5,Versatility at its best!,"I love Metallica no matter what they do! If they had kept on with the earlier ""head banging"" music, (not that I don't love it too!), where would they be now? Same place Megadeath is.....(nowhere!)"
5,THE GREATEST GREATEST HITS EVER,"What a good album! I was personally at the show, and I can say that these CDs truly capture the essence of the event. The new material, ""No Leaf Clover"" and ""-Human"" are a strong testament to Metallica's staying power. With almost all songs clocking in at around 5 minutes or less, the price is reasonable. Never count them out...they're the best, because NOTHING ELSE MATTERS...and I reccommend this album to everyone, fan or foe..."
4,A theory materialized,"Some rock n rollers (and I am included) bear an interesting theory: classic music is indeed heavy metal music. If you take the violins from a Beethoven music and replace them for guitars, you will find heavy metal music. Michael Kamam proved that! And he also agreed with that theory himself. Listen to this great CD and you will understand it. The CD could have been even greater if Metallica and The San Francisco Simphony had chosen the ideal musics. I think that songs like Until It Sleeps, Memory Remains or Of Wolf And MAn, just dont fit well in a classic tune. They should have chosen the Metallicas ideal tunes. Imagine To Live is To Die, And Justice For All, Harvester of Sorrow, Unforgiven or My Friend Of Misery played with the Simphony. Well, theres a lot of space for a second show. But the Cd is great. At last something really good from Metallica. I thought the band had died after the album ""Metallica""."
5,"An excellent, original idea by Metallica","This cd is fantastic! I love the marriage of hard rock and orchestral arrangements! Other bands that try something ""different"" with their music usually end up in a completely different direction from their musical roots, i.e.,100% accoustic or orchestral, but Metallica does not lose any of their hard-edge sound. ""No Leaf Clover"" and ""One"" are done beautifully, and Hetfield's voice is prowling, growling and sexy, as usual. This cd is right on the money and is worth every penney!"
3,Best live Metallica album,"Sure, you've already heard all of these songs, so there isn't too much new (there are 2 new songs, but they're nothing to write home about.) Overall this is a decent CD (hence the 3 stars), but if you already own the albums that contain these songs, you might be disappointed because these versions don't improve too much on the originals. The exception to this is One. This song absolutely blows me away every time I hear it. The symphony complements the band perfectly. My advice is don't buy this CD, just go on iTunes and get One."
5,felt like i was there!!!!!!,I bought the cd and the movie i love the realistic concert....my god these guys are talented!!!!!!!
2,the end,to me this is metallica throwing in the towel after 20 years of solid heavy metal. (glad they did it before another reload)
5,S & M- Metallica and San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,"This was an awesome. Probably the best one yet. Not only did they do excellent songs but the orchestra helped add to the awesome effect of the songs. It added a certain mood that a guitar cant add. I loved the CD, especially the 2 new songs. I really think any true Metallica fan would love the CD and its a great CD to add to a collection. Even though it's an orchestra they still come through with the hard hitting power chords and fast guitar riffs as the Old Metallica from the Master of Puppet days."
2,Not my bag,"Metallica has some pretty cool songs, but most of them aren't on S&M. I prefer listening to Unforgiven II and the song from Mission Impossible, those are my favorite Metallica songs. If I had to recommend one Metallica album it would be Ride The Lightning."
2,it doesnt fit!!!,"the orchestration somehow doesnt fit together with the metal playing. you think that u are hearing two different musics playing one song and who r trying to sychronize themeselfs but they cant.if u want to hear metal with orchestra there is ONLY ONE album and no otherRAGE- LINGUA MORTISthere the music is unique , the orchestration perfect, it sounds like the orchestra was for many years playing with the band. if u once hear the RAGE's album u throw METALLICA's one away"
2,Metal???,"This is more like classical,its just so annoying,violins??on a heavy metal album,i mean come on.The only good thing i can see about this album is master of puppets,with the guitars amplified a thousand fold,its awesome.but other then that its just awlful. I know there's a lot of people out there who love this album(my friend for instance,but he's just weird)and maybe someday if i listen to it enough i will aswell.but i doubt it.If you dont have any metallica albums,i suggest you buy,self titled,or master of puppets.but stay well clear of this."
2,METAL with CLASSICAL? WHAT THE HELL?,"I have been a Metallica Fan from the beginning. I stuck with them through thier genre changes. From 'Fast Thrash', to 'Slow Metal', to 'Hard Metal', Metallica have remained the MASTERS! So when a band as high up as Metallica are, why mix your hard, head banging, riffs, with poncy slow violins and chellos. The legendary loud sounds of 'Enter Sandman' and others are drowned by the slow harmony of the orchastra. It doesn't sound good. It's softened the hard element which we all no and love of Metallica. Advice boys.....Don't ever do it again!"
5,'Tallica & Symphony,"The greates experience in listening. This album is grat, great sound, great conjuction between the band and the orchestra. The songs are greately performed by both sides, the band in their gratest times, doing the greats thing. This is a must buy album, evey MetallicA fan shoul by it NOW, the greates idea of all, putting the bad where they chose to be. Very extreme music played at their greates, realy strong songs like Master, or Thing to calm melodies as Matters and Hero, very well backed up by the symphony. THis albums shows that nothing stoppes METALLICA."
2,Unholy alliance gone horribly wrong,"While isolated pockets of resistance whine about the downfall of Metallica, I feel a need to chastise the SF Symphony for letting these amped-up headbangers share their stage. Whoever conceived the idea of rudely jamming two diametrically opposite musical groups together must be laughing pretty hard by now. Shame, SHAME on the SF Symphony for thinking they could get away with this. Stick to your classical roots, please. Even converting Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin, viola & orchestra into a duel between electric guitars would have been better than this."
1,Worst Album Ever,"I gave it one star cause zero is not an option. They are a METAL band its an incredible disappointment to hear thier songs played by an orchestra, if your a true fan that is!"
2,s&m metallica,I received the cd and the case holder was broken and the cd was scratched. i have not had a chance to get information on returning the cds. i am unable to listen to the cd well because the scratch is on several songs. i was not satisfied at all
2,Now it's obviously Metallica's vocalist would rather hush,"Orchestra sounds great! You see, even primitive and poor Metallica songs sound not bad with orchestra! The only problem is their ""cool metal rebel"" vocalist-millioner has no idea how he should sing..."
1,Selloutica,"This band just makes me want to puke my guts out.They are such back stabbing, hypocritical sellouts,it makes me sick.This latest ""album"" is another flacid attempt to makemoney. Clearly, this band has no creative integrityleft. Furthermore, they have not had an original ideain years. They are creatively stagnant.Cliff Burton must be spinning in his grave. He must bejust as sickened as I am. Metallisellout are theyworst musical ""traitors"" in history. I hate them now.This band died with Cliff."
2,Met + San Francisco Orchestra = Pretty interesting show,"This is definitely a different approach by Metallica and any metal band for that matter. I absolutely love Metallica and yes I do own this title however if you really knew Metallica and loved their heavy stuff, this won't do it for you. While I only give it 2 stars, I really think that its a descent live show. I wish they would have had more than just 2 new tunes to offer up here. Pretty cool hearing some of the older Met tunes with the symphony behind them. Its not a terrible album and it may grow on me, but it does seem kind of gimmicky."
1,Just plain stupid,"I suppose if you ""love everything Metallica does"" you'd buy it if they had a bunch of zoo animals on stage braying while they ruin their classics. A symphony is simply too complicated and delicate for metal, period. The album starts off in an interesting way, but as soon as the distortion kicks in all you hear of the symphony is an occasional wail of violins in the quieter patches. I've wanted a good Metallica live set for years, but this is a joke. I agree with the other reviewer, at this rate we'll have Kenny G replacing the lead guitar on Master of Puppets. By all means, spend your money replacing those worn out tapes and scratched up cd's of the classic Metallica stuff."
3,Bring me the noise back!!!,"on ""S and M"" metallica became polished,balanced and rawless...i loved Metallica for their brutal and agressive trash metal songs and even for solid heavy-rock from their latest albums.here in orchestral arangments all tracks are loosing power and emotions and are becaming blank.i am telling about ""Fuel"",""Until it sleeps"",""the thing that should not be"" and some others.luckilly ""One"",""Human"" and ""Outlaw torn"" became much more stronger and monumental after filling it with Michael Camen's orchestra.the sound gets much more dream-like and you can just flow with music...anyway - get Metallica's regular albums.""S and M"" is kind of experiment,surely it's interesting but not really great.This group works better without orchestral power!"
5,The best you'll ever hear Metallica,"More than likely if you're here, you've heard something off of this album already. Metallica with a symphony is such an incredible sound. There are no empty gaps in any song. What makes Metallica one of the best bands of all time is that they're not afraid to try something like this. All those other metal bands out there have too much foolish pride to even consider leaving the rut that they're stuck in. Definitely buy this album for a most unique experience."
5,S & M Rocks !,"This is in my opinion one of the bests live albums i've ever heard from Metallica. They defenatly know how to make a great show, their playing is so good, the way they get the crowd to participate is so cool and the symbiosis that the heavy playing along with the symphonic playing makes the music not only really interesting to listen but yet really powerfull intense and deep.Congratulations for the idea guys !JC"
4,coded for region 2,"when I saw it on the mobile site, it didn't say anything about region 2 and we didn't notice it until after we had opened the movie. Oh well, it was cheap enough that I will buy the correct one."
5,Excellent movie!,"This is one of the greatest musicals of all time, and is definitely one of my favorites. Great movie for people new to musicals."
5,seven brides for seven brothers,"couldnt be better characters well presented, brilliant plot and wonderful, wonderful songs. The actors portray the characters perfectly and the film has certain funny parts that could be called side splitting"
5,If you think dancing is for wimps...see this movie,"Not only is this restored musical as good as I remembered, the special feature narrated by the male lead Howard Keel is facinating to watch following the movie. The improved dolby sound is also strikingly better than I remembered from watching it on Cable TV"
5,Men were men!,Seven Brides... is definitely one of my favorite movies of all times. Men settled the west. They had strength and stamina and they were not afraid to take what they needed to survive. They also knew the value of a strong woman.
5,A great cinematic masterpiece!,"I have been watching that musical since I was kneehigh to a grasshopper. It is my all time favorite. The songs are fresh, and wonderful and the dancing is simply inspirational!"
5,A sing-along movie,"I'm only 16 years old and I've been a fan of this movie for as long as I can remember. I love the music, I love the plot, I love the actors, and I love pretty much everything about it! I would very HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who likes a good classic."
3,Fabulous musical but poor edition,This is my favorite musical of all time but I was greatly disappointed in the quality of the 'special edition' DVD. The colors were muddy and grey and not nearly as vibrant and beautiful as my 20 year old VHS tape.
5,LOVE IT,I love this movie. It is so funny and the characters are marvelous. I am only 22years old and I think that there should be more comidies like this around. Ones where people aren't making fun of others faults and ones where there isn't a lot of cursing and carring on. I love this movie I would recommend it to anyone who loves good clean entertainment.
2,Haven't They Heard of Restoration???,"Although the original film, ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" was a marvelous blending of music, dance and the old pioneer days, this DVD transfer is a disaster. With today's technology, you would think that someone might have struck an anamorphic edition that would expand beyond the realm of 4x3 TV. The color was washed out, there was no dynamics in the sound, and the print looked almost as if no one bothered to look at the negative before it was transferred. I could feel the dirt falling off of the disc. (My old laserdisc edition looked better than this copy). In short, ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers""is a great musical that deserves a restoration before the transfer. BTW, wonderful performance by young Russ Tamblyn (of West Side Story fame)."
5,A classic!,"How can anyone not love this movie? A true classic for those who loves the musicals from the 50's, and why we can't get these anymore!The predecessor of movies like West Side Story, Grease and even SNF. The script is a little thin, but this isn't a drama, there's lots of dancing and music. The 6.5 minute barn scene is just a riot. If you love classics and you haven't seen this one, you must get it."
5,Seven Brides and Seven Brothers,The product was delivered in a reasonable time with reasonable quality.The purchase was smooth and without problems.
5,My purchase from Amazon .com,"I thought I would never find this movie---Seven Brides for Seven Brothers---until a friend said....you haven't tried amazon.com. I did , it was there and I am 100 pct satisfied and thrilled. I boughttwo, one for me, and one for my daughter that loves the movie as much as I do."
3,"Nice DVD, but no book?","I couldn't wait for this to arrive! Typically, with a two-disc special edition, you get lots of extra features and a book. The features were okay, but no book in the dvd. Hmmm, at this price, I felt slightly ripped off.The movie, though, looks and sounds gorgeous."
2,Not a 2 disk Set,"I saw the picture and thought it was the ""Two Disc Special"". The movie is great I was just expecting the other disk! Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (Two-Disc Special Edition) but it's $21.34."
5,Awesome,"The movie came on time, perfect condition, will totally buy from this buyer if I need to again :)"
3,Get the Widescreen Version,"Yes, I agree with all the glowing reviews. Our whole family, including young boys, LOVE this movie. We've watched it many times. However, we bought the regular VHS version, and they lost a lot in the formatting. You frequently hear actors speaking who are not on screen.So our advice: buy the widescreen so you can see all seven brothers at the same time.Our family has decided to buy a DVD player just so we can get this film in the DVD version.SG"
5,Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"Featuring a slew of fabulous dancers, including a young Russ Tamblyn later (Riff in ""West Side Story""), the movie's an adrenaline rush of vibrant hues and non-stop motion. Though the songs by Gene De Paul and Johnny Mercer are catchy, the real attraction here is Michael Kidd's matchless choreography. The barn-raising sequence alone is one of the outstanding sequences in all musical film. Exuberant, infectious fun."
4,Entertaining,"This is one of the most entertaining musicals on film. It's goofy, and you'll laugh a few times (if not just because of some of the stunts). The songs are catchy, and kids love it. If you want a musical that won't leave you bored, this is the one for you."
5,Family Favorite,"This is one of my sisters and I's favorite musicals. Witty, funny, and full of great music. We fall in love with the characters over and over. We were so excited to be able to now own it on DVD!"
2,Great movie. POOR quality picture!,I love this movie but it needs to be redone because the picture is all fuzzy and the sound is awful. Glad I bought this movie but wish it was higher quality.
4,fun and entertaining,This movie really surprised me as being really funny and smart and the music and dance numbers just make smile all the the way through the film. I can watch this over and over again. Love this movie! !
2,Very disappointed in the picture quality,I have expected for a digitally remastered quality of the pictureI have ordered for this even if I have one of the same movie withme. but the picture quality is even worse than my old copy.Very disappointed !!!!
5,Awesome movie,"Just wish it was a little clearer. The movie was great my teenage girls loved it 16 & 14! I rented it , got it with in minutes it was great!"
5,I love this movie,"Used to watch this all the time as a kid, over and over, nearly pee'd my panties when I saw it on Amazon Prime. Watched it once so far... contemplating a second showing! How can you not like a movie where a women is named Dorkus?"
5,Love this movie!,This has always been my favorite musical.I could watch it over and over again. You never grow tiredof the songs.
5,A great Family movie!,This movie is one of our families favorite movies. We watch it often. The songs are rip-roaring. The laughably bad sets just add to the fun. This one should be up with all other movies you love. The dancing is good and although the plot is rather dumb it is still a great movie that will have you laughing all the way through. So kick up your heels and soon you'll be singing along with the Sobbin women and everyone else.
5,My Absolute Favorite Movie,"This is my favorite movie, and in fact my family yells at me when I turn it on, because they've seen it so many times. The music and the dancing will keep you swingin' the whole time. After you see this you'll also want the CD!!"
1,Seven brides for seven brothers,"The listing for this particular movie is incorrect. Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor were never in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers-they were in Singin in the Rain."
2,DVD of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"If you are supplying DVD's to addresses in Europe you should make sure that they are correctly ""Regionaly coded""The copy you sent is coded"" 1 "" which I presume is for America but unplayable on the majority of players in EuropeAs the purchase was for a Christmass present,it was a great disappointment when the recipient was unable to watch it.Unable to review your product as it is not possible to look at it.Not sure if I will use Amazon again, it was a very embarassing experience."
1,"Dopey, tedious, laughable","I'd heard great things about this musical and was supremely disappointed upon watching it. The story is insipid, the acting lame, the music forgettable at best. There's one great dance sequence at the barn raising (which is why it gets one star rather than none or negative stars). Every time one of the actors broke into song, we laughed derisively as it's worked so poorly into the story line and the singing is so insipid. If every copy of this film vanished off the face of the earth, it would be doing humankind a favor."
1,"""Bless her beautiful heart""-For STAYING AWAY FROM THIS MESS!","This film is terrible. All of the songs are horribly written and sung, and the film's dancing scenes are horribly choreographed (except for the scene at the barn raising). And the acting, let's just not go there! Trust me on this one. SKIP IT! Grade: F"
5,"Great introduction to & history of tantra, beautiful artwork","The author of this book has written a fascinating study of tantric ideas and practices, focusing on their relation to gnosis, ie., mystical knowledge of god acquired via the winding left-hand path.Apparently the author was upset when her book was published - it has been marred (gasp!) by the inclusion of dozens and dozens of beautiful, full color illustrations of hindu religious and erotic artwork.I hope I'm not out of line in suggesting that, from the standpoint of the reader, the artwork is a GOOD THING. Actually, this is the best single source of information conmnection tantra with gnosticism I have have ever seen AND the best single collection of indian erotica I have ever seen.TWO BOOKS IN ONE! YEAH!"
1,Skip this single,"I love the band and saw this single on sale for just over a dollar, so I decided to take a chance. The a-side is the exact same, minute-long track featured on the debut album. The title of the b-side implies that it might be a demo or early version of ""Let's Get Sandy."" In fact, it's just the male members of the band doing an improvised rap over a rudimentary hip-hop beat. It's the kind of goof that never should have been released, even as the b-side to an obscure single. No reason to pick this up."
5,SO REPULSIVE IT RULES,"gore soaked lyrics and unearthly guttural growls broken hope are fine example of gory death/grinding metal.this album is grotesque songs such as siamese screams,auction of the dead ,and the cloning.fans of mortician and cannibal corpse will just love these guys i do they are so awesome that i highly recomend them to fans of this type of stuff ..get this and fill your ears to the max with gory metal.cya"
2,"slow, boring, and pointless...","...this music drags along aimlessly without any point, and is no more ""brutal"" than any other death cd out there. Do not waste your money. if you want real death, try Cannibal Corpse, Carcass, Death, or Hypocrisy."
4,Does what it is made to do,"Good filter that fits nicely on my Canon 17-40 wide angle. Only downside is that, being a slim fit, doesn't allow for the Canon lens cap to fit on the lens any more--B+W does include a rubber lens cap that fits on to replace the canon one, but it doesn't fit quite as securely. Guess that's just the price to pay."
4,Solid Starting Point,"I'd say it's a good book to start on if you're interested in Zen. After this, you could go onto another book written by Watts called ""The Way of Zen"". This book was pretty easy to understand and doesn't go into anything that is too confusing. It's a quick read though, so I don't think I'd recommend buying the $30 version. I picked mine up at a used book store for much less than half that. Not one of my favorites of books that Watts has wrote, but he wasn't as wise as he was in his later years. Overall pretty good though."
5,Great suff Carlos,"Just like Carlos this scent is very unique. I think for the price it's worth it. It doesn't seem to have a long hang time,"
3,mature cologne Carlos Santana By Carlos Santana,Really like the smellCarlos Santana By Carlos Santana For Men. Cologne Spray 3.4 oz gave it to my son.
5,smothered in smooth,"this stuff smells like heaven on earth. i love it! I'm not sure what the ingredients are but it's a good mix. i wish i knew what to compare it too as far as smells go,but I don't. i say give it a try,you won't be disappointed."
5,Carlos Santana cologne,Carlos Santana Carlos Santana 3.4 oz Fine Cologne Spray For Menlike bold fresh smell of this cologne stays with you thru out day
5,Everyone Loves this Cologne,this is my third bottle of Santana in the past 5 years...everyone always asks me what I'm wearing - they all agree it is a wonderful cologne - especially the women!!
2,too sweet,"There were a lot of good reviews so I took a chance on the cologne due to the low price, but it was too sweet for my liking and I just didn't care for it. Maybe it's just not for me. I still use it from time to time due to the fact that I already bought it and it's usable, but I just don't feel content that it's just okay."
4,Have not used it much yet...but I am happy,"I purchased a lot of colognes all at once on Amazon,so I have not used this product much, but it seems nice.Obviously it will not be as glamorous or have the longlasting smell as a really expensive cologne, but for theprice this is still a dynamite deal!!!!"
3,ABC Jersey cradle sheet,"The ABC jersey cradle sheet was ordered for a visit from our brand new grandbaby. I bought two of these sheets, one pink and one green. They fit (barely) pulling up the corners of the cradle mattress until they were stretched out by hand and smoothed out. They are thinner than I would have liked, but they seemed to do the trick. They fit much better than the Gerber cradle sheets I also bought, which were so small they would not allow the cradle mattress to lie flat. I had thought all cradle mattresses would be standard-sized, hence why I wondered why all of these sheets were constructed so skimpily.I am glad I bought them, however, and we've used them extensively for the baby this holiday visit.If you buy a cradle, these are the only sheets I could find that seem to fit, and you'll want to also purchase a mattress pad for underneath."
4,Feel good party rock!,"These guys rock! They sound like they were drunk when they recorded this record. They're even better live. Lots of mistakes and equipment problems. They usually yell at each other, too. Their crowd is rowdy and hurls insults at everyone in sight. Jonny Chan thinks he's the leader but the real secret weapon is their bass player Tommy Jade. I think Jonny is secretly jealous of him. If you like Foghat, you'll love the Dynasty."
3,No need to catch this movie,The physical movie itself is fine. We are satisfied with the product. The movie itself had way too many gaps in the logic. Crammed too many messages into 1 movie and didn't do a good job at any of them.
5,Great western adventure,"Great story, easy reading lots of action and suspense. Looking forward to reading more of willam johnstones booksHighly reccommended"
4,Good reference work,This little book is an outstanding reference book for anyone interested in identifying the various stone points found through out PE NYS and northeastern North America. Very well illustrated. Excellent descriptions. People wanting to ID NYS points will be hard pressed to find a more compact resorse. The book is small enough to be taken and used afield by those fortunate enough to have such need. Unfortunatly the quality of production does not match the quality of content. From the first opening the spine broke loose and loose pages began to fall out. The inferior production quality is the only thing preventing me from giving this wonderful little book a solid 5 stars.
2,fell apart!,"i want to preface this review as nothing negative about Ritchie's work. he is recognized as an essential author to anybody who studies or works in archaeology in new york state. the negative review has to do with the publishing company and their poor standards of how a book should physically be put together.i work in archaeology so i was hoping to use this book, as many do, as a field reference guide. unfortunately before even taking it into the field i realized that this book wasn't going to survive very long sitting on a book shelf let alone being used in the field. the very first time i opened the book the binding gave up and pages started falling out left and right. i ended up putting a comb binding on the book just to make it usable. so if you're buying this version just be aware that there may be some assembly required."
3,Not enough information,"It's a good book but I expect more. The tips are good but too basic, everyone with common sense should have figured it out. I need more tips on on how we can make a sound overall investment from the studio and how we can sell the studio and employee the operators. It's OK but should be more elaboration on the experience."
3,Short and Semi-Sweet,"I am a software business owner who is also starting a new recording studio business. The book, which has a lot fewer pages then I expected, covers business basics that would apply to most service businesses - things like how to quote prices, write proposals, and send invoices. It also emphasizes believing in yourself and having confidence in your business, which is a challenge for any business owner. I believe real-life success is a better basis for confidence then you-can-do-it speeches, but I appreciate the author's intent there. I'd say the book would be useful for someone who enjoys studio technology but has no experience operating a business."
5,Make Money With Your Studio: Setting Up and Operating a Suc,The book was easy to read and gave good advice for someone venturing into the home studio business.
2,Beware: Item not as pictured or described.,"I was very disappointed in this product. Nowhere in the picture or description is anything to lead you to believe that this car comes mounted on a cheap boring stand. Seller was unwilling to refund unless I returned item at my own expense. Seller was quite clear that they knew their description and picture of item was inaccurate, and they expressed no interest in correcting this dishonesty! Also, item is not as well made as description would suggest. For example, front hood barely opens. For an item that is over $40 with shipping I'd look elsewhere if I had it to do again."
2,Worked great for about a month,"This swing worked great for about a month and was even a bit fast for a newborn. But now it will barely swing. It works when the swing is empty but as soon as I put my 14 lb baby in it, the swing barely moves...and the glider doesn't move at all. I'm disappointed to say the least."
3,Pretty Good Swing,"We just purchased this swing for our 6 week old daughter, and were honestly a little disappointed. Fisher Price just missed out a few opporutnities to make this the perfect swing: it would be great if the tray had some little toys on it, and the mobile should rotate or something. It also took a bit of time to assemble--not that it was too difficult, but there were just a lot of parts to make sense of. I do love that you can plug it in, and the colors are really nice. It is very sturdy, too."
1,"Cute, but stopped working after only a few uses","After about 2 weeks of use, this swing got weaker and weaker until it wouldn't swing at all, even with brand new batteries. What a waste! It's cute, but worthless. I was upset that I'd spent over $100 on something that stopped working almost immediately."
1,It had an electrical plug (built into or replacing a battery holder) and no way to know that from the ad picture or text.,Most wall clocks are battery operated and apparently this one was originally. I was totally inappropriate for my needs. I could not use it. There should have been a better indication that there was a plug on it.
1,clock,i received clock on time that was the only thing on time i pluged it in i went back to look at the clock it had run about ten nin. and stop you want me to send you $8.00 if i send it back forget it
4,"Kelly's Lot, lots of good music","I bought this CD since I received a free one from the band that only had a few songs on it (part of some promotion or something) It is well worth the small price, the tracks on it ROCK. My favorite is ""Joan of Arc"" and ""Black and Blue"". The remake of ""brand new key"" leaves a bit to be desired, but it's better than the original by far. If you like blues, I recommend it. If you like rock, I recommend it. If you like strong female vocalists that sound comfortable with the lyrics, I recommend it."
2,Earthling - Tony Daniel,"Earthling is an amusing little read but that's about it. The idea is not especially original and the execution is poor. Written in three sections, Earthling lacks coherence and refuses to yield a single remarkable character. If you want good science fiction, look elsewhere."
1,Horrifically painful,I highly recommend this book to masochists. The lack of any coherent plot really allows the book to go into compeltely unpredictable areas.
4,Vaughan SBP5 Professional Magnetic Tack Hammer,"I bought the Vaughan SBP5 Professional Magnetic Tack Hammer from Home Depot in 2010 for $8.93. I wanted a tack hammer with a ""nylon tip"", but I refused to pay $30.00 dollars. So I bought the Vaughan and attached a self adhesive felt pad to the head.It's a hammer--it works--what more can I say."
4,A Book Review by my 3rd Grade Students,"Pippi in the South Seas is a great book. You should read it sometime. The character's names are: Pippi Longstocking, a boy named Tommy, a girl named Annika, and Pippi's dad ""Fat White Chief"". The main character is Pippi Longstocking. She is very crazy. She is very strong too.The story is about Pippi, Annika, and Tommy going to an island because Pippi's dad is a sailor. The island is called Kurrekurredutt Island. Pippi and her friends go to the island and have an adventure. Tommy went in the water and found a shark swimming near him! The shark scraped his teeth against Tommy's leg! Pippi threw the shark in the air and the shark went back in the water.We really enjoyed reading this book and think you would too."
2,Pippi Longstocking: Pippi in the South Seas,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loves Pippi but was disappointed with the film. It was confusing to him because the dubbing was not in sync with the movement of the lips of the actors. I think it is difficult for children to understand the language conversion process. It is an enjoyable film but not anything to get real excited about.
2,Give the gift of Pippi,"I bought it as a gift for a ""secret Santa"". I have no idea of what the recipient thinks of it. I just hope they were not disappointed."
4,Does its job very nice,"I bought this card for capturing video from my Sony MiniDV Video Camera.When I first got it, I run to my laptop(Thinkpad T42) to test it, but all the excitment turned into a big dissapointment when I couldn't make it work.I thought that I should have payed more attention to the reviews here. But as stubborn as I am, I search on the Internet for a solution to the problem.Meanwhile I tested the card on my other Laptop(Dell) and found out that the problem was my Thinkpad, because it worked perfectly on the Dell Laptop.After a lot of research I found out that in order to make it work on my Thinkpad, I had to disable the PCI Power Management Bios Option.After that the card worked on my Thinkpad too and I am actually very happy with it.Hope this helps someone else!"
1,MAYBE you will get it to work,"I'm using this card with a WD My Book external hard drive. The SIIG manual says to install their 1394 driver. Well it didn't work. After returning the hard drive and getting a new one (which didn't help) I tried using the Windows default Texas Instruments OHCI Compliant IEEE 1394 Host Controller driver. It now works. Bottom line, their driver is a joke and forget about finding any useful information on their website."
3,Newer is not necessarily better.,"This book could be viewed as an abridged/updated version of the classic earlier text by the author. However, it has significantly less content than the earlier book. I'm not sure what to make of this book. No overall consistent theme. Some topics treated in an ad-hoc manner. The book is ok if you already know the material, but I can see that it would be difficult and confusing for a beginner in this field.It appears to me that this book was written in order to remove all of the rigorous mathematical details of the Richtmyer and Morton book on Finite Difference Methods. I would not use this as a text for any course in numerical PDE. As strange as this may sound, books on CFD tend to do a better job at numerical analysis but a poor job at CFD! I would shop around until you find something you feel comfortable with. This one just doesn't do it for me."
2,Problem with order,"I ordered this product, but received a different product than the one I ordered (and I did recheck my order). Now it is difficult to locate the seller to make any kind of exchange. Amazon doesn't handle these requests. So now I am stuck with the wrong bottle! I have used the Magnesium Citrate for many years, so I know it is a good product! I give it 2 stars for being a good product, but unfortunately the seller made a mistake that wasn't handled."
4,Hand me the remote control.,"This is a collection of 65 TV themes from the '70s and '80s. They all seem to be the original versions of the themes, unlike some of the earlier volumes in the series, which had some rerecordings. These are the TV shows I grew up with, so there is a lot of nostalgia here for me. I like the sitcom themes the best, because that is mostly what I watched when I was a kid. A lot of them are really cheesy, but I love 'em. If you watched too much TV during the '70s and '80s, you will probably get a kick out of this CD."
3,"It's got ""Mr. Belvedere""!","Listen, this isn't the strongest entry in the television theme song pantheon, but for including ""Mr. Belvedere,"" the ""Monday Night Football"" theme (which always makes me feel like going back to school and playing in the leaves...), ""Siskel & Ebert"" AND ""The People's Court,"" it gets my vote of confidence. Buy this and listen to it in the comfort of your home on a Sunday afternoon when all the reruns on TV are worthless and you need to be reminded of your childhood. (That is, if your childhood was the late '70s and early '80s.)"
4,Most are originals (for a change for this series),"This is the first of this series that offers mostly (not all) original renditions of the TV theme songs.Maybe it's because many of these were by stars or singers who are known by the public, but whatever the reason this edition is a big improvement.I would NOT recommend ANY of the earlier volumes in this series if you're seriously looking for original recordings."
4,The Best in the Series...So Far...,"I own this specific CD in addition to Television's Greatest Hits (70's & 80's). In my opinion, volume 6 is the best in the entire series. It contains cool themes like Monday Night Football, Knight Rider (with no voice-over), and the Benny Hill Show!But, none of those marketing record geniuses have yet to put a CD out that contains the themes of: The Transformers (great 80's cartoon), the NBA on NBC, the NFL on CBS, Entertainment Tonight (and I don't mean the lame version they play today or the one found on the 70's and 80's cd version), NBC Nightly News, CNBC MarketWrap theme, some good game show themes like Double Dare, Match Game, and maybe even some themes from ESPN SportsCenter.Do they do that? Noooo....they have to include classics like All in the Family and Alice. Good shows, but not good music. Anyway this is a great CD. If you like TV music, you should give this one a try."
4,Good CD.,"This CD along with Vol 7 is the best in the Television's Greatest Hits collection! Vol 6 has some very good themes, Night Court, Growing Pains, Charles In Charge, Who's The Boss, The Golden Girls, Mork & Mindy, Family Ties, etc, but I think my favorite of all is The Golden Girls which I like to watch on Lifetime TV."
3,Great CD With 1 Disappointment,"Love most of the songs, but I specifically bought it for the theme to ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" only to find out it's a shortened instrumental only version & NOT the incredible full length theme sung by Dionne Warwick. Can't find that version anywhere so far. Any help is welcome!"
4,Works as well as name brand,"These tests worked just as well as the more expensive store bought tests. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because, I wouldn't give the name brand tests 5 stars either. Too hard to tell if a very visable yet slightly lighter test line means +. According to a digital test that I took simultaneously, it does, yet the directions state the line must be the same color or darker. But now that I know this, I think the tests are very good for the $."
3,i dont know,i would say these work but im not sure. i have an irregular cycle so i purchased this to see what day i would ovulate. i followed the instructions and on cycle day 14 the test said positive for a lh surge. so me and my BF ..you know.... and i did not become pregnant! (bummer) so i would rate this a three because im not sure if this test is innacurate for the LH surge or maybe i didnt ovulate that cycle. im gonna try first response ovulation predictor next time
1,two many wrenches of the same size,I received two of the 14 mm wrenches . One was in place of the 1/2 wrench . I tried to contact the company and had no luck . Im stuck with ntwo 14mm wrenchs of this set. Bummer.
2,Smelly,"I received this set. All the tools were as described; however, it smelled like moth balls. I tried everything to get rid of the smell. After 1 year, I had to get throw it away, since the smell was so strong."
2,don't buy this item,"These wrenches look cheap , worst than "" Pittsburgh"". Cost for return almost charge 50% price. They were made in India,that's why."
3,Right and Wrong,"Not a bad wrench set, although, unfortunately I thought I was ordering ignition wrenches. Maybe I missed the list of sizes. (I just went back to the description and don't see sizes listed.) It LOOKS like an ignition wrench set if you can't tell the scale, and the one you can read is 5/16-- would be at the large end in an ignition wrench set although rather being than the smallest in a standard set."
3,Kevin,"THey are very cheap wrenches but they will turn nuts and bolts. They probably won't handle alot of torque. My summary would be ""You get what you pay for""."
4,Tools,To be honest I haven't had the chance to really use these tools to there fullest capabilities. I have no dought that they will be more than enough to get the job done. They we're a good price to.
5,great buy,"For the price these are ablsolutely perfet. They have SO many different sizes I couldn't have asked for more. My boyfriend loved them, came with a convenient case you can even hang them on the wall. Best deal for the money, I searched everywhere on every site and this was the right purchase."
3,"Duplicates of some wrenches, (10MM) and shortages in others,(7/16)","Duplicates and shortages show a lack of quality control in packaging. I noted this same complaint from another customer, who also reported it without any remedial action forthcoming."
4,great product for the money,"These are very well made, lifetime garranty wrenchs. The price is the real reason I bought them. The wrench set is made in india, appears to be of very high quality and they do say they stand behind them. For someone that needs tools, but doesn't have to use them everyday, these are perfect. If you have to use your tools everyday, I recommend getting something that you can have replaced very quickly if something were to happen (like the same day). These were purchased to be kept inside of my vehicle so that I can have some tools just in case something were to happen, for that they are perfect."
3,duplicate wrenches as with other reviews,"got package in today, had 2 5/16 wrenches,was missing 1/4, also had duplicate 14 mm and was missing 15mm. the wrenches seem that they will be ok for house hold chores,comes in a nice carrying case that smells like the pool floaties or innertube you get from walmart to play in pools with,other than the duplicate wrenches, price seems fair for all the wrenches received,and this is how i see it, review is now over"
2,missing tool,"yeeeaahh....received two 13mm and didn't get a 12mm. i don't even know how that happens. I give it two stars because, well, it's pretty critical to get all the correct pieces into it. Overall, the price was right, I do like the carrying pouch and they seem sturdy enough for what I need. sure would like to have had a 12 mm though..."
5,Love this wrench set!,My first real good wrench set for working on my vehicle(s). I went by the reviews of others and went ahead with this Tekton set. Very sturdy; feels great in the hands and looks unused after multiple uses already. I like the pouch too for finding the right size fast.
5,Solid,"Good set of spanners,I have applied a lot of torque to these spanners even used a breaker bar over the 24mm, very solid very impressed.The spanners themselves are nice and thick, good quality.Very handy set were a socket wont fit."
4,"A good supplemental set of wrenches - appropriate for beginners, too","I already have a rather complete set of both SAE and metric combination wrenches, but there are times that, because of limited clearance issues, combination wrenches on both sides of a connection are necessary. This set includes most of the commonly-used sizes, and, if a beginner is starting a set, most of what he'll need until he's ready to take on the ""big jobs"", larger or smaller sizes can be added individually as the need arises. I don't know how long-lived the finish will be, but the wrenches appear sufficiently substantial and accurately-sized for all but the most demanding applications. It's no less than a good set to start with, and a welcome addition to my toolbox."
2,Also Missing Wrenches,"Like other reviewers, I am also missing a wrench. How hard is it to place the correct wrenches in a pouch? This one's going back."
1,No one agrees with Brian Phillips's review,"After coming across a review somewhere that praised Complaint in the Garden, I decided to read the book myself--and I found it to be one of the best new books of poetry that I've seen. Later, I came across at least five other reviews, all overwhelmingly positive (including Floyd Collins's review in http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/gettysburg_review/Back_Issues/174.htm)--except for this one. Phillips's review is an anamoly for a reason: Complaint in the Garden is magnificent and deserves the praise that it has been given by everyone else who has reviewed it."
2,Few sequals are good,"The obvious SF instance is DUNE. Same here.Collapsium was a fun SuperScience romp, with some rather nice tongue-in-cheek social comedy.The rest of the series is disappointing: it's as if McCarthy, having invented his world and its technology, felt he had to keep writing in that universe.The result is a sort of grim plod... rather like a sociology text set as a novel. With none of the joyful dance of ideas and language of ""Collapsium"".As with Dune: read the first, then stop."
2,hard to enjoy a book when i hate the main character,"I couldn't stand this book. Well I read the whole thing, but it was painful. Prince Bascal is such a psychopath it really was no fun to read. Conrad's character was well done, multi-faceted and believable and I'm glad to have gotten to know him but on the whole this book came terribly close to ruining the series for me."
3,Great!!,Great read for anyone going through infertility or trying to adopt. I love this series. Emma is as always a little naive and you almost feel sorry for her husband with all his drama but still very true to life and fun.
4,Looks are deceiving!,"This is a great product, and has greatly reduced the stomach upset in our 8 cats- but they need to have a picture of the actual product on here- that says 200 grams/7 oz., instead of the 1 lb bottle they're showing! I thought I had ordered a 1 lb bottle of it, based on the picture!"
1,How many!,"Does this include ""TWO"" steps or just one. One image shows two steps but there is no commentary on this."
2,Not for sensitive skin,"I was excited to get this product because I had been using the eye cream and thought it was very helpful, but I was unable to use any of these products because my skin was too senstive. I am not sure what incrediant(s) might have beenthe contributing factor, but I ended up throwing this away and purchasing bare essential products."
3,It was good til it died,"I've had many different products from Logitech before (mice, webcams, keyboards) and have for the most part been very satisfied with the quality of them. This mouse was ok for the first several months, it worked quite nicely and it replaced a Logitech corded mouse on my desktop, I wanted a little more versatility a way to 'cut the cord' and be able to use the mouse in different positions that wouldn't have been possible with the corded one.After swapping out the batteries and discovering that the mouse was indeed deceased after about 4 months, I was forced to go back to my corded mouse which I've had for about 2 years. It too was an optical mouse, and hasn't given me a lick of trouble, I was a little surprised that this mouse died so quickly, to be completely honest."
1,"NICE DOOR PHOTOS,....BUT","If you are looking for information about San Miguel, this book does NOT provide it! Very little written...too many door photos!"
5,For verse-lovers,"I'll be honest: I haven't read any other verse translation all the way through. Why? I can't get over this one.""And then the season of summer with the soft winds,When Zephyr sighs low over seeds and shoots;Glad is the green plant growing abroad,When the dew at dawn drops from the leaves,To get a gracious glance from the golden sun.But harvest with harsher winds follows hard after,Warns him to ripen well ere winter comes;Drives forth the dust in the droughty season,From the face of the fields to fly high in air.Wroth winds in the welkin wrestle with the sun,The leaves launch from the linden and light on the ground,And the grass turns to gray, that once grew green.Then all ripens and rots that rose up at first,And so the year moves on in yesterdays many,And winter once more, by the world's law,draws nigh.At Michaelmas the moonHangs wintry pale in sky;Sir Gawain girds him soonFor travails yet to try.""Just, come on. That's awesome."
4,Tale of Deception,I enjoyed this magical insight into the life of Gawain and the deceptions that he faced although the Green Knight was not as evil as one may think. The fact that the poet uses women as cunning and deceptive tools also facinated me.
1,terrible,they sent me a totally different edition in different translation. It is totally different. They should've at least told me.
4,Interesting Ideas In A Loosely Formed Story,"Although I enjoyed the book, I did get the strong impression that the plot was very much secondary to the ideas that Poul Anderson is interested in: human nature and evolution, artificial intelligence and its evolution, free will, destiny, etc. The fate of carbon-based intelligence vs. silicon-based intelligence is a theme in many books, fiction and nonfiction, and Mr. Anderson's contribution is very readable. You might try Hans Moravec's nonfiction speculations, or Dan Simmons' Endymion Series, or Robert Jastrow's now classic ""The Enchanted Loom: Mind in the Universe"" to name a few."
2,Hasn't stood up well,"Even when I first read this book, I was underwhelmed. The characters aren't particularly complicated or interesting, and the different sections of the book (more like sutured-together novellas) are so different that there is little coherent conflict or plot. The technology described in the book (human-mind uploads, god-like computers) was interesting then, but ten years later, it's old news. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,"TV's Hits, Volume 4","I was specifically looking for the ""Naked City"" theme. The theme is done beautifully. However, it does not play the entire theme. I was expecting the entire theme. Other than that, it is a great CD."
2,Not My Favorite!,"A few years ago when I was in a TV theme phase I got all the Television's Greatest Hits CD's and most of the collection is good but I was disappointed with Vol 4, probably because I have never heard the majority of these themes and I was bored with The CD, the only themes I have ever heard are Lassie, Make Room For Daddy, Father Knows Best, Ozzie and Harriet, Davy Crocket, Gunsmoke, The Fugitive, The Untouchables, and Candid Camera, the rest are TV shows that I have never seen syndicated reruns of so I don't know their themes. I guess a person should just stick with the Television's Greatest Hits CD's that have themes of TV shows that they actually grew up watching or saw on Nick at Nite or TVland."
2,This soundtrack doesn't offer the best clips,If this soundtrack had more clips that went with the themes to shows it would be of higher interest to customers.
1,Green Ranger Axe-Not durable!!,"Whoever labeled this toy as durable either doesn't have kids or never took it out of the package! The green part that sticks out from the base of the axe broke within the first minute out of the package following a small drop right after my son started playing with it. What a big disappointment for my 4 year-old who was already in his green ranger costume.. Nonetheless, pretty soon he engaged back into playing even though the axe was...injured. Within a few minutes there was another breakage at the end of the base. Instead of returning it, I coated the end of the handle with durable black tape and he was able to play with it much longer without any more accidents. He loves it eventhough it's being mended twice! He is a real Power Ranger fan! I recommend the Disney power ranger toys which are made of compacted foamy plastic instead"
5,Contents,"Since neither amazon nor anybody else seems to know what this is i'll explain it:its an import box set that contains:We're in this together #1, #2, #3.all in seperate cases, the same 3 listed for $12 a peice here on amazonA NIN drink coaster, A NIN T-Shirt, A NIN Keyring & A NIN Stickernone of which are available anywhere elseI hope that helps peolpe in deciding wether or not to purchase this item!"
3,Not an official release.,"For the amount of $$ that they are asking for this release, I don't feel that it is worth it. Buy the 3 official parts to the WITT single, but buying this Damaged box set gives money to someone who is trying to leech off of Trent. Certainly, if you want the extras then go ahead, but don't get them expecting the level of quality that object merchandise ... and NIN put into their official releases. The singles - and music on the singles - are great, but I would rather save the extra money to buy rare official stuff."
4,Forget the Sticker.,"The sticker is a joke, it's a very un-sharp copy (a Xerox copy, for that matter) of an Helvetica font or something on a standard white office copy paper with an adhesives on the back. It wasn't even cut straight, someone obviously took the trouble of using some scissors, for whatever reason.So, don't look forward to the sticker. All else is OK."
5,Great CD,Very High Quality theme songs and that makes it a very good CD which makes those TV shows from the 70s and 80s with themes on it are in much better quality than on TV. I really like it.
5,This CD is a lot of fun,"This CD has the original songs from your favorite TV shows. Not remakes of these songs like other CD's. It's a couch potato's heaven. Definitely has to be one of the most fun CD's I have! If a party is not going well, I bring this CD out and play ""Name that TV show"" and people have a blast!"
5,Great CD!,Climbing the Heap was an awesome song! The CD is worth the price just for this song. Great drumming!
4,Parenting: Part Joy Part Guerilla Warfare,"As a mother of three children under the age of eight, there's not much time to sit and read parenting books. Parenting: Part Joy, Part Guerrilla Warfare provides brief,sometimes inspirational, sometimes humorous and always true snipets of advice for those of us in the midst of this wonderful roller coaster of a ride known as parenting. I pick it up whenever I need a boost, a smile or assurance that indeed I am not the only person who experiences the joys and warfare of parenting. I intend to buy multiple copies to give as gifts. Every Parent should own this little gem."
1,Not about the current release,Started using this book to set up win 2K-server. found that what the book showed and what I saw on the screen were two different things. This book was probably written with an early beta of Win 2K server. I am bringing it back to borders.
5,The history of American Bridges,"America's bridges are beautiful. This book provides a history of the materials used for construction, the designs of a great many American engineers, and photos of many, many bridges. There is also a comparison of the bridges of America and those of Europe. Now somebody needs to bring all this up through the outstanding bridges of very recent years."
2,Awful movie!,"In this movie, a Cuban-American woman learns to love Cuban men and Cuban culture. I liked that this movie promoted embracing one's heritage. However, that's where the good stuff stops. The acting in this flick is TERRIBLE! The actors had no timing whatsoever. The romance is rushed. The male love interest has such a perfect jaw that it obviously must be a result of cosmetic surgery. It should be stressed that this movie promoted cultural pride, not racial pride. All the Cubans in this film are white. All the Black and mixed Cubans, both in the US and on the island, are totally absent. I find this incredibly problematic. Some of the subtitles on the DVD are mistranslated or spelled wrong. Further, at a time when one out of every three Latinos marries an Anglo, I'm surprised this film was made. I'm not sure how people in multiracial families or interracial couples will feel about this piece."
5,Awsome Movie,This movie is sooo awsome! Its a grwat movie about staying in contact with your latin heritage! It was also ... a funny movie. I especially like it because my aunt was in it. Jaqueline Torres! You may know her from F-X the series. I definnently recommend this movie.
4,Works as advertised,"This is a very good product that works, I had to convert 80 VHS tapes to digital on a Mac Pro into IMOVIE for burning to DVD. Simple to set up using the Composite Video and The standard audio cable connections to VCR. The resolution was very good considering the tapes go back to 1986 and were not in the best condition. I am very satisfied with the resolution using the ADVC-55I have Tried using less expensive A to D converters with very poor results, the resolution was so poor that the movies were unusable. I gave 4 stars because no matter what I did, I could not get the S-Video to work and the documentation is a joke."
4,NO MORE DUBBING DISEASE,The audio and the lips are now in sync. No more looking a a movie that looks poorly dubbed. $174.00 yes. But you do get what you pay for. Too bad it does not come with any software but then again if you want to do video editing you need something that you know has to be better than free software
5,Fantastic Product,"I was looking for a simple, easy to use product that could convert VHS tapes and footage directly from an old camera onto my MacBook and I stumbled upon this product. After weeks of research, and trying a cheaper and much more inefficient product on a PC, I decided to buy this product. When it arrived I took it out of the box, hooked up the cables, and it works like a dream. Now I can directly import footage into iMovie and there is no need for other software or even a power cord - since it is powered by the Firewire port on my MacBook. This is a great, no-nonsense product from a company that has a long history of producing the industry standard in recording and converting footage. I strongly suggest purchasing this product."
2,Only 352x240 resolution!,"I'm very disappointed. I thought I was getting a device that would convert an NTSC signal into digital at NTSC resolution, but it doesn't do that. The output from this device is only 352x240 which is about half of NTSC resolution.Most software will tell you it is larger, but it's just scaling the image up. The native data coming from the device is just 352x240 which is TINY."
4,Small and effective,"Great little box for analog to digital conversion.Pros: Small size, ease of use, no external power necessary.Cons: No cables supplied other than 6-pin firewire which most computers have now outgrown (be sure to get a 6-pin to 9-pin firewire cable instead), only RCA and S-video inputs, editing software supplied is for Windows machines only. If you have a Mac, you'll need iMovie, FCP or another capture solution.There are other good A/d solutions out there in the same price range that are a bit more flexible but none make old VHS tapes look as good. Recommended, but be aware of some of its shortcomings, esp if you own a Mac or a 9-pin firewire device."
1,Solving a mystery Green Acres Style.,"Maybe I'm missing something here. This is my first book in this popular mystery series and I just don't get it. All the characters represent some type of Southern stereotype, the detective work is haphazard at best, and the ending is reminiscent of something out of the Dukes of Hazzard, where everything just happens to fall into place. Wow! This was the third book book in the series, if they are all like this I am amazed it has continued."
4,"Okay, I had mixed feelings....","I live in the Ozarks myself (albeit a ways north of the border from Ms. Hess), so I can vouch for the fact that yes, people like the inhabitants of Maggody, Arkansas, do really exist. But it was a bit painful to see so many of them concentrated in one spot. Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but I hope Hess wasn't going for total realism in this book. (But if I have to wonder, I suppose it's a moot point.)So, some of it was just a tad too far over the top to be comfortable. But the puzzle was done well, and I did enjoy it a great deal, in spite of myself."
3,It's okay.,I don't know how long it's supposed to take to work but I've been using it for two weeks. My problem area is right around my mouth along the path of hair follicles. I still breakout there regularly even though I've been using Clean and Clear. The only difference is they are not as large and as red as they were. I'm going to give it a few more weeks and if I don't see more improvement I'm going to stop using it.
2,Ehh,"This product seemed to be working at first, it does really dry out the blemishes..however into the second week of use I noticed my face breaking out heavily..a lot more than ever before on any other product and I have tried everything from Proactive, to Natural Soaps and Products, the dermatologist, Acne Free, The Body Shop's line for acne, and nothing has worked so I was willing to try anything but this was unsuccessful. I stopped using this immediately after I got the major breakout and threw it in the trash. I am not saying it doesn't work for some people but it did not work for me. I have fair and semi-sensitive skin and if you do to you might want to reconsider before trying this product."
4,Excellent product,"I have been using this product consistantly for two years. I have oily skin and medium skin tone. This product works great for me even during my PMS. I am a keloid; scare easliy, and it does help to reduce the marks. I think it would work a lot better if I didn't wear my hair on my face (the sides). The first week I used it I noticed remarkable clearing of my skin. This product would probably be a bit much for those with sensitive skin. I purchase a small scubbing pad from CVS with this product."
3,Its nice. Kinda...,"Well I got all of the acne treatments, I didnt get the box though. I kinda wanted the box to go with my acne treatments. Also, it could be just me but the product might be a little old. But hopefully my mild ance might clear up soon. Wish me luck! :)"
3,ehh its ok not great,I bought this as a last resort my skin over the past month has been freaking out and i got a bunch of huge zits everywhere. I picked this up and have been using it as directed (2 times a day) so far it has cleared up those little bumps i had on my forehead but the ones i got the kit for hasnt really improved. I have even had 2 pop up i dont know if its from the kit or not. I will continue to use it but i will prolly not buy this kit again. My face hasnt really made my skin worse but it hasnt made a huge difference either.
1,Pimples or Red Hot Rash- take your pick,I bought this for my daughter and at first it was great. Her face had broken out really bad and it one day it cleared up 50% better by the 3day it was barely noticeable. Then one night we started noticing bumps on her face. We just thought it was because she put make up on that day so she washed her face off. Well the next day her faces was covered in bumps and red and puffy. Not to mention it was itching and she felt like her face was on fire. She even got sick. Not sure if it was from her red inflamed face but DONT try it. She has NEVER broke out from anything until now!! So dont think it wont happen to you because you have not had allergic reactions to anything. Well think again......Dont waste your money. Unless you like having rash on your face instead of pimples!!!
1,"Wow, gotta love that chemical burn!","Unfortunately I am unable to give this product 0 stars. Maybe this product is only for people with severe acne. I didn't see a distinction on the box so I thought I would try it as a cleanser for occasional breakouts. I used all three products one night. That night my skin felt amazing! It was soft and smooth and felt clean. The next morning I woke up with a bit of irritation above my lip (below my nose). I figured I was just getting used to a new product and decided not to use it that night. The next day, I woke up with what I can only assume is chemical burn all over my face! This is from using the product once, two days prior! I will deal with the occasional zit and spare myself the lovely shade of red I've become. I'm hoping it goes away soon. Spare yourself the horror and just throw your money directly in the garbage."
4,works well,"I used to get a few breakouts every so often, but recently I started getting really bad ones that didnt seem to go away. This product cleared up my skin within 1-2 weeks. I noticed improvement every day. I like the cleanser because it left my skin feeling really refreshed. The lotion is a great alternative to other systems like Proactive which use a liquid toner as the second step. Finally, the spot treatment worked well but stung a little on my sensitive skin. This is why I did not give the product 5 stars. Def. give it a try though !"
3,Benefiber,So glad to find it on line. Cannot find it in local stores. It was very expensive but worth the price. Double the price that I did pay in store. It is a good product and it works.
5,CANNOT FIND THIS ANYWHERE!,"I have so much pain & bloating without Benefiber--I have tried the ""Equate"" brand which causes me to feel even more bloated and worse than before I took it!However, I started taking Benefiber and as soon as I started feeling like normal again, (I havn't felt normal in years!)I cannot find this anywhere! If you do happen to find it, they want a ridiculous price for it (because the Vendor knows there is a shortage of it)Honestly, who on earth could pay $100 for a 16.7oz container of it!!!I hope the manufacturer gets started and works double shifts to process this stuff--or, unfortunately I will have to go back to feeling pressure, pain & bloating on a regular basis :( which SUX!!!"
3,eh,"Im not ""regualar"" didnt really see a difference. Plain ol fiber cereal and outmil helped wonder compared to this...thought id give it a try..."
2,No evidence it does anything,"I stopped taking it for a while and did not notice any change.I stop taking Metamucil and I noticed the change in one day.Thats because Metamucil is real fiber.This one maybe good for something but if you want to use it for colon motility, it does nothing.The fiber must be non-dissolving for that.Convenience and ease of use yes, but efficacy - who knows.The company puts out no research and no evidence that it does anything at all.If [...] seems too good to be true, it ...."
2,Deceptive packaging is a turnoff,"Competing brands of similar products contain at least 50% more product in a similarly-sized container. The disclaimer on the package tells the consumer that the product is sold by weight and not volume and that some settling may occur in shipping and handling (really? It's a powder, people. How much ""settling"" can there be?) This tells me that they have probably had complaints about this in the past and their legal department created the disclaimer. Either that or they knew it was deceptive from the beginning. I can just picture some marketing genius telling management that by making the container larger, but putting less product inside, they will increase their shelf footprint and visibility, and minimize their product cost while betting that the American consumer is too stupid to notice that the unit cost per oz. is way higher than competitors. Personally, I resent the insult to our intelligence and refuse to buy this product. Tired of weaseling corporations."
2,Really gross,"I've used regular Benefiber for a few years and really like it. I thought I'd try this and that was a mistake. The orange flavor is so strong that I can't even finish the glass without wanting to gag. I gave it two stars becauseit does what it's supposed to do, it just tastes gross. This is getting dumped and I'm going back to the regular one."
4,good powder fiber,The product is in white powder form. The bottle received is big and it contained 125 portions which is good value for money. I used it by adding to juice and it did not have a bad taste. In fact you would not believe it is fiber.The effect is good as it gave regularity even by just taking one teaspoon a day.
5,Does exactly what it is supposed to,"Nothing sexy about this product - but it does add fiber to the diet and is completely tasteless. Just add it to coffee or juice and, voila!! One bottle of this stuff lasts longer than one would think. Definitely worth the price to keep the fiber intake up!All the best,Jay"
2,not what i thought it would be,"It says it makes you full longer where you don't have to eat that much. not so. I don't feel anything but i'm still taking it because it's fiber, but i'll see."
1,Not a good product,"This product is not as advertised... It does not dilute (become clear) in water. It does have a taste. It does not work nearly as well as the others on the market.I had to give it one star in order to post the review, but suffice it to say, I would have given zero if possible."
1,Not for Celiacs!,"I have Celiac Disease, so was naturally sceptical when I saw the ingredient is ""wheat dextrin"", under that on the label states""gluten free, less than 10ppm"". The Fda says 5ppm is considered GF. I loved the convenience of putting it in coffee in the AM. However part of my disease includes osteo arthritis. Out of desperation I stopped the Benefiber a seek ago & my pain has improved by 50%. I will not try it again."
3,Not as useful as I had hoped,"I bought this product for my father. He has a colon condition which requires him to have runny stools ongoingly. A nurse from a recent hospital visit suggested this equipment, ultimately gave it to us as long as we purchased the bags to go with it. The Amazon pricing was better than the manufacturer so I'm glad Amazon sells this product.Now for whether it works or not....It works fairly well if the person has very watery and loose stools. You can change bags after 10 days of use. If stools are forming or solid in any way, it wont work because the hole in the device is not large enough for the contents to slide through. Even with the loose stool, it wont capture everything but it may help."
3,I can't believe the price!,"I cannot believe what Amazon is selling this product for. In the real world it costs almost 300 in NHS hospitals.. without rep discount! And even then, it's daylight robbery. Who on earth is buying a flexiseal from Amazon, and Amazon, why are you selling it? Outrageous!"
1,Adopting actions listed in this book would be a nightmare,"I purchased this book primarily on the positive ratings. Anyone who has spent time actually developing new products would see that this book is a recipe for gridlock, stonewalling and endless corporate posturing in any American company. The author's assertion on the widespread adoption of his Star Gate process is also dubious. It appears this book was written by consultants for other consultants. Product, marketing and brand managers should avoid.If you want a book on how to develop products I would suggest the Fast Forward MBA in Project Management. While not specific to product development, it gives you the background and tools for more effectively manage big projects (e.g. product development)."
4,New product development summarised for general management.,"Cooper's previous books have covered different aspects of the demanding task of managing the development and introduction of new industrial products. We heard he was preparing a slim volume suitable for high level general managers, and this is it. Cooper's writing ability guarantees an absorbing read, and his vast amount of practical experience in companies guarantees that you learn how to make the advice really work. My only criticism is that this book needs to be slimmer still for a generalist audience, though it does have key-point boxes running through."
3,Technical perspective of product development process,Excellent text book style on the product development process. First part of the book is a bit dry and technical but does its job of highlighting the necessities of succesful product development and management.Later in the book the principles are applied in more real examples that are easier to comprehend.Overall a very good book for Product Managers new to the task or looking to refocus their energy. There are other books just as good and a bit less technical so don't end your reading with this book.
3,These are OK for recipes...,"...not so good for eating out of hand. They're a bit shrivelled and dry. The best thing we did with these was spread them on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and pour melted DARK chocolate over them. Cool in fridge, break apart and enjoy! Mmmmmmmmm.....Otherwise, I suggest putting them in cookies, quickbreads, or any recipe where they will get reconstituted a bit.If you want them just to eat (say, in trail mix) I much prefer Stoneridge Orchards Dried Montmorency Cherries."
4,Hilarious and weird,"This movie was way better, way funnier, and way weirder than I was expecting. I can't believe it was made for $6,000."
2,Insidepulse Movies - Mike Noyes,"The way Blood Junkie starts is one of great promise. It captures the look of old '80s horror films very well and even manages to get the pace right, which most modern slasher flicks miss out on. However, despite these two key ingredients, Junkie fails to provide a satisfying meal...Read my full review here:[...]"
2,Works OK but not worth the price,"I've had both a 525 and a 535e They are pretty rugged and have a good sized screen but the internal GPS is fair at best. The navigation software is not very good. Paired with all of the dropped GPS signals I can't recommend it. I recently bought a Sprint smartphone that uses windows mobile, after phone company discounts and rebates cost half as much as the Pharos. The navigation software is far superior and the GPS pulls in signal much better. I've run both devices side by side and Pharos loses satellite far more often."
4,Great Buy Price Wise just don't expect it to work in Manhattan NY,"I just bought this unit 3 days ago. Was originally thinking of buying a new Dell Axim with the GPS CF Card but when I saw the price + all the features this unit was offering ""I had to have it!"" I'm a computer consultant in NY City and am not too familiar with the area and thought this would be awesome because of my 99% lost rate, but unfortunately, in NY City, it has never achieved a GPS Lock, ever. I even downloaded their Jump Start app that is suppose to give the GPS on the unit a lil kick in the arse to help it achieve a lock but it doesn't work. So if your Manhattan bound, better just program your route ahead of time and manually use the mapping portion because the GPS is useless there.Also, the web sites advertise FREE Scype calls. Unfortunately the web sites are wrong and it's not part of the package so you still have to pay 2 cents a minute to call land lines from the unit over wireless."
4,The Three Musketeers MOVIE SERIAL ! JOHN WAYNE,"THE STATEMENT IS NOT TRUE, THAT IS WHERE THE 4TH SERIAL ENDED AND PREVIEWS FOR OTHER DVD'S BEGIN. THAT IS WHAT SERIALS/CLIFF HANGERS ARE... THEY CONTINUE....FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW, YEARS AND YEARS AND MANY MOONS AGO, SERIALS WERE PLAYED IN MOVIE THEATERS, PREVIOUS TO THE DAYS OF TV, THEY CONTINUED WEEK TO WEEK, SIMILAR TO THE SOAPS OF TV TODAY. GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO LOOK FOR A'The Three Musketeers Volume #2'FOR THE CONTINUATION.""JOIN US NEXT WEEK FOR THE CONTINUING ADVENTURES OF....""EPISODES ON DVD1. THE FIERY CIRCLE2. ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE3. THE MASTER SPY4. PIRATES OF THE DESERTENGLISH/FULL FRAME BLACK & WHITE/SCENE SELECTION/INTERACTIVE MENUS/PREVIEWS2004 DIGIVIEW DVD IN THIN BLACK PLASTIC CASECOMPATIBLE WITH ALL DVD PLAYERS"
2,Early Wayne Serial,This 1933 film stars John Wayne as a pilot aiding the French fighting the Arabs in North Africa. To me this film is not a winner. The ONLY viewers who might enjoy this film are died-in-the-wool John Wayne fans.
3,Youthful John Wayne!,Decent video quality considering age of the TV series. Good to see John Wayne at the beginning of his career. Interesting adaptation of Dumas' novel.
2,three musketeers,"This disk only contains four parts of a twelve part story, this is not detailed anywhere.Approxiamately half of part 3 is also missing."
2,This DVD does not include the ending,"This particular DVD by ""Digiview Productions"" does not include the end to the story of ""The Three Musketeers."" I guess I will have to buy another DVD to find out what happens to them. There is no indication on the DVD that it does not include the ending - so be fore warned! At first I thought something was wrong with my DVD, but after reading the other reviews here, I realized that it was only intended to include the first 4 of 12 chapters. These first 4 were entertaining and well done considering the era (1933)."
3,John Wayne in The Three Musketeers,"For anyone that is a true fan in John Wayne, (this is a series that I didn't know about) this goes back to when Wayne first got into short films. The audible portion of course is not the best, and it was shot with prehistoric equipment. But if you are interested in Waynes history, this is a must see."
1,"OK, but...",The Marengo version cuts off the credits at the beginningof each chapter after Chapter 1 and freeze-frames the chaptertitle card.
3,3 musketteers,"The movie was good, like watching an old movie. But it just ended in the middle of a scene, went to some sort of a commerical and that was it. I looked at the menu scenes and it only had 4 chapters. The dvd just left you hanging until you can get the rest of that movie. Very disappointed!"
1,Film quality is poor.,"I bought this DVD as a gift to my boyfriend who is a huge JW fan. We watched it together and both were very disappointed in it. The DVD seems to be in fast motion and then it goes to normal mode, then back to fast, then normal. Towards the last chapters on the DVD, there is no sound whatsoever. I don't know if the original movie was so old that converting it was too difficult, but if that was the case, then why bother. Wouldn't recommend at all."
2,"Great music and graphics, everything else no good.","My sister got this game when she was a kid, she never made it past the second level. I gave a crack at it and made it a little further. This game has a Very high difficulty after the first level. The Music and graphics however are quite good. I only suggest this game to hardened gamers that are lion king fans."
4,Good buy,"Had a few issues getting it to play, but that can be expected from a game this old. Otherwise, it works and was delivered in a timely manner."
2,DULL + BORING = BAD 4 OUT OF 10,"I guess the people who like this game are kids, because this game was seriously not fun and was a boring stale platformer. There is really no fun to be pulled out of this mess and is basically devoid of clear objectives, interesting challenges, good gameplay, or a noticeable storyline. The graphics and character designs look great along with the environments along with some enemy designs. Unfortunately, all I found myself doing was collecting health, killing wierd and stupid enemies, and wondering what the hell I was supposed to be doing in this stupid game because apparently the developer did not make your objectives clear by some decision or another. So you'll find yourself wandering a lot and trying to do a task all over again. This game is simply a chore and a nightmare to play. If you want to buy a good licensed game on a Disney movie, go buy the far better Aladdin game for SNES or Genesis."
5,Comprehensive with a very practical approach!,"This book gives a very good insight into the world of credit derivatives. The main products are decribed from a trading as well as from a pricing point of view. The software that comes with it, demonstrates various pricing methods as well as problems and deficits, these modells have.A must read for everybody who wants to get an insight into the world of credit derivatives.Well done!"
2,A Dull Read,"You have to be a Brit to appreciate this author's style of writing. She appears to be much more interested in style over substance. I bought the book because it appeared to be a very interesting subject, but the way it is presented puts the author's opinions and prejudices as being more important than the subject matter."
2,Not that impressed,"I know this has been around a long while and is considered something of a classic, but it just didn't do much for me. A lot of prose, a lot of fundamentals, chapters 77 to 82 are commercials for Norman's newsletter service. Seems to fail to recommend any specific action other than subscribing to his newsletter. There are some interesting, though out of date tables. 101+ subjects that just don't seem to come together."
3,"Great story, mediocre delivery","The story of Frances E. Tywoniak is a very interesting and inspiring one, yet the writing of the book fails to meet the level of the story behind it. The writing in mediocre but I still believe Tywoniak's story is one that should be read."
2,Painful reading,"At several points throughout Migrant Daughter, I found myself asking aloud, 'Was this book even edited?' The writing is unsophisticated to say the least. Choppy sentences, incoherrent recollections, unnecessary tangents, and childish descriptions fill the pages of this never-ending autobiography. The poor writing even makes this book somewhat uninteresting. If you appreciate quality of writing at all, do not read Migrant Daughter. This book was required reading for a course in American autobiography and I questioned the professor's decision to include this."
4,Compelling train-car confrontations,"Anyone who has ever thought about what would happen if a train and car collided will be rewarded by the compelling train-car confrontations in FAST TRACK. In addition, John DeDakis is an experienced journalist and shares his knowledge of the art as fledgling journalist Lark learns her trade. He has good lessons to share on interviewing techniques and journalistic integrity."
5,You'll read nonstop,"Don't start until you have time to read straight through. A fascinating mystery even more special if you are familiar with Madison , WI and the surrounding area. I'm waiting for number two."
5,LOVED IT,The book is fun - like many other reviewers I rarely read/enjoy who-dun-it thrillers - this was an exception - read it! As a first novel it's great - only thing I would change is the commentary one one character's wardrobe - rest is great - read it all in one sitting! Am looking forward to the next one and I CAN'T WAIT for the movie!
4,Fast Track: A Fast Read,"""Fast Track"" is probably not a book I would have picked up off the shelf had I seen it in a library or bookstore; mystery novels are not really my cup of tea. But I thoroughly enjoyed this one! It was incredibly relatable and engaging. DeDakis strikes a comfortable balance between his journalistic background and creative fiction, although sometimes I felt as if Lark was telling me every emotion she was experiencing, rather than allowing me to figure these out through her actions. The ending was refreshing, because I was half expecting her to end up married to the reporter (gag). It certainly has movie potential and I'm anxious to read through the next installment. Overall, nicely done!"
4,Thoroughly Enjoyed Fast Track,"I was at the book store looking for the lastest Patterson book then I met Mr. DeDakis. I ended up buying Fast Track instead and I can say I was very pleased with the choice. The story unfolded very naturally - nothing hurried or forced. Johnny D. kept the story flowing nicely, with just enough suspense for me to spend my entire afternoon reading just to find out how the story ended. Very nice book - I'll be watching for future titles by this up and coming author."
4,Review from a non-mystery fan,"I enjoyed this book despite the fact that I'm not an avid mystery reader. Throughout, I suspected everyone from Father Dan to the Mayor to Roy Miller to, I think, the Stones at one point! It's nice to have so many suspects - keeps the reader guessing. I especially enjoy ""watching"" relationships develop (as well as the emotional development of the protagonist) in the books I read and this book gave me that, all under the guise of a mystery."
4,Fast Track to a good read!,"If you are looking for suspense, drama, mystery, a good book that you simply can't put down... this is it! It kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page. John Dedakis is a skilled writer and I look forward to reading more of his work!"
5,Fast Track read by choice,"I had heard a review about Fast Track and it stirredmy curiousity. I wasn't disappointed. The story linewas one that kept me turning pages quickly. If therewas a negitive, its that I didn't want to put it downuntil the story was finished. I gave Fast Track a 5 STARand hope all those that read this review will also readthis book."
5,"""Fast Track"" is a winner!","In his debut novel, John DeDakis develops the ""Lark Chadwick"" character into one that is destined to have a long, adventurous life in literature. The story takes unexpected twists and turns, and all the characters are intriguing, yet believable. I tore through this book, excited to find out what would happen next. I'm downloading ""Bluff"" now, and hoping John writes quickly, so we'll have more Lark stories soon! :-)"
4,Smart Summer Reading,"John DeDakis's Fast Track is a smart ""whodunnit"" that starts quickly and clips along. It's a murder mystery relying more on plot and relationships than theatrics and gore. The use of first-person perspective is an interesting approach that allows the reader to feel more connected to the characters than a detached third-person would. Fast Track uses suspense, place, and time to develop this story. I recommend adding Fast Track to this summer's reading list."
3,"WARNING: Be sure you get the volume with 65 songs,","Although most of the songs on this CD are worth the purchase price, and great memories, the version I received only has 59 songs, not the 65 listed on Amazon.comFor the record the missing ""Tunes"" (Bar code 6 10535-68032 7) are, Stingray, Thunderbirds,Chico and the Man, Tom Jones Show, (Its not unusual) and Happening 68. Not enough to return it, but certainly somthing you should know.I had purchased the CD for such themes as Emergency, High Chaparral, Night Gallery and Felony squad. I cannot tell after the all the years if these are originals or copies, but they are good enough to bring back memories.If you are purchasing the CD for liner notes which tell you about the music, forget it. It does list artist for some, Author for some, but the scant notes are a one paragraph note about the show. A bit dissapointing."
3,The CD is ok,"There are some ok themes on this CD some of the themes I have heard on TVland or Nick At Nite but I would say the majority of the themes on the Cd are ones I have never heard so this is not my favorite in the Television's Greatest Hits collection, but I guess I should just stick with the Television's Greatest Hits CD's that have themes of shows that I actually grew up watching or saw on TVland or Nick at Nite."
4,"Strong Episodes, but Short","This short, first volume of collected Twilight Zone episodes features two strong episodes and a timid, undeveloped one. ""The Invaders,"" with almost no dialogue, is an achievement in suspense with an amazing ending. ""Nothing in the Dark,"" featuring Robert Redford, encounters deep questions (and fears) about death. The first episode, ""Night of the Meek,"" with Art Carney as Santa Claus, had some potential as a good story, but lacked any serious conflict or drama. While ""Invaders"" and ""Nothing in the Dark"" are well worth the cost of this CD, there are better volumes in Collection One from which to choose."
3,Only 3 Episodes?,"I love the Twilight Zone Series and have nearly every episode (about 150) on video tape. However, it seems silly that if you want to own the entire series on DVD you would need to buy 43 different volumes. Other TV series conveniently sell theirs by the season. The Sopranos sells about 15 hrs of footage per season in 1 box (with multiple DVDs). I find that method more convenient and it saves a ton of space on a book (or DVD) shelf."
1,wasted my money,"I bought this one after reading some reviews here, and I am regretting it after I was able to watch it. All the episodes were terrble. It made me blush, because it was really that bad.I think I wasted my money on this one."
5,This is the tightest compalation ever,I think that this is one of the best compalation albums ever to come out from the city by the bay
1,too dry!,"this condom was cheap, did not break ever yet, yes it is thin, but very dry! we had to buy lubricate for it to slip right in ;) dryness was the only problem"
1,El Piratero # 1,"I bought 4 CDs here from this same seller and discovered all his Lucia Mendez CDs he sells are recorded from an old record with very terrible sound. If you are planning in purchasing this CD-R or any of Lucia Mendez CD-R that he has for sell in his store you just got ripped off, beware he has another store with a different ID name too."
3,Very Salty tale,The young hero of this 1st volume of a trilogy has advanced consumption. I cannot see how he will survive a trilogy. He decides to go sea for the invigorating air. This is a twist from the usual swashbuckler where the hero is a robustious periwig.It works because of the author's nautical and historical acumen. The male La Traviata coughing up his lungs is overstated and a little inconsistent with life on a 19th century sailing steamer..
4,Good collection by a master of wit,"Huck Finn, I could take or leave. Conn Yankee is among my favorit e classics. Joan of Arc---better than other interpretations ofwarrior women. I recommend this collection and ""Damsel in the Rough"" by Ann M. Tempesta."
5,Great as a gift or for yourself,I've been using Dove products for years and am happy with them. This set is great as a gift or if you want to try out the various products included yourself. The bag is great for traveling or storing future purchases. I use Dove soap all the time and find it does not dry out my skin like other soaps - especially in winter. Highly recommended.
2,so-so,"Not the minty fresh kind I was hoping for, wish they made a better one or liquid type. Also left a film on skin."
2,Not what I expected,"This product was not what I expected, it was alot smaller and rough and it did make my skin feel smoothe the way as expected. I expected alot more considering that it was imported from France."
1,quality,"I have been using Pre de Provence soaps for a while. I ordered this online from Dudur because the shop in my area discontinued the product. Unfortunately, the soap i received through Dudur is not the same quality as the ones i used to buy. The size of the soap is much smaller and it does not have the rose petal/or grains. Additionally, the scent of the soap is missing.... I don't recommend buying this soap from Dudur."
2,Not recommended reading,"I was extremely disappointed with this work. It was amateurishly written and the dialog left much to be desired. The language usage appeared too modern for the time period. The plot line was simply unbelievable, even for a ghost story. Much of it left me rolling my eyes."
5,beautiful illustrations; thoughtful warm story for any age,"My 8 year old and I read it together and it was a moving experience for both of us. She is reading chapter books now and we both miss the kind of picture book stories that we had enjoyed so much. At any age, it's nice to sit down with a good story. The combination of the gorgeous illustrations and the thoughts about family and devotion in this story was magic.As a bonus, Mercer Mayer talks about his childhood growing up in Honolulu, Hawaii and how he learned about race and ""melting pots"" as a child. Congratulations on a wonderful book, Mr. Mayer!Get the book and read it with a child."
4,loooooong story,"This looked like a beautiful book but it didn't keep my 4 year old daughter's interest. I could barely stay awake through it. The story is good and I like the illustrations but, unlike with some dramatic tales of adventure, my interest slowly waned with each twist and turn of the plot. I understand Mercer Mayer took a hiatus from writing children's books -- I'm glad he's back and look forward to his next one. But I wouldn't buy this book."
5,Empowering Sounds for a Deeper Meditation Experience,"While most yoga music contains popular New Age melodies and soft, light-hearted, almost fabricated attempts, this is a real winner. I am an instructor of Qi Gong at Furman University and use this in my more advanced classes. The most powerful aspect, perhaps, lies in the depth of the music and in its resonating power. I highly recommend you try it out as well for yourself."
2,A Waste of Time,"The story could have been interesting, but the screenplay was terrible and unrealistic. It was cheesy from the very beginning but I continued to watch, hoping the ending would be good enough to save the film. It did not and was a total disappointment."
1,Pointless,"This could have been a good movie, but they wasted time on poor actors, the only good scene was when jades mom passed. I too was hoping the ending would save the movie but it was to far gone. very disappointed"
4,Good price for a good product,"These flags are pretty much the same flag, variying in colors and prices according to the seller. Because they all wear out due to the wind and rain, I found these flags were offered at a good price, arrived quickly and well packaged. I will order from this seller again when I need more."
5,Fantastic,"My son who is 2nd grade loved it and ate it up. After reading the book together, he and I played rhyming games just as the book was written about Shakespeare in rhymes! The pictures drawn by the author's students were also nicely done and appealed to him as well. Five stars without hesitation. Great way to introduce Shakespeare to children."
3,Delta faucet,It is a nice faucet and definitely worth the money I paid on Amazon. It is nearly $200 more in Expo. The included soap dispenser is convenient but does not sit perfect on the counter like the faucet does. All in all I would definitely recommend it.
2,not that good,"I bought this book, because I want to make my own video. However, the book I got was a 2nd edition, which most things is the book were too old for nowadays. some basic things are ok, but technology parts like devices and programs are just too old"
5,A 'must have' for those new to digital video,"If you're thinking about buying your first digital video camcorder or up-grading, or you're want to learn how to edit video using your computer then this is a great book. The author does a great job explaining technical things that go along with digital camcorders and making movies. You really need to understand how digital video works in order to be able to make terrific movies and how to work with your camcorder and computer software. Even though this is a 4th edition (2006) it has some information about Blue-Ray and lots about High Definition (HD) which is a big step up from analog video and standard difinition video. After you read this book, and apply many of the techniques, you'll be able to make much better videos than before."
2,Okay for the money,"Ordered these after ordering a pair of similar sized from smile river. These had much better color, a darker green that is fairly well represented in the picture. The clarity was poor (I don't expect diamond like clarity), so they really didn't sparkle. I'm guessing these could have benefited from a treatment of some sort. As Emeralds are in huge demand now, getting a good quality stone is very expensive. I talked to a guy at Halzberg Diamonds, and a set of 1/4 ct AAA stones was $1500+."
3,action with alien movie,I know a lot of people do not like this movie but I do.I personally like it better then the sequel.I guess I enjoyed the country side thrill ride rather then watching them chase an alien inside of a large container the whole time in Interceptor Force 2.
2,Landscape Design,"This is one of the most tedious books that I've ever read. It focuses more on historical, cultural and politcal influences than actual garden design. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you're in need of a good night's sleep."
5,I love that my picture is in there,I live in this town and I liked how you put it together. You can't even get this book in the store anymore.
4,Great Story-Great Storyteller,"Susan Parker's memoir of her husband, Ralph's accident and it's aftermath is the best thing I've read this year. It's funny, sad, shocking, and completly compelling. This is a book I couldn't put down and continue to think about. I want to know more about these people!"
5,Captivating.,"I was totally captivated by this book, which will stay with me. Susan's Parker life was turned upside down when her husband had a bad accident which paralyzed him from the shoulders down. This book is vignettes of her life since. Her writing reminds me of funny adventure travel writers like Tim Cahill, Pico Iyer, Bill Bryson and Doug Lansky. Her journey is not to a foreign land, but might as well be. Her description of how she built and found a new life is captivating, funny and moving."
2,I read this book some time ago,I really love the genre memoir when it catches me and absorbs me. This book was fair to begin with and fair at the end. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
4,Unbox is Amateur,"Who the heck is ""Red"" Serling? Everybody knows it's ROd Serling. Unbox' error is not just a typo either, because it is repeated in several places. C'mon, Unbox! Don't insult classical TV like that!"
4,Three Strong - One Weak,"Another great addition to anyone's TZ collection. Three of the episodes are compelling, one lacks a little. This is a great opportunity to see Bronson in an early work that actually shows off his talent. Again, Klugman shows the uniqueness of his skills as well. This disc will not disappoint. Recommended."
1,BAH,"Bad copy, repeats of the same short in a couple of the dvd's. Never ordered any more Twilight Zone dvd's after this one was so bad."
3,Twilight Zone Vol. 4,Mr Dingle the Strong-Great episode! But in my opinion is the second best episode on this disc. Still every episode of Twilight Zone with Bergess Meredith is a good one. Two-Has always been one of my favorites. Stars Elizabeth Montgomery & Charles Bronson. These two episodes make the DVD worth buying. The other two episodes are good but not the best.
5,music,"i love weird,scary, and hauntly beautiful music, and any thing made by the dark santuary group is that type of music. i type in that type of music and that group came up and i was not disappointed. their music is great. their music lets all your emotions come out"
2,Booooring,"I was required to buy this book for my class. It is utterly boring. If I had trouble going to sleep, I just read this book. Some of the information is outdated (e.g. how the chicken pox vaccine should be given), as it's copyright is 2005, and the subject matter it contains on the health, safety and nutrition of the young child is constantly changing. The publisher needs to create a 7th edition and use different authors."
1,Never Received The Book,Amazon had to reimburse my payment because one of the sellers calu never sent the order. I waited a month for a book that never came. I would never buy from calu again and you shouldn't either. This seller was very inconsiderate and never responded to any of my emails.
3,A Faustian bargain.,"Simon is a fairly outspoken man. He has problems holding onto a job. He is in a relationship with Carl, gay, with a very real fear of getting AIDS. After much delay he is tested & finds he is HIV positive. In his anger, he writes letters to Satan for help. Sure enough the devil appears & agrees to make him HIV negative again. But Simon must perform several task. Would the devil try to trick or deceive you? Of course he would. He's the devil. Simon's first tasks is to become a gay bashing comedian delivering jokes written by the devil to overflow homophobic crowds. He becomes wildly sucessful, a national sensation. He marries his best friend, Muse, to complete his cover. Of course, that works out badly. He denies Carl who by now has full blown AIDS & turns his back on everything & everyone he once loved & cherished. Then things get really bad. Pretty dark but an interesting movie nontheless."
5,Cutting edge hydration system at a great price,"Sure, these things seem overpriced for what they are -- a plastic bag that holds water -- but, up in the mountains on a bike, that water can be a seriously critical difference and the price isn't an issue. That said, this was the best price I found anywhere for the new-version 100-oz size. If it ever fails, and I survive, I'll let you know in a loud voice."
4,Doesn't include the lock valve,"i bought the 100 oz since my camelbak pack came with the 75oz and sometimes i just need more space for water. The reservoir feels better than the one in my backpack. The only bad thing is that it doesn't come with the lock valve, instead it just has a straight one that will make it splash everywhere if you accidentally press it. I had to buy it separately."
4,The best so far...,"This Camelback Omega Hydro-Titanium Replacement by the is the best that I've used so far. The only problem I had with it, after about six months of use, was a small leak near the rim of the filler hole."
4,Camelbak Omega Resevoir,Great product! The only thing that I noticed is that it does have a slight plastic taste. I hope that it will go away.
1,not what was ordered,ordered 50 oz reservoir and received 32 ounce one instead. box says 50 but the size is smaller and says 32 ounce on it.
4,camelbak,"IMHO, a good buy for a Camelbak, easy drinking and cleaning capability..........good price for what you get............"
1,wrong size,"amazon mailed me the wrong size. I ordered 50 oz and they sent me the 35 oz. The amazon.com customer service rep told me to call Camelbak directly, like they are the ones that mailed me the wrong size, so this review is based on receiving wrong product, not reflection of Camelbak bladders in general which I love."
1,Amazon advertises one thing... something an entirely different shape arrives!,"Let me start off by saying the 1 star review has everything to do with Amazon.com and nothing to do with the product itself. But buyer be warned, if you THINK you are purchasing a Camelbak in the shape displayed, long top to bottom, you may be very surprised when a very short and wide Camelbak arrives instead. Amazon.com doesn't allow me to easily see the part number of the item I was ordering so I had to assume that what is displayed on the Amazon product page is what I would be receiving. That was NOT the case with my purchase. This one is going back and I'll buy it locally. This is the 3rd time purchased from Amazon this year where the actual item received differs wildly from what is advertised either in shape or color."
1,PO'ed!,Well I decided to order a camelback from here.I accidentally ordered the 45oz from plasma buddy but wanted the 72oz camelback from amazon. So i pretty much paid 15 and some change and I get $10 back. So i lost 5 dollars on which i could have used for the 72oz camel back. Thank You Plasma Buddy!!(NOT!!!)
4,"Overall good, but caveat: Plastic Flavor","I climbed Mt Rainier with this hydration reservoir and wanted additional water storage without a lot of weight or frills, and this puppy fit the bill very well. It has proven to be very durable (even when I have dropped it and abused it on the mountain).So why ding it for 1 star? This particular model claims to have a pure water taste without any plastic flavor. I did not find that to bear out, as I could taste the plastic in the water. I soaked it a few days with a couple liters of water and a few tablespoons of lemon juice and that has resolved the plastic flavor.So -- great, inexpensive hydration bag. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. I just recommend taking care of the plastic flavor before you use it."
3,Disappointed,The tube is permantly fixed to the storage bag. A good camelbak has detachable tubing for easy replacement.
5,Camelback bladder,This is an excellent bladder. A larger opening and all kinds of new characteristics. An on off valve at the mouth piece is one of them that comes in handy. A great buy
1,Go another route,Purchased the 45oz and it was a nightmare. Bad plastic taste when i first got it. Cured this with some lemon juice but 2 days into my trip the horrible after taste was resurrected. Just as the taste was BACK i notice my BACK was wet. Took two days to tear a hole in this piece of trash. Stay away.........
4,Good list of shows that have memorable themes,"These shows may be a while before my time, but the themes are classics like the Brady Bunch, Merry Melodies, or Three Stooges. A lot of these themes reflected the mood of the show, and back then, there was a lot of quality and professionalism in the themes. If you grew up back then, you will probably remember many of these shows. My only problem is that a few of these themes do have poor recording quality, and some of the songs aren't originals, but its still a good collection, and many of these themes are hard to come by these days."
4,Its a Hit!,"If you are a product of the sixties- and grew up a tv junkie- then this is for you. Memories that may have slipped to the back of your brain will reappear after you listen to the themes from the 50s and 60s. My wife and I listened to it all the way through and it was like being a kid again. The Courtship of Eddie's Father was one of my favorites. Just hearing the theme song brought back episode after episode of memories and the fun I had as a child. Looney Tunes,I Spy,Pink Panther, The Green Hornet(Al Hirts' crazy trumpet!) plus many more. I would recommend this to anyone.The album art alone makes good wall art in an entertainment room. You can take these classic vinyls and convert them to MP3s to enjoy even when you are away from home. ENJOY!"
3,generally poor quality and (of course) very short tunes,"This CD has four types of TV themes: early morning cartoons, mid-morning sitcoms, afternoon adventure, and prime time drama. Many of the tracks are either thin-sounding or poorly recorded, although they are original recordings (I think). My Favorite Martian and The Partridge Family themes sound like someone put a microphone up to an old TV set. The sequence flows very well, however. This volume and volume one are must-haves for classic-TV theme buffs; a ""tee vee toons trivia booklet"" is included."
3,Good!!,"I liked this CD, I have heard some of the themes before and others I hadn't but even the ones I hadn't heard before I enjoyed listening too, my favorite is the Road Runner theme even though I have never even watched it but I just think it is a cute theme, I used to listen to this CD a lot and played my favorite themes over and over again until I got tired of the CD, so I kind of overdosed on TV themes, now I only listen to it like once in a while instead of all the time but I don't listen to the whole CD just the themes I like and I skip the ones I don't like."
3,Title Cut from TV Show - The Virginian,I purchased the CD for one reason and that was to get an original sound track from the 1960's TV western - The Virginian. The song is an all-time favorite of mine.
5,Classic Chuck Norris!,What can one say but Chuck Norris Rules! I remember seeing this at the movies and I enjoyed it just as much now as I did then! Nothing was cooler than the airport scene! The Chuck Norris flying side kick! You'd better get this movie or Chuck will know!
4,good,very good excelent greatWONDERFUL a GOOD MOVIE excelent actor very good scenes excelent quality abcd efg hij klm opq n
2,Good Guys Wear Black,"A Special Forces unit gets sent into North Vietnam to rescue some POW's. The unit is setup but a few manage to escape the ambush and survive. Five years later the remaining survivors are targeted for termination one by one. Fortunately Chuck Norris (Major Booker) is warned by a pretty special investigator (Anne Archer) and the hunt is on for the mastermind behind everything. The plot is okay but if you're expecting a lot of martial arts you may be disappointed. Likewise, Chuck Norris provides his usual cardboard acting skills with some typical action scenes you would expect for this kind of film."
2,Don't let the trailer fool you!!!,"Like many of you, I saw the trailer and I thought that this was gonna be an low budget action-packed film of the 70's, BUT I GOT PULLED!What the trailer doesn't tell you is that there is only ONE action scene and it's only at the begining. The scene is at midnight and you don't get to see the action soo clearly, besides, Chuck Norris is not the one-man-army in that scene.The rest of the action scenes were SOOO SHORT!! You don't get excited enought! you think that the action is gonna go on, but NOOOT!! it QUICKLY stops to hear more blah,blah,blah!For Chuck Norris fans maybe this movie is worth watching it, but for those who want the ""Missing in Action"" style then search somewere else.Adios."
3,If you're a fan of Goldberg you'll want this video.,"This video doesn't show enough highlights, it also dosen't show very recent events that Goldberg has wrestled in."
4,Back when Bill was the one to watch!,"This is a retrospect of Goldberg's wrestling career when he was the ""in"" thing in the world of professional wrestling. Bill kept adding to his undefeated streak (we don't see his loss to Kevin Nash) and keeping the fans excited. Yes, this was a period during WCW's better days. Too bad thigs didn't work out at the front office or Goldberg and WCW would still be a serious threat to WWE today! Still, don't rule out Goldberg vs. Rock at some point in the future!"
5,Great!,This is a great video for Goldberg and WCW fans alike. It has an in depth interveiw with the man Bill Goldberg and shows some of his greatest matches including when he won the title from Hogan.
4,"If you smellll what the goldberg, is cookin.","I give the tape two thumbs up for originality and the fact that it recaps all of goldbergs matches uptodate in wcw. EAT your heart out wwf,your imitation stonecoldberg is no match if he was to get hoisted up in the jackhammer and speared through the mat with the most electrifying move since Hollywood hogans legdrop.If siskel and ebert were still around, they would give it 2 thumbs up!"
5,Golberg Rules4EVER!!!!!!,This tape is the best I've seen yet!It really shows what a great wrestler Goldberg is!I recommend any WCW fans to watch this tape!Goldberg forever!
4,Meet the future of WCW - Goldberg,"I would like to have given this 5 stars as I personally like the man, for his work with animal rights and his great sense of sportsmanship, which is badly lacking from pro wrestling in recent years. This shows the promise and the personality of this young guy, and some good matches from his very first to his beating of Hogan for the title. You see him use alot more than the jackhammer and spear. Too bad it was edited like most videos so you don't get the whole matches as they happened. It would have made a longer tape but let you enjoy the match in peace. Nothing was said of his friends, past in football, or the public service he has done. (which alot of the guys do, and would be nice to recognise them for) It was well put together though. Parents need not worry about foul language or bad role modelling here. The most riske thing on it was the Nitro Girls dancing at the end of the tape. (not with Goldberg :-))"
5,GOLDBERG'S THE MAN.,"For Goldberg Fan's across the entire world, you'll definitely love-this video. I love the man,as his spears and jackhammers through many of his easiest opponents, except K-Nash(Starrcade-1998). Overall,both Austin/Goldberg are both my Idols."
3,"Billy ""STONE COLD"" GOLDBERG","YO, this video is good except for the fact that Billy oldberg is not DA MAN. this video is a ripoff of stonecold because golbarg wrestled for about 2 years, and there is nothing else for him to accomplish. I would rather spend my $$$ and get a video of GILLBERG or BARRY HOROWITZ or the brooklyn brawler or tiger ali singh or Brad armstrong or lenny lane.The list goes on. WCW hyped galdberg and now that ERIK BITCHOFF is a greedy fool, his marketing stratagy went down the toilet bowl in selling tapes. WCW pay-per-views are weak. I would rather see a wcw saturday night jobber marathon. The good thing about the tape is gouldbergs 1st match, But they leave out when he was talking mess on the jay leno show. They should have avideo on FAT tony schivani drinking surge."
1,THIS SUCKED!!!!!,"I hated it all! I really hate Goldberg because he's all fake. If anything buy WWF Wrestle Mania boxed series because you'll get your money's worth! Simply, DON'T BUY THIS!"
3,Great looking -- once I painted it!,"If you want this, grab it while it's available from Amazon. I fell in love with it at first sight, but by the time I came to order it it was only available for full price from an outside vendor. Then it took 3 months to arrive. When I finally got it out of the box, there was no way in the world you could call it ""Gilded Copper"" -- rusted wroght iron was more like it -- it was BLACK. Luckily I had my trusty copper spray paint handy, and now it looks just the way I hoped it would -- the perfect steampunk finishing touch for my copper-themed kitchen. I would have given it 5 stars if I could have gotten it 1) at Amazon's price 2)on time and 3) in the advertized color."
4,very attractive pot rack,"Took advice from one of the reviews and got in on the great price of this pot rack. It was almost $80 higher most other places on Amazon. Yes, ours also came with almost black finish, but i have no problem hitting it with some copper spray paint to brighten it up.Great price, speedy deliver!"
2,company secretary's desktop guide,The book has virtually been rendered helpless by the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and i believe teh author should have waited for that law to be passed before writing.
4,OP is consistently comfortable,It's easy to buy OP t's and other apparel. They're consistently well made and colorful choices allow you to wear them with most anything.
3,"Cecil Graham , the cynical hero","Melodramatics from Lady Windermere. Mrs. Erlynne and Lord Windermere meeting but incomprehensibly deaf to the rumors about them. Yes, this is not Oscar Wilde's best play but, oh, the zingers he does get in, namely through Cecil Graham. Example: ""Well, there's nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman. It's a thing no married man knows anything about."" Read it for the pithy lines."
4,Enjoyable,This man is a true talent and such a joy to listen to. I would highly recommend this CD; enjoy.
4,I like it,"Trombone Shorty he is great up beat fun and exciting music makes you want to dance.Saw him at Sierra Brewery in Chico ca, hope he comes back soon!!!"
1,This pleasant short is just 10 minutes long,"I was shocked that this DVD was just 10 minutes long. And I see NO reference to its length in it's description. Amazon should put the length of the video in its Product Details. It does not. Pleasant little short, that might be nice on an iPod."
1,Do NOT buy this,"10 minutes??? I should have looked and read all the info. What a drag, wife and I are going to FLorence in January for work, thought I'd get a sense of it. Not with this videop."
5,Another 5 Stars for Leslie,"Thanks again Leslie.I liked Leslie West's music for years, but starting with PHAT it turned to love. PHAT was great, but Blues to Die For, Got Blooze, and now Blue Me are fantastic. It is just my kind of blues; slow and deep.Blue Me follows Leslie's last few entries; all covers. This is fine with me. No need to re-invent the wheel. Just do the greats as only the greatest can do them. Keep'em coming Leslie, keep'em coming.The samples do not do this CD justice."
2,"""11"" on the dial","Leslie West is a fine guitar player but this ""blues"" record is over the top in terms of guitar tone - consistently saturated (think Neil Young and Crazy Horse at their craziest or Tommy Iommi). It sounds like he took a Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier amp and turned everything to 11. I don't know about you, but I like a little nuance with my blues and that word is not in Leslie's vocabulary. When I listened to this, I thought how great it would be if he would make another Mountain record. Unfortunately, ""Never in My Life"" does not translate into the blues. Skip this release and get ""Leslie West Live!"", his 1993 record."
2,Low quality Image in a nice chassis,"I am not pleased with this purchase. The only nice thing I can say about this monitor is that; the fit and finish are super. Controls are great and the OSD is great. UI is intuitive effecient.My complaints are the backlight dims midscreen, there is a rippling shimmer at all resolutions/refresh, the overall brightness is lacking and color syncing to any other monitor is nearly impossible. Colors cannot be set to an accurate representation...period. If you have low expectations and just want an affordable widescreen this would be a good choice. If you need a bright monitor with accurate color display, I would recommend a pass."
2,There is a reason they don't make this anymore,"I bought this monitor on clearance, very excited about the great deal I got. What a disappointment. I didn't like, but accepted the refresh that froze up the screen every single time I exited a game or signed on. What really got me though was the annoying line that formed on the left side of the screen. It caused a discoloration with everything I did, and was very annoying. I would have to unplug the monitor for a couple minutes, then plug it back in to get rid of the line. A couple minutes later though, the line reappeared.I took the monitor back to the store and was told someone else had turned on back in for being faulty. They ordered me a new one, then told me a couple days later that it wasn't made anymore. By the time this is all done and the store orders me an equivilant product, I'll have been without a computer monitor for over a week all because of this lousy monitor.It seems like a good deal for the price, but stay away from Acer."
1,"Looked great, until it stopped working after 8 months","I liked this monitor - easy to set up, looked fantastic. Unfortunately, I woke up one morning and it wouldn't display anything. Looked online and found out this problem was all too common - the power supplies fail on Acer products. After having to return my kid's Thomas toys and my pet food, this is just another ""Made In China"" disaster for me."
2,"Good monitors, while they last.","I can't give these monitors more than 2 stars. I got them both at Staples and one lasted 1 year and the other lasted like 1.5 years. The image quality was good on them for the price, while they worked, but come on, build in some longevity."
4,Excellent Deal,"I am more than satisfied with the product. I am not using a DVI capable video card, so the lack of DVI doesn't bother me. You see many 17 inch non-widescreen lcds going for more. Once you go widescreen though, you can never go back. The only thing to be wary of is at the highest resolution (1440 x 900) you are limited to a 60 hz refresh rate. People with fast eyes may get annoyed at the scanlines that sometimes appear."
4,A great monitor !!,"I have had it for 6 months. Sharp picture. Love it !Of course, there are better LCD models on the market but you will have to pay at least $300.00"
1,Not worth it!!!,I purchased this book based on reading some reviews that said it had great photos. In my opinion the photos were not that great and the content was lackluster and limited. I have paged through other books and looked and websites and found better pictures of Japanese tattoos. I wish I had read a review like this so I could have saved myself some money...
5,Like new!,"I just want to say thanks, I was a little bit skeptical about how will be the condition of the book, and when I opened it was like a brand New! In a really good shape! this is a present for a friend who is a tattoo artist in Mexico and he wants something about Japanese tattoos, I believe he will be very happy to see this book. So once again Thanks a lot I am very happy with this purchase!"
2,nice images,"The book is nice but some of the photos are not that great in quality. Has some nice designs, but I have to say I expected a little more of this book. Would probably buy again though."
3,"Great Photos, Weak Text","If you have no experience with horimono, this book gives some excellent images focusing mostly on the works of three masters (only one, Horiyoshi III Sensei of Yokohama still actively tattoos). The book is worth buying for the images alone.And I wish it were the images alone. The captions are often naive, bordering at times on offensive. The author at best over-exotifies and at worse verges on ridiculing some of her subjects, and seems to know very little about the tradition, history, and mores of Japanese society and horimono. Add to that an introduction that is almost unexplainably ludicrous (by an author with no bio!) and you have a book that's great to look at, just not to read. I'd give it 5 stars if it was just the photos.Read Takahiro Kitamura's books as well as Donald Richie's for better information."
5,You never saw Polaroids like this!,"Imagine life-size Polaroid photographs. Imagine traditional, Japanese, full-body tattooing. Imagine a book of life-size Polaroids taken of traditional, full-body, Japanese tattoos.... this IS that book! Sandi Fellman got the proper introductions and a great toy (a Polaroid that really takes life-size plates) when she went to Japan and set out to document the hidden world of the irezumi, the tattoo underground. This collection is almost all traditional hand-executed tattooing. The details are unparallelled, and you get to see all kinds of shading you might not notice at a distance. This type of body modification still is a secret, private practice in Japan and to view images of this quality is rare."
2,low standard tattoos in a below average book,"How disappointed I was by this book. It contains absolutely no news. The tattoo masters in this book do not meet in any way the high standard of irezumi that I am used to. For all you buyers who really want to learn about Japanese tattoos, read the book by Richie and Buruma, very informative. For photo's who are less blurry than in this book, just check the net or invest many dollars more for a proper book. ... . This book is a nice introduction for some common knowledge about Japanese tattoo art, but does not provide any new insights or ideas."
1,Disappointed!,"I concur with the other people who were disappointed with this book. Images were very low quality, tattoos themselves were mediocre, and text only skims the surface of Japanese tattoo design and history. Not worthy of the price paid, or the coffee table."
2,Terrible writing and poor picture quality,"On the good side, Amazon service was just as great as ever in delivering this book.On the bad side (and there are several) this book had a cheap feel about it just from opening the packaging. Reading the preface / introduction I was stunned by the insulting gibberish by D.M. Thomas as to the Japanese tattoo culture. Looking at the back cover of the book you also see the photographer holding the heads of her subjects which also feels demeaning to the Japanese men portrayed in the picture: Japanese are not very touchy and touching ones head is generally not a good thing in most Asian cultures: the impression is of a woman and her two dogs. Not nice.Later in the book you find the photographs blurry and the picture text very poor: you could have filled these huge pages with a lot of informative and captivating text about Japanese tattoo and culture. Instead you get to read what is pretty much: ""this man has a fish tattoo""."
2,The Japanese Tattoo,"I was disappointed with how the illustrations were presented. The explanations were done clearly, but not a book for those who are looking for ideas for new ink."
4,Nice product,Very nice deflector that fit my 2005 Pilot. I occasionally hear wind noises through the part that fits onto the car.It fits onto car nicely though so not a big deal. Deflector has helped with noise inside when I have my sunroof open.I would buy again!
5,Tiltle includes...,"I haven't bought this set and these reviews haven't been really helpful, so i did a little research. As suspected this title inculdes Caeser III, Pharoah, Cleopatra (expansion to Pharoah), Zeus, and Poseidon (expansion to Zeus). I've played all these titles seperatly and I absolutely love the series. This set is a FAR better deal than buying the titles individually. This is a real bargain if you ask me ;-)"
3,Basiclly the same game.,"All three of the games Pharoah, Caesar III, and Zeus are basiclly the same game just different cultures. And the expansion packs Cleopatra and Poseidon didn't add much to the game.The editor that came with the expansions really suck, they are too hard to understand and way too many things to mess with except the things I want to mess with. All in all it's just to difficult for me to be having fun. Now the game itself is pretty fun but there is NO good sandbox play. If I could do it over I would NOT have spent the $25.00 on this."
5,The best collection ever!,"This game is a must have for anyone who ever wanted to run their own country! I found it to be easy to play, fun and historically accurate. Overall, it is a great collection for a great price."
5,awesome and beyond comprehension,"Get this CD. Not sure I beleive all the hype surrounding it and the Chaino as African story is suspect (I think I read somewhere that he was from the Compton area) but get this CD. This is possibly the most raw and real and touch-the-nerves music on the planet.I see the producer Kirby Allan thanking others for this, but really, who but the producer could have corralled this rawness into something cohesive.Kudos to Chaino AND to Kirby Allan."
3,Classic Zone,"This volume only has 4 episodes but of course they're all good."" Kick the Can"" is probably the most popular one of the four especially since it was one in (Twilight Zone-The Movie). But ""Steele"" is my personal favorite of this volume. Lee Marvin stars in this one and in true Twilight Zone fashion it's kind of creepy. Each episode is only about 20 minutes or so,it's kind of a teezer."
2,Weak Twilight Zone,"This is one of the worst CDs I have seen in the collection, all four videos were duds in my opinion. Normally, the subtle themes of these series leave you with an interesting thought or idea; however, in this realm, all of these videos were pretty shallow. I would avoid-- Go with vol 2 instead."
5,Classic,"I bought this volume because it has my all time favorite episode ""Walking Distance"" When I watch it I always think to myself I wish I could do that. It's really a touching episode.."
4,Best Episodes of the Series,"A professional boxer was hired to train the actors for ""Steel."" ""Kick the Can"" was one of George Clayton Johnson's best stories, and features real-life father and son Ernest and Barry Truex. ""Walking Distance"" almost caused friction between musician Bernard Herrmann and script writer Rod Serling.Trivia supplied not from the DVD, but from the book, ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun. Both are available on Amazon."
4,Ancient to the Future,"Outside of its value as a polemic, the book is enjoyable for Armah's use of language, a stylized somewhat archaic diction that perfectly suits the telling of a legend--a legend and a mythology which Armah creates to re-examine history. It's like what Wole Soyinka said about it, the book makes new gods to replace the old ones which have been destroyed. Armah's at his best when launching into poetical observation and instruction (e.g. the beginning of Chapter 7). His narrative flow gets a bit bogged down with the stylization, and that makes it drag from time to time. But this isn't a book about plot or character, really: it's a social history and a vision of a future based on a reinterpretation of the past. As the Art of Ensemble of Chicago would say, ""ancient to the future""."
1,Disapointed - 2007 version is same as 2003 version,"This is great and wonderful educational video. I give it low rating only because - I ordered the 2007 version, assuming it would be different from the prior 2003 version (which we already have) with new interviews, updated aircraft & squadrons working on a carrier. Both are identical."
5,Excellent source of B-12 and a lot more.,"The principal beneficial ingredient in ""Mineral Rich"" is 1000mcg of Vitamin B-12 but it is accompanied by significant amounts of over 1/2 dozen important minerals as well. The pleasant tasting liquid can be mixed with juice or water. I then use that to take several other supplements that I use.My 89 year old mother and I have been taking Mineral Rich for years. The benefits are too numerous to itemize here and the quality of the product is remarkably high. The addition of the ALoe Vera only improved the product.Also, we've had a good relationship with Swanson (via Amazon) for over 1 1/2 years now. The one mistake they made (an item was omitted from our order) was corrected in a few days quite satisfactorily. We recommend this product, and this seller, very highly."
5,must need,I was having a real problem with being sick. I was just done with it. When I got so sick I couldn't eat. I decided to try this. I have only heard good things. It took about 2 weeks and I felt like i had my life back. I'm around a lot of sick people for work and have not gotten sick with taking it!
4,Waiting on the results.,I'm still on the first bottle. So the jury is still out. The product tastes great! I purchased three bottles to give it a fair chance.
1,Doesn't Work,I purchased this item because of reviews from youtube. Ladies raved about how it grew their hair. I have been taking it for almost a month. NOTHING!!!
4,Helped me get over a cold faster!!,"The day I receive this I happened to have been sick for the 4th time in 3 months with a cold. The reason why I ordered it in the first place was because of this and I thought my immune system needed a boost. I haven't really been getting the necessary vitamins and minerals I thought I needed so I thought I give this a try. I also heard that it was good for hair and nail growth which I never really had a problem with anyway so I didn't worry to much about that.I started taking the Mineral Rich right away and in about 3 days my cold was gone with just some minor coughing here and there, but I haven't been sick since which is great since I'm around so many people all the time. The flavor was good and it didn't bother my stomach at all and I didn't have any side effects like others have listed. I do take it after eating a full meal and I mix it in a glass of water."
4,Not bad,Purchased this product for my mom. So far no complaints from her. I would suppose it works for her purposes.
5,Must buy!,I have sooo much energy! You may want to take every other day because I started not being able to go to sleep lol. Nails have been strong and long and my hair full and thick. This is awesome!
5,The best adventure book ever!,"Wow! It was one of those books that I read a chapter every day and put it down just to savor it. More than any other adventure genre book, it makes you think about life, death and the way we live our lives. Thank you Mr. Ridgeway, Asia and Asia's Mom!"
5,Met my needs,"It met my needs, good width,, good catch to lockLike that it was made in America. Purchased 2 both are working out great"
5,Just what I needed!,"This gate is made of nice smooth strong wood with good quality fasteners. It's perfect for keeping my elderly dog from wandering freely when I'm not home. He doesn't challenge it. It might not do for a younger stronger dog...The great thing is, I was able to mount it on the side of the wall a bit back from the opening. This was easy to do with the included hardware, just turning the door sideways in the mounts. This way it's out of the opening, mostly, when it's open! I also mounted the catch on the side, opposite. It's easy to unhook and open with one hand.I'm really pleased with this product, especially for the reasonable price!"
5,These are great for those narrow openings most other gates are too big for.,"Narrow doorway? This will work for the most narrow of openings. I recommend them for only narrow doorways because like all accordion style gates, they are much stronger when they are not stretched out to full capacity. I'd also like to add that I have purchased 4 of these for a child care facility I used to service. I installed two, then months later at the managers request, two more because she was happy with the first two. As some reviews said, they are not the strongest gates, but they get the job done. These are meant as a deterrent for children, not necessarily a high security prison. All children should be under supervision even with a gate installed."
5,Great gate,This gate went up quickly and easily! It gets quite a lot of use and works like new! The price was great
1,Don't buy this gate,"I purchased this gate to keep our German shepherd out of the bathroom and the cat's litter box. It is very cheaply made and flimsy. The slat on the side where it fastens to the door frame split almost immediately. I repaired it with wood glue and clamps, and so far it has held up, but I know that this gate would not stand up to any kind of serious use. I recommend spending a little more money for a better gate."
2,Pictures Confusing,"When I was looking at this product I found the pictures confusing. There were two ""gates"" that I was looking at. I ordered what I thought was the one I wanted and got the other one.The add also did not give a size. How wide a space it would cover.It was not worth the shipping to send it back, and I have found uses for them."
5,GREAT CONSTRUCTION,THE GATE IS WELL PUT TOGETHER. HOLDS UP UNDER ACTIVE USAGE. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO WOULD ASK ABOUT IT.
3,good use for the small dogs I have,"while it seems a bit flimsy, it serves it purpose. The pins that attache each section do come unscrewed, so, I re-tighten them every so often."
4,"A ""retro"" design, economical and effective","I've used these accordion-type folding safety gates for decades. Apparently, they no longer make the beefy ones with large members, and large gaps between the wooden slats (presumably because of tougher building codes that require smaller gaps to prevent a child's head from getting caught?). No matter, this lighter gauge gate does the job reasonably well for being built of small dimension hardwood. Installation is simple (as in the old days), function is flawless, and if you use it AS INSTRUCTED, it should provide reasonably dependable service. Durability will probably not match the folding gates of yore, but I'll wait a couple years, and maybe re-rate, if I'm proven wrong!"
4,More chills from the ultimate bogeyman,"Halloween: The Mad House is the scariest book yet in Kelly O'Rourke's series based on the famed franchise. The creepiest suspense sequences, the grisliest deaths- it's plenty frightening all around. The author settles into the by-now familiar formula of teen soap opera meets horror thriller, but things pick up a lot sooner in this one and it's good enough to be adapted as a new sequel if Dimension decides to resurrect Michael Myers again."
3,Grunts & Groans,"I'd just like to say, I found this book a little childish, but then, maybe that's because it is meant for children. It doesn't seem to have any continuity with the movies.I've noticed a lot of people complaining about the fact that Michael grunts in the Book, but not in the movies, but this is in fact not true, as any real Halloween fan would know.He grunts repeatedly in the first movie, when he is fighting with Laurie, just before she pulls his mask off. He grunts repeatedly in the second movie, when he is trying to stab Laurie, just after he gets shot in the Eyes. He grunts a few times and lets out a muffled ""Agh!"" in H20 when Laurie repeatedly stabs him (just before he falls of the balcony)........I wouldnt say he Groans much though! :o)This book is an obvious cash in, but it could be fun for ""Shape"" starved kids out there."
1,Not worth the money,"Product is made by Classix, 100% polyester from Korea1. Collar is not exact fit as you would be led to assume when ordering, it is an EZ fit collar which is elastic2. Stitching is poor3. Cuff is not a true french cuffMight as well get a rental tuxedo shirt as this is what a rental shirt looks like"
5,She love it.,"This little but informative book was a hit for my mom-in-law. She thought she knew all about flowers, but no. She was amazed at all the facts in this book. A real nice present for flower lovers.!!"
5,Worked for Us,"I don't have anything to which I can compare this, but this one did the job. I think any bottle rack would probably work well, so I recommend getting the one that costs the least. I guess the slanted feature is helpful, and the plastic spike thingys are removable. I've cleaned it in the dishwasher and it has held up well."
3,Simply Not That Valuable,"When I was a conducting student in the USA I was largely taught from this book. I found it simplistic then and still feel the same. It is not in the same league as something like Gunther Schuller's The Complete Conductor, Prausnitz' Score and Podium, or the more recent Morgenstern No Vivaldi in the Garage."
4,Not enough Mae,"Overall a very good quality CD considering it is over 30 years old. However although Mae was great with songs, there should have been more of Mae and less of the other people on this CD."
1,Disappointing,"Just as the other low rated reviews say, these are NOT the original recordings. I bought the first 3 volumes in a store thinking they would be original, but was disappointed when I listened. Attention TeeVee Toons: I won't buy any more of your products because you can't be trusted to clearly identify the music as reproductions. Remember the old line, ""would you buy a used car from this man?"" TeeVee Toons is the BUY HERE, PAY HERE, USED CAR SALESMAN of TV songs!!! Would you buy a song from this man? NO! Run as fast as you can if you want originals!"
4,Bring back old memory,"Listening to this CD had brought you all old memory of the childhood. If you grown up during the 60's era this CD will bring you early days. Love the movie Flipper, Daniel Boone etc. Love it."
4,A good selection of classic theme music,"I'm very happy with this disc. It's true that a few of the selections aren't the original televised music, and that some sound like they were recorded straight from a 3"" television speaker. But most perfectly convey the theme song, and some of the ""faults"" noted by other reviewers don't bother me a bit. For example, a few cuts splice the opening and closing credits into one piece, but these usually sound like two verses of the same song and are perfectly acceptable to me. The muddy sound on some selections doesn't bother me because it sounds just like television used to sound -- complaining is a bit like griping that LPs have pops and crackles. I think this disc is perfect for trips down memory lane, as well as for appreciating how well-crafted many of the theme songs were. It would be nice if original recordings could be obtained yet engineered with better sound, and I'll save my fifth star for the disc that does it."
3,ok,"This CD is ok but not as good as vol 2, 6 and 7 of the Television's Greatest Hits collection, there are some good themes on this but most of the shows I have never even heard of and some of the themes sound like they have poor sound quality, but even though some of the themes on the CD are disappointing it is a really fun CD to listen to and I just listen to the tracks I like and skip what I don't like."
2,Huge disappointment,"I bought this collection with the naive notion that I would get 65 pieces of nostalgia. Instead, I got 40-plus re-recorded, hollow attempts to bring the originals' spirit alive. The rest were real, but most were the cartoon themes, and some of them (""Flintstones"", ""Bugs Bunny"", ""Yogi Bear"") sound like they were recorded off a ""nostalgic"" fifties TV set with a ""nostalgic"" mono tape recorder. I know for a fact that better recordings of these exist, so why didn't they use them? Only a few of the live action themes were the original versions in decent fidelity (""The Munsters"", ""The Addams Family"", ""Mister Ed"", Green Acres"", ""Superman"", ""The Mod Squad""), with ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" sounding as bad as the aforementioned three. I've been swindled!! I heard here that later releases did a better job, but I see no reason why I should plunk down another 17 bucks to get any of them."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you want the original recordings, don't purchase any volume of Television's Greatest Hits. I've had better luck recording the songs off of my TV with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my PC. These collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""The Munsters"" that just don't sound right to me. If the original recordings don't matter to you, then you may like this CD."
2,Buyer Beware!,"Only a handful of the themes on this CD are taken from the original recordings used on the programs. The remainder are arrangements, some on synthesizer. It's like the CDs you find of oldies recorded by the original artists, but are only ""new stereo recordings"" and not the original recordings you were expecting. I bought this CD specifically for the Captain Kangaroo theme, only to hear it being played on a synthesizer! And at a much faster tempo! Surely a recording of the original song actually used on the show exists somewhere! I have really enjoyed other CDs from TeeVee Tunes and was expecting more. I was very disappointed."
1,Record the Originals or Don't Bother!,Most of these are re-renditions of the originals. Most people shopping for a CD like this would know right away upon hearing the samples that this CD is not what they're looking for.Who has produced CDs with ALL ORIGINAL recordings? This CD deserves zero stars.
4,"""And a 1, and a 2, and a 1, 2, 3, 4...""","I bought this album in LP form many years ago. I am only just now getting around to updating to CD and adding to my collection. This is a great place to start for truly ""classic"" theme songs. There are many gems on all of the series but, in later volumes, it becomes more of a theme song to a ""classic"" TV program. There is a differnece. Many of the songs on the first few volumes are true classics in their own right, as pieces of music that can still move us today, not just as nostalgia for beloved programs. I would suggest that one should aspire to acquire the entire selection. Not as a CD that will get a lot of play time on your stereo per se, but as a valuable addition to anyone's music collection. As a TV and music trivia buff, I find these collections a valuable resource."
5,An in depth look at U2,"This is truly a very well written description of U2, the people that surround them, and the lives they live. You truly feel like you are living with them in their lives and following them throughout their career. Bill Flanagan did an excellent job of remembering and writing all the experiences that he went through while traveling with U2. This is a funny, understanding, and heartwarming look into the lives of famous rock and roll stars. This book definetely helps you realize that rock and roll stars work hard and have lives as well. If you are a U2 fan, or not, this is truly the best book about them you could ever read. Your appreciation for the fast paced lives of U2 and other rock 'n' roll stars will definetely grow."
4,Good Read,"I agree with some sentiments about Flanagan using this book as a vehicle to almost display his intellect and his synergy with the band, I think he is quite in awe of the band and Bono in particular, having said that this is the only U2 book that provides this level of insight and personal connection with the band and the supporting people behind the group and through personal comment and annecdotal inferrence you get a good intimate insight into the band, and it follows a timline through Achtung Baby and through the Zoo TV tour that makes the book a very enjoyable read. I drop one star for the autobiographical nature of the book."
5,"This U2 book is awesome, love it!","I am enjoying reading this book about the best band of all time. It's a great insight to what goes on behind the scences, I will definitley be getting the new book out this September, U2 by U2, they ROCK! Awesome book!"
4,Was a WILD ride!,"I had a great time reading this book -- it was an interesting look at life on the road, the music business, European politics! The point of view here is interesting and the writing smart. I just wish the book were more equally about all four band members (though I know Bono is his very own case study!) Even if you're not into biographies or rock music or both, this is a worthwhile read. I felt like I was on tour, too!"
2,Flanagan is In desperate need for an editor.,This book is not about U2. It's about Bill Flanagan and how he fits into U2's world during Zoo TV/Outside Broadcast/Zooropa. Yawn....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
2,Armitage's Garden Perennials,This is a nice book but not what I thought it was going to be. I am taking an online course for Perennials and this book was suggested as a suppliment to the textbook. It is a nice picture book that you can use to identify a flower.
4,Armitage's Garden Perennials: A Color Encyclopedia,"Good pictures and good information. Useful as a book to show clients a picture of plants in a plan. Could use a consistent, easy to find section on the plant requirements. As a reference for designing this would help in finding appropriate plants for the project at hand."
2,Armitage's Garden Perennials. A Color Encyclopedia,"Very disappointed. For the price I thought it would be comprehensive, but too many perennials in common usage are not included. Also, no visual distinction in writeups between description and how-to-grow, so you have to do a lot of reading to zero in on the information you want. What I like about it is that the author provides opinions as well as descriptions, the photos are very good, and the information helps you choose among perennials and among their varieties."
3,Armitage Garden Perennials,"I wanted a book that had a section of height and description of the flowers and how long the blooming season is and whether it did well in sun or shade. I would like to have been able to just open to the flower and find that information all in one place, but I have to read through the entire information on that particular plant to find all of this, so the book is not as useful to me as I thought it was going to be. It takes up too much of my time to find out what I want to know. I would like a better description of the books so I know more if it is what I want before I buy it."
2,SCISSORS DONT SPRING BACK RIGHT,"I bought these scissors for my 3 yr old who is having difficulty learning to cut because of hand strength issues. Her preschool teacher recommened getting some scissors similar to these. I ordered these because they have a spring back so after she squeezes to cut, she doesn't have the difficulty of opening the scissors to make a second cut. After using these scissors once, she now has to pull them open because the spring back function is not working. I am not overly happy with this product. I had high hopes but they failed to work the way we needed them to after the 1st use! Im not sure what brand the preschool used but theirs worked MUCH better than these! : ("
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with these scissors. I had them for only one week and used them 3 times to cut paper and noticed they were cutting funny. As I was holding the scissors up to look at the blade to see if it was bent or something, I squeezed the scissors and one of the blades came off. It looked like it just snapped off clean where the blade inserts into the handle. Not fixable."
4,Art for the non-artist and more,"Though I did not approach soul collage with the intent of using the ""cards"" in a deck for reading, I followed the techniques for using collage for self-discovery. It is an amazing process requiring only scissors, card stock, a glue stick and old magazines. I have worked with a number of people using ideas from the book and frankly, the non-artists not only produced beautiful gifts of expression, but in most cases did better than the artists. I highly recommend this book."
3,SoulCollage,The book was sent in perfect condition...however thought it would have color illustrations which is not the fault of the seller. It is an interesting psychological tool more than art. I enjoyed using the book however as art therapy in a workshop setting!
2,Too Black and White for Me,"Hi, for a book on collage, the all black-and-white collage examples are a little dreary. A little color wouldn't have hurt a bit, also some basic instructions on actually making collages--materials, process, etc. Evidently ""Soul Collage"" is a franchise of some kind, and there appear to be centers where you can take workshops, all over the place. So it's kind of an advertisement for the Soul Collage empire. Most of the text focuses on how various Soul collagers have found insights in to their problems and recognized heretofore unknown aspects of themselves, to their delight, etc. This book seems to be aimed primarily at seekers rather than artists."
3,It's eye candy,The book itself was somewhat clumsy to hold and manage... it's wide.The information within is good but feels somewhat incomplete. The images are amazing and plentiful but would have been better if they had all been in color as opposed to back and white.It's an ok book and it could have been better....
2,Creepy,From the review I thought this might be a Christian based art book. It is not at all! It kind of gives me the creeps actually.
4,Soul Collage: An Intuitive Collage Process,"I like this book. It contains useful collage information, wonderful examples of works done and a unique perspective on obtaining ideas for doing the collage. You esentially end up with a beautiful psychic tarot deck, very intuitive and fun. I do wish it had more color pictures."
3,Not for everyone,This book would possibly be good for a group working together. I haven't really given it the time that I think it requires to benefit from it.
4,Going to Church for Sure!!!,If you want a CD that will give you the memory of the old time church- This is the CD for you. It will take you back to that soul searching times- those Friday night shut-ins!
1,Poor Execution,"This album was a huge disappointment for me. I had heard the song ""Holiness"" before I bought it and I thought it reflected the rest of the album so I bought it. I was wrong. Micah's songwriting ability is bland and lyrically challenged. Also, I find him to be more of a screamer than a singer. He needs balance."
3,Good documentary - disappointing extras,"While not exactly loaded with explosive new insights, this documentary is well worth a look for Bond fans. Entertaining, some nice clips and moves along briskly. The extras on this disc, however, are practically worthless. The 20 question quiz, for instance, will be annoying to the fans who instantly notice incorrect information and just plain pointless for most everyone. It's worth renting, but I wouldn't rush out and buy a copy."
3,Bond...,"A short DVD about the worlds greatest spy films. Includes some good interviews and insights into the films. If you own all of the Bond movies though, you can watch the special features and get a lot of the same with out buying this."
3,hmmmmm... good... But FAR from good enough!,"I finally got mine in the mail today, as I am a James Bond fan.BUT gosh darnit, all this information is all known for the smalliest of James Bond Fans. It wasn't anything Special. They didn't also highlight some of the more dramatic parts.Like How Iran orignaly wote James Bond to die in From Russia With Love (Or Goldfinger can't remeber) Or how Casino Royal was on TV years before Dr. No. which was the First James Bond.. which he was titled Jimmy Bond because america didn't want a british thing.What Roger Moore thought when that girl he had sex with in For your Eyes only turned out to be a male.Sean Connery only makes about 3 or 4 Appearences. HE NEEDED MORE! He is BOND!hmmmm this is something all bond fans should get... but still this isn't as good as it could have been. FAR from even a feathering of what it could have been. I Should have been the one doing this story."
4,Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Bond Bond ! James Bond,Everythig you wanted to know about the James Bond phenominon but were too shy to ask. Then this Bud's for you. Do you like your Martini's shaken but not stirred? Do you like your women exotic and action starved? Is your company car an Aston Martin? Do you have a lot of cool gadgets in the workplace? Then maybe this is your life and your name is James Bond secret agent 007 licensed to Kill.
3,James Bond Count,"Correction there, West Virgina. There have been 20 'official' Bond films. Never say Never Again was a remake of Thunderball by another studio. Thunderball's producer, who co-wrote the novel, also produced the remake. There is also the parody, Casino Royale.Connery- Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only live Twice, and Diamonds Are Forever. Just 6"
4,"Um, there were 19","Never Say Never Again was indeed a remake of Thunderball, but it wasn't produced by same people who produced all the other films (Cubby Broccoli & company, later his family members who took over the helm of the Bond series). Like Casino Royale, it's not technically a true Bond film, it just has the character.Having addressed that important point, this is a good gift for a Bond fan or an introduction to those just getting into the world of Bond. The interviews with the former Bonds are especially enlightening."
4,And now a word from our sponser,Good commercials from the days when cigarettes were still advertised.Listen to how the TV and radio sounded before all get rich quick and credit mediation ad's took over the airwaves.
4,"And now, a word from our sponsors...","This is a collection of TV commercial ""jingles"". Remember those timeless classics like ""Sometimes You Feel Like a Nut"", ""I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke"" and ""Meow Meow Meow Meow""? Well, those are here, and so are over 50 others. The recording quality isn't too good on some of them, but what do you expect? This collection is a lot of fun for people who watched too much television in the '50s, '60s or '70s."
5,Remember when,"This Cd brought back a lot of memories, brought back a lot of childhood memoreis , forgot about some of the songs, but soon as I heard them remembered how we use to sing with them on TV."
3,Substandard by comparison to the rest of the series. . .,"I must admit that this album was somewhat of a disappointment. There are a number of jingles here that brought back a smile, but some are slick remakes and others not the most memorable choice for the given product.For those who own the rest of the series, or someone who really enjoys advertising jingles, this is a worthwhile investment. However, as a stand-alone or for someone who wants only originals, TeeVee Toons - The Commercials may leave a sour taste in your mouth."
4,Aliens Don't Wear Braces,I read Aliens Don't Wear Braces. I thought it was a very interesting book. I liked it because it was different from any other book I read. That's the reason I liked it was something I never thought about and I like reading those kinds of book. I recommend kids 8 through 10 to read this book because it boosts a kid's imagination and they need to do that. I think kids should read books because kids should read instead of playing video games or watching TV. You would be rotting your brain and this is a good book to read. Everybody should read kids especially. Parents should read too.
5,Just right,This was a perfect solution to sharp corners and edges on our wood entertainment center. The chocolate brown color blends in better than could have been expected (my husband didn't even notice I had attached it to the entertainment center until I pointed it out to him) and it was easily cut to fit. The double sided tape adhesive strips hold on tight and the package came with a lot of extra tape strips to allow for errors and/or re-positioning or reusing in other areas. I highly recommend this product!
4,A little pricey but good protection,The 3M tape really does not work to keep this product attached. I used 3M Super 77 Spray Adhesive-granted it would not be fun to remove that adhesive from wooden furniture. We put this on wooden tables in the toy department at a thrift shop and using that adhesive it is hard to pull off the table guards. I think the item is over-priced but the cushioning and protection factor is very good.I would highly recommend it.
4,"Soft, cushioned protectors","I normally buy the guards from local home centers (white/grayish colored), and stores charge $10 for 4 corners, and another $20-30 for straight guards with equivalent lengths. So this is a good real good deal for me. It was also perfect that I was looking for darker brown guards this time.These are softer than what I was used to, and I think that is good as it can give a little. The adhesives are instant and strong, which is great once installed in place. However during the installation (sticking to the surface), I had to pull up quickly several times after sticking because the straight guards are soft and easily give in when the adhesives are not in a straight line.There are sufficient dual-sided adhesive strips to cover all, no more and no less."
3,They work OK,"For the most part they do (did) their job. But as many other people have mentioned, my 14 month old twins just rip these off and they are now useless."
5,Plenty of cushion and adhesive,"The product comes with several strips of 3M double tape, which seems tp have a lot of strength. My one year old has tried to pull it off the table and has not had success. Compared the the Kidkusion I bought for the fireplace, this one has a much stronger bond when applied."
3,It's okay for what I needed it,The guard came heavily distorted from probably sitting in the box for way too long. The fragment of about 20 inches in length had to be cut off due to severe distortion. I used the guard to cover the fireplace brick edges and it worked out fine since I didn't need the whole length. I would have given it one star and returned it if I used to to cover a table.
4,Saves a lot of bumps!,"Easy to put on, but sometimes easy to come off! The only problem we have had is with the cornors. 2 of the 4 have come off in 5 months time, which isn't too bad. My son pulled one off and the other one came off because with getting up and down from the couch we bumped it a lot and it came off. Rest of it has stuck great, but we make sure we keep little hands from pulling it off! One thing we were worried about was the finish on our coffee table, but the tape is great and doesn't take any of the finish off, which makes us feel a lot better! Still better then the ones that have elastic in them, those are very easy to take off, but I wish this product would either come with stickier tape, or extra tape!"
1,horrible,"i bought this product and i am very dissatisfied with it. i placed the foam on the edge of my coffee table, and without child pulling on it, it started coming up. on the back of the box it states that this product will not harm furniture, yet i am going to have to restain my coffee table because the stain is peeling up with the tape!!!!!! the double sided sticky tape doesnt stick well to the foam either. do not buy this product if you plan on using it on wood surfaces!"
1,Sticky Tape Not So Sticky,"We bought this product to protect our 9 month old from bumps and bruises. I installed it one night while she was sleeping and the very next morning, she figured out how to get the corners off! By afternoon, she had figured out how to also get one of the long pieces off! I found it difficult to cut to size, and it obviously does not stick. I am going to purchase one of the expandable guards (I have one on my coffee table now and it works very well!)."
2,Poor Adhesion,"This product does not adhere well. I have tried it on wood, metal, and painted surfaces. What's more, other ""safety"" products I have purchased that use well-known 3M tape were defective as well. Also, when I tried to remove the cushion, the tape removed my furniture paint. Overall, I rate this item with 2 stars because the neutral color does not attract my toddler's attention and the cushion does prevent painful head bumps."
5,Multiple Uses for this Item,"We bought and used the protector strips for the edges of our walls. There were 3 corners that we were concerned about our 1 year old falling into. The ""Sticky Tape"" portion was VERY easy to attach and stayed in place extremely well. I simply measured the height I would need, cut with a pair of shears and attached. It was every bit worth the money we paid for the product. I actually had to remove one portion of the ""Sticky Tape"" and it peeled right off for me, but not my Son. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. I only wish that I had known about this product when my daughter was a toddler. It would have saved us a couple of calls to the Doctor. I would try any product from Prince Lionhart."
1,save your money!,Good idea but this is very cheaply made... it is not sticky enough to stay on anything... my 6 month old baby would just yank it off immediately. I wish I never purchased this because you'd basically have to crazy glue to your furniture and there's no way I am doing that!
2,Defective parts,this looks like a good product and I ordered two of them but the double stick tape was dried out and impossible to use! I have to get some other form of adhesive if I want to be able to use this product. not happy at all about having to make additional trips to get this to function properly. :-(
1,Do Not Buy!,"As many others have written this product is NOT safe for wood furniture. Whe we removed it it actually pulled the finish off of a brand new Crate and Barrell table we had. Using several different solvents, a nylon pot scraper, about two rolls of paper towels, and a LOT of elbow grease I was able to get the massive amount of remaining adhesive off without doing further damage. Although the company does include a short disclaimer about how they are not liable for damage to tables, elswhere in the packaging materials it clearly states that the product CAN be used on wood furniture. They even show the product on a wood table in their advertising! I can't state emphatically enough that this product WILL damage your table - only use it on wood furniture you don't care about."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!,"This product is absolutely terrible! The corners fell off repeatedly, without my son even touching them. The double stick tape does not really stick. Basically, the guards have become teething toys for my son. So, if you're looking for a saftey product, don't buy this one. Another company makes an elastic cushion that fits around the table - now that is a good product. Buy that one if you can!"
5,Excellent product - saved my furniture from my son's teeth and saved my son's head from my furniture!,"This product was very easy to install. It required to be cut into the specific length desired, which was a piece of cake with regular scissors, and stuck to the table edges - again - very easy. The colour fits perfectly with my decor and does not look cheap. The cushiony texture of the guard gives me peace of mind when my 11-month-old stumbles around my coffee tables. We've installed this guard approximately 1 1/2 months ago and so far, it has stood the test of baby teeth and picking.I have yet to attempt taking them off so I do not know if it will damage my tables yet."
5,Works Great!,My 16 month old son took a header off the couch onto the corner of the coffee table. He ended up with a bloody nose but he was fine. However I'm sure it would of turned out completely different had I not used the edge guards. Sure glad we didn't have to make a trip to the ER that night. Those things are pretty solid. Very thick padding.
5,Great product,Easy to fix and it is surely a protective cushion. Now i now i don't have to worry about my baby hitting his head on edge of hard suffaces
2,Baby loves pulling it out,My baby loves peeling it off and walking around the house with it. The protection is good but is not helpful because it just wont stay.
4,Works great-easy to apply,I'm just worried for when i need to remove it! I might be purchasing new tables? I even used it on a wall corner near the play area. Stays fine. My son even tried chewing on it w his new sharp teeth. It held up. He was not able to puncture it!
3,"Products Works Really Well, But Buy New Table Later","I purchased two packets of the bumpers guards to cover both levels of my coffee table when my daughter started pulling up on things. For 7 months, this product stuck very well to the coffee table. Plus, it provided really good relief for my daughter when she was teething. It never even showed a single bite mark! When she reached 13 months, she was strong enough to pull one of the stips off the table. I tried to remove the tape, and found to my dismay that the job was nearly impossible! I could not imagine removing the tape from two boxes worth of table guards! My husband and I have decided to keep the bumpers on until after she turns 2 and then buy a new coffee table. This product works great ---- as long as you don't plan on keeping your table afterward!"
3,"Serves its purpose, but too easy to remove","I bought this to cover a tile edge in my step-down living room and to line my daughters window sills since they are only 6 inches from the ground. The padding is great and really protects her from bumping the edges, but she can pull it off very easily. Now she just tries to pull it off and chew on it, so we are costantly re-applying it. But it has helped prevent many bumps and bruises along the way."
2,Mom of a 6 month old,"We purchased this to put along the top of our rectangular coffee table as well as along the shelf at the bottom. Our 6 month old is rolling and scooting and is especially interested in the table. He has bumped his head a few times already.The foam is of good quality and was very easy to install but the tape does not hold well at all. My baby was able to pull off the foam without any problem, exposing the sharp edges. I would think that there should be a stronger adhesive in order to keep the foam on to do what it is supposed to do. A safety product like this definitely should not be able to be removed so easily - especially not by a baby.I would not recommend this product."
2,Be careful with this!!!,"While the idea of this is very good and indeed it did do it's job in covering edges, the adhesive doesn't do a very good job in keeping it on. The corner peices (which are the most necessary) come off very easily and one little tug by your child and the whole thing is off. What does NOT come off easily, however, is the adhesive from your TABLE! It says to ""rub"" it off, however all rubbing does is makes your fingers sticky. I ended up having to scrap it all off my table with my fingernail! So if you value your furniture, be cautious of this product!!"
4,Nice Product,We like the product and works very well. It's a little pricey but overall good product. We have purchased several.
2,Just Wasn't For Us,"I'm only giving this product two stars because it may work for someone with a baby who is still crawling, but once your child starts pulling up or walking the guards wont matter or last. My husband put them on the furniture when our daughter was asleep, thinking that she wouldn't notice them. Unfortunately, putting them on just gave her an extra something to chew on.The bad thing is that the double sided tape that comes with the guards is practically useless! Your child will be able to take them off. And to our horror, our daughter tried to eat them. We count it as a loss. Maybe if we buy our own double sided tape that's a little stronger."
4,So far so good,"These were easy to install and are aesthetically bearable. We'll see how easily my 8-month old will pull them off, but so far they are holding even though we've had some climbing onto them and such. I do wish that it came with a LOT more tape so that when it does come off I can just put it back on."
5,Effective for your newly walking little one,"Our 11 month old just started walking, so this stuff is awesome. We contemplated getting rid of our ""unforgiving"" tables, but thankfully we thought twice. All our friends with kids put their tables in the closet while they are going thru this ""falling on everything"" stage, and bought soft ottomans to use as tables, but we had no room to do that. So we bought this. We love it. Easy to install, and as long as they don't watch you put it on, they really don't even notice it. Our little guy bites on it when he teeths which I used to be concerned about because of PCBs but now I'm over that. I'm just glad his head is ok. My only complaint is that it doesn't list how long the roll is. We estimate it to be about 12 feet, possibly longer."
2,Non stick tape,"The bumper is made of good material, but the tape that comes with it doesn't stick worth a darn."
2,A little disappointing,"To be fair, I should have read the instructions before buying this. It works by using double sided tape to stick to your furniture. We have nice wood end tables. The instructions pretty much say that there's a chance you won't be able to get the adhesive off of your furniture when you're done. While I don't want my child to bump her head, there's got to be a better way. I'd like to still have this furniture once she's more stable."
4,"Enjoyable, but . . .","I have several of these such books, so my expectations maybe considerable.It was enjoyable with good pics, but there seems to be a trend in this genre for altering images and objects to have them appeared weathered, and worse for the wear. It's all getting a bit old, really. Scratchin, bleaching, peeling??? I am a (selling) collage artist and would be thrilled to see works that are truly organic taking root in the imagination first then heading off to world altered art.Good pics, good instructions . . . I'm just jaded.Enjoy"
4,intriguing techniques,"This book has several techniques I have not seen in other books. My interests are mostly in bookbinding, cardmaking, scrapbooking, rubberstamping, and other paper arts, and I found the ideas in this book were new to me, though they may be familiar to seasoned collage artists. I like the before and after photos, the gallery of ideas, and the variety of techniques covered."
2,A limited pallette,"I was disappointed enough in this book to take the trouble and expense of returning it. I read an article mentioned by others which gave a few techniques for altering photos. This book stretched out the article to book length without adding much besides bulk. The images shown were pretty bleak--take a bad photo, scratch it up, and what do you have? A bad, scratched up photo. NOT inspiring to even keep for eye candy."
4,nice showcase of art,"Reading this book was like visiting the museum for me. There's plenty of eye candy and inspiration and the author shares the techniques she uses to alter different types of images for her art. It's a lovely and varied showcase but though Michel describes the process of creating the artworks, it's not quite a step-by-step guide and may not be for people who aren't familiar with altering images or mixed media, or who prefer a more projects-type book with more detailed and visual instructions.I would use this book as a source for mixed media art ideas but if you need clearer instructions on techniques, I'd use a book likeSurface Treatment Workshop: Explore 45 Mixed-Media Techniques."
4,"The Complete Guide to Altere Imagery:Mixed-Media Techniques for College, Altered Books, Artists Journals and More","Some fresh ideas, I have many publications on this and similar subjects. This book has more creative and original ideas than most."
5,I like it!,"When I get the book it was a little bit different than what I though it would be. But I really like it, it's very artistic."
1,Highly Disappointing,Much too vague to be called the complete guide. A few helpful techniques are included but for the most part it was a huge disappointment. Think I will stay with the tried and true collage artists who are well versed in sharing their knowledge.
5,Yee-Haa,A wealth of daily inspiration. I fervently believe this book belongs next to everybody's hopper to be included in the morning rituals.
4,Hey...Good stuff.,"The item works great, in fact I'm using it as we speak(or type). I recommend it 100%, and trust me, I work for the military in the most harsh conditions, and my other thumb drives, just fails to meet the standard."
2,very disappointed,"When the mascara arrived, the tube read ""for display only."" The mascara was old and clumpy. Not worth the price at all and very misleading."
3,Pretty good,"I saw this on TV and was very impressed with the ""presentation"". In fact it is ""good"" but not at all like it looked on TV. Surprise, right?"
5,A great little book for a short trip,"I used this book on a long weekend in Budapest and found it extremely useful - especially the maps. It's particularly handy to have something small and light to bring along while exploring and this book covers the basics well. For a trip of a weekend or 5 days, you won't need anything else. Budapest is a wonderful city with very friendly people. Go there!"
5,Perfect,"These are great pans! I have 2, and they were wonderful for banana bread and also a sweet potato loaf... there was no sticking, perfect browning, and they were so easy to clean. They are very sturdy and the extra large handles are a great bonus!"
4,Okay Loaf Pan,"These are okay loaf pans. But they just felt a little bit flimsy, and I like sturdy bake ware that will last forever. So, I exchanged them for the Chicago Metallic Loaf Pans."
1,Short lived,The good news. There was more light. The bad. The bulb literally exploded after one hour of use sending hot metal parts into the lens ruining it. I did not touch the bulb with my hand either. I then bought a new lens with a standard bulb. I will be staying with the standards.
1,One burned out after two weeks,"Installed these in my Montana, one burned out after two weeks (no, I didn't touch the glass bulb during installation). My wife also commented after I installed these that they seemed much dimmer, she needed the fog lights on to actually see."
3,No significan difference,"I bought a pair of bulbs for my minivan. After about a year low beam of one bulb was gone, so I had a chance to compare GE Nighthawk with a standard bulb. I don't see a significant difference. I also doubt whether the beam is properly aimed or not. Anyway I don't buy this again."
3,"Cute, but I thought it would include all of the alphabet","This DVD is cute and there is a lot of information, but there are only a few letters used and they aren't in order. I wish the segments were shorter and they had included all 26 letters and in alphabetical order."
5,Gift GI Joe,Perfect. The packaging was great and the person receiving this gift was extremely pleased.
2,HOPING TO FIND ADVENCE TECH,"I BOUGHT IT FROM LOOKING AT HIGH STAR RATING, HOPING TO LEARN MORE ADVENCE AMMA TECHNICS AND TO MY DISAPPOINT, IT HAVE A VERY LITTLE AND BASIC TECH. WITH LOT OF TCM THEORY. THE MODERN AMMA IS VERY CLOSE TO THE SWEDISH AND THE DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE TOGETHER, PRACTICED WITH OR WITHOUT TCM THEORY. THE MODERN AMMA IS NOT DESIGN TO BE CLINICAL, RATHER PLAIN MASSAGE. THIS AMMA THERAPY IS NOTHING MORE THAN AMMA PLUS TCM THEORY,MAKING IT MORE CONFUSING AND MADE AMMA THERAPY AS REGISTERED MARK IS LIKE SOME HOW I PUT SWEDISH MASSAGE AND TCM THEORY TOGETHER, MAKING IT SWEDISH THERAPY WITH REGISTERED MARK AND NOBODY CAN USE THAT NAME WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. BUT THE QUESTION IS CAN I DO THAT. IF I DID THAT SOMEONE WILL BEAT THE DAYLIGHT OUT OF ME."
2,Too simple and sufficient coverage.,"Too simple and some rules may not apply to real problem, not recommend. But if you want to get the first book in writing intensive or want to have a quick look, you may leave it on your desk."
5,"Good, quick book",I need to create a class on biz writing. This book was great as it didn't get involved too deeply into the boring grammatical aspects. It instead focuses on general rules to write solid biz documents. It's useful. It's to the point.
2,Good but old,"The elements of business writing give good point to look at.But the book is old and sometime give weird information.It's not an important book to have but, but still have some info."
5,Great!,This thing just works. Simple and easy to install. It has more than enough power to close my gate and keep my puppies in.
4,How democratic is the American Constitution?,Text receive as promised per seller. Text received in condition per sellers description. Happy with purchase. Thank you
4,Defintely Worth The Purchase!,"While I don't necessarily agree with all the analyses or conclusions proffered, this is nonetheless a very well written, researched, and interesting read!"
3,Not Dahl's best,"Dahl is a fine scholar, as shown by his critiques, decades ago, of the leftist cliches of C. Wright Mills, and by his history of politics in the city of New Haven.There has been a falling off in the quality of his work in recent years, although sometimes the old fire is still there. In this book, I suspect, he is trying too hard to be accessible.One of his points in this book is that the judicial review of legislative actions has gone too far -- federal judges regularly usurp the proper province of elected officials. This view, of course, is shared by many on both the left and the right. Each side believes, naturally enough, that the courts that strike down its favorite statutes are tyrannically usurping power.In his discussions of judicial review, Dahl essentially alludes to issues that require careful consideration. His allusions just contribute to his display of populist values and pessimism about their implementation. They aren't analytically helpful."
4,Great primer on the real Founding Fathers,"Good scholarly examination of the Constitution in relation to the political philosophy of the Founding Fathers. I teach AP US History and will buy a copy for all teachers in our department and request our government classes make this a supplemental text. I would suggest this as a preliminarly reading for any student about to take a government or Foundations of American History survey class.The reading is not difficult and most High School students can understand the concepts presented, while college students can gain some advanced conceptual ideas, and private citizens interested in political debate over family dinners will be supplied with a wealth of ammunition for arguments as to the purpose and construct of the US Democratic-Republic."
2,Not discussed enough,"2.5-3 starsThis is an important topic but the author disappoints by avoiding an in-depth discussion. It had some interesting tidbits but was very repetitive. It could have been much shorter for the little he had to say. Anytime he came close to explaining something or detailing something interesting he would say `this is not the place to talk about this' or `there's not enough space to explain this'. Well, there would have been if he stopped doing this and stopped being so repetitive. I hope there's another better book out there on the subject because I agree that there are many problems with the way our gov't is set up. The electoral college has always bothered me."
5,Great Value,"For its limited purpose and reasonable price, this book is worth buying. It focuses on bringing up certain questionable areas of democracy contained in our constitution and given possible solutions. As a book that introduces or reintroduces certain political concepts, this book is thought-provoking throughout and well worth reading. It better aquaints one with the American system of government through open questions and then tries to add fuel to age old question of the best type of constitution. Plato and Aristotle introduced us to such a question and Dahl continues the never ending game of what is the best structure by which a political system should be based. This is a great book to read."
5,Excellent Product,"This cover still allows the baby's skin to breath. Waterproof pads made my baby sweat when he slept but this all cotton one allowed him to sleep comfortably. It is extremely easy to put on the mattress and cleans up beautifully, hold up after many washes!"
1,Poor Quality,"I just took this sheet from the package, washed and LINE dried it. The threads on the sides have already pulled out and it looks like I've owned it for years. Since it has been washed and was a gift, I am stuck with it. But I will not buy another one - and will probably have to replace this one very soon."
2,Are the characters supposed to be one-dimensional,"I picked out this book and really liked how the back cover sounded so set to reading it right away... I was disapointed.. the story although good and funny at parts lacked any warmth or empathy for the characters. It seemed the book was just full of descriptions of either products, clothes, or the main character (Diana's) body. And frankly I don't need to hear how perfect her breasts are one more time, give us a little more depth next time."
2,"repetitive, dull and you know what will happen after the first chapter","What a dull book, you will understand the entire story after the first chapter. I agree with another reviewer who said the characters seemed one dimensional, and the author is repetitive! I didn't read it page for page but it didn't take much effort to imagine the conclusion. Yawn! I haven't read anything by this author previously and certainly wouldn't seek out another story."
5,Bagshawe Does It Again.,"I have read quite a few of Ms. Bagshawe's books and have to say that this one is my favorite so far. It's fun to read about how Beautiful, but bitchy Diana Foxton goes from the top of the food chain down to the very bottom and right back up again. The book is also packed with lots of steamy scenes describing the animal attraction between Diana and her business partner, sexy Michael Cicero. Overall, it's just a really fun way to pass your time; Ms. Bagshawe always keeps you wanting more and never disappoints."
1,labeling,"Look people, if you are selling a book that is customized for a specific institution, then you should label it on AMAZON for that specific institution. I ordered Experiments in Physical Chemistry thinking i was getting the newest edition (8th). In stead I received the 6th edition customized for Rutgers University. This has happened to me twice after I returned the first book and ordered a replacement because of your poor ability to properly label what you are selling on Amazon. Thank you for making my first month of school painful. I really do appreciate it!!!"
2,"OSU Integrated Lab Students, Hear Ye!","Students were asked to purchase this textbook, and most students in the class agreed that it was more or less a waste. In six terms of lab, we did no more than three experiments out of the thirty or so in the book. The discussion is often at sucha high level that the 'trees in the forest' are hiddenby the surrounding fog. If you're taking the 300 or 400-serieslab courses at OSU, just stick with what's in thehandouts...that's what I did, and I got A's on about 90%of the reports. Even if the profs tell you to read S-G-N,don't waste too much time on it. As a research or reference book, S-G-N is fine and probably very useful (today I'man industry chemist, not a researcher). But if you'rean undergrad student taking labs at OSU or any school,put S-G-N back on the shelf for a rainy day orreturn it and get a refund."
5,Lots of info!,"It's a great wall chart, helpful for reminding you of the sequence. (Also, some of the exercise names don't mean much until you can associate them with a picture - this helps a lot on that front.)"
1,Not for Tanzania,"The coverage of Tanzania in this book is quite sparse. I did not find it to be useful at all, and a great disappointment. I then went out and bought Lonely Planet's book on Tanzania, and was very pleased with the depth of information it offered, including such things as maps of towns with locations of ATM's, hotels, etc and color photographs. This is a much more useful book if you are going to Tanzania."
1,Useless for Tanzania,"Three-fourths of this book is dedicated to Kenya. The addition of Tanzania was clearly an afterthought. The descriptions of lodgings are rather generic and there are only a few hotels, attractions, or restaurants listed. On Zanzibar, we did better with a 20 page pamphlet of ads than with this book. Don't waste your money on this book if you're headed to Tanzania or Zanzibar."
1,Horrible,Whatever you do- DONT buy this worthless book. Unless you just want to stay in 5 star lodges and do and see NOTHING ELSE. I had the Lonely Planet Kenya that I dragged with me backpacking in Kenya- It was wonderful. The East Africa Lonely Planet is great too. Save your money!
3,no music ?,"It kind of sucks there are no Hendrix recordings in this. It was still fun to hear about Jimi from his brother and childhood friends, and some of his other not so famous friends."
3,Why there are no reviews for oldies,"This is a decent expansion of one of the bestselling RTS games made. This almost, neccesary update will take down both strategies than made Allies useless in the basic game. I mean, the TANK rush and the tesla nightmare. 8 of 10 multiplayer games in RA1 will pick soviets for these reasons, and after several conversations with other gamers and forums, it was stated that after 3 minutes, there was absolutely no way to stop this technique with allies. Of course, sea can give you a chance, but, oh, players HATE sea, therefore you wont be able to make cruisers, whatsoever.You are doomed. Aftermath brings the solution, by slowing down certain building structures speed, allowing you to stop that pesky IN base multi tesla. And also you get some usefull units for the allies to get some chances vs the soviets. Not to forget that heavy tanks blockade protecting those v2 rockets."
2,It's not that great!,"This addition to the original Command and Conquer: Red Alert is fun for a while, but it gets boring fast. The add on levels are extremely hard, the units just buff up the Soviets more, so that they are basically unstoppable in multiplayer games. Another thing that really annoys me is that the new levels aren't supposed to go in any particular order, you can play them in whatever order you want."
2,Woody Allen's style but shallow method.,"Jaglom is not original in style and pretends to apply Woody Allen's style and method to his film.I thought I was watching ""Interiors"" or another drama directed by Allen."
1,the man has the consistency and essence of vomit,"I just saw this movie and would only buy the book if 80 million dollars was at stake. I am a woman, an attractive and intelligent woman and I am completely alienated from his ""vision"". He portrays only the Cathy Guisewite view of womankind and all woman should chase him down and put wasabi on his oily, phony, grotesquely malformed testicles. I have never been so repulsed by another human.I imagine htis review is not suitable in that I did not suffer it in book form but I feel the need to warn the inoccent."
2,not enough substance,"I'm sorry, this documentary is a nice introduction into Biblical scholarship, but does not have enough ""substance"" for long-time readers into the subject, to whom most of the information in this video is nothing new. The brief ""Acts"" or episodes does help to make a review of the basic points a little superficial. The ""cop out"" at the end (""perhaps we will never know...."") also prevents deeper insight."
5,A Wonderful Film,"This is a gem of a film, directed and written with heart and truth, at times it brought tears to my eyes, and in the next scene, made me laugh, as I have done much the same as the characters so deftly drawn by D.B. Sweeney. Anytime, an actor can take both sides of the camera, and craft a film so entertaining and rich, this is a film and director to be noted.Though the film concentrates on the three buddie's embraked on a life changing road trip, it is also noteworthy for the fact, that finally a director has given the veteran actor John McGinley the starring role he has so richly deserved after many many films. John's performance is bravura, going from alpha male bravado to being absolutely cratered as he realizes what is important in life, which is this: the friends we keep are the ""family"" we lean on. That is a universal theme that bears truth. Five Stars, you won't be disappointed."
4,worth it just for the commentary!,"I bought this movie just to see D.B. Sweeney & Moira Kelly on the screen again. Honestly, I'd pay to watch them make a grocery list together. What a lovely surprise that this is a good movie too. There are some terrific lines, enough awkward, happy and sad to make it real and John C. McGinley! After having watched this, I will watch & buy pretty much anything that Mr Sweeney is involved with because I can trust him to bring the funny, the real and the beautifully thought out.Sit on the couch with Hubby, open a couple of beers and enjoy."
3,OK,DISAPPOINTED WITH MOVIE. GOT IT BECAUSE D.B SWEENEY AND MORIA KELLY WERE IN IT. BUT KELLY IS IN ABOUT THREE SCENES AND HARDLY SAYS ANYTHING.
2,not good,"This movie was pretty bad. It's about three middle-aged guys who go on a roadtrip together. They've been friends for years.The entire beginning where we get to know the characters was extremely bad. No interesting features and just downright bad writing.The film does improve a little bit when the guys eventually go on the roadtrip (which by the way, takes FOREVER to get to that point, which means lots of mediocrity until the guys get in the car together and travel).The guys do very stupid things, like wreck their car, assume they've won the lottery when they really didn't and act like children, attempt to jump off the bridge when they get drunk and/or stoned to commit suicide, and lots of other silly things. One of the friends even lies to the other one about sleeping with his wife just to make a man out of him, but the writing is just totally poor so it's not interesting.Maybe other people can see the appeal in a movie like this, but the storytelling was just horrible the entire time."
5,A Wonderfully Eerie Read!,"I am not sure how I came about choosing to read this classic of a book but I am so happy that I did.The first page immediately captivated me. Shirley Jackson wove this inviting yet creepy tale with such a haunting narrative. The main character is so delightfully strange, and being in her head hearing her strange thoughts about how she perceives the world she lives in is so entertaining.One impressive aspect of the writing of this book is how the author manages to create this atmosphere, making you want to delve in further, while keeping it so simple. The complexity is really in the technique she uses to construct the story.I have started to read this story now for a second time -I definitely recommend reading it twice, there are things to be noticed by a second read that you could not have noticed the first time around.Happy reading!"
4,Finished in a day,"Definitely a page turner, finished within a few hours after purchasing! Well written and moves quickly-loved the main character and descriptions. Looking forward to further exploring Shirley Jackson's works."
4,Good Book,"This book was wonderful. The suspense was great, I just couldn't put it down. We Have Always Lived in the Castle keeps you guessing the entire time, taking forever to answer any questions you might have.It's about a girl, named Merricat, who doesn't get along very well with anyone outside her house, the Blackwood mansion. Everyone in the town constantly picks on her and makes fun of her for living there. Because of this, the outside world from her point of view is a terrible place. The only other people she lives with are her sister, Constance and Uncle Julian, the rest of her family died; this is the biggest question, how? But it's not like Merricat cares, she even seems to be happy about it."
1,Don't do it,I like Shirley Jackson. The Lottery is a classic. House on the Hill very creepy. This book? Boring. Very boring. Doesn't work. Don't waste your time; there are a lot of better books out there to read.
2,we have always lived in the castle by shirley jackson,"i don't like shirley jackson's writing style. itis very long and drawn out and there is no climax.she doesn't properly end her stories either. shesuggests and ending but never fully explains it.there is no rising action, intorduction, etc. toher stories as most would have. most authors usethis format for a reason -- it works. hersdoesn't, that's why no one else uses it.thank you for your time,Angela Bishop"
1,This book will put you to sleep!,"Well, first of all I only read like 3 chapters and that was enough!! I thought the characters were completely insane and the book just didn't seem to have a plot. I would not recommend this book at all! If you're into insane characters and you like to waste your time on a horrible book then maybe you should read it."
5,Best book ever written,"Absoluetly engrossing novel, filled with suspense, mystery, and madness. Had Jackson been alive in the 1690's, she would most likely have been tried as a witch for her ability to cast such elaborate spells on her readers."
4,"Horror, no....creepy, yes!","This book was definitely creepy at times but a horror story, no. I don't want to spoil the book for those that haven't read it but I knew right away who the culprit was. It was pretty obvious to me. A quick read. It had my attention throughout the entire time. Some parts I had to shake my head, the villagers-WTF???? I loved Jonas!!! So cute. Reminds me of my little kitty.The book cover is really nice. Stands out."
2,Obvious from the beginning,"I love Ms. Jackson's comedy, she has a wonderful eye for it but I really found this book dull, primarily because I saw through it very quickly. Dull characters make for dull books, and strange or not these characters plodded along on a well worn path, both lifeless and unimaginative(and I mean that). Strange or diseased is not always that imaginative because it's too easy. Jackson is always a good writer but she needed something with a bit more meat on the bone to flourish."
2,Fair,"Although it explores some creepy psychological depths, ""We Have Always Lived In the Castle"" never really rises to great storytelling - or great story, for that matter. It's a very inward, and at times repetitive, tale about a family that has, for better or for worse, become isolated from its own community. One problem is that after a short while, it generates little interest in the reader for people living in this doomed, backwards household - nor of the people living outside it."
3,Disappointing...,"This book, at many times, seemed to be leading to some big climax. Unfortunately, it never happened. There were some great moments in the story but they were few and far between. I felt as though this were just a first draft of this book, and after a few drafts, it could be great. It has wonderful potential, but even with its short length, it was hard to get through. Pick another book."
3,unresolved,"i found this book only moderately dull until i came upon its conclusion, which left many things unsaid (to say the least). I felt that the whole story lacked purpose without a motive for Merricat's unexplained decision to murder all of her family and why does she show remorse and Constance immediately cover for her?. This book was disjointed and left many unresolved and unexplained incidents."
3,too much filler not enough killer,"Yet again with Ms. Jackson, she has moments of incredibly interesting prose, but then too much filler. Too much silly dialogue that could be cut quite a bit. It seems as though just to make it novel length she fattens it up. The engaging parts however, are wroth the read"
2,Spooky and Delightful,"In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses."
2,Confused at the number of high ratings,I am scratching my head at the many stars given this book by so many people. I found it bizarre. I am sorry I spent any time reading it.
4,"reader from Jackson, Mississippi","A friend recommended Shirley Jackson to me, and this is the first book of hers I have read, and certainly not the last. I thought the plot of the book was almost uneventful, but when Jackson revealed the true murderess, I was shocked. I think what shocked me the most, however, was the nonchalant way in which Jackson surprises the reader with the true identity. She just drops it on the reader in a casual conversation between Constance and Merricat. Chilling."
4,Hauntingly Strange!,"The characters were strong, and their arrested development after the incident six years prior tot he book's opening was quite fascinating. Though not terribly unpredictable, it was thoroughly intriguing and well-written. The rather Gothic atmosphere was well-maintained from the very first to the very last page. Though brief (under 220 pages), this was powerful and riveting. I had read Jackson's short story, ""The Lottery,"" in high school, and after finishing this, I am even more curious about her other works."
4,Read At Your Own Risk,"This book is frightening. I mean, seriously, seriously frightening. It makes you want to crawl under the covers and hide for a while, in case Merricat Blackwood is waiting in the shadows of your bedroom. Shirley Jackson, as well as her main character, have seriously disturbed minds. However, there's something else about this book that makes you want to read it over and over again, in case you missed something. I just can't put my finger on it. It's creepy."
5,Enchanting story. Beautiful imagery and characters.,"I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House"

5,Awesome,Once I read this wonderful book I had to read it umpteen times. I just loved it. Every reading you find something new you missed before. I recommend you engross yourself in this good read.
3,slow and meandering,"Shirley Jackson's story has a subtle creeping horror underlying a slow, marginally interesting story of two women living as outcasts in their historic, gothic family home, the products of scandal and fear.This one takes a good amount of perserverence to make it all the way through to the end, and the end, while not entirely what the foreshadowing leads you to expect, is still pretty predictable. The benefit is that it's a quick read, and makes for fine rainy day reading when you're in the mood for something a bit creepy and otherworldly."
5,Inside the Mind of a Madwoman,"For me, this is much scarier than ""The Lottery"" or ""The Haunting of Hill House."" Very plausibly, Jackson puts us inside the mind of a very disturbed girl. The most frightening thing is, Jackson makes us identify with her and see parts of ourselves in her. Merricat is sort of a female version of one of Jim Thompson's monsters. This is a wonderful book to read when you've had a very bad day."
5,"Unsettling atmosphere, unreliable narrator, undeniably good read.","The Lottery is one of my all-time favorite short stories, but I'd never read any of Jackson's other works. We Have Always Lived in the Castle has a similar tone, balancing its unsettling atmosphere with an unreliable narrator to great effect, for a story that's delightfully open to interpretation while defying easy categorization.I'm planning to read all of Jackson's novels and collections now!NOTE: Lethem's introduction is better read as an afterword, lest his own interpretation spoil and color your own reading."
5,A Work of Literary Magic,"I am a voracious reader, and was never able to choose a single 'favorite' book until I read 'We Have Always Lived in the Castle.' I was immediately captivated by the ethereal narrative of the haunted and haunting Mary Katherine Blackwood, and the eccentricities of Constance and Uncle Julian add depth, humour, and sorrow to the book. Mary Katherine's perspective makes Cousin Charles a thoroughly despicable and intrusive presence, and it is enjoyable to speculate on how she might have dealt with him had circumstances not thankfully driven him away. 'We Have Always Lived in the Castle' is a bewitching novel."
5,It is me...,When I was a kid I had Merricat's habit of burying things and drinking words from a glass so they'd go away. My favorite book. I love it.
2,Maddening!,"My low rating for this book may not be entirely fair. This book does have some merit in that it contains a depiction of extreme mental illness and family dysfunction. For that reason, it's not entirely without worth. However, it was a frustrating read and not enjoyable, IMO, precisely because of the mental illness and dysfunction portrayed within. I don't want to spoil anything by complaining in too much detail, but it was frustrating for me to see such extreme mental illness handwaved away by the other characters. It's not funny or ""silly,"" this character is sick and it's being entirely ignored! I was left unsatisfied. None of the characters were relatable and their actions were beyond strange. I'm unsure what the point was."
2,OMG ROFL THE LASHES RULZZZZZ!,"From Smother Magazine [[...]]:The Lashes offer an explanation about why they're not another ""the"" band: ""Hi there, we're a power pop band named The Lashes. Our methods of execution do not need to be questioned. We totally pink swear that we're the real deal and haven't regurgitated the New Wave scenesters at all. And we're like stoked to be playing music again. After our stint in an advertisement for urban clothing, we're glad to be back to rockin' everything that needs to, you know, be rocked. OMG, The Killers totally copped our style, LOL, and like our label picked us up because we were totally original and it has nothing to do with the fact that they're totally trying to exploit this genre for all its worth! ROFL! By the way, do you know how hard it is to comb your hair the opposite direction and keep it there the duration of an entire show!?"""
1,More Like BAD,"Let me just say, I'm not a Seattle scenester, I'm not illiterate and I don't like the Lashes. Sorry! I found a copy of this EP in the used bin at my local record store so I thought I'd give it a spin - it was only a couple bucks. Needless to say it's going back to the used bin. Imitating the Strokes and the Killers is really played-out right now. What's the point? These songs are derivative with a capital ""D"". The world doesn't need one more moody-looking band with perfectly styled hair doing an inferior version of what's already out there. The music itself is almost passable but the lyrics are really DUMB! It's like reading a 12 year-old girl's diary. Even my friend said ""It sounds like these guys are about one year too late."" The Lashes are so derivative and unoriginal I almost suspect they were ""manufactured"" to be popular. Absolutely soulless."
1,follow the vibe,"im not going to lie, but i got hook with that first song in the cd.. then....i said ""what is this??"" no good at all after first song, and this review is from a person that haver heard many good pop punk bands from hagfish, big drill car, green day ,zoinks etc."
3,Is there something wrong with liking good pop music?,"(Note: I'd like to edit that to 3.5 stars.) So, I didn't really like ""Death By Mixtape"" the first time I heard it. I didn't really like it the second time I heard it. Maybe not even the third. But, I still kept playing it. And then it was stuck in my head and I couldn't get it out. So I bought this cd. No, it is not the best pop album I've ever heard. But, yes, it is well worth the six or seven dollars it cost. It's four really, really catchy songs that are just fun to listen to (gasp!) and play over and over. You should definitely check out the band's full-length, ""Get It,"" too. This cd shows the band is good, and ""Get It"" shows how much better they've become."
4,"Kids, your pants are full","Scenester, hipster, WHO CARES? The Stupid Stupid is a spectacularly chewy example of the kind of bubblegum power pop that anyone who has ever loved Redd Kross should hear. Hey, Ben--who's always got your back?!"
1,Cheesy Embarassing Trendy Teen-Pop,"This band tries to copy everything that's currently cool and fails miserably. Their unoriginal (and ultra-cheesy) power-pop may fool the average MTV teenybopper, but trust me, this really is awful stuff. What was Lookout Records thinking? Believe it or not, two of the songs are loving tributes to two different Seattle rock critics in a boot-licking attempt to win their favor. It didn't work, and in the process, every musician in town knows what kind of hustler's they're dealing with. One song is about how hard it is to be a rich scenester boy in love. BLECCCH! To make matters worse, their phoney-baloney press kit compares them to The Cars and Elvis Costello, and guess what, they sound NOTHING like either one. Don't say you weren't warned."
