2,if only it wouldn't break,"We liked the popcorn popper the 2 times it worked before the stirring rod broke off. Except, we didn't like that the butter did not really drip down from the ""well"". You put butter on top of the lid and it's supposed to drip into the popper. Instead, the butter sat there and halfway started to drip, then made the lid hard to clean. Bad design. Anyway, about our 3rd usethe stirring rod broke off! Pooey."
2,Too much work,"I loved the idea of this. I like movie theater popcorn, but this is nothing like it. It is too much work, kernels get stuck, and it leaves the room smelling like burnt popcorn for a couple of days. I gave it away and went back to microwave popcorn."
4,West Bend 8 Qt Popper,"Its a great popper, fairly quick and easy to clean. A little big compared to my old air popper, but definetly worth the upgrade. The main reason im docking it a star is because even though it says it can make and hold up to 8 qts of popcorn, it can not. I would say at max about 6.5 qts. And yes i did purchase the 8qt popper."
5,"popcorn just like at old-time ""picture shows""",obtain some coconut oil and you have the flavor that cannot be duplicated with any microwave popcorn. clean up takes a few minutes but effort is worth it.
4,great popcorn!,This is a really fun and easy popcorn popper. Makes terrific popcorn too! Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the nonstick surface doesn't last long but doesn't seem to affect the performance or taste.
3,The Smaller One is Better,I have purchased both models of the Stir Crazy Corn Popper. And they both performed OK. However the popcorn was much better in the smaller version. The larger one gets too hot too soon and has a tendency to burn the popcorn if your not careful and remove it as soon as stops popping.
4,Great Popper,I think the Stir Crazy popper is great. The only reason I didn't give the item 5 stars is that the base cannot be washed in the dishwasher. It would be nice if you could remove the cooking surface and put it in the dishwasher.
4,Stir Crazy 8- quart popper,"It works great, it pops a ton of popcorn and it is fun to watch.The handles do get hot so I flip mine with my oven mits on."
5,Popcorn Lover,We love this popcorn popper! I have a large family and it makes a large amount of popcorn at one time with very few unpopped kernals!I highly recommend this popper!
1,Creating Games in C++: A Step-by-Step Guide,"Warning!!!! Warning!!! Do not buy this book!!! Too bad there is not a rating for zero stars. I am not a computer novice nor a programming beginner. The Good: The author tends to write in a very simple and straight forward way that makes the book easy to read and understand. The Bad: Too bad none of the code or examples work, including the infamous LlamaWorks2D engine that the book is centered around. Oh and by the way, the so called website for the engine does not exist. Question: How can anyone with a conscious ship this garbage knowing that none of the code works? Answer: Someone that needs to pay the rent, because they can not get a job programming."
3,Soap Complete Season - Suited My Needs,"I bought this for my 15 year old daughter. My husband and I made the mistake of starting to watch Soap on Netflix. Well we didn't get the chance to see all the seasons before Netflix removed it. So for her birthday, I bought her the complete set. I did read other reviews about packaging and missing content, but since she wasn't around for the first run of the show, she doesn't know what she is missing. Basically this filled my need, and since we are not Soap enthusiasts, we can live with the missing content. Packaging is ok, it probably could be a little better."
5,Soap - The Best Spoof TV Ever Offered,"I forgot how funny this sitcom was. Richard Mulligan steals the show with just his facial expressions. The rest of the cast is wonderful, too. There are so many character actors that showed up in other shows and movies years before and after this show. It was fun seeing the actors who would eventually end up on other shows together. Richard Mulligan and Dinah Manoff (Empty Nest), Katherine Helmond and Doris Roberts (Everybody Loves Raymond), Robert Guillaume and Inga Swenson (Benson). Considered one of the most controversial sitcoms of it's time, it's pretty tame by today's standards, but still a lot of fun. Check out a young Billy Crystal playing a homosexual."
4,Classic Comedy SOAP,"All four seasons of the classic comedy SOAP is a lot to digest. Sixty hilarious ""hour long"" episodes tell the boundary testing story of two sisters and their families. In its day, this series offered a tongue in cheek exploration of the extremes of the soap opera. It is an enjoyable experience to revisit the silly side."
3,"Great Program, Poor Packaging","Soap was a great show and it's wonderful to have every episode in one set, but the packaging is terrible. Every disc is stacked on top of each other on a spindle. I had to move every disc into a special protective booklet. Also, would it have killed the studio to throw in some special features? Just one interview with the creators on Season 2 doesn't cut it. This was a significant show and it deserves more recognition than that."
2,Great price. Lousy packaging.,"This is a great price for one of the best comedic shows of the seventies. It includes all four seasons and ends with the unresolved cliffhanger at the end of season four. For this alone I would give the set four or five stars but the packaging is so infantile and atrocious that I actually recommend NOT buying this set and waiting for the individual seasons to drop in price or go on sale. The packaging is a cardboard slipcase that contains what basically amounts to a molded plastic spindle (like you would buy a pack of 50 blanks) that fits in the cardboard box. The discs are all stacked on top of each other! There's no episode guide. Nothing. This is as about as far as you can take ""No Frills"" without just putting the discs in paper sleeves. I'm actually going to purchase blank DVD cases and scan the cover to make my own cases. Get the series for this great price but only if you dare."
1,LOVE THE SHOW - HATE THE PACKAGING!!!!,"Agreeing with the other reviews, I contacted Sony Home Entertainment regarding the terrible packaging and here's their reply:Thank you for your email. We appreciate your questions, comments, and feedback of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (SPHE) products.Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Company Policy does not include replacement of the items you requested.We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your continued patronage and taking the time to contact us.Regards,SPHE Consumer Affairs TeamObviously, Sony doesn't care (as of yet) and wants my DVD collection to get as scratched as possible (so I eventually replace it).Buy the individual seasons. I'm sorry I sold mine..."
5,So many twists and turns!,"This set is AWESOME! I had forgotten how many overlapping and tied-in plots there were! If you liked Soap when it originally aired, you'll love seeing it again. Chuck and Bob ROCK!!!"
3,Worked into a Lather!,"SOAP, the series, is truly a stroll down memory lane for me. It's full of laughs and wacky characters. So this purchase for me was absolutely a long awaited, and much appreciated, addition to my collection.HOWEVER, the packaging was absolutley horrendous!!! They stacked all 6 discs one top the other, with no protectors, or sleeves of any kind to prevent dust or debris from getting in between them and damaging the discs. I was OUTRAGED at the SLOPPY packaging of a classic series collection. Just shoddy cardboard workmanship on the packaging all the way around. Hopefully this would not be the case, for future product releases of SOAP.We DID play all of the discs and they were in very good condition, but we IMMEDIATELY went out and purchased a disc binder with protective sleeves to preserve them.Hopefully, you'll have a good idea of what to expect with the purchase of this set. Good Luck! :)"
3,Soap,I thought some of the episodes were a bit too risque. I forgot that Soap had been controversial. Amazon does a good job when it comes to supplying products requested.
4,Good Clean Fun,It was fun to watch this entertaining parody on soap operas...I'll watch it again in a few years. Hated when the end came....I wanted to see much more!
1,Last disc missing,"I enjoyed the show until I discovered the last disc was missing. Buy it new, not used, for this reason."
1,Doesn't play on a computer. New copy protected discs won't play on a computer. Do not buy.,I bought this and the return window is expired. It won't play on computers due to a new type of copy protection. I don't have a DVD player.
2,Never got this..,I have never gotten my order with this. I should have gotten it on the 3rd of August. I know that things get lost. But I wanted mit and now it is lost forever.If it was insured I am sure I could get my money back or at least a credit.
1,A dummy had to have written this.,"I know very little about horses but apparently I know more than the person who wrote this book. I bought this book to catch up with my wife's riding skills. What a joke. Do not even waste your time or money on this book. Purchase a book from Linda Tellington Jones or John Lyons instead if you really want to learn and understand what you are reading, and be able to apply it to your horse(s) later on."
2,Soap doesn't dispense!?!?,"I bought these as replacements for my wand that came with the blue/green heads (the green part at the end was a tougher scrubbing sponge). I didn't want to buy the blue/green ones anymore because the green part would fall off quickly (it was just glued onto the blue section) and then I'd have to throw it away and start with a whole new head. I thought these would be the perfect solution since the blue sponge material has no seam and would not fall apart. The problem is, there is some design flaw with these because after several weeks of use, they still will not dispense the soap that is in the wand. I've tried loosening or tightening the head. I've also tried several of the heads (I mistakenly purchased 4 packs at one time). At the end of the day these were a waste of money and I guess I will go back to buying the blue/green ones even though every 2 weeks or so the green part falls apart and I have to use a new head."
4,I recommend these.,"I have been using these dish wands for years and really like them because you don't have to get your hands wet and they clean all sorts of dishes, including glassware, very well. They don't splash water all over the place like a brush. I recommend these over the ones with the green top because the green tops separate from the rest of the sponge."
5,the best,One of the best cds I own. The more you listen to this the better it will get. This music hurts me a little. It has a wistful tone. Buy it and you will see.
5,Sharon Kerry from the Godsquad UK,"Every home should have one! Love makes the world go round on the wings of music... This cd was lost in transit from Washington DC to London, England. I was without it for several months until I found Amazon.com upon it's arrival I began to cry. My music library ranges from Classical to Hip Hop and yet I can still say my most pleasurable and mostly listened to CD is 'Link' by Oystein Savag... It's Magical... Thank you Mr. Savag and thank you God for the gift of his music."
4,A classic new age title...,"This album has a blend of different ethno-culture music that is delicately rounded out by Oystein and Lakki in such a beautiful fashion that it should be a staple in every instrumental music lover's collection.""There's a monk in my garden"" boasts some of the tastiest sax line from Bendik Hofseth that i have ever heard. ""Afrikan Flower"" will sweep you away to a dreamy island paradise with it's smooth calypso influence. But my absolute favorite is ""My Heart"" Oystein's signature lush keyboard sound and Lakki's beautiful guitar is moving and heartfelt.Oystein fans have to have this."
1,Out of Date,"Not happy with this item. Came with writing on the packaging saying ""Beth's Printer"" Also Manufactur date was January 2009 (3 Years old)"
5,excellent book!!!,"This is one of the most riviting books i have ever read. I hope one day we will find out who she really is. That vermine should be made to tell everything before he fries!! If your looking to read a really well written true crime, This is it."
5,I finnished the book in one day.,This book was so sad. People aren't meant to live their lives out in torture and fear. Sharon was obviously brainwashed by her capture and probably thought that's how life was suppose to be. I just wish so much she could have gotten away from him. She would have definitely thrived and been a happy healthy woman if she could have gotten away. I don't blame the system in this case for not catching onto the situation when Sharon was a minor. Unfortunately Sharron's persona and intelligence made it very difficult for those around her to recognize the truth.
1,Compelling story; awful book,"This book is very poorly written, and contains numerous factual errors, according to individuals with firsthand knowledge of some of the information purported in the book. I found myself shocked that a ""journalist"" did not give attribution throughout the book regarding his sources, and apparently did not do much fact checking.It is true that the story is compelling and horrifying, no question. It is a shame that the story was not written better or told more accurately.By the way, per the title: where is the hope or enduring human spirit in this tale? Sharon was a stripper and a prostitute and ended up dead at an early age."
5,The definitive street map and index for the city of Paris,"Michelin travel guides have an excellent and well-deserved reputation, and this little blue street map and index for the city of Paris is in keeping with that reputation. It is arguably the most readable, comprehensive, and complete street map and index for the city in print. This is an essential little book if you plan to spend a lot of time walking around Paris, for business or pleasure."
4,Wanted more of some and less of other songs,"I love Ray Lynch - his work is awesome. I was looking for particular songs and sounds and this album was not the best choice for me. I listed to some of the clips and thought it would be spot on for my class, but there were some songs that I needed to de-select for my purposes. He is a genius - just not for my needs this time."
3,Pretty good......for late night listening,"This one is not as good as some of the others...I prefer to hear ""NO BLUE THING""...much more exciting!However, this CD will help put you to sleep and is rather easy to listen too..."
5,Best ambient album of the 80s (has it been that long?!),"I believe I was 11 when I first encountered the Tibetan bells, soothing synths and gentle plucking that evoked within me a sense of misty valleys and mountain tops covered in clouds at sunset. I had no interest at the time in the background of the album, Lynch's spiritual quest and whatnot, but it certainly is no surprise upon reflection. This is soothing music at its best and you will feel the sound of stillness. I can't say I am fan of most of his music, but this stands out in my mind as one of the best ambient albums of the 80s.You may also find Explosions in the Sky to be of similar mood, with the exception being that most of their tunes have a midpoint crescendo that can, in my opinion, ruin what I find most moving about their music. But you should at least give them a try, such asEarth Is Not a Cold Dead Place."
4,Good value for money!,"This book offers a stimulating introduction to astronomy for beginners. The sixth edition is updated with latest research into black holes, active galaxies and quasars, searches for life in space, origin and structure of our universe. I particularly like the many photos and diagrams included in the book for illustration and that each chapter is organized into small sections for easy learning."
3,Astronomy: A self teaching guide,"I have always been fascinated with astronomy but the language/references have been a bit over my head sometimes. I am looking forward to becoming a more savvy ""star gazer"". The book seems to be what I have been looking for."
2,"good introduction, but....","This book is a good introduction to astronomy, but, they put the answers for all the tests right next to (and often directly underneath) the questions. That makes it very hard to take the tests sincerely because it's so easy to accidentally glance at the answers."
5,Great for working out,Great for powerlifters!Want to get pumped before a big deadlift?Crack one or two of these babies under your nostrils and take a deep breath. You'll feel like ripping off car doors!
5,Ammonia Inhalant perfect for the impending Apocalypse!,"I don't think I need to say this, but ""would you really care about aggravating your asthma when you are knocked unconscious by a metal staircase as you are trying to escape a horde of zombies hell bent on tearing your flesh from your bones?"" Me neither. On top of slapping a couple packs of these in your zombie survival kit, they have some more practical purposes as well. You can use them to wake someone who just fainted (i.e. your girlfriend/wife when they realize you just spent $2,000 on a new 3d tv), substitute for a cup of joe (coffee) in the morning, get into a territory marking contest with a male cat (they smell like cat spray), or you could use them for what I have been mostly sniffing on them for (to keep my edge as I pop a cap in a noob on MW3). Whatever you choose to use them for just make sure you wear protection."
4,cool to have,"i saw them on in the movies, and i thought i should have some of these since i am a doomsday preparer. they are as they were promised. i am pleased."
1,Not recommended by doctors and EMTs,"Before purchasing or using ammonia inhalants, please do some research. I saw these in a first aid kit and got curious about how and when it would be appropriate to use them. I couldn't find a single professional doctor or medic that recommended keeping them in a first aid kit. Since Amazon won't let me include a link in a review, here's a summary of what I found:Ammonia inhalants can do more harm than good. Simply being unconscious is a symptom of something else and not a condition that it is generally necessary to treat. Ammonia inhalants can seriously aggravate respiratory conditions (e.g. asthma, COPD) or the person you're administering them to could hurt themself when waking abruptly."
2,Lacks focus!,I went ahead to buy this book even though it has some substandard reviews simply because I wasnt looking for an overly complicated academic text on pricing. I graduated with a degree in economics and even though I dont consider myself a hard core economist I really felt that this text was bare bones. The first 4 chapters go on and on about what devising strategy entails and Engelson uses such 'dumbed' down english; its almost insulting to anyone in business. The examples are too brief and lack analytical rigor.Some templates and graphs in chapter 5 were useful but whats up with a section on famous quotes? Seems like Engelson ran out of things to add to his book. This book is so short you can read it in one hour...dont waste 30 bucks on this one...go with KOTLER or Nagle
4,Pricing Crystall Ball Simplified,"Was my price demand curve justifiable, could I defend it. What about my 3 year forecast to manufacturing, to aggressive, to weak? My job as Product Marketing Manager was to develope a pricing strategy based on sound principles that would determine if the proposed new product would likely meet division objectives for profit and market share growth. My research for helpful books lead me to Morris Engelson's book on Pricing Strategy, the chapter dealing with demand curves for example gave me the foundation from which to build, not just hope. This book can help any product marketing manager (new or old) develope a realistic pricing strategy based on sound principles, not wishful thinking."
2,Not much useful information,"This was a required textbook for a class. The author is very wordy, does not explain well, but enjoys telling ""stories."" The graphs he uses do not match what he is talking about. At times it was a mystery what he was plotting on the graphs or demonstrating in his charts. This is not even good for a reference book. It has already been thrown out for the textbook requirements for my course. A waste of money."
3,So-so replacement,"Ordered this after having the original mirror broken off of my '97 ranger. It was easy to install and looks fine. The edges of the mirror are warped, causing about 1/2"" of distortion around the entire mirror.It's better than no mirror, but not nearly as good as the factory unit."
2,Valves leak,"I bought this kit for the valves. I needed some valves to regulate pressure from a DIY CO2 reactor for a planted freshwater tank. I had a similar plastic air valve that worked in this application just fine. However, the valves in this kit are not the same quality. They cannot hold any amount of air pressure without leaking. Keep in mind that DIY CO2 reactors don't create a lot of pressure. Yet these valves could not handle it. As soon as I connected one, CO2 and water immediately sprayed out from the valve knob.If you just want to control the amount of bubbles created from an air pump, they should work okay."
1,"Cheap, leaky","Cheaply made product, very easy to strip the threads on airflow adjustment knob. Overall, not too impressed with the quality of items from this manufacturer. (15 years, experienced hobbyist) It will get the job done, but there are many more inexpensive alternatives that will yield far greater results."
3,I sure miss the old handle,"This handle fits and works alright, and it was cheap. Unfortunately, it is not nearly of the quality of the original handle. I sure wish I hadn't leaned on that handle as hard as I did. This new handle is not only the wrong color (the original was red and silver) but the ferrule fits kind of poorly and the handle is just a touch loose. One of my clients has a Seymour fork of the same model as mine and he also had to replace the handle with the Link (You can't get the original style handle from Seymour) and his handle is just like mine, which is to say, it's OK, I guess."
5,Ultimate Cooking,"Bitchin' in the Kitchen is not just hilariously PMS, but an excellent cookbook well worth using! It's a MUST HAVE for anyone who entertains or craves food."
2,Earrings,"14K Gold Dangling Spiral Threader EarringsWhere are the earrings?I've payed them but I never got them!!!They were an gift for xmas, for our grandma!!I want this earrings!!!OR you must booked back on our credit card.I find it not good, because I bought them, the shipping would be at the 4.12.07, and they never arrived!!Claudia Schunk"
2,Noisy!,"We bought this sleeping bag when our daughter was two for overnight travel. She loved Dora at the time and it seemed very convenient. The first night she slept on it we didn't get any sleep. Every time she moved it made a very loud sound, almost like the squeaking a balloon makes when it's rubbed. The idea is great but the noise isn't worth it."
4,Extreme Isolation Headphones,"I bought the headphones to use in a noisy office environment. They work great. They are big and clunky, I look like I'm an airplane pilot from the 1960's when I wear them. Also, I have to tuck my earrings inside of them. But they work great at minimizing noisy distractions."
2,Was awesome... now they make REALLY crappy headsets,"Unfortunately, it seems they have lost A LOT of the quality to cut costs....I bought a pair about 5-6 years ago, and it was SPECTACULAR!! A little tight on the head, but the noise isolation is incredible, sound quality is excellent, and I still use them today and love them...... then, I bought 3 for my daughters a couple years ago for plane and car trips. The new ones are a COMPLETE waste of money. They let in a lot more sound. They do not cover the ears well... letting in basically ALL the sound if you turn your head a tiny bit.Very disappointed... it seems they are trying to improve profits and, in the process, turns an amazing headset into something almost worthless..."
1,over-hyped and poorly made for cost,"they do a good job with sound isolation. i think they sound better than the vic firth isolation headphones, more lower end. they, however, are poorly made. not only did they fall apart easily (having to interrupt recording to snap back together frequently) all three that i purchased broke within a month or so. i took good care of them, basically taking them on and off was too stressful for the fragile things. definitely not worth the price. i feel there is some sort of conspiracy because i dont understand how anyone could rate them good. i have a small studio, so the headphones have been on a variety of heads. the general opinion is that they dont fit too well."
3,"Poor build quality, good noise isolarion, good sound","I bought this on Feb 24th. I used it for the first time on a 5 hour bus ride yesterday (March 8th), then the whole day today at work (March 9th). At about 17:00 today, while I was putting them on my head, the bridge broke and the left earmuff remained in my hand :)))). The bridge is all plastic, including the inside moving part.Other than that, they were comfortable, the noise isolation was great for me in my office environment, and the sound quality was good.Will try and return them now, hope a replacement will last longer than 2 days ;)"
2,These are quite overrated,I owned these for one month and they broke in half when I put them on the other day. I couldn't believe that a $120 pair of headphones would do that. Thank goodness for Amazon's outstanding return policy. Upon close inspection I discovered they are constructed entirely of plastic and so I'm not surprised that they broke. Sound quality was decent but I'm not sure why these are so highly rated. Way overpriced in my opinion given the build quality. I will be looking elsewhere after I get my refund.
2,Product quality has diminished significantly,"I have a pair of extreme isolation headphones from several years ago (when they first came out), They don't have a model number or anything and I have been extremely happy with them. I was browsing the Direct Sound website and saw the new model numbers (eg EX-29) and assumed the new generation of products was improved. I just received my new EX-29 today. The first thing I did was plug in my old version to compare. When I plugged in the new EX-29, I was totally shocked. There was significantly more outside noise getting through and the sound was lower quality. There was not a slight difference, but a MAJOR one. I am super dissatisfied with the product and can't even return it because they charge a 25% restocking fee. Beware!"
1,Not much good to say.,"The head band on these snapped in half the first time we used them. I wrote for replacement parts several times, and nobody responded.I then bought a competitive brand of isolation headphones at Guitar Center, and they were less expensive, and much higher quality."
2,Lasted 3 months,"I wanted a pair of cans that could do a reasonable job of reproducing the low tones my v-drums create. These did the best job among a variety of mid price competitors, however the build quality was just not there, and this led to their demise. The cables are thin and not as well secured as they should be. Moderate tugs created a lose connection. Finally the plastic swivel grip that secures the ear piece broke on one side rendering the pair useless.All-in-all I am disappointed with this purchase."
1,Badly constructed. Don't buy.,"I needed a headset for the studio that would keep all outside sounds to a minimum. These phones do that. But they're also poorly made. Before I purchased them, I read reviews saying that the bridge breaks easily. I thought that perhaps those buyers had mishandled the phones. But then it happened to me tonight while working in the studio. The singer took them off and .... 'snap'. Useless. Can't believe it. It's a bit past my return window so I'm hoping the seller will give me a refund. I know it's hard to find a set of headphones that really keep out the ambient noise - but don't bother. These suck."
2,"Music is good, isolation not so much","These headphones don't last very long. The foam around the ears tapers down and harden over time, meaning your ears won't be fully covered fully any longer after 2 months. The sound is good but the isolation leaves much to desire. I have cheaper earphones which block sound better than these and they cost me only 30$. The sound is better in any other headphone designed to listen to music... Anyhow, pretty cheaply built, I don't recommend. Type ""earmuff"" in amazon if you want to find something better to cut sound and listen to music."
5,Extreme Isolation = Heaven in a Cubicle,I bought these to help me drown out noise of co-workers in a very open cubicle area. These are the best!
1,poor quality,"When I opened the box, note that a headset was loose. The reason is that the plastic base is broken. very poor quality product for the price."
1,"Horrible ""isolation""",I tried them as noise isolation. ABSOLUTELY NO ISOLATION! I could hear everything around me! Besides the product's material and implementation are cheap.I DON'T recommend this product to anyone.
1,cheap plastic,"The sound quality is fine. But the arms are made of cheap plastic and can be broken easily. You have to use it like a fragile glass or you want to hold it with your hands after you accidentally broken the arms. I really disappointed and surprised by the weakness of the arms, considering this is an $99 item."
1,"Buy, but only if you need firewood.","I really should have read the reviews before I wasted a cent on this spoon. I hand washed it because I wanted to keep it in great shape. It wasn't many months after I bought it, that it split down the middle. I thought it was made of one piece of wood, and maybe so, but nevertheless, it split. It went into my pile of wood for my firepit. I honestly went to the Goodwill store and came across one of the old, solid wooden spoons and bought one for 25 cents that surely will far surpass the life of this junk. OXO, how could you have failed so badly on this one???"
5,Great spoon.,"Solid, durable spoon made from one piece of wood. I use mine often and have had no problems. I will certainly be using this product as part of housewarming gifts in the future."
1,Didn't last long...,"Unfortunately my spoon broke along the glue line the second or third time I used it. I love OXO products, but was frustrated with this one and don't feel I have any recourse."
3,still have it,"We've had it for about 3 years with no problems. However, it does not tend to get as much use as our other wooden spoons."
4,If you want a heavy duty spoon,"this is the one. Acually it is almost too heavy and bulky for my needs. However, if you want to mix something like bread dough and don't want to worry about breaking the handle, this is your spoon."
3,Oxo Good Grips Large Wooden Spoon,"I ordered several Oxo wooden spoons, somehow thinking they were made in the USA.They arrived today, and I was disappointed to see the 'Made in China' label on them.Had I known this, I wouldn't have ordered them. They look OK, I'll see how well they last."
4,Good story with likeable characters,"On the better end of the traditional Regency spectrum. Ross is a great H who lacks pretentious lordly airs, but carries a natural nobility and commanding presence following his many years in military service. He's also not afraid to go after what he wants, and his pursuit of the seemingly reluctant (but secretly delighted) Addie is enjoyable. The romance plot is set against a historically stretched recall vote of Wellington, for which Ross (newly and reluctantly named viscount following his uncle's death) is groomed by Addie to be a gentleman in order to take up the cause of promoting the need to keep Wellington in the war on the Continent. Minus points for some really sloppy editing mistakes, e.g. ""his head titled"" instead of ""tilted"" and ""in are morning gowns"" instead of ""our.""P.S. Carolyn Madison is a pseudonym for Joan Overfield, who wrote a number of traditional Regencies under that name."
5,Excellent CD.,"Continuing in the beautiful series of Winter's Solstice music, this CD contains traditional and non-traditional Christmas music. However, it should be played year around for its soothing and beautiful sounds."
3,Very monotonous music,"OK, but very monotonous CD. It drives me nuts after a while. OK for background music but too much of the same thing."
5,"Nice balance of seasonal music,plus Tim Story's masterpiece.","It seems as though one cannot go wrong in the purchase of any of the Windham Hill's Winter Solstice series. What makes this CD special is the inclusion of Tim Story's best work: Asleep The Snow Came Flying. Imagine yourself curled up with a good book in front of a roaring fireplace, while outside your isolated mountain cabin, thick snowflakes gently paint the surrounding valley in a soft shade of ivory. This sentimental yet peaceful musical portrait is unforgetable, and a must have for Tim Story fans."
5,Rachel and Natasha are the greatest!!!!,"""The Stanislaski Sisters"" were wonderful stories. In ""Taming Natasha"", ""Tash"" falls for Spencer Kimball, a music teacher. Natasha was stubborn and snippy with Spence, but after taking his class, she decides there's more to him than she first thought. This one is my favorite of the two. In ""Falling For Rachel"", Rachel is the public defender for Nick LeBeck, an out-of-control teen with an older brother named Zack Muldoon. Nick falls for Rachel, and Rachel falls for Zack. Great ending to this story!!!! I can hardly wait to read ""Waiting For Nick""!"
3,Condition of Book not accurate,"book was listed as ""used"" but was in much worse shape than other books I have received. Description should have been ""REALLY used"""
3,my review,"In this book, the author continues the saga of the Stanislaski family. This time, it is the turn of both sister, Natasha and Rachel, to find love and marry.As is her usual style, both stories are very entertaining and the characters seem very alive. I am certainly looking forward to reading the sequels!Good and entertaining read!"
2,Buyer Beware!,"This DVD has nice audio and video quality (no bonus features), but in reality, it is a DVD-r! In essence, a home made release, not professionally mass produced. The artwork for the cover insert is awful, no doubt made on a home computer and printed out with a bad printer. No inlay card. The DVD is obviously home burned as well. So if you missed the ""official"" VHS/laser disc release of Mr. C's last performance in 1994, this might be worth getting. But $19.98 is a lot to pay for what appears to be a bootleg release."
2,WHAT A WASTE,"I give the DVD 2 stars for dear old Perry`s sake. What a shame this was the last Christmas concert and such bad quality. The cover puts you off even before you play the disc. I have to say Perry`s voice held up very well during the recording considering his age one or two slips but lets face it he even made mistakes on his TV shows years earlier this was part of his charm..I remember with great affection when his shows were first shown over here in the UK on the BBC. It was also the first chance to see some of our rock n roll idols who guested with him. All the singles come to mind Moontalk, Kewpie Doll, Delaware Ect. One of the highlights of our Christmas viewing was his show and wondering where it would be coming from. It was the same with Andy Williams. I don`t care if they are in B/W lets have a release of something decent. And also a DVD release of ""Words and Music"" starring Perry along side Mickey Rooney and Tom Drake."
5,2 songs,There are 2 songs that bring a tear. Oh holy night and you are my hero. This needs to be on Bluray
1,Perry Como Christmas in Ireland,"I never received this product. What I did receive was a movie called ""Mr. Johnson"" although the box and label on the DVD were correct. Bad, Bad, Bad....thank you"
5,I'm happy,"I ordered this dimmer for a floor lamp in my college dorm room. Let me address an issue that one person brought up about ease of adjustment. The statement was something along the lines of 'it won't adjust smoothly except for the top half of the brightness scale.' Let me inform you. A standard light bulb uses a filament that has a certain amount of resistance, which varies with heat. A cold filament has a higher resistance than a hot one, so more current is required to reach the critical point where the bulb actually begins to glow. Once the bulb begins glowing (once there is heat being emitted), the resistance lowers, which means that less current is required to make the bulb glow, which means that you can lessen the current to make the bulb extremely dim, but still stay on. Thank you for reading my lengthy science for dummies speech."
5,Works Perfect and Half the Price You Pay at Lowe's or Home Depot,These are the most handy things you can own in your home.What else can I say. They are perfect and the price is awesome!!MUST HAVE to dim those annoying lights that are just too right.Perfect for the bedside lamp so you don't even have to roll and reach up and turn on the light.Just slide the easy switch without hardly moving!LOVE THEM!!
5,Bob's Your Uncle,"Works great. I bought this to use as a dimmer for my RV patio lights and it works perfect. The light can be bright when needed, and dimmer when the evening gets a little longer. I have not checked to see if this works in inclement weather, but then again I don't think it's a good idea to muss around with 110v electricity when it's raining, right?"
5,Easy Dimming of the Bedside Lamp,"My mother is 88 years old and has many health issues, arthritis of the hands being one. She can finally read in bed at night because of this easy to use ""lamp dimmer"". Hurrah!On the other end of the age scale our three year old grandson also can ""read"" in bed at night with the same dimmer!"
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this product on April 18, 2012. Literally, on July 18, 2012, the thing started acting up wherein the light will not come back on when you slide it ""on"". If you fiddle with it enough, it will. NOT GOOD. This did not get use by anyone but me (bedside) and was used only once nightly since purchase. The last one I had lasted almost 7 years and only broke because it fell off the nightstand. I do not recommend!!"
2,SHORT LIFE,"USED PRODUCT BFOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS, AND IT STOPPED WORKING. I COULD NOT TURN THE LIGHT ON. IT WAS GREAT WHILE IT WORKED, BUT THREE MONTHS IS TOO SHORT OF LIFE SPAN."
1,it turns off by itself,"I got a lamp dimmer from Ikea and have been using it about 2 years and it work great, so I ordered 3 Lutron dimmer and hoped they would work the same just like the one I have, but no. It is more expensive than Ikea and does not have the same future like Ikea. I know is not fair to compare this 2 products, but.... Anyway, here are the reasons about What I like Ikea dimmer: 1.when switch to the lower power/light, it NEVER turn off by itself. 2. the adjustable switch button is rubber material that make it easier to use only one finger to move the button. However, I will not recommend to buy Lutron dimmer, only if you cannot find the IKEA dimmer. Ps, Ikea dimmer has indicator light. ( I got both with and without light indicator from Lutron, and I don't like either one)"
4,"Wonderful for ""mood"" lighting","This plug in dimmer is really useful for standard lamps/bedside/spot lighting for all of the ""moveable"" lighting you have. I shopped locally and couldn't find it - some stores/people didn't even know what I was looking for. According to these professionals, it ""used"" to be available!"
5,Light go up Light go down,Works just fine allowing me to adjust the light level over my work space as the ambient light from the window changes with time of day and/or weather.
1,Died after 1 use,This dimmer emitted a burning like odor after 15 mins and then died for good. I think my pre-lit christmas tree takes more power than this dimmer can handle.
5,Goes great with a Lava Lamp,"I just ordered three more of these - I'd given my neice and nephew Lava Lamps as I'd been enjoying mine so much, but I wanted to give them these to go with the lamps, as if you've ever seen a Lava Lamp that's been on for a while - it gets hot and all the 'goo' floats to the top. However, with the dimmer switches, you plug the Lava Lamp into one of these, then you can control how hot the lamp gets. The sweet spot is just hot enough for a single glob to float right in the middle of the lamp - ahh, serenity...Amazon sells the Lava Lamps, too...with free shipping on an 'over $25 total' order."
2,I hate it when I get defective crap from an Amazon supplier,"I know this is a product that works, because I already had one that I've used for years. Unfortunately the one I got from this vendor was a piece of crap and I'm pretty sure they knew it. The package looked like it had been resealed, and when I plugged it in and turned it on, it buzzed. I tried a different lamp just to make sure it wasn't the lamp. It works and I only need it for short periods in the area I'm using it, but it pisses me off when a distributor repackages crap and pawns it off on the next customer hoping it will be someone like me that won't return it, because it's not worth ten dollars worth of hassle."
4,It dims,"We use this dimmer on a floor lamp in the baby room. It does what it is supposed to do- dim. The slider control is very sensitive and the lamp flickers sometimes, but this might be the lamp and not the dimmer switch. I wish it were a bit easier to adjust. The switch lies on the floor but I have to pick it up to adjust it."
5,Great littel gadget!,"A perfect gadget....sets table lamps to mood lighting to task lighting with no fuss.Would like to see a design with a new flat wall hugging recepticle to tuck behind a cabinet better. Other than that, perfect!"
4,Works great with incandescent / halogen lamps; not for motorized appliances!,"This product comes up in certain searches for speed controllers for massage devices, but this is wrong. The manufacturer instructions clearly state:""CAUTION: To avoid overheating and possible damage to other equipment, do not use to control receptacles, fluorescent lighting fixtures, motor-operated appliances, or transformer-supplied appliances.""It should not be used with massagers, but I'm happy with it in conjunction with my halogen torchiere."
2,Works very well,"This is a very nice dimmer -- we use it to control a hanging lamp in our dining room. The design on this one is great, in that the female plug is on the outlet, and the control is used as a ""remote"". Easy and cheap!UPDATE: Less than a year later, it's stopped dimming, and did so with very little use -- we adjusted it maybe once or twice a week. I'd probably look somewhere else for a dimmer next time, although I still like the design."
4,"Good dimmer, but not good for wand-control","I got this dimmer based on other reviews w/ it working well for wand control. I didn't find it helpful for that. It seems to take away power (it doesn't seem able to use full-power even when you have the dimmer all the way up), so I won't keep it for using w/ wand, but for $10 I think I may keep it to use w/ some lamps. ;-)"
2,died after a year,This item stopped working after a year of use for no apparent reason the worst part is that i hardly even used it much.
1,Annoying noise.,"I bought this to use as a dimmer for my salt light. It is just a little too bright at night. Other purchasers complained about the noise the dimmer made, but said that it shouldn't be an issue for lower wattage bulbs. I used this dimmer with a 5 Watt bulb. That's 5 Watts. There are not many bulbs with lower wattage. The dimmer still makes an annoying high pitch whine, which makes it totally unusable as a dimmer switch. Do not buy this product unless you enjoy high pitched whining noises."
4,easy,very easy to use. i use it with my yogurmet yogurt maker to make 30 hr SCD yogurt and it helps to keep the temp between 100 and 105 for the whole time.
4,Good buy,"This is a great price for an item that works just as it describes. I used it on standard Christmas lights, and it works great. They can dim all the way down to the point where there is just a dull glow of the filament. The only issue it has is when you move the dim bar from off to on, it doesn't turn the light on until a certain level has been reached. After that you can dim it wherever you want, but it just won't turn on to anything lower than a certain point until it has reached that point initially. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who needs to dim some lighting though."
5,Perfect Combo!,I needed an extension switch / dimmer for a lamp. I plugged the lamp into this dimmer and the coord was long enough to maneuver the dimmer anywhere I needed. This is exactly what I needed. The coord is long and the dimmer works perfectly. I highly recommend it.
3,"A few glitches, but I'd buy it again.","I use this all day, on and off, in my baby's nursery. The only issue I have is if you dim your lamp too low, it can shut off completely later on. Overall, I'd still buy the product again!"
5,i can't believe it exist!,i needed to buy this lamp dimmer after my first baby was born. use this a lot for midnight feedings and diaper changing. a must have for new parents.
5,great product!,I bought these dimmers because our bedside lamps have hard to reach on/off switches. These are perfect.
3,"Some good, some bad","I watched most of Canadian Idol, and my first impression was that it was much worse than AI. That's still my impression but this CD is not all bad. I like Ryan and Tyler on this CD but I think that Gary, Jenny and Richie are pretty horrible. Those were also the ones that I didn't like on the show. I have to skip alot of the songs on this CD. Could have been worse though."
5,"Billy,Ryan and Karen Lee are the best",This is a great cd. most of the songs are great and especially Billy Klippert. his version of Superstar is unreal and his song is worth the money alone. I cant wait for this guy to come out with an album of his own. he didnt win the competition but he should have.
5,Klippert's the Superstar,"This cd is worth every penny for Billy Klippert's track alone. His version of Superstar truly rocks, it's becoming apparent who the star of Canadian Idol is. The other tracks that stand out on the cd are by Ryan Malcolm and Tyler Hamilton. If you love the show, this cd is a must have."
3,GOOD SOUNDS/BAD SOUNDS,"I and not a great fan of many of these singers. I thought Toya Alexis was hands down the best on the CD. However, I did like Ryan as well. But I don't think the CD is worth the price. I will reserve my cash until a better CD from these Idols and/or the price of this album comes down."
1,Oh please!,Now here's a show to further add to our embarrassment of a country. Ryan Malcolm looks more like a McDonald's manager than a superstar singer. The talent on this show doesn't even compare to American Idol or even Pop Idol.
3,Anastasi's Pachelbel Canon with Ocean Sounds,There was not enough of the ocean sounds in the background although the Canon was beautiful orchestrated. I had previously owned a taped that was perfect blend of waves and orchestra.
5,calm classroom,I love this CD and it is the 2nd time I bought it. I play it in my special needs classroom. It is calming and the ocean sounds are great with the music.The lack of lyrics it is great for the classroom as they don't need any extra verbal stimulation. My husband and I also use it sometimes tohelp us go to sleep.
3,OK,"As another reviewer mentioned, the ocean is not really loud enough to provide the background that was perhaps intended. Still, a pleasant recording."
3,Too much of a good thing,"I love to listen to Pachelbel's Canon, especially when giving a massage. To hear it once is wonderful, twice is still good, but over and over is too much, almost to the point of being irritating - for me and my client. This is too much of a good thing."
1,US ARMY FLAG,"I have received two Marine Corps Flags (original order and replacement order) rather than the US ARMY FLAG I ORDERED. The vendor has the packaging mislabeled as a US Army Flag, but inside is a Marine Corps Flag. I may be understanding about one ""goof"", but not twice in a three day period!!!"
1,Too Violent,"All these vidoes are too violent. None of them end on a positive note. I was looking for a good kids' movie that focused on the true meaning of christmas. Well, this one it not it. You would think it would stop with the birth of Christ but it ends with killing all the babies. They all go way too far and focus on the violence. My kids don't even want to watch them because of all the violence."
4,New Age meets the Middle East,"First off music reviews is no place for political views as the last reviewer has done. Exotic Middle Eastern textures join modern comtemporary instrumental music. Using synthesizers, samplers and sound effects, his very full bodied sound is much like another artist on this label Ayman. Very much a full bodied soundscape in the vein of David Arkenstone, even David has used the feel of the Middle East as a vehicle. Combing the stunning power of New Age music filled with powerful soundscapes and fiery Arabic percussion help create the sound that is Hisham. A real nice blend of world & New Age music. Fans of Ayman will be right at home here."
3,"Definitely different! A few great tracks, most average.",The Stone and the Rose is one of the best songs I've ever heard. Bought the CD in Sedona and must have listened to that track 50 times while driving back to Scottsdale.
1,Poor information from Amazon,"why would I, or anyone buy a set of recordings when the titles are not even listed?"
4,Nice Gauge,I like the size and white background. This gauge is electrical and works well. I wish Sunpro would make a full sweep version like they do for their mechanical version. I think the full sweep guages are easier to read and look better.
3,Clicked minimal,"This is a great minimal techno album. From the prestigious deleuzian german label Force Inc, Auch gives dance music a turn adding different kinds of noises, glitchs, clicks and cuts. It's an extremely digital production with the much present feel of minimal repetitions of four to the floor kicks. Very recomendable to those who like techno music but are interested in experimentation within the repetition."
3,the rhythmic aspect of music ..............,I seems to me that today's electronica is developing the rhythmic aspect of music only. It is far easier especially with the use of computers than developing the harmolodic side of music. Even this disc is an example of this: the four to the floor beat is maintained though using sounds that are not exactly kick and snare.This kind of music is an example of economy. As i have said it is developing the easier side.I would like to hear someone who develops the harmolodic side of music composition...Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.
4,55 illustrations on 96 pages 7.6 x 4.8 inches,"This small size book is copiously illustrated with 55 extremely high quality photos (most in color) of models, computer generated renderings, schematics (including plans, sections, perspectives, site plans), office at work, graphics, etc. The text is very clear, sharp, and easy to read despite a small print of part of it, and as expected from Birkhauser. From the publishing technical point of view this book is perfect, but its small size is not an advantage. It is a solid review of a character of Eisenman's works on example of some particular ones, or rather of some methods to produce his works. It is not a monographic review of his works, but rather a handbook with snapshots showing some techniques employing computers and models similar to those used by Frank Gehry."
4,"Good story, bad price","Typical Burroghs story. Straightforward, predictable, two dimentional characters, but still alot of fun and an entertaining read.But the price, 19.95? This is in the public domaine. Legally. I don't care to read from the screen and would much rather have a book, I'd pay five dollars. At twenty, I'd just download it."
5,lee rifle charging die,"came in quickly and worked perfect. makes reloading my .308 a lot faster. the description says it will work up to .308, but you can make it work for bigger calibers too. you may just have to charge it twice rather than once."
3,Some Trivia,"Once upon a time I owned the LP version of this release. Prior to its release, Reprise pressed a promo single (Reprise 0842) featuring ""Bluegreens on the Wing"" b/w ""Besides Yourself."" During my short-lived DJ career, I played this on the radio and believe a few others, mostly in California, did, too. Note that there are two versions of ""Bluegreens,"" both good, but the second has a little more produced sound to it. I think that's the version on the album, as well as a re-release of the single. What's sad, though, is that ""Besides Yourself"" remains missing. It's a catchy little electronic, slightly jazzy instrumental. Glad that I still own the 45, but the CD would be a nice addition to a collection if found at an affordable price."
3,Not quite what I expected,"The first time I saw this movie was on HBO years ago. I was disappointed to see that the film on the VHS cassette appeared to have been edited and some of the fleshy parts diminished, not what I would have expected from Playboy. The plot is about a young film director trying to convince his reluctant wife to play a nude scene in his new film to bring in a bigger audience. The usual plot twists and movie cliches, but some beautiful women undressed."
4,New sandals,"I bought these for my husband as his old ones were very worn at the outside corners. The old ones were Nordstrom brand but looked identical to these except they were nubuck leather. My husband said these feel a little tough, the leather is not as soft and pliable as the nubuck leather but they seem to be a good fit and he says with time they will feel softer and more comfortable. Says he's breaking them in."
2,Not a travel guide,"I fully expected to enjoy this book, as I love stories that take place in the southwest and among native americans. Instead, I was bored by the long (and pointless) descriptions of flora and fauna. I love the rugged landscapes of the area, but descriptions were overdone in this book. It felt as much a botany or geology lesson as a novel. I could never bring myself to really care about the characters, and the ending seemed gimicky. I will not be reading the next two installments in the series."
1,No better than the Qt tutorial,"Don't waste your money. This book would be helpful in getting you started using Qt, but the examples and coverage are no better or more complete than the tutorial included with the qt package. This book introduces basic Qt tools, but doesn't give any suggestions for how to use them in actual applications. Even the simple example applications at the trolltech website are more practical than the examples in this book."
5,Don't judge the book by it's cover.,"Before I went out to buy this book, I visited the publisher's and Amazon web sites because I was feeling apprehensive about how trivial a 24 hour Teach Yourself series get. After I had gone through the review, I feel that there is hope in learning C++ GUI development after all. Qt and Daniel, the author give beginners as a programmer a chance to shine. I attempted Visual C++ with a couple of books, and nothing came close to a good concept as portrayed as Qt and Daniel as a wonderful writer. I agree with one of the reviewers before me, there should be a CD consists of Qt GUI tools software bundled with it.I gave it 5 stars because it's easy to follow, which I presume people with some basic C++ programming background would be interested in purchasing this book and this book covers alot. I'm going to look into a more detailed book by the same author which is also on sale and listed on Amazon if I'm not mistaken."
3,No CD-ROM?,"The book is lucid and follows much of the beginner's pages from the trolltech web site. However, it would have been nice to get a cdrom with both book examples and the GNU license-free version of the QT library."
2,For total dummies only,"As the author notices: ""If you're a professional programmer (since you're reading this book I assume you're not..."", this book is for rookies. It might be of some help if you really know nothing about modern programming, but if you do know at least something - don't waist your time and money. You'll find much more useful data online at trolltech site or some other places. In the best ""teach yourself whatever in 24 hours"" traditions, this book barely scratches the surface, living a lot of important information behind. For instance, there is not a single mentioning of events and hooks...:-("
3,Great for beginners and those who can't speak proper english,"This book as mentioned before has many of grammar errors. If you?re from a country other than the USA and cannot speak proper English, this is your Qt book. It is a wonderful book for beginners to get started with. The intermediate and beyond will find this book to be boring, or they will learn one thing from it. It is the only 24-hour book I own."
4,Ty Houston cute dog,"Dog is cute. Has a ""friendly"" face. Little kids will like that. Really anybody could sit and look at it. Kids can pretend its a ""real"" pet. All TY products are pretty sturdy."
5,Awesome!,"I first thought $5 for a spoon??!! But ordered it anyway because it looked good and sturdy. The spoon proved to be worth every penny!!! Its very sturdy and convenient to stir large quantities of food. It works great especially when stirring sticky stuff, since its very strong. I haven't used any other spoon while cooking since I bought this. Highly recommend this."
5,good sturdy spoon,"This is a nice, heavy, spoon - good balance, sturdy and smooth surface. I wash it by hand to avoid excess wear by the dishwasher - I bought an Oxo wooden spatula as well - same good quality."
2,"If it didn't cost so much to ship back, I would","Two good things about this purchase: realatively inexpensive and quick arrival. I should say ""CHEAP"" as well. The cable was WAY TOO SHORT and the ""back"" button doesn't work. Like my review title states, ""If it didn't cost so much to ship back, I would"" do so and ask for a refund. Alas, I will not be purchasing anything more from this supplier."
1,Very disappointing,"I thought I was ordering an XBox controller. Instead I got a controller that was made by Pelican. It does work with the XBox but within two days the protective covering over the drive control had torn and fallen off leaving a very sharop edge that cuts into your thumb. Now have to wear a bandaid over thumb to use control.. Also the drive control has become very loose and we are wondering just how long it will last. If I had known this was not an XBox controller, I probably would have searched further until I found the correct one. This is the first time I hae been disappointed in any product I have ordered from Amazon, I realize this product came from a different supplier but thought since Amazone endorsed it, it would be alright. I probably will continue to order from Amazon, but will be more careful if item is from an outside supplier."
1,Buyer Beware,Buyer Beware. Do you homework. I'm new to the Xbox scene and needed another controller for the 360 i just purchased. What I was unaware of is that the old xbox and the newer 360 have different connections. The older looks more like an S video connector while the new ones more like a usb connector. This must be because this seller says this is an xbox controller...and it sure did NOT fit my 360.
5,Very good controller,"The item arrived very well packaged. Normal shipping time. I tested the controller for the original Xbox, it works very good. I hope that this controller last a long time."
4,controller,"my son says it works good and he is happy with it, he would know more then i do about them. as long as he likes it its all good with me i would buy another one for him.."
4,Quality Product,It is getting harder and harder to find accessories for those of us who cling to our original xbox. I have tried a few of these non-Microsoft brands and they often have parts break within a few uses. I have been playing my usual games on these and they have held up very well. They even feel more sturdy than the other off brands I haver used. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
1,Broke way too quickly,"The flat circular control pad broke (as in the plastic physically broke) within about a month. Even before then, the controls seemed a bit mushy."
3,know what you are ordering!,The controller came as ordered. I did not realize that an XBox 360 cannot use an XBOX controller. My mistake.
3,no extra shoulder buttons,Just bear in mind that there are no extra black and white buttons on the shoulder. It's the same as the normal XBox Controller S
2,Overrated as a locked room,Wildly overrated (#9 in a MWA poll of best locked-room mysteries). Even an average Carr locked room is more satisfying. Content is a bit thin; it would have made a better short story.
5,Happy!!!!,I loved watching this show as a kid and am SO happy to have the whole series. Now I just gotta find some time to sit and watch it all
5,Glad I purchased it!,"What a deal!!! I am so glad I purchased this set and didn't mind the slim packaging. Some comments I read, people bashed it but I would much rather have the savings than all the extra packaging. We have had so much fun watching the old episodes, took me back to my youth! :)"
4,Works with ESXi Vmware 5.x,"Card works very well under Vmware. My only major complaint: this is a ""server adapter"" yet has no 2U bracket. Minus one star far that."
1,Bad Pressing,"WARNING! The currently (Nov. 2011) shipping stock of this audio CD is apparently from a bad pressing. The last several tracks run into the track time of each following track. This means that if you select a single track for play, beginning with track 7 (of 12), the music starts shortly before the end of the preceding track and ends in the middle of the music before that song is finished.That would actually not really matter as long as you listen to the CD in its entirety, except that the very last track simply gets cut off before the end. The end of the last track is not on the CD. It is a very rude and disconcerting end of the CD in the middle of a note. I returned the first CD I received, and the replacement is exactly the same. (And the replacement arrived the day I shipped the return, so I know it was not the same CD.)The music is beautiful, but the bad pressing of the CDs ruins it."
1,Not EXACTLY the same! Bad Fit.,"Ordered 2 cameras recently (me and my mother) and ordered the replacement batteries as well. Both batteries that came in do not fit properly in the Xacti. They are just a hair too thick. If you do manage to push it in, it does work, but getting it out is nearly impossible. I don't recommend taking the chance.Not worth the savings to potentially ruin a great camera."
1,This doesn't fit the Xacti VPC-E2 properly,"This battery doesn't fit properly into my Xacti digital camera/camcorder. Unlike the OEM battery that ships with the camera, this replacement doesn't pop out when the restraining tab is lifted, so you must pry it out (with tweezers/screwdriver/hairpin, etc.) by hand. Although the battery works when installed, the fact that it is such a pain to get out is a real pain."
1,"it fits, it worked, but it won't release because it is larger than Sanyo battery","It fits, it worked, but it won't release for recharge because it is larger than the original Syano Xacti battery. Needed a small screw driver to pry it out. Would not buy it. Would buy the original Sanyo battery."
5,FANTASTIC,"On a scale of 1=10, this rates a 10 plus.The most relaxing music I have ever heard. Absolutely beautiful!"
5,Amazing!,"This is one of the best cds I've ever heard. Every track on it is great. Each song is so full of surprises. I've heard a bunch of other Andreas cds and so far this one is a must get for every human on the planet. I cannot praise this enough. The songs are all in German, which I don't understand a word of, and they're all toe tapping upbeat electronic music with nice mixtures of other types of music. Simply ecstatic! This is a wonderful gift to humankind- seriously. Track it down, you won't regret it."
3,"Good material, but not up the past efforts","This is one of the later Putnam efforts in the larger format.Whether its because of the different format that I don't think works as well as their earlier efforts, a reduction in the number of 3-view drawings, or simply the writing, I didn't like this book as much as the 20+ other Putnam aviation books in my library. Again, as with several of the later Putnam volumes it has plenty of numbers on various aircraft types, but lacks context and service-use details.Overall, it lacks the detail and (dare I say) ""charm"" of the earlier books in the series written by true marque experts, who could make the history of the most esoteric UK aviation firms interesting.Let's hope they return to the old format."
1,Bad ingredients for cats!,"Okay - read the label carefully.Propylene glycol.What is that? Antifreeze!!Propylene glycol and ethylene glycol are both used in antifreeze.It is what you try to AVOID for pets!In humans, it can act as a humectant, and add moisture to an area.Not that I'd want it on me either, but I know enough to not eat moisturizer.But in pets, it can get ingested, and should NOT be used!What this company is doing, I really don't know.But you can bet that I'd never buy this product.It isn't worth possibly giving my pet some sort of poisoning.Even if not fatal, it would have to be painful."
3,Looks Nice but doesn't perform well,"I was happy with the look of this faucet, but question the quality of the construction. The high arc leaves plenty of room to wash hands or perhaps fill a vase with water. I had an experienced plumber install the faucet. As he walked out the door, I turned the water on and noticed the arc actually lifted slightly and lowered when the water was turned off. After a couple weeks, the water flow slowed to half speed at best and when you turn the faucet off, the water still runs out for a couple seconds. I'm confident it was installed properly, this is just not a quality product, certainly not worth the price."
1,Not worth the effort,I spent hours tracking down a replaceable handle for a perfectly usable spade head -- but it broke within hours of starting to work with it. And I am a 64 year old woman of no particular strength!
3,"Good footage, both current and historical; Poor Commentary","Hellcat enthusiast's will sit through the poor narration, which sounds like it is read from a script too fast and without emotion, to gather the technical information and watch some great footage of the Hellcat in action.The restored ""31"" is featured throughout the video often mixed with some excellent original WWII film.First half of the video is presented as a technical walk-around of the aircraft and a short flight.WWII footage is featured in the second half through a short drama, based on a historical event."
1,I'd love it if I could get it to work...,"After several months of contact with Tech Support, I've given up trying to get this to work. I've been able to read email just fine, but sending hasn't worked. Tech support folks promised repeatedly to send me a debugging program so we could identify the problem; unfortunately, they couldn't find a version of the debugging program they could send to me (and I had to keep contacting them to remind them to try). One guy, Alan, was able to send me their new beta versions...unfortunately I couldn't get these to work either...My advice if you buy it...try to get it set up immediately and if it doesn't work, don't count on Tech support to help you out...return it instead. If it does work for you, then congrats..because it looks like a very useful program."
5,Great guide book!!!,"I love the entire Rough Guide series of books! They have great maps, provide detail of all the different eating options, sightseeing options, have phone numbers, hours of operation... just everything you would need in one small book!! I've bought the Rough Guide for several different trips in different locations and always been very pleased! I didn't make it to London on my last trip to Europe but it's in the book case ready for our future trip there!!!"
1,Beyond STUPID!,"I thought this book would be perfect for my stepfather who ""knows all"" and always acts like everyone else is an idiot. So I purchased this book, as well as ""How to Confuse the Idiots in Your Life (Truth about Life)"", for him for Christmas. As soon as they arrived, I looked them over & was horrified by how ridiculously stupid they both were throughout. I couldn't even bring myself to give either to him. Both titles are very misleading; I suggest they to be changed to ""If You're an Idiot & Enjoy Stupid Humor, This Book's For You (1&2)!"" Neither are for intelligent people. Don't get me wrong...I can laugh at slapstick, silly & sometimes even ""potty"" humor, but both books are just plain STUPID."
2,Not What You Think,"When I first read the description of this book, it sounded interesting to a cynic like myself. I was expecting a witty but generally serious book with a real point, and this wasn't. It was mainly just a joke, and not a very good one at that."
1,Inferior product,"This mat is advertised as a ""custom fit"". That is a false description. It is not a ""molded"" fit. It simply fits the area of the shape of the dash. It also did not come with any fastening devices."
1,"Ohmagawd, NO NO NO!","You know, I love A.1 Steak Sauce, and this marinade aint any different than a steak sauce in its consistency, but its NOT a marinade! Real marinades have a high acid content to penetrate the meat, this is a SAUCE. Might taste OK on the finished product, but you cannot marinate pork or chicken with this stuff. Well maybe if you let it soak for a month or two.There arent a lot of good jerk marinades on the market, you're better off making your own."
5,Want to be a Jedi? Here is your instruction manual!,"If you are a Star Wars fan looking for an answer to life's questions, this book is for you. While there is no single answer, this book gives you the right questions to ask on your journey to your own answer. This book is full of essays written by multiple philosophers from multiple perspectives. Excellent work by Abrams and all the others! GREAT , and inexpensive, GIFT for both lovers of philosophy and star wars."
5,"Son of Frost, Siblings of the Force","For those whose Heart burns with the fires of the cosmic energy, and loves Star Wars. This is the book for you."
3,"Good book, unil.......","I found this book to be quite entertaining and a good refresher in the basics of Plato and Aristole's writings. The only problem was the one sided view when you got to the ""environment"" section. The author who wrote this section came across to me as a tree hugging, socialist who would like to see corporation go down. Really a big turn off!!!!! Shame!!! Otherwise, with the exception of this one section, the book was fine. Nothing earth shattering, but neither is the ""Jedi's mythology"". All it is is an amalgomation of already written and explored mythologies with lightsaber fights and spaceships."
4,Philosophy from the Jedi Masters,"Certainly Abrams and the contributing writers are strong in the force. I enjoyed this book. While it may not be very deep for the seasoned philosopher, the book serves as a great intro to philosophy in a unique way. The material is clearly well researched, both from the movie and from the philosophies covered, but written in a way that beginners like myself can understand.A great choice for both Star Wars fans and the padawan philosopher!"
4,Great idea but a bit monolithic,"I give the book high marks for its novel approach to integrating philosophy (so too the series) and popular culture in a creative way. The essays are brief, readable and mostly to the point. Fans of Star Wars, of course, will enjoy it the most. I was a little disappointed by its repetition and lack of deeper penetration. Great emphasis, for example, is place upon Yoda. He is the guru and his line ""Fear leads to anger... hate .... suffering,"" is then a key point in many essays. Less emphasis upon the female voice is found. Padme a little but where is the voice of Lea?? Quite enjoyable but needs greater penetration!"
2,Not Bossa At All,"If you think you will hear anything related to Brazilian music,you will be sadly mistaken. This sound here is slowed down, mellowed out Stones music, an oxymoron."
5,A cathartic experience,This is the ultimate guidebook for those who have lost a preganacy or newborn. It offers many suggestions for rituals and support groups as well as pertinent medical information. I would suggest it to anyone in need.
5,Excellent Book,"This book was a fantastic source of support and guidance for my husband and me. The author uses lots of interview research to come to her conclusions and uses current medical sources. The chapters are topical and provide you with additional resources if you wish to read further or refer you back to a particular chapter review. We both finished this book and were so impressed with the resources in the appendices. I FULLY recommend this book, even if it's been years since your pregnancy loss."
1,Didn't do anything for me,"The book addressed a number of things. The medical part is the big, thorough part of the book, but emotional comfort and help with grief, was third rate. For emotional support, Miscarriage: Women Sharing from the Heart is in a league of its own. I just wasn't seeking medical knowledge. This book is probably pretty good for someone looking for medical information, however."
3,the wood feels yucky,"I bought cheap wooden spoons at target and after washing them once the nice finish on the wood rubbed off & the handles felt disgusting, and rough. i could barely stand to hold them let alone stir cookie dough with them. so i gave them to goodwill & i thought, i won't make that mistake again, i'll go with Oxo this time. but the same thing happened, out of the box they were fine, but the wood felt nasty after they were exposed to water. they weren't soaked or anything, just hand washed in the sink. i know you'll think i just have an aversion to wood but all the wooden spoons i've used before must have been well-loved and worn smooth. i don't know how i can replicate that with brand new spoons. maybe i have to sand them or put some kind of finish on them?"
3,Started Out Great,"I really enjoyed using this spoon for the first 2 weeks or so. Then it cracked and I was very unhappy. It seems so substantial and sturdy. I'm still using it because it's not unuseable yet, but it will get to that point in a few weeks, I bet. Then I'll have to throw it away and start the search for a better spoon."
3,Troys Story,"There was a lot of great background of how Troy Bayliss got into racing but this really stops at 2002. There was really nothing about his 2 years with the Ducati MotoGp team, his year on the Honda MotoGp bike or his return to World Superbike other than a few sentences and images. I would have thought this newer DVD would have more of the recent history as well. This DVD shows what a great competitor and really nice guy Troy is."
3,Troy's Story The Incredible Rise Of Super Sportbike Champion Troy Bayliss,"Although I liked The Doctor,The Tornado and The Kentucky Kid better,That is not to say this isn't worth watching, Troy Bayliss seems like a nice guy and a good racer I am not a big fan nor Much of a Ducati Fan but it is interesting and in depth with interviews with him and his family, His time Riding Kawasaki, Suzuki and Ducati."
3,Truly for Die-Hard Fans Only,"Though I love my motorcycle, I hate television and never watch motorcycle racing. I just don't get it - it's not that exciting. I tried watching this in streaming format and didn't find it compelling - over two hours of slow paced chit chat with Troy, his parents, his sister, his wife... and excessive footage of people walking around, standing in locker rooms, in general not being interesting. Not much of a compelling story line - and a lot of filler. I bet if this was edited down to 60 minutes (leaving out crap about his wedding - seriously???) - it would be more interesting. Someone should've told his dad about sitting like that in front of the camera - ewww. Recommend this only for the most die hard racing/Troy Bayliss fans."
3,Sunlite Black/White 27 X 1-1/4 Tire,Cheap cheap tire. Description should note that it's only 70 psi max. Kind of low for a road bike tire. I chose this because I specifically wanted a white sidewall to go with the color scheme of the bike and there were no other choices. While the white color is a bright white it is speckled with black dots and marks from the black rubber showing through underneath. The width of the whitewall varies quite a bit also.
5,Stories of Half a Century,"Don Zimmer has been active in professional baseball for longer than most of us have been alive. His experiences over these years form a story of how the sport has changed. It's no longer the close knit teams of friends that played ball together for years. It's changed. Now professional baseball is big money, really big money. the free agent system has turned the team into individual players each more concerned with his own contract than the team.Don tells this story of change in a book of anecdotes, laughs, excitement and comedy. Did the sport change for the better? Well, yes and no. Like another book starts out: ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."" But with the season over, it's clearly time to do some reading."
5,For Those Who Hurt,Excellent book for anyone going through a loss or time of grief - from Christian perspective. Beautiful pictures and layout.
1,garbage,this book questions your faith is you hurt. He belives that God sends pain to help us. Pain is a part of this world but it is not the doing of my GOD. Very bad book for someone hurting
5,For Those Who Hurt,"This booklet is a wonderful way to help people struggling with loss of a loved one. I send it with any sympathy card. Chuck Swindoll is a favorite author of mine and how he says these comforting words is very special, as are all of his words of counsel and inspiration."
1,Broke within a month,"Never dropped, didn't get it wet, no thermal shock.... just broke in two inside the oven one day. I had it for less than a month at that time. Very disappointed. Oh well, I have a pizza cutter still, I guess...."
1,TERRIBLE PIZZA STONE.,"I cannot express to you enough how much I hate this pizza stone. I ordered my first one several months ago and was very excited to begin using it. I made sure to preheat the stone for the appropriate 30-40 minutes before using it and took special care to scrape and wipe it off with a dry cloth before storing it away. However, after the 5th time using it, it broke in half completely. I promptly wrote amazon and told them and they very kindly sent me a new one for free (kudos to amazon's customer service) and apologized for the problem. I've since been using my 2nd pizza stone and one of the corners completely broke off after it had cooled. Not sure what I'm going to do to make pizza but I am most definitely not going to buy any other products from this particular company. This is a terrible pizza stone!"
4,Quality,"I bought this Keilen Italian Villa Baking stone for my friend for Christmas. She loves to cook and has fallen in love with the baking stone. Pizzas and bread are cooked evenly. The only small downside is that it can chip very easily. Because of its shape, the corners tend to flake/chip if gently knocked on any surface but other than that,,,couldn't ask for better!"
4,Great for bread,"Great for baking al sorts of artisanal bread as well as pizza, etc. Thick and fairly sturdy. Be careful though, the unglazed ceramic will stain easily."
1,Bad Odor,I ordered this item to use for baking bread but the stone has the oddest smell to it when it's heated in the oven. I have to use parchment paper to assure the smell doesn't seep into my food. Decided a few weeks ago to buy the more expensive one from Pampered Chef since I also have one of theirs and it has no odor at all. Several people have told me to try and return it but the time for that has expired so I thought I'd write a review and maybe prevent others from making the same mistake I did.
4,Pizza or Bread Stone,My husband wanted a pizza stone and I picked this one since I enjoy making homemade bread and I liked the idea that I could use this for both. It does indeed make very good pizzas as well as bread. It's very high quality at a very reasonable price. I was afraid given the price that it would be of a low quality but that's not the case. The pizza cutter however is another story. It's very flimsy and didn't last long before it broke. However that wasn't the reason I purchased the stone so it's not really a big deal. It's well worth it for the stone but just forget about the cutter.
3,"Ok stone, flimsy cutter","This stone, while not the highest quality, works fine. It holds heat well and evenly, but it stains very easily. The pizza cutter is flimsy and won't last long."
2,This book is not written by Aileen,"It seems that the author (and I'm not talking about Aileen here, since she didn't write this book, no matter what Berry-Dee is trying to convince you) has taken lots of newspaper clippings and put this book together in a quick way to make money. Although it's not badly written there is something missing. There is hardly any references to her childhood and very much about her being interviewed. Lots of stuff I believe is taken from Nick Broomfield's Aileen documentaries. It's an ok read and I'm glad I got this one from the library and didn't buy it!"
1,Misleading,"You would be led to believe that this is the secret hide-away book Aileen herself wrote prior to death but NO! It's false advertisment IMO. It's written by Christoher Dee and used Aileen's quote's and interviews to write this book. Aileen herself had nothing to do with it. I recommend Sue Russels ""Lethal Intent"" and Michael Reynolds ""Dead Ends"". Both very informative and interesting books and much better written then Dee's. It seems we all will never really know what Lee's actual life and thoughts were but Lee herself....and since she's dead we will NEVER know."
1,Monster: My True Story,"One would be led to believe that Aileen Wuornos wrote this book prior to her execution, however, it is a book written by Christopher Berry-Dee with some quotes in it by Wuornos.It is a general overview of information already found in Sue Russel's book ""Lethal Intent"" with little new information to add.I felt as if I were rereading most of what I already knew.I would suggest Russel's book instead as it has more detail and is better written."
1,"IF YOU'RE TOO LAZY, HIRE A FACT CHECKER FOR TRUTH","I APPEAR IN THIS BOOK, BUT WHAT IS STATED ABOUT ME IS NOT TRUE; NOR DID THIS WRITER TRY TO VERIFY ANY TRUTH WITH ME.AT FIRST BLUSH, IT ALSO APPEARS THIS WRITER SIMPLY COPIED ""QUOTES"" FROM COURT DOCUMENTS, AND PARROTED ""THOSE"" AS ""AILEEN WUORNOS' WORDS""; AS I SEE STATEMENTS (SUPPOSEDLY OUT OF MS. WURONOS' MOUTH) THAT WERE TAKEN (OUT OF MY MOUTH) FROM MY LEGAL DEPOSITIONS!TOO BAD THERE IS NO LEGAL RAMIFICATION FOR PLAGERISM FROM DEPOSITIONS, OR THIS WRITER WOULD BE OUT OF A JOB. AND, IN MY OPINION, DESERVINGLY SO, AS THE ONLY TRUTH IN THIS BOOK IS THE SPELLING OF THE AILEEN WUORNOS NAME.JACKELYN GIROUX"
3,Fair,I found myself skipping around this book looking for substantial and pertinent information about the workings of this female killer. It was easy to put down and pick up again as compared to another bio which was riveting.
2,Extremely bias and judgemental against Aileen Wuornos,"Not a balanced story of her life. Must be able to overlook the biased commentary to pull the facts out from it. Too much biased commentary, I thought. Like a witch hunt.Does have the call details between her and her ex-girlfriend, where the ex-girlfriend was trying to get Aileen to say something incriminating while being recorded by the police. This was informative."
2,Monster: My true story.,"awful writing, author could have tried a little harder to get this story to flow."
5,Beautiful book,"This is an exceptionally rare concept for an art book, with a single volume devoted to one single painting (or more correctly a painting comprising several panels). There is little text intruding in the way of the artwork, and the full page images are awesome close-ups. The book is packed with full colour quality reproductions. You can clearly see, brushstroke by stroke, how all the fine detail of this masterpiece was executed. I own a large collection of (so far) over 400 books on art and this would rank as one of my favourites"
5,Great Perfume at a good price,"I tried the new In Bloom and then I bought the Rare Pearls in the Shimmering Powder to give it a try. I love it. I just bought the Shower Gel for only $5.00. IMHO the Rare Pearls smells better than the much more expensive In Bloom, and , it lasts longer. I will soon be getting the perfume and the body lotion."
3,Not what I expected,"This only offers a marginal improvement over the factory stock (regular) cabin air filter in my Nissan. It does a decent enough job of keeping out cigarette smoke when I'm unlucky enough to be stuck in traffic next to a smoker, but the smells of nature (including dead skunks) still make it in."
2,"Nice concept, but poor execution","Starts out fairly strong, establishing the two main characters reasonably well, but flounders as the alien lifecraft is explored. Once inside it, the descriptions and action, what little there is of it, are tiringly repititious and uninspired. Loose ends of the story are left untied, and I wound up feeling that my reading time had been a bit wasted. May appeal to some readers, but I cannot honestly recommend it."
2,Great start; sluggish finish,"This is an ""alien object approaches solar system"" story. The begining, involving an accidental collision of a shuttle craft with an earth-orbit space station is quite good. The set-up of the two main characters, Alis and Karl, is done quite well. Things go downhill from there, however. The two are reunited by chance in a survey ship near Pluto, when the alien object comes onto the scene. The plot drags as the team sent to investigate the object stumbles through a series of mishaps. The characters, particularly the supporting cast to the two principals, are petty and peevish. The conclusion is painfully obvious. If you want to read about alien objects, Greg Bear's ""Eon"" or ACC's ""Rendezvous with Rama"" are much more fulfilling."
3,Not as Hard as it looks,"Stith provides a perfect reason to chafe against categories like ""hard"" and ""soft"" SF. While he does a craftsmanlike job of producing an adequately bewildering alien environment, it all seems rather cursory and unengaging. The real reward here is the unusually-developed characters, who interact with a humanity, equally childish and compassionate, that is often lost in more ""ennobled"" works. Giving the book three stars is almost arbitrary. As pure science fiction, it falls flat. As a character study, it just might have something..."
3,A return to childhood.,"I last read this book in my early teens, about 50 years ago. I was surprised how much of the book I remembered. It certainly gives a view of 14th century England that is memorable. It also goes a long way to explaining why the French hate the English.I recommend this book to anyone with children in their early teens who would benefit from an improved vocabulary."
1,Not for larger thighs,"I am a larger thighed girl and have bigger calves so I was hoping from all the reviews that these would work for me. Sadly, they aren't for us midwestern build girls. Great boot but just didn't fit me."
3,Not so bad,although contains important subjects in clinical pharmacology it can not be used as the sole source for the exam. it is organised in topics like pediatric pharmacology. gereiatric pharmacology and so.
1,Not the Best,"This is not the best product OXO has put out. Within minutes of initial use, the sponge separated from the head. Might be good if they fix this but right now, find another scrubber."
1,Piece of junk,"I had the same experience as everyone else. On top of the shredding and eventual separation of the sponge, the twist-on head kept untwisting and coming off. The worst part was when I bought some replacement heads, and accidently bought the OXO Soft Works (as opposed to Good Grips) type. They had apparently fixed that twist-in design flaw, because the head was a slip-on/snap-on type, which of course didn't fit my handle. I can't take them back, because my hands were greasy when I opened the package to take it out.I only bought this because of the anti-bacterial feature and my desire to have a healthy kitchen, but never again - unless they are giving them away for the price they are worth (under a dollar would be about right.)"
1,Broke w/ 1st use,"I bought the OXO good grips scrubber. I used it and w/ in seconds of the 1st use, the head separated from the backing. I couldn't find a replacement head for it at the store and I didn't want to buy 1 in case they are all defective. I made my own sponge head. I bought a 2 sided sponge w/ scouring side. I cut the sponge in a oval and used epoxy to glue the sponge to the plastic,I kept the original plastic back piece, and snapped it on. SO far so good. I reommend that you DO NOT buy this product unless they fix this problem w/ the sponge head."
3,For absolute beginners or those without a lot of time,"Of the many RoR books I've read, this is probably the easiest to follow. If you don't have a lot of time and want to satisfy your RoR curiosity, this is your book. The author doesn't go into great details which can be a great thing if you're a new programmer and just want to get your feet wet. For experienced programmers, I'd go with ""Agile Dev. with Rails"" for a more thorough reading."
1,Outdated,I found it difficult to start coding after reading this book because so much of it is outdated for the newer versions of Ruby on Rails. I have yet to figure out where several of the features described in the book are and am using more online help to code my piece than I have ever had to in the past.
3,This book is not for Ruby on Rails 2.0,"This book was written based on Ruby On Rails v.1. Since the syntax of version 1 and 2 are very different, most of the codes provided in this book will NOT work with version 2 without significant modifications. Unless you want to go with an earlier version, otherwise I don't recommend using this book.If you are not sure which version of your Ruby on Rails is, you can do the following:rails -v"
3,Not for professional developers,"The only reason I'm giving this book 3 stars is the good introduction to Ruby at the beginning. Its coverage of Rails is simplistic. The author asks you to re-run the command to create a new rails project for each example he takes you through. After awhile, this becomes very annoying. How often is a web developer creating new projects? It is better to go through one or two extended examples.If you do some programming for a living, this book is not for you. Get the real thing:Agile Web Development with Rails"
1,fail!!!!,fail!!!very disappointing!!!!i installed the latest version of ruby / rails and running the first greeting app threw several exceptionsthanks to stackoverflow i managed to figure-out what was wrongi guess the sample code works with the older versionsbut if you're planning on running the latest version of ruby / rails then be prepared to dig through the exceptions
1,Do not buy this book unless you want a history lesson,The information in this book is outdated and is not compatible with Rails 3. Nice history lesson that is about it. Amazon should be ashamed for selling outdated material such as this.
2,Very limited content,"I'd expect to see little bit more content from this book. However it is very limited. If you are looking to buy this book as your ""very"" first ruby on rails book then it may do the justice for you. Otherwise I would not recommend it."
1,Waste of time and money,very poor book. i have read many Ruby programming books. this comes in last.
5,A Lyrical Journey,"I have followed Nightnoise for many years, and have never missed an opportunity to see them in concert. Their debut album, AT THE END OF THE EVENING, wove a masterful tapestry of vocal and instrumental elements that set a standard of virtuosity that raised my expectations with each album release. Another reviewer lamented the relative absence of Triona Domnhaille's voice. While it is true she does not sing as much on this album as previously, her vocal efforts are even more appreciated.At my first hearing I found myself drawn up into the music and carried along from piece to piece, as on a journey. When Triona adds her voice, it is with purpose and intention, as if the album was more than just a collection of songs, but the sum of its parts. Nightnoise may have taken us on a journey to a different shore, but hearing Triona's voice toward the end of the album assured me I had not traveled alone. A Different Shore is an exquisite lyrical journey."
3,Nightnoise provides an hour of light listening.,"A DIFFERENT SHORE is one of Nightnoise's most listenable albums and never before has their production so well reflected their fusion of Celtic, jazz, and chamber music elements.The album's opening track, ""Call of the Child,"" is a relatively simple guitar-heavy song, but it is with ""For Eammon"" that the mood is set. ""For Eammon"" is lush and haunting, and the album's closer, ""Shuan,"" is very similar.In fact, most of the tracks here are mood pieces, with only ""The Call of the Child"" and ""The Busker on the Bridge"" refraining from an airy, ethereal sound. Plus, there's ""Falling Apples,"" the only track with lyrics, provided by Triona Ni Dhomnaill. In some ways, it is the low point of the album, as the sudden voice breaks the continuity.While not an incredible important release, A DIFFERENT SHORE beats most of the new-agey music out there with its musical excellence, genuine compositional talents, and bold realization."
2,Poor Design,"Unlike most Sony products, this carrying case is not worth buying--it's too hard to install and remove the Clie from this case and the plastic clips are flimsy. It makes the Clie almost too fat to put in your pocket and doesn't protect your investment from dust or moisture. Save your money for something better..."
5,The hardest working musician from Acadiana,"This ain't your traditional Cajun musical group! Wayne Toups, the self-proclaimed king of ""Zydecajun"", has created a Cajun/Zydeco/Country/Tabasco fusion unlike any other sound.While I'm partial to traditional Cajun, Toups' music is so compelling, creative and energetic that I've become a convert. He plays a killer schedule worldwide and is known for leaving it all on the stage. I've seen the band play at Mulate's and it was awesome. The ballads are of equal quality, with lyrics and melodies that soothe the soul.Vive Wayne Toups!"
4,"So far, so good","Although I may get around to using this for ab and dumbbell work, I actually ordered it to use as a form of therapy for a respiratory condition. I have bronchiectasis in one lung, as well as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and clearing my lungs is sometimes impossible for me on my own. My pulmonologist suggested an inversion table or gravity boots to to assist with postural drainage, but I don't think I could deal with being completely upside down for long enough for it to do me any good!If I lay on the bench in a position to use it for crunches, with it set at its steepest angle, I can rest comfortably for 20 minutes or more and it has been enormously beneficial to me as a respiratory aid. I've had no problems with its construction (though it was a pain in the rear to assemble) or stability. I would definitely recommend it as part of a home gym, or in my case, respiratory therapy. :)"
4,good bang for the buck,"This ab bench delivers on what it promises. It's sturdy and looks like it will last a lifetime. The set up was pretty convenient--the lugs/nuts are pretty oversized so that made assembly quite easy. While it does fold up, I think once it's set up, you're most likely going to find it easier to keep it in workout mode.The tilt for working out the small of the back is great--you can adjust the cross-bar support to suit pretty much any height from 5'4' to 6'6"" I'd say."
3,good product for the money,This bench is very easy to use and has several functions. Overall I like this bench and I don't feel as if I have wasted my money.
3,So Confused,"I wanted this Item for you guessed It, To workout and It arrived before the estimated date which was a plus with the fourt of July right In the way. My biggest con on this product Is the Instructions I got confused with attaching the seat to the bench just had to wing It. I hope that In the future they Include an Instuctional dvd for the girly girl hany girls like myself. I would have rated higher especially for the price Amazon has It for **** four stars!!!"
3,"Decent, but flawed","I like this bench for some of its basic functions, but it could have been soooo much better...If you only do straight, traditional sit-ups, and if you are under 190 pounds or so, then this is ok for you. If, however, you are broad in the upper body then you will find the back-rest to be too narrow. It is also virtually impossible to veer off to the side for oblique-focused sit-ups, as you will surely fall off if you are not holding on to the hand-grip, which rather defeats the purpose of a sit-up in the first place.Is is fine for back-extensions, in case that's all you use it for.Anyway, that's my 2 cents...hope it helps."
4,Good Deal,The height of the leg hold is a little short for doing decline sit ups. I will have to drill new holes and move it up. As a roman chair it works great. The welds are good and it's pretty stable.
4,Its good,"I recently purchased this bench and over all its good. It's biggest down sides are its cost and its somewhat challenging to put together. The instructions read like they were written by someone who uses english as a second language.Otherwise, I like the product. It definitely targets the abs and I like that its storable. All of my exercise equipment has this feature so that I can save space. Its comfortable and easy to use. So, if you can afford it and have the patience to construct it, I think it is a good product and I am happy with it so far."
5,"Good, versatile bench- for the money","A lot has already been said on the construction of this bench, so I will chime in with a quick: I like this bench.I like this bench. It is solid and fairly versatile; I wanted an ab bench that I could also use for Roman chair (hyper extensions), and sitting on for shoulder presses, etc.The bench has a small adjustable range, but I have found it to be exactly what I need. I don't need forty positions when four will do the job nicely.The lock pin alignment could use some work, but I honestly feel that as I use the bench more that will become easier (familiarity and all that).I give the bench five stars because I feel I got my money's worth and then some. I feel confident this bench will last me many years."
4,back exercises,"Its a great addition to my home gym it can be used for back exercise ( why I bought it ) abs , preacher curls it a good bench ."
4,It is a workout but somewhat uncomfortable,"It seems sturdy enough to last a while. It does its job and gives you a good workout. However, the bench part is a bit too short that you cannot rest your head so its kinda uncomfortable. It was a pain to put together but once is built you will see is durable."
4,Good product for the price,"I was looking for a machine that can help with both my back and abe during my recovering from back surgery. This is an excellent buy for around $100, does everything I am looking for without taking too much space or burn a hole in my wallet."
5,Receiver Extender,Bought this to extend my bike rack beyond the bumper of my rv. It works just as described and is very heavy duty. No worries about this breaking while traveling.
3,Hitch extender doesn't hold anti- tilt,"Extension is ok but my anti-tilt bracket doesn't hold against hitch extension because it grasp the weld of the hitch, so not very happy considering I purchased this extension to avoid this from happening (same problem I was having with the SUV hitch)."
2,Poorly manufactured.,"I bought this extension to get past the rear spare on my jeep, but it was so poorly made, I can only use if for the motorcycle carrier, not hitch mounted rack. The hole through the shank is seriously crooked, which tilts everything attached to it. Normally I'd just turn it 90 and drill new holes, but I don't have the means to drill through two solid inches of steel.... A real disappointment."
3,Very lose fit and not for towing,"As others ave stated, it is a basic hunk of steel. However, it is not sized correctly. The male end is a little small and the female end is a little big. The result is a very sloppy fit. I use if for a bike rack and the rack swings back and forth while I am driving.The unit also has a sticker on it saying it is not for towing. Are you kidding? This is a hitch part, towing is a basic feature it should handle."
2,OK...Just,"This seems to be a revenue raising excercise. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. And the sound was ""iffy""."
3,Earnest debut by a fresh director.,"I bought ""Fat Girls"" after Joy Nash recommended it in her blog, along with ""Disfigured"". While I wasn't hugely impressed by it's general lack of depth, it still left me in a happy place. I was mostly happy with the lack of stereotypes, exception of the boy's mother, and there were definitely parts where I screamed with laughter and indignation. (The fat girl best friend actually had self worth! And danced at a dance! Minor miracle for a movie. And the gay guy wasn't a flamboyant parody - he was actually portrayed more as a human than a characature, which was refreshing.)Annoying in places but good at heart.Can't wait to see what else Ash Christian churns out as he matures artistically."
2,Fat Girls = Depressed Homosexual EMO's?,"Hearing about this movies plot sounded interesting and I thought it was going to be a hilarious movie, but I ended up walking away from it depressed.If you like the sound of a wining winging gay student who wants to be a Broadway dancer who thinks he is a fat girl trapped inside a mans body, while having an depressing emo friend and an immigrant dork hitting on her throughout the movie, then this one is sure to please you.edit: sorry i gave it two stars, I meant to press -2"
1,What ever happened to quality tools?,"I hate to sound like an old curmudgeon, but it seems as though even relatively expensive tools like this are simply not made well anymore. Even with something incredibly uniform and easy to spread, like limestone, this spreader was a horror. It would spread nothing, it would dump big thick lines, it would spread on one side of the hopper but not the other. Same with fertilizer, and forget using something a little more challenging, like composted cow manure. The biggest problem, aside from an overall plasticity, is that the spinning rod inside the hopper has tiny tines that seem to do nothing. I'm sending it back, then investigating the Scotts 1000. If the Scotts one is just as crappy, at least it costs half as much."
1,Bad spreader,"I would agree with the person above. I kept mine and now I'm looking for a new one. I have had it for 1 year and the handle bars have bent, the fertilizer does not spread evenly. It either comes out too fast or too slow. The on/off handle falls apart during use. If you use it too much the cord falls out and you have a very heavy amount of fertilizer. I have to carry a screw driver with me in case it falls apart. Overall it is very expensive and does not work well."
1,Dont waste your time or your money,"Dont waste your time or your money!Firstly, I think this piece of software must have built by a blind person. It was impossible to use, very cumbersome, and very difficult to figure out. Secondly, when I tried to call the company to get some help, I couldn't believe how rude, and uninformed their staff are. The leads themselves were not all that accurate, and the whole process process wasn't worth a single dime."
1,Sales Leads USA Business Edition DVD,"Unfortunately, there are many releases of this product, and these listings dont say what year they were released, nor provide any way to contact the seller before the sale to find out. I'll buy elsewhere"
4,Wood simply explodes with this.,"I have both a True Temper super splitter and a regular 8lb traditional splitting maul. For 75% of the jobs I use this 4lb splitter and wood simply explodes. I'm splitting 30 feet away from my house and often i'm hitting my house with a split oak log when i give it a good wack.. This spliter is really forgiving, I would have broken the handle on a lesser tool on some of the off hits I've done. I use the heavier 8lb traditional maul on the really big, thick and heavy pieces of oak if they aren't fully cured. I've already filled up 2 full 4' high x 8' long log racks with just fallen trees from Hurricane Sandy, all split with this splitter. I'm covering the wood and seasoning it for next fall and winter."
5,Great topical reference,"I feel that this book provides excellent coverage of all of the important, implementable, models for providing service differentiation in the Internet. While it doesn't precisely tell me how to implement QoS, it does provide excellent reference points against which to measure effectiveness of an implementation in providing useful QoS. I find that I am using this book a lot in my work and expect that this will continue to be the case for a while."
2,too superficial,"The author has been actively involved in networking research for a long time. I bought his book hoping to gain some insight. Instead, I found it quite disappointing. The content is too superficial. I am actually not sure what audience this book is targeting. For me, I am looking for in depth analysis, at the least, it should provide good reference for each topic covered so that I have a starting point if I want to go to detail. For a person looking for basic understanding, this book also tries to go to too much detail, for example, on how each protocol works. I think he is just trying to fill the pages. I did not proof read it on purpose, but at least one reference (I happen to be familiar with it) is totally wrong. The paper is talking about routing prefix expansion, but he quoted them totally wrong."
4,Internet QoS: Architectures and Mechanisms for Quality of Service (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Networking),I didn't receive it yet
3,birds of madagascar,"The organization of this guide is the strangest I have ever seen. The basis is the number of the bird in the guide. Maps are only id by number of the bird, no name. Bird pictures again use the numbers and are not listed in numerical order. The information is comprehensive and helps to make up for the difficulty finding it. Pictures and maps are not presented with the listings but separately which leads to possibly requiring one to view 3 pages at a time."
5,Revive Your JukeBox,The battery fit just fine in my Nomad Juke Box. The battery that came with the Juke Box would no longer hold a charge. This replacement has charged up nicly and holds a good charge. I am buying a second to have avalble. Its a hell of a lot chepper then buying a new MP# player.
2,Not real impressed,"I am not real impressed with this product it does not shave close and leave your legs soft and smooth, I was hoping for a better product."
3,Fairly good,"I bought it for my wife mostly because of high star ratings and the fact that it is dual voltage capable(220/110). But we were disappointed because the battery always ran out after 5-10 mins. But since customer service from Discount Jungle was fantastic, we were able to return it and get another piece with no hassles. We had to pay our part of shipping charge which is not bad.The second one runs for about 40 mins after full charge. My wife is fairly happy with the product. Only complain is that it is loud."
3,ON/OFF Button VERY DIFFICULT to keep holding down when using,"I have fine thin hair, and it didn't shave it off evenly, it missed a lot. The worst part is that it is VERY DIFFICULT to handle it while having to hold the on-button down. They need a on/off switch! It would shave better if it did, because you wouldn't have to hold your hand in an uncomfortable postion, with your thumb not staying on the button when you needed it to."
4,electric razor,"it works great for underarms and legs.I don't like any pubic hair at all, and it keeps it shaved completely smooth, everyday!!great razor!"
4,A Great Razor,"Finally a woman's razor that actually provides a close shave!! It took no time at all for my legs to get used to it. It holds a charge a long time as it says so I don't have to keep it in the charger somewhere. The only down side is like someone else wrote, it is rather loud, but you get used to it. Nice razor, no more nicks!!"
2,Keep looking,"This is not a quality razor. It does not shave closely and requires many, many runs over the same area to trim half a hair. It's very disappointing and not worth .05, let alone the sales price."
4,"Good, consistent product",I have had several Remington razors and I have always liked the consistent quality of Remington products.
3,Remington WDF-6000 shaver,"OK, but not great because you can not lock the razor in the ON position making the shaving process more complicated than it should be."
3,Very loud.,"It works quite well, as far as electric razors go. Dry, it does a decent job of getting rid of visible hair, but there is usually a little stubble left that you can feel if your run your hands up and down your legs. In the shower it works nearly as well as regular razor. There might be certain areas this one can't get to that you will have to touch up on with a normal razor.The only real complaint I have is how loud it is. Everyone in your house WILL know when you are shaving your legs."
4,battery dies too soon,"I like this enough to have bought another one once the first one died (upon being dropped on a tile floor)... but the battery is not sufficient for shaving my legs all the way up. I can get up to my mid thighs done and then it croaks. The worst part is that as the battery dies I find it starts to nick me. It also gives me nicks occassionally when I do awkward angular spots like armpits, backs of knees, and bikini line. I like how it cuts both short and long hair. Big improvement over an older model Remington I had."
4,Works Well,"This shaver is really nice, and does a good job shaving my legs. I don't use it often, but have tried it in the shower and it worked great wet too. Would buy again."
2,OUCH!,Holy cow this hurts! it scratches and nicks and drags and pulls. This razor /shaver is one of the worst ever. the best one ever they seem to have available only in foreign countries or not at all. My good one's battery died and they tell me I cannot replace it.Do not buy this unless you are into pain and want to get ingrown hairs.
4,PURCHASER,MY WIFE HAS COMPLAINED FOR YEARS ABOUT OTHER ELECTRIC SHAVERS. THE WDF 6000 WORKS FINE AND SHE ACTUALLY SAYS SHE LOVES HOW IT WORKS. I'D RECOMMEND AND GOOD FOR GIFTING.
4,Solid razor,"Takes a little while to get used to an electric razor, but once you get the hang of it, it works pretty well. Don't expect it to be as smooth as a blade, but it's pretty good.Loud, though."
1,HURTS!,"It didn't shave my legs as close as a razor when I used it dry. Using it wet or dry took much longer than a razor.It REALLY HURT my armpits. They were all red, and it did an awful job; I still had clearly visible stubble. Seriously, it hurt so bad.If you really don't like shaving in the shower, you are fine with having stubbly legs, and don't mind taking a longer time to shave, then by all means buy this and have stubbly legs. Just don't use it on your armpits."
1,ZERO STARS,"This razor was horrible. It gave me razor burn on my armpits for 3 days after using it-I had trouble wearing a shirt! Yes, I do have sensitive skin but I have never had this happen before when shaving.Stay away-far away from this razor!"
4,Good book but not all the answers,This book is a good start toward understanding how to build Access applications. Some of the details are missing. An example would include the proper syntax for referencing fields in a form.
4,what a price!,I really like this CD when I bought from the guys who published it back in 1995. What a crazy price of 300 dollars I see here. hahahaahhaahh. oh really!
4,powerful and quick,This dries even thick hair quickly. I'm not as fond of the ion method as I thought I'd be. It seems to change the texture of my hair.
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this hair dryer over numerous other models since it appeared to be better quality than several other brands. Unfortunately, after 2 months of light use (every other day for a few minutes), the hair dryer began to fail. It certainly does boast a nice feature list, is fairly quiet compared to other full-size models, and the design is nice in your hand. But, I cannot recommend the dryer based on it's poor quality."
2,Fan Has Bearing Design or Spec Problems,"I've had this hair dryer for 2 years and for the past year it squeals with a loud high pitch unexpectedly (really wakes a person up) and you have to immediately turn it off. Then it's ok for awhile, then it squeals *loudly* again. It's related somewhat to the position or orientation of the hair dryer and cold start temperature. After a year I've noticed that it squeals whenever the room temperature is below about 71 deg. F, say, in the wintertime. But now it basically squeals all the time until the unit is warmed up. Other people have stated this problem, you can search this online using this product name, model. It should have been a factory recall. It's most likely due to poor motor bearing specifications. I recently bought a new hair dryer, a different brand, to replace this Remington SuperSonic dryer. I am a engineering professional degreed in several areas."
5,A good buy,"This hairdryer is by far the best I have yet purchased. I always like to try new things, so I bought a Revlon and a Conair because I wanted to see if maybe I would be just as pleased. No way. The Conair Ionic hairdryer did not have the same power (even though it was 1875), and the Revlon Tourmaline was just too loud. My Remington Supersonic lasted four years of heavy use. I am buying another one!"
1,Up in smoke,"After one year of light use this hairdryer literally went up in smoke today. It started to make more noise than normal and a few seconds later smoke was pouring out of it. Beyond the fireworks, this unit was bigger and noisier than I expected. It was serviceable, but the build quality was suspect."
5,Best Dryer I've ever had!!!,"This is truly the best dryer I have ever had. I have had several different brands and models over many years, and this one is hands down the best! I've got pretty thick hair, and from start to finish it takes about 6-7 minutes to dry my shoulder length hair. I would recommend it to anyone. It's a great buy! Oh, and I almost forgot, it truly leaves your hair shiny and not staticky!"
4,Kindle Version - Great stories but with some text errors,"I thoroughly enjoyed all three stories in this volume, but I found the typographical errors to be somewhat distracting. I imagine that they were caused during optical scanning of the original printed version and not caught before releasing the electronic Kindle version. For example, in Chapter IX of the last story the book reads, ""I have had you together; now FU take you one by one; and FU start with Mrs. Pitcairn."" I am guessing that ""FU"" is meant to be ""I'll"" (I will). It seems like even a casual check would have caught errors like this one, and there are others scattered through the book. Still, the stories themselves are a real treat. The chemistry and banter between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin is first rate."
3,A good look at late 80's SOD,"These two discs contain material that is also available on Outlands and BBC Radio One in concert. The first disc contains the demos for Outlands. The versions don't vary too much, except for the lack of audio effects. The sound quality is a little bit sub par, but the songs are good. The second disc, Live at the National is a fantastic live concert. The sound quality is great, and the set is strong. Rocketship and Mickey sound great even without saxaphone. The ending of Mickey with the crowd chanting along is great, as is the piano on Once in her Lifetime(the best vesion of this song). Pumpkin Man and Embassy Song are at their best in this set as well. This disc is a good buy if you don't already have the material on it, but I might skip it if you already have BBC Radio One in concert."
5,Received as advertised. No Problems,We received the product in a timely manner. All the plates were received without damage. The product was of expected quality with no defects. Thanks.
3,Better than expected,"Being a Yes fan, I bought this on a whim when I found it cheap. Surprisingly, it's not bad at all. Don't let that ""Teakbois"" monstrosity from the Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe album fool you; Anderson actually can make good world-beat music and he does it here. All the tunes are quite pleasant, and the slew of Latino guest performers keeps things interesting. I would think any Yes fan would get some enjoyment out of this."
2,Not what you'd expect from the Yes family,"This was originally released early 1994 by Windham Hill Records (also the former home of Yanni). This was overshadowed by the group release ""Talk"" shortly after. Anderson can't always please us all both in a group and on his own like most people have. He's become a part of that new age/world music scene. Most of the songs are in Portuguese, pertaining to the Brasilian theme, and possibly some in Spanish (where's Peggy Hill when you need her?!). Featuring two tracks with Brasil's own superstar Milton Nascimento (who I only heard of through Duran Duran). Real hardcore fans might want this, otherwise it doesn't seem like a Yes solo album. It could be anyone. Even his albums with that other Greek artist, Vangelis, are more approachable for Yes fans. Not that ""Deseo"" was good or not, it's just not my bag. You be the judge."
2,Not really a strong performance from JA,"I listen to this cd, but not all that much. Nothing grabs me when I listen to this. Not enough musical muscle to keep my attnetion. I like JA, but this one is sorta forgettable."
5,Spanish rock from a Brit,"It's spanish rock, no it's prog rock...no it's two great sounds in one.I love Jon Anderson's vocals, and i love spanish guitar. this CD is great"
2,Hear it for what it is,"... and what it is: a mixed bag. This isn't a bad album, but it's also not likely to convert anyone to listen to more Latin American music, which is too bad: like several of Jon's 90s albums, he appropriates an existing style without really seeming to have captured the spirit.Personally, I'd give this about 2.5 stars. I don't fault Jon for trying to do ""world music""; it's not far from the spirit he has always pursued, and seems more obviously a natural fit than David Byrne making REI MOMO. But Byrne succeeded by simply grafting his lyrics onto a different style of dance music than he had previously done; Jon struggled, possibly because he was never a composer of dance music in the first place. The result is largely more pleasant than compelling.2.5 stars would be about right: a few performances you'll want to hear again, and the rest agreeably bland. Just don't listen to it after REI MOMO, which will probably make you want to buy more real merengue"
5,Great overview for those interested in the JAG Corps.,"Naval Law is a thorough overview of the fascinating legal specialty known as military justice. As a law student interested in the JAG Corps, I have not found a more comprehensive description of the subject matter practiced by military lawyers. From courts-martial to non-judicial punishment, the reader will quickly recognize how justice and discipline compete in what the United States Supreme Court has called a specialized society, namely the United States military services. -- Jim Sanzi, Boston College Law Student"
3,A valuable tome for the 1993 JAG Lawyer,"Until recently, this book was a staple of basic military justice at the U.S. Naval Academy. Unfortunately, in the years since it was written, several aspects of military justice have changed dramatically. New cases in search and seizure and self-incrimination; fascinating developments in the laws of armed conflict; and the natural procedural ""creep"" of jurisprudence have all conspired to limit the usefulness of this otherwise well-written text.Despite the above criticism, Mr. Filbert's book is still heads and tails above the texts currently used at the other service academies. Likewise, its utility as a basic outline of military justice to the novice reader should not be over looked.I have heard that a new edition is in the works. I am hopeful that it will correct the deficiencies of the third edition."
2,What's the relationship between Siri Gjre & Tord Gustavsen,"I've heard many excellent works of Tord Gustavsen,that's why I asked for this one.But, I'm surprised.It's like kinder songs.It makes me wonder that maybe there's something between this two.It's an expensive cd and it's not worth it."
1,look elsewhere,"The fence was ill-fitting. I had to sand down the underside of the table to allow any movement at all. The fence glides awkwardly, and requires some ingenuity to position. Overall, the fence-table unit is a disgrace to engineering. I would strongly advise any would-be buyers to look elsewhere."
4,Router Table review,"I have used this router table for close to 3 years.I agree that the fence can be difficult to use when using the end guides, but I don't. I use, enjoy, and appreciate the pivot function of the fence!I don't like the track or groove for a sliding square and feather board as it is too far far from the router, but it's not a huge deal for me.I like all the fine adjustments to keep all the top components pefrectly level. I like how easily I can pull the router and it's plate out. My router is PC 3+ horse hog and I don't like leaving in the table.I got the table second-hand, but it was close to new. I was missing a few parts and called CMT. They did not require proof of purchase, nor ask for a purchase date, but readily sent out all the pieces I needed at no charge to me!! Their customer service was great."
5,Quality Replacement,I am very pleased with the product. A good value. It made it new again. Very easy to replace the blades. Best total price from Amazon. Quick free delivery as usual from Amazon.
5,Shaving smooth again,Having new heads makes a real difference. After I got these I was reminded of how nice the original razor was.
3,Heads & Cutters Okay...but Shaver is worn!,"I ordered new heads and cutters for my reconditioned Remington Model 900 series. Installed assembly and commenced shaving. Having a 2 day growth, the shaver seemed to ""struggle"" to get through the process. I suspect the power to the rotating spindles is fading...hence it took close to 10 minutes to get a ""smooth"" shave.I have recently purchased a Braun 760 and now experience a fast, close comfortable shave. I plan on keeping the Remington for travel or backup purposes."
5,Like NEW Shaver,I almost bought a brand ne electric shaver but decided to give these replacement heads a try first. WOW! It feels like I DID buy a new shaver. They work great!
5,Remington rotary shaver cutter replacement,"The replacement cutter assembly kit arrived very fast, & theprice was right. They also work just fine. When these wear out,I will order more from this vendor. Thanks"
5,review of cutters & heads for electric razor,"I had looked everywhere for replacement cutter/heads for my Remington electric razor, I mean EVERYWHERE!!! Then out of the blue I decided to check Amazon and --there they were!!! I had even gone as far as getting a newer razor but was not happy with it. So, I am sold on Amazon and will be looking there alot more because of this experience!!!"
3,"It is a quite good pocket PC, but...","Generally, I was impressed by the slim design. The price is affordable, and the resolution and color was good. However, the battary seems a problem. Also, the power button is quite difficult to turn power on and off. The color screen changes to dull color suddenly. Otherwise, it is a good pocket PC."
1,Constantly Locks up,"I bought this model (...), and I had to return it because it kept locking up, glitching, or malfuncioning in one way or another (sometimes the transcriber wouldn't work, sometimes applications wouldn't work, sometimes the scheduler light didn't turn off, sometimes the unit itself wouldn't turn off, etc.) I wound up returning it as defective, and then I bought the exact same model (...). I had the same problems. It wasn't defective, it's just a poor-quality device. Now, after 1 year, It won't even turn on, and I can't get it fixed because the repairs would cost more than the unit. I'm now out $269.00.I miss my pocket pc because I used it all the time. I feel lost without it, but yet, it'll be a long time before I buy another one. I think the technology isn't very advanced yet."
5,I like it!,"I really like the Toshiba e 335, I use it mainly because I travel a lot, and it is easier to carry than my lap top. I wished that you offered a free download that allows you to communicate with ACT 6.0. I thought I was saving money with all the rebates but I had to spend either $70.00 or $ 50.00 on software from Companion Link, or Intellisync. When you purchase any product with a Palm OS system, ACT has a free download that allows you to communicate with them.That was the only problem I had. Other wise I am really enjoying my Pocket PC.BH"
2,Sync Connectivity,"Even though my experience has been extremely limited with this product I think it will be a 5 star eventually. Make very sure that your computer isnt running Windows NT because this product has USB sync capabilities, but NT wont recognize a USB port. I have spent the last week trying to find some sort of adapter to go from USB to serial. If you try to sync using IRD everytime you will have to do a new partnership every time you sync. This things looks like it will be great but I cant get started using all it's functions yet."
1,Toshiba SUCKS! Buy better!,"Toshiba doesn't offer any support for products after a newer model is lanched. While everyone else can evolve with technology, you will have to keep buying new units from Toshiba to keep up. No Thanks."
4,It's really just good for the money,"I have had this PDA for a couple of weeks and I would say that for the money its great. Sure there are better PDA's but this one does what I need at a low price.I had a little trouble getting it to ""Activesync"" the first time but thats becuase I didnt bother to read the quick start guide. Since then it has worked 100% of the time. (Running Windows XP)I actually have a second one on order for my wife.It does take some getting used to and has a learning curve. I was a heavy PalmOS guy and it was a change but now.. ""I get it"".Someday I would love to get the IPAQ but until I can shell out $500-$600... for the price this is perfect."
4,Stylish and highly functional!,"The Toshiba e335 simply put, is highly compact (form-factor should be a decision for mobile owners) and combines the power and versatility of the newer XScale processors. Other comparable PDAs like the Dell Axim5 are great in terms of price and functionality but come closer to looking like some of the new tablet PCs out there (size matters!). No complaints about the software included - I love the MS suite included. All my authored documents i.e. MS Word, Adobe Acrobat work beautifully on this device - it supports editing and so forth as well. The Arcsoft software is decent, having it come bundled with the PDA makes you avoid some of the free buggy programs out there."
1,do NOT buy if you travel -- major conceptual problem here,"A wonderful little machine if you want to be a slave to always finding a power outlet within 24 hours -- or lose all data!!Imagine a PC which loses ALL data when unplugged. That's what the Toshiba 330 & 335 are. Since all data is stored in RAM, when the battery runs out, all data is lost.The problem is that the battery runs out in 24-30 hours even when TURNED OFF!This is a scenario I don't ever want to experience: arrive in London for the big meeting. Been in airports for 12 hours, tired. Head to hotel. Don't have English adapter plug, so don't plug in. Fall asleep. Wake up 8 hours later. Poof! Your meeting address, notes and contacts are gone.Yeah! What a concept. Perhaps I'm missing something here, but this is one of the worst user-experience flaws I've seen in a long time.Buy an old Palm. You might not have all the widgets, but at least you'll know where you're supposed to be."
3,Light PDA,"Just make it short, I gave this PDA a three stars because it's light and stylish. Two bad things I found about this pda is that no compact flash slot, everything (all the contact lists and phone numbers) will be gone if you don't charge your pda for about 1 week, unless you save that to the SD card first."
1,Nothing but problems,"I've had my E335 for just over one week, and already it has frozen on me twice, where a soft restart would not work. I was forced to do a hard restart loosing all the programs I had installed and the information (contacts, calandars, etc.) I had put on it. After the second time, I took it back and started looking for another brand. This PDA is definately not worth it."
1,Sleek but Useless - NOT for Travellers,"Please do not purchase this PDA if you plan to travel.I purchased the Toshiba e335 for its features and tempting price rebates.The PocketPC is as described: sleek, attractive, great functionality, easy to use. The hotsync with my PC did not install properly _ windows XP, but the Toshiba helpdesk was competent and friendly, and solved the installation problems. Afterwards, the syncronization worked perfectly while at home recharging the battery daily.They fail to warn you that the battery drains off completely after 24 hours - read other similar experiences - even with the PDA OFF. Once it happens, with the hard-reset, you lose ALL your DATA.The major reason I wanted to own a PDA is to have my contacts and appointments available while working remotely. In my first overnight trip, the PDA died out.I'm extremelly disappointed. The Toshiba worked beautifully as long as you are connected to a power supply, which beats its purpose."
2,great if it worked,"I recently received the e335. I am a palm user, but was seduced by a $... amazon rebate and a $... toshiba rebate. At approximately $... net, how could you lose on this 64 mb thin machine? Well, I lost. On day three the machine started to freeze. I rebooted once and had to reinstall everything. And then, 30 minutes later, it happened again.When it worked, I loved it. Unfortunately it was a VERY short love afair."
3,Works Fine but Needs Two Cables,"All USB 2.0 High Speed 2.5"" External Enclosures are not created equal.This one works perfectly in high speed USB, but requires two USB cables to provide enough power for my ex-laptop hard drive. I also have (and recommend) anIrocks 2.5IN HDD Enclosure Blk USB 2.0 Aluminum IlluminatedExternal Enclosure. The i-rocks requires only one cable to operate - no second cable for power is required. The two units (Mad Dog and i-rocks) were compared using the SAME hard drive, the same cable, and the same USB port. The Mad Dog is prettier, better built mechanically, and slightly more compact than the i-rocks, but the necessity for the second cable makes it significantly less flexible than the i-rocks."
1,Ink Hog--No bargain,"While the initial cost of the printer is indeed cheap and the quality is fine, it's not worth it. I can print about 40-50 pages in black and white draft mode before running out of ink. At $15/cartridge, that costs me about $.30 a page. Way too expensive for everyday use."
1,"Take notice of the ""uses lots of ink"" reviews","Bought this in September and already looking for another printer, because running costs are too high. The quality is reasonable, but this printer drinks ink. The ink cartridges seem reasonably priced, but they contain a tiny amount of ink (only 0.17 fl oz according to the box - my eye drops bottle is 0.67 fl oz) and run out quickly. 10 cents a page might not sound like a lot, but it soon adds up and there are cheap printers out there with printing costs under 3 cents a page. Check out consumer reports and pay attention to the text cost column."
4,Very good printer for the price,"Easy to hook up, loading drivers takes about 40 minutes. Works well with both XP and Win 2000. Very good quality color prints. Life of the cartridges , I dont know yet. So far we have printed only 20-30 prints."
5,Perfect size,"If you are somewhat limited on space, this is the printer for you! Although small in size, it is big on quality. The copies are clear and dark. We don't make a huge amount of copies, using it mostly for school projects and household printing; this printer has been perfect for us."
2,Economy? Doubt it.,"What this printer does is print good quality copies.What it doesn't do is offer any sort of long term operation that won't cost the user a fortune. The ink jet cartridges are so small that when I first took one out of the box I thought it was a joke. Along with that, that ""economical"" printer gives the user no way to adjust intensity of copy. I guess HP wouldn't want to slow sales on those inkjet cartridges.In short, if you value your money and plan to make more than a copy or two a month, you probably can't afford this printer. Did I mention that the cartridges aren't even available from the secondary market/cartridge refillers so you will pay top dollar?I got a ""more expensive"" laser printer (I almost never print color) which is amazing and economical. Long term. Loving it, saving $."
4,good product for excellent price,"We just got this in the mail, as our old one finally croaked. this is a good printer, for an excellent price and produces good quality documents. i chose it for its durability, low price, resolution and low price of ink cartridges. works great for my needs of printing recipes, ebay shipping labels, and occasional resumes. cool little feature is a window that shows ink levels before printing a documentmy reason for 4 stars is that it only has the dummy lights with no little screen to tell you what's wrong. if something is, its either a guessing game of pushing different buttons, looking frantically through the manual or calling my IT Tech husband and acting like a whiny customer. :)so far, the above situation has occurred only once, and what hubby did was turn off the queue on the computer that stores the documents before printing them. this way, there's no lag time/delay and docs print right away.all in all, love this guy! definitely a good buy!"
5,Mary,"I thought this printer was too good to be true since it sold for about the price of a printer cartridge. It has exceeded our expectations. It produces a perfect copy for all our work, home, church needs. Highly recommend it."
3,suggestions,"Has anyone used this printer with the new Vista OS? I just bought a HP computer/ monitor/ printer package and the printer (hp photosmart d5069) has been giving me so much trouble. Not sure if it has anything to do w/ Vista or not. i have tried to fix the problem but its going no where. So, i was searching around for another printer as i'm thinking I may need to return the photosmart one, and this one seems like what I'm looking for. I order most of my pictures online, so I don't really need one w/ too many photo printing capabilities. i print mostly text and graphics. So if anyone could give me any insight, i'd appreciate it.Thank you,Joanna"
5,works like a charm,"For the price this is one of the better printers I have ever had. It is really easy to set up it even came with the disc for windows vista, Works like a charm. No problems whatsoever, five stars."
2,tempermental printer,"The printing quality is good...most of the time. Sometimes it cuts off things on the right hand side.Every single time it is called upon to print, an error message comes up stating that it is out of paper. There is plenty of paper, it just ""thinks"" there isn't any.Also, every time it prints, two blank sheets are sent out of the printer before it begins. It really is a strange printer. I have had great HP printers until this one."
5,Great value for a great printer,"I originally bought this to replace a discontinued line of HP printers, namely the 3320 series. What I liked about this series was that it took up very little surface space, while still printing in a timely manner. Unfortunately, it was out-dated, no longer had technical support and so needed a new printer to take its place.Searching high and low, I came upon a similar looking series by HP that may have been more bulky but still sat on top of my low narrow bookshelf without drawing much space to itself. It prints superbly though the buyer must be aware of the option that, while printing, the pages go backward (i.e. page 10, page 9,etc) so that page 1 is on top. For those that like to double-side their pages by printing odd then even pages, it may confuse you. I recommend either learning the pattern or going into Print Properties each time to disable the feature so the pages print ending ""Back to Front""."
1,disappointed,"I bought this about 2 months ago when my old printer tanked. I surf and print out a lot of what I find, and this machine uses ink at a phenomenal rate. On top of it, HP installs annoying software that starts to warn you that you're low on ink several pages before you run out - with a convenient link to order ink from them of course. Final straw - darn thing has started not to work right. I get messages about how the cartridges can't move - I can hear that - but I can't turn the machine as they tell me to because the light just blinks - it doesn't turn off. Then I've had a few paper jams, so today, I just ordered another printer - HP alas but it's supposed to use bigger ink cartridges. I don't know the number - it's blue, costs about $133 - I hope for better luck this time. (I looked at other brands but nothingpractical for me, so I'm back with HP although I am pretty unhappy with them after 2360 mess."
2,George Winston's worst album,"George Winston is a fantastic piano player and one of the best creators of ""mood"" music working today. Unfortunately, ""Forest"" just doesn't evoke much of a mood. At his best, Winston's music transcends the usual ""background"" music of your average new age artist. Unfortunately, that's what you get here, a lot of background music that just doesn't hold up when it moves to your brain's frontal lobe. Winston has produced many classic albums, from ""Autumn"" to ""Summer."" This just isn't one of them."
2,More mediocrity from the master of it,"Only ""Graceful ghost"" and ""Japanese music box"" stand out from yet another tepid album by Winston.The greatest portion of the disc consists of the usual new agey pomposity and insipidness.Question.Why is it that every new age pianist insists on being a Robert Schumann clone?The romantic movement played out 100 years ago ,but I guess someone forgot to tell the likes of George Winston."
5,3 year old loves Dora,"Great for the little Dora enthusiast. Pull on pants, velcro bracelet and velcro backed shirt. I like that Dora wears a painted on pink bra and underwear. This way when my daughter carries Dora around without the clothes, Dora is still dressed. The shoes are an issue as writen in other reviews except that my daughter seems to like putting her shoes on over and over again. Unlike all of her other dolls that just go without shoes because she can't do it herself. Dora's hair seems to stay flat and in place. It is also easy for my daughter to brush. Dog, backpack and book are a nice touch."
5,Love this doll,My daughter received this doll for Christmas and loves it!! She also received two outfits to go with it and loves getting her Dora readys for bed in her Pj's every night since. Today she had a blast dressing Dora up in the winter clothes so she could take her with us on our erronds. At almost 3 years old the clothes are simple enough that she has no problem undressing and redressing the doll by herself.
4,Great!,"I gave this to my 2 year old daughter for Xmas and she absolutely loves it. It is almost as big as she is and it is very sturdy. She has been carrying it around all day saying Dora is her best friend. Very cute. I like that it comes with the dog, backpack and book.The only drawbacks are that it doesn't come with Boots, Dora's monkey sidekick, instead it has a dog. And Dora's hair isn't very even and there are a lot of long, straggly strands of hair I had to even up so they wouldn't get caught on anything.But all in all it is a great toy that I foresee getting played with a lot."
4,Mixed Feelings,"I've given this toy 4 stars as my two Dora fans love the doll. It is a nice size and I like that you can buy all the extra clothes. The backpack, dog and book make it a nice complete present. My gripe as a parent is that in less than a month the doll's hair has become so matted that it can no longer be combed and she is certainly unrecognisable as Dora. It doesnt seem to spoil their enjoyment but it might for others."
2,bizarre,"A very strange collection. The whole synth-pop sound was best done by the English, so the best tracks on this collection are by Yazoo and New Order. Gang of Four run a close second. As for the rest...what a motley crowd; the panstick is definitely looking a little heavy. For absolute fans and completists only, especially given the price."
1,No mildew my foot!,"Not much to say: it sucked. I used the liner for 6 months in my shower and fought the mildew every day. I finally quit, bought a cheap $4 liner at Walgreens and haven't had to spray or scrub once in the last month!"
3,National Geographic's Pacific Northwest Driving Guide,"This book was disappointing. Although it boasts the, as always, lovely National Geographic photographs, the information and the writing are dated. It needs to be updated, at least."
1,Hard to install. Hard to remove. Not worth it.,"I just installed the Sony Clie screen protector on my NX70V. First of all, the installation didn't go smoothly. It was really hard to make sure that there's no air bubble. Then it was hard to hold and not touch the bottom side. I had fingerprints all over the thing.OK, I finally had the thing on. But the protector already had my fingerprints and they were visible. So I decided to remove them. But removing it was no easy task. It stuck to the screen and I had to pry it off from the corner. I was afraid of scratching my screen so I spent a lot of time to slowly lifted one corner. Finally I got it off.I think screen protector in general is more problem and it's not worth having. I'll use my Clie without protector from now on."
1,I agree,I also found that the screen protector seems like it does more harm than good. I don't see how anyone could think that this would protect a screen. It picks up fingerprints very easily and theres bubbles inside it that are impossible to get out.
1,What a Waste,"I never used a screen protector on my Clie SJ20. When it burned out after less than a year, I got a SJ22 and bought a screen protector.My SJ20 never had a mark on the screen. The screen protector on my SJ22, after one month, has so many marks from my stylus that it's hard to read in bright light. If you used thumbtacks instead of a stylus, maybe the screen protector would be helpful. Or if they sold for $.25 apiece and you replaced them weekly ... ?I'll stick with using the stylus and throwing away the screen protector."
2,Look elsewhere to protect your screen,"First off, I feel screen protectors are a must for PDAs. This screen protector just doesn't do a good job when compared to other alternatives. Does it even protect screens? Sure, but with some faults: 1) Only one protector is included. 2) Too thick. It's not a film like other brands, but a stiff sheet of plastic that feels awkward to write on. 3) It gets scratched! This does not make the protector reuseable.In the past, I've used the Fellows brand, but opted for this because of the price. Again, it's not worth it. When I'm through with this screen protector because of all the streaks and whirls on it, I'm going back to Fellows.--Just my observations and humble opinion. : )"
3,Dust protector...,"The major danger to your screen is not the stylus; the stylus has a rather smooth tip. No, the danger comes from airborne particles that can come to rest on your screen. When the stylus is dragged over a relatively small particle, it acts like a sand-paper wand. Once you have a little scratch on your screen, it becomes a safe haven for more dust. Every time your stylus drags over the little dust repository, it scoops out a grain or two, digging longer and further trenches into your screen.The sony screen protector may not be the best on the market, but it does fit the screen, and it does the job.I installed mine while riding on the bus, it went on fine - no bubbles, no worries. Three stars because it is too expensive, and there is no 2.5 star rating."
3,The Joys of Excel,"This book has mixed qualities. It is 'good' from the standpoint of being succinct in the explanations it does give.It is 'not good' from the standpoint of being cluttered by the meaningless effort to make it appear as a series of blueprints. This is simply more 'cutsie' than helpful.The chapters have no identifiers; the various statistical tests -- certainly more powerful than the average person needs --are not explained with any depth.The entire book gives the appearance of having been thrown together.Charles JusticeBloomington, Indiana"
5,AWESOME,"This is the best book I have found for excel. Quick, with just enough information to find almost anything to get you on the right track. Not for the beginner but more for the intermediate."
5,The Disciples,"Here is an outstanding exhaustively researched account of all the key players in Hitler's Third Reich. Without the help of these men, Hitler would not have come to power, let alone been a politician worthy of mention. It is interesting to read how at least one among his entourage did not want war, and how his stubbornness and hubris changed the course of history. A must read not only for those who are interested in the tumultous events of the 20th Century, but those in leadership positions in politics and other fields, or those aspiring to be in that position."
5,awesome!!,"Anthony Read manages to give an extremely accurate account of the leaders of Nazi Germany. He also gives detail to Nazism in general and World War 2, making this book very well rounded. Mr. Read's ability to keep his work interesting throughout is the icing on the cake."
2,"Weak story, everyone is a bad shot, bad die, hero & students live","Dolph Lundgren who plays an ""ex-highly trained"" soldier named Sam Decker has a weak love link 60 second walk on, and a 30 second walk on ""mean(?)principle"". Anyway for some reason two groups of DUMB criminals decide to do a drug/money switch at a high school, which NO ONE THOUGHT might not close right after the last class. Da... Anyway, the bad guys go through a lot of fancy semi-technical things to get into the school which a crowbar would have worked, kill the guard and ""discover"" there are ""school brats"" including a PG teen student and a teacher still in the school holding DENTETION (the name of this thing). Well all the bad guy can't shoot straight and all die and the students can shoot and fight and the teacher shoots fairly well but prefers to fight and all the bad guys die. END OF STORY. Save your money and go to Burger King."
3,not bad but,"the movie is good, but i would have love to see more of the vampyre , in the dvd comentary Werner Herzog, said that he didnt life the francis ford coppola version DRACULA , , but i liked coppola version better,"
3,"Utterly beautiful, but drags","This movie is worth owning just for the awesome, heart-stopping beauty of Isabelle Adjani. The cinematography is dreamlike, otherworldly. In some places this works but it drags and falls flat in others. Don't try to watch it if you're sleepy, the room is dim, or if you are in the presence of those who lose intrest and begin to babble when there are no car chases or explosions. It may be atmospheric, but it can't hold the attention of a group of post-college semi-intellectuals who have been drinking. Watch it alone."
4,Absolutely Haunting.,"This version of the Nosferatu story directed by Werner Herzog is just absolutely haunting. I have not seen the classic 'Nosferatu' made in the 1920s, but this is a prime modern example of how the real Dracula story is supposed to be. It is made by a man with real vision, craft, and maturity. Sadly, though, through countless remakes and spoofs, the Dracula story has become like a joke in our culture. Most people do not see the story as a tragedy. Dracula is seen as a kind of lady's man, rather than a cursed and lonely individual seeking love and affection. The highlight of the film is, of course, the performace of Klaus Kinski. He gives yet another stunning and creepy performance, playing the part of the tortured Count Dracula. Once again, bravo, for so few actors in film history can touch him."
3,"Nosferatu, The Vampyre 1979","I just love the way directors and script writers feel the need to rewrite Bram Stroker's ""Dracula."" Don't you? Well...they've done it again. This movie is not as good as the book. It is not even as good as the original movie (I've seen ""Nosferatu"" and you are not it).However, I can recommend this movie for the following reasons: 1) the scenery, beautiful and at times alien to many of us in the U.S. 2) Klaus' make-up (as good as the original) 3) the acting (a little broad at times but, hey) 4) the musicKlaus Kinski is a good actor and always plays interesting characters (and he helps make beautiful and talented children). Trust me, there are worse ways to spend some time. A bad rendition of ""The Messiah"" comes to mind. 8{"
2,Honestly I was disappointed,"I was disappointed in this movie because, it was so long and drawn out. There were a few good parts like the way the villagers acted when Jonathan said Count Dracula. Other than that I thought the movie was a waste and, I didn't like the way Count Dracula acted when he had Lucy. It was a gross out. Then again you don't have to take my word for it. Your opinion may be totally oppisite from mine."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,This is the first Werner Herzog movie I've seen and now I'm interested in seeing his other movies. As a big Dracula fan I can tell you this DVD rates in my top three list of the best Dracula movies. For those who do not like subtitles there are two versions here. I think the German version is superior. Enjoy!
3,neutral,"No comment on this as it was a gift for my son. amazon delivered as promised.my son has commented on this one way or the other, so i'm neutral on this particular item."
2,Inferior to the Original,"The problem with remaking classics films is that they can rarely live up to the standards of the original. Such is definitely the case in the anemic remake of the classic German silent film, Nosfaratu. Often times the vampire in this remake seems weak and ineffectual, as if Jonathan Harker should have been able to break him in two with a carefully placed karate chop. When he speaks he comes across as whiney instead of menacing. All of the actors seem to underplay their roles as if they were bored to death; there is a decided lack of human emotion. The supernatural elements of the original film seem oddly missing. The only thing the director really managed to do is create some breath-taking cinematography of rural europe. If you are a fan of the original film, my advice is to skip this remake and instead buy a copy of Shadow of the Vampire--which I feel is fresh and compelling. It is a fictional account of the making of the original German classic."
2,This Movie Was Too Creepy And Strange !,NOSFERATU was good but there was something wrong. Horror movies are supposed to be Creepy and Strange to a certain extent. NOSFERATU takes the Creepy and Strange thing to the limit and that is sometimes wrong. Other thing I didn't like about this movie was it was too much of a love story than a Horror Movie. I recommend this movie to anyone to who likes Horror/Romance movies.
2,"One of the most boring, overrated horror films","Hello? Doctor I have insomnia. Could you help me? Yes, watch Herzog's Nosferatu. I was cured and now I am able to get a good night's sleep. The pace of this film is tedious. The scenery is nice. So what? So is the scenery on National Geographic Explorer. One of my problems with Herzog is that he doesn't so much make films as much as he simply puts pretty pictures and scenes on film. This is not what cinema is all about. Herzog's Nosferatu fails the litmus test. Watch Psycho or Bride of Frankenstein or Halloween, then try to put this on. The inferiority of Nosferatu in comparison to those films is startling. If I want pretty pictures I'll go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I can't believe that people watch this and are entertained. Films are supposed to be gripping, enthralling, emotional. Horror films especially should be filled with suspense and a degree of the unknown. Nosferatu falls flat on all accounts."
1,The Worst Vampire Film I Have Ever Seen!,"When I watched the film, it made no sense at all. It was boring and way too weird to watch again. The music of the film is compeletely unbarable and I could barely understand the plot. Max Schreck back in 1922 did much better than Mr. Klinski. I critisize the film for being a bad representative of the Vampire myth."
5,Stop The Black Coffins,"I think the best thing about this film is that there are NO SPECIAL EFFECTS. it's all pacing and lighting. although you get both versions in the set, the German version is much better."
5,Excellent Film,"The best film presentation of the Dracula legend. Highly recommended for both quality and story line. This movie is not the typical Hollywood garbage, but a sophisticated re-telling of the timeless classic first brought to the public's eye by Bram Stoker."
5,"a great pegan to the original ""nosferatu"" and a very original take at the same time","the whole movie can be summed up in two words klaus kinski!! his take on the ""nosferatu""(vampire) is one so removed from most vampire movies that it really is strikeing in its tone. our vampire is one who has been one for so long that most,if not all,of the human qualities he had are long gone and he is little more than an animal(like the rats he keeps,and looks very much like). he never lets you take your eyes off him once you meet him!! he looks alone and lost in the castle when we see him and the only time we see any life(pun intended) is when he see's harker's wife's picture and in the last scene he has with her! if you get into it this tale will keep you glued to the set long after it ends! a very good film and the transfer is great."
5,Haunting and mesmerizing.....,"This remake is one of my favourite movies.It's surreal and just breathtaking. The camera work, costumes, the choice of locales...the music! Everything about it is beyond words. You must see it to understand. This is the kind of movie that makes me remember that cinema can be True Art."
4,Useful and well built.,"I have found many uses for this thing, crushing nuts, bread crumbs, etc. Does a super job on all types of meats.Probably will outlast me, typical Kitchenaid quality."
5,Best Chorus Pedal on the Market,"If you're looking for a chorus effect for your guitar, look no further! Visual Sound is all about making real effects for real people. I purchased this pedal 2 years ago and haven't bought another pedal since, theres been no need! The switch doubles the pedal's value by giving you two kinds of delay. I paid a friend of mine 80 bucks for his, and haven't regreted it yet! Purchase this pedal and you won't be dissapointed."
5,Buy this book!,"It doesn't matter if you never go to San Francisco -- buy this book just for the sheer joy of reading it. Bonnie Wach has real opinions and does not dish out the usual everything-is-great travel-guide drivel. Her writing sparkles with personality, wit and humor. All the particulars for the places she writes about are listed in the margins, making the information easy to find when you're looking for it. If you have any interest in San Francisco or travel books in general, buy this book."
5,My Favorite,"This is one of my favorite guidebooks to one of my favorite cities. Witty and funny writing style. Filled with interesting detail and juicy tidbits, yet at the same time simple to navigate. The approach is clever too - tailor made tours for a wide variety of perspectives and preferences. Even though I used to live in SF and know it fairly well, I've gotten so that I don't visit The City without this book."
5,Does what it should,Bought this item for a using with a new etec 130. My mechanic prefers to use fresh water through the intakes. So I researched a bit and found the dual feed works well. Found this unit on Amazon and thought it to be a fair price. Can't be easier as a Prime buyer to one click and it's done. Item came quick and in good shape. It works as advertised. I added a couple of plastic wire ties to keep the hose attachment supported behind the motor and I am very happy with the way it works.
2,Seems well made but doesn't fit,I have a 2006 Glastron DS215 with a Mercruiser 5.0 and Mercruiser sterndrive. Pretty standard configuration and very common. These things don't fit at all. They don't cover the intake holes and they don't make a good seal on the part they do cover.
2,"Great Film, bad transfer","It is amazing to me that Criterion would realease such a landmark film of the French Cinema on DVD, in this condition. The transfer looks great, the only problem is that the film is loose in the gate, causing it to jump and move in and out of focus. This tends to subside a little as the film progresses, but was very dissapointing to an ardent Bresson fan, and will be to anyone who enjoys Bresson's classic ""cinematography""."
5,Diary of a Country Priest,"Bresson's exquisite, quietly affecting study of a young priest's spiritual travails remains one of the great achievements of world cinema. Adapted from the novel by George Bernanos, ""Priest"" is decidedly minimalist in style, with Laydu's supremely restrained performance eliciting our empathy and subtly attuning us to his character's inner struggles. Bresson handles the details brilliantly, his unadorned elegance and intensity permeating the mood, set design, and action. ""Priest"" is a sublime film that will reward attentive viewers with a profound meditation on life, faith, and purpose."
2,a priest struggling with faith.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""Diary of a Country Priest"" with the French title of ""Journal d'un curé de campagne"" is one that I found to be boring despite my religious background. It took me four tries to finish the film without falling asleep.In this film a priest with health problems starts work at a church in rural France. Through his diary entries he reveals his crisis of faith and the way the villagers dislike him. He later befriends a priest in a neighboring village and learns that he has cancer.The film does have some nice scenery of norther France but that is about it.The special features on the DVD are a theatrical trailer, audio commentary by Peter Cowie, and the standard essay about the film in the liner notes.This film is recommend for those interested in the topic or for insomniacs."
3,Not satisfied!,"This was not my first Remmington shaver, but after going through 3 Smooth and Silky Plus Shavers and a Smooth and Silky Ultra (none of which lasted longer than 6-7 months with normal everyday use), it will most likely be my last. While I liked the shaver and it didn't cause skin irritation like regular razors, I find it VERY irritating that I have to plunk down anywhere from $45-$60 every six months for a new one because the motor dies! These are not disposable razors but they are produced to be such!"
2,"Doesn't cut hair well, unreliable design","This razor doesn't cut my hair well at all--even under what the directions list as ideal condition. It's completely hopeless on knees, etc.After two months of use, the rubber part at the base of the razor head began to shred itself. I looked into the provisions of the warranty. Note that while the razor does come with a two-year warranty, you need to 1. save your receipt, and 2. drive the razor to the nearest certified dealer. For me, the nearest dealer was an hour away--and I'm certainly not in the middle of nowhere.The battery life seems to be fairly good; I awarded an extra star for that."
5,Great electric razor,"I owned my previous Remington Razor for 30 years and finally decided it was time to upgrade to a newer model. Not because it wasn't still working - because it was! But, really only because I wanted a cordless model. The obvious choice was Remington since my last Remington worked so well for such a long period of time. I love this new razor even more than the last and recoommend it highly. It gives a great dry shave (I haven't tried it wet) and handles really well. The only downside I have experienced is that it won't hold a charge for more than 2 days without being put back in the recharge base. I took it on a weekend trip without the charger and by the time I got home it needed recharging (and I only used it once while I was away). Other than that, this is a great razor."
1,Not really good at all.,"My mother bought this for me because she has seen me struggle with so many different ways to remove hair. I have used Nair that burned me terribly, Nads that was a sticky mess, and countless others. This razor worked ok for the first shave, but it was just chewing my hair off. It was like the blades were dull out of the box. The plastic trim started to come off right away and it's so hard to clean. I needed a toothbrush to get anything out of it. Just not good at all. It is now collecting dust with all the other useless hair products. A very expensive paper weight. If only men knew how much trouble we go through just to remove hair."
2,WDF-5500,"The razor itself works great. But beware, when you try to order replacement screens and cutters, they don't make them anymore. Or if they do it is impossible to order. I tried to order the replacement part twice. The first time I ordered model #SP-360, but found out it didn't fit the 5500 model. Sent it back but did not get refunded for the original shipping charge. I then ordered #SP-132 replacement part and they sent the #SP-360 saying that replaces the SP-132. Again I will not get reimbursed for the shipping charge. I guess the WDF-5500 model is just too old a model to get replacement parts for. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,Not a good choice,"Despite its price, this was not a good replacement shaver for an older, noisy electric shaver. While it performs well when shaving legs, BEWARE as it is very rough on underarms (as the enclosed product brochure warns.) It will still be necessary to use two shavers. Additionally, the shaver head foil broke after less than a year. Back to using the old shaver."
4,coul be better,"my wife used it and complain about not to be a great for shaving frecuently, if you understan how women are, please let me know I am just typing"
4,Very Nice,My husband bought me a Remington last year...but a less expensive model. This one...a gift for my daughter...is much nicer!
3,"Not good, not bad","This shaver is essentially ""okay"". It functions and is durable but doesn't shave very closely. If anyone buys one, keep a package of disposable bladed razors on hand as backup."
3,Razor,So far it is very good. I have not tried it in the shower yet but dry it does a great job. Keeps a charge and last a while.
1,Polar CS600 is below average powermeter and bike computer.,"I have been using the Polar CS600 for 4 months and had several issues. First, the cadence sensor stopped working and Polar will not fix until they receive the old one first. This could take several weeks depending on your location. I loaded the software on my PC and it kept crashing my CPU. Overall, I rate this product poor do to the time to repair any warranty issues which are common in a new product. Perhaps, Polar should consider shipping out warranty replacement parts and then have the broken parts back in their packaging.Who wants to go without their computer for several weeks while its under repair?"
2,Power Meter Not Reliable!,"I have had the power meter Polar for a little over a month and I would NOT recommend this product. Firstly, the signal from the ""Power"" device to the computer is intermittent at best. I, therefore, do not know what my wattage for a given ride is... Yesterday, I tried to adjust the ""power"" device so that it would be closer to the chain and now it has failed completely. Now, I do not have neither power nor the cadence data. Additionally, in order to transfer the data from the bike computer to my laptop (which is only one year old) requires another device. Why can't it be USB capable? On the positive side the speed has been consistent."
5,Good Jumpers,"I purchased these after buying the store brought cheap cables that seem to last a winter or less. Well made good quality components and fast shipping. I should have got these years ago, worth every penny."
4,Get this series while it's still available...,"Oglio records was one of the early labels to bring us hard to find new wave 12"" singles on compilations, and few labels have managed to keep up with it. Get them before sellers start charging ridiculous prices for them. Only qualm about this volume is, if they were going to put a Bollock Bros song on-it should have been HORROR MOVIES!!!! Track times:1. music for boys (7:08)2. X ray eyes (4:24)3. Computer games (4:42)4. Universal radio (6:57)5. Harley david (3:51)6. In shreds (3:58)7. Seriously affected (2:50)8. Cruel to be kind (3:26)9. Eyes of a stranger (4:54)10. all roads lead to rome (3:51)11. Talk to me (4:05)12. nemesis (5:52)"
3,eh.,"It worked for less than a year--no better or worse than any other hair dryer I have had. The ""removable"" filter is a pain to take off, and then it is a pain to clean."
3,mia,another flag that I purchased for outside my work. This is a decent product and lasted longer than most of the US flags that flown with it.
1,Very poor quality,I had this flag two weeks before the bottom edge started shredding. I was sent a replacement. It is now six weeks later with the replacement flag and the bottom of the new flag is shredding/fraying. I live in So. Cal where there is no inclement weather. I would not buy another flag from this manufacturer.
3,Frayed in a short time,"I have flown this type flag for years, this one was up only about 3 months when the end seam tore off and the flag started fraying. The US flag that I fly with this still looks new."
2,Not enough details.,"It has a little more detail than the book you get when you buy quickbooks, but there are many many questions this book doesn't answer."
2,A ghost story?,"The (Grudge) it is not.Underwhelming acting, bad banter, most dialogs sounds as if they were reading it all straight line for line. Must had been all family and friends playing the parts, because there was not one good actor among them, I caught myself wishing the killing would start just so this could be over quicker. Totally homemade and cheap in so many ways. Nothing of interest happens other than an occasional appearance from the dark-haired ghost girl; also there are a lot of dark and hard to see scenes so be ready to use your imagination. The flashbacks were so un-necessary and we could have learned more if it were just told to us. The hand that rocks the cradle might be another flick they were trying to copy. This was no real ghost story, more of a coming to terms with her past story."
2,Not at all a good movie,"If you find it for rent for $1.99, go for it. Any more? Pass it by. Been done many times before in a better fashion. The acting is poor, the plot....well its been overdone by too many. I cannot recommend this movie unless you cant find anything at all else.Why doesnt Amazon add to its ""free"" movie offerings? I renewed my prime membership yet again but the new additions are few and far between. Amazon, if you are listening, provide some new ""free for Prime Members"" movies for goodness sake. You are making money hand over fist, pass on some of your profits to your best customers PLEASE!"
1,Horrible!,This movie is so awful. Cinematic technique makes it look like a low budget porno. The microphone has a frigging echo! The acting in community theater has more depth. Avoid this movie at all costs!
2,Worth a Watch for $1.99,"When I first started watching this film, I turned it off 5 minutes in after witnessing what I believed was some pretty bad acting (especially the father). Additionally, the filmography left much to be desired. However, being a hugh horror fan, I just had to give it a try the next day. I am glad I did. Although the only decent actor in the film was the young man who played the oldest son, the movie had some pretty spooky scenes. The ending was almost a tear jerker and set it apart from other movies in this class. All in all, it really was not a bad film. I have seen a lot worse."
4,good movie,"I liked the movie. at no time did i get thed feeling that it was leaning towards ""porn"". i did find the sound rather messed up and the dark scenes were exactly that dark, couldn't make out anything that was going on. for a budget of $30,000.00, and a first time director and staff, i'am pretty sure that they give their""100%"". the special makeup on thte kids was good.All in all, i'd rated it 40ut of 5 for trying."
1,The script and acting are ominous....,"this movie is like one of many hundreds that could have just not been made. Theres nothing new here, nothing groundbreaking. There are a couple of creepy scenes, but they are borrowed in concept from other, better, movies, i.e. The Grudge. The Child actors are the best thing about this movie, especially young Sean Patrick Flaherty, who shows some acting range and ability. The adult actors have less acting ability and range than those in commercials or porn. The father seems tranquilized. The adult scenes remind me of spending time at the house of a couple that you know are breaking up, just uneasy and uncomfortable, nothing scary or interesting, just uneasy. So, unless you are really bored on a desert island or locked up with this movie, find something else to do."
1,Just...Bad!!!,"Really, don't waste your money. I understood this was a B movie, but it's more like a Z movie. Ugh. Waste of time and money."
1,Ugh,"Most of the acting was terrible and way over the top. The movie has potential for being spooky but all of the atmosphere is nearly ruined by the poor sound quality and the constant over-use of echoes. Everything seems to have an echo except for the actors voices. The music, the sound effects, all end up sounding horribly canned with all the echoing. This movie is almost worth the rental price, but not quite. Hopefully the folks who made this film read this and take my feedback constructively. The children were better actors than the adults because they didn't over-dramatize things. I think sometimes people forget that there is a difference between stage and screen acting. You don't need the actors to work as hard because you have special effects that you can use in movies. If this were a stage production the acting may have been spot on."
1,Unwatchable,I turned it off. Thank goodness it was free with my prime account. I would have been upset if I had paid for this piece of garbage. Consider yourself warned.
5,china,"Well, I don't know how could I explain; first my english is very poor i'm writing from Peru(South America).Here there are people likes Red Rockers too,but we are small gang.I play guitar with my pals and I have a band, like amateur.I wish to get China's lyrics so I tried to get along the years but nothing.... I hope someone around the net wish to share with me .Thanks guys .Excuses about my grammar and English knowledge."
1,Buyer Beware,This product only works on the very old MACs that ran on the Motorola chip. I tried to install software to emulate the old operating system and was not successful.
4,I bought three different designs...,"But, again, I sure wish that they had some plan, calmer colors to choose from, but if you have an elongated toilet seat - they don't make the covers anymore. So, if you want a cover, and some color, these work."
5,Lovely music,"This is the perfect music if you want to just sit back and enjoy a good book, or maybe work on a light craft project, or even enjoy a nice soak in the tub. It's calm, relaxing, and soothing."
2,A Bit Ham-Handed,"There doesn't seem to be much subtlety to these pieces, unlike some of the other Tibetan and Crystal Bowl CDs I've purchased. She seems a bit ham-handed at times, with a resulting grating quality when the bowl is struck.Not impressed at all."
3,Half a loaf. But what a great half-loaf.,"Apart from a couple of filler tracks (""Action Now""), the first LP was brilliant through and through -- one of the best ""powerpop"" releases in the late '70s. That's the best reason to get this. Songs like ""Yellow Pills,"" ""Cheri,"" ""Tell Me Why (Can't Understand You)"" and most assuredly the album's buried treasure ""Jet Lag"" will quickly turn your heart to ashes.Unfortunately, it's the only reason. 20/20 never came close to repeating that magic again. On Look Out! (good advice), the boys seem almost ashamed of that initial success and move away from electrifying Britpop to a more generic rock 'n' roll sound that, quite honestly, sounded much like what everyone else was doing in the early '80s. On the second LP, only ""The Night I Heard A Scream"" comes close to the first LP. And that includes the two rare but generic B-sides added to this release. (Shame they didn't go after the outtakes from the debut instead.)"
3,Richard Blade and (the World Famous) KROQ!,"It was so random to find this album. I was doing a search for their song ""(If I Had a) Fast Car."" I didn't remember they even did other songs. ""Fast Car"" was the only song Richard Blade ever played. Now, if I can just find that song..."
4,Blast your way back to 1982,"Just dusted off my old vinyl copies of these albums and was instantly transported back in time. Riding around Los Angeles with 3 friends in my buddy's VW bug, looking for girls at party houses where Mom & Dad were out of town, drinking Coors beer, cranking this music on the hand-held tape deck. These guys played a dance at my high school then - I'll never forget them doing a ripping version of ""Pictures of Lily,"" a song that never sounded as good to me before or since. Or was it ""For Your Love?"" Ah, well...who cares?Despite all the good memories this stuff brings back, I honestly think it holds up pretty well. Great beats, cracking guitar sounds, sweet harmonies, cool lyrics. Wherever you guys are today, my hats off to ya for making my youth what it was."
4,A Real Gem,"Edwar Muir's guide is a very illuminating look into the fascinating social functions of Renaissance Italy, as looked at through the lens of Venice. He has many important things to say to both the historian and the anthropologist, whether interested in the Renaissance, Italy, or the nature of ritual in Early Modern Europe. Muir's analysis is well-written and helpful--a must for any serious student of the period, or anyone interested in a glimpse into the society of the period."
3,Good while it lasted,"I bought this as a replacement for another one that had quit working. Unfortunately they do not hold up well to dropping, as I just barely dropped this one from the counter and it stopped working. Otherwise the barrel is really nice and I like the buttons and controls. Too bad it just is not very durable."
2,Disappointed,"I am returning this iron. It gets so hot sometimes that the piece you press down to open it is too hot to touch. The temperature control and on/off buttons are placed in an odd place, causing you to often turn it off or decrease the temp when doing your hair.Finally, it just didn't curl my hair the way i needed it to."
3,"Pretty Book, Not Enough Identification","The book has clear vivid photos and a overview of all the catagories of Made in Japan collectibles but while she has the marks listed, far too many of them are not identified. There are 189 marks shown of which 101 are not identified. But nice pictures and well organized."
5,great reference book,This is a good tool for amateur or professional collectors - helps in identifying pieces and the history behind them.
1,A huge waste of time and $$$,"If it was allowed I would give this book a big fat zero. Alas, one star is as low as it gets. It skims over everything. Nothing practical in here. If you feel compelled to get this book buy a used copy. I am in the process of reading ""Start Your Own Business"" By Rieva Lesonsky which proves to be a great resource."
4,Fats live in 1965 (& 1968?),"Here are some fairly common live cuts from mid-1965 in Nevada, by the Fat Man. My ears tell me that the presumptive overdubbed audience is removed; we get a much cleaner sound.The big news is that a lesser known live set by Domino, reported by one source as actually live in New York City in 1968, is also found here, and many fans will be thrilled to hear the live ""You Win Again"" and ""Deep In The Heart Of Texas"".Fats!"
4,Jamborlee needs to check other sites.,"I just read the review from Jamborlee and I must say he or she really had no right giving it a 1,I gave it a 4 strictly because length was only 80 minutes.For Jamorlee you should do what most people did and that is look at other sites like deepdiscountdvd,on there site they listed it as revival show,.Amazon can not expect to be perfect although they come close.Plus if your unhappy with the dvd amazon will take it back and refund your money,try that instead of giving the dvd a review of 1,thats not really fair."
2,Trying To Keep The Welk Spirit Alive,"Sadly, Lawrence is now part of Christmas past but his family lives on! If you are a fan of the Lawrence Welk family and curious to see how they've aged -- this Dvd is for you. Old entertainers are like old athletes. Their best years are behind them. I'd label this product -- For Fans Only"
4,Great book for young kids,"My two year-old granddaughter loves this book! It's the first one she wants me to read to her when we sit down for our before nap or before bedtime reading time. I remember reading all the adventures of Lowly Worm, Huckle Cat,etc. to my kids when they were little and it's fun to share them again with their kids. I highly recommend this book!"
1,wrong part!!!,"bought some brake pads, they say it fits porsche cayenne 2008 base model! but it doesnt! im very upset with this seller"
3,Deserves credit,"This film is getting two stars on cable television, which I think is too little. I have read some of the professional reviews and think that they are sometimes hung up on the wrong things as well. I watched the beginning again tonight and was well surprised. I especially like the European feel of the movie. It moves along and events unfold as they would realistically in this environment. This film has been compared to Francois Truffault's 400 Blows and that is a pretty mighty comparison. Young girls know they must have charm and be pretty; boys are tough. This is not new. It may be a stark view in a luxurious part of the world - the Mediterranean - but adult figures are scarce. What would also add to the starkness of the film though would be adults who are paid to supervise the kids. Maybe nothing would be different even if so. People meet in a regard and maybe something comes of it and maybe it does not. The ballerina sequence to me was one of the really good surprises in this film."
4,Only One Movie,"the dvd i got only has ""paper man"". the price is right so i'm notcomplaining about getting the other movie."
2,Leave the hip hop to America please!,"I bought this album because I heard ""Colours Of Your Dream"" on Euro Trance Internet radio and assumed the rest of the album would bear some resemblence - it doesn't. This is the sort of music I go to great lengths to avoid here in the States.It is a combination of sugary pop songs sung by Isabelle Heitmann layered with kiddie rap by Thomas Nordin. This music lacks any kind of depth and might be suitable for pre-teens or early teens.I challenge any self respecting adult to listen to track six ""Sha La Long"" with ""Boom Boom Boom Boom everybody lets have fun"" repeated 50 times without seeking an immediate drink!I give this album two stars for ""Colours Of Your Dream"" which would greatly benefit from a few solid DJ remixes."
4,HP Deskjet D4160 Printer,I read the negative reviews about this printer and have found it to be a very good printer. I installed it without any problems and it has been working nicely for the short time I have owed it.
4,Great for my Mac,"I bought this printer to use with my iMac. It's fairly speedy and has good print quality. My only complaint has been that I have to restart/reboot it on a fairly regular basis. If not, it freezes up. I haven't been able to identify a cause."
4,Does not work with new Apple Airport Extreme n base station,Printer worked fine plugged into usb of macbook but does not work with Apple airport extreme base station. Talked endlessly to HP and to Apple to try to get it to work but no luck. Both companies pointed fingers at one another and were no help. Supposedly there are some other printers HP mostly that wont work. Seems functional otherwise.
3,Make sure to buy the ink in bulk,"Exactly that! BUY THE INK IN BULK! When you get down to one ink cartridge go out and get 10 more. Don't bother going to a retailer that gives you credit for bringing in your empty ink; they will tell you that they can't be redeemed because they are not empty. The cartridges get gummed up, even though the computer says ink levels are fine, that might be the reason why they stop working prematurely.Besides the ink issues, the drivers are very hard to install, but that is the case for many printers, and not HP specific, the canon I just bought was not vey smooth either. Windows XP handled the set up just fine.On the bright side, it is very fast when printing black and white, and the colors are very bright and the quality is great. The price is great for what it can do.b"
2,Highly unreliable,"Works wonderfully when it works: fast and crisp printing. Giving it two stars for the times the printer worked, HP's stellar cartridge delivery service, and decent looks.But constant paper jams guarantee make it unusual that I get anything printed in less than two tries. To make matters worse, the paper jams to not stop the printing process, spraying the printer internals with ink. The ink smears on the following pages or my hands. This happens with two or three different brands of paper and with included and pre-installed drivers on Mac OS X and Ubuntu GNU/Linux. Instead of a simple printer driver, included software installs a whole printing and imaging system including a bastardized photo manager and several utilities that duplicate services provided by the operating system. Paper handling mechanism is flimsy."
2,Use Plain Paper ONLY,This product is the WORST at printing on anything but plain paper. Forget card stock and labels -- it won't feed the sheet(s) right and it'll start printing above the form! I've wasted I don't know how many sheets of business card stock and label stock on this printer.
4,"Fast, Excellent Quality Printer","The HP Deskjet D4160 Printer is an excellent product. It's very easy to install (although there are a few seemingly unnecessary steps in the process) and its print quality is excellent. Although I primarily use it for printing black-and-white review sheets, records and envelopes, I sometimes use it to print color pages as well. I haven't had any problems with it for any of my purposes. It prints pages quickly and does a wonderful job on envelopes as well. I cannot comment on photo printing since I do not use it for that.Others have noted that there is a new version of this product available now. For small jobs, however, this printer is perfect. If you're like me and don't want to buy something that's capable of doing more than you'll ever need it for, this printer is the one for you. In summary: If you are looking for an easy-to-use, fast quality printer, check this HP Deskjet D4160 out."
1,This product is just terrible...,"I bought this printer to replace my old HP deskjet (an 800 series...), which had been faithful for the past 8 years. However, this 4160, from the start, was bad. First, like all the other review, it does use a ridiculious amount of ink. Second, the moment I installed it, it would constantly stall in the print queue, and would only print if I restarted the computer (as you can imagine, completely useless!). I called HP technical support, and after an hour on the phone, the said it was fixed (supposedly a firewall mix-up), but then the next day, same problem. I'm trashing it and buying a Canon, because on the HP website, there is an entire page dedicated to prints being stalled in the print queue...I suspect this is a common problem."
1,Avoid this printer like the plague,"Save yourself a headache, and don't even think about buying this printer. What an awful piece of garbage. Even when your ink cartridges are full, it will send you a pop-up message every three seconds (that is not an exageration) saying your ink level is low, and there is no way to stop these messages. You basically can't use your home computer unless you disconnect the printer. This printer is your worst nightmare right out of the box. Never, never, never buy HP -- check around on line and see what other people are saying: HP printers are absolute junk. Just do a google search on ""HP sucks"" and see how many hits you get!!! I tried to give this a ""zero stars"" rating, but one is the minimum possible."
3,Great litttle printer,"After much research, I finally decided upon this particular model. It doesn't use that much ink, which would have been a pet peeve, and you don't even need directions to hook it up and use. As far as an inexpensive inkjet printer is concerned, this one gets a solid three-star rating! You won't be sorry you bought it."
2,Mediocre for $80,"Text quality on Normal setting is good as would be expected.However, Normal setting for graphics SUCK THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF YOUR INK!!I printed 25 pages and ONE page at Maximum DPI (4800x1200). Do NOT use the Maximum DPI unless you plan on using 1/2 of the cartridge. It sucks up a lot more ink than it should for maximum.THe crispness of the images are fuzzy and not as good as the text. For the price of the printer, I'd expect the Used price range of around 50 bucks"
2,Not Satisfied,Basically I purchased this printer for my office for black and white printing. The problem I have is that for some reason it cannot print certain parts of each page clearly. Every page I print has the same problem in the same spot. I have tried to realign the toner but this problem is consistent and cannot get it to go away. Luckily I have another network printer that I can go to for printing that needs to be high quality. So I do not recommend this printer.
1,Disappointed,"The printer was not ""like new"" in fact it was broken and could not be used.Had to buy a new one!"
2,A JAMMER,"I got this printer because of the sleek, spiffy look...but I should have realized NO ONE is impressed by the shininess of your printer, and what's more, this one jams 40X more than my last printer, a Canon. I constantly find myself ripping pages out of the printer and hoping I'm not damaging the printer permanently. Anyway, wouldn't recommend it. It jams."
5,Intriguing musical complexity,"I had the pleasure of hearing Andy Narell live in an outdoor concert, not the usual steel drum performer I was familiar with. The tonal quality was incredibly subtle and well suited to his light jazz performance. Wonderful."
3,toner,"I like this toner, but the spray nozel does not spray the toner out which I thinks makes a difference. It trickles down my face, but if you get a bottle with a good nozel you will enjoy this product."
1,Didn't fit,"This was a nice case, but it didn't fit my phone. When I ordered it, I'm sure that it did not list that it was for the EU & Asia Pacific version phone. But if you have the US version - this product will not fit. Don't make the same mistake. The company did return my money, it took some time, but in the end it all work out."
1,Racist pamphlet,"Carleton Putnam, whose book can still be found in Nazi and racialist sites, defends racial segregation using biological premises. In short, blacks are intrinsecally inferior to whites, incapable of originating or even absorbing a ""superior"" culture. This book was trounced in 1961 by Garry Wills in National Review (which also favored some degree of segregation at the time, against Supreme Court decisions like Brown v. Board of Education) and, if read today, sounds still more grotesque. Its value, if any, is as an example of a kind of racist literature still current even after World War II, and written by a very articulated man. It can be used as a historical source, but not much more. So, if you are interested in American racialist thought, this can be useful."
1,There's a reason it is on sale,I found this item to be very cheaply made. It says it adjusts to different hair legnths and it does not. Do not waste your money on this shaver. The price was hot the razor was not...
1,NOT a Mustache Trimmer,"The packaging says it is a beard and mustache trimmer, and the ad said the same, but there was no mustache trimmer on the actual item. There are other models of the ""same' trimmer that do have both. I wanted a mustache trimmer and did not get it, and the company has not replied to my complaint."
4,Lookin' good so far ...,"One time through my beard and this Remington MB-35 is a pleasure -- particularly when compared against the Norelco AccuVac T870 that I recently bought (and have since returned for a refund). The Norelco unit wouldn't cut, it's battery wouldn't charge, and it sounded like a diesel truck.Hopefully this positively contrasting experience will continue through the years. I had great luck years ago with a Remington electric shaver, by the way (which lasted about 8 years of daily shaving ... before the current beard)."
3,Poor adjustment design,"I have had 2. Both suffered the same problem. The adjustment mechanism consistes of 2 plastic slides on each side controlled by the wheel. If you never take the guide off to clean it would probably work forever but, once you start taking it apart to clean and oil, the slided adjustment will not hold up the guide. The unit cannot easily be opened to repair. I try to buy products made in America and have usually love all Remington Products and own 3 shavers but this one needs to go back to the drawing board."
2,Not very interesting,"I can recall how I came to own this book but it is not destined to survive the next cull of my library. Aside from the fact that the product is rather cheaply put together, I didn't find much of interest in the recipes. I was struck by the unusual spelling of some dishes (Chicken Tanduri, for example) but then I noticed that, though rooted in Indian cuisine, the book is more about Indian cooking as exported by way of East-Africa. This is a fact that is not immediately apparent unless one happens to catch the brief reference in the introduction. The recipes do, at least, present their own custom spice blends rather than calling for commercial powders, but most are pretty pedestrian."
1,The Worst Book Ever To Set Foot On This Planet...,"Let me start off by saying, this is a very ""preachy"" book. It's horribly written, with cheesy remarks, and the stories are very predicable. I was laughing the entire time about how poorly written it was. It's the exact opposite if classic literature. It is trash. Please, please don't read this book..."
1,mislead by description should have read reviews,The description of the movie should read something like: Two selfish 30 somethings decide they hate themselves and their life choices. Instead of following through with their obligations they decide to quit their lives and others suffer for their indulgence.I truely felt mislead by the description for this movie. I am all for art house movies since they are usually the movies that change the business but this movie was just slow and plodding with characters I hoped would just hang themselves by the end but the only character to die was the only one worth saving.
2,Almost fell asleep.,"I wanted to punch everyone in this movie in the face: The main characters, all the extras, paw-paw, and I guess shirt-shirt as well. At times I was confused as to who the male/female main character was, as they had same haircut and body frame. From watching the trailer I had somewhat higher expectations, things could have been more interesting, but they just drag on, and on, and on. I vision Miranda July and Hamish Linklater working at Starbucks, not in theatrics."
1,Thoroughly Depressing With No Redeeming Qualities,"For the first 90% of this movie, I sat enthralled and thoroughly enjoyed everything about the movie - it was deep, witty, and full of surprises. But then Ms. July (who wrote, directed, and starred in multiple roles) decided to take a very bad turn which left me feeling thoroughly depressed and totally ruined all the previous enjoyment. It wasn't really necessary for the plot and didn't really match the mood of the rest of the movie, either. It turned it into one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies.(I don't want to give away the plot by detailing what I found so disturbing, but it'll be pretty obvious if you watch the movie.)Watch at your own risk..."
2,Failure to connect,"Failure to connect with each other, and with the relationships they try with others. Failure to connect with a pet who could have loved them. Failure to connect with her muse of dance. Failure to connect with their own futures, individually or together. Everything they do seems, somehow, to stop short of completion and fulfillment. In fact, I came out of this movie wanting to do something, anything, just to see something come to an actual finish.The few surreal moments - his stopping time, or her speeding through a whole generation in moments - stand out. Although enjoyable and useful to the story, they also stand somewhat out of place in this otherwise quasi-realistic narrative. Not a movie for everyone, me in particular.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
2,"Annoying, indulgent experiment","Okay, an annoying woman with an annoying voice also provides the even more annoying voice of a cat which is supposed to be adopted by her and her b.f. They have this theory that they can stop time. Also, they decide that the weeks prior to adopting said cat must be spent as if they were critical weeks. A bunch of boring stuff happens, but by that time, you may be asleep."
1,"No more Future, PLEASE","An 81-year-old fellow audience member at the 2011 Seattle International Film Festival said it best: ""What a self-indulgent bunch of crap...with BAD acting!""Actor/Director/Producer Miranda July (""Me and You and Everyone We Know"") has once again mystified me beyond belief: How does she get financing for these miserable projects? Boring scenes that creep by at a glacial pace are interspersed with an annoying little voice that supposedly represents an injured cat.Please join me in the hope that we are not plagued with another of Ms. July's atrocities in The Future!"
2,Hard to watch...,"I love Miranda July, and also Hamish Linklater. I loved 'You and Me and Everyone We Know', and was so excited when this came out. However, it was sad, depressing, disgusting, maddening, and hard to watch. I hoped there was a social statement of some type there when a cat died, but after reading every interview with Miranda I could find after this came out- there wasn't. It was just a matter-of-fact story about a very foolish girl who is influenced to the point of no return by the loose morals in today's society. Normally I keep all my movies, but this one I resold at a loss, because i knew i wouldn't watch it again."
5,living is just the beginning,I would give it five stars for just that thought. living is just the beginning something written down in some book somewhere on one of the shelves in the dust and rust of my own mind.If more people could tune in to this that we are only at the beginning....This movie I think helps point to that.
3,Bawled my eyes out for PawPaw!!!! *SPOILER ALERT*,"I thought this movie would be about how life changed for a couple that already adopted a cat... Not a movie about a couple who DIDN'T PICK THE CAT UP! Seriously started bawling my eyes out, as I have two cats of my own and couldn't imagine doing that!!Other than the sadness for PawPaw throughout the film, it was a bit interesting. I still don't get how he was able to stop time, but it was a unique film, to say the least."
3,The deleted scene was the best....,"Well, at least it was different. Cat's voice is a little annoying and hard to listen to. The movie is a little too ""out-there"" for me, but then she is a performance artist and definitely excels at it. I did watch the deleted scene just for kicks. It was brilliant! Hats off to Miranda July for that...should have been included in the movie."
5,great for literature circles,"I have used this book in literature circles with 6th grade students from collaborative to gifted. They all love the story! Even boys enjoy its adventurous side; however, they aren't as enthralled as the girls. Great read!!!"
4,Boston Jane: Start to a Great Series! XMMO,"This book is very funny. Though it has some romance, it's only a very small bit. She doesn't even kiss the guy! You see, she grew up in philadelphia, with the most annoying and proper person ever: Sally Biddle. Sally pestered her into going to a young lady's academy, and learning to be a proper lady. It was only after her education that she was called to go to the wilderness frontier to marry Dr. William Balt. It's hilarious when she tries to be the young lady that she was trained to be in a muddy, dirty, fleas infested cabin! This book is Adventurous and funny. It's a great read!"
4,"What an ""education"" is not useful for","I always seem to enjoy books for teens and pre-teens that include something about the things society deems important for people to learn and this is highlighted amusingly by Jane's going to school to learn to be a lady. Readers will delight in the tomboy Jane's prowess at spitting and throwing manure, while at the same time realizing that she does, in fact, need civilizing. Unfortunately, the education she receives isn't exactly one that fits her to live on the frontier in wild Oregon, where she is determined to go to pursue a childhood crush. It is the contrast between the ""learning to be a lady"" and the realities of life on the frontier that provide a good deal of the humor in the book. The added advantage here is that the picture of the primitive conditions is well researched and accurate.Interesting and fun, though probably not as deep as some treatments of this era."
1,Beware!!! This product is harmful. Do not buy!!!,I was consdering to buy these until I saw a statement under the product description. You click on the link that says 'Proposition 65 warning' :WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.Do not buy this product!
3,"good, not great.","My daughter isn't that excited about this toy. The picture does the product justice. The toy is ""no big deal"". The sounds of the balls are nondescript."
2,NOT the best bang for your buck.,"I bought this book as a novice in the rental business hoping to find information that would get me started out on the right foot. I WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED. I will not go as far as to say that this book is worthless; there are some useful tidbits of information that i found helpful, but there are other books out there that are so much better. I strongly suggest LANDLORDING, by Leigh Robinson (Ninth Edition or newer). It's available on amazon, of course."
2,Good Information For The USA,"On reading this book no matter how much I tried to focus I found myself wondering whether the content actually related to my own situation in the Uk.I purchased the book looking for straightforward advice on being a landlord covering aspects such as legal implications, inventory advice etc. However from the information I read on site it was not clear that this was very much a book for those in the USA. Once I started reading it soon became apparent when it spoke of the different laws for different ""states"", forms with ""zip codes"" etc. Whilst the general information was useful I felt that I couldn't rely on any document or legal advice as this might not hold for the UK.A good read but I felt that it should have been highlighted on the site that it was for the USA"
4,Probably the best book on SSL,"A fantastic book on SSL/TLS. Enlightened me with lots of information which I searched for on web but couldn't find.By the way, there is some mistake in the book.Page 48, Figure 3.3: The 'pending read state' is not copied to 'actual read state' upon receiving a change cipher spec(message number 6) from the client. Fortunately, it is correct in page Page 50, Table 3.6, step 6."
4,A PERFECT DARK,"THE SONGS OF THIS ALBUM ARE GREAT,ARE VERY WONDERFULL.IT'S SOUND IS DARK AND TETRIC WITH BAUHAUS INFLUENCES.IF YOU LIKE THE GOTH ROCK AND IT'S MUSICALS TEXTURES,IF YOU LOVE THE AFTERPUNK BUY THIS CD NOW."
5,I hope you are wrong,"I just read that a lady wasn't satisfy with their new Teflon Curling Iron, it didnt work as wall as the one she have previously. Well the one I have is the same and I purchased about 5 or 6 years ago, excellent, nothing beats this product. And believe me I buy everything I see in the market, just trying to replaced this one with another one before it breaks. So yes I hope you are wrong, cause I will need to replaced mine soon, the Teflon start to get black spot in some areas because the use."
2,not as good as i hoped,"It didnt work as good as the teflon curling iron i had a couple years ago, it works just as good as a regular non-teflon curling iron."
2,Draw Anime in only three almost impossibly hard steps!,This book teaches you almost nothing about the way to make the head shape- just exepects you to be able to make a perfect egg shape. Then it expects you to be able to magically draw perfect features. Then somehow it gets colored with perfect highlights and shading. I don't recomend this book at all for beginners or people with intermediate skills. ...
1,Not a very good Book to learn to draw in Anime format,"First off, I have taken a look at the book in a store. My first impression is that it was bad. One, the artwork looks very amateur like, more like a bad attempt. Many of the book he has produced are ones on how to draw american cartoons. Not to insult the guy, but it doesn't look anime like. I would not dare recommend this book to any one who want to learn how to draw in the manga style. I would sugguest buying the How to Draw Manga: Compiling Characters or the other How to Draw Manga. I suggest those because those are PROFESSION MANGA ARTIST. Please don't waste your time and money on Hart's books."
3,DANGER DANGER!,"Ok, this book isn't all that great, nor is it that bad. Its NOT a book for BEGINERS. I wouldn't recomend this book for a serious manga fan, because you will be HIGHLY dissopointed. Its not really manga, but more of a cross between western styled and cheap anime. The coloring isn't that great. Most of everything is western styles, and what actually resembels anime looks stupid. I wouldn't say this is a how to draw book. Its thick with loads of pictures, but it doesn't tell you HOW to draw them. Buy this book if you can learn from looking at pictures. I would suggest you buy something else. I must admit, it did improve my drawing, but not much."
5,excellent instructional book,I bought this for my daughter and she was so very happy to get it. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Excellent for anyone who wants to learn how to draw anime.
1,if you like manga and anime: do not buy this book,"as a fan of japanese anime and manga, i was really excited when my aunt bought me a book titled ""anime mania..."", but when i looked inside there was not a single picture that seemed like the japanese artwork that i enjoy. i was extremely disapointed. however, if you do like [imitations] of anime ... then you may enjoy this book and keep it under your pillow or whatever, even though it isn't even that good of an artbook in general..."
1,Anime Mania tres bon (Very good),"I bought it thinking it would just be a art book, but it has so much information on many aspects of anime. Though it's tutorials aren't as thorough as they could be, they are thorough enough to get the job done. I would recomend this book especially to anyone trying to learn to draw profiles. (The sides of peoples faces)"
2,Disappointed....,"I really love Chris Hart's art books and 'how to' art books in general, but this book is sub par for Chris.My biggest disappointment was the serious lack of 'how to' drawing illustrations actually included in this book. This book is comprised of mostly completed illustrations, and lacks the sort of detail Manga is famous for.The sections on 'head shots' is simplistic, the line quality heavy, and the color unspectacular. To make matters worse, over 3/4 of the book is filled with finished drawings. If you are the sort of artist who learns by looking at finished illustrations, this book is for you. However, if you were looking for a 'step-by-step' approach, this book would be a poor choice.I recommend reviewing this book before purchasing."
2,Not very good at all....,I admit I've only browsed through this book at a bookstore.. I didn't buy it because I didn't find it to be worth paying for.The drawings don't look very... how should I put it? Well done? They look like they're done by a beginning artist. They're not what I'd expect as far as traditional anime goes. I'm a fairly good artist myself looking to hone up on my skills. This book wouldn't be that much help to me at all in that respect.Maybe I just expect more out of a book that's supposed to be teaching you the proper way things should be drawn? :)
2,"Very ""Westernized""!","When I bought this book, I was expecting a good ""step-by-step"" & ""how-to"" book. This book REALLY disappointed me! >.< I found that the drawings in the book were VERY ""cartoony"" & ""western"" looking. The drawings were all very generic & simple. Looking back at certain illustrations, I can hardly say that it looks like anime! I'm sure that this book will be promising for younger readers, but a failure to hardcore otakus! o.OI own many manga comics & ""how-to's"", & I recommend the ""HOW TO DRAW MANGA"" series. They will give you a good start to manga drawing. Looking for a first manga series to read?? Try ""Fruits Basket"", by Natsuki Takaya. ^_^"
1,The worst Manga Mania book yet!,Yes millions of anime fans hate his Manga Mania because he can't do the art right and they hate his books because he hires people to do the art for him but........THIS IS THE WORST YET! Last year one of my friends showed me this book. I felt like laughing Chistopher Hart really doesn't know what anime is! He hired the worst people yet! There is like only two or three good artist (one was the one the one that did the front)and the rest of them were terrible.Most of the book is terrible mabye like ten pages are good but the rest how sad! Even if this books cover looks good don't judge a book by its cover.
3,okayyyyyyy,"I got this book when I was just finding out about the anime/manga world. I now realize that this book is more for begginers. not a very good beginer either. it has a lot of useful info, though.( weight bearing leg, basic body construction, character design, and other suff) however, this book is sort of confusing becouse there are lots of different art styles in here.(Mr. Hart hires other artists) different artists draw differently.there ARE colored illos all over the book. Mr. Hart breezes through lots of different types of characters without getting into them that much. he just shows you how to draw them at one angle and moves on. he could write a detailed series based on this book( how to draw creatures, how to draw high-tech punks,dramatic seens, how to draw special effects, etc.).but if your a begginer and want an overview of anime this is the book for U."
1,A Disgrace,I would never recommend this book to anyone who takes the Animee/Manga world seriously. This book is a joke. How can I possibly learn to draw these objects with such a confusing format?If you buy this book you will be sorry. This book is a disgrace to the art of Anime/Manga cartooning.
5,Excellent,My drawing has already improved greatly after reading this book. The techniques explained are not to be ignored! This has pushed me over the hump to the next level in my craft. Good balance of storyboard sketching to full blown finished pictures.
2,Condition of book was most disappointing.,"I have read portions of this book before and wanted my own copy. When this specific book arrived I was stunned that it had been described as in ""good"" condition. The cover was worn with stains on it as well. I would have preferred a more honest description so I would anticipate a worn and soiled book. Not happy with my purchase."
1,latin musak,"This is latin musak, not latin jazz. If you want latin jazz, try Pancho Sanchez, Chucho Valdes, Cal Tjader; but don't waste your money here. Mr. Obiedo's music lacks variety in the rhythm section; the percussion lines could have been (perhaps were) laid down by a drum machine. If rhythm isn't the essence of latin jazz, or any jazz, then nothing is. Mr. Obiedo has lost his latin soul."
4,Ideal for me,"For an amateur UNIX/Linux C programmer like me, this book is avery good introduction to OpenGL. I have bought several graphics books,but Angel is the only author I have come across who hastaken the trouble to provide a makefile to ensure his readerscan actually compile any program. Once you can do that, youshould be able to teach yourself with the guidance from the book.If you have trouble understanding dot products then you cannotblame this book if you find it hard. Ultimately you will onlylearn OpenGL (or any programming) by experimentation. Don'texpect to read any single book and become an expert overnight."
1,Do not waste your money,This is the worst book I have ever read in the topic of computer graphics. The excercises do not reflect the knowlegde you gain by reading the chapters. Do not waste your money by buying this book.
1,"Confusing, Sketchy explainations, bad wording of exercises","Do not get this book. The explainations are Ok until you get to the exercises when you realize that much of the subject was not explain. The exercises are worded poorly. I spent more time trying to find out the problem asks than actually doing the problem. Poor grammatical usage...author uses personal pronouns (she, her, ect.) rather than using gender neutral sentences. This is very anoying to read."
2,Why this book is used for an Intro Class is beyond me.,Dont buy this book if you are wanting to lern how to program openGL. Buy it if you know openGL and want to learn how it works.It is not a book for the openGL newbie. So why many teachers use it for an intro to Graphics Programing class boggles the mind. Angel explantions of theories are hard to follow at best. In one chapter he spends an whole large section explaning the theory behind a lighting model then states that openGL doesn't use this method for lighting. So why even cover it in an openGL book?? This is less a book about openGL and more about 3D modeling and lighting theory in general.
1,"Lots of theory, very little code.","I am currently enrolled in an OpenGL course and we are using this book. I think it is absolutely useless. It is definitely one of those ""and the rest is left to the student as an exercise"" type books. If you like a lot of theory and mathematics, get this book. If you want to see some real examples of OpenGL, get the ""lego"" book."
1,run screaming to a real graphics book,This is a terrible textbook to get if you want to actually learn something. I had the bad luck of having to use this as the text for a class and am thankful that I had Foley & Van Dam for a backup. Get that if you want a book that talks in depth(and with authority) about graphics.
2,Did not condition my leather couch,"I used this product on an Ikea pigmented/finshed leather couch and it did not condition it at all. The couch started to crack and peel after a few months of use after applying this product. There were no signs of cracking or peeling before. I think, this product may have hastened it by actually drying the leather. I'd stick to a real leather conditioner than this all-in-one cleaner/conditoner. Why still the two stars? To be fair, I never used it for car leather upholstery, for which it is targetted for."
5,smooth jazz,"Accomplished musicians finesse the music. The tunes are dense, interesting and arranged. There are solos, but it is not just a case of, ""head, solo(s), head, out."""
3,Middle of the road fantasy,"Enjoyed reading the book. Written simply which makes for a simple and fast read. Decent character development, although fairly one dimensional in their portrayal. Interesting mix of fantasy magic and modernity."
3,Are We Having Fun Yet?,"Entertaining but too confusing. I'm not sure that a world where Christian priests works side by side (or even coexist) quite holds up. I'm glad the chaplain worries about the welfare of the wizards and the bishop fears that the wizards will corrupt the chaplain. But the book can't seem to decide whether it wants to be funny or serious, and most of the funny parts aren't funny enough. I figured out pretty quickly that the gift of youth would have to have been draining the king's life, but I couldn't grasp the motive. Lady Marie seems too silly and shallow and not worth dying for. Is this supposed to be a religious book? Underdeveloped characters, except the Duchess. OK story but not more than mild entertainment."
4,Extremely Disappointed,"My review is not directed at the product itself. I previously owned the CD-""Last Look"" by Torcuato Mariano, which was stolen from me some time ago. I was very excited to find a seller (wherehouse) whom I could purchase this particular CD again, especially since the CD has been discontinued by the manufacterer. I purchased the CD, waited a couple of weeks in sheer excitement of recieving my purchase, only to be told a day or so before the shipment was to arrive, that the seller could not send the purchased merhandise to me. ""WHAT A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT"". I have made many purchases with Amazon and never have I encountered something like this. Oh! my money was refunded, thank you I might ad but I would rather have had the CD."
5,Superbe album,"A mon avis, l'un des meilleurs albums de BOY GE MENDES, Musique subtile et précieuse, remarquablement interprtée sur des compositions magnifiques."
2,To Much Politics,"This book started off good, with the opening of the stadium and the first home run hit by Babe Ruth to christen the stadium. But after the first two chapters the book becomes to involved with the politics and the businessmen behind the stadium and its players. This book did not keep me entertained while I read it, and I found myself many times struggling to turn to the next page."
2,Jazmin's Tricky Review,"The Diamond in the Bronx is a verryy ticky book. It leads you to believe that it's all about the Yankee's and the stadium; the history behind it. When really it's ALLL about politics. The first couple chapters are interesting because they have history on how Dodger Walter O'Malley had his desire to build the Yankee stadium. The book then goes into detail on how the stadium affects the politics of New York. Making it complicated for race and wealth to be apart of the stadium, since the stadium was located in the Bronx; one of the boroughs that have more ethnic people rather than caucasians. It was also a question that if the stadium was taking money from ""more important things"" like transportation, and city neecessities. If you're more of a baseball, stadium fan, this book in not for you, however, if you are a politics fan, GET THIS BOOK!!!!"
5,Well made flag and outdoor durable.,It's the perfect size for standard outdoor decoration. Bright colors and accurate to military code. I would recommend this for anyone wanting to proudly display the Marine flag.
3,$$$$$ Shipping,"A $2 flag with $5 shipping. Minus 1 star for that. Very thin fabric with the Marine logo only on one side. Minus 1 star for that. Still, my flag looks great from far away and I am not too unhappy. My next flag will be with proper printing on BOTH sides though. I will have to pay $25 for that one. Semper Fi"
2,Pass,"Not sure if I am reviewing the same flag as some of the other folks here but the one I received was POS(Marines know what I mean). I am more proud to fly my Marine flag under Old Glory as any other but this flag was ""unsat"". First, it was missing one of it's 2 grommets which didn't matter cause I lost the other in the first ""wind"" that came along. Only thing holding it together after that was the grommet I put in but was hanging by 1 of it 3 threads. They shouldn't be allowed to put the EGA on something so cheap. My advise... spend a few dollars more and get a flag you can be proud to put on your flag pole."
4,Good quality for low price,"Ordered this for my 81-year old father's birthday. Mom said that she was very much in approval of the quality for the price. It was also shipped promptly and within the estimated date range. Great deal, great service!"
1,False Advertising,"The 3 X 5 Marine Corps Nylon Flag that is .99 cents seemed ""to good to be true"", but heck why not since it was .99 cents. Well the description did not tell whether it was two sided or not. It came only one sided and not to surprised, but the description actually said ""DuPont SolarMax[tm] Nylon "" and it came polyester. They did ship actually pretty quick and was happy with being able to return the flags, but was going to have to ""eat"" the $22 dollars in shipping and spend another $5 dollars to return them. It's one thing for me or someone else to try something out for a dollar, but when your straight lied to, well...I review the good and the bad and this definitely fell in the ""bad"" category. At least I can still use them and I will fly them proud, but Seven Bros surely took the ""Semper-Fi"" out of this deal.Mark"
1,peteh,"This flag sucks. It's two pieces of cloth that you can see right through, so you see a reverse image of the marine emblem from both side. I didn't even bother to hang it."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This flag is a disgrace to what USMC represents. I wrote the vendor on this and they stated that they have not had any problems it must be the sun shining through on a bright day. I have not written any reviews but I had to let fellow Marine's know about this. This is a two piece flag and the pieces are not aligned correctly, terrible. Do not purchase even for $1.00"
2,"Not Nylon, Not made in USA","I recently purchased this for my father for his birthday. He likes to show his respect to my career path by flying this in his front yard. The one he has now is tattered and not worthy of being flown. He requested that the new flag be made of Nylon and be made in the USA.When he opened it, it said that the flag was made of polyester and made in Taiwan. So much for that.The flag itself is great, but it's not made like it's listed above."
1,Terrible Product,"This is bad! After reading other reviews for similar products, I thought: ""How could anyone complain about a $10 nose hair trimmer?"" I mean, come on... Plus, how could Remington be succesful if they sold products that don't work? Now I understand. This product does not work, does not cut your nose hairs, and it smells terrible, like oil, from 10 feet away! I only hope that Amazon will take it back, since I had to destroy the package to open it."
5,Nose & ear trimmer,Product works very well. Am very pleased with the results and ease of use.Imhighly recommend it.
2,"bowie, yes",the bowie and crosby duet was wonderful. I looked everywhere for it.The rest of the cd was o.k.But for the duet it was worth the money.
3,loose Eartha Kitt,"I would have given this cd 10 stars if possible if Eartha Kitt's Santa Baby wasn't on it. That is one of these most overplayed/overhyped songs.That being said, I bought this cd for the David Bowie/Bing Crosby duet. That is one of these best duets ever. I could listen to that song along over and over."
1,Perfect for catastrophic data loss,"This drive worked beutifully in the first 6-8 months, regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the PC. After I trusted it for all my work and research data backup, done just once every month, it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working. After extended agony with the customer support, I got no understanding or even the will to help or just listen. Surperisingly, when I talked about this subject with some of my collegues in our University, I discovered that many of them, in defferent departments, suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives (USB/Firewire).After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk that I trusted with my work, I can say for sure, Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage. We've been there."
1,"Computer cannot detect it, WD doesn't care and won't fix it.","I bought this HD, I've regretted it ever since. The power cord connector of the drive is bad, and the computer rarely detects that the drive is connected even when the power connection works. I have to plug it in and unplug it dozens of times before XP knows it is there. WD customer support would only send another power cord, which wasn't the problem at all and didn't change anything. This drive is a waste of money when there are much better choices available."
4,Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer tinted moisturizer,"I got tired of paying a lot for Merle Norman's tinted moisturizer, which kept shrinking in size but expanding in price, even though I had used the product since I was 16, and that was a long time ago! I'm loyal to a good product, so it was tough to switch. However, couldn't afford MN any more, so I tried this based on an article/recommendation in a magazine, and I'll never pay $35+ for an ounce of tinted moisturizer again! Great product. Nice light coverage with good SPF and easy on delicate and sensitive skin like mine. Both this color and the lighter ""10--Ivory to Fair"" fit my pale skin tone. Can't recommend it highly enough .The only bad thing about it is that you have to pump it a bunch of times to get the first dollop to come out and when you look at the bottom of the container, it looks like you have pumped about 1/4 of the moisturizer out of the bottle into the cap. But it turns out fine."
4,Great product with a few weaknesses,"Bought this because winter dryness was affecting the delicate skin areas around my mouth.Pros:- I have very acne prone skin and this does not break me out even when I use it every day- Gives me a matte look all day, perfect for oily skin- Impressive ingredients list- Only one pump is enough to give sheer, even coverage to 2/3 of your faceCons:- I believe the color does darken once it sets. The Ivory to Fair color looks perfect on my skin until it dries... then it's a shade darker and a bit too pink for my neutral skin tone.- Not moisturizing enough for my winter skin.Would buy again if I can find a shade that dries to match my skin tone."
2,Burned my skin something terrible,"This foundation doesn't work for me, I must be sensitive to the ingredients. I used it twice, the first time I noticed a little burning on my face and the back of my hand where I apply it from. The second time my face was burning, red, swollen and blotchy and my hand was blistering. If you have sensitive skin stay away from this!As a foundation it's rather light and provides light coverage, it's not really buildable at all because it gets cakey.I've used a lot of neutrogena products but this one is a very big miss!"
3,Good...but not for oily skin,"This moisturizer was too oily for my already oily skin. In the summer heat, it felt like it was sliding off my face the way heavy foundation will in the humidity.This had been recommended to me because of my acne-prone skin apparently since it includes a retinol, but since I already use a benzoyl peroxide product during the day and I'm not supposed to combine retinol and benzoyl, I had to return it.Also, the shade I got should have matched my skin based on my use of other Neutrogena make-up products, and the Ulta salesclerk agreed on the color I chose, but when I actually applied it, it looked much too dark and way too yellowy for my skin.It didn't work for me, but if you have dry skin, and the color matches it, it might be a really good choice for you, since it does apply very smoothly and smells okay."
3,Stains Clothing,"This product goes on smoothly and doesn't emphasize lines or pores. But I won't buy it again because it stains the necks of my shirts, and I can't get the stains out even with pretreating."
4,"Good product, but STRONG smell!","This moisturizer is what I've been looking for--good coverage that evens out my skin tone (I have acne and mild rosacea) and provides some sun protection. The only issues I have is that is has a STRONG sunscreen smell (so my husband always knows when I wear it) and that it rubs off very easily. (But then again, this is just a tinted moisturizer and not a ""real"" foundation.) I like to wear light coverage in the summer and to help avoid breakouts, and this fits the bill since I can hardly feel the layer of makeup when its on!"
3,it's good for dry skin,"I think this cream is very good for dry skin. My skin is very dry. With this cream, I feel my face become more smooth."
3,Not very hydrating or natural looking,"Two things I really like about this are the sun protection and how smooth my skin feels after using it. I'm not so happy about the clear packaging, I'm not sure the retinol and the vitamins remain stable. And even though it's very sheer it is still somehow noticeable. It leaves a gray-ish cast that makes my complexion look dull. Because I want to give it another chance (there aren't that many day creams with so many benefitial properties) I purchased the lightest shade and I hope that by mixing both shades I will get a better match for my skin tone.So even though it's sheer don't expect it to dissappear on your skin and make sure you find a good color match."
5,Makes me look years younger!,"I am generally a huge Neutrogena fan and use many skin care products of this brand, and the Healthy Skin Enhancer has now become one of my favorites!The tint is only very light, so this is not to cover scars or any other skin perfections, but it gives my skin a nice ""glow"" when I put it on in the morning. When I get up in the morning, I usually look tired, no matter how long I slept, and especially when I am not tanned, it's worse. This product leaves a very smooth sensation on your skin, and it's just the perfect combination of a light tint and skin moisturizer. I use it every day and I think I am addicted to it ;)"
4,replacement unit.,"I bought this sensor because the arm of the sensor (the one that sense the wheel speed) broke. So it's a replacement.the sensor works fine, it's gets the cadence and speed well and communicates fine with my Edge 705. My only recommendation: Careful with that arm, it may brake."
5,Excellent interface - also talks to Trek ACH Digital,"Purchased this device to synch with my new Garmin 310XT. Turns out the ANT communications simultaneously works with my Trek bike computer - which is sweet! So, I could use my Trek HR monitor strap and get rid of the temperamental Trek sensors (that wouldn't talk to my Garmin). The beauty is that I can monitor cadence, speed and HR on the Garmin and the Trek simultaneously. That means faster transitions from swim to bike to run since I can just keep the Garmin on my wrist.Nice to get unexpected ""features"" when buying a product."
4,Cadence/speed sensor,A good buy and does what it's supposed to do. Sync with my Garmin 305 was very simple. This is my second one.
5,Great Cadence Sensor,This is my second purchase of this sensor. I liked the first one so much I put another on my second bike for use with the Garmin 800. 10 minute install and set up. No wires to route. Love it.
3,Design could be improved,"The design could be improved upon as you need to have a magnet on both the crank arm and the spoke within 5mm of the sensor. This makes id difficult and may require some minor modifications on some bicycles (I needed to add a spacer between the crank arm and the magnet). Too much tilt towards the crank, risks having the arm of the sensor being caught in the spokes after a large bump on the trails or raod. I have known of other people being able to purchase a larger magnet to the inside of the pedal screw which allows the sensor to be farther appart. Other than that, it works great with the Edge."
1,Not waterproof,"I'm on my second unit. Both suffer from water intrusion. I cut away the plastic housing so I could see what was making the sensor fail and sure enough the circuit board had lots of corrosion after I washed my bike. The second unit I try to seal using silicone in the battery compartment, wheel speed screw hole, and wire hole for the wheel speed reed switch. To no avail it somehow still got water inside the unit and is now failing.If you use your bike only on an indoor trainer then you can purchase this unit, if you go outside you are wasting your money.EDIT:I was able to seal up the unit better with the third unit using household silicone. So far so good. If you buy this product you will need to seal up the battery compartment, the sensor wire hole(remove screw from wheel speed sensor and pull apart), and the wheel speed sensor screw itself.I really like the dual sensor once it gets sealed up."
1,speed senson review,"Too bad no speed sensor for Garmin 450T. Useless for Mt Biking without it. Hard to fit on carbon cranks with enlarged carbon chain-stays/rear triangle. I got it to fit but without speed, i have no use for it."
3,Works well... isn't necessary,"I bought the speed/cadence sensor thinking that having the information for the cadence would give me more insight about my riding performance. It really just let me know that I nearly always ride at the same cadence and I already was getting my speed information from the GPS and a speedo on the bike already.If you don't have a speedo on your bike, this is a decent product. I however would not have bought this if I knew that I wasn't going to get more useful information out of it.Construction is good, it assembles together easy enough. I can't complain about its performance, just its usefulness."
1,Speed sensor not working,"The Garmin 305 works great, but I can't get the speed sensor to work without GPS. I've had the unit for about a week. I checked the magnet with my old Cateye. I will have to contact Garmin for a replacement."
5,Install easy with a little help,"The unit moved a little after a few hundred miles of vibration. I reinstalled it with double stick tape under it and so far so good. Great care must be taken when doing this as once it sticks, it is stuck. So I was glad to try it out first to check it out, and then mark its location on the bike and carefully reinstall it with the tape. As has been said before the lights cannot be seen in the daylight, so move the bike in the garage to check the cadence.I lost the magnet too but the local bike shop to the rescue."
5,Garmin's 2-in-1 is great,"The cool looking little Garmin device that monitors wheel speed and cadence is a great 2 in 1 device. Extremely easy to install and adjust to fit your bike. No wires. Simple to ""reset"" for a new install."
3,"Easy to install, easy to knock loose","Like all cadence sensors I've used before, it's easy to knock it slightly loose so that it doesn't register the cadence magnet. Kind of a nuisance, that. I've heard that if you substitute a rare-earth magnet on the crank these work better, but I haven't tried this."
5,The Best Training Device Must have,The sensor is easy to install with the zip ties that they provide for you. Easy to pair with my Garmin 405. Within 45 mins of opening the package I was on the road training. This is a must have for anyone serious about improving their technique and is ideal for those seeking a way to truly learn gear management on the road.
5,I like it!,"I found the installation and setup to be quite easy. The data proved to be accurate on my first ride utilizing my 405. I haven't exposed mine to water yet, but based on previous reviews, I will be sure to bag it when I wash the bike (seems like an incredibly simple solution)."
4,It really works,"The only thing I wish it was different is the the way the product is fixed.The stripes are ok, but be carefull to do it once... otherwise you'll end like me seaching all the cabinets at home to find spares.But it works well. I could test it right after installation and it does what it has to do."
5,Works great on rear wheel.,"I bought this sensor to go with the Garmin Forerunner 305. It works great. It installs on the rear wheel, so we can use it on a bike trainer during the winter season here in the Northeast. Very easy to sync up to the Forerunner 305 - just tell it you have that accessory and it recognizes it."
4,Workded on 2nd bike AFTER update to 3.3 software on Garmin 705,"I purchased the Garmin GSC 10 to put on a second bike (Garmin Edge 705). Installation was easy enough and the cadence and speed passed the test (flashing green and red light on sensor) so I had no reason to doubt that it wouldn't return. However, about 1 month later when I went for a ride on the bike with the new sensor, my Garmin Edge 705 would not register cadence. The Garmin Edge 705 would not pair with the new GSC 10. I checked my other bike and it worked fine with the GSC 10 on that bike. I decided to write to Garmin about this ""defective"" GSC 10. The online form asks for software version which I wasn't sure of. When I checked the software version, I realized that version 3.3 just came out on December 10. I updated the software and now the GSC 10 on each bike works perfectly. The software history did not say it fixed any problems with pairing a second GSC 10 but it fixed the ""problem"" nonetheless."
3,Don't Buy If You Have An Irregular Bike Frame(Chainstays especially),"I used this product for many years successfully on my Cannondale R600 road bike, but I recently purchased a new triathlon/TT bike(Quintana Roo Caliente) and now the cadence sensor is too far away from the crank arm to work properly. The rear chainstays on new bike are narrow near the bottom bracket and curve out as the go towards the back axle(for aerodynamics). The distance from the chainstay is a couple inches from the crank arm and I would need a 2 inch block to get the crank magnet close enough to the sensor so it reads. So make sure that your cranks are fairly close to your chainstay if you want the cadence to work. The speed sensor works fine so riding on the trainer tracks my speed ok."
5,Excellent Product,I really like this product. I like not having wires drapped around the bike. The tradeoff is that it requires a battery.I am using it with the Edge 705. I really like the data that is provided by the device. The speed / Cadence sensor is great when the bike is on the trainer as it is located on the back wheel.I am totally satisified with the device. I purchased it on Amazon. I am happy with the price that I paid compared to other sites. It showed up when promised. And worked as advertised right out of the box.
4,"Does the job, but not very durable.","I got one of these with my Garmin Edge 305 Cycling GPS system and mounted it on my road bike. It works very well and seems quite accurate. This second one is for a stationary bike I have.My only problem is that the first one I got has cracked on the speed sensor arm where the screw is that holds it to the main unit. So far it is holding in place, but it won't take much to break it loose. No speed sensor would only be a problem on a stationary bike since the GPS can calculate speed on a moving bike. Cadence is what I really wanted this for to begin with.Since the speed arm seems fragile, I don't think I would recommend using this on serious mountain bike rides."
3,Attaches easily to any bicycle; NOT EVERY BIKE!!!,"The Tech Details for the GSC-10 states ""Attaches easily to any bicycle; 1-year warranty"" Many retro or comfort cycle owners should verify there frame will allow alignment of the three parts to attach properly. The spoke magnet has to align with the GSC-10 sensor, not a problem.On my Electra Townie, a comfort class bike, the pedal crank arm is located too far forward to allow alignment of the third sensor. The pedal crank arm magnet is required to align with the GSC-10 and the spoke magnet in order to measure your pedaling strokes per minute.It is not critical for operation, but you will be unable to measure your pedaling strokes per minute. Although a general road touring cyclist, I did purchase the unit and the Edge 705 in order to measure everything I could. It was disappointing to learn AFTER the fact that I will miss a key measure."
1,Speed/Cadence sensor,I would never recommend the speed/cadence sensor. I found this sensor to be of extremely poor design as it does not fit my bike at all. I had to create a makeshift inch block out of electrical tape and tape it to my pedals for the sensor to even reach the signal. Additionally the sensor itself is so sensitive that even the slightest touch will completely turn off the sensor. I am extremely disappointed as I bought the watch/sensor combination specifically so that I could have all of my readings on one computer screen and have essentially wasted money.
2,Spoke Magnet design is problematic,"I am going on my 5th replacement magnet, as it seems the plastic screw-in piece that clamps the magnet to the spoke does not hold up very well. I had two of them fall off when riding at speed, then I noticed the third one had begun to crack so I removed it before it fell off. The 4th on, I used some liquid tape to keep it snug, and it worked for a couple of months, but now it, too, is cracking. I use it on an aluminum frame road bike and it seems the combination of speed and vibration are more than it can handle. They need to include a metal thread on the plastic clip so you can screw it down tightly and maybe use some Locktite. I've spent like $50 on replacement parts since buying the GSC 10."
3,Need New Design,"Need to change the design. My bike crank arm is a little bit far from the frame. When I install the unit, I need to bend the unit to be able to get the 5mm distance on the magnet crank arm. Garmin need to change the design and put another adjustable arm like the arm for the speed, so it can be adjusted and not forcing the unit to be near the magnet crank arm. The rubber of the unit should be adhesive so it will not move once strapped. The provided plastic locks are not a good quality, very hard and won't follow easily the curve of the crank arm and frame. The lock can loose quickly so buy a good quality plastic lock to make sure you won't loose the cadence/speed unit on the road. One reviewer already lost his unit but luckily another biker found it and return to him. As for the battery, I got no problem for now. Unit easily recognize by Edge 800 and love the cadence and speed charts recorded on the website only the design should be changed."
4,Cadence sensor works great!,Ok so I purchased this to track my cadence with my Garmin 910xt and it works great! My only complaint was the lack of instructions to install on my bike. There were available but inadequate imho.
4,A must for indoor bike training,Without this you will not be able to accurately use your indoor trainers and get good readings. Definitely a must to calibrate it so your results are as close to accurate as possible but a wonderful accessory for you Garmin Forerunner 305.
1,Poor Quality,The unit that I purchased di not work - light wouls not even come on when reset button was pushed
1,Never got this item from Amazon,Any convenience of ordering went right out the window when Amazon chose to send my package by USPS. They (USPS)said i had moved and I had not. Had i known they were sending it USPS I would have put my p.o. box in the address. As we know many vendors will not deliver to PO boxes so this matter NEEDS TO BE CLEAR WHEN PURCHASING WHAT CARRIER IS BEING USED. I work full time and cannot spend a lot of time figuring out WHAT AMAZON IS GOING TO DO WITH MY package. I ordered two similar items from ebay which came almost immediately. ebay didn't have the other accessory but AMAZON did. otherwise I would not have used them (AMAZON)as this has happened more than once before.If AMAZON had a more interactive custiomer service venue I might not have to write this .frustrated x Amazon customer.
5,Review for Garmin GSC 10 Sensor,I love the extra info I'm now getting on my training bike runs. Highly recommend theGarmin GSC 10 - Speed & cadence sensorto all road bikers.
2,"Faulty Unit, Be Aware for Bad Manufacturing","Unfortunately, as Garmin has expanded their quality control has been poor. While I believe this has the potential to be a good product, I purchased two of these units for my bike and my wife's. One of them came with an almost dead battery and a dead speed sensor (although the cadence works well). I am not the only person with this issue as the garmin support forums have had several people complain of this issue. Replacing the unit through G has been difficult as well. Their call center is slow and overwhelmed.The second unit works perfectly as expected, and provides what is advertised. The unit seamlessly pairs with both my forerunner 310xt and my wife's forerunner 405.So, while the product itself, if it worked w/o problem I would rate as a 4, the QC issues and issues with Garmin Customer Support make the GSC (which I am otherwise a fan of) a 2 star rating."
5,Haven't had to adjust it yet!,I've probably rode over 600 miles since installing this on my road bike. Haven't had any problems yet and it has stayed lined up and registered with no problems thus far!
3,The Design Needs Improvement,"Thumbs Up - Works well. Doesnt seem bothered by the shock, vibration, and movement associated with my full suspension mountain bike.Thumbs Down - Speed magnet and speed sensor arm (the arm that rotates) look delicate. Cadence magnet needs complete redesign. The spacing between the crank and the trailing arm is much greater on a full suspension bike than usual. Most people are making their own spacer (I did) but the offset tie wrap makes it difficult."
2,Review for Garmin's speed cadence sensor,I read many reviews on this product that warned me about the battery sent with the unit needed to be replaced. I didn't have that problem. My problem is that I can't use the sensor with my mountain bike (Trek). The sensors that come with the device(3 counting the main unit) do not seem to align properly causing the product to not work.
3,A gadget that doesn't mount easily on a mountain bike,"Once installed, the cadence sensor just works. It is useful? Not really: don't expect major improvements in your performance. At the end of the day, it's your body who will tell you how hard or fast or powerful you can go. It's a gadget that caters to the boys with toys. The die hard riders have long ago switched to power sensors, which are far more useful (and expensive.)To get it install, I had to do quite a bit of ninja patching. The space between the chain stay and crank of a mountain bike is quit a bit less than on a road bike, so the part with the magnet that's supposed to be attached to the crank just doesn't fit. My solution was to completely rip apart this part, extract the magnet and attach it to the crank with old fashioned duct tape."
1,Stopped working after about 2-Months...,I bought this unit to work with my Garmin Edge 500 GPS unit so that I could log speed and distance in the house whenever I used my trainer. The thing worked perfectly fine for about 2-months and then just completely stopped working. I replaced batteries and reset it to the Edge 500 unit many times but it never worked again so I gave up on it. I never used it in rain and it had absolutely no reason to stop working other than some kind of flaw in the unit itself. I refuse to buy another one because I'm afraid the exact same thing will happen.
5,Garmin GSC 10 Speed/Cadence - Works With Timex Global GPS,"I actually bought 2 of these because my wife and I both ride. She has a Garmin 305 and I have a Timex Global GPS. After reading poor reviews on the Timex cadence meter I decided on the Garmin. This unit was easy to mount both on my TT bike and her road bike and they both easily synced up with our GPS watches. Rode about 55 miles after installing and they were both pretty spot on. It is really great for the trainer to have speed, distance and cadence. Very happy with the product. Recommended."
5,Great product,It does what it is supposed to do and does it well. It clamps right onto my chain stay and stays put.
5,Great internet retailer,"I'm not so much writing a review of the product, which is the speed / cadence sensor for the Garmin cycling GPS units as I am the seller(and is a great product), but rather a review of the seller, GPS City.The seller described in detail the item accurately and shipped the item promptly and were a pleasure to deal with.Thank you GPS City."
1,Flimsy and cheap,"Despite mounting all the pieces exactly as instructed, I couldn't get this device to consistently work. The plastic slides out of place at the slightest bump, and within 2 weeks the sensor arm has come loose and snapped off. I've got a Garmin Forerunner 305 and absolutely love it, but would not recommend this accessory."
1,Not a good choice for a cruiser style bike,"I bought the GSC10 off Amazon to go with my new FR60. It was available on Amazon for almost half the price of what I could get it for directly from Garmin. (Gotta love Amazon!)According to the instructions, the pedal magnet must be within 5mm of the GSC10; and the sensor arm must be within 5mm of the spoke magnet. There is not a way, (on my cruiser-style bike at least) that all the components can be mounted within a close enough proximity to each other. Disappointing, but I can only assume that the folks that are more likely to use this item ride a different style of bike altogetherAs a side note, I had given up on the installation and went onto Amazon to return it, only to see that (according to Amazon) that this bike sensor is only compatible with the following HR monitors: Garmin Edge 305, Edge 305CAD, and Forerunner 305. But my FR60 is listed as a compatible device on Garmin.com.[....]I assume that Amazon is incorrect."
5,Works as advertised,"A few hundred miles now and no issues. It took me a few tries to get the initial setup (link to Garmin Forerunner 305), but now it syncs up every time with no issues. I thought it was a good price for a Garmin product as well."
2,I don't see the laps,My watch is the garmim triathlon anda I just can not see the counting laps in him. I realy don't now what's going on.
3,Speed/cadence sensor won't stay put!,The mounting process for the cadence sensor is fairly weak when you consider composite/carbon fiber chainstays and tapered tubes. The zip-ties aren't tight enough to keep the unit from sliding one way or the other and it eventually moves too far away from the magnets. Strong double-stick or industrial Velcro would be a better mount.
3,Design flaw,"When placing the sensor, it turns out that there is too much tilt towards the crank. After one bump on the road, or hitting it with my road shoe, the arm of the sensor moved and the spokes hit it and broke it off. I am now on my second sensor."
3,Broke first time out,This wasn't a smooth installation and the speed sensor arm broke about 5 miles into my first ride when I caught a small stick in my spokes. Worked great before it broke though!I also wish it had the ability to use just the cadence part of the sensor and disable the speed sensor if desired.
4,Very useful,"I bought this to use to with my Garmin Forerunner 305 and now it's fitted to the bike it works great and I find it really useful. I did, however, find it a bit messy to fit. It comprises of three parts - the sensor, the pedal magnet and the spoke magnet. At first I thought that I was missing one part because the two magnets stuck to each other. On reflection, I suppose it's pretty obvious that this would happen but at the time it took me a little time to realize this.The included instructions are not very clear but I did find a video showing how to attach it to the bike. Just search youtube for ""Garmin Edge 800 Cadence sensor install."""
4,Nice,"Works very well with my indoor trainer. I have not used it on an outdoor ride yet. Initially, it seems more complicated to hook up then it actually is. Once you realize what you're looking at its no different than any other bike computer set up."
4,Needs a better cadence magnet,"My cadence magnet fell off quickly. I replac it with a simple small rare earth magnet on my crank with excellent success. You just place it on the back side of your pedal stud and it sits there, unobtrusive and works flawlessly. They should be included as original equipment IMO"
5,Excellent Match for Garmin Edge 500 Bike Computer,"If you have a Garmin Edge 500 bike computer, you need to have this. It installs quickly and easily and provides very useful information. Gives you cadence and much more accurate speed and distance readings. I used pliers to get the zip ties on super tight so they wouldn't move and they have stayed in place now for over a year. Great add on. Would definitely recommend."
3,Issues with FR 50 never allowed me to truly evaluate,"Alhough I love the concepts of the Garmin fitness products with 8 - 6 Monday thru Friday support and advice such as ""replace the battery again and still having problem call back"" can not suggest a Garmin solution."
5,Required reading for people with health insurance,"As a physician who has dealt with many HMOs, I believe this will become the premier guide for people to get the best care out of whatever system they're using. It is about time someone put all of the secrets and resources in one place. Medicine has changed significantly in the last few years - right under the noses of most patients and doctors. It's caused frustration as quality care has diminished. This book will help you get back in charge. I think it should be given out by insurance plans as a guide to how patients should use the system. Congrats to the authors!"
5,A Good Story,"""High school student Eric Fitzpatrick's plans for escape go awry when he meets Brooks, a mysterious, wealthy, black student at a local prep school. Now Eric is forced to come to terms with not only his family and community, but with his warring ambitions and desires."" - from Stonewall Inn"
2,Not the worse,"Buena historia.Pero muy repetitivo.Al voltar cada pagina parece que estas leyendo lo mismo en diferente orden.Good plot but, way tooo looong!!!.Over and over the same thing."
1,Fluid extractor,"This is the second extractor of this style I have purchased. The first one worked a little, but this one did not work at all. Very dissapointing. I would not buy this product it is a waste of money."
3,Not as good as I remember,"I played this game when it first came out and loved it. However, on replay, I found it tedious. The movie is good, although too repetitive, and some of the puzzles are too hard to be fun. There is also a lot of wandering around aimlessly, revisiting the same places over and over. Maybe I have just lost patience as I have gotten older. The prequel, the 7th Guest, is still playable, but I would skip the 11th hour."
1,the 11th hour,I could not play it as it did not want to be downloaded on either a 98 windows or an ME windows so beware as you could be out of pocket money and not be able to use it. the saving grace I didn't pay much for it.
2,A poor sequel to a not-so-great game.,"While The 7th Guest was hardly a fantastic game, The 11th Hour is not even up to its standard. The 11th Hour is mostly boring, and doesn't have the same sense of energy or personality that helped set The 7th Guest apart from other CD-ROM showcase games of the early 1990s. Even if you were a fan of The 7th Guest, The 11th Hour is boring and better skipped by. CD-ROM games these days generally need to be at least a little more than graphics showcases; the inheritance of The 11th Hour is no longer enough in this day and age."
3,11th hour,"I thought this game was somewhat entertaining for me. I haven't gotten it yet to play on my windows 7 system quite yet, but I have played it in the past. The game follows what happens after the 7th guest and Henry Stauf-the mastermind behind it all. Gameplay goes like this: bits and pieces show up every hour and after that hour is over you get to see the whole hour before going to the next one like a film clip. Youtube has the whole movie for you to enjoy, watch that and play the game once.You are equipped with a Gamebook which acts like your journal and your hint system if you happen to get stuck. I got stuck a lot but see how you do..."
1,Memories of game cannot be re-lived,"I had memories of how much my wife had enjoyed playing 7th Guest and 1th Hour. I thought that I would buy this for her to install on her computer but, alas, found that I could not install it on her machine running Windows XP; not even in compatability mode. Seems that the game ties itself to specific sound and video cards. Oh well, it was a nice thought."
3,disappointed by false statement,I would have liked to know this game didn't play on win 98 or vista without having to download anything else.
5,elvis book,This was an awesome book for any Elvis fan. It was not just a Elvis book of facts but a book from one friend to another. You could feel the love and friendship with every turn of the pages.
3,Jerry Loved Elvis Like A Brother - End of Story,"It's a fairly good book about Elvis and a lot of good stuff written about Jerry. I did not think there was enough in-depth information about Elvis in the book - especially about all the women that Elvis was involved with. I'm sure Jerry knew them all, but said nothing much about them because of Priscilla and wanting to keep his friendship with her and Lisa Marie. Jerry must have known Gladys and Vernon and could have said more about all of that part of Elvis's life too, but didn't. This is a pretty good book and it is well-written, but I was looking for a little more insight into Elvis's life. I know that Jerry knows a ton of stuff that he will never reveal, but that is his choice. I am a die-hard Elvis fan and read all the books I can about Elvis. This book is more about Jerry and less about Elvis."
5,By a Friend who Cared and Still Cares,"A cut above the average Elvis book.Elvis has generated an awful lot of books, most of them written by someone outside of the direct Memphis Mafia. Here is a book by a man who was probably as close to Elvis as anyone else. Their relationship started when he was twelve years old in a pickup football game. Their friendship lasted through the rest of Elvis' life and Mr. Schilling has continued to be friends with the remainder of the family.As a result, this book is written with a tenderness filled with love for a lifelong friend. To be sure he talks about some of the bad times, but it's clear that he cares enough to not dwell on these.A surprising part of the book is the interaction between Elvis and other music stars of the time. The path that Elvis carved was wide indeed. Here are insights as to why and how Elvis played such a large part in the developing of the music scene."
3,A little to kissy face for me....,"I enjoyed learning some details that could only be relayed by an inner circle guy...but felt JS was WAY to sugar coated for me...can he actually expect us to believe the Graceland (or Cali, or Vegas, or Hawaii or Palm Springs) parties were driven by Coca Cola, Pepsi and Iced Tea? Plus glossing over , what had to be, a intersting sexual dynamic with all the girls....Jerry comes across as a nice guy who did not want to ruffle any feathers. The whole thing felt very anticeptic to me-"
5,Best book written on Elvis from his friends perspective,"I love this comraderie between Elvis and Jerry Schiling. To me, it is the very best book written about Elvis with many unique untold stories from Jerry about his times spent with Elvis. I do believe he was one of the few of the Memphis Mafia that was really Elvis' friend, and I believe Elvis was aware what a good friend Jerry was. He doesn't shy away from some of the life Elvis lead, but he soft-peddles it - which is what I think a true friend would do. He doesn't go into gory detail as some others have. It shows a perspective of Elvis from someone who truly cared about him. I find Jerry humble and caring. I'm glad Elvis had him in his life. I think he needed a true friend like Jerry. I have read this book twice, and I will probably read it again at some point. Thank you Jerry - I truly appreciate how you presented your friendship with Elvis."
4,Elvis Best,Purchased books for my Brother-In-Law for his Birthday and he has enjoyed both related books.
4,"Thank You Jerry Schilling - Best Book on Elvis, the man","I typically don't like to read all these Elvis books. However, I feel that by describing his experiences with Elvis, Jerry Schilling tells us not only about himself, but walks Elvis' fans thru life with the King on a very personal level.Even though I am too young to have ever met Elvis, I feel that Jerry gave me the best view of Elvis as a human being and how Elvis lived, worked, loved and laughed. After 30 years I feel that Elvis is overly commercialized, but Elvis was a wonderful human being. I really thank Jerry for being a terrific friend to Elvis and sharing his relationship with Elvis with Elvis' fans. Thank you so so much."
2,Schilling's List,"I think Jerry is full of crap. He's riding the Elvis bandwagon all the way to the end. Red and Sonny West have already de-bunked most of his stories, and I feel they were justified. He came into the fold late, and left in Jan. 1976. He went on to ""manage"" Lisa Marie, lol, which got him nowhere. I find it significant that he still lives in the house that Elvis bought him in the mid-seventies.Enough said,David Sexton"
1,Regurgitated material don't waste your money,"This book is a let down for all the hype it got. Jerry is obviously Priscillas poodle and it shows blatantly in this book. This soft soaping ""careful to not break any eggs"" writing is getting old. I am not saying to speak ill or write dreck like what Marty Lacker does. Just saying that the fans might appreciate you acting like you got a pair like your friend Joe who is not afraid to say his mind. Take Elvis Straight Up for example, Joe says it like it happened covers the raquetball lawsuit ,drugs,divorce, col parker etc without throwing Elvis under a bus.Is it too much to ask a representative of the Estate to acknowledge the intelligence of the fans?Jerry, If you would have told the story the way it really happened, you might start doing some good by putting those other trash authors like Nash and the likes out of business.Jerry, get back on the computer and put some kick bootie into this book. The fans will love you for it."
2,I am not impressed,"This book is very weak and tells a flowery version of Elvis' life. Not very realistic. Jerry should have written a fantasy book. Just another one out to make a buck, I think I will save my money on his $40 audio book what a rip off!!!!"
3,I'm glad he wrote his memoirs for everyone to read.,I'd actually hate to say anything bad about his book but it's not like how some people wrote it's hard to put down. I am only jumping around in it because it's kinda boring. He seems very grateful to be a friend of Elvis'. It does seem he is trying hard not to say the wrong thing in it. But I also think it's just the way he was raised. (He seems to be a nice guy). I wish there were some more pictures in it. What I've read so far that I can say IS interesting is hearing what it was like to grow up in Memphis in the 50s because times have changed SO much. I'm glad he wrote his memoirs for everyone to read.
4,"It's not great, but not bad either.","I bought this for a 15 year old as a gift. We tell stories around a fire, and all the kids want to contribute something, but they never can think of anything to say, so they now bring out their book with a flashlight to read by. Out of all the short scary stories books, that I have purchased, this one has smaller print and the paper is quality is not as good, so it's harder to read by flashlight. The stories are ok I guess, I will update this later as she reads the stories and let's me know what she thinks of each one."
5,Awesome Books-Buy the Whole Set!,Bought this for my sister-she wanted it for her birthday. She is in her 30's but remembered it from her childhood and wanted to have it for her book collection. It's just as good as we remembered it!
5,The Perfect Campfire Book! Spooky Tales and Illustrations!,"These 30 tales from around the world are much more complex and comprehensive than the stories you'll find in the Alvin Schwartz books. Relying more on story content than the gross out factor of illustrations, the Short & Shivery series are must have books for any kid going to sleepaway camp. The best stories in this volume are:The CeguaTailypoThe Soldier and the VampireBonelessThe Loup-Garou (The Werewolf)andThe GolemBut every story is good in its own right. If you want to introduce your kids to scary stories or folklore but don't want the nightmares induced by the Schawrtz books, pick up any one of the Short & Shivery books without fear. Well, without too much fear(:="
5,This book was a great book.,"This book was great because it had so many scary folk tales and tall tales. I liked that it had short stories. I liked this book more because of all the scary stories that they have in this book. The one I like the most was ""The Water Fall of the Living Ghost""."
3,"Book is okay, but editorial review needs fixing BADLY!","I'm sure this book was a fine one in its day, but this is not its day. Unfortunately, most folks are not as computer literate as I am (no offense intended), and it is very easy to confuse PocketPC 2003 with Windows Mobile 2003 just because they post the same year in the title. Though they look nothing at all alike, some folk will see that 2003 and assume it's the one for them when it isn't. I really do believe it would be in good taste, not to mention good customer relations, for the editorial review board to make a special effort to make sure that people know, from you, that this is not a book made for those with PocketPC 2003, which is not the same as Windows Mobile 2003. It would go a really long way toward excellent customer relations.Blessings,Phyl Shimaka"
5,Who Wouldn't Want to Buy This?,"I have seen the Gundam Wing Series almost twice over now from a friend of mine. This series has excellent character development, plots and subplots, along with tons of gun loving mecha. What more could you want? Each character in this series you learn to love and understand, but behind every character lies a secret and a bit of suspense which keeps you wanting to watch more. This series captivates the different philosophies of war and peace, but this is not as dull as it sounds. These Gundams are a guarantee that there will be action in beatifully choreographed battles. The first DVD (eps 1-5) served to push the series off and create the suspense needed to pull you along for the grandest ride of your life."
3,Another wonderful Gundam Wing DVD,"I love this DVD, it's storyline is getting very exciting. I know you'll like it as well!"
3,"Songs are good, but treatment is BAD.","First of all, if you want to have ""full length original version"" as it was on original 12"", I recommend not to buy this CD because compiler did very BAD treatment. They made fade out/in between every tracks, so you will hear next song's 3 or 4 seconds intro at the end of song! I am VERY VERY disappointed (I couldn't believe the good reviewer like DKW ""Mr. Pac Dan"" did not mention this important point in his review...).On the song side, this compilation contains very rare mix that's hard to find on CDs. One of the true gem is Bronski Beat's ""Hit That Perfect Beat (Instant Mix)""!! This song released on three 12""s in UK, 1st ""Extended Version"", 2nd ""Instant Mix (remixed by Ian Levine)"", 3rd ""Metropolitan Version (Produced by Mike Thorne)"". And most NRG-etic & loved Ian Levine Mix was not included on Bronski Beat's ""Truthdare Doubledare"" CD (includes 1st ""Extended Version"") or other compilations. So I rate 3 stars ONLY FOR SONGS."
3,"Not Perfect, But Good Enough","Another bizarre set of remixed tracks from Oglio Records. The most annoying track is ""Room at the Top"", which wasn't interesting when it was four minutes long, and isn't any better at seven. The Belle Stars' ""World Domination"" is an odd choice, but sounds pretty good, and the inclusion of two (?) tracks by Danny Elfman/Oingo Boingo is strange. That said, the msuic flows along nicely, and yes, the beat keeps it going. Early faves are ""You Spin Me Round"" and ""Gratitude"". The less attention you pay, the better it sounds."
5,Great kid-friendly show,"This show is perfect for little ones -- very age-appropriate. There is nothing too scary, and it has well-paced, simple story lines and nice characters."
5,LOVE IT!!!,I Loved Little Bear when I was a little girl and now my baby girl gets to enjoy it too. Absolutely LOVE IT!!!!
5,Great show,This is a fantastic show for young children and elementary age kids. I wish we had more of them. Innocent and entertaining - hard combo to find these days!
4,Great for preschoolers,Downloaded on my kindle to watch with my grandchildren. They enjoyed the episodes very much and it gave us something to look forward to for the next day.
1,"Might be Good - I'll Never Know, Though","I've looked long and hard for light, non-slip slippers for my 90-year old mother. I ordered this pair from Silvert's, and instead of sending size 7 they sent size 6. I called customer service and they couldn't care less. They told me it was my fault for ordering the wrong size. I've bought over 700 items from Amazon over the past 10 years, and though some products have not been what I expected, I have never actually ordered incorrectly. There's no way they can prove it was my fault and not theirs, yet they would not waive the $9.99 shipping fee.Anyway, the slippers appear well-made. They're very cushiony, sole is flexible, and they're reasonably attractive. I'd buy them again (in the right size!) but I will NEVER order from Silvert's again."
3,okay,better than the original screen and cutter that came with the shaver. little bit expensive though. think i am going to get a rotary shaver next time since you don't have to use the Remington pre-shave which is really expensive.
3,Bad packaging,"The problem I had with the product was the packaging. They put both blades and cutters in the same little bag. These items can damage one another. So, I won't buy this item in the future for this reason."
3,Replacement heads and blades for Remington shavers,"A necessary evil - that I need to replace the heads and ""blades"" for this razor. It's a good product and shaves well but the thin ""head"" gets cut up and comes off leaving holes in the head itself. Pays to examine the razor before using as shaving with a damaged head will cut the skin. I always keep a spare replacement set in the house. Thing is the Remington shaves a lot better than it's competitors so I keep using it."
2,Foil Screen a bust,"Althought the electric razor itself does the job (close shave), the foil screens easily ""chip"" creating holes. Once a hole is formed in the foil screen, the interior blades do a job on your unprotected face. And I am talking about very small chips in the foil screen itself. In less than a year, I am on my third set of foil screens. The screens on this Remington come in pairs and they are difficult to remove and to replace from the shave head. I wish I had kept my old Remington shaver...one foil screen and one cutter blade head."
2,SHAVING,"I'M SORRY, BUT THE REPLACEMENT BLADES & SCREEN AREN'T NEAR AS EFFECTIVE AS THE ORININAL. IT TAKES TWICE AS LONG TO GET A SMOOTH SHAVE. I THINK THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO INSTALL - DON'T THINK ONE CAN GO WRONG. IF SO, LET ME KNOW. BOTTOM LINE - WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH ORIGINAL SHAVER.GUS"
1,"RE: Customer Review by ""Gham"" below and response by retailer","In response to the customer review ""Remington shaver foils and cutters"" by George Harman ""Gham"" below, the retailer Shaver Outlet Inc. makes the comment: ""you wouldnt have expected blister packaged items if you had read the product description.""Well, I say that nowhere in the product description does it say BULK DEALER STOCK.Thanks for the warning George Harman; I am another that will never buy from Shaver Outlet Inc."
4,remington cutter & blade,"box arrived on time, price is good and now I'm enjoying good shaves againonly thing left to evaluate is how long they last ..."
4,Packaging,Would prefer the cutters and foils be purchased separately as the cutters need replacing less often than the foils. As it is it results in an unnecessary expense.
1,Poor,These perform worse than the two year old screen and blades I was using before. These don't shave as close and so it takes longer to get the job done.
2,Not as good as orginal,The cutter blades are not very durable. After about 8 or 10 shaves the blades have becomevery dull. This replacement is of very poor quality compared to the orginal equiment.
3,Remington foil screen & cutter blade,Shaves close for an electric. Wears out a little too soon. Cutter blade heads tend to fall off while cleaning. No big deal though.
5,Screen and Cutters Work Well,"I have a couple of Remington MS200-series shavers. One was starting to do a poor job. I replaced the screen and cutter blade heads, and the shaver now works just fine."
5,Smooth face again; happy wife,"The screen and cutter blade head combination arrived sooner than I thought it would. I needed only the screen but am glad to have extra cutting blades. I was somewhat concerned that it would fit because the product number was not exactly the same as my razor, but it fits just fine."
5,works well,I signed up to reorder this part every 8 months. So I am reminded when I should replace the part.
2,Difficult to install,"Quality of the materials is OK, I guess. Ease of installation and instructions to do so however are very poor."
1,Wear Out Too Quick !!,I use this daily of course & they wear out too quick & are too stinkin expensive. The screen develops holes & then the bare blades dice your face.
3,Installation Not Clear or Easy,"I'm very intellligent, yet understanding what had to be done to install the screen was difficult. It took about 15 minutes to perform the 1 minute installation because a major step was not clear or intuitive."
1,Blades immediately went dull,This replacement set gave about one decent shave and then appeared to become dull immediately. Shaver is virtually unusable after 5 shaves. Do not buy this product!
3,SP-69 MS2 Foil Screen & Cutter Blade Head,"1. The Remington Shaver I have used for about a year is very average in many ways. For starter, it does not hold charge well. Frequent charging of the battery is necessary.2. The worse part is this screen and cutter blade head. It is very difficult to replace the screens. First, the so-called printed direction is very very difficult to read because of the very, very small print. Second, the direction itself is poorly written. Third, the design of the screens is very poor because it is difficult to remove them from the head. Clearly, it is not user friendly!"
5,"Very satisfied in Katy, TX","The replacement screen and cutters arrived very promptly, in excellent condtion. They were easy to install and are working very well. The shaver performs like new again. And with the automatic order every 6 months, I believe the pricing is a very good value."
3,Disappointing lifespan,"I purchased the Remington ""Titanium"" with the promise of longer foil life. Well, it doesn't seem so. I get about a month per foil. The only good thing is, the replacement foils (SP-69) are fairly cheap, although somewhat hard to find in my area.This particular foil does give a close shave, however."
3,Needs longer life,Nice product and certainly good design. However manufacturer should find a way to make last longer. Only option if you own the razor and expensive. Just doesn't last long enough.
1,Wrong blade,I ordered this item before and had no problems... On my second order the blades didn't not fit.... The item was not in the original package... Soo I'm not sure what the blade shipped to me goes to????
5,SP69 Replacement blades A-OK,"I was a bit nervous ordering the replacement foils/blades after reading some of the previous comments, but went ahead with the purchase because the foil heads had worn through on my shaver and I needed to do something. The product that was shipped exactly matched the picture and description shown, in other words, it arrived in the OEM Remington packaging (not in a plain brown box) as depicted. Took me about 5 minutes to pop out the old foils/blades and reinstall the new ones. I have ordered replacement blades/foils in the past and gotten ""bulk"" items in a plain brown box, but not this time. I am VERY PLEASED with this purchase."
5,"Product is NOT a cheap knockoff, excellent replacement","After I purchased this item, I read the negative reviews with great concern. They said the blades are bulk, no name replacements that wear out after a couple shaves. Also they said they are shipped not in the manufacturer plastic as depicted in the product picture. NOT TRUE. The blades ARE in the exact packaging as pictured and are the true mfr replacement blades. My shaver is like new again and the install was a snap. Thank you Amazon. After shopping all over town like a dummy, I finally signed up for the Amazon 6 month replacement program and I couldn't be happier. IGNORE the negative reviews. I don't know if, in the past, Amazon was shipping bulk knock-offs, but they aren't as of this writing."
4,Good replacement parts for a good razor,"Instructions are a little hard to read (screens need to be inserted from top of removable screen holder frame toward inside-bottom of frame). Other than that, works well. You can probably extend the life of the screen by using less pressure during your shave."
1,Cheap Knock offs - Will pull your hair out,"I have owned Remington electric razors for years, and this is the first time I have received sub-par blades and screens that actually pull your facial hair out. As many other reviews have pointed out, these are obviously cheap knock offs. Buyer beware!"
1,Don't bother.,The Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver was a Christmas gift for my husband's step-father. I read reviews and thought I made a great choice. By New Year's Day he asked us to get our money back. What a waste! We were mortified.
2,Dull,I thought the bad reviews where not accurate. I was wrong. The blades are really dull. It worse than the ones I replaced. It is back to Walmart for me.
2,60 cycle hum prone.,"Does not protect against ground loop 60 cycle hum, but cheap compared to those that do. I does power my pedals effectively but no noise cancelation..."
4,Nice adapter,"At the begining I wasn't sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this, so I decided to buy it and I started having problems right of the box, I notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals, then I started to play with them and realized that I had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain, so I decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used 4 with my pedals and surprise!, connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine, I also realized that pedals positions (routing signal) has something to do with it, I couldn't figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right, so I would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it, so it work as it is supposed to."
3,Ups and downs.,"Well, It works, but it makes a high pitch whine. And it's even worse on some gear. Specifically the Zoom A2 acoustic, and the Toneworks G2 acoustic processor. Most pedals work with a tiny amount of noise but some things will hiss like a snake in the snake. Don't use this in the studio!!, but maybe live and only on pedals that don't scream noise at you. Check each one for noise with a real wall wort VS> the spot one. I will keep it,for a back up but I will try the Boss version next and write a follow up."
4,It works great for most low power items,"It works great for five of my lower power pedal type items, including my Line 6 wireless receivers, Shure wireless receivers, and several other pedals like my Cry Baby, etc., all at once. However, the transmitter for my Shure wireless in-ear monitor, which requires less power than any of the other two items combined, will not run, even by itself, when powered by the 1 Spot. Switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own, and there is probably some little quirk in the Shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn't get along with. For most of my stuff it works great, and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords."
4,Works great.,I bought this to replace the adapter that was supplied with my boss bcb-60 pedal board and it's working fine so far. I'm currently using it to power 4 pedals. Be aware that you'll need to buy a daisy-chain if you want to power more than one device.
3,Better units out there,"I had this for my live rig for about 3 years now. It's blown and broke out of nowhere, but I did get a lot of use out of it. A few years ain't so bad eh? I wouldn't buy this again because my pedals have a few that require some variations in power. Other than that for a budget power supply it lasted a good while."
5,Extremely helpful piece of equipment,"The other reviewer already made my main pointon this item. Just wanted to remind buyers to also get the jumper cable with this if they are going to be hooking up multiple pedals. Another crucial accessory is the 9 volt battery clip adapter that 1spot makes, allowing you to ""plug in"" any pedal that will only normally run on a battery (such as the Big Muff, or home-made pedals). Unfortunately, for whatever reason, that particular item doesn't appear to be on Amazon, but I would always suggest supporting your local music shop anyway."
2,Too much buzz for me,"I will be returning this product. Yes, it will power your pedals. However (and though I can't speak for others) it added an immediate and unacceptable level of buzz to my rig. All of my peals have hardwire bypass, and there was a substantial hum even when they were all off. If I leaned over and touched one of the bypass switches with my finger, the buzz would change. Clearly a power issue. To remove all doubt, powering the pedals individually (as others have noted) fixed the problem. I guess you get what you pay for. A real power supply can be $150, and this little guy is cheap, and will indeed power your pedals, but if you are concerned about the tone of your rig, I'd fork over the $$ for a real power supply."
5,Simply the best!,"This is simply the best ""wall wart"" power supply I have ever used. Ever. It is light, small, and powerful. It has a longer cord than other ""warts"", and has the kind of hollow DC connector that stays in place rather than falling out or making a poor connection. No hum is real nice, too. If your pedals will not last the night with a battery, buy this one."
2,Too much buzz,"As a power adapter, it works. it powered all my pedals with no problems. however, there was a constant buzzing that came from my amp (marshall jcm900 combo all tube) when this was plugged in. When on the distorted channel of my amp, each of my pedals would ""pop"" whenever i activated the pedal. i dont know how it reacts with a solid state amp. there could be a completely different result, however i didnt test it."
4,On Target -right on target,"Really easy to use software to produce PRO-like schedules and time charts. No need to be a magician in terms or tricks, just proceed with basic skills. Worth using !"
1,NOT FOR MACINTOSH!!,"The product description says this software runs on Macintosh, but the product I received is for Windows. Since I threw away the packaging in order to pack it easily for my trip home, I can't send it back. Do not purchase this if you have a Mac, as it cannot be installed!"
2,Soft Serve ice cream never got hard enough to serve,Would not recommend this machine. Soft Serve never got hard enough to serve. The handle on the machine would not release any of the soft slush that accumulated after running for forty five minutes. Just not a good machine. Canister was frozen for over 18 hours at zero degrees. Machine was returned the same day it was received. Just not as advertised. Should not have to pay for the RETURN!
2,Soft Ice Cream???,"Like the others I tried to follow directions that came with the machine, but it did not freeze. I did find out that if I put the ice cream mix in the freezer for a few hours before putting in the machine it would make soft ice cream that will work in a cone. My other problem was some small plastic parts that keep getting lost in the ice cream and have been found while eating. I don't think that this is very safe. I thought that it would be a little better product."
1,Not Up to Expectations,"We looked forward to enjoying wonderful, smooth, creamy soft-serve ice cream when we ordered this Deni Automatic Soft Serve Ice Cream Maker. Unfortunately, we ended up with a cool, melted milkshake on a couple of different occasions. We tried all of the troubleshooting tips and double checked the instructions, but we did not have luck with this machine. I would not recommend this item for anyone who is expecting old-fashioned ""crank"" homemade ice cream. You just won't have the experience you are looking for."
1,Unmitigated Piece of Junk,"I am an excellent cook and have many different levels of cooking equipment. I have considered adding ice cream to my many desserts, and decided to start with an inexpensive ice cream maker to see if it was fun enough to move to a more significant purchase later. Rarely have a purchased such an inadequate piece of plastic. The assembly instructions were virtually non-existent. I follow ice cream/canister freezing instructions to the letter, and yet the ice cream never froze. I have purchased sounder, more functional chidrens' cooking equiment. After one use, i tossed the machine in the garbage. I considered giving it away, but wanted to save the unlucky next person the frustration."
1,VERY SOFT SERVE,"I am very disappointed with the Deni 5530 Automatic Soft Serve Ice Cream Maker. I followed the directions correctly the three times I made the ice cream but it never comes out of the machine cold enough, the mixture must be placed in a container and frozen before using. It tastes great but it's not the soft serve we expected."
1,"Horrible, Save Your Money- No ice, No cream- no ice cream.","I rarely write poor reviews. However, this is such a horrible product that I am sharing my experience so that others can skip this and look for something better.This did not work. The ice cream never got to a soft serve stage. It stayed runny and messy. I tried it twice. I tried following the directions exactly. I tried freezing everything. I let it run longer than it was supposed to. The ice cream was never ice and it wasn't cream- It never became ice cream. It remained runny liquid.When I called the company to see if I was doing something wrong they told me I had to partially freeze everything- the bowl, the ingredients, everything. That takes a lot of time and more importantly, it does not meet what this product promises (namely ice cream, soft serve in a short time).Save your money."
1,Horrible Product,Worthless. It leaked like a sieve. Never could get any product to stay in the chiller. Don't buy it. It's a complete and total waste of money.
1,Terrible,"First of all, this was very difficult to put together. Some of the pieces just don't seem to fit together right. I had the bucket in my freezer all winter, and pre-chilled my custard in the refrigerator overnight, and it still wasn't enough. It took over 45 minutes for it to thicken, and turned to soup within 15 seconds of serving it into a cup. It also dripped into the cup instead of coming out in a steady stream. I never came close to looking like the item photo. I tried freezing it for a few hours, and the consistency was definitely off - tasted grainy instead of smooth. Save your money and buy a regular ice cream maker where you scoop it out of the bucket."
1,Read before you buy,"I ordered this machine from All About Electronics on the Amazon site. I received the machine in good time and in good condition. Unfortunately the machine does not work no matter what you do and you cannot get your money back without spending money to return the machine. The company will not reimburse the shipping. So don't waste your money to buy this, none of them will work and your children will be as disappointed as mine.After posting this review the company contacted me and sent me a return label so I would not have any charges and promised to reimburse the purchase price after they receive the machine."
2,"Sorry, we've tried.","We've tried to get this thing to make some decent soft-serve, but all we've accomplished so far is something slightly better than soup. I'll admit the stuff tastes good, but we just can't get it to freeze enough, certainly not for a cone. The bowl stays in the freezer untilthe last minutes, but still no joy. :( Others we know have had success, and that's why the 2 stars. Maybe it's just us, but I just can't recommend it. :)"
1,GOOD IF YOU LIKE SOUP,AFTER ADDING LIQ. INGREDIENTS MACHINE RAN FO ALMOST AN HOUR...ALL I GOT WAS COLD SOUP. RETURNED THE NEXT DAY.
1,IceCreamMaker,"I never received this Item. I received another Item and returned it. I have been in negociation with Amazon for months now with no result. At the last contact I was asked to wait until August 22, 2008. I have waited, it is now Spetember 3, 2008. I have already purchased my product from another sorce and would appreciate my refund!!!! This is the worst onlin exprerience I have ever had and definately would not recomend Amazon to my worst enemy."
3,"Several Errors and Not Too Comphrensive, But Still Necessary","This strategy guide has several errors, such as leaving out some items the baddies carry and too vague or just plain wrong directions. But, still, without this guide, I'd be dead meat. The errors are relatively easy to figure out if you have any brains at all and you can avoid overlooking unmentioned items by searching the bodies of each corpse. And the color pictures were an improvement over the black and white pages of the original Tomb Raider I strategy guide. This book could have had used some improvements, but I'd be stuck in Tomb Raider II forever without it. But if you don't want to fork over the dough, just surf the net. There are literally hundreds of Lara Croft websites, complete with walkthroughs which are better than the book because it is being constantly edited and updated."
3,My ratings are on comparison to the first book,"Yes although the Strategy guide doubled in size It doesn't in any way compare to how well The first book was laid out. One it automatically figured you reviewed the first book and it went over non of the old stuff. Two The practice level at Lara's home, the first book goes really indepth of the training level well maybe not, at least though the first book mentioned it. There was nothing about the hedge maze or the fact the hole training level was updated. To sum up I think the book could have been alot better written, I would go as far as saying you should make a second book one that like the first goes over all the secrets of the game, by first I mean the one for the first game. I would bye it and I think others would as well. Send me some comments, just to let me now what people agree with me on this."
5,A. Lincoln's Devotional,"I purchased this devotional as a Christmas present for a friend. It arrived in condition as described by seller and in a timely manner. It was reasonably priced, and I am, overall, well pleased with my purchase."
3,Interesting Subject - Weak Science,"This could have been an excellent book and definitely explores some interesting possibilities, but the research is weak and does not follow solid scientific procedures. The book also spends a little too much time with anecdotal evidence of the power of Yan Xin's ""healing powers"".It should be stated that it is possible that the experiments may actually be more complete than it appears in this book. Much detail may have been lost in translation from Chinese, but that still leaves this book mediocre at best."
3,Good shave but....battery looses charge quickly.,"Have used Norelco shaver for several years and was ready for a new shaver. This Remington looked very similar to my Norelco and had many of the same features and was 1/2 the price so I decided to try it. While I was impressed with the quality and the close shave I found that the battery lost its charge very quickly even when it was not being used. I returned it for another unit and it did exactly the same thing. So it seems like they are having some battery issues with this model (9270)! It is not quite the same quality as the Norelco, but for the difference in price it is definetly a good value. Now it is a question of how long this battery will last. It does have a 2 year warranty, so I would make sure I kept my receipt."
2,"Shaves OK, battery life unacceptable.","It shaves adequately, nothing exceptional, but you better keep it plugged in. After two shaves, the battery life indicator is at 80%. You won't get a third shave before it quits dead.Most others reviewing this product have the same experience."
2,A close shave but no cigar!,"Shaving closeness-pretty good for the first year, when the sidburn shaver stopped working, and I replaced it with a Braun Syncho 7526! The batteries in the Remington gave me five shaves max. The Braun: 11 and still counting! Replace the Remington cutters in a year. The Braun: 18mos!No comparison between the Remington and the Braun!"
4,Appears to be a good shaver.,"A good shaver, comfortable to use. So far so good. Would recommend to others."
2,Dissatisfied,"This ""premium"" shaver gives a close shave but leaves my face irritated. After only a few months the battery started to fail and then worked only with a cord. This is my third experience with Remington battery failures. They are far below the norm. It seems that the more gadgets and displays the shavers have, the more likely thay are to fail."
4,Really good for the price,"I've been using this product for over nine months now. It still shaves fine with the original set of rotating blades. You can't expect the quality of a non-electric, though. The key to a good shave using this is to not move around really quick, but to spend a few seconds at each location. Cleaning is as easy as placing it under running water for a few seconds. It needs to be charged after 3-4 shaves, and I've used it with some success in the shower too.Overall, a good value for the money.It loses a star because I hoped it would be as good as a non-electric... I don't think there's any product out there that is."
4,Good shaver ... no match with the conventional Gillete blades,It is Good. Difficult to clear the stubs below the jaws.
1,Cheap and ugly.,You get what you pay for. The pic looks much better than the real item. The material is cheap and the fit is all wrong.
1,Cute but not worth it,"My son loves Deigo so I thought this would be a good choice to start learning to use the potty. Its obvious when he sits on it that he is not fully comfortable and wont sit longer than a minute. Its really small and narrow, is hard plastic and the green ""pot"" slides and seems to pinch. It is also a little unstable and tilts when he tries to get up from it. I am currently looking for another product and will use this for a stool."
3,Very cute,"My daughter loves dora, and will sit on it and use it. But the potty hurts her butt sometimes. I wish there was a dora potty that does not hurt when sitting on it because my daughter will only use dora potty."
2,I would make changes to the design,"I would change the design of this potty chair.1> The green pan comes off to easily. The plastic sticks to my daughters thighs and comes off of the seat and spills urine all over. If I could purchase a different one, I would get one that has the pan that slides out instead.2> The seat that fits onto the base removes too easily for the early stages of potty training when your young toddler like to explore how things work. My daughter just rips it right off. However, if you are using it as the chair that fits onto the toilet seat, it stays nicely and is sturdy. I would like it if it was as sturdy on the base as it is on the potty seat.3> The stool has rubber grips on the bottom are very sturdy and don't slip at all when used as a stool.4> The Dora & Boots picture is actually a sticker and mine had a few bubbles in it. Already the ticker is showing some wear from using bleach to clean the potty chair and we have had this for less than a month."
3,"Cute, but we never used it.",This was cute and my kids like it...to play with. they dont't use it for potty. The pot is too large to sit on to cause the kids' behinds to sink in.
2,Fast delivery - average product quality,"The shaver came within the time frame promised and it provides a close shave, but after using it for a few weeks now I've noticed the battery life is a lot worse than my last Remington MS3. This one only lasts about 1-1/2 shaves before needing a charge and my old would last a week or more! I'm not sure if it sat on the shelf too long before selling, the battery in the new shavers are weaker than the old, or perhaps infant mortality of the battery (i.e. bad batch of batteries?). Not very happy with this shaver..."
1,Stopped Working!,"This product was great for about 3 weeks. Then, although charged to its capacity,just stopped shaving hair. I have to say though, that when I called Remington,they were absolutely great about it. They said that the model is no longer beingmade and they would send me another shaver at no cost (still waiting but am confidentthat it will arrive)."
1,Do not let someone get this for you,"Hello. I'm seventeen and reaching the age where I need a razor. I've tried disposable razors but don't like the itchiness left to the skin. I mentioned in passing to my parents that I would like an electric razor. I would be happy to find a good one if they would order it by the end of the week.The next day, my mom told me not to worry; she had just ordered one.[...]I look at it and immediately frown. I did a little research on my own and had never heard of Remington as a reputable razor. I heard of Norelco, Braun, and Panasonic and had been hoping for one of those. So I grudgingly take it, and try to shave. I have relatively smooth skin with small hair ""patches"". I tried shaving for 25 minutes to no avail. I now have very itchy skin and hair growing. I'm back to using disposables until I get a new razor. I can't return it because my mom threw out the receipt and packing stuff.[...]"
5,Remington MS3-2700 Titanium Shaver,Arrived on time. Met all my expectations -- it's a great shaver. Price was very reasonable.
2,Battery Life is a Major Issue,"I have had three Remington shavers and they perform great, but poor battery life is the achilles heel of the product. With daily shaving, expect your battery to last about 18 months. After that, it's time to either ship it to an 'authorized repair site' and incur a big fee or plunk down more cash for a new one.By the way, the battery bypass cord is useless if the battery dies. It can't bypass without some sustainable life in the battery so the shaver is dead when the battery goes. Not exactly what I'd call consumer friendly engineering."
2,screens too fragile,"This shaver works well except that the screens require changing even more often than every 3 months, as stated by the manufacturer. Since these are pretty expensive to replace, you wind up spending as much as needed to get a new shaver every year. Not for me, I'm looking for a new model..."
2,I'm going back to Braun!,"I owned a Braun shaver prior to this one, but thought that I would give Remington a try. The $40 Braun gave a much closer and comfortable shave then my ""now for sale"" MS3-2700. On top of a closer shave with the Braun I was not forced to replace the foil after 4 months of use. Try it if you want, but I would not recommend this product. Want to buy mine? :)"
2,Not the best Remington!!,I've had Remington's before and I must say this is not their best product. It can be found cheaper if you must have it but I also have used Braun's before and is a superior product although much more expensive. I have tried many different methods of shaving but this razor still burns my face everyday no matter what i do. I have not had any problem with battery charge as some have talked about.
2,Great shaver until the batteries go.,"Got a great shave until, after 9 months, the batteries would not hold a 4 day charge of morning shaves. Tried to take it apart to replace the rechargeable batteres. Forget the screws- it's all glued together and is meant to be thrown away, I guess. Hello China & Good luck!!!"
4,Good Product,"I have problems with my hands/wrists while on the keyboard -- I used to wrap my wrists, but the support gloves are better. They keep my hands warm as well as support my wrists."
2,NETTING,"THE MATERIAL IS VERY SOFT, MAYBE GOOD TO COVER SHRUBS OR ORNAMENTAL PLANTS BUT I NEED IT TO PROTECT MY POND FROM ANIMALS"
2,DONT ACCEPT DELIVERY IF THE PACKAGE IS BENT,"I bought two, one package was badly bent. I could not get the roll straightened out and could not use the netting.The netting in the unbent box worked great."
2,Expensive,"Very expensive, don't see why anybody should pay $800 for this product.The shelves and door have a plastic coating (or a film) which gives it a shine. The problem is that the coated surface gets damaged easily in assembly. The door was difficult to attach to the cabinet body. The hinges did not fit easily in the door's grooves. I had to use painters tape to make the hinges thick so that they stayed in the door's groove.I will not buy expensive Salamander products in the future."
4,Well built with minor problems,"This equipment rack is well built and by far the easiest piece of furniture I have ever had to assemble. Although it was straightforward it did take approximately 2 hours to complete from beginning to end. No part of this unit looks cheap or underdeveloped with one exception - the instructions. There was a typo and an omission for two metal bars and where they were supposed to go. Otherwise, I have nothing but positive things to say about the product. Would definitely buy again!"
3,"Nice Cabinet, terrible packaging","The cabinet is pretty nice and fits all my components as planned.I do have to agree with virtually every other reviewer here: The packaging is terrible. The box arrived punctured, the various pieces are not sufficiently protected. Almost every piece had some minor scratches and the door insert (metal) was dented significantly. I'm not sending it back due to the hassle involved, and because the next one might be in even worse condition, but cheap packaging like this is pretty disappointing for such an expensive prooduct."
3,Disappointed!,"I had fond memories of this series from growing up watching British television. When Michael Crawford brought the ""Phantom"" over here, I was reminded of the lovable, bumbling idiot he played in Some Mother's... I finally ordered this three disc set and looked forward to some hilarious comedy - I was so disappointed! It's not nearly as funny as I remembered - though I still admire the scope of this man's talents, to go from this to ""The Phantom."""
5,A Great Shoe,"This is a very,very comfortable shoe, I have had them for more than 5 months and almost wear them avery day and they still look great, I love Rockport shoes and these are my favorite ones."
3,3 of 5,i use these 5 days a wk for work and at 1st they worked great but after many uses the allens dont stay fold in due to usage
5,GREAT MELLOW MUSIC,Tuck&Patti do a Great Justice to Accoustic Music.Patti has a Fantastic Voice&Tuck Plays The Guitar with alot of Feeling.COmbined it is Pure Magic through out this Best of Disc.Time After Time&The Jimi Hendrix Tributes are Fantastic.
5,A fantastic introduction to accoustic talent,"If you like accoustical music, Tuck and Patti is a combination which is magical. The ""Best of"" is for those who want to trial the magic of this duo. If listening to this does not make you buy the other albums, I'd be surprised. This music is innovative and skillfull. It is commercial enough to please mainstream listeners and technical to impress us jazz maniacs. Her voise and his guitar combine with a marriage which probably reflects their own relationship. Keep it up the both of you, I wish you came to London more often."
4,Simplicity is Superb,"Tuck & Patti offer versions of songs that are simple, clean, pure, and inspiring. I previously enjoyed ""As Time Goes By,"" but after listening to this version, I have a new favorite rendition. ""Time After Time"" also is a clean, crisp alternative. ""Takes My Breath Away"" leaves you hanging on each note as it is played simply, cleanly, and warmly."
4,Takes my breath away,Patti's voice and phrasing literally takes my breath away. This is a hugely talented duo; musical energy presented with a gentle touch.
3,"strong, but not the strongest","I strongly agree with the other reviewer's comments about Rob Brown on alto. While I tremendously enjoyed O'Neal's porch (5 stars, IMHO), including his playing there, he is only intermittantly able to produce interesting music in the freer spaces of this album. I'll add that, on serveral cuts, particularly towards the end of the second disk, the album moves into the four- or five-star categroy, but man there's a lot of other stuff here, too. I wasn't previously familiar with Cooper-Moore, and his playing here was a welcome revelation for me. I am now looking for more of his stuff..."
5,Aaron Carter Rules,"Aaron Carter is an amazing performer and that is very evident. He has so much talent and he isn't just a mini ""Nick"" or ""Leslie"". Check this video out and see his OWN Talent."
4,Fun to watch and still the coolest,"The prince of pop has finally grown up and now hes taken the world by storm. ""tell me what you want"" and ""aarons party"" sound so great, and so strong. This is a wonderful tape and i encourage everyone and anyone to get it now :)"
1,aaron's party live in concert,I like the VHS because it was so cool and aaron carter rock the VHS called Aaron's party live in concert.
5,Haunting.,"This is the one book that I have in my library that I have been unable to read twice. Although reading this book encouraged me to read all of Susan Isaacs other books (many times in fact), I find myself unable to re-read Almost Paradise. I am reminded immediately of the sad ending and horrible circumstances of Jane's early years.Your life will be enriched by this novel and you will want more from the witty and profound Ms.Isaacs (when is her next book by the way?). By all means share this treasure with a friend, but I dare YOU to read it a second time."
4,Great Read,"This was a great read and I can understand why other reviews were so compelling. The book is almost 700 pages and it got a bit boring around the 500-page mark, but picked up after that. Suspenseful ending."
4,"I lauged, I cried --- REALLY!!!","I read this book many years ago, but for sheer entertainment value, it can't be beat. As usual, Susan Isaacs kept me in stitches, but the book was also a real ""put-it-down-and-sob""work. I'm sure it has nominal literary worth, but I didn't care, and I doubt you'll mind either."
4,Read this at your own risk--it becomes your world!,"I am an ardent fan of Susan Isaacs, but I must say that as far as characters go, this one is by far the best. Tracing the two main characters back to their great-grandparents, Susan Isaacs creates a love story about two real and painfully human beings. I came to love these characters. I simply couldn't put the book down; it became an obsession.Be prepared to lose yourself in this novel. Also be prepared to laugh aloud, to feel your heart soar and your heart ache, and definitely bring a hankie."
1,I just don't understand....,"....the rave reviews for this book. I ordered this book based on the many excellent comments from reviewers, and found myself wondering if I was reading the same book. I found the book tedious, with its dreary and far-too-long story of the ancestors of the main characters. When the book finally got around to them, I found Jane and Nicholas, the main characters, completely unsympathetic. In short, I was bored to tears. Found myself flipping forward to find SOME interesting part, but finally gave up and read the last chapter. Normally I pass on books to my local library, but, not wanting to inflict this book on another unsuspecting person, it's going in the trash recycling bin."
2,too cute,"I found the characters in this story just too cute to be believable. Jane and Nick living in a roach-infested apartmentand they're rehearsing a play which he is about to appear. Laying on the floor, his head on her belly, I could just puke.I think Susan Issacs went to far with this one."
1,I tried! I really tried!,"Not to say that Almost Paradise is not well written! That part if fine! BUT, this is coming from a woman who has read almost all of Oprah's book choices . . and this was such a depressing book that I didn't finish it! It was like walking up one step . . then getting knocked down three! I don't know when I have read a book that had so few redeeming male characters. They start out fine . . pull themselves up by their boot straps and POW! Turn into pigs! I really likedLily White, but this! NOPE!"
2,What a miserable view of men!,"I have read other Susan Isaac books, and enjoyed her wit immensely, but I can't figure out how anyone found this book funny. It was a miserable, appalling view of men and the women weren't much better. Nevertheless, I could have read it simply as a soap opera had I been given a happy ending, but I was furious when I got to the end. I couldn't believe I had slogged through all that tragedy to only have it all end on a miserable note. Do NOT read this book unless you enjoy sadness upon sadness with no hope in sight. DO read her other books."
1,Why?,"I read Susan Isaac's ""Shining Through"" and just ate it up, so I figured her other books would continue with this quick paced dialogue and hunt for details. ""Almost Paradise"" had both, but unfortunately, it was surrounded by a story which made this reader believe that there is no such thing as fidelity, honesty, and true love in married relationships. A big dissappointment."
1,Agonizing,"I am 44 y/o and started reading when I was 3. I can honestly say that this is among the absolute WORST books I have EVER read! It started out ok, when Jane arrived in London and got hit by the car...after that, it SUCKED! The most BORING book...I kept trying and trying to get something good out of it, to no avail. I just couldn't take it anymore! Finally, I gave up and just read the ending - and IT sucked too!!!"
3,Too much information,"The author of this book is obviously a considerable scholar -- but he provides us with so much detail on areas related to the Theatrum that it is difficult to focus on his own stated aim : telling us why the atlas was ""a watershead publication; it changed lived and altered perceptions for ever"". Plus, he has positioned the chapters dealing with the atlas itself at the very back, so we only get to it after wading through Ortelius' life and times and many associates in exhaustive detail. Also, I would have liked to see discussion of some of the current historical map contraversies -- like the Piri Ries maps, or the possible Portaguese discovery of Australia.Hard for me to maintain my initial enthusiasm."
2,Dated,"While this book has useful and relevant text, all of the pictures are clearly dated. This is great if you're trying to design a home of the 80's, but not today."
2,not the best,"This video was a disappointment. It has VERY long looks at very few works of art, from one museum. It leaves out a lot more than it covers, as far as his process, development, and personal information."
3,Joan Miro Constellations,"This portrayal of Joan Miro is very theatrical ... a very colorful and I thought informative narrative .. but at times you could not hear the narrative very well or at all because of the loudness of the background, well, foreground music."
5,Typical Galbraithian Work,"If you're a fan of Professor John Kenneth Galbraith you'll definitely want to get your hands on a copy of this. It tends to stray away from technicality, as he tends to, and focus on getting the message across.This book is in an interview format, and is hence even easier to read.It is exactly what is says, and is very good for an introduction to neo-classical economics, and Galbraith's view of the status-quo trends."
1,"Broken Faceplate, no power adapter","I can't even turn it on to test, because does not came with a power adapter, and there is no information about it on the product page."
3,unraveling,"I purchased the flag three months ago in June. I fly it every day beneatth the American flag. Already the hemmed edges are feathering-out, and getting taily."
3,Valley Forge flags are good quality,Valley Forge flags are good quality but don't survive long on a moving vehicle display.Annin flags are IMO better for motion and higher wind use.
4,Bikini Wax Walk!,"Yep. Puerile, juvenile, at turns great fun, at turns lame...eh, er.. Punk. Still, you can beat ""Bikini Wax Walk"" for a feel-good instrumental piece of genius. It'll have you up and dancing in ten seconds flat. Someone should do a remix or extended version. Click on the audio sample and hear for yourself."
1,As bad as the titles sound,"These guys try to make fun of the new wave scene with a lame B-52's imitation and a bunch of barely-funny dirty jokes. Probably done by a bunch of old-school rock musicians that just ""didn't get"" the new wave movement, or were just trying to sell this stuff on shock value. Unfortunately, it backfired on them. This was their only album."
2,Overall this is a boring book.,"Overall this book is boring , it is mostly for people that's probaly over the age of 30 or who has been out of the club scene.He tend to state some of the same stuff through this various chapters."
2,Read the book & took his class: nothing particularly insightful,"I'm not a business person, but I took Mr. Ward's class and read (most of) his book. There was nothing that I found particularly insightful in here, besides the basic accounting practices that are used in the healthcare field. Good introduction, but almost no depth and the writing is not always that clear. If you need it for a class, it is not a bad book, but I wouldn't buy it just because."
3,Health care budgeting fundamentals,Even I learned to develop a spreadsheet and calculate cost with this no-nonsense guide. I found this a useful introduction to the topic.
4,perfect clogs for fall,"Just love these clogs!I oredered size 40 (European). I'm usually take a size 9 or 9.5 American. These shoes are a good fit, though just a little loose in front. A 39 would have been too small I think. Wearing socks helps.They are comfortable & well-cushioned, though not extremely so. If I was doing a whole lot of walking I'd probably choose another shoe.I do wear a lot of clogs and though I usually prefer them with some embellishements or a little fancier design, these are just great & I've been wearing them nearly every day. They are lightweight & look good.The green suede is really attractive & perfect for these fall days in the Pacific Northwest. I sprayed some leather protector /water repellent on them and am ready to face a wet autumn. (As a matter of fact I'll be wearing them to a tailgate at the Husky game this weekend.)"
1,Doesn't Work,I have a Heart Rate Transmitter & Strap. It doesn't work. I sent many e-mails to Garmin and got absolutely no help from them. (That's unusual for Garmin.)
1,Be Careful ! Not for the Forerunner 305 !!,"The listing for this product is misleading. It states that it is for the Forerunner 305 and the Edge 305, however, it won't work with the Forerunner 305. If you look more closely, this is stated in the technical details description for the product. I orderd this as a replacement for the monitor that came with my Forerunner and it absolutely will not work."
1,Battery cover not sweat-tight,"Be careful replacing the battery. The cover is not moisture tight and if it is not sealed, corrosive sweat can reach the electronics in side giving your monitor the electonic equivalent of a fatal heart attack."
3,"Precise, but lasted less than 2 years","Changed the batteries, followed the instructions of a Garmin technician, but had to buy a new one. Hope this lasts longer."
1,NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED,I ordered this item thinking I would be getting what is pictured that being a HRM for my Edge 305. I received a Forerunner 301 HRM which will not sync to my Edge. My item came from Long Trading Inc. To the seller's credit he has contacted me and return will be made with full credit including S&H.
2,I returned it!,"I have been using Norelco for 38 years (followed my Grandfather and Dad). But the last $50 Norelco was not that good, so I tried the Titanium Ultra R-9170. Right from the start I had problems -- very poor design: hard to turn on (often takes several times) and it's awkward to remove the top for cleaning. Plus the hinge will probably break. And that's the good news. Now for the bad -- the R-9170 does not come close to Norelco's for a close shave. Even shaving longer does not help. Plus, the after shave irritation alone deserves a return. The R-9170 cost more than the $50 Norelco and I'll take that crummy Norelco anyday!"
3,Capable but it takes time,"I purchased this at Sears for $70 after my Norelco battery gave out after 15 years (yup, 15 years), and there is no way this is worth that kind of investment, but at $35 its probably an OK buy. The manual says the shave gets better after a few weeks to allow your skin to adjust to the razor, and they are correct. Out of the box this razor was a big disappointment, but after a couple of weeks I noticed a lot of improvement. If I had it to do over again, I would have read reviews more carefully and spent $50-$60 to get a really great razor. This one screams average, although washing it out with water from the tap is a nice convenience I've never had before with an electric razor."
5,Good one,I have been using this shaver for more than 6 months and it works perfectly. The shaving is very smooth. It can be used for a month after a full battery charge. I really like it.
3,"OK, but......","The Remington R-9170 is an OK shaver, but I have used better. After more than 7 weeks, still am getting rough shave. Other features are nice. Cordless power is good and runs shaver for a long time. Recharge light works good in letting you know when to recharge. Recharging is just a simple plug in. Would not rebuy this model."
3,Not as Good as Norelco,This is a good imitation of the Norelco rotary shaver and it costs less for someone who is price conscious.
2,Reasonable shave but short battery life,"I've liked my R-9170 for the past year that I've been using it. The closeness is OK, probably the best I've ever gotten from an electric shaver but nowhere near as close as a blade shave. But the real disappointment is that battery life is short, and it is not designed to be user-replaceable. Now even when I use it corded, there are times when it acts as though it is out of power & doesn't want to shave. That is a real disappointment. I didn't expect to be back in the marker for a shaver after only a year. I'd avoid this unit, and at least look for one with replaceable batteries."
1,Remington R 9170,"Would not buy again. Rough on your face, short battery cycle and not very good shaving job in general"
2,Poor Quality,"Got mine as XMAS gift 2005, in less than a year the silver paint on the razor head began to fade off. Ordered another from Remington with the correct part number and they sent me a bronze color razor head for my silver shaver. Called customer service and made lame excuse asking me to go to return it for a refund. Return postage would have cost more than the part. BUY NORELCO."
2,Stay with the Razor. It's much better,"After several attempts to use it over a period of two weeks, I gave up and went back to Gillette M3. The manual says that after few days you will get used to the power shaver, but after several tries and skin irritation, I'm back to the good old razor."
1,Terrible for your skin. Bad judgement on my part.,"I bought this razor because i expected remington razors to preform. When i received this product my first experinace was horrid. First time i shaved with it, it left rashes, scratched and injured skin on my neck. I have never had razor burns that bad. My mach 3 is just so much better then this terrible product. I reccommend against buying this product."
3,Price too high for a disposable unit.,"This unit is disposable. The NiCad batteries wouldn't hold a charge after about 1.5 years, and were not designed to be serviceable. When it did work, it worked well. Basic, no whistles or bells, but over priced given it's longevity."
1,Worse than older models,"1.VERY short battery life--battery dead after aprox. 10 medium shaves2.Battery indicator inaccurate, asks for re-charge after aprox. 5 medium shaves3.Release button for clippers too low on shaver-- holding shaver normally triggers the opening of the clippers4.Badly designed releases for shaver head --one needs to press two buttons simultaneously--very inconvenient"
3,"ok, first few shaves are somewhat painful, then it is smooth","Overall, satisfied with its performance..............no problem until now.........."
2,"GOOD SHAVE , BUT TOO FRAGILE,","I have used Remington for 25 years but R 9170 gives a very good shave but head components and hinges are plastic!!! Was going to buy two because price was very good, but plastic components and hinges made me change my mind. Decided to buy new blades for my old remington!!!!!"
4,Me gusta,"Es la segunda rasuradora que compro y la primera de Remington, y no tengo quejas al respecto. Es muy facil de usar y como destaca el manual la primera afeitada no es muy buena pero luego la cara se va acostumbrando. La cabeza es muy fragil y parece que se puede romper. no hay instructivo de como lavarla con agua (una grafica por ejemplo)Se carga rapido y es silenciosa. tengo dos semansa con ella y no tengo quejas."
4,New to cordless shaving,I bought the Remington R-9170 and like it. It holds a charge for a long time and is easy to clean. It does take about 2 weeks of use to stop the initial skin irritation but it was stated in the brochure. It recharges very quickly.
1,Don't buy this...,"This product was total waste of money for me. Thought of returning, but since I used it once with out success, and to prevent use by other person, I kept it."
2,Lame design - failure model,"It does not shave smooth. After you shave, you will still feel like you have sheved a day before, not just now. Each time after I shave with it my skin itches for a while, especially under the lower lip.I don't recommend this product at all."
3,Remington R-9170 Titanium Microflex Ultra,"Thought the motor would be stronger. Seems weak compared to Norelco. Other than that, seems to be a good electric razor."
5,BEST SHAVER I'VE OWNED !!!,"I have used a Norelco, a Schick, and various other shavers,and this R-9170 has them all beat. The shaver is well designed for easy handling and cleaning, while delivering a comfortable,close shave.The item was delivered using Super Saver Shipping (free),and I received it within three days. You just can't beat theservice ! I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and will certainly use Amazon.com again."
5,"A comprehensive, informative, reliable coverage.","Fibroids covers the many treatments now available for fibroids, from alternative therapies to conventional treatments, and provides a wealth of considerations and options for women who have been diagnosed with fibroids. From common misconceptions to the long-term effects of fibroids, Fibroids provides a comprehensive coverage long overdue in the health field."
1,This book was terrible,The author of this book is a SELF-PROCLAIMED expert. much of what he says is utter nonsense and on further research I discovered that the schools being promoted are the schools he himpself owns.BEWARE!
4,As advertised,"We thought these would be perfect, but the ones without the thumb support work better. Our doc said to purchase something with thumb support, but the thumb support didn't alleviate the tendinitis as well as the ones without thumb support."
1,New heads and cutters cost,"If you buy replacement cutters and heads they cost about they same as shaver almost does. And my shaver goes through 3 heads a year. Also leaves face dirty after shaving,don't try wet shaving either. Wouldn't buy again any Remington."
2,1700 titanium 3 microscreen ultra,"When I received my Remington 1700, I pluged it in for a day, then I shaved with it. I felt it was a very good shave, cut the whiskers fast and seemed to be a close shave. After shaving with it about four days I noticed hairs (Whiskers) close to 3/8 - 1/2 inch long under my chin, they seemed to be fine hairs and the shaver just would not cut them off. There was a lot of them and I finally had to raise trimmer and use it to cut them off. I would not recommend this over a rotory shaver. My old rotory shaver wore out but it did a much better job ."
3,It was ok,"My beard is maybe too tough for this razor, Wore out blades and screen sooner than I would think it should"
1,It did not work,It did not work. The battery will not charge and cannot be replaced as it is a sealed unit. Is there a possiblilty I can get a replacement?
1,Don't buy any remington,"I have a new Reminton that is soooo bad I dread to shave with it. I think it was designed to remove peach fuzz from little girls legs. Please, don't buy these as gifts for anyone (man). Well as childrens toy would be okay. Oh! I gave it one stare because that was the lowest number allowed."
4,Great little razor!,"I ordered this razor for my husband as a Christmas gift on 12/18 and it arrived with time to spare. He is very pleased with the peformance and the shave he receives. The one thing that would make it even better is a low battery indicator light instead of the razor just dying when it needs to be recharged. Other than that, he likes it much better than his Braun and it's perfect for the price!"
4,Good Shaver,"I have not used an electric shaver in many years, about 30 or so, and decided I would give this one a try. I was most surprised that it did not irritate my skin like the old electric shavers did and how smooth it shaved. I like it and feel it performs well."
4,"Very good shaver, but.......","......you cannot use it while it is recharging. IMO, this is a drawback to the shaver, though perhaps not enough to dissuade a potential buyer from purchasing one as it works very well. The pop-up trimmer does a fine job for long hair. For the current $39 price(I paid $50+), I think you will have a hard time beating the value this shaver presents overall.Overall, it is highly receommended."
3,Not even close to Braun...,"I had been using Braun electric shavers since college and had been happy with them. It was time to replace one and I stumbled upon the Remington for a great price. It looked similar to the Braun shavers that I had so much luck with so I bought it.Let's just say that I replaced this Remington less than a year after buying it. Not because it broke, or needed repair. More because it was just not very good. It routinely missed hairs on my neck and along the lower jaw bone. The trimmer part was aweful, often times cutting me.I've replaced it with a new Braun and have re-discovered why I switched to electric razors in the first place!"
2,It doesn't work that great for me.,"I have had an electric Remington shaver in the past, and I though that this triple microscreen would be better than my single larger, microscreen. I was wrong. This model does not shave my beard as well as the single. I have to stretch my skin a lot to get a close shave. In fact, I have found that I have to go over my skin with a hand razor to catch all the small spots.Also, its quite loud. Its noisier than my single screen model. I got a great deal on this shaver, but I do not think I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Remington quality is not the best in the world.,"I bought a Remington Shaver before. 2 weeks after I bought it - it stopped working. I decided to give it a try again. I bought another Remington. Guess what?! It worked for a couple of weeks and once again - I plug it into the wall and the LED that indicates charging battery doesn't light up. The result is that I am once again disappointed with the quality of Remington shavers.Thank God, Amazon sent me a replacement. I would be stuck with a non-working NEW shaver otherwise."
2,fleeting result!,"I give it more than one star for packaging and texture of product. However, this product clogged my pores. It didn't perfect anything for me. The algae ingredient that it contains just fills in the very fine lines and when you wash your face you see the lines again. So problems doesn't go away, it just seems to cover it up."
1,only one good song,"I was disappointed when I received this disc and the only good song on it was ""Let Me Go"". The rest sucked."
3,Where's the stuff about Curt Swan?,"I thought this would have more info about Curt Swan's life but halfway through the book I find that they are still talking about which comics he did with which inker. While all of that is interesting, I have always wondered about Mr. Swan as a person. Who did he base his Superman on? What did he use for inspiration? One interesting piece of information is that he was self taught as an artist. WOW!I see now from the title that it says ""a life in comics,"" but I tight they would talk some about the artist himself.All in all, interesting for the Swan fan, as I am, but a little disappointing in that it's superficial."
3,"OK, nice","An OK nice book, a little too much on the social commentary side. Facts and history of the show are sort of buried within author's personal ideas, viewpoints, stories etc. For someone just interested in the history of the series, it could have been clearer, more concise, more direct. But the author is very deeply, personally involved with the show, you can tell, so he devotes much thought to every nuance. Episode guide too long, bios took up too many pages, I mean I really didn't need or want to know about EVERY writer, or crew member. Seemed like some stuff was just put in to create pages."
3,gone too chaotic,"Galaxy Angel X is not quite as good as the earlier series, getting more chaotic and having even less to do with the series theme (military girls) then ever. Some of the stories are borderline unintelligible. But what is truly annoying is that after three sets (Galaxy Angel, GA A, and GA Z) this set only has the same actresses in English for the first third of the series. Suddenly for the other two disks there is only English subtitles. After you have gotten used to the English actresses, it is hard to tell which one is speaking at times since the Japanese voices often sound too similar to easily tell apart, and are often so radically different from the sound, speech pattern and vocal personality of the English speakers."
2,Only 1/3 of a dub?????!!!!!,"Was glad to finally get the last series of the great Galaxy Angel anime in one box set. Unlike Galaxy Angel A which was first split up into a box set, then as AA for the second half, all of ""X"" is in a single 3-disc set. However, for some reason, only the first 8 episodes are actually dubbed. Each ""episode"" of Galaxy Angel X is 1 long episode with 2 mini-sodes which count as 2 seperate episodes. This makes for 4 on the first 2 discs & 5 on the last one. The first disc has both English & Japanese tracks, featuring most of the original voice actors from the previous GA dubs except for a new actress playing Rampha. The other two are in Japanese only, with no dub. I don't know why it was put out like this, or why they only bothered to do it with only 1/3 of it dubbed, but it seems profoundly lazy, like it was taken up by Bandai Visual for the last 2/3 of the show. There's no explanation given other than Bandai maybe just ran out of money for it."
3,Galaxy Angel X,"Well this is not a bad series if you been sticking around for this long with it like I have. It contains the final 13 episodes, I think the series has a weird way of numbering episodes like it having one normal episode and two mini episodes of the series. The only problem that I had was that my friend is not a sub fan and prefers the dub of most anime series and that was fine for the first disk but the rest is not dubbed over so he could not enjoy it as much. I say by this as part of your collection if you have keeping up with this series but if you are new get the first one and see if you like it. Well this is everything that i have to say about it."
2,Rushed,"Ottawa's Sue Foley recorded ""New Used Car"" for Germany's Ruf label. The set showcases Foley's exquisite guitar playing. As a vocalist, her voice is a bit on the thin side but usually works when filled with attitude and swagger. Unfortunately, Foley's songwriting on this set is not memorable. Yes, the title track has some nice playing. ""Mother"" might have been stunning as an instrumental. ""Sugar"" has potential with its saucy innuendo. A couple dreadful tracks like ""Little Things"" & ""Found My Love"" have me reach for the skip button when her talk-sing part approaches. ""Deep Freeze"" near the end of the set is the only track I want to put into my song mix rotation. The last track ""Change Your Mind"" sounds like ""Baby, Let Me Follow You Down"" from Bob Dylan's first album in 1962. The song Dylan sang was more interesting. While Foley's talent is still evident, this set seems like it was rushed, not quite ready for the studio. Taxi!"
3,"More ""Now"" than ""Then""","I would have rather seen more ""then"" than ""now"" but it was the other way around. With all the Lawrence Welk Show years on TV, there was no shortage of available material, they just didn't use much of it."
2,It still sinks,"Written by a survivor of the Titanic and done so in 1912 language. It is not an easy read and is slow going. It does, however, offer an insight into the Titanic disaster that only a survivor can give."
2,titanic:a survivors story,it seemed to be very repetittive-- i got bored with it after a while--the same stories just repeted on and on--
2,A Survivor's Account of the Sinking of the Titanic,"I made allowances for the old-style of writing...the real value is that this was the freshest account of the disaster by an adult male survivor. Other than that, it can't compare to the well-written tales from Stanley Lord, A Night to Remember."
5,sometimes the greatest music gets lost,"in the mid seventies, this singer and her eclectic band kept me and my 'hipper-than-thou' music friends entertained bigtime. an album that truly escaped, it may be the greatest record of 1977, or 1976 if you were lucky enough to get a shortlived copy on buddah, before a warner music version appeared out of nowhere. Cathy reminds one of Janis, Bette, and yeah a young ethel merman (don't let that reference freak you out). this album is magic, as the best music is."
4,fanny lifter is great!,"For those of us who gain all our weight in our lower body, this system is great. The abs tape leaves something to be desired...not quite tough enough for me. Your heart rate will not get up quite high enough with any of the tapes to take the place of a good cario workout, but to sculpt your legs, this system is great"
5,Pure adrenaline!,"I've been a firm follower for about 4 years and was a little skeptical of the ""new"" firm videos. I have to say that the new firm videos deliver exactly what the earlier '90s videos promise-visible results within 10 workouts. The level of physical conditioning I have attained in less than 10 workouts is amazing. I am completely sold!"
5,"Effective, motivating workout","I enjoy the aerobics and weights classes at my gym more than working out without an instructor. I bought this system because I didn't want to continue to spend on gym classes. The cardio and body sculpt workouts are very similar to my gym workouts, although about 10 minutes shorter. However, they work-- I can feel the difference in my energy levels and strength after about 8 workouts. I have also lost nearly an inch off my waist.I do have some complaints-- the ab workout video isn't very challenging. The warmup is too long and overall, it feels about 2-3 exercises too short. I pause the video in places and do an extra set or two of the exercises. The other two workouts are moderately challenging. All the workouts are enjoyable. The fanny lifter serves its purpose-- I feel comfortable using it. I'd like to find more workouts that use the fanny lifter. Any suggestions?"
5,Great for home arobics,I luv all the firm workouts. I use the fannylifter with other firm workout DVDs that I own. My clothes are baggy after 2 weeks of using the DVD's
2,The Firm Sculpting System,"The first time I did this video I was in pain for three days. Each time I exercised to this video it got easier, but I don't have fun. I have nowhere to put the ""fanny lifter"" steps that I didn't realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table. If I could do it over I wouldn't buy this product, however, you will get an excellent workout. If you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video. (There is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video.)"
4,Good Workout,"Good workout, but I prefer higher impact. Instructors are easy to follow and provide good information for upcoming moves and combinations."
2,The Firm,"Intense work out video.My cardio is usually walking, treadmill and stationary bike, so I thought this would be a fun way to mix things up while getting the benefit of strength training.As someone who has never taken an aerobics class, I found the pace too quick for a beginner, and the sessions too long. The instructor you should follow for beginner level is rarely in view during each workout.The only result I have obtained is lots of frustration.If your experienced and can pick up easily you will probably love this series."
2,the firm,i did not like this product all that much. from the product info i thought that this would be for beginners but after only one try of this i realized that it is not. i have never worked out to a firm video so that might have been my 1st mistake. the instructor does not stop to explain anything or even do the moves slow enough so you can learn how to do it. she just goes right into it. i think before i attempt it again i will watch the video and then see what i can do.
2,not what I expected,"These are the short benches not the long ones that advertise on Television. The cardio video is entirely too fast. I teach aerobics twice a day and it's way too fast for a beginner even an advanced learner couldn't keep up. Also, the music is really boring. I use the benches for my own individual exercises not with the dvd."
1,Nope...,If you like books that have the same conversations over and over and the same situations over and over... this is for you. I was very dissapointed with this book. I kept reading and reading hoping it would get better. Please don't waste your time on this.
5,This is the only romance novel I'd need on a desert island!,"""Hearts Aflame"" is J.Lindsey at her Ultimate Best! I'll always have a strong attachment to this book because it was the first romance novel I read, which I then read, read, and re-read again. The characters of Kristen and Royce are interesting and well-developed, the dialogue is fast and inflaming--words which also well describe the ""love"" scenes, and luckily, the plot doesn't meander much into the inane (which can't always be said for a good deal of the storylines in this genre). If I haven't praised this book enough and you need more assurance to purchase it, the review from Aerin in Seattle is dead-on!"
2,Not one of my favorites,"Johanna Lindsey has written so many biomechanics couple slip through harbor feel are ""run of the mill"" without good character development and a long story that could have been cut in half- for me this was one of those books"
5,Great romance,This was the one book of the Haardrad family I missed and I am glad I finally read it. Made me go back and read the others.
5,So good I remember it years after the fact,"I don't know exactly what it is, but this book (and this trilogy) is so good that I remember loving it almost 15 years after reading it! The review by ellejir ""ellejir"" is right on."
5,Kristen is one of my favorite heroines!,This is a wonderful novel. It's funny with lots of little secrets you can't wait to see unfold. Kristen is one of my favorite heroines. It is refreshing to see a strong heroine who can save herself. The novel is full of wonderful characters. It's a hard book to put down. I've read it five times already.
5,Fantastic,Johanna Lindsey was definitely on her game when she wrote this book. It is so much in the same tone as the previous viking novel. the character development was wonderful!
1,Lame,"While this book had an intriguing start, it evolved into a rather poor excuse of a romance. Kristen is such a strong heroine, yet she keeps giving in to sleeping with the ""handsome strong"" Royce. not only that, I found both of their characters odd and somewhat unbelievable. Anyway, this doesn't seem to be a book for the jaded or bored romance reader. If you love a bit of will-bending and submission, I guess this is for you."
5,Lindsay's Best!,"Hearts Aflame impressed me as one of the most honest presentations of the agony and ecstacy of love ever. Kristen is so refreshing as someone who can be very capable, strong and independent without being bossy, bitchy or manly! She's able to keep her femininity and still be stong and honorable. And Royce - what can I say - he was my first crush! This book is excellent. I've loaned it to all my friends and still read it every year!"
5,One for the Keeper Shelf,"Vikings and Lindsey - an unbeatable combination!If you haven't yet read this delightful book, it's truly one not to be missed."
4,I had forgotten how good her writing was.....,"I used to looove her books but than it got to a point where to much ""rape"" type sex and stuff was going on for my liking. This is one of the earlier books I so liked. It has just the right amount of everything. I really enjoyed it even though I' m sure I had read it before. This is an altogether different type of romance than the typical Scotland/England theme. Read it and decide for your self. I LIKED IT!!!"
4,A Great Viking Romance,This is definitely one of my favorite Johanna Lindsey books. I couldn't put it down! The sexual tension between the hero and heroine is wonderfully portrayed. They want each other...they don't want to admit it to themselves or to each other...they fight...they fight some more...and eventually the tension between them explodes into passion. If you like viking romances...then why haven't you read this book yet? :)
5,Hearts Aflame,A MUST READ. This book is the second in a 3 book series by Lindsey and it was fabulous. I read this one before the first book but I still enjoyed it. It is romantic and true to its time frame. I will read this multiple times!
5,Kristen is my hero!,"I have read more than 20 Johanna Lindsey's books and without a doubt this was my favorite. There was a lot of thought for detail and was a don't put down book. One of the few books I have read more than twice. I recomend this book to anyone that likes a strong character and a women that does not take crap from her man. Or anyone else for that matter! Johanna should be proud of KRISTEN, the greatest character she ever created."
5,Great Book!,"This book looked like a good value for the money, so I picked it up. Within ten minutes I had learned how to do ten new things with my iPod that I wasn't even aware were possible. Talk about an instant reference... Recommended."
2,Disappointed in myself,"I bought this book recently as I wanted to learn even more about probably the greatest, most enduring gadget of this generation. Unfortunately, and I entirely blame myself for not reading further, the book is about 24-30 months out of date. This, in gadgetry terms, is aeons. Nonetheless, I found one or two things I didn't already know, so it wasn't entirely wasted. I guess what is really needed is an updated version to take in the latest ipod developments."
5,Purchased for my wife..,I purchased this for my wife so that she could better understand her iPod and iTunes. My wife is happy with this product and therefore I am happy with this product.. Need I say more..??
1,Don't waste your money.,Three hours of reading and I still feel helpless with my I-touch. I am a collage grad. I've read text books that are better written.
1,RANGE SUCKS,My dog weighs 12.5 lbs. I bought this collar for its weight and size. This unit is small but the range is not more than about 50 feet. It has 4 levels and it usually has to be put on level 4 to get my dogs attention. It is very unreliable. I would pay 200.00 for a shock collar that would always perform. The units collar and remote battery was DOA and I had to buy a new ones. I put the collar on my arm. You can hear the good/bad tone when you press the button but no shock on 1 or 2 and 3 is so mild until you get to level 4 it is useless. Level 4 will get your dogs attention as it will make him yelp with pain. If you get much beyond 20 to 50 feet it usually will not work. I would not buy this product again. My cars remote will work much farther than this collar.
1,stopped working,the collor only worked a few weeks. I could not get it to work. I tried changing out batteries. Nothing. I would not recommend this product. This makes the 2nd collor of this type I have purchased that has quite working. I which it did because it would have been good.
2,Works well 5' from dog.,"If you want to stand next to the dog to give corrections; then this trainer is for you. If, however, you wish to correct behaviors from a distance greater than 5' then you might want to research another unit. I will say this positive. When the transmitter and receiver do communicate, this is an excellent training tool."
1,Too strong and big for Toy Breeds,"I bought two of these for our two miniature pinschers they have short hair and are very small (about 5-7 lbs) I read that this is the one and only for toy breeds. One of the collars did not work even after replacing the batteries. The other collar we used the ""1"" setting which is the lightest setting and it made our dog yelp so loud and jump like it hurt so bad. Our dog was shaking and hid under our foot stool and was traumatized. This is not in his nature to be a wussy, min pins are considered tough and the ""King of Toy"" breeds. In the instructions it said a response like that means the setting is too high and may be harmful. The training DVD was not helpful it was based on a different larger product with different controls and for large breeds. This product is too powerful for dogs so tiny. Oh and even though its small the shock device was still so big that my dog could not look down because it took up his whole front of his neck."
1,Bad Product,"Bad Product - It didn't work! No matter how many times we tried to program it, the item simply never worked!"
1,Disappointed,"I have had this for about 6 months now and the 1 and 2 buttons on the remote do not work. I have changed the batteries in both the remote and the receiver, but still they do not work. However, the 3 and 4 buttons work, but that is WAY too powerful for my Westie-poo. Also if you buy this from amazon it voids the warranty (I wish I knew where that conspicuous disclosure regarding the warranty was...), so I will have to fork out another 100 bucks or so for a new one..."
4,Works Very Well,"This collar has worked wonders for my small dog. She was a runner and despite all of our efforts to teach her otherwise, we broke down and got this collar. What a difference it has made. The battery life is not the greatest, but considering the results we've seen, it's well worth the money. We removed the collar for a week to test if she would listen without it. She did well, but began reverting to her old ""run like the wind"" mentality at day 6. The collar went back on and all is well again. We now do 3 days on, 4 days off. You want to teach your dog to listen to you, not just the collar. Just the noise is enough to stop her at this point. No zap is needed at this point. Very pleased with this product!"
1,This product is garbage,"I bought two of these for my miniature poodles. To sum it up: This product stinks. The range is horrible. It doesn't work from across the room. It doesn't work in sunlight. It doesn't work from in a doorway. It doesn't work from in the hall. You get the picture. If you need to correct your dog you have to be right next to him... and then it still doesn't work sometimes. Everyone knows that the key to training a dog is consistency, and how are you supposed to be consistent with such a sporadic product? Bonus surprise: You can't use two of these at once. They use separate codes for each unit but the signals interfere with each other and they are sporadic at best.I am returning mine, and I would never recommend this product to anyone. I won't even bother mentioning what's good about this product because it is so fundamentally defective.You cannot train a dog with this product."
2,I thought I could do it ...,"If you do not mind zapping your dog - this is a great product. But, my puggle puppy just broke my heart with the way that she reacted that I just could not continue to use this. The batteries died almost instantly.She cowered in the corner any time I wanted to put this collar on her and it just seemed to change her personality overnight.Overall - I hated this and for a dog lover- I just can not recommend it.For someone who doesn't mind a dog screeching ... it is probably just what you are looking for."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!,Don't buy this product! I bought it and used it just twice: once on level 1 and once on level 2(It goes up to level 4). It left 2 burn marks where the probes touched my dog's fur. Don't put your dogs through the torture.Thanks
5,Very Pleased With This Product,"I have a very high energy stubborn Westie. The Lap Dog model works well. It only has 4 levels of stimulation. I tried it on my arm and found that level 2 was all I would use on her and it works. I like the options available. I chose to have the ""bad tone"" sound just before the stimulation. After only a couple of times stimulating her, she responds only to the tone and doesn't need the stimulation.My husband thought it was cruel until he saw how it works. Now he is a believer. It is like any tool, if used properly it is not cruel or harmful.Thank you."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Amazon did their part well. The collar came when is was supposed to and was packaged very well. The collar however, did not work, so I called the manufacturer. Very nice phone conversation, and after 13 days received a replacement, THAT DOESN'T WORK. Please, please don't waste your money and time on this."
2,Not very sturdy,"Upon opening this product it was very hard to get it to work...""On"" button on collar had to be jiggled, remote unit buttons often had to be pushed multiple times for reaction, etc. A friend had the same one and it worked flawlessly, so my unit is a lemon. I will be returning it."
1,Innotek Customer Service Condescending,"Batteries are stuck in the cap, I have had 4 people try to get them out. I called customer service and the agent, was condescending.Told me he ""bet I could get them out"".Or I could purchase a new cap with batteries as it was an accessories item. If it is defective from the start it should be replaced free of charge."
3,"Questionable design, Great Customer Service, Ultimately Happy","Be very careful with the product initially understanding exactly how the receiver batter case opens, and how to turn it on.Even when you do it correctly you run the risk of breaking off the tabs that hold the cap on.I had multiple problems with mine initially and Innotek was great about working through it with me and sending a replacement with a return envelop.I would recommend the device - the low shock level is pretty low, but on 4 it is certainly effective."
1,never worked,"This did not work from day one. I did try everything new battery, I did exactly what the instructions ask me to and it still doesn't work."
2,Better devices for the price,"This product is OK. I have had it for a year, and it no longer works. It worked pretty good, but it was inconsistent, and the build quality is not great. The button on the remote pushed through, the screw in battery holder is awkward and it stripped, the case itself needed to be taped together.It worked from a short range only. Most of the ones on the market will work 100ft min. This one was 20ft at best. I would recommend one from sportdog or another brand.If this was $50, it would be worth it."
2,LapDog trainer,"this collar worked the first couple of times we used it, but after that..nothing...he didn't even turn and look at us."
2,Didn't work,"I was excited to try this collar on our Maltese dog we inherited. I am very disappointed as it has not deterred him one bit.Would like to return it, but not sure I'm still in the allowable time frame. I really wanted it to work, so kept trying."
1,Does not work very long,"I only used this for about a month tops on my pug who has short fur and it stopped working. We changed all the batteries and made sure the remote and the collar were synchronized and everything and it still didn't work. It never got wet or anything, it's just a piece of crap. Spend the money to get something a little better that will actually work longer."
2,Average.,"Bought this book for my Global Communications grad class. My teacher apologized to us the first month of class for the book, saying she couldn't find anything better for us within the time frame she was allowed to pick her text. We don't follow the book closely; she calls the book ""theory to expand upon"".As I read, I go through the text and correct the grammatical errors, run-on sentences, one-sentence paragraphs, and I cross out the irrelevant information as well. Other than the unnecessary grammar issues, I find that the author is very dry and one-note. For a communications textbook, the bulk of it is just bad writing. The few images which are included are pointless - they aren't photos, they are vector images of things such as satellites orbiting Earth.I give it two stars because there IS some important information in the book, if you can pick it out of the rest of the junk."
4,excellent,"Jesus. What were these guys taking between albums? Their first,We Are Ever So Cleanwas quintesessential psychadelic whimsey brit pop, with all the post-Pepper trimmings.If Only For A Moment is a COMPLETELY different story. This has some of the hardest rock of the era. ""Peace Loving Man"" rocks as hard and the riffs slam as heavy as anything of Led Zeppilin II. ""Billy Blue"" has knotty clusters that pre-date Physical Grafetti by six years.Blossom Toes have some more subtle, jazzier material here, and also work with art rock time changes that were moving through the underground of the late 1960s English rock scene.Both this band's albums are great, but for entirely differant reasons. Get both. It is like getting two bands for the price of one."
1,Not worth your time,"I am sitting here in shock while reading the great reviews this movie has received. This movie was horrible. If I could, I wouldn't give this movie ANY stars. The title suggests this is a movie about a horse, but it isn't. There is a horse in the movie and that's about it. The actors could not act, characters come in and out of the story with no rhyme or reason, and the whole story would have been pointless if the father character would have performed some actual parenting. The ""bad guy"" was apparently a threat only to himself. Please do not waste your time. If you need a good movie with horses, watch Hidalgo."
2,A feel-good hippo-therapy movie,"Wind Dancer starts off a little shaky, but if you can put that aside, you'll find you're watching a movie that in many regards, closely resembles a mixing ofThe Horse WhispererandFlicka.Frankly, Paige (Raeanin Simpson) in Wind Dancer can't hold a candle to Grace (Scarlett Johansson) in The Horse Whisperer, nor to Katy (Alison Lohman) in Flicka. She's not particularly likeable, nor terribly compelling. The therapist, Susan Allen (Mel Harris) lacks the charm of Tom Booker (Robert Redford, The Horse Whisperer), but does serve as a stubborn foil to a reluctant Paige.Older viewers should probably skip this movie in favor of the grittier, starker presentation of The Horse Whisperer.Still, for children, Wind Dancer's generally lighter feel may be more suitable than The Horse Whisperer, and may offer parents an opportunity to discuss the conquering of fears and disabilities without deeply upsetting them."
2,Not Too Great,"I didn't abhor this movie, it's just not the best. The music is sad and annoying and the main character isn't likeable.It's simply about a girl who falls off a horse and injures herself because she didn't listen to her dad who told her not to ride if she was sick.So she has to learn trust and hard work....things like that from a therapist who lives with her at the family ranch. There's a lot of predictable elements and the movie leaves a slightly bad after taste."
5,great shave,great shaver...my son gets a great shave without any nicks...loves it..would order it again and from this company...received quickly and was very pleased..thank you
1,Worst razer ever,This is my first Remington shaver I have ever owned and the last one to.A close shave is one that you cannot feel stubble when you push your finger against the direction of beard growth. This shaver did not shave close. It takes too much time to shave.It is fairly quiet.The battery longevity is average.Construction quality is average for the price range.I rate it 1 star overall. I will not replace the cutting head when it wears out but will discard the shaver.
4,Does the job and no complaints,My husband has been using this product for 2 weeks now and I haven't heard anything negative from him. This must mean that the shaver does a good job otherwise I would have heard about it. The only thing I notice is that it is a bit louder when in use--a steady drone. The shave is nice and has definitely met our needs thus far.
5,A great product!,"This is a great shaver. If you are in the market for one, considered the Remington R-960. I am of Afro-American descent and was very skeptical about buying a rotary we shaver. I had always gotten excellent results using Remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug. With its ergonomic design, it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas. I had considered purchasing that of another brand until I discovered that Remington makes one and now... I'm loving it!"
2,Disappointed,"Odd fat boomerang shape, hard to get access to cutters, hard to clean, on-off switch is almost flush to razor and very hard to turn on and off. Shave is marginal. I much prefer tne Remington TA4570."
2,My Remington R960 died today,"So, I travel internationally a lot. I was coming home from Korea and stopped in Hawaii in August of 2004 and my 11 year old Norelco died. I bought this R960 Remington at Walmart for $80 then. I have had it ever since and it worked fine. Most of the time I have used it with the cord plugged in, not needing the battery feature. Now the shaver won't even start, no lights, no nothing. I can only assume the battery circut has malfunctioned. Needing a shaver immediately and being back in Korea I have bought a Philips made in Europe. I did not get enough service life from the Remington, considering my Norelco's excess of 11 years. Bye, bye Remington... too bad though. I kind of got used to it. Update....I disassembled the Remington and removed the battery completly. Now the Remington works on the power cord and continues to give good service. I really hated the Philips."
5,Best Shaver I've Ever Used,"Over the past 50 years I have used every type of electric shaver made and almost every brand, including Remington Micro, Norelco, Braun et al.. Without question, this is the very best of them all. Admittidly, it does require a break-in period. But within a short time it does an excellent job. One of it's plusses and a secret to comfortable use, is that it shaves closely with a very light touch. Pressing down hard, as we usually need to do with other shavers, causes irritation and burn.My advice to the ""chain-saw"" guy who used it once and set it aside, is give it a try, use it lightly, and I think you find it's a great tool.I've been using it for 3 years and when I accidently broke the clipper, I immediately bought a new one. I recently bought one for my 50 year old son, who also thinks it's great."
2,not that great,"holds a charge well, but thats about it.head doesn't pivot that much at all. doesnt ""lift n' cut"" hair as well as my norelco did. i would have to shave every 1.5 days with this, as opposed to 3-4 with other shavers. shave would also take longer than a conventional razor with shaving cream. i had to ""carve"" out a close shave. not worth it.left area under my chin and my neck very irritated.skip this razor & spend the extra few dollars on something that will get the job done."
4,The Doctor and Stella -good movies,"Havent seen Roomates yet so no-comment on that one. But, The Doctor should be required viewing for any Doctor who needs to understand -what it is to be a patient. I think there are too many Doc's out there that need a serious course in bedside manners. Stella is a great movie, Bette Midler always portrays believable characters."
4,Finally got The Doctor,Frankly ordeder the DVD to get the Doctor at a reasonable price. Stella was O. K. Haven't seen Roommates yet
3,Get this series while it's still available...,"Oglio records was one of the early labels to bring us hard to find new wave 12"" singles on compilations, and few labels have managed to keep up with it. Get them before sellers start charging ridiculous prices for them. This volume is not my favorite-it has too many 7"" versions, and chose Wide Boy Awake's ""Chicken Outlaw"" over the 12"" of Slang Teacher!!! Bummer. Track times:1. send me an angel (5:40) (the ORIGINAL 12"", not the 1989 remix)2. Telephone operator (3:15)3. 867-5309 (3:44)4. Overkill (3:43)5. Hero takes a fall (2:52)6. Ghost in you (4:15)7. Acceleration (6:32)8. A million miles away (3:33)9. Make a circuit with me (2:51) (this actually IS the ""extended"" version!)10. Just got lucky (4:42)11. Samson and Delilah (5:16)12. Chicken outlaw (5:16)"
4,"Very nice, but small for size...","I thought this bustier was very pretty when I got it. But, even though in everything else I'm a 36DDD, it was too small and would have needed a 38DDD. The reason I returned it without exchanging was that it was too tall for my dress, and wouldn't have worked, being the right size or not. (that's just a chance you take when ordering online). Other than running small, it was well made and very pretty for being a simple bustier."
2,Bustier,"The shipping was good but I have to say that I am not impressed with the product at all. It is not at all of the quality that I had hoped for. It is thin and flimsy and not good at all for someone of my size, despite it being for my size. It is not comfortable, attractive or flattering. The material is cheap as is the construction and it almost felt used. I was very disappointed, especially after what I spent."
3,Band size too big,"The bra itself is pretty and would fit perfectly, except the band width on me was way to big (32D). I can't get it in a smaller size, so I'll be returning it."
4,long line corset strapless bra,Fit perfect true to size made my outfit look beautiful no lines under my dress...enhanced my shapes showed my curves as I am very slim it made me look shapely and gorgeous
2,Boring and out of date,I found this book to be a sort of boring story of the life of Clark Gable. Also there has been information about Clark Gable that makes this book out of date.The book hardly mentions Loretta Young and in the early 1990's it came out that Clark Gable and Loretta Young had a secret love child. Instead of this I would recommend the biography by Warren Harris instead. It is more up to date
3,Kings should live forever,"I wish Clark Gable had lived long enough to have a real biography. This compilation is a bit second rate. The reader can't be certain of validity, throughout the book. That said, it is till worth the read. Who wouldn't want to see more photos of Clark Gable! So, you wish there were more, though it includes a good number of photos. I haven't finished the whole book yet--almost half way. My concern stems from the 'twist' on some of the text, that seems to cheapen the character of Gable with a two sided sword. If that wasn't the intention, then it is poorly written."
5,Refreshing and Invigorating!,"What an amazing album! Other CD's come and go in my changer, but I have no interest in pulling this one. It's been in there over a year! Piano solos simply don't get any better than this."
5,If there was a 6th star as an option I would choose it.,"When it comes to smooth jazz there isn't a CD that I have found to date that can match this one. I have a fair Jazz CD collection but by far this CD is my favourite. The music is superb and no one, jazz lover or not, can say that this isn't quality."
2,Unimpressive,"I bought this CD after having listened to samples of the cuts on Amazon.com and because it was reviewed so highly. Perhaps I expected too much, but it just seemed ordinary to me. There was no originality there at all. If I could get my money back, I would."
1,I did not realize it was a cassette. Probably my mistake? Can't use it. It's in my Goodwill bag.,"I love the music which is why I bought it. I thought I was purchasing a CD, which it wasn't, which clearly could have been my error. It is a cassette and I do not have anything that will play a cassette. It is now in my Goodwill bag. I will be more careful in the future. My error? Maybe."
5,"Fine, meditative piano","This is my first Brickman CD after hearing Angel Eyes on the radio. What a pleasant surprise! This is fine, meditative piano music to play while reading a good book and sipping a cup of tea. The final vocal track is like a song in an Ally McBeal episode."
4,Excellent!,"This CD is wonderful from beginning to end. It is slow and easy, but not somber, just peaceful. The CD is almost all instrumental, with the last song being the only track with vocals. Some of the tracks have light accompaniment, but the CD really focuses on his piano only.Enjoy!"
3,Warning,"If you are a person looking for a relatively easy German book to read, you might want to know that the book is in Old English print. If the reader is not used to the print, especially in German, it is a big headache to read. If you can get past the print, it is a good book. It's not very useful, however, if you are trying to learn German."
1,Alice auf deutsch,Please be warned that this book is written in the old fashioned German script font and was very hard to read. It actually gave me such a head ache that I couldn't pick the book back up and never finished it.
1,what a pity!,what a pity. i cannot judge the translation but orthography is a complete desaster. and please never try to listen to it! a very strong american accent trying to read a german text full of mistakes. it was hard for me - as a german - to figure out the different words.
4,Doch...,"It would not have been so difficult had it been in an old English typeface. Unfortunately, it was in an old German typeface: something similar to Schwaben Alt perhaps. If you can find a sample typeface on the www, good, otherwise you will have to reverse-engineer it from familiar words and pencil in your notes. It was an unexpected additional challenge, but a welcome one."
4,adaptable hitch extender,This product is adequate. It is reasonably priced. I got what I paid for. The fit and welds are not super quality but it will adapt from 1 1/4 to 2 inches. The fit is O.K. but not not great.
1,Poor manufacturing,"This hitch extender ought to do what it is designed to do. It's metal; it's heavy; it's like every other hitch extender on the market.So what warrants the one star review? I'm sad to say the other one star reviews are correct. This product is manufactured in a sloppy way. In my case, there were metal burrs on the inside of one of the holes in the extender, meaning I couldn't fit the hitch pin through the hole.I toyed with the idea of returning the item to Amazon, but decided it would be too much of a hassle. I found a friend with the tools necessary to grind away the metal burrs, and the hitch pin now fits in the hole.But I would recommend avoiding the hassle and buying another brand of hitch extender. As a buyer, you shouldn't have to complete the manufacturing process after purchase. Avoid buying the Curt Manufacturing brand."
5,Right Tool for the Job,"I got this so I could mount a bike rack to my car. The rack is set up for a 2"" hitch but I could only get a 1-1/4 for my car so this was the ticket. The rack hold 2 bikes for me when I it and the load is not very heavy. Less than 100lbs. I've used it a couple times and it works just fine. I also got a plug for it that keeps dirt out of the adapter when it's not in use."
5,Works Great,"I purchased this adaptor so I could attach my bike rack to my 5th wheeler which had the 1-1/4"" receiver. The adaptor worked well for my purposes."
2,Good Quality but Did NOT Fit,"This is a very good quality adapter, but it did not fit within the 1 1/4 inch factory installed hitch receiver on my Mazda CX-9. Like some other buyers have mentioned, it was ever so slightly too large to slide within the receiver, and it almost got stuck. I did not want to take the time to grind it down, because I thought that removing the paint would just cause me rust problems down the road. As usual, returning it was a snap...that's why I buy so much on Amazon.com."
3,An Ok adapter,The adapter is OK--needed a little work to fit my receiver hitch and the products that slide into it. Minor fixes--should be ready to go from the factory though.
2,Did not fit.,"I should have read the reviews. Pin hole did not align due to weld, was about 1/8-1/4 of an inch off. I was also disappointed there was no mention that this adapter was not meant for towing until you open the package. It'll probably be ok for small boat, which was my purpose of buying, or jet ski or other light towing, but not worth the chance."
3,But... its not?,"This unit is the tried standard of the industry..however, a label affixed to it (in fine print) states..""Not for towing"" This must be an insurance ""not liable"" ploy....Is this what our society has come to?...."
2,"Item seemed appropriate for towing, not noted a non-towing device in description","I unfortunately bought this item before I was ready to start towing my boat. It is a huge disappointment that a company that builds and sells towing hitches would sell an adapter that is marked ""... not for towing ...""Why in the world would anyone spend this kind of money for an adapter other than for towing purposes? A lesser-expensive unit that fit tightly in the 1.25"" receiver would be helpful for bike hitches, but not for towing. Updating the product description to note this fact would serve the seller and manufacturer well.Cerri shares, ""Safe weather and smooth seas to those in search for the right product - keep a wary eye open as you navigate the seas of good and bad products. There are many gems to be found on Amazon.com(tm), but like any store, there are always items that are far from perfect. 2013 KL Lewis"""
3,Think a little more.,"This product fits and functions as advertised. The problem people are having is that their on-vehicle trailer hitch receivers are from a bunch of different manufacturers and most 2"" shanks are long enough that the relationship between the hitch pin hole and the face of the receiver tube is not an issue with a standard 2"" ball mount. This adapter needs to be made to fit close to the receiver to retain the most strength and the result is that sometimes the shaft is too short to allow the pin to be inserted. Another solution, rather than re-drill the pin hole, is to grind the on-vehicle receiver down to allow it to fit. This should not affect the strength of your receiver hitch."
4,A little loose. But probably as good as they get.,It does what it is supposed to but fits a little loose allowing my cargo carrier to sag a little more then it would without requiring an adapter. I'm using it with a Valley Class II Hitch and a Valley Cargo Carrier on a 2007 Dodge Caliber SXT. It is probably as good as they come though...
2,Weld is too big,"When I tried to insert the adapter into my receiver it would not allow the holes to line up, I realized it was because of the size of the weld. I had to take it to a machine shop and drill the holes bigger so it would allow the pin to go through, I am not happy about this."
4,Good Collection for Dementoids & Dementites,"If you're a long-time Dr. D listener, you've probably heard most of these songs on his show. As with most compilations, the reason to buy this as opposed to one of the Dr. Demento albums is the particular combo of songs. I think Oglio did a pretty good job with the selection."
1,Rodeo Song original,"I think the artist--Gary Lee, is the original artist of the Rodeo Songs, although there is a version that was recorded by a local Pittsburgh band (which I think is Gary Lee) that I have on a 45. I am always looking for the CD versions for the sound quality. I purchased another novelty collection CD witht he Gary Lee version on it. Don't know what it sounds like yet..."
1,not happy,"i am trying to find the song ""the rodeo song"" for my husband i was giventhree choices and not sure who sings it cant ask him because i want it as a christmas gift there is no samples to hear which one is the right one what do i do"
2,No idea what this is about,"A great jazz soundtrack underscores this forlorn romance which seems to be something about two brothers and their dramas with their women, plus a sadsack father and his ex-wife. Plot? You got me. The point? Couldn't say. Contemporary Paris doesn't look so hot here."
1,CORDS THAT CANNOT BE BROKEN by Judith Merville,"This book is not bad as a first attempt with a small (now defunct)publisher that did not employ editors, but now the author is happy to announce the forthcoming publication by Llewellyn of a new, vastly improved and updated, version to be published in August under her own name of ANN MERIVALE, with the title SOULS UNITED - THE POWER OF DIVINE CONNECTION. It is already possible to order the book on the Amazon web site. Since writing the first book, Ann Judith Merivale has trained as a regression therapist and in DMP (Deep Memory Process) with the eminent Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Roger Woolger, and she would hate anyone to pay a high price for the now outdated CORDS THAT CANNOT BE BROKEN."
3,Hard to navigate,The book needs an extensive index with all the codes listed. Indices are way too limited. It's almost impossible to find the code you're looking for in the book.
1,book price,the prices of these books are fair to just crazy. goto abebooks.com and you will find the fair market value for most books. the 1871 edition should sell for around 3-4 hundred dollars. bcs it was signed by a few masons means nothing. it was just the guys reunion class. this book was given to a new scottish rite member. the book given to newbies has changed.
5,Review of Remington MS3-3700 Shaver,I've used electric shavers for over 50 years on a very tough beard.This shaver is first rate and ranks with the older Mod. XLR which Iused for many years.
3,Love the Shave - Could do better with durability,"I've been using Remington shavers for over 14 years now. I love using them however, many of the same common problems occur & I end up buying a new one every year. Shave is a great smooth shave - the MS3-3700 has a great beard trimmer which I use in conjunction with the shave. Two main problems - 1) even if you condition the battery - the life of the battery does not last long 2)even with regular cleaning this issue always seems to happen to me - the trimmer will not retract down & you are forced to shave with the trimmer up - very very annoying & happens to all of the Remington MS3's that I've had (quite a bit). Its not really worth the effort to send it to Remington - they usually charge you - you have to pay shipping & the entire time it is in repair you DON'T HAVE A SHAVER!"
3,Poor Battery Life,"Shaves excellent. Quiet. Very poor battery life. Only able to get 3 shaves before recharging, NOT 60 minutes as the package states. I returned the shaver to customer service. They replaced it promptly. The replacement also shaves only 3 days before needing to be recharged!"
5,The Glimmers!,"Raw, funky and hypnotic, this mix by the Glimmers features a healthy dose of the venerated genre of italo-disco (in the form of tracks by Lindstrom & Prins Thomas, and remixes by Idjut Boys and Magnetophone), as well as out-and-out house. One of my favorite moments on this mix is when the Out Hud remix of ""Kel's Vintage Thought"" stops, and the dirty bass of Chicago's ""I'm A Man"" appears, to ride out its hypnotic groove for almost 8 minutes. If your heart can keep up to the steady pulse and manic pace of this album, you are indeed made of stern stuff."
3,On par with the directions that come with an assemble-yourself desk from Wal-Mart.,"The only books that I can find that give you 'live' experience with Photoshop are Adobe's Classroom In a Book (CIB) series and the Digital Classroom series. The Digital Classroom series (even though not through Adobe) is just a redo of the CIB series with fewer editing errors and better pedagogy. The audience for the CIB series is questionable. An absolute beginner has no business with this series, and a low-intermediate will get something out of it, but with a price of unnecessary frustration. It reminds me of most technology and engineering. Most products are decent, but the tutorials/documentations is usually quite sub-par."
5,good plates,"I ordered these to replace a broken plate that came with a set I received as a wedding present. The plates look great, and they can go in the microwave or the dishwasher. The only thing that I don't like about them is the raised lip of the plate is flat instead of being angled in towards the center of the plate. The plates are very durable, and nice and heavy so they stay put while you're using them."
3,Great when it works,I have the 1/2 drive and 3/8 drive Gearwrench torque wrenches. Easy to set desired torque value. It beeps when you approach the set point so you don't have to watch the display. Battery life is acceptable but not great. Keep some spare AAA in your tool box. Both wrenches quit working within 9 months of purchase and they were repaired under warranty. The 1/2 drive unit has failed again and the 3/8 drive wrench acts odd at times. Bottom line is that I don't have a lot of confidence in these tools. Tools received light use in a home garage.
2,Cheesy,Definately got what I paid for - not much. Parts are loose and cheesy. Spend a little more and get something that will last. I wish I had.
4,printer,"So far I am pleased with this product. It arrived undamaged and much faster than I had anticipated. For an inkjet printer the quality is really good, though somewhat slow. It is easy to use and install. I have had some trouble with printing as the paper in the tray was not feeding properly. After working with it for a while I finally got it to work. I have not used it to print photos yet, but so far I am pleased."
3,Canon PIXMA IP6310D,"for a photo printer, this isn't the greatest printer. I can't tell the differance in the pictures my epson C84 printed to what this one prints. however this printer is much faster. another thing, it only has 2 ink cartrages. if you are looking for a good photo printer get one that has 4 or more cartrages.all in all it is a good printer, but I don't think its worth the price."
4,fine photo printer for non-professionals,"I've had my iP6310D for four months now and I am perfectly happy with it. I am not a professional photographer and use a point-and-shoot camera. The printer does a nice job of printing these types of pictures. I would suggest using the Canon 52 photo ink cartridge for high quantity printing. I would estimate that I've been able to print approximately 30-40 photos (4x6 size), I don't know if that's a lot or just a little.Easy to use, quick to set up.Someone complained about the noise and slow speed of the printer. Really, these are very small issues for the price. This item can be bought as a refurbished printer, which I've seen for 50% less than the list price for a new one. If you can get this kind of deal, then this printer is really a good buy."
1,AWFUL!,"This product has been a pain in the a**. The cartridges don't last, the color cartridges have lasted for about 1 picture and it will print with 1/2 color and 1/2 black and white. I've also had problems with the Canon scanner. I just bought an HP and it has been a dream compared to this."
2,Unfortunate purchase,"The machine is larger than I expected, but I could work around that. However, I can't ignore the loud operation. In addition, the ice in the ice baskets does not stay frozen, and they melt into the water reservoir, forcing the level of ice to never stay caught up... which means the machines runs way more than it should. And, the ice is never fully solid due to the machine not staying cold enough. I will be returning the unit.I originally rated the product as a 1 - however I've revised it to a 2 because of the company's excellent return policy and speedy refund. They sent me a fedex slip, I used the original packing, scheduled a fedex pickup and was done with it."
2,We sent this back,"We bought this in hopes of having enough ice when we have guests over. Our fridge just can't keep up in the summer. It was nice looking but didn't make ice in the specified time (per the manual). It was taking significantly longer and we attempted to adjust settings, inspected the unit etc and didn't see anything wrong. We ended up sending it back."
1,"Initially nice, but now broken?","We have this behind our bar, it was really a nice addition and worked quite well until someone left it full of water and the filter clogged (I think). The instructions say to try cleaning the filter which makes sense, but then it has an arrow pointing generally to the machine and that's about it for details on how to do this task. And there is really no way to get into it. It's pretty ridiculous - probably an easy solution IF you could only get into the machine. But since you cannot, the ice maker is now totally useless to us."
4,ice,Ready to go out of the boxIce galore and want no more. Medium cubes are great for grandkids. Easy to cleanLove itIts cool
4,"Great Product, Great Company","I bought this machine in December of 2007. The first machine didn't work right, but I didn't realize it because I'd never had an ice-maker before. However, after about six weeks, I realized that it was producing fewer and fewer pieces of ice per cycle.The return period had expired, but even so, NewAir sent me a replacement unit AND paid for the shipping to return the old one! Now, that's standing behind your product!The replacement machine worked fine, and is still diligently pumping out ice. It has paid for itself many times over. Before I got it, I was buying ice at the store, two or three bags a week at $2.00 a bag.My only complaint about the machine is that it is VERY difficult to clean. The top does not come off so that you can clean the upper chamber and water tray easily-- in fact, cleaning the upper chamber and water tray is damn near impossible.Even so, it's a great little machine, well worth the money."
1,not what you think,ya know got it in may died in sep what can i say bad quality no durability just like most crap you buy these days oh and can only get partial refund of maybe 2 bucks and i pay for shipping so to the dump it go's.
2,Good...until 2 months,"At first this was the best $200.00 I'd even spent for fathers day. As a family that goes camping and is constantly on the go this machine made it simple to bag ice at home or plug into our motor home at a campground. that was until 2 weeks ago. It started making smaller ice cubes even on the biggest setting, running a ton but hardly any ice production and saying the ice chest was full..with 3 ice cubes in it. I did the whole unplug it let it ""de-ice"" itself plug it back in and it'll be good. It has helped some but not enough. We have friends we camp with that have to same thing and theirs works great, not sure if we just got the dud of the group of what as all of us ordered them at the same time for fathers day. Have contacted the customer support in hopes they will send a new one as it is only 2 months old."
1,Did not meet any expectations,"Made ice for about a week and then it started to make smaller and smaller cubes and they never really froze. When it stopped completely after two weeks the owners manual said to send it to a ""qualified technician"" No numbers to call not even for the New Air Company. I sent it back immediately."
5,Ice Pleaser,"Having never seen a portable ice maker, I didn't know what to expect but was happily surprised. It works like a charm--is fast and produces lots of ice. We have found that when the ice maker is full, it stops producing so we pour the ice cubes in the container in the freezer and then it continues to product ice. Our entire family is pleased with it and it small enough to carry on vacations."
1,NICE LOOKING - BUT NO ICE,Internal components are plastic. Ice maker worked great for about a month and the ice lifting mechanism is plastic and broke. Amazon will only refund 50% of the purchase price and I have to pay shipping. If you are looking for an Ice Maker pass on this one as it's internal components will break. Too bad - really liked the looks of the unit...
2,"Slow, melts ice","Is not a fast ice maker, after it makes the ice, the cubes arent even fully frozen, not to mention the machine it self does not keep the ice melted once it is made. So if you aren't paying attention at all times to the machine, it's useless."
2,"Great, but...","The product worked great at making ice for over a year. Then a little plastic piece broke on the tray that slides the ice into the bin. Due to this poor design, I have a large paperweight (it can no longer make ice). Unfortunately, this small plastic piece cannot be replaced (poor design). I glued it back several times, but it kept breaking and the small piece (about 1/2 inch long and the diameter of a toothpick) is now gone."
1,Stopped working suddenly,"I was absolutely thrilled with this product until this week. It has now been approximately nine months since I purchased it and suddenly it just died. The device itself says that it is making ice but no ice is actually being made. I read the online manual that comes with the device and it says if the ice-making cycle is normal but ice is not being made the device is essentially broken but to ""verify with a qualified technician."" Spending $200 on a 'qualified technician' to verify that my $200 product does not work does not strike me as the best use of my money so I don't think I'll be taking that route. I did contact the company so I'm crossing my fingers that they actually do something to fix this (apparently a manufacturer's warranty up to 1 year is included with the product) but we'll see."
3,Too Loud and Ice Melts,"We purchased this because the ice maker on our refrigerator/freezer is no longer working (and after 3 attempts we've decided not to fix it until we get a new refrig/freezer).This ice maker does what it says - it makes ice. However, the temperature seems to be below freezing, so the ice is constantly melting into the water chamber which then requires the maker to almost continuously make more ice. Not only does that waste some energy, but the maker is somewhat noisy and we don't like having it in our kitchen. In addition, we like to take the ice and put it in our freezer - but because it is always melting, it then sticks together in our freezer.If you don't mind the noise (or you have a place you can put this thing that is isolated from the rest of your home), then you'll probably think this is good for your needs."
5,New Air ice maker,"Love this appliance for the RV. Doesn't waste water, and ice is always available. Makes plenty to use for drinks and to keep the ice chest really cold. Plug it in outside the RV in the shade. The only sound is the ice cubes falling into the bin. Wish I had it long ago. Well worth the $$. Will ultimately pay for itself in ice we don't have to buy."
3,Take your chances,"I had to return the first one, it only produced about 1/4 of the advertised output. I knew it wasnt working right, and based on other reviews figured I had a lemon. I returned it and the second one functioned pretty much as advertised. It makes about 8 pieces of ice every 10-15minutes.As stated in other reviews, it does not keep the ice it makes frozen, so you constanty are moving it to your freezer. And since the early ice is melting, you leave a stream of water from the icemaker to your freezer. Then when you dump it in your freezer, the partially melted ice bonds and freezes to your existing ice, and you end up with large clumps of frozen cubes. Not something I wanted to deal with, so I returned the second one as well."
2,Works... for awhile,I've had two of these. One lasted for about 6 months before the roller pin that turns under the ice maker broke and the only moving part stopped working. I thought it was odd so I got another. This one lasted 1 month and then only 1/2 of the ice making silver probes would get cold enough to make ice. Now the thing won't make ice at all because only about 1/4 of the thing gets cold at all. When they work they are great... that's the rub. They don't work very long when they work.
3,Countertop ice maker good for cooling drinks,"Received our icecube maker, purchased at Amazon promptly. directions for use were good. Took it camping over Labor Day and it worked great for small quantities of ice.But, if the ice cubes are left to melt and refreeze, they will get an off taste.We found that the small size cubes would squeeze into a wattle bottle, but the medium were better for putting in glasses. Could not, however, make enough ice to fill ourdaughter's cooler as it melted too fast. Learned to shut it off at night so we didn't have to hear the ice plunk into the ice bucket. Nice little unit."
4,good ice maker,this is a good ice maker. it is sturdy and actually produces ice quickly.very handy for my apartment. my frig has no ice maker.
2,It lasted 3 months and then broke down but they replaced it however the new one only lasted 3 months and they made me pay return,"It lasted 3 months and then broke down. It does nothing but say add water when the water is full. The company has offered a better model and paid for shipping. Assuming this one works we will be very happy. Well surprise surprise, the upgrade cost me $50 and it broke down after a few months also. They made ME pay the return postage so they can and try to fix the piece of Chinese junk!"
1,BEWARE,This ice maker worked great for 13 months and then died. It came with a 12 month warranty. Too bad. BEWARE!!!
4,Nice Ice Maker,"August 2009 was when I received my NewAir AI-100S Portable Ice Maker. November 2010 is when it died. A bag of ice (in my area) cost $2.09 plus going to the store (gas),(""No Ice Today""), waiting in line, do the math were buying another one just as soon as we can."
1,Don't order if you live overseas,"First, I would just like to say that I bought this particular item because of the positive reviews. That said, I still can't tell you how well it makes ice due to both units that were sent to me don't work. Maybe it was the military postal service's shotty handling, I don't know. Fact is, I am very disapointed. I guess I'll just have to drink warm whiskey. Second, Air and Water's customer service people are very nice, I don't mean to portray any hostility toward them. That does not make up for a below average, chinese manufactured p.o.s.Update:I was able to take the second unit apart and repair the electrical malfunctions, it now works great. If you are a whiskey drinker, drink fast. The ice isn't clear, so it melts faster than normal. Other than that, I love this thing. (I have no problem drinking fast);}"
1,Only worked 4 X's,"This ice maker worked very well, but only four times, then the pump went up. I had to send it back. Its a good thing I used it all those times before the 30 day deadline because I would have been stuck with it."
3,"the icmaker works,there was a little plastic taste for a few days ,,but better cleaning or mabe airing it out first probably wou","it was hard to unpacck but cutting the box made it simple.it does make ice quickly,but a bigger ice bin would have been nice"
5,Portable ice maker,"We love this product. No installation, and it can be easily moved from room-to-room. We fill it with our own spring water for ice cubes with no unwanted taste from other foods in a refrigerator. We also find it easier to get ice from than built-in refrigerator ice makers."
4,"Not what I expected, but happy with the unit.","I didnt have any taste issues but I ran several batches of ice through it before I tried the ice. Its not as fast as I'd hoped and the ice cubes are pretty small, the mechanism that moves the ice is fairly noisy. I wouldnt want to try to sleep through that noise.But it does what you'd expect, it makes ice and you can take it with you camping and no longer have to return to civilization to purchase more ice."
5,"Little Book, Big Impact","Lots of histories cover the major events of WWII, but what I liked was the way the author covered small details--little ""slices of life"" aboard a fighting ship.It's difficult for readers today, accustomed to the security we enjoy, to appreciate the anxiety that sailors faced. What to us seems like an inevitable victory against Japan was not such a sure thing to the men being shot at, and for that reason alone this book is worth reading."
2,Doesn't Cut,It's sleek and looks very nice but the box smells like melted plastic and it DOESN'T cut! If you have thick hair... look elsewhere.
4,Good Product,PositivesThe product seems to be good. Almost everything works fine. Good investment for the price paid. Lots of extra accessories provided.NegativeOnly the neckline trimmer seems to have problem. The problem is with the circuit. It seems to be loose and not complete. I put a penny(coin) at the end of the cap and closed it. Its a bit hard to close but closes without breaking the cap. It works perfect after the alteration.Other than the problem described everything is perfect.
4,worth every penny,I have had my share of trimmers and this one works the best and the easiest to clean.
5,So far so good,It seems to be much better built than the several Oster clippers I've owned and the fact that it is cordless is a real plus.
2,"Keep looking, this clipper is not worth it.","Pros:... always oiled blades, so you never have to grease them ... very nice cutting for the first couple of haircuts ... can be cordless I guess ... good price ....Cons:... after the first couple of cuts, when finished cutting hair there are ALWAYS some that don't get cut - blades don't seem sharp enough to cut all my hair ... I have thick hair, so it gets jammed up sometimes on my head and hurts like a SOB ... cordless option is useless, as there is not enough power to cut anything ... takes a long time to recharge the batteries, not that it matters since for any haircut, it's better to plug it in ... only a 30 day money back guarantee, so by the time you realize its a piece of junk, its already too late ..."
1,Not what I expected!,When used with anything but the one inch attachment it badly pulls hair. Even the scissors and trimmer are dull.
2,Not the best.,"Despite the great price, the Remington hair cutter doesn't actually cut hair. The first time we used it, it was fabulous. But now, it pulls the hair rather than cutting it."
4,Remington HC-920,"I was very impressed with the cutting power of the HC-920, I have very thick hair that normally jams up clippers unless I constantly stop to take my hair out. Not the case with the HC-920.My only qualm is the very short battery life. If I do not charge it before each use -I use it once every two weeks-. It will go dead by the middle of my haircut."
2,You'll Get What You Pay For,"[...] Don't get me wrong, the box is nice and the items included are very cool...but after two or three uses, mine didn't even cut anymore. I ended up throwing it away.Stay away from this one."
2,AFTER 1 YEAR...PROS AND CONS!,"WE HAVE BEEN USING THIS CLIPPER FOR MY SONS AND MY HAIRCUTS FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR. THE TITANIUM BLADES ARE IN NEED OF SHARPENING WHICH WILL PROBABLY COST MORE THAN THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CLIPPER. WITHIN ABOUT 3 MONTHS TWO OF THE HAIR GUIDES RECEIVED BROKEN TEETH DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY MUST BE CRAMMED INTO THE STORAGE BOX BEFORE SHUTTING IT. ONE OF THE GUIDES WAS OUR MAIN USE GUIDE. I TRIED CONTACTING REMINGTON AND A FEW PARTS DEALERS. REMINGTON NEVER RESPONDED, THE PARTS DEALERS TOLD ME THEY ARE NOT REPLACEABLE. SO WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO GIVE HAIRCUTS USING THE OTHER GUIDES SINCE THEN. BASCIALLY I LIKE THE CLIPPER. IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO USE. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT FROM REMINGTON I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. WE WILL BE REPLACING THIS, NOW ALMOST USELESS, CLIPPER SOON. REMINGTON WILL NOT GET OUR REPEAT BUSINESS!"
4,Good product for the price,"I've used this thing twice so far. I didn't experience any trouble with it ""snagging"" and not cutting hair. The battery is kinda short - it died out after about 15-20 minutes of use the first time I used it. No problems the second time (maybe I just got faster?) I'm a young male and just slap a guard on this thing and buzz my hair down - really glad I invested in this instead of paying some goon to do it for me. The device is comfortable in your hand. It's easy to clean. The clippers are pre-oiled for life according to the user guide. The guard selection is comes with is very good. All in all I would recommend this for a home hair cutting solution - solid product, good price."
2,Adaptor and battery stopped working in two days,Overall it's a good product. But one bad thing spoils whole fun -It's adaptor stopped working after 2 days. Battery didn't last too long.Otherwise blades/combs/quality of material is more than expected.worth a try if you have separate adaptor to wrk with.
3,Decent Hair cut kit,I am using this hair cut kit for the past 1 year without any issues. I highky recommend this product.
2,not very good on thick hair,"It worked relatively well on my 20 month son's soft hair, but it was terrible on my mom's thick hair, which was the 4th hair cut I made with the Remington. We had to go over and over the same spots, and I had to hold her short hair with my other hand to be able to trim it. I also had to clean it at least 5 times until I finished her haircut. The other trimmer we had worked for almost 7 years. I gave 2 stars because it's quiet and it looks nice."
1,DON'T BUY!!!,I recently purchased this item expecting it to be a great product because of the remington name... Boy was I surprised... After charging the trimmer for 20 hours (Suggested is 14) the battery only lasted for 20 minutes!!! I was still cutting my hair when the thing died... If I wanted to have it plugged in to cut my hair I would not have bought a cordless trimmer... So unless you can cut hair at warp speed I would suggest looking elsewhere for a set of clippers.
1,More Cheap Junk From China,"The attachments have this tiny, thin, plastic tab that is suppose to hold them on to the cutter. Try putting on an attachment a couple of times, and they all break off, rendering the attachment (and the entire kit) useless. Save your money and avoid like the plague."
1,Waste of Money,"Do NOT waste your money on the Remington HC-920! I've had mine for a little over a year and started having problems after only about 15 haircuts. First, the battery stopped holding a decent charge long enough to cut hair for more than 5 minutes and got progressively worse as time went on. Then it only worked when I plugged it in because the supposedly rechargeable battery was shot. Now it only works intermittently, oscillating between a high-pitched ""buzzing"" sound and a low-speed/low-pitched ""whirring"" sound, even when it's plugged in! Somehow the defective battery is affecting the electric motor of these clippers so that it no longer effectively cuts hair in either mode (plugged-in or unplugged). PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BRAND OR THIS MODEL OF CLIPPERS. I'm sticking with Wahl or Oster from now on."
1,Buyer beware - Product lasted only 40 days!,"I bought this product for the same reason as others - light, cordless, positive reviews and Remingtons reputation. I used it 8 to 10 times before it stopped working. In all fairness I was initially pleased with the cutter the breif time it worked.The unit will not recharge and the only solution according to Remington's parent company is that I ship it to them at my expense. There's no guarantee that the repaired unit will work or a new unit will work. The risk and expense is all assumed by the customer. Clearly the manufacturer does not believe in their own product or express any desire to develop a reputation or goodwill with a customer.My previous cutter from Wahl lasted 10 years and is still working. I just liked the idea of upgrading to a modern cordless unit. I'm still hoping Remington will reconsider but at this point it looks like Remington just lost another customer. [...]"
4,good price for good item,"it s realy good clipper and the free small clipper helps alot with the edges . just sometimes it can be sharp enough to cut your skin that happen twice for me . i dont know is this my fault or the machine i m just a beginner.MY advice ""buy it ""it s worthy for every penny."
3,Good,I bought and brought it to Iraq with me. I used is for about 8 mouths before it burnt up. The only down fall i have with it was the cheap guards that always popped off.
1,Won't last long,"Don't buy this clipper.As many pointed out, it will stop cutting after a couple of occasions.I used it mainly to trim by beard, every two weeks on average, plus cut my hair maximum ten times, all this over a period of 2 years - and it simply does not cut anymore.Just don't buy it, it's not worth any money since it will be money thrown away pretty soon."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD THE PRICE IS REALLY GOOD....BUT IT WONT WORK AT ALL!!!!!!I COULD NOT EVEN USE IT ONCE A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!! IF I WOULD HAVE LEFT FEEDBACK JUST ON LOOKS I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS BUT LOOKS DONT CUT HAIR.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"I bought this product for my boyfriend who has been shaving his head for eight years. He likes the buzz-cut look, so he shaves using no attachments. This product wouldn't even cut his hair the first time he tried to use it where as his old Conair one was still going strong. To make matters worse, it cost me almost ten dollars to ship it back to Amazon because it's so heavy. A Christmas gift disappointment and overall pain in the..."
5,Beyond expectations and no hair pulling.,"I bought this because I can't go to the barber while recovering from a bone marrow transplant. For the price, I considered it would do as an interim step, but had no great expectations. I'll probably never go to the barber again. It is a high quality product and performs well beyond what I expected. I anticipated some hair pulling, but there is none. It has good sharp blades and high cutting speed. This is with or without using the power cord. My daughter in law cuts my hair outdoors and likes it so much she is using it on my son's hair. He likes it as much as I do. I highly recommend this product."
3,fairly good,"I used these clippers a lot for simple crew cuts, and the clippers were fairly good.However, in retrospectthe internal battery was not useful, because i always used the clippers with the electric cord, and in factthe internal battery was significantly counter-productive, because there were times when the clippers would not function sufficiently to cut hair, even with the electric cord attached, because the battery was not sufficiently charged.Also, the motor seemed not as powerful as that of the Wahl Color Pro clippers."
3,"Practical, but a little too many HR/Legal warnings for me","This book is brief and practical. I would call it Behavioral Interviewing 101 ... or maybe better ... for K-5th grade. It's a little too basic and it comes from the perspective that the reader knows nothing about interviewing, including some very basic legal snafus."
3,correct voices,"I have heard the singing voice used by Louise Brooks in Prix de Beaute. Not only is it not Edith Piaf,singing in the film dubbed for Louise Brooks. Edith Piaf was not singing professionally in 1930,nor was she recording in 1930. Since when is Louise Brooks a soprano?"
3,IT IS OK.,I REALLY LIKE MY PURCHASE. I PURCHASED THE DORA PRODUCT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. I WILL RATE THE PRODUCT AGAIN AFTER SHE RECEIVES AND USES IT.
3,great but expensive,"I was shocked how well stickers motivated my daughter to use the potty. However, I had similar results with ""regular"" cheap stickers. To be fair though, my daughter ""likes"" Dora, but is not really completey crazy over her...if she was more of a Dora freak I might be giving it 5 stars."
4,Very cute,We haven't had a chance to use these yet- But they are very cute. A little bit smaller than I hoped for but it comes with lots of cute reward stickers.
3,Fun stickers,Helped to a degree. Not a great quality. Fast become obsolete and not interesting for the baby. I wouldn't buy again.
4,Good Tool,"My daughter was really into Dora when we started potty training so when she started to resist the potty we decided to order this andDora's Potty Book (Dora the Explorer). I really like that this chart breaks down all the steps in going potty so I could reward my daughter for accomplishing even one step. After she filled one area quickly we just focused on actually gong in the potty and flushing. It would be nice if the chart had more spaces, but I just doubled stickers or added some little stickers form the dollar store."
3,Value is what YOU think it is,"For the price and size, I got the value I anticipated. However, some men may require a much stronger cord for leg workouts which I haven't been able to find; perhaps they're not made and will need a spring instead. Otherwise, I got what I paid for."
4,Great Collection,"I thought this was an excellent compilation. So many good tunes from some of the more obscure bands. At least obscure in that you don't find them on EVERY 80's comp, like many others. Joe Jackson ""Breaking Us In Two"" and ""Life's What You Make It"" by Talk Talk are two shining stars."
3,Works fine,Does what it says it does. Used it to winterize the boat this spring. Volvo penta out drive on a four winns boat.
1,Disappointing performance,I was looking for a replacement for my old Norelco razor (battery getting weak after 4 years) and thought that I would give Remington a try. I was very disapointed with the performance of this razor. It did not cut as well as my old Norelco and the cutting heads seemed to heat up from friction very quickly. I returned this razor and am purchasing another Norelco.
1,OUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I tried Remington razors (including the R-950) and they all left very irritating red marks on my neck. I did not push hard, and kept trying for 3 weeks. I am used to using electric razors and never had this issue. My skin is not that sensitive. I was on travel to Japan (live in Texas) and it was embarrasing to say the least, looking like that in meetings.I went back to the Norelco and the shave is just as close and no irritation at all. Perhaps it's due to their movable heads that move with the curvature of your face. (they say it's patented, not sure). Please learn from my mistake."
1,Not a good choice,"Both this shaver two weeks ago. Worked ok but was very irritating on my neck. Never had that problem with my Norelcos. The problem was it stopped working a week after buying it for no reason. Would not turn on, recharged it no change. Took the blades off and motor worked, cleaned heads and no difference. Finally disasembled heads again looked closely and could see no reason for problem. Tossed shaver since I trashed the box and reciept. I have two words ""Buy Norelco""."
3,"Does the job, but I have some issues","Why would you think of making a shaver without a flip top? This shaver annoyingly required the owner to stick his fingernails into the minimal ridging underneath the heads of the shaver and physically remove the head of the shaver in order to empty it. You get the shavings all over your hands. How ridiculous! This earns it a two point reduction because of annoyance.Otherwise, after 2 weeks, the transition to this shaver (which included some cuts and redness) has died down, and it is working well."
2,TOO Sharp,"This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me. I used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor. Ouch. However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor. The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave."
1,Cheap plastic.,"Worked alright for a few months. I wasn't especially pleased with the shave quality i.e. skin irritation, hair pulls. I figured that this would go away as I was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads. It didn't.The bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair wasn't easy and resulted in breakage, no doubt due to the cheap plastic used. Never again."
4,close shave,"I bought this for my husband as a gift, he really likes how close it shaves, but says it definately takes a couple of weeks for your skin to get used to it as it is REALLY sharp!"
2,Trimmer failed almost immediately,"The main shaving part of this product is fine, but the pop up trimmer broke within a couple months of buying it with only light use. Since I obviously need this, this product went in the trash after hardly having been used."
4,Good economical shaver,"I've used this razor for about two years and I'm pleased overall. It gives a pretty close shave. For comparison, I've used Braun razors before this for many years. For the money, this is a good razor. Other reviewers mention that it is hard to clean the cutters; true. But popping off the head for just a daily 'emptying' is not problematic. I would say it's one of the best 'value' razors. Four stars for that category.Edit:I failed to mention: the battery lasts for 3-4 shaves; fully charges in about 2-3 hrs. The replacement heads can be pricey; from $23 - $30.I reiterate, good shaver if bought for around $35. It is only lacking if compared to high-end shavers."
3,Fragile razor,"I used this razor for 2-3 years--I have no complaints about the shaves I got, but the unit itself is fragile and various parts broke apart over time. I finally got tired of paying 50 percent of the cost of a new razor for the head assembly and tossed it in the trash."
2,used it twice and then started pulling hair,"I was happy when i used it the first and second time but the third time i was disappointed, because it started pulling hair instaid of cutting it."
3,razor,I never did get the R-950. Amazon sent the XL600. I sent it back and asked them not to substitute. They did anyway and sent the XL600 to me a second time. I kept it because I needed a razor and did not want to fool with sending it back again. It does not shave as close as my old R-950 but it works ok. I will use it while trying to find somethine that works as well as my old R-950.
3,Not bad,"This is a very good family film. I really liked the plot and how the main character grew with each new problem,even though some parts were a little to much for my age."
3,Recollections from a bus driver's perspective,"This book is a most interesting history of our bus industry from this driver's perspective. He was hired off the streets of L. A. in 1927 to drive a sleeper coach from there to St. Louis. Great tales of the hardships he, other drivers, and their passengers suffered in those early days. Russ writes of the big bands he carried, the weather and the dirt roads, and the military movements of WWII."
3,"Pretty wreath, but not sturdy","This wreath is pretty, but was already falling apart when I received it due to the poor packaging. The little red ""berries"" pop off quite easily. Overall, it works for the holidays on my front door."
5,psychology & faith,I enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and pragmatic. A very down to earth understanding of human beings and their angst.
2,So wrong,"I was looking forward to reading his book but couldn't get past the first few pages. I was shocked to the point of throwing the book in the garbage can when I came to Father Groeschel's statement that (paraphrasing): before we start, we must agree on several things...and the first is that Man is basically good.Has the good father read his Bible at all? What did the Old Testament prophets and poets say? What did Saint Paul say? But most importantly, what did Jesus say?If Man was basically good, then Man would have no need of a Saving Goodness.How wrong can any man be in his thinking!"
1,No Good,"Not a good product, I would rather spend my money on a better condom brand that feels better and performs better."
5,Could not have said it better!,I am impressed by Laurie Windham's insight. This book will be in the Christmas stocking of all my employees.
5,Lost in space,"I just received this CD for Christmas 2011 because I lost my copy from way back in 1995. So happy to be reunited with these songs because they help my mind to get to a peaceful space. When I listen to this CD, I press the ""continuous play"" button and the evening hours just go by......"
5,Wonderful Massage Music,This CD has a great deal to offer those people who love to have soothing music playing. My favorite is the second song on the CD. You will not be disappointed with this musical smorgasbord.
5,Love these!,"I ordered two of these mats to lay end-to-end infront of my tool box. I am a mechanic and own my own repair shop, and these help cut down fatigue when I am standing on the concrete floor. I have had two mats (with a Snap-On tools logo die cut and laminated in the center of the mat) for 10 years, and they just finally started bubbling up in the middle and delaminating around the logo, so I decided it was time to replace them. Snapon gets $375.00 for the EXACT same style mat, 3' x 4' so these are longer by a foot, and so much cheaper. I would expect these to outlast the snap on mats I had since there are no logos to become delaminated."
4,Very good product,"We use these mats at work. It is a production enviorment with concrete floors. Where we have to stand in certain points for elongated periods of time they bought these to use. It does make a noticeable difference standing on them. They aren't heavy to move around, but bulky and hard to keep rolled if you have to store them for a period. However I do enjoy having them and they do make a difference, for the better. I would get them for my garage but I can't afford them now. However when I can, I will definitely get these."
4,"Good , but one of the weaker Gundam titles","Many of the Gunadam series have a very similar plot. What distinguishes them from each other is the character development. Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made."
4,Earthway C22HD worth the money,Seems to be well built and with the adjustable handle bars that is is plus for a taller person. Insturctions are ok but could use some improvement. All in all worth the money
1,Poor fit,"The handle assembly didn't fit. The manufacturer sent replacements, and after shimming and bending, I was able to make everything work correctly. The manufacturer shipped a complete new unit that was only slightly better than the first. After all the work, I'm keeping the first one. About $125.00 over priced."
5,C22HDS the best,After reading many reviews I found the stainless version to be the best choice for me. I see very little that could go wrong with the C22HDS. Amazon is my first choice but I was only able to find this version at one seller found on the web. I'm very pleased with Earthway in making such a solid spreader. Check out your options to see how long you want your spreader to last. C22HDS will last many more years than the C22HD making the price difference no big deal. Both will do the same job but one will outlast the other. I have bought the last spreader I'll ever buy!!!
4,Does the job!,"My husband purchased this item. It works pretty good. It is easier to push since it has the wider wheels. The only thing that didn't work too great was the pin that spins in the hopper to move the seed,fertilizer etc. He had to make a pin that was a little larger . Now it works better. It holds the 50lbs. as stated. It did take awhile to put together. Not the easiest thing to do!"
3,Who is that sexy guy?,"Mackenzie Donahue - His lazy smile denied the secrets in his deep blue eyes..... Experience: Undercover government agent - upholder of justice and rescuer of damsels in distress. Objective: Getting close to Holly Reynolds - to spy on her suspect brother! Yet after pulling Holly to safety and holding her in his arms, the last thing he wanted to do was deceive her. Their sizzling attraction made his cover possible - but his lies hid the truth in his heart all too well......Some pretty hot love scenes - good book overall."
5,Delightful from the start!,"This book gets off to a roaring start and doesn't let up until the finish. It is a charming story of a man (Nicholas) who is intent on denying his growing affections for a feisty, engaging, outspoken young woman (Summer) who won't take no for an answer. Their battle of wits and emotions is both delightful and touching. Do not pass over the poem at the beginning of the book. I am now reading ""Renegade Love"" and although it is good, it does not move as swiftly as ""Dream Fever"". Try to find it since it's out of print."
1,I wish I could give less than 1 star,"Rolando is a great photographer,I'm sure, but this video doesen't show it. In fact, this video doesen't show anything but Rolando enjoying himself talk. If you delete all the war stories he tells in the video there may be some instruction. I think! I'm proposing that the title be changed to ""Conversation made Simple with Rolando Gomez"". I will sell you mine if you want it at a great bargin!"
2,just a boring lecture!,"A Sleeper!Photography instruction is information. Lets convey it in an upbeat way!This was drudgery. Camera on Rolando,and that was it! Another boring lecture! I Expected to see just a little bit more of Rolando with a model, some interaction, a shoot segment, or something that would want to hold you to the tv.I've packed mine up to ship it back to Amazon. This is not what I had expected at all.The supplemental disc, from a shoot, well, that is bogus! Rolando, plese go back and re-make this entire dvd.You have information to get out there, but its gonna put everyone to sleep! Comparing your attempt to those dvd's made by WILL CROCKET, his are outstanding, and lively,a nd demonstrations are well planned and executed. I am totaly disappointed in this dvd set."
1,Save Your Money,"If you want to learn from Rolando save your money and attend one of his live workshops. This DVD set is useless. As others have pointed out, it's just Rolando talking. No examples to illustrate waht he's discussing, no video of setting up lights, etc. The one segment where he actually attempts to illustrate a point with a live model, he ends up standing between the camera and model so you can't see anything. Boring content, bad production make this one a loser."
1,This guy can shoot photos but can't really teach properly..,"Much like everyone else says, Rolando should focus on instructions, and not just having a conversation filmed.If you really need/want a good instructor, go with Kelby's photo training. His DVDs are much much better and actually worth the money. You can skip Rolando's stuff unless you're really into his work, but personally, I think Kelby and the photogs he hires for his tutorials are light-years ahead of Gomez."
3,Fun to see Campbell stretch,"I had heard of this film a while ago. When I finally saw it, I was mildly surprised. I enjoyed the light comic story as well as seeing Bruce Campbell do something different. I recommend this film to fans and non-fans alike."
4,How do You Say Zamboni in French?,"Okay, let's face facts here, if you don't NORMALLY watch French films and you're only renting this because you're a Bruce Campbell fan, you're going to hate THE ICE RINK. Fortunately for me (although I did rent this because of Campbell) I've logged many hours watching all types of foreign films so the fact that his screen time is limited didn't completely ruin film for me. (He does have a great entrance though--they can't get the door of his car open, so they have to drag him out the window which only opens halfway.) This isn't a romantic comedy, it's a film about making a film more of a mocumentary actually, and while it isn't as outrageously hilarious as another French film on the same subject called LET'S MAKE A DIRTY MOVIE, THE ICE RINK still made me laugh out loud several times and that's good enough for me."
5,The often forgotten ingredient to the enchantment,"Yes, very few music fans are actually aware of the role of music producers in the making of timeless (or in more subjective terms, special) recordings. Richard Buskin's opus, which begins with a passionate foreword by Brian Wilson, will help to clarify the work of past and present key figures in the record production world. To the initiated, the testimonies, anecdotes and other episodes that once were only confined to the control room come to life as the living proof of the utmost importance of such professionals in the making of the songs we all love, showing that they often need far more than just ""good ears"". Part diplomats, part businessmen, part psychologists, part marketing experts; record producer helped to shape music as we know it today. As a final comment, unlike Mark Cunningham's book (which is also fantastic, by the way), this one is not only confined to the UK scene."
5,Wonderful Medieval Romance,"I found the conflicts particularly vivid and well-developed in this, my first, Tina St. John romance. Both the hero and heroine's motivations were believable and vividly drawn. The romance grew beautifully and the heat simmered before boiling nicely. The plot was interesting and the story flowed. The setting and dialogue felt authentic to the time without devoting too much space to detail. I'll be adding the rest of this author's books to my TBR list."
5,so sweet!,"I have been reading a lot of historical romances lately, and this one is among my favorites. Griffin, the male lead, has let his circumstances in life turn him into an uncaring and cruel man, but when he comes upon the female lead of the story he slowly finds his true self again and gives up everything for her. He is determined to bring her to safety, even though it will mean the end of their time together. To her he is a knight in shining armour who is honor itself. There is hardly ever a dull moment in this book and I cannot wait to read it again!"
4,Radiates Romance!,"A wonderful story of a young girl who is saved by a boy, cherishes his memory for years, only to meet up with him under circumstances by which he is not acting like a hero. Griffen is only doing what he promised his Foster Father he would do, although it makes him look and feel very evil. Dom is a great character wimpy, whiney, selfish, spoiled, you hate him so much you are glad to know at the end he will be paying for all the terrible things he has done to Griffen over the years. Isabel and Griffin tear at your heart not wanting to seperate, it was very emotional, I could feel Isabel's grief. I wish the birth of her child(ren) would have been included in this book, I always look forward to this when the heroin is pregnant. St.John's writing style reminds me a lot of Garwood. This was a very good story, I would recommend it!"
3,A bit disapointing!,"I bought this book on the strength of Amazon.com's readers & reviewers (all Five or Four stars with the exception of one Three star) and I must say, I was let down. I found that the characters and/or the plot had nothing new to say; were in fact drawn as rather ordinary stock-romance-novel figures, (particularly the evil Dom, although I appreciated Ms. St. John's attempt to give him depth by flashing back to the episode of his father killing the puppy). The praise given for the character of Isabel was way out of league -- frankly I thought she was a bit dull for a heroine. I thought the attraction between the hero & heroine felt rushed; there was no sexual tension. I agree with the 3-star reviewer who said this is a good read -- it IS; but it just isn't superlative, 5-star writing like the other reviewers said it was, and certainly no keeper for me."
5,Medieval romance at its best!,"How can you not like Tina St. John's medieval romance adventures!?WLL is another winner with Isabel on her way to her betrothed, an Earl chosen by her guardian, King Richard, only to be kidnapped by none other than Griffin of Droghallow. Her childhood hero. He has changed though; there is no more heroic and gallant behaviour from the once golden boy. Now it's only raw passion and disillusionment from a fallen angel, a lost soul. Sounds good? You bet!In her third book, Tina St. John perfects a hero so courageous, dangerous, protective and sensual, I couldn't help but fall for him. Not only that, she toped it with a heroine who matches him in all actions and emotions,creating a perfect balance of exciting action scenes and loving tender ones. Nothing pretentious about Tina's style or her characters.I highly recommend White Lion's Lady to all you medieval romance fans out there!"
5,The Perfect Soundtrack for the Post World Insurrection,"As stated in the insert, this release is different from the others in the past, because unlike the ""live sound"" on previous discs, this one ""is an experiment in music invented or restructured on the computer"". And it's pulled off very well. For those who haven't been able to experience a live TchKung show, this disc also includes a 3:36 min. video file for both Mac & PC which gives the viewer half an idea of what the live experience is really like. This disc holds great music, great messages, and great political satire (or is it political truth?). Smash things up!"
5,Gets the job done well.,"I used this daypack to climb Buffalo Mtn (12K+), Torreys, Greys, and Quandary Peak in CO (all three 14ers).It's a decent pack. Rugged construction. The bladder worked fine although it was a bit too big for the hikes I made (always had plenty of water left over....but I guess it's better to have too much than too little....just don't like lugging the extra water weight up and down).Plenty of storage space and the mesh side pockets were fantastic for trail mix, munchies, and a camera."
2,A Texan view,"Mr. Craven should be ""commended"" upon his novel. He has elevated the eastern way of life to appear much more civilized and thus superior to the ""Texan"" way. The Texas characters in the book are portrayed as backward and borderline barbaric. Jason, on the other hand seems to be much more enlightened and cultured. I supposed upon finishing the book, I was to be ashamed of my home state, but rather I was more ashamed of Mr. Craven's portrayal of us Texans in the book. If he thinks so much of the Far East and their culture, maybe he should leave Texas and go there to live there instead. On the other hand, once I get past the hurt feelings, the novel did hold my interest and was full of action. I kept reading to find out who really was harassing Sybil, and what would finally transpire between Lint and Angela."
3,Works Well...But is Noisey,"The unit is easy to assemble and fun to use.However, it makes a bunch of noise when it draws in the pull rope.It is a great unit for the price...just wear earplugs or a music headsetwhen you use it."
1,You'll be disappointed,"This thing is entirely manual, which means that there is no suction. You put the soap and water on the carpet and then.... nothing. You may as well get down on your hands and knees and scrub, its the exact same thing, except that this thing i harder to push around then a nylon brush. If you just want a bunch of soap in your carpet, this is for you. If you want to wash your carpet... find something with power and suction."
1,THE WORST!!!!,This is not a shampooer. This is a toy. It is not even electric. I was fooled. I hope you won't be.
2,This is not it...,Was not exactly what I was looking for. I just failed to return it. Not a useful item for my needs.
5,Gain Fabric Softner,"Gain Fabric Softner is a great product. I had orginally tried it when I purchased it from my local supermarket. It has a great scent, and makes your clothes feel nice, next to your skin. So I couldn't pass up the bargain to buy it in bulk from Amazon.com. I'm a busy college student, and I need to keep different items on hand, and this is one of them. It's a great buy!!!"
3,Worth Reading,This isn't the best written book. I dislike how the author mixed first and third person perspectives - it just seems awkward. That said if you like the video game you will probably like the book. Some of my qualms with the writing may have come from the author attempting to make the text feel like the game.
4,Excellent read on an iPhone,"I was already a fan of Splinter Cell the game, and this book was immediately enjoyable. The story line was captivating and it was an easy read. I liked the first person perspective. The end was a little weak, though; I think, characteristically, Fisher would've handled things differently."
1,"Simplistic, Unrealistic, Common, Poorly Written Garbage","The plot is simple, predictable, and poorly written. The poor use of first-person makes it sound like an 8th graders ""What I did on my summer vacation"" essay.The worst part is that this book is no doubt marketed to young people who are familiar with the game, yet it includes very graphic gratuitous sexual dialogue in one of the chapters.The only reason I read this book was to make sure its content was suitable for my middle school brother who likes the game. I refuse to let him read it."
1,"Wretched, horribly written",I wish I would have read the other 1 star reviews before picking this up. It is horrible. I agree with another reviewer's opinion about the shoddy first person narration.. It really is very bad.
5,Great book!,"This book is great, a must read. you do not have to have any prior knowledge of splinter cell to enjoy this book, as i did not. The author of this book Raymond Benson (writing under the pseudonym David Michaels) does a Great job of pulling you into the story line. you will be dying to make it to the next chapter throughout this book. the only disappointment i had with this book is that it ended. i had to rush out the next day to buy the next book in the Splinter cell seriesTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Operation BarracudaWhich was just as good!!!"
2,Bland,"This book was unimaginative and unrealistic but if you are looking for a quick read to pass time or break the monotany on an airplane then it serves a purpose. For a top notch ""splinter cell"" spy guy, Sam Fisher sure ended up with a gun pressed to the back of his head a lot.Example of bad writing: One dinner with mystery guy scene described the entire meal from salad to main course and then said so and so started the conversation by saying bla bla bla. I'm thinking ""Not a single word was said before or during dinner?"""
