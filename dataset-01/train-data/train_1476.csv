3,Didn't get much enthusiasm,"My granddaughter likes a lot of things and she really likes putting things together. However, these links didn't do much for her. They fell apart too easily, and she was pretty much done after a few minutes (or seconds). However, they were great in the pool for playing and retrieving. But there are a lot of other things that are even better in pools. So, this item is a ""save your money, buy something else"" for me."
4,Fun Links,These links are very fun- most of the links have little animals on them. My son is 11 months old and still loves them!
3,Surprisingly Attractive,"This subtitled film is a documentary of sorts with no professional actors. It is a series of interviews interspersed with dramatic scenes of Tehran during a religious festival marked by self-flagellation and beautiful mournful chanting. The people themelves appear to be middle class and are surprisingly attractive, racy and modern in their thoughts and comments. A lot of attention is given to the youth--their courtship and mating patterns under a stern fundamentalist governement. I gave it only 3-Stars due to a general lack of structure and a lot of disconnected elements."
2,Boring,"Lots of scenes from Iran which for someone who travels there from time to time is not anything special. Kind of depressing melancholic mood, tone, sound, color. Depressing movie. Waste of time if you ask me - I wouldn't recommend it. Sorry."
5,"From Sam Horn, author of Tongue Fu!","Are you increasingly shocked by people's impolite behavior? Do you ever feel unsafe walking alone, even in your own neighborhood? If so, this book is for you. Morris shows how sprawl has reduced our overall quality of life and turned neighbors into strangers. Most importantly, he offers practical suggestions on how readers can create meaningful, fulfilling connections in their communities -- regardless of where they live. Read it and reap the benefits.- Sam Horn, author of Tongue Fu! and Take the Bully by the Horns"
3,Ani seems to have pulled some punches on this one!!!,"It seems that Ani has shifted from her gut wrenching, no holds barred lyrics in ""Dilate"" and ""Little Plastic Castle"" to a somewhat mundane and easy listening style in ""UP, UP....."" Sorry Ani, but i still love ya.."
3,"Little Plastic Castle vs. Up, up, up, up, up.......","Well this cd was alright. It wasnt as comforting as were recent CD's. I miss the righteous solo acustics that she use to do. I miss that. In little plastic castle i felt her feeling, in this CD i just felt like she was putting out another CD. Sorry Ani I love you to death but I have to give this cd 3 stars"
2,Not the Ani I know...,"This album departs from DiFranco's song style, obviously... But, unfortunately, it is not a good departure. She has traded in her incredible guitar playing for sloppy electronic malproductions. I can't see how anyone could like this album and apreciate Ani's others. I was originally excited that she released another album so quickly after Little Plastic Castle... but I wasn't so excited after rushing to buy this album. (Don't be fooled by ""Angry Anymore"")."
2,what has happened to her?,"i know that artists change and stuff, and that's awesome...i mean, look how she came from Not So Soft to Not A Pretty Girl or even Dilate. But from there it's definitely been going down. I loved the political-ness and originality of her lyrics (like not a pretty girl, IQ, out of range, etc.) but now all her songs are starting to sound like ""every pop song on the radio""!! The lyrics are so cliche....is this cuz of goatboy? I don't know...but i sorta want the pre-toally famous ani. i liked ani back when she was not the kind of name you heard around school, and now i go to a concert and see half my school there. i loved the close feeling of her stuff before she changed her style so drastically."
2,Not so up,"This CD is not nearly as good as I hoped. I had one recurring thought while listening to this CD, ""wow -- she could really sing if she would just cut loose with some good music."" The lyrics are neat and nice and her voice is good, when she sings, but the entire CD is held back by the music compilation.Some songs are just down right terrible. On one song in particular, I got the feeling that she couldn't think of anything to write and recorded the band just goofing off in the studio.If you want to hear some really good music from this genre, I suggest bypassing this CD and pick up a CD by Laura Love."
3,Not the greatest album Ani has put out,"Ani has always astounded me with her music. Ever since the first time I heard the song ""Shameless"" off of her Dilate album, I was drawn to her new and exciting style of music. I recently purchased ""Up Up Up Up Up Up"" and was very excited to listen to the contents of the cd. Although i fell in love with the song ""Jukebox"", I found that I ended up disliking half of the songs on the album. Some of the songs felt like they were missing something, and I would wait for something great to happen and would be left stranded. Don't get me wrong, it's a good album, but not one I would listen to over and over again. More like one that has a couple good songs that I program into my cd player so I don't have to listen to any of the songs I didn't find were worth listening to."
3,"experiments keep an artist vital, but UP is self-indulgent","I love Ani, ever since 1992 when she rocked out a tiny coffeehouse in Boulder - unusually insightful politically and musically brave (playing in triplets and off tunes) - but she falters badly in this album (that is still better than 90% of the dreck out there) - it's not so much experimental as it is self conscious and awkward. If you want evolution: Tom Waits, if you want punk folk: Ani DiFranco, but Ani's forgotten her strengths, indulging, instead, in hiding her heartbreak voice and Joni Mitchell-esque lyrics in bullhorns and fuzzy-laurie anderson-rap-funk-scat silliness - ""'tis of thee"" is the sole redeemer on this one, a little clunky to be sure (and sounding a tad like Independence Day), but honest and vital - I miss ya' Ani, haven't seen you fully yerself since DILATE - lookin' around the corner to the next one (and perhaps a studio version of ""Lack of Providence""?)"
4,Ani turns her back on expectations again.,"ani difranco is a moving target. Much of her art is about turning her back on, and walking away from, expectations--whether those are expectations of how she should act and what she should say as a woman, or the expectations of her fans on what her music should sound like and say. Fans will find this album quirky, but upon listening, they will realize that ani is trying on a new skin (or shedding and old one) again."
4,QUIT COMPLAINING!,"Let me start out by saying: this is an incredible album. It has more of a jam feel than any of her other albums, and you can just hear her and the band having fun. But now let me say that I am tired of hearing the old die hard fans complain that her music has ""changed,"" that she's not ""folk-punk"" anymore, and that this album isn't any good.Ani's music is growing, and we should be happy to be able to witness the evolution. Where her lyrics used to be brilliant because they were raw and in your face, starting with this album, her ideas get more complex, her metaphors take a few lines to unfold, her melodies are more complicated...This album will always be one of my favorites because it feels free, spontaneous, and innocent. It also marks the real beginning, I think, of her music with the band. Again, a great album from a great artist...even if she isn't still making the same music she did when she was 19!"
3,ummm...,"it's ani, yes. one cannot stress that enough. from the country-emotion in ""angry anymore"" [my favorite track on this album] to the opening, acoustic grrl-and-her-guitar ""tis of thee"", this whole album is, in my opinion, ani difranco's ""boys for pele"" [the tori amos album is which she shed pop sensibility to get to the heart of what she wanted to make, musicwise]. i don't particularly care too much for the majority of up^6, simply because most of it is uncharacteristically dry and preachy for ani's work...and some of the tracks, like ""trickle down"", i skip every time..but there are gems. ""tis of thee"", ""angry anymore"", ""virtue"", and ""jukebox"" among them."
3,S'Ok,"I am a beginning Ani DiFranco fan. I bought this CD second, and as a beginning fan I was not impressed at all. Some of the songs are good. 'Hat Shaped Hat' is very fun, 'Jukebox' has a good feel to it. ''Tis of thee' has a powerful message behind it. The other songs have their moments. But overall, I don't think this is a good album if you're buying it to see what you're in for."
2,"This is where Ani began to sink down,down,down,down,down.","This album is okay. Not great, not even really good, but okay. This was the beginning of the end of the great ANI ERA.I traveled all over to see her, bought all her albums, etc. After ""Plastic Castle"" the albums got progressively worse.If you're new to ANI, I recommend buying everything recorded before Up,Up,Up."
1,are my ears bleeding?,"i have never been a very big fan of Ani, i personally find her music terrible. unfortuantly, the music on this particular album is strikingly similar to most of her other works: bad! Her music style is not all that bad, but i cannot stand her choice of lyrics. Where does she come up with that stuff?"
5,Uplifting and Strong,I was fliping stations on my TV and saw Ani on Hard Rock Cafe Live. The next afternoon I drove to the CD store and bought UP Up Up...Some people don't like it but for someone who has never heard Ani before its great.
5,Ani is amazingly brilliant with her words.,"Wow, where to start? Ani is brilliant in this C.D. She is making us aware of things that we ourselves do that we never noticed before. She is telling us to see things from a different point of view. This is what you want if you want music that is 100% worth your time."
4,Almost like they never existed.,"Good book, but not great. Unfortunately, it is the only pice of writing on these 5 legendary cars that GM engineers built and raced in ""secret"". Lots of photos you won't find elsewhere, and it is the only place the incredible story of these cars is recorded. How funny that GM marketing ""commemorated"" (with the 1996 'vette) these cars, which they did not support, and actually axed when they found out about them. This story just goes to show what a driven group of individuals at GM were able to achieve with passion, means, and hard work - they were able to defeat the Ford racing machine and the legendary Cobras!"
4,Good but pricey,"This lab manual is very well written, having excellent pre-lab and post-lab questions and clear, if somewhat verbose, lab procedures. But $80 for a lab manual is really pricey, so for many it may not be worth it."
2,Expensive,"Book is falling apart after 3 labs because the binding is so poor. The labs require much extrapolation, because the concepts that are asked on the preliminary questions are not covered thoroughly. This lab manual doesn't go along with my physics class book at all which makes it difficult to do preliminary work. My professor is very good, so he takes the parts he wants us to use in lab and explains them in detail."
5,great,love the book give them to many people.really a great gift thanks so very very very much. Thanks thanks thanks thanks
3,"Okay, but not small enough","I think this could be a really effective tool for deep work, but the small size isn't small enough for my small hands. I'm a 5'1"" woman with proportionately small hands. At first it seems to fit okay, but when I'm really working and my hands get sweaty, my thumb/finger slips all over the place, and it becomes an ineffective nuisance. Someone needs to create an XS model."
4,My new toy - Thumbsaver,I really like my new tool but after using it for long periods of time your thumb starts hurting. My client's feedback is that it feels great for trigger points.
1,terrible,Product is not at all what I expected. Too hard so uncomfortable for patient and also the user. I would not recommend it to anyone.
3,Mmm... still not sure,"It is not as comfortable to use as I wished, so I almost never use it, but keep it with me all the time, in case I need some extra support for my thumb."
3,Limited Use,"First, I got the wrong size, which I couldn't really tell until I had actually used it. I have good-sized hands and got a medium. When I press hard, it's too long and cuts into the base of my thumb. I also don't like the way your thumb rolls around in it -- it should be more snug at the top. Aside from that, it works well on the bottoms of feet, spinal muscles, and any place that's wide open. Not so great for intricate work."
3,much needed support,I purchased this because I am starting to have pain in my thumbs after I do a lot of deep work. It does a great job supporting the thumb and I am not sore afterwards. Clients say they either can't tell a difference or at least don't find it uncomfortable. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that you can't feel anything through it. I will usually wear on one hand and feel the area before working on it with my other thumb to get a sense of what's going on. I think with time I will get used to it.
2,THUMBSAVER - Manual Massage Therapist Hand Tool,"Didn't really give me any additionally strength to increase massage time.Does not feel remotely as good to the recipient as a bare thumb.To see what I fell in love with, see the Acuforce Massage Star Massager."
4,Bought for my wife,seeing it was a gift i bought i couldn't tell you how it performs but the shipping was quick. It felt sturdy not flimsy or anything like that. I cant help review any more than that
5,Thumb Saver Review,"Great product, i love it. Able to get super deep without trying and helps keep my thumb in the right position. Shipping was super fast. I was going out of town and was a little worried it wouldnt get here before then but it got here the day we left which was nice. Thanks!"
3,Returned It,"I thought there'd be two for the price of $18.50, so I returned it. I've used these before and they work great, so I'm not saying the product itself is bad but it's a cheaper buy elsewhere. Oh, and returning it is more of a hassle than other things I've returned. I don't get why they don't just do free return shipping, it's not a heavy/bulky/expensive item to mail."
3,Hard to be fair,"Hard to be fair, b/c I measured and thought the size I bought would fit, but it ended up being too small and the tip of my thumb would jam down into it and hurt..love the idea, but don't want to spend MORE money on shipping it back for the right size."
3,not for extended cab,This product will not fit the Ford F350 4 dr extended cab only the Ford F350 4 dr crew cab
4,Great Product!,"I love this boombox, i just got it for christmas yeah early. i use it at work, my house, etc. i dont know how anyone is having a reception problem. i work in a warehouse surronding by steel, no problems. i put the antenna in the window and then the best radio on radio was in the warehouse! love SIRIUS!"
4,product as described - poor shipping,"The product did arrive as described, however I was dissappointed with the way it was shipped. The box for the boombox was not secure in anyway! It came in just the regular box and was not even taped shut. Anyone could have just opened the box with no hassel at all. Again, luckily mine was not tampered with, I was just surprised it was not secured a little better!"
2,Hard to get reception.,I always have to move the boombox from room to room to get reception. When I do finally get some reception I have to move the antenna all over the room to keep it.I wouldn't recommend this product until they work the reception problems out.
1,sportster boombox,"Do not buy this product ! I got mine as a Christmas present in 05 , so I could listen at work . I hung the antennae outside the building and got a weak signal , it still played , spasmodically , frustrating . After about 3weeks it stopped playing . I called sirius and after going through all the hoops they set up to get a return set up I sent it back . Its been six weeks since . I pay money for a service I don't get . I bought a piece of equipment that doesn't work and get no satifaction from the staff in the warantee dept. I'm told the product is on back order however it's available online or in stores . Who's fooling who? Oh how did it sound when it did work , in a word lousy . Didn't these people hear it before they decided to manufacture it ? All bass no midrange to speak of , these guy's obviously never heard of high range . Also the car mount unit I bought doesn't work . I haven't sent that back yet . I'm afraid to . All I can say is stay away ."
4,Iowa Rock,"Reissue of a very rare 1973 private press LP from this band from Humboldt, Iowa. Pretty decent folk rock stuff with one really great song ""Granite Feast"" that keeps me coming back."
5,Great for String Algae,"I've used these pads successfully for several seasons. I use an ultraviolet sterilizer for the floating algae (green muck) and the pads for the string algae. One time, I didn't use the pads, and the string algae was very bad; this told me that the pads really help in controlling that kind of algae."
4,Great selection of remixes and rare tracks,"This disc follows the remarkable response to Underworld's dancefloor anthem ""Two Months Off"". As with many hit singles, the track gets remixed, and those included here nice variations on the theme of the original (a bit of vocal tweaking, different beats, some lush pads of sound, but staying faithful to Karl Hyde's enthusiastic statement ""You bring light in!""The disc is worth hearing, however, for the album B-sides, ""Tiny Clicks"" and ""Headset"". Both are downtempo, very chilled and not quite characteristicly Underworld. Tiny Clicks is beatless, in fact, but features a lovely guitar pattern and Hyde's repetitive words, creating a warm, expansive atmosphere. The other track, ""Headset"" has some blips and bloops for percussion, and features a female vocalist explaining passersyby on the street. So, this EP gives you the hit you want, two remixes to enjoy and dance to, and two original/rare tracks to learn of the more ambient side of this great band."
4,depressingly overpriced.,"i would get this. but i'm not paying this kind of money for 2 b-sides and a radio edit. i couldnt care less about the remixes, since i've heard them off of the official site and they were terrible. i really really want to get this, but [money]??? i'd go for 12, MAYBE 15 AT THE VERY MOST. but i guess the search continues.by the way, i can't rate this, since i dont have it. so i'll give it a three. because two months off IS A DAMN GOOD TRACK.edit: i had to download the b-sides. they're great. 4 stars. headset is so perfect."
5,"Thank-you, Thank-you","Thank-you so much for writing this book.This was the first book I read after learning my eighteen year old son is gay. It brought me great comfort to know other parents went through the same kinds of feelings I did. I cried and yes laughed a little with each new story. It was easy to read, like reading someones diary but with their permission. The stories were honest and heartwarming. I am in the process of reading it again. This should be a must read for all newly told parents, their son or daughter is gay. Thank-you."
3,Get extended warranty,"3 months after my warranty expired, the color wheel failed...looking at the internet, this is a fairly common problem with Samsung DLPs.While the picture is great, I'm concerned that it barely lasted the warranty period before needing repair."
5,My precious,"Pros:Amazing HD pictureGood contrastGood set of A/V portsVivid colorsPIP and POPCute little start up soundFree TV Guide softwareCons:TV Guide software sucks! (but it is still optional)Analog/""Digital Cable"" picture so-soConclusion:This is the best DLP TV ever! I bought this TV 3 months ago at Circuit City who have the 50"" previous generation and this 60"" one. This 60"" one blows that one away and looked much better than any other LCD projection TV on the showroom. Right now this TV is cheap so get this one! If you are willing to spend about 1000 dollars more, then get the 1080p version."
3,Great HD Picture not so good standard,"As a Professional installer I've installed all of these models of DLP's and I love the HD Picture but standard resolution looks horrible compared to Plasma, LCD, and CRT. I believe the TV tries to overcorrect a non HD picture and creates heavy pixelazation and debris. If everything was HD and eventually it will be I would highly reccomend this tv but as of now you can't get more than 10 or so actual HD feeds. Also an upconverting DVD and even Standard DVD in 480 Progressive looks great but I would definelty spring for a Samsung DVD HD850."
5,"An old favorite, revisited","I wore Pheromone for many years, and somewhere along the line, I forgot to purchase a new bottle of my favorite, the body oil. When lightly applied, the scent is just wonderful. So glad I thought to finally place an order. Great service from the supplier - the package arrived promptly, and was carefully housed in a layer of bubblewrap."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed when I received my order and tried it. It was not what I expected at all. I had purchased the pheromone spray before from the HSN and it was very nice and the scent lasted all day. I received so many compliments and I just loved the smell. This item was very faint and does not last at all. I personally think it was a watered down version. It was not worth the money.
1,Spicy scent,"Arrived fast, I do not like the spicy scent. But would recommend vender :)Fast, arrived packed nicely, good prices, just not my scent"
3,No bueno,"As the office DJ, I'm always looking for new Christmas music. I bought this for the office Christmas party and couldn't find one playable song on the album. On some songs the lyrics were forced to fit the beat. On some, there was no refrain to get into; just when the refrain appears, the song wanders off and finishes with something totally different, like an essay that promises to address a topic and wanders off track.... The artists are talented and the songs are not typical, but none are pulled together. All songs are 5 to 8 minutes so its really an effort to listen to an entire number. Maybe as a gringo I'm missing something, but hey, if music is the universal language, this one just isn't speaking to me."
4,A look at the man and his impact,"This is a good look at H E F and his impact through a long career of preaching at very influential pulpits in New York City.Many of Fosdick's works remain in print or available and you will want to read his own words as a companion to this bio. A good place to start is...A Preaching Ministry: Twenty-One Sermons Preached by Harry Emerson Fosdick at the First Presbyterian Church in the City of New York, 1918-1925 by J. Barrie Shepherd (Foreword), David Pultz (Editor)."
4,Fun to listen to.,"I've seen Dazy Head Mazy live and they sound exactly like their album. If you want to listen to some good, fun music, this is a great cd."
1,so nazism is back,"Hey here's an idea. What if Hitler was right all along, only it is men, not jews, who are to blame for all the woes of the world. We should build a new Auschwitz and exterminate them all. Right Andrea? In my opinion, this is just as bad as any misogynist. It's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women's liberation movement back for so long."
1,Mein Kampf,"This book attempts to convince the reader that throughout history and into the present heterosexual sex has been the equivalent to rape (the male being the perpetrator of course) and that women who love men are ""collaborators"", which I assume is supposed to invoke the image of Nazi collaborators during World War II. Despite the premise of this book, female liberalization does not require male demonization."
5,Great,works awesome Works Great so very very very very very very very great Works Great so very very very very very very very great Works Great so very very very very very very very great
2,Should have had the missing songs,"I am a huge fan of Van Morrison and its unfortunate that they did not include, in my opinion, his best and most romantic song on this soundtrack album. For all those who love that song, its on his Moondance album- which is an incredible album- definitely go buy it! As for the other missing songs, just wait till the end of the credits and it lists all the songs played in the movie. When I heard into the mystic playing I hoped it was on the soundtrack, but was dissapointed to find out it wasnt. It has other good songs on the album, but not enough to make me want to buy it. Oh well- maybe a little less instrumental so they include every song played. PS- Listen to the whole ""Into The Mystic"" its amazing, the lyrics right after those in the movie are great and if you like that song, i know youll like Moondance and Van Morrison. hehe i could go on and on about him."
4,Great book!,"I am a post graduate student in Finland. I've been trying to find a suitable book which would take me a step further after Luenberger's Investment Science (Cochrane's book is a too large leap for me). This excellent book which does just that. It covers interesting topics such as Michaud's resampling, volatility surfaces and interest rate models. The treatment of various topics is rather short though. However, after each chapter Ruppert has a bibliography where he recommends additional reading for each subject.Text is extremely readable and even though I am not in MIT like some reviewers (possibly meaning that I might not be that smart) I found the text easy to understand and the examples in the book really help to elaborate the text. If you want some light reading that tells you a little about a lot, this is the book for you.In addition, you can find some nice R code for the book which a little bit of googling."
5,Amit,A must have book for anybody looking to learn statistics as applied to finance. Explainations are as elaborative as provided in other great books like Hull and Neftci. I strongly recommend this book!
5,The best teaching is from the heart!,"Different people teach the understanding of character in various ways because of who they are and how they see the world. It has been said, ""we teach who we are."" The act of teaching requires the courage to explore one's own sense of idenity. It is evident that the subject Carol is teaching is the very essence of who she is and what she lives. This gives great credibility to this wonderful work.The book is in the form of a workbook. Each page and section takes the reader through an evaluation of one's attitudes and willingness to see the power in each and every word that is spoken from our lips.Jesus Christ said, ""Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks."" If we are willing to walk through the process that Carol puts before one in this book, not only will our words change, but also our heart.I recommend to everyone I meet that this book is essential to their life."
5,Book and workbook COMBINED!,"Our ladies Bible study loves workbooks. And this one is a real treat and money saver. Many times when we do a study, we have to buy a book and a workbook. This one has both! The life-changing principles discussed in this book are easy to understand and practice."
5,Tres Tres Bien,"Tocqueville has always been, and probably always will be, known as the author of ""Democracy in America,"" a wide-ranging and perspicacious study of the early republic. However, it's when he writes about his own France, and its political system that he knows so intimately, that Tocqueville is at his best. Unlike ""Democracy,"" ""The Ancient Regime"" is neither sprawling, judgmental, nor inaccurate. These are excusable lapses, of course, in a grand work of poignant analysis, but such deficiencies do not mar ""The Ancient Regime."" This book is succinct, beautifully written, expertly researched, and incredibly original. Because Tocqueville was French and worked in the French government, this work is much more focused, specific, and accurate than ""Democracy"" (written hastily after a 9-month tour of America in 1830-31). It is simply a brilliant work, the creation of a curious and sometimes eccentric mind."
5,When does the next one come out?,"I have both Jazz-a-Bye Lullabye Classics and Jazz-a-Bye Christmas. I love them, my god son loves them and my nephews love them! I heard rumor that they were releasing another CD in mid Jan. 2002. I can't wait!"
5,As relaxing for adults as it is for little ones,"I purchased the Jazz-a-Bye cassette tape just before the birth of my second child. I thought it would be soothing music for the new baby, as well as my 2 year old. Well, not only is this music relaxing for my children, my husband and I enjoy it! Some music that is designed for young listeners can drive adults crazy. Jazz-a-Byes is a sophisticated blend of lullaby classics set to Jazz. It is as pleasurable for grownups as it is for children. I give Jazz-a-Byes as a gift at baby showers, but you don't need to have children to enjoy it."
5,Great for kids and adults,"I love the Jazz-a-Bye cd's. Cool, relaxing, instrumental jazz for your kids and for you. It was just what I was looking for- very cozy jazz that your kids will love to relax to. I bought it for lullaby music for my 2 and 5 year olds. I keep music on in their room at night, and this is perfect. This music also makes it more pleasant when I have to rock the little one in the middle of the night for whatever reason. I don't mind being in there as long as I need to because I get to hear the jazz-a-bye music. Love it for my kids but would also listen to it by myself."
5,BEST BOOK AVAILABLE ON KNIFE AND RAZOR COMPANIES,"This is by far the best book on Knives, Razors and the Companies that made them. The Author spent over 30 years researching to make this book and has hundreds of knife and razor companies and the dates they were in business. If you are like me and want to know how old your knife is than go no further. There is no other book out there that gives you this much information in helping you to identify and date your best knives or razors. It is most likely out of print again and there is a reason for it. Easy to read and in alphabetical order using the names of the Companies. I have learned much from this book that I would have never known about antique and contemporary knives. Other books may have some company names but this one has almost all of them.........A great book!"
3,Monsoon Parka,"Ordered an xtra large as I am usally wearing xl shirts and coats but this baby is at leats a xxl... I swim in it but I needed something fast, so I used it..."
4,Tommy Hilfiger Amelia Island striped pillow shams,"The shams appear to be well made, but the fabric is a bit thinner than I expected."
4,Go Diego Go Colorfelts Board,"I bought this game for my son to occupy him during a trans-Atlantic flight.This game is light enough to pack into a carry-on and bring along on a flight, as long as you have a pocket large enough to accommodate it.If only those little felt pieces would find their way into the packaging on their own..."
1,Why?,"I agree with roxie52 on this one. Why people elevate actors and actresses to the position on role model... what have they done?? What has Paltrow done but ride Brad Pitts coat tails to fame and them dumped him! Not that Pitt is any great talant (50 million for a wedding band lawsuit) These people are so good at pretending to be someone else, because they have no clue who they really are. Paltrow is someone who has never had to worry about anything in her life, except if her shoes matched her dress. Are we really idolizing the person or there money and fame? I read this book just to get some insight into Paltrow's life. Rich kid, rich parents that's about the whole story. Save yourself a few dollars and buy a good novel instead!"
1,Gwyneth Puke-trow,"Couldn't agree more with roxie and Glenn...she is nepotism at its worst. She was given everything in life. She is a less-than-average mumbling, lisp-infected ""actress."" She is not attractive in face or figure (and has terrible posture). She is an icon of NOTHING and has done nothing to better the world. Her best role was dating Brad Pitt. Harvey Weinsteing put a lot of eggs in her basket and had to make sure she remained popular. That is one reason she is where she is. The other is her parents. If they weren't who they are, she would be serving you at your local Denny's...ok, maybe that's too beneath ""Gwynnie""...she'd be your shampoo girl at the local hair salon..."
5,dog harness,Good quality harness works well with the matching Bamboo leash. Securely holds my 80lb dog. Easy to get on and off. I walk the dog at night and reflective strips work well.
4,"Great, a little snug","This is a very well made harness...holds back a 80 lb. German Shepherd/Great Dane mix with ease. Reflective stitching is a plus and built-in leash comes in handy when you're in need of quick and close restraint. Only thing to look out for is the sizing. It seems to run a bit small - if you order larger you can always adjust it smaller, not so much the other way!"
5,Great for your dog,I do not believe in collars around a dogs neck. These Bamboo Quick Control Harness gives you much more control and less harsh on your dog. These are the only harness I will ever put on my dog. They are very well made and should last for many years.
1,well atleast it colors your hair....,because if it didn't do that it would be worthless. it makes your hair dusty and hard. not to mention the horrible smell.. if you breathe this stuff in you might end up having nightmares of something...........it is overall a bad product
3,So-so,"I got this for my halloween costume and while it got the job done, it wasn't a product I'd look forward to using again. The coverage wasn't great. I had to use 2 cans to cover my updo and even then you could still kind of see my light brown hair under the white spray. It also made my hair very much like helmet and pretty much destroyed the curls I had spent so much time putting into my hair (since it weighed my hair down SO much.)"
1,"20 years later, still traumatized","My third grade teacher read us this book, back in 1990. Sitting on the carpet in a circle around her, we all cried our eyes out. I have never again read or even seen this book, but can still remember enough of the horrible details to cringe and tear up. I cannot imagine why anyone would subject a child to something like this. I guess it's supposed to be an anti-war message, but basically what I got out of it was that humans are awful, awful creatures, and I haven't really been able to shake that feeling since. So thanks a lot, Yukio Tsuchiya!!!"
1,Not recommended,"This is a ghastly, gruesome, and cruel story that I believe is inappropriate for children. The supposed message of the book is to stop all wars, but it oversimplifies the situation into a cute and heartrending picture book story that is completely ill-suited to its message and content. While based on a true incident, the book omits the full context which is needed to understand why the war had happened in the first place, which is why most people using the book are using it in high school--an age long past the picture book stage. Many personal decisions made during war-time have devastating consequences, but that doesn't make them an appropriate subject for a ""children's"" picture book."
1,Abhorrent,"I tried to put zero stars, but the computer wouldn't let me. I hate this book. Never in my life have I read anything this disturbing. The fact that this book exists, perterbs me greatly and I wonder what possible purpose these authors could have had in writing it. I am a teacher, and I would NEVER read this to my class. Again, I hate this book."
1,This book is HORRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"I am a 21 year old college student, who was forced to listen to this story in my choldren's lit class (used to illustrate what we should NOT read to children in our future classrooms). This book graphically describes the slow, painful, torturous deaths of three innocent elephants at a Japanese zoo. Yes, it did really happen.. and yes, war is awful... but there is no need for this type of book to be purchased or read by ANYONE. My entire ADULT class sat through this horrible book not only crying but also wondering why if these zoo keepers loved their elephants so much why didn't they quickly end their suffering with a bullet? The book implies that American troops are the ""enemy"" which is the reason these poor creatures have to die. Great... inaccurate ... message to share!"
5,Thought provoking,"I teach Grade 5 children and the unit of work we were studying was ""World Peace"". We had read ""Sadako"" and talked a lot about WWII - then this book was recommended to me. My students sat enthralled as I read it.(I had forewarned them that it was very sad) It produced lots of great discussion and helped re-inforce the impact that war has on people and societies. An excellent book for older students."
5,"Genius, YES, ABSOLUTELY FOR CHILDREN","This book made me cry, horribly.This is NOT an easy book. It's not lighthearted. It's honest, real, brutal, and painful. Death and war are a part of our lives and those that would shelter or hide a beautiful account of a part of human history from children are committing an agregious mistake. Children will know death. They will lose grandparents, pets, friends. They will know war, from parents and family in the military to GI Joe cartoons.This story presents a real account of the pains and consequences of war. It is a necessary piece of literature, absolutely appropriate for children."
3,Not a Children's Book.,"This book is beautiful and sad. You will cry a lot. Read it once, then don't read it again, unless you want to cry.This book is absolutely not for children, I am appalled that anyone would ever try and sell it as such. It is much to horrific and heart wrenching for children. Especially at a stage in their lives when they are too young to be able to do anything about it."
5,Read it if you have a heart.,"It is one of the most touching books I read. My teacher(I'm in 8th grade) read it to us this week and she was weeping while reading it, and I started crying as well. It is a wonderful story, the class was dead silent as we listen to it be read. I can honestly say it was one of the best stories I've read and please, if you have a heart, Read it."
1,Downer Elephant Story,"This story is horrible! I can't imagine why the people who reviewed gave it high marks! The people in charge of these elephants allowed them to starve rather than to euthanize them. They made one puny effort to put them down and then just gave up rather than trying, say, Cyanide, or a rifle, or even a knife to the throat. They just watched them suffer and suffer and... And this book is marketed for CHILDREN!The pictures are good, but that is all. I bought it with the idea of giving it to a school library. Blech!"
1,Waste of $5.00!!!!,"Pill crusher totally does NOT work!!! And the pill cutter/splitter's blade is weak & bends when you cute which leaves strange sized pieces of your pills!! I guess you could use it for the storage section, if you carry 3-4 pills only!! I will say the concept of this product is great, but they missed by a long-shot!!"
3,You require to be in sequence.,"Whenever a new author is encountered, much time is allowed in order for me to get into both story and style. Seldom do I go beyond the first three chapters before a decision is made to either continue for the sake of enlightenment, what have I missed or just plain ""No Thanks"".I am retired and no longer have to ""work"" at anything.This book was different. The third chapter came and went. I wanted to get into the story and liked the style and prose. However; it became apparent that I was a few volumes out of sequence. Some authors of epic tales, work hard to allow for the stand alone reader to catch up or at least catch on to the story line. I found characters I would have liked to know more about but their development had taken place in previous works. That's unfortunate. So, untill I can determine which title by this author is actually the beginning of the story line, this book will reside on a shelf, unfinished."
5,Did You Know that Microsoft Windows XP has FREE ability to make Narrated Powerpoint Presentations?,"I didn't know - and this book showed me how to use it. It is so easy to create a narrated powerpoint presentation, and give you the ability to distribute as needed.I cannot believe how easy it is to create movies using my video camera, and even better, the softare is FREE (Look in your ""START <ALL PROGRAMS>"" to find it.This book could NOT make it easier to take full use of the program.I lead a business unit and now pre-record and narrate all of my powerpoint presentations, which has eliminated the need to give multiple presentations on the same topic. This has reduced my travel, time needed to present multiple times, etc.I looked at a number of other books on the Microsoft software package, and this one is the easiest to use by far. YOU WILL BE AN EXPERT AT CREATING VIDEO BLOGS OR NARRATED POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS IN LESS THAN A FEW HOURS using this book."
4,Great for the price!,"I bought this card to play Battlefield 2. I wasn't sure if it would work but when i installed it, it worked great! It also worked awesome on all my other games. I was pretty amazed because it was so cheap. I do have one problem. They sent me an x300. So this product is actually and x300. It must be a typo or they just sent me the wrong item. Either way im happy bacause Battlefield 2 works. Thnx"
4,A pleasant surprise,"For the money, this was a pleasant surprise. It has a great sound. I shared it with a couple of celtic musicians who commented on the great sound."
3,meh,"The drum I received is not as vintage or ethnic looking as the photograph makes it appear.Mine is white with nails holding the head on. There are no designs or patterns.One of the 4 braces to hold the drum was missing a nail which made the whole construction loose. I was able to fix it though.Sound quality is average, not 'boomy' like another reviewer claims."
2,Meh.,"I received this Bodhran very quickly from Amazon. It was true to size, though felt a little chintzier than I expected. I guess I assumed it would be a little heavy, but this is a very light drum. My big problem with is were two finger prints on the drum head in what I'm guessing is enamel paint, very obvious and plain to see; very sloppy workmanship. Even if I wasn't giving this as a gift (which I am), this is unacceptable. I am returning this and have already purchased ""Trinity College TB-3 Bdhran with Black Rim"" from a different seller on Amazon as a replacement."
3,The Biker's Choice,"This is Lynyrd Skynyrd meeting Pat Travers. The Regulaters play traditional southern rock with a little more distortion than was used in the 70's, and it's obvious why these guys are so popular among bikers."
4,Good Value at $17.99,"I purchased two of these at $17.99. They are well built and fairly comfortable. They tend to put pressure on the back of the thigh, which may get annoying after a period of time. For $17.99, they are a good value. I just went to order a couple more and the price is now $29.99. These are not a good value at that price. So, 4 stars at $17.99, but only one star at $29.99."
2,A premature memoir,"Prosec's view of life, even just angling and love, from the elevation of >26 years is underwhelming, especially compared to his pictures which are little devotions for my eye. By comparison, his topic and his prose here is like reading a cloying love letter from camp.Keep drawing, Jim!"
1,THIS BELT SMELLS SOOOOOOO BAD,THIS BELT SMELLS SOOO HORRIBLY BAD!!! I TOOK IT OUT OF THE PLASTIC AND AIRED IT OUT FOR OVER A WEEK IN A SPARE BEDROOM. THE WHOLE DOWNSTAIRS SMELT OF THIS ODOR SO I HAD TO THROW IT OUT. I COULD NOT STAND TO EVEN RE-PACK IT!WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BELT!
3,an unique writing style,The author divides the book up by writing from the different characters' perspective. There is an underlying romantic storyline that gives the story more depth. The ending will surprise you.
5,Buckaroo Beef is great!,"I have been buying this product for years. All three of my small dogs love it! It's a fast and easy breakfast to give your pet for those of us who rush, rush, rush in the morning. I give each of my dogs 1/4 of a patty, and thier regular dry dog food in the morning. My pets love me for it, and yours will too!"
3,Good for the Reproductions,"Get past Thomas Hoving's steam-rolling ego (I doubt it's a coincidence that he put a photo of himself on the front cover alongside the ""Greatest Works of Art of Western Civilization;"" he obviously considers himself one of them) and the contents of the book itself are very nice. It's a great resource simply for the high-quality reproductions inside."
5,"Yep, he's right","Thomas Hoving is a an amazing writer. (Tom I tried to email you as you request in your amazon review - but your address bounces - maybe you could email me as I'd love to ask you a couple of questions about one of your books.) What is the greatest gift that we can be given? - the gift of deeper perception. Thomas Hovings works open up 'new ways of seeing' after reading his works, I've seen art in a far richer and sophisticated way. Thanks Tom - send me an email as I'd love to ask you some questions about your other book - The cross of the confessor. (10/10)"
2,Will need to be replaced in a little over a year,"Purchased this Item April 2010, Dead May 2011, so it seems to die out quick like other after markets... definately not worth the 124.99 I paid for it at the time.... its cheaper now.... but for a lamp thats only going to last a year.... you can find cheaper options to do the same thing."
4,Does the job,This is a replacement lamp for HDTV. It was expensive but not as much as the original equipment. It does the job fine but the real test will be in how long it lasts. The last aftermarket lamp we bought did not last very long.
5,Replacement Lamp,It was time to replace the lamp in my Panasonic LCD TV. I was pleased with the packaging and the appearance of the lamp. It installed easily and is working well. It was a good esperience.
3,It's good but it's missing something,"If you're looking for that new age vocal music that you heard on the Merlin television commercials, it ain't on this CD. Otherwise the CD's alright for a TV soundtrack"
5,The best music for TV I've ever heard,"This is one of the best epic soundtracks my ears have ever had the privelage of listening to. Jones writes masterful music that always knows when to be bold and daring or soft and subtle. Any film music fan who enjoyed Jones' music in ""The Last of the Mohicans"" or any other fantasy-oriented score should pick this one up. Oh, and about the music you heard on the commercials - no, it's not on the CD, and Jones did not compose it. However, it was practically a xerograph of ""Titanic,"" so get that CD if that's what you're looking for. ""Merlin"" contains the music that actually showed up in the miniseries."
3,spitz,"This is a fairly ill album, royce throws down a ill track like always and krs1 kicks it, everyone else on the album rhyme pretty good, their are much better albums you can get but this gets pretty original, which is the best you can ask for if you got a good flow, well not really but you know what i mean"
4,"So ""Wrong"", It's Right","I'm not an AH scholar. Before this recording, I was only familiar with his work in Tony William's Lifetime II and with Bill Bruford (solo & UK). Wow! This is hard-boiled stuff, yet with a beauty and elegance all its own.On a side note, Chad Wackerman is a revelation. Curse you, Frank Zappa, for that infernal '80s drum-machine sound!Like I said, I'm not an AH scholar, but now I'm a fan."
5,Amazing,"I listened to this at least a half dozen times in the first week I had it. All the way through. I can't think of much higher praise than that to give to a record. The sticker on the album refers to Holdsworth as the greatest guitarist to walk the planet and call his performance ""godlike"". Ordinarily I'd scoff at a claim like that. Now I'm forced to admit they may be right. The sound is first rate, the soloing heroic and the trio itself astonishing. If you call yourself an electric guitar fan, your collection is not complete without it. This was my first Allan Holdsworth. It wasn't my last. Wow!!!!!!!"
5,allan holdsworth a fusion icon,"I,ve listen to Mr.Holdsworth since i was 17yrs.old. always constantly changing and improving his craft he has always been under rated. its time now to give the man the props he deserves he,s always and will be an innovator in his instrutment,s field. and will never cease to amaze his fans and newcomers. my first time listen to him was Tony Williams believe it lp and i have been a fan every since. to all the AH. fans you know who the man is to all newcomers you won,t be the same listener of this instrument after hearing him. bottom line most players and Im talking big names after hearing holdsworth go back and redo their homework after hearing the man. He is in that elite group of the great ones and to those who don,t know simply listen you may not be impress by all his material like i am but im sure you will find something that will grab your ear and won,t let go"
2,All Night Wrong,"I have always read about the guitar exploits of Allan Holdsworth but I had never heard him play, so I asked for a Holdsworth CD for Christmas.I have listened to this CD in it's entirety on three occasions over the past two weeks and I have to say that I was not impressed. This is a live album and Holdsworth, although technically proficient on the guitar, is extremely boring here. I was expecting lightning fast jazz licks, but instead he sounds like he is playing an electric keyboard instead of a guitar. I would say that this CD is for extreme jazz fans only."
2,Was expecting more,"Kept reiterating the viewpoints of virginity -- either to get it over with, a rite of passage to adulthood, or a ""gift"" to give someone special when the time was right. The profiles on individuals talking about their virginity -- well, I was better off finding a more friendly book to read on the topic. It's very clinical and detached, the writing style. Which was ironic, considering the title's ""An Intimate Portrait"" - obviously tongue in cheek metaphorically. It didn't produce any surprises or in-depthness."
2,Overview of Surveillance/Not Very Good,"The topic is covered like a light coat of peanut butter on hot toast.You can tell that there is alot more to be added but you just don'tever get it, the jar was put away before the value (peanut butter), wassufficiently applied to make it taste good."
3,For fans only !,"Well, what can I say. This informative book is not what I would call a beginners guide to Kate Bush-fans, but I'm sure it wasn't meant to be either. Lots of great pictures not only of The Godess of Music herself, but also of some of her ancestors. You see, half the book is about Kates father, and her fathers father etc. So if you're looking to find out why Kate is Kate, this is the book for you. At the same time I have to say that this is not a biography. It contains a discography, but the book was released in 1983... In other words not nearly a complete discography. All in all a good book by Fred Vermorel, but as I mentioned earlier -not for Bush-beginners."
4,Oldie but Goodie,"Charles Erland is an old album but its good, before the music got muddled and the lyrics X rated. This is Jazz at its finest, relax with a glass or wine or put on and play in the background for picnic, barbecue or while doing homework. Works like a charm."
5,Charles Earland and Melvin Sparks....can't get better than that!,Great album. Every track is fluid and exciting to listen to over and over again. Charles and Melvin Sparks on guitar is a great combination!..True masters at their craft! You will not be disappointed with Black Talk...Great job on the remasters.
5,The Genius Behind Focke-Wulf,"Interested in what happened to one of the greatest aviation engineers of the twentieth century? Interested in the genius behind the amazing developments in air warfare that came out of Germany's Third Reich? Then this book is for you! Dr. Kurt Tank, a contemporary of Willy Messerschmitt (the OTHER aviation genius of the twentieth century) was by far one of the most influential aircraft engineers to ever live. Follow his career from Germany, to Argentina after the war, to developing the trans-sonic fighters of the Pakistani Air Force! A must for WWII aviation enthusiasts, and students of aviation history!"
4,Great Techstep album,"This is my first Ed Rush/Optical CD (I'm relatively new to the Drum N Bass scene), But given the quality of the tracks on Chameleon, I can't wait for the next album. It might be a bit heavy for people really new to DnB, but if you like a good techstep, neurofunk and even a bit of jazzstep in your listening queue,you cant go wrong with this one! The sweet drum n bassed version of Weezer's ""hashpipe"" (Bloodmoney) is easily one of the most high energy tracks on the album!"
4,Exciting!,I love to keep students busy in the classroom. Diller's book includes a checklist of items to include in literacy stations as well as many photographs that inspire educators to set up these stations!
5,Literacy Stations In Kindergarten,"If you want to set up literacy stations in your classrooms (k-2), or you just want to re-vamp the ones you already have, then Debbie Diller's book is very helpful. The key to successful stations is to teach the stations from the beginning of the year. Use all station materials in your teaching, students will then model this teaching when they go to the station for independent practice. Great ideas and useful resource for teachers of literacy stations. Great summer reading for teachers!"
2,Hard to read charts,"The book information is interesting, but the charts and images are difficult (almost impossible) to read on the Kindle even with the font in the largest format."
3,Excellent book!,This is an amazing book! I took it with me on the plane and lost it...so I re-ordered it on-line. I am a kindergarten teacher and use a lot of these ideas for literacy centers. Her ideas are great!
5,Very helpful,"I am a second year second-grade teacher, looking to improve my reading centers. This book is very practical, but also provides rationales for why to provide each center, and gives concrete examples of adaptations for different grade levels, K-2. The book addresses many kind of centers, too, more than I would even try to implement in one year. Unlike other books that are mainly about reproducibles and activities (although there are some) this book shows you how you can use classroom materials you already have, and adapt lessons previously taught, in your centers. I think this is going to help me get off to a strong start this year."
5,Great book,"I finally ordered this book and am so glad I did! It gives great, practical ideas. I will be using literacy stations in my kindergarten classrooms so that students who are not reading in my guided reading group will have literacy skills to work on. This book gave me a lot of different ideas that I hadn't thought of. Great resource, love Debbie Diller books!!"
4,Great ideas!,This book offers many great ideas that balance student-initiated activites and teacher-initiated activites. The activities also incorporate all aspects of literacy.
3,Debbie Debbie,"SOME GOOD INFO. SOME NEED TWEAKED FOR ""YOUR STUDENTS"" OR MAYBE ""YOURSELF""OUR COUNTY HAS REALLY PUSHED DEBBIE - SO I THINK I NOW HAVE ALL THE BOOKS BUT LITTLE TIME TO READ THEM ALL"
4,helpful,This book has helped me do a better job of creating meaningful literacy work stations for my 2nd graders! It's a wonderful resource!
1,False Prophecy,"Please pay no attention to this book full of false prophets and thier prophecies. It is more likened to a guidebook for a dungeons and dragonesque game where you can find out what prophecies may gain you power or destroy you, but as a book of facts???...forget it. Fantasy and FALSE!"
4,A wonderful little story!,"My children love this video. They play it, just as most toddlers tend to, over and over. It is truly entertaining and portrays the true meaning of Christmas. The story centers around an orphan by the name of Christina. From a series of misadventures she learns about love and forgiveness. I heartily recommend this to all parents of small children."
2,Had this for 7 years and will see if warrenty covers it,"I have had a set of Calphalon Cookwear since I got married in 2003. For the past year the 10"" (1390) and the 3 Qt saucepan (5003) have had some type of hard carbon burns (not sure if that is what you call it). Mind you I have used these almost every day. I don't put them in the dishwasher, always wash by hand, and I don't use metal tools with them and I wait for them to cool down before I wash them. I am going to send them to their office to see if they are covered by the warranty. I will let you know what I find out!"
1,Almost junk,"Never advertise a product that isn't what it is. Not a non-stick. After only a week of use, my eggs (sunny side up or scrambled) are sticking and I have used many types of oils and preheated the pan to different levels in the hopes of having them not stick. How can such an expensive pan work like a regular pan when it's supposed to be non-stick?I never have to use Scotch-Brite pads to clean any of my cookware. And yet, I have to on this pan in order to get everything off of its surface. Even pasta sauce sticks to this pan after I let it cool before cleaning.If you want a regular pan that looks like a non-stick, then this pan is for you. If you want a non-stick pan, buy a quality non-stick that only cost 1/3 the price. I'd go as far as saying never buy Calphalon. This is the second anodized ""non-stick"" I have bought from them that is anything but non-stick. I was hoping this new infused technology is an improvement over my previous anodized stirfry. It is not. Same old junk."
1,Pure Junk,"This pan is a pure junk. There are already a couple of reviews and the people recognize that this is NOT a non-stick surface. This is true to the very end, I mean everything sticks like hell.So, if it sticks, why not buy a stainless steel pan instead. All this polymer invention is complete b**ls**t !!! It doesn't do anything ! I am returning this and I'll get a 1 yr-lasting nonstick calphalon from amazon."
4,Excellent Book!,"I purchased this book after I heard Bloomfield speak at a conference I attended in San Diego. I am a counselor and I have found the book to be an excellent source for myself as well as my patients to read. It is well written, excellent information and easy to understand. It is a good reinforcement for my work. Bloomfield's approach reaches out to the whole person--it is well balanced. The book would be excellent for anyone to read -- be informed about the wonderful benefits of the herbal treatment of anxiety and depression. The use Prozac etc is out of control!"
4,Help for anxiety,"I believe this book empowers individuals to take control of their own health,well-being and anxiety. The chapters are laid out well, with suggestions for herbs,and conditions each one targets. Topics include; herbs, imagery, music, diet, aromatherapy and pressure points for relief of anxiety, and so much more. Meditation is covered, and Bloomfield explains psychological triggers for anxious responses. He makes understanding anxiety easy for lay-people. This book is a resource to turn to and explore again and again for alternatives to traditional medicine. I highly recommend it and have personally benefited from the helpful ideas within."
4,Like advertised,"This book is older , but the info is still relevant and gives me more ideas on how to deal with anxiety. It is an addition to my collection."
4,I have found this reference to be be very handy to have.,"This is a good reference, and in fact the only one I've found, for translating English into Attic Greek. It provides a handy section in the back for Latin and Greek names. The only problem I can find with the publication is that the English at times can be somewhat 'dated'. Marc Mitchell"
5,Just what I wanted,"My mother's old phonograph died, and she has a whole stack of ""classic"" old 78s and 45s. She also has a classic old radio, and she likes that stuff. I have a great collection of old folk music from the 60s on 33 LPs, that I worry about. I bought the TEAC thinking at least she could play her records (have a 33 turntable, one of the last). When it arrived I discovered it has line-out jacks on the back, and I am now busily transferring my album collection and Mom's to the computer, and then I will make CDs of all of them! The records can become keepsakes, and we can listen to the music as many times as we want without ""wearing them out."" Great sound, great radio, great 3-speed turntable for the price. The speakers are not real hi-fi, is the only drawback, and I would have liked an auto-changer, but for this price I'm very happy."
1,Very Dissapointed,"I was hoping for some interesting reading. Since Friedmans teachings are rooted in the most basic of economic fundementals, I expected a new and novel critisism of the free market to discover. Unfortunatly what I recieved in this book was a recap or index of anchient leftist elitist arguments against the free market, devoid of any objectivity or common sense whatsoever. If there was a selection for zero stars this book would be the perfect candidate"
1,Not so good of a book,"The analysis is weak. The criticism is unwarranted. The argument just does not add up. If you hate Friedman, you might like this book. It was written for a witch hunt."
1,Terrible book,"I was hoping for a clear and critical essay of Friedman's ideas of free-market capitalism. (Perhaps something in the tradition of Keynes?) Instead what I got was a propaganda filled hack job: Rayack does a poor job countering any of the obvious successes of the free-market system and he does an even worse job tackling Friedman. Rayack has an obviously biased understanding of the economic and political situation in Chile; He assigns blame on Friedman and the free-market for problems in the country, in 1987, when this book was written. However, since 1987, Chile has had one of the most vibrant and dynamic economies in South America. This is a shallow and coarse work. Do not even think of buying this book when you can borrow it from a library: You will be exercising your ""free choice"" not to waste your hard earned money."
3,"OK, not as good as expected","Received batteries within timeline that vendor promised.Batteries are rated as having the highest mAh available, but I see little to no difference between these generics and the Nikon brand...other than price.In fact, I'm frequently puzzled by how quickly they lose charge. I bought two, both behave the same way. And yes, I followed the charging instructions!"
3,A decent hold down strap,"I have had 3 or 4 of these straps over the years. They do hold fairly securely.There are several downsides, however. They seem to last me about 3 years before they begin to disintegratete. They are difficult to take off when necessary. They are a pain to get good and snug.All that said, they do work well enough and I have yet to find a better answer."
5,Great cutter,i have been using my cutter for quite some time and love it. It did take some getting use to which did not surprise me. I can tell a difference in the stress on my hand when I used it.I would recommed it for anyone with carpal tunnel syndrome.
4,Martelli Rotary Cutter,"I have preciously owned a Martelli 45mm Cutter, and I reordered when mine wore out. I was sent a 60mm cutter instead, and have not tried it yet. Did not return the 60mm."
3,Works well but a little fragile,"After having joint replacement in both thumbs due to osteoarthritis, using a ""regular"" rotary cutter wasn't easy and I wanted to protect my hand joints! This ergonomic cutter works well and is much easier on the thumbs and wrist, but the little spring which closes the cover automatically didn't last long. It's a tiny wire and it just popped off. I can't figure out how to get it back on, so was disappointed in that mechanism, but am pleased overall with this cutter. It still works without the spring but the blade isn't covered - the little cover just swings now.Purchasing through Amazon was great - good prices and I got it quickly."
5,Rotary Cutting made even easier for those with disabilities,"I have struggled with rotary cutting because of the awkard position of the wristand hand is not natural to me. I have some carpul tunnel in my cutting hand, sogripping a regular cutter is difficult.Using the Martelli Ergo is very natural and easy. It requires very little pressureto cut. The movement is natural as you move your hand and arm.This is a great product for those with hand disabilities."
1,no pinyin,No pinyin in this- the description didn't comment on it so had nothing to go on. Wouldn't have bought it otherwise.
3,I'm not sure...2 or 3 stars...,"I am a John Zorn mega fan...but this one is more more less than I expected...And if there are more than 50 used CDs, there will be a reason..."
5,Cool instrument; incorrect description,"Be aware that the product description Amazon has printed describes the Brunton ADC PRO, not the Summit. I would suggest a trip to Brunton's website to get the skinny on each, then make your decision."
3,"Still working out the ""bugs""","Well I expected the ""world"" from my ADC Summit, and despite some features that work quite easily, I still am very confused how to calibrate other functions. The instructions are your typical ""you must be dumb"" if you can't follow these simple directions, but even my many years of education don't seem to be helping! I am still trying to figure some things out, so I will hold judgement till later.Later, has come and gone. I contacted Brunton for some help in calibrating current baometric pressure and altitude readings. I received no response, so therefore I would like to lower ranking of this product even more because of the lack of support.Update: Wow, this thing is much worse than I thought! Back-light does not work, calibration is impossible, and Brunton offers no support. Save your money and find another product!!!! Star rating: 1"
1,If I could give it a zero...what a terrible product!,"Avoid this product. I have wrestled with this horrible device for weeks, scouring the user manual, trying to sort it out. Its functions are not intuitive, you can easily get lost in a maze of sub-functions. First of all, it does not compute true altitude, it computes density altitude, which is meaningful to pilots (of which I am one) but useless as a tool for gauging...altitude (also occasionally handy to pilots.) This morning, after weeks of experimentation trying to calibrate the barometric pressure, the device started beeping every 30 seconds, I don't know why. My neighbor had his burn barrel going for the spring limb clean up. Without a second thought, I tossed the Brunton in. Haven't felt this good in a while. Just wish I had crushed it first. I have never had a piece of electronics actually enrage me (okay, my first laptop, but I eventually got that going right) and strongly urge you not to get this hideous product."

2,The Baseball Counting Book,Near the end of the book some of the pages appear to have been stuck together so there are big places where instead of the picture you have white patches.
1,Not for color laser printers,"According to Avery customer representative, these CD labels are only for black & white laser printers. For color printers you must buy #6692. Laser colors will peel/flake off from # 5698."
4,labels,"They are fine if you make your image larger than needed as they aren't perfectly aligned, so you will have white on one edge if you don't get your image overlapping on all sides."
1,Don't Work With Samsung Laser Printers,"I purchased these over the cheaper Ink Jet labels specifically because they were designed for laser printers. The first label I printed was a mess of peeling toner within seconds of being applied to a disc. A day later, the toner still peels off by rubbing a finger gently over anything printed. Maybe its my specific Samsung printer which has the issue, but I've never experienced this issue with standard paper.I plan on returning these labels and may try the color laser labels.I added an extra star simply because the label itself is well manufactured, easy to apply (even with just a jewel case)."
1,NOT as advertised! For CDs only!,"I ordered Avery 5698 because Amazon's picture and description very clearly show this product is designed for CD -and- DVD. The product I received was indeed 5698, but the package doesn't match the Amazon photo. These (5698) are CD -only- labels. I called Avery and the CSR said that Avery no longer makes a Laser-printer-compatible label for DVDs: it was discontinued years ago, she said, but didn't have the product number in her computer system, hmm! She claimed no knowledge of the Amazon web site but said it must be wrong but she couldn't check. It's hard to believe somebody at Amazon is using Photoshop to alter the product appearances, and is misrepresenting the product description! That doesn't make sense. I think Avery screwed up. SEE ALSO Bill's review of Avery 5692, which has a similar problem of misrepresentation."
5,Good product,I always like Avery products. These have been working great for me as I am coping all my lp's on to CD's.
3,:-},"SOMETIMES U GO 2 A CLUB & THY PLAY THE SAME OLD & WORE OUT MUSIC,BUT THIS IS NEW,& NOW THAT THE LATIN STYLE IS IN...THIS SONG WOULD REALLY GET THE DANCE FLOOR PACKED!"
4,"Not perfect, but for the price it's great.","I don't understand the people that disparage this product. For $11 what do you expect? I still think it's a great deal. It feels substantial, like it's made of metal (aluminum, maybe?). It affixes to my tripod easily, and my only complaint (-1 star) is that it allows the binoculars to move axially around the screw (that attaches to the binoculars) if you twist them a bit. However, for the $11 that I paid I can go out and get a star washer for $.05 at the local hardware store to fix that. I'm very happy with my purchase overall!"
3,"works, but...",So the rubber came of on this item by the second time I used it. Inexpensive and it gets the job done...but I expected more for sure.
5,Tivoli + IPod = Awesome,"I bought this product to play MP3s through my Ipod at work. However, I also use it to listen to the radio. The tuner is great because I am now able to listen to all of the FM stations in my area. With my old radio, I was only able to get one station at work. I also bought a second Tivoli at home for the same purpose and the battery runs for a very long time without recharging. This gives me the ability to take the Tivoli into any room and also allows me to listen to my ipod without the headphones."
5,jelly bean benitez music,great music from a great artist that we havent heard from in a long time.the shipment arrived quite fast. i will surely be looking out for similar music from the eighties.
3,jellybean?,"well.. probably i've buyed this cd just for a one song-sidewalk talk, with madonna as background vocal for my madonna collection. well.. something as a documentary about a time in a early 80'S! not to die for but nice!"
2,Trendy jargon galore,"This is a fascinating topic and some useful data is provided, but that is all. Surprisingly, this book was given quite an appropriate review in the journal, Ethnomusicology. Its style is an example of what is wrong with academic writing today. Unfortunately, the publishing establishment tends not to notice that such books are intentionally written so as to be inpenetrable to readers. Academics write this way to avoid criticism. Since nobody can tell what exactly they mean, nobody can challenge them or prove them wrong on any points. Some readers feign complete understanding of such books in order not to seem ignorant. Presses should not exascerbate the problem further by printing such things."
2,Dutch New York,"While there was some interesting info in this book, most of what is written was pretty much copied from other writings. Since the New Netherlands court transcripts are available online free of charge, this book offers very little new information. This one was a disappointment."
5,The ultimate Porphyria resource,"GET THE BOOK !!! Don't waste your time and energy scouring the net for information, this book has it all (and then some). Includes the most comprehensive drug list ever found. I took the book to the hospital when I was there for a week. All the nurses, doctors and specialists that came to my room were very interested and impressed with the book. And it was nice to have one solid reference book at my bedside to insure my safety and answer any questions that I (and my doctors) might have. An invaluable resource."
5,"Scholarly, Impeccable, Comprehensive, Easy to Understand","This book on a misunderstood or unknown disease is most comprehensive, well written, easy to understand and will leave the reader with a good appreciation of what a porphyric patient must live with daily. It is also a ""Bible"" for those in the health care profession who have little time to become familiar with such different disease. It is invaluable to my staff/colleagues."
2,"Review of ""iMovie 6 & IDVD: The Missing Manual""","iMovie 6 & IDVD: The Missing Manual is not what I consider DavidPogue's best work. It is a bit off the mark, spending a great deal oftime on issues related to camcorders to the detriment of the applications.I would prefer a manual, missing or otherwise, that would apply David'sconsiderable knowledge and communication ability to the topic."
3,iMovie & IDVD: The Missing Manual,"As someone new to computers found this publication well set out and easy to follow.While it didn't answer all my problems it at least pointed me in the right direction, would have no hesitation purchasing future books by the sameauthor."
3,Into the Real World,"This book makes a great graduation gift for the kids who know all there is to know about computers, but haven't learned some of life's basics like writing a decent thank you note, proposing a wedding toast or carving a turkey (a favorite test given by future fathers-in-law to unsuspecting young men). The instructions are humorous, clear and mercifully brief. I think most recipients would appreciate, enjoy and use it."
1,[Poor] Book,"I absolutely hated this book and it's sequel (which, happily, I've forgotten the name to). I can't believe that she turned Elizabeth, possibly the strongest heroine in English literature, into a whiner! Elizabeth of all people - a whiner?!Shame on the author. Reading my kids old ""Goosebumps"" books would have been a much better use of my time. Maybe she should quit trying to improve on perfection and write captions for children's coloring book pages instead."
1,In one word........ HORRIBLE!!!!,"I was excited to find out that there were tons of sequels written to P&P. I knew that none would compare to the original but I still searched to find a way of continuing a link with my most favorite book and its charactors. The first one I read was ""Pemberley"". Let me just be frank with my opinion of it. This horrible sequel does not deserve to have the title ""Pride and Prejudice"" associated with it. The author has ruined my beloved P&P charactors and disgraced Ms Austen by writing such a horrible continuation of her most famous novel. I felt like hurling this book across the room when Miss Tennet depicted Elizabeth as nothing more than an emotional basket case. Lizzy is shown crying at everything. I only gave it 1 star because 0 stars wasn't an option.Please do not read this book and if you have, be consoled in the fact that I too wasted a day of my lfe reading this book and that there are many other more fulfilling P&P sequels out there."
1,HORRIBLE,"The writing style of this adaptation, is not at all like Jane Austen's in P&P. Dark secrets in certain character's pasts are not at all likely to have happened. Elizabeth's character in this novel conflicts with the Elizabeth in P&P. Agitating, and painful to read. The resolution scenes are very short and unsatisfying to the reader. As a book it is tolerable, but as an adaptation is poorly written."
1,If Pride and Prejudice were a soap opera. . .,"this would be the sequel. The characters are shallow, the plot line simplistic and the reading cumbersome. My favorite character Lizzy has become a weak-willed doormat and Darcy is a unlikable clout. I was severely dissappointed and was very glad I borrowed this one from the library so I could GIVE IT BACK. Don't waste your time."
1,Don't Order,I agree completely with aa930 from Florida. This was a horrible book. I only wish that I had read her review of the book before ordering it. I only give it a star at all because I pity the author. I found the likeness of the characters corrupted in description and the distortion in time annoying. I finished the book only out of sheer determination.
1,health warning: for your own sanity DO NOT READ,"Yep I was very bored when I picked this off the library shelf. Instead of watching tennis I thought Id read this instead. What a mistake. The author has written this with the best of intentions but the style does not resemble Austen's, more that of Jilly Cooper or Jackie Collins. While these are competent writers in ther own right, they cannot be compared to Austen. The storyline is incredulous and the ending hard to believe. Lizzy seems to have lost her wit and become plain rude (monstrosities at Pemberley),even Mrs. Bennett would have known not to mention a douche in a public gathering and the ending...well!! I dont recommend any lovers of the original to read this book, I would say use your imagination. You don't need to be told that ""Mr Darcy and Elizabeth kissed and cuddled"" or words to that effect, do you? Read if you dare."
1,Ditto,"...This was one of the worst sequals I've ever read (and that's saying a LOT).If you are a die-hard Jane Austen or P&P fan, and you do not wish to go insane with hate over a book, do not read Pemberly by Emma Tennant."
1,Very badly done,"I think this was a very badly written book and do not recommend it to people who wish to think of Elizabeth and Darcy as they should be thought of. The Characters were nothing like they should be and the plot was very bad. I mean, Lydia was only married maybe a year and she had a bunch of kids? Many parts like that made no sense. This book is in very bad taste."
2,A Risky Read,"Tennant's sequel to Pride and Prejudice does neither the author nor the book justice. It is inaccurate to not only the time, but Austen's style. Tennant ventures into areas of Lizzy and Darcy's lives that Austen would never even dare trespass into. The novel is almost sacreligious. If you're fond of haughty romance novels that have many twists and turns, I would recommend that you read this book. If you are one of those people, like myself, who delights in reading anything Austenesque (I wouldn't bring this into that category), read at your own risk. You may be disappointed."
1,This is an outrage!,"This was a sequel? I found inaccuracies and inconsistencies as early as the second page! How insulting it is to think the author didn't think we'd notice! Did Ms. Tennant even read P&P? Not only were the ages wrong, but the personalities weren't even close to being true to the characters established by its predecessor. I was so frustrated by this book I returned it the next day. This was clearly just an attempt to cash in on the notoriety and reputation of Jane Austen's work."
5,One of my favorites!,I gave this book a try and really enjoyed it. Its one of my favorite sequels to P&P...and to those writing LONG hateful comments about the book..you might want to consider the fact that you don't like reading at all and go back to your sexed up historical romance novels.
1,Laughably bad...,"I saw this book advertised in a catalog and was excited to see a ""sequel"" to P&P. I was seriously disappointed after reading it however, when I discovered that the personalities of most of the characters were changed dramatically (and not for the better). Elizabeth, the heroine of P&P who is a strong and intelligent young woman is reduced to a whiny, wimpy, angst-ridden hand wringer. The cover of the book claims that it is ""authentic and convincing"" as a sequel, but it is simply BAD."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"Thanks to the warning here, I didn't buy the book. A copy was given to me and I was prepared for some bad writing. But I've read some pretty mediocre Jane Austen spinoffs and thought I could stomach it.How wrong I was! It took only a few pages to realize exactly how ridiculously bad the book was. The characters names may have been retained, but nothing else. The chronology is completely messed up. The characters behaved nothing like their Pride and Prejudice selves. The entire book is an exercise in sloppy character assasination, against some of the most beloved characters in all of literature.Truly, Ms. Tennant, have you no shame?"
2,"A meandering, pointless book","I listened to Pemberley on cassette while sick, which is mostly the reason I had a somewhat favourable opinion of it to begin with. But after some thought - it's horrible! The bad continuity of this book has already been mentioned but I could forgive Emma Tenant if her greatest errors were in the ages of Lydia and Georgiana. The characterization, for lack of a better word, stinks! The plot...what plot? Oh, *that* thing! Completely pointless and at times embarrasing. The fan fiction written by Jane Austen fans is much, much better than this *stuff* I only given it two stars because of my innicial good impression."
1,Do NOT Read this book,"Having read Presumption (another sequel to Pride and Prejudice), by Julia Barret, I started this book with high hopes. I was sorely disappointed. This book is a poor imitation of Presumption with some of the same story ideas (the relationship between Darcy and Elizabetand its effect on Georgianna, the close proximity of Mrs. Bingley, the daunting first party to be held at Pemberley, and Darcy's fond regard for the Gardiners, for example.) It takes off in wild directions however, when it allows Jane Austin's well-crafted characters to act in decidedly anti-Austin ways. This book puts Elizabeth, in particular, in situtions with which Austin would hardly be happy. (See page 79 and the gypsy caravan for the most exasperating example.) The ending is decidedly awkward considering the timeframe of the story. All in all, I do not recommend this book. If you MUST HAVE another Jane Austin and/or find out what happened after the wedding, read Presumption. It is 100 times better."
1,Oh my god.... so bad...ha ha,"okay, apparently authors think that the best fanfics have Elizabeth barren and an illegitamate child must find their way into the plot too. Actually Elizabeth's inability to concieve is 75% of the composition of this TERRIBLE book. I don't think the author read Pride and Prejudice and the only reason I can find for its publication is that she claims a vague descension from Jane Austen's brother. THE END."
1,Absolutely ridiculous,What?!? Jane Austen would be horrified by what Emma Tennant has made our dear Elizabeth into with this book! Poor Mr. Darcy is nothing but an afterthought. And AS IF sweet Mr. Bingley of all people would have a sordid past! Absolutely ridiculous.
2,review,"This book is the first p&p sequel I have ever read, and I was disapointed because of some of the contridicting between the original novel and Pemberley. I thought some of the original characters were a bit melodramatic compared to Jane Austens version, but it does have some good parts which are relivant for a sequel to have! I would like to add how hard it is to capture these characters (who are complex) and that it does need some editing on certain aspects to be considered really good but in the mean time its OKAY!"
2,Boring,"I don't remember the original book being dull. In fact, something new is happening on ever other page. Not so with this book. Elizabeth is insecure and uninteresting. I don't think anyone would enjoy this book."
1,"Bad, REally BAD","ET has made many errors while writing this book such as the ages of georgiana, and the impossible number of lydia's children. i won't go into depth, since so many of you have already done that. Elizabeth in this book is a worrywart, and Bingley has a DArk past involving a ""frenchwoman"" and an illegitimate son. Besides, when was Darcy ever a spy during the Napoleonic wars?! Georgiana is a complete brat and is Caroline Bingley's puppet. Darcy continually keeps secrets from Elizabeth, which puts her into jealous frenzies. I thought that the marriage of elizabeth and darcy was a happy one, yet how cant they possibly get along if they don't know how to communicate? Elizabeth's character in this book completely contradicts JA's Elizabeth in P&P.... This book isn't worth your time, and it completely ruins your image of p&P. and if you are going to buy it, don't buy it hardcover!"
2,An unworthy sequel,"Another strange P&P; sequel. Other reviews already point out the numerous inconsistencies, so I'm not going to outline all of them. I don't have P&P; memorized, but even I could use common sense and deduce that this book doesn't really follow P&P; it's kind of like the sequel to a different P&P; in a parellel universe.The characters are all completely different, and it is obvious that the author did not research the time period, as anachronisms abound.There are several great P&P; sequels; don't waste your time on this one."
1,A Stunning Disappointment,I only wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this book. This is what I get for not shopping online!
1,Horrid - Horrid -- Horrid,"JA is spinning in her grave --Not only is the timeline COMPLETELY blown, the character of Elizabeth Bennett Darcy has been undone in this sad excuse for a novel.The author reduces EBD to a fragile, confused, judgemental, withering child. The author also makes a joke out of the Darcy's marriage and attacks Mr Bingley's character.Then we are introduced to ANOTHER ENTALE.....Please -- talk about a waste of time....I kept reading to see how bad it got -- got very, very bad... not even a good ending..RMG"
1,Skip it - an immense disappointment,"If you are a Jane Austen fan, you'll find this book disappointing. Behind its pleasant packaging is a 2nd-rate narrative that borrows characters, but doesn't fulfill the reader's expectations.Elizabeth has been transformed into a simple worrywort who can't connect with her husband. Darcy doesn't have much personality at all. Mrs. Bennett is made more likeable, but the humor and wit of the real _Pride and Prejudice_ is lacking.All the characters have developed a smallness of mind that is a reflection of a good story in the hands of an incapable storyteller. The entire narrative is imbued with a negativity that Austen fans will find tiresome and juvenile. Re-read the original and skip this one."
1,Stay Away from this one,"I've read several Austen sequels/completion, and this is hands down the very worst one. I purchased it along with ""Presumption"" by Julia Barret, and while that book was not perfect, it was at least entertaining and half-way true to the original story, something that ""Pemberley"" was not. ""Pemberley"" is an inaccurate, confused medley of relationships and events that make no sense in either the relation to the original book or in themselves. It's very simply a badly done soap opera with the 'Austen continuation!' tag on it to lure readers in. Unless you wish to waste your money, stay away."
1,Don't Buy This Book!!!!!!!!,I wish someone would have warned me about this book before I wasted the money. How could every (completely out of character)horrible thing Mr. Darcy did to Elizabeth in this story be resolved in three sentences without any explanation? What a waste. Please do not buy this book!
1,Where was the editor?,"The major inaccuracies are the easiest parts of this book to loathe. Its faithlessness to EB's spirit is frustrating. Probably the worst PnP spinoff I've read (worse than Desire and Duty). My favorite part was that the author claimed to be a descendant of Austen, which is why I suppose she could forego actually reading Pride and Prejudice. She just channeled it, apparently. Badly. I wanted to choose zero stars, but couldn't."
5,Robin Williams: Inside Actors Studio,This is a fantastic video that any fan of Robin Williams needs to own!! Very informative about the man and what makes him so funny.
5,"Robin Williams, really being Him self.",Robin Williams: Inside Actors StudioThis DVD would make a great gift to give to anyone of any age.
4,Can't expect the normal routine,"Whenever Robin Williams is on a talk show or doing an interview, don't expect the normal routine. Williams goes off on so many tangents that it could drive the interviewer crazy!On ""Inside the Actors Studio"" Robin Williams does not hold anything back. James Lipton had trouble asking him 3 questions in the span of 30 minutes. For a lot of people, this would be a bad thing, as they would start to get annoying. However, this is what Robin Williams does best. He is hilarious when nothing is scripted.If you are a fan of the Robin Williams style of comedy, you should enjoy this interview."
5,With Robin Williams...It's not your regular interview.,"I just recently saw Robin Williams in concert back in October. It was so much fun! Ever since then, I've been seeing a lot of his movies on cable. I've seen this interview before on the Bravo network on cable. I never knew it was on DVD. When Robin Williams is being interviewed, you know you will not be bored. He had the audience in the theater laughing almost the entire time. It's fun to hear his side when he's talking about his family, the movies he's made, his life growing up, the schooling he had before he went into the entertaiment buisness. During the interview, he does a lot of stand-up. It keeps the inverview fun. The man is a comic genius!! It's funny to know when he was in high school he was voted ""funniest person,"" but also voted ""least likely to succeed."" So much they know! Ha! I would recomend this dvd to anyone who is a Robin Williams fan, or even if you're not. If you want a good laugh, he will keep you in stitches!"
4,"Amazing footage, needs to be 3 hours longer","This was an amazing interview, and the small amount of extras they showed were fantastic. However, they admit that they took 5 hours of Robin Williams, and condensed it into 2.5 hours for this dvd. I want my other 2.5-3 hours of Robin. Amazingly, they also cut out the part I remember seeing on tv, where Robin talks about his friendship with Christopher Reeve. This was very strange.Overall, it was excellent, hence 4 out of 5 stars. If they come out with an extended version, buy that one instead."
4,Fascinating interview; Robin is always interesting and fun!,"One part of the interview which stands out for me, is when Robin took a scarf from a female audience member, and used it as a prop to make many hilarious examples of his amazingly quick improvisational talent. Known for his lightning fast wit, he still surprised my family with how many different examples he could come up with, for how the scarf could be used to make so many jokes. Robin's talent *was* the interview, not answering many questions; although he did answer as many as he could before he had to give in to the lure of having an audience ready & willing to enjoy his humor!James Lipton knew going in that he was going to have a challenge keeping Robin answering questions, lol! But Robin did show the process of how he used & utilized his talent, and it was a highly entertaining and interesting interview which I will never forget."
4,I've been waiting for this,I love the entire series but I think that this may be one of the crowning moments. There are a lot of great interviews but Robin Williams steals the show and really lets us know why he's one of the greatest comedic performers today. If you don't like to laugh don't watch this. I was laughing out loud the entire time since Robin Williams took the stage. If you don't like this episode it's a simple fact that you don't like Robin Williams' comedy. This is a must see for anyone that loves hilarious improv. I'm definitely getting this.
4,Good as ever,"I agree with all the other reviews. It is a darn good book for a sequel. The last chapter however, leaves the question open of Sealink's tail. Was it ever healed back to it's fluffy state? Surley this could be done by the ""healing"" cats. Also the author should know better that to give any dog chocolate - real or in a story."
3,Enjoyable read,"Being a fan of cats and fantasy and books like ""Watership Down,"" I bought this novel at a book sale without knowing much about it. I was not disappointed. It's an enjoyable read that creates a fascinating feline world. My main gripe concerns the many subplots. The book alternates between several plot threads concerning the adventures of different characters. After going back to where I left off, I often had to reread the preceding section just to recall what was going on. Character development and background about the characters were also a bit lacking. Perhaps this is a problem to be resolved by reading the prequel, ""The Wild Roads."""
2,The horror,"I couldn't wait to finish reading this book because I desperately wanted it to be over. The horrific and vivid descriptions of violence against felines was overwhelming... not to mention just too frequent. Sometimes it felt like there were different writers penning different chapters. The style seemed to change frequently, and when the story began the characters had slightly different personalities from the first book, THE WILD ROAD, which I liked much better (even though the climax and resolution lacked in that one.) I especially missed Tag in this book. We barely spend any time with him at all. But if you're in it for descriptive passages King gives that in spades."
2,good story,"This series about The Golden Cat is a little hard to understand sometimes because of the fantasy ""road"" the cats ""travel"". It does make for an interestering read, however!"
4,Great video and great gift,This is a great series and the production is pretty cool as well. It is filmed by Les Stroud and he is on his own most of the time so he is the crew and the teacher all while he is trying to survive for 7 days on his own.this is a great gift for the outdoor types.
5,Survivormen Turn Forward!,"Me and my friends, X and Ken, have watched every episode of Survivorman. We wanted to be Survivorman so much that we formed a club called Survivormen. We are now climbing the 10 highest peaks in the Catskill Mountains. So far, we have climbed the top six peaks. We don't make a fire with our hands, eat worms and grasshoppers, or build a shelter with twigs and leaves. But Les is our inspiration. So when we reach the top of each mountain, we toast him and ourselves with Bailey's Irish Cream, eat beef jerky and candy bars, and find a stone to keep as a remembrance. Then we climb down and go to the same restaurant where we eat like Baptists and get drunk. We are following in Survivorman's footsteps, more or Les."
3,Not as good as before,"This season has gotten pretty weak. He brought a tent and a sleeping back on one ""survival"" trek. If you're looking for hardcore ideas and understanding about surviving in the wild Survivor man, and I say this with a heavy heart because the first seasons were great, is no longer for you."
5,LIVE!,"The jams on this video were great. I must admit that the crowd was kind of quiet. I reccommend Hezzie to do another recording in front of a Toronto audience. The video represented to the fullest, it showed Hezzie and all of the Love Fellowship Ministries can get down both live and on studio tracks. This is recommended for a collectable."
3,Half and HAlf,"I own this video and enjoyed ""parts"" of it very much. The quality of sight and sound was very good. However, the audience was VERY bad. I meand if they didn't enjoy it sitting right there why would I enjoy it on video. Oh, and yes I agree with the statement someone else said. At the beginning of the video he says one thing and at the end of the video he's ""giggin'"" with a secular artist. Let's get real, or should I say honest with ourselves."
2,A little disappointed.,"I a viewed the family affair video and was a little dissappointed. The songs were good on the most part and the tecnical quality was excellent but the way it was put together was no so hot. The first song ""the meledy"" was empty. It looked like the band was just testing their instruments. The audience was just sitting there not even getting involved. The introduction to the song ""I Got a Reason"" was not needed. On one hand Hezekiah Walker talks about how much he loves the old way of singning and dancing and then at the end of the video he puts ""Let's Dance"" which was done with a secular artist. I was a little confused. Although I did enjoy the video ""Let's Dance"" it was very well put together. I also enjoyed ""I Got a Reason"" despite the long intro. But my favorite song was ""Patiently Waiting"", featuirng the Celebration Choir."
4,Does what it's suppose to do,"Easy to use and understand. Very basic piece of equipment, but priced quite high for what it is. I assume most the cost must be in the calibrated spring. I wish the legend would have been more complete. It skips numbers and tension values, leaving it to the user to do the math for the unlisted values."
1,How did this get past the publisher?,"I bought this book because it came recommended by the store. It had promise in the first few pages. The author does provide a detailed backround for her plot. However the characters are flimsy & cliche. The writing gets very choppy & leaps all over the place. By page 309 (Where I stopped)they had kissed twice, fought about her *maybe* being a witch & then argued about their anulment 100 times. Enough with the tension & agnst already! This is supposed to be a romance after all! This book had no flow, no imagination & was just about the single most irritating thing I have ever read. I'm taking it back for a refund tommorow."
3,It was ok,"I think that the book started off really nicely, but it was just so focused on the facts that I couldn't really focus on the actual story part of the book! I wish that I could have gotten a chance to enjoy the characters more, instead of having to focus so much on the history. To much time was focused on the history. It did have a fun story line though. I don't think I will read it again though."
4,I loved it!!!,"Having read the other reviews on this book i felt compelled to offer my own opinion. Firstly, living in Australia i got the book until the title The Silver Bride which actually comes with a much classier cover than the one on this site. And because of this I didn't actually realise that it was meant to be a romance book, but I must say having read as just a book I throughly enjoyed it.Although it may be true that you lose some of Heloise's spark as it gets further through the book I still enjoyed the elements of romance and the historical elements of the book, and I think that if you don't actually read it as a romance book but rather as a book that is historically intersting with some romance thrown in then you will love it like I do. It is actually a very clever and interesting book, and i must say to the other reviewer you should have read the last 50 pages because Heloise's ""spark"" does come back.This book is now one of my favourite books :)"
1,This book is nothing but made up stories,"This book is nothing but a collection of made up stories by hunters trying to feel more manly about shooting bears. I live in Alaska and spent the summer camping with brown bears in Katmai National Park. I can say from experience that everything in this book is myth, grotesque fantasy, made up nonsense and lore. These types of book feed the false stereotype that bears are man eaters, which they are not. For example, hundreds of tourists a day walk with bears in Katmai National Park. The only fatal bear attack in Katmai, since it was opened in the 1920's, was Timothy Treadwell - and he was mentally ill. When bears are treated without violence, they are peaceful. This book is nothing more than propaganda by the hunting establishment. If people knew that children and the elderly walk safely with bears every summer, it would seem really pathetic to go out and shoot them. Read Grizzly Heart by Charlie Russell if you want to read a book about real bears."
4,Great ethnography about a very facinating people.,"William and his wife Jean are very successful in executing a both interesting and seemingly accurate investigation of the Canela. Like Chagnon's book Yanomamo, but less harmful,Crocker's, The Canela keeps the reader reading. The introduction sets the scene well and the historical context chapter is helpful in understanding the tribe and its origin. The following chapters on bonding through kinship, ritual and sex are easily understood. I also enjoyed the epilogue which answered a few of my questions on the Canelas current state. All in all, a successful ethnography."
3,Interesting topic,"While I found this book fascinating overall, the writing was rather dry. At times the ethnographer's naivety and bias are somewhat disturbing, but he is ultimately successful in conveying a vivid picture of the Canela. I would recommend this book soley because the topic is very interesting and offers an interesting cross-cultural study."
4,Not compatable with DIRECTV,"If you have DIRECTV don't buy this set. The picture is OK, not great.DIRECTV does not have a code for the remote so you can't adjust the volume using the DIRECTV remote. If you don't mind using two remotes then it's a good buy. I'm sending it back."
1,This movie has it all,"This movie has it all.Bad acting, silly and implausible plot. I mean, Come on!. The good guys go after the drug-lord types and steal ""the secret laptop"". The drug lords learn who's attacking them. The good guys hang out the entire time in a restaurant they own and the bad guys never bother to go after them.The female lead apparently got her two expressions (pissed and majorly pissed) from Clint Eastwood. Dan Lauria (the bad cop) was amusing in a sad sort of way and Stephen Macht (who should have quit acting when he finished ""Galaxina"") played an evil government type who was after the female lead for some reason or another.At least it was better than ""In the Bedroom"""
2,Poorly Made Film with Very Few Bright Spots,"I'm a sucker for martial arts films...I watch them and I'm rarely satisfied. Normally, I can expect to be somewhat entertianed by a Rothrock film, even if it is just watching her kick some butt. This movie, however, has very little butt kicking and a lot of bad acting and direction. This 90 minute film feels like it is two hours long. It has been a long time since Rothrock has done anything worth watching...but I watch her next video anyway, hoping for the glory days of ""Righting Wrongs"" and ""Dragon Lady."""
1,"This movie isn't all good to me, there are better of Cynthia Rothrock!","I couldn't agree more, I think this movie should have more butt kicking then action. It really bites, but I guess I'll go with other movies that Rothrock has been in."
4,"Very good product, but bulky for a Macbook","I have had no problems with this card reader using a 4GB Kingston SDHC Memory card (Kingston 4 GB SDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card SD4/4GB), but I do find that it's a little bulky when used in either a 13"" white or aluminum Macbook, as plugging it in to either of the USB ports blocks the use of the other one. Since I use an external mouse, this is quite frustrating, and I've taken to using a 4-port USB hub just for this product. Otherwise it's fine, though."
5,"Great, fast","Works great with SD and SDHC cards, and is very fast. Very nice when paired with high-end SDHC card for ultimate speed."
2,Worked fine until...,"Loved the idea of such a useful tool in a compact package. Worked fine for a while until apparently a prong in the SD slot got bent and, not sure how, but created serious errors on two of my 2Gb cards. Think I'll try a different reader next time."
4,"Works fine, instructions stink.","I have sd, minisd, and microsd cards and was looking for a compact reader the size of a thumb drive. I lost the adapter to the minisd card and most readers require sd adapters. mini, micro and regular sd cards can be used without adapters with this. instruction manual is confusing about which way the cards should face when inserted (facing up or facing down). microsd faces the opposite of minisd with the logos facing outwards.I was hoping I could use this as a keychain but some genius at Sandisk put the strap connector on the cap which wouldn't be able to support the weight of the reader."
3,Sandisk Mobile Mate,"Cannot really rate as it does not handle my cards, so have not used. I guess I should have returned, but figure I will end up needing it at some point...will see. Suppose to interface with three cards, all of which I do not use. I know, sounds dim."
1,Stopped working,"I have had this card reader for some time now and loved it at first. But then it stopped reading cards. It was a hit or miss for a little bit, then stopped working completely. I now have to invest in another one. I will not buy this product again."
5,Works great,"My computer has a SD card slot, but it won't read SDHC cards, so I got this little device and it works great!I have a video on my memory card that I've been trying to get off through my camera, but it wont download. I download the video clips through the stick and it worked!Great product for the price."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is very hand and easy to use no fuss, muss or whatever. pop your card in and pop stick into your pc and VIOLA access to your stuff. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Very Useful Device,"I bought this in order to transfer photos from my PC to an SD card that is used in a Smartparts picture frame---instead of connecting the picture frame directly to the PC. I find it easier to do this way. The MobileMate is fast, works well, and is very convenient."
3,"Good, but ....","This card reader can read SD, SDHC and microSD (two different slots), the price is right and Sandisk tech support is easy to reach. However, my unit would NOT read any SD or SDHC disk I had UNTIL I figured out with Sandisk tech support, that you CANNOT push the disk in all the way until it is seated. You can only push it in until the LED light comes on and if you push past that point, the card's contacts will go past the reader's contacts and the connection is lost. The most annoying thing is that there is no detente or click or anything, you just have to ""play with it a little"" to get good contact. The microSD reader slot works fine however if you push the card all the way in.Sandisk acknowledges a design issue with the card reader and said they talked to their engineers about changing it. I probably won't bother to return as it does work, but this is not what I expected."
4,Buying a name brand makes a difference,"I was having constant problems with my computer (an iMac) reading & writing files to my SD cards. After several frustrating hours alone and with Apple tech support, the tech finally asked me, ""What brand of card reader are you using?"" I had bought it at WalMart - it was so cheap it didn't even have a brand on it.So I bought the Sandisk one, which cost a little more, and it works perfectly. So my advice is to spend the extra few buck and go with a brand name - Sandisk, for example."
1,Wrong one,I got this for a Hewlett-Packard camera chip. Oops-wrong reader! Anybody need this thing? I can't use it.
3,Does not work all the time with MacBook,"I have had on and off luck using this with my SD card and can not seem to have it read my mini SD Card on my MacBook. I find that I would have to remove it and re-plug it in to hope that iPhoto reads it. I have to do it about 3-4 times for all the pictures to upload or for iPhoto to recognize it's format? It any event, not completely happy with this purchase."
2,"Good if/while it works, bad when it breaks...","It's a nice form factor, and worked fine /when/ it worked. One day pulled it back out of the drawer and it would read 'normal' sd cards, but not sdhc cards. Went to Sandisk support - which requires back and forth via a web site (can't do e-mail) and trying to get an RMA was like pulling teeth. I finally decided it would be easier to buy a new reader. I bought a Kingston MobileLite and it required no more hassle and is working /much/ better (8.3MB/sec on a low price sdhc card). I've bought Sandisk products for years - and most have worked well, but this support experience convinced me to go with other brands."
3,"Works good, but Sandisk website SUCKS for returns","I had this for about 6 months before it started causing errors on my SD card.I tried going through the Sandisk website for a return, but their site asked for the most useless information, did not work, and would not let me submit a replacement request without giving me the same error.I am never buying another Sandisk reader, going with IOGear or someone else!"
3,Mobilemate is a temperamental,"I got this to read my 8gb SDHC card. I plugged it into my Dell laptop and the results were poor. I got errors, corrupted directory messages, etc. after a few files transferred over. I plugged it into a USB port on my desktop and it works fine there... So, mixed reviews on that.Also, you'd think by now that mfrs would figure out how to solve the problem of the Cap. The cap pops off way too easily. and to make it worse, Sandisk put the lanyard loop on the cap, so you can lose the main unit even easier. sheeesThe cap does snap onto the bottom, but of course then the cap covers up the led activity light.Whoever engineered this was obviously a foreign exchange student or a college temp."
4,Memory Gear,"A decent product, works well and easy to use from a known gear maker. A neccessity these days."
1,Not good,"I have used several of these devices for other formats from Sandisk with no issues. I use the memory stick version all the time. I bought this to take on trips to offload pics from my camera. It worked once with my Sandisk SDHC card, and never again. It recognized the card once. It would also not recognize a standard Sandisk SD card after that first use. Don't waste your money."
1,Didn't work for me,I ordered this to work with a new Kingston 4gb SDHC card on my Mac running Leopard. I thought the first one was defective and sent it back (after SanDisk tech support told me to do so). Got the replacement from Amazon and had the same problem. Was the second one defective also? hmmmm...
4,Works Great,"Fine product; workds great and transfers data lickity split.I'm not a fan of the cap though; one star deducted. It's a loose piece that attaches with friction retention on a plastic piece that I suspect will eventually wear out. Plus, the keychain loop is on this cap. If you want to put this on a keychain or lanyard I wouldn't trust it; the reader will probably fall out of the cap and you'd never notice it. When you go to get your reader you'll only see the cap on your chain."
5,MADE WELL!!!,"I have had a plastic and a thin metal flag since being in my home for 5 years. This one is so well made that I think the mailbox will go before it does. A little difficult for me to pull up when in the car due to shape, but that is not a major problem. It also stands up high so I can see from the house if the mail has come or not. Very pleased!!!"
1,Terrible art that does not match the story,"This is some phoned in art work.I found the art so bad that I could hardly read the text. After this many years you think Silvestri would improve his art style but you'd be wrong, he has regressed. It seems as if he couldn't complete the required number of pages for the script, squished it down and just sped through the ones he did turn in so they wouldn't be returnable.I think they teach you to drop cross hatching as a shading technique when you are in High School art classes but here it reigns supreme.Poor work from someone that should be better but rather representative of his current shoddy style."
1,Time Mix Up Mess,"I'm a long time fan of the X-Men and I have to admit that this is the worst story line they have ever had. Sure, it had a few high points but for the most part it's a huge confusing mess. That's because the plot was allowed to wander all over the place with no clear direction. It seems like it was written on the fly with a sort of ""let's do this"" attitude. Don't waste your money on it."
2,"REALLY wanted to like this, BUT...","I don't necessarily disagree with other reviewers here than this collection expands on, and brings closure to, the excellent themes and ideas Morrison had been developing since his start on New X-Men, but I can't help but feeling robbed by the ""Imaginary/Alternate Universe"" angle, which I feel is a cop-out. There's no integrity, no ownership, no responsibility for anything as soon as you say ""It's an alternate timeline."" You can do anything you like with no repercussions. Characters can have sensational and meaningless deaths, future connections that have no bearing on current events can be made, etc, etc, etc. I just feel a little cheated, is all. Sorry, Grant!"
3,well...,"This is not one of my favorite books. From the first few wandering poems, she doesn't seem like a poet of noteworthy vision. There are places in the book where the thinking is very interesting & the thoughts are indeed rewarding for the reader, but most of the poetry here is not wonderful. I do so much work to find interesting thoughts within these poems...& I read so little great merit of hers that's easy to find...that I'm not even sure how much of the reward I get from reading the book is self-generated. I mean you can find interesting thoughts anywhere in you're trying that hard. In any case, it is interesting to read the work of younger poets such as Szporluck to get a glimpse of the poetry of her generation. & it's not a TERRIBLE book. I just don't know how much of a career as a poet she has ahead of her."
2,petty,"She forces herself into stylistic extremes to make up for having nothing really to say. Basically all she said in this whole book that was almost interesting to me was that blood is water reddened by desire, & even that isn't so exciting. There are so many modern poets whose writing is far better, for instance such young modernists as Karen Volkman, Brenda Shaughnessy, Robyn Schiff, Joanna Goodman, & many, many others. Unlike Larissa Szporluck, they really say things & do things with their work."
5,HOT!,"This album is going to blow up the spot like nobody knows. i was in my local store 'D's Joint' and heard it playing.The song 'real man' was on, i knew then i wanted the album. i bought it straight away and as i expected i wasn't disappointed. With its phat beats. Some of which you'd expect from timbalands music factory. All i can say is GET IT NOW, YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED."
5,TALK SHOW SHHH IS THE GHETTO ANTHEM,SHAE JONES IS DA BOMB HER CD IS OFF THE HOOK. SHE CAN REALLY MAKE A SONG BOUT IT. IT'S TIGHT HOW SHE BUSTS OUT AND BLOWS UP FILTY TRACKS LIKE BAD BAY. SHE HAS MEMORABLE FUNNY INTELUDES. HER LYRICS ARE VERY FOR REAL.
4,I HAD TO HAVE IT,"I HEARD A FRIEND'S COPY OF THIS CD. I TOLD HER I HAD TO GO GET MY OWN. I BOUGHT IT AND SOMEONE STOLE IT, SO I WENT AND BOUGHT IT AGAIN ,I HAD TO HAVE IT AGAIN. I LOVE EVERYTIME AND SYMPTOMS OF A HEARTBREAK, THOSE ARE MY FAVORITES. I LOVE THE WHOLE CD. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD CD TO BUY, PLEASE PICK THIS ONE. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. SHAE'S VOICE AND THE BEATS SOUND GOOD."
4,An account of rural life in WV just prior to statehood,"I had always heard of this book growing up in Harrison County. It took place in and around my home so I was familiar with all the locations even though some place names have changed. As we celebrate the 150th birthday of WV this year, it is interesting to read what life was like at the time. The language is a bit flowery but it adds to the overall sense of period. It is a quick read drawing the reader into the mystery of it. Charming!"
3,Ghoulish Director...Still Not Impressed,"This is a very ghoulish move and the director broke taboo after taboo after taboo but could not produce any theartrical value. So we got to see real footage of animals being brutishly tortured, so what the director got to depict the murder and violence against babies and childrem; so what we now know what it is like to really witness a hammer attack against a tied up women beginning to end....was that all that Bol wanted? Was this just taboo breaking oppurtunism without giving us plot twists, and exciting characters, interesting settings, complicated symbols. The director just wanted to excercise foul hood and the value was very thin. Watching a documentary about serial killers gives more value. There just wasn`t enough cinematic matter here to justify the crimes against humanity depicted here. 3 stars for stepping out of the normal taboos but that is all it was really good for."
3,seed,"There is only one long real gross scene in this horror film. It was graphic and disturbing, but that was all. The other deaths were nothing new. It's an Uwe Boll film which i did not know about until it was too late and i already paid for the film.. lucky for me i only paid 2 bucks for it. I know Uwo Boll is a crappy at making films but this one was ok. I can't bost about it but i thought there were good moments. I liked the ending and the plot was good. I didn't see no girl with a red dress in the film so i dunno why she's on the cover art and i didn't get a copy of the game so other than those two things,it was another b rated horror film."
2,what the hell is this,i can not believe that this is not banned. i watched and own plenty of horror movies but in this film what you see is what you get. a lot of real brutal scenes that they used in this movie. yes the movie has a plot. but it is a bloody nasty film.at the beginning they slam real dogs to the ground. and they step on them . blood blood blood.real animal torture are in this movie.
1,Very Creepy!!!,"I watched this last night around 4:00 a.m. in the morning. Some parts were really creepy and gory. I hated the beginning when they show dogs being tortured. The middle was pretty cool. The Seed character reminded me of Rob Zombie's Michael Myers. I didn't like the baby being tortured. I love horror movies, but I draw the line with animals and babies. Another thing I didn't like was the extremely depressing ending I would compare it to The Mist's ending. I couldn't believe it! If you love horror, don't watch SEED!!!"
1,Utter Garbage.,"My name is Raul Valdez and im using my moms account. You can say all you want about me, and call me a hypocrite for loving movies like Apocalypse now, The Thing, Exorcist, Exorcist 3, which are movies that have violence, and even animal cruelty. I couldnt care less. This movie is pure garbage. I wouldnt give this to someone I disliked. Its not only overly gorey, but unrealistic. Oh yeah an unarmed man takes out a bunch of cops, waltches into prison, and servives his brains being boiled. So is this supernatural or based in reality? Sure Apocalyse Now had some animal cruelty but i dont remmeber it having sick crap every other second. This movie goes in the trash heap just like my copy went."
4,Good stuff and bad stuff!,"I hate writing reviews on sub-par movies, but in this case I had to! I gave it 4 stars because it had some real good cringe factor scenes, plus several other scenes that were much better than one would expect. However, Michael Pare pretty much sucked in this movie. I like him, he is a good actor if the writers and director let him ""do his thing"". They didn't in this flick. Pare could have brought this movie way up, if they would have let him be the same type character he was in ""Streets Of Fire"". But no, instead he is a whiner, and pussy through out. He is portrayed as a sensitive liberal ( I don't want to hurt anybody} police detective. This attitude manages to get everybody he loves or even likes killed . I just feel it all could have been better if Pare was more of a kick ass cop. The ending was different, not sure how I feel about it, except Pare pretty much got what he deserved. This movie is worth a watch, some good stuff in it, could have been alot better."
3,Better Tune Up That Electric Chair...,"I was skeptical about this film for two reasons: 1- It's an Uwe Boll movie. 2- All three of the raves on the DVD box are from the same source. Well, I watched it and, um..., didn't absolutely hate it! It does lose a star for the (very real and extremely graphic) animal torture / killing footage at the beginning. I suppose its inclusion had something to do w/ SEED's internal darkness, but it could have been better used in a movie about animal abuse! Anyway, as horror movies go, SEED is only so-so. As a Uwe Boll movie, it's magnificent! Yes, it does tend to drag on in places, and there's that eternal, CGI-heavy, head-pulverizing sequence, but otherwise, SEED is actually OK. I was surprised at just how much I didn't despise SEED! It's even moved me to watch Boll's RAMPAGE! A miracle!..."
4,speechless,I have always enjoyed horror movies. They are usually far fetched and kind of fun.SEED however is not fun. This has to be the most shocking and disturbing movie I have ever seen....It displays the most cruel and violent things that you could imagine.
5,Linehand,"LINEHAND is author Clay Brown's first novel. It is fun and very readable. It is an uplifting piece of work without bad language to wade through. Well written and with lots of real learning with regard to the life of a LINEHAND. As I read this book, I was enlightened about many things I had no idea became a part of a person's life on the road to becoming a LINEHAND. I always enjoy reading an engaging novel and learning something new at the same time."
5,"Funny, sexy, entertaining book!","Donna Kaufmann knows how to write funny, sexy and entertaining books. Loved the story. High recommend. The heroine Valerie is a little frazzled and the hero Jack is just the man to settle her down. Love the friendship between Jack and Eric too!"
5,Superb unit...,"This is the second PAL that I've purchased. I have been overwhelmed by the quality of these units, as well as the remarkable sound! I have used it both as a radio, and as a transmitter for an iPod. In addition, I have used an Apple Airport Express unit to broadcast streaming internet audio. It has performed wonderfully.I have owned the first unit for over a year, with NO problems. I am very critical when it comes to sound quality, and this radio ROCKS!"
1,not a good monitor,"This monitor has a tendency to pick up interference from different appliances being used in the house. Fans, lights etc. Our big screen tv renders the product useless -it just puts out static. The voice activated feature pops when used, very annoying. We ended up disabling that feature (and that was the very reason we bought this model). Extremely disappointed with this product."
1,Don't buy it,I wanted this monitor because I could use batteries in both baby & parent monitors and the price seemes right for $20 so I ordered it and tried it out the first night and all I heard was static & silence. It never picked up my baby's cries. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Very sensitive,"I found these monitors so sensitive, they picked up sounds from the daycare 1/2 mile away! Switching channels did the trick. They work good and are sensitive enough to hear breathing."
2,"It works well 3 firts months ..,.later so so",Really it works well three months but later it works with several noises and interferences.. I think it reduce power and sound are trasmited weak.. Really it is better to pay more for other product.
4,T.H. marine trim control,bought the trim control because of failure of 3 different trim control switches on Teleflex throttle and trim control for boat. Much sturdier switches compared to Teleflex junk. Only problem is a very stiff and heavy coiled cord. Could be more flexible. Gary
5,"Feels, looks great","I ordered this pen for my husband not realizing the blue is slightly marbled and a little bright rather than dark navy. After many months of it sitting around, I finally put it in my purse to use. I have enjoyed it ever since.The pen is nice to hold although I usually prefer a more slender space pen. It does look special esp with the gold appointments. It writes smoothly every time. I do think the right man could use this pen making it somewhat unisex. My guy is more into dark colors so now I get the benefits.I wish it had a protective sleeve to keep it in for the times it falls out of my pen pocket in my bag. That's the only drawback. (And the manufacturer's packaging is not that impressive to me for the price and Waterman name.)"
4,Good Looking Pen,"In the past, I have viewed Waterman Pens as quality and character for a decent price. This pen has the fit and finish I have come to expect, and I am delighted with my purchase. These marble pens in various colors are always quite impressive."
2,Bodhran,"I bought this based on other reviews but when I received it, I was disappointed in the sound. It might make a fine prop for a cub scout fire circle but as an Irish hand drum, it falls flat. I expected a low flat sound associated with this type of drum but it has a very high sound.It takes a lot of hand work to make this playable. Next time, I'll buy one Ican play first. Like all handmade instruments, they vary. My advice, try first buy second."
3,"Ok drum, dissapointed with two details.","It's an ok drum, especially for the price. However, the drum pictured has a decorative band where the skin meets the wood. The drum I was sent did not. I also did not care for the fact that this ""Irish"" bodran came with a little label saying ""Made in Pakistan"". I knew that with a low price, it was probably going to be made in one of the numerous countries that undervalues its workers. But, I would have preferred to have known this upfront before purchasing it, and would have paid more money for a drum made in the USA or Europe."
2,Not very insightful.,"The positives:- I appreciated the quotes from first hand interviews with Gen Yers- May be helpful to someone who is completely unaware of the ""Gen Y"" conceptThe negatives:- To be honest, I haven't finished this book yet (several months on I'm only on page 151/188 of text), and it is on a topic I am quite interested in.- It seemed to state the obvious (commonly held beliefs/feelings of Gen Yers), but didn't give me what I was looking for (information on how to interact with older generations - namely the Boomers), especially in a workplace setting.- this book is focused on Gen Y in Australia, which is similar to North American culture, but uses some different terminology, and has a few different issues for Gen Y; as a North American reader, I didn't enjoy it."
2,Less Pop More Fizz,"I like iconoclastic risktaking filmmaking as much as the next guy. That said I didn't cozy to ""The Coca-Cola Kid"". It seems like it tried too hard to be offbeat, selfconsiously so, that it never really caught fire. Definitely a case of an askewed sensibility over any real substance. It doesn't help matters that Eric Roberts' character, a whiz kid from the head office in Atlanta, grates on you. I've liked Roberts in other endeavors(see ""Runaway Train"") but he doesn't seem to get a handle on this one. One of the film's few redeeming qualities is the turn by Greta Scacchi as a wily secretary for Coke's Aussie headquarters. She is sexy, coquettish, and hilarious in turns. Alas, she can't make us believe that she's head-over-heels for Roberts' character. Another reason for pause is a scene where Scacchi showers nude with her on-screen daughter. Some may find this sensual I thought it exploitative and redundant. Regardless, this one is a definite misfire."
3,Entertaining,This little known movie is fairly well produced and has good cinamatography. The redeeming factor of this film is that is has perhaps the best Coca Cola commercial that has ever been made and not used in America. For hard core movie buffs only.
5,A training manual on cultural differences,"I was fortunate enough to view this movie before trying to expand my business into Australia. It helped me avoid a number of mistakes. I realize it wasn't meant to be a training film, but it sure worked for me. Now, if only, I could find that distinctly Australian sound!"
1,I was not entertained.,"While I respect the opinions of others, I just don't get why anyone would like this movie. I had to force myself to finish watching this film and was very disappointed with pretty much every aspect of it. The leading lady, Greta Scacchi, plays a likable quirky character that I was able to get behind, but I could not get past how much I disliked Becker (Eric Roberts' character). I bought this movie after reading all the good reviews and just thought a negative one should be posted for the benefit of potential purchasers."
1,beyond the pale,"While the idea of a book for children about the natural process of defecation might have seemed like a good idea, the scratch-and-sniff turd on page 7, I feel, was going too far."
1,Not appropriate for small children,"I have serious concerns with the book David Smells. I strongly feel that the illustration is frightening for the very young children that it is marketed to. This is because it frightened my 2 year old son.Very young children should not be expected to rationalize the illustration in David Smells, as young children are especially sensitive to grotesque-like visual images. Children do not have the cognitive capacity to put what they're seeing in perspective. In addition, I feel the story is portrayed as disrespectful and rough.The 5 senses is obviously a good subject, but this book is exceedingly poor at representing them. Shouldn't children be able to learn about the 5 senses without resorting to defecation? This is not the type of humor I want to instill in my children. This books content and illustration go too far out of the realm of what is acceptable for a two year old."
5,Another marvelously funny beginning reader!,"I am such a fan of Shannon's work! GREAT illustrations, simple vocabulary, totally amusing stories that pre-school or primary grade children can really identify with PLUS no matter how outrageous David's behavior each book ends with the assurance that while we might deplore the behavior...we always LOVE the child. Absolutely excellent on all levels!"
4,"The Bean's favorite Diaper David book (this month, anyway)","David Shannon, <strong>David Smells!</strong> (Blue Sky Press, 2005)Of the three Diaper David books, <em>David Smells!</em>, a book about the five senses, is my son's current favorite, the one he reaches for most often of the three and wants me to read to him. Now, I have no idea why this is; all three are wonderfully illustrated, with short, fun text blocks and enough repetition (even between the books, which were obviously conceived and written as one project--this is not something one normally thinks about in pre-lit, but it turns out it's an important idea) to nudge the kid that much further towards speech. And needless to say, my kid is not your kid, who may be more crazy about <em>Oops!</em> or <em>No, David!</em> right now. But I can tell you that my eleven-month-old budding reviewer has expressed a definite preference--at least this month--for this one, and that's good enough for me. ***"
4,The Return Of Ike Turner!,"Abusive, addicted, arrested and convicted. As if that were not enough, his woman left him and, as he sat for years in a drugged stupor, that woman reached mega star status, fame and fortune. If that is not the story of a man born to sing the blues, I don't know what is! Could Ike recover and put together any semblance of a thriving career? Only time will tell. On ""Here and Now"", Ike attempts to put his past behind him and releases his first all-new recording in over 20 years. It's a CD serving up a little Blues garnished with a touch of R&B, funk, country and swing. A sampling of the songs will show the diversity of the recording. Perhaps the most interesting song on the disc is ""I Need A-Nuddin'"" which appears to be a tongue-in-cheek rendition of the excesses that plagued Ike during his earlier days. Whether you like him or not, it would be hard to deny that he has poured his heart and soul into this fine release."
1,JUST AS I SUSPECTED,"I LISTENED TO THIS TO CONFIRM WHAT I ALREADY KNEW. TINA WAS THE WHOLE SHOW. THE ONLY THING IKE DID WAS STAND IN THE BACK AND SAY ""ROLLIN"" EVERY NOW AND THEN.I WOULD BE AGAINST EVERY PRINCIPAL I HAVE TO SPEND A PENNY ON THIS MAN."
5,here and now,absolutely the best album i have purchased in years. i never knew that ike was this dynamic. rocket 88 is truely the first rock n roll song. i would recommend this album to anyone who likes to boogie!
3,a little too slick,"I saw Ike on Conan, and thought he and his band were blistering. The band was tight and Ike was wailing away.Unfortunately, I don't hear the same energy on the CD. It's a little over-produced....a bit too slick for my liking. I like blues that are a little more raw."
2,not quite THAT hot..,"I had very high hopes for this album, but I can't help finding it pretty derivative - although musicianship is solid, there's nothing TOO exciting going on. I guess I was expecting a more inspired offering form the controversial and mercurial Mr. Turner. Many tunes (written by WHOM, extacly?) are makeovers of already existing material, albeit with new/other lyrics. For example, ""Ike's Theme"" is merely Freddie King's ""The Stumble"" rehashed, and lacking the catchy hook of the original. On the up side: Ike's vocals are raw, strong and punchy, PLUS he's wearing a nasty lime green jacket, so some credit IS due."
3,Starring who?,"Even Amazon webmasters make typos. This documentary stars the great R-O-D Serling of Twilight Zone fame, not Rob Serling. When I saw this I wondered if Rob was related to Rod... unmistakable voice!"
3,Bracket on dipstick not lined up properly,I chose this dipstick because I purchased a Summit Racing 6 quart oil pan and the application on the Summit website recommended this model. The bracket that is mounted on the dipstick that connects to the header bolt is extended 3 inches higher when installed so it had to be modified for a perfect fit. So Amazon is not at fault for this erroneous purchase. It is Summit Racing.
4,Great debut novel,"I picked this up because of the great quotes on the back cover, and because I always enjoy reading something by an author I haven't yet discovered. Although it took a bit for me to get caught up in it, once the story really took hold, it was impossible to put down, and it stuck with me for a long time afterwards."
5,Extraordinary,"I wasn't sure I'd be interested in the subject matter of this novel, but it's an amazing book - an idiosyncratic page turner, which really makes you think. I was struck by the way the author showed Anne's identification with Ana, and made us identify with Ana and her family, too. Now when I hear about people in Bosnia, they are no longer a blur of statistics. I loved this book. The second half is particularly compelling."
2,"straps slip, buckle pulls through","This strap barely does its job. I've used the strap for 2 weeks and found that the straps slip too easily and I even had the buckle slip off the end of the strap and fall on the floor. The equinox Tinamou sternum strap is much better designed. I had the equinox strap on a previous pack for a year with no problems. Unfortunately, when I went to order the equinox strap again it was unavailable so I settled for the Outdoor Research strap. Luckily I found an alternative vendor and now have an equinox strap back on my pack."
2,Good for a few weeks of play,"My daughter loves Polly Pocket and has had only the Quik-Clik clothes before now. These clothes slide on and have a slight greasy feel at first. When this finally wears off it's near impossible to dress these dolls. Somebody told me to try baby powder, and it does help, but not for long."
1,Horrible Customer Service & Product,I ordered this product and did recieve then a couple months later it broke. Now Ive done everything I was told to do by by shipping back for a replacement and nothing. They wont return Emails i havent received the replacement part.
3,The Greatest Tractor Show on Earth Ever,It is an ok video. The narrator does not sound like he is from the US. It did not hold my children's attention for very long.
4,A snapshot of Fred live,"This is a picture of live Fred; straight, no chaser. No filler, just the music and the fun of a live Eaglesmith show. A good starter for new fans with strong samples from previous albumns, but lots of new,or previously unreleased songs. Trains, cars, guns and booze, the Fred standards are all here. The hilarious White Trash, and Big Hair, the tearful Carter and Alcohol & Pills. If you are a Fredhead buy it for the new material, if you have no other Eaglesmith buy it to experience Fred live>"
3,"Pleasant, but not essential, even for fans","This is Hedningarna's first album, which has, for a long time, not been available in the U.S. Folks who've become familiar with Hedningarna from outstanding folk-rock explorations like _Kaksi_ or their recent _Karelia Visa_ may be quite surprised by the band's first disk. Here, the band is purely an instrumental trio-- the two haunting female vocalists aren't present (nor are any other vocalists). Also, there are few (if any?) rock influences here at all. It's still a pleasant Scandinavian folk album, mind you, but it's not as original, as full-sounding, or as essential as the band's later folk-rock efforts."
2,Okay,"This isn't Hedningarna's best--it is fun to listen too, but I found it a little repetitious. If you want to experience this group, try for something a little newer."
5,Must-Have For Any Knight Rider Fan,"This is one of the best die cast KITT models out there. Fairly durable, with the exception of the wheel that controls the scanner, it fell off the first hour I had it. But I managed to fix it with some Krazy Glue. The only problem with the replica, is that KITT's rims from the show were black and the wheels on the model are just normal. (of coarse I'm a wierd stickler for details :P) Other then that, I highly recommend it for any Knight Rider fan."
2,why im turned away from buying.,The only thing i dont like about the car is.. The tires shouldnt have silver hubcaps. Kitt had black. The detail in the car and hood is nice. This is the only reason why i wont spend 60+ dollars on the product
2,Hovercraft,i am actually pretty disappointed in this toy. Doesn't really do what we thought it would.
4,comfy,"Stays inflated for extended time. Meets claims for less bounce and no rolling to the middle. Liked it, bought 2."
2,air mattress,i bought 4 mattresses in july..it is now august and 3 of them have punctured. I do not advise anyone to get these...also one side would always be less pumped up than the other
1,coleman air bed,"I purchased 3 coleman airbeds for my sister and her family of five. 2 of them were 1/3 full by the next morning. It was also a pain trying to inflate this thing, the thing kept on leaking after I pull out the pump from its valves, I much prefer the ones with a built-in air pump, I used them before at my friends place, they were much better at holding air and operations......Maybe I was just unlucky, but this is the last time I buy another air mattress under the Coleman brand."
1,1 side didn't hold air after a couple hours of use..,"after our second night on it, one of us was sleeping on the floor, mind you, the first night it was only used for 2 hours. one reason we bought it was b/c a previous reviewer claimed to be 300 lbs and slept on it comfortably with his wife who was a lot smaller. therefore, we thought it would work out for us, but it infact did not. would also like to add that we camped on polo fields, on a predesignated camping site, so it was not the type of conditions that would cause it to pop."
5,Nice product,"It is very nice looking, quality product. Assembly wasn't so bad. I have put many of these types of things together so i had experience. Once put together, the roominess inside is surprising. I would recommend purchasing this product."
3,Not A Bad Release!,"Individual taste in music vary greatly. That is especially true with the blues where you have so many varieties it's often hard to keep track of all of the artists. Every once and awhile, I receive a recommendation from a friend that turns out to be pretty good. Such was the case with the Beat Daddys third release, Delta Vision. Having never heard of them, I pushed the newly received disc to number 400 in my changer and waited for its turn to come up. About two months later, Delta Vision came on and I was pleasantly surprised with what I heard. The disc has some pretty catchy and easy to listen to tunes and I now find myself carrying a copy in my car. If you like your blues with a Southern bent, give this a listen."
5,A Series That Every Family Should Watch Together,"Our family LOVES this series. We watch it every week and our school-age kids have learned tons of interesting information that brings American and World History to life for them. It's thoroughly researched, professionally produced and un-biased--traits that are sorely missing in many of the textbooks our students are using today.This should be required viewing in every home and classroom."
3,Not really trying to uncover as much as they could have ...,"It is true that the show tells only portions of the truth and doesn't really seem to want to uncover the whole truth but it's a start for people who don't have the time to do their own investigations or for those who don't have any idea that these events are going on ... or for those that need to be spoon fed. But if one is really serious about uncovering any subject placed before them, take what's given, then be responsible and do your own research to find what may be missing ... And this series is missing a lot. For that I give it 3 stars just only for presenting the subjects and having it on the History Channel. The minus of what could have been 1 or 2 more stars is based on the series not really trying to uncover as much as they know they could have."
2,Damaged,"We received the item promptly, but when we went to play the DVD it was damaged. It was constantly skipping. We returned the product and exchanged it for another, but the new one had the same problem."
2,A Lowpoint for Stabbing Westward,"As an ardent fan of Stabbing Westward, I'd have to say that this album was a great shock to me. While Darkest Days, their previous record, was showing signs of decreasing hard rythms and emotional sound, I did not expect their next recording to fall so far beneath my expectations.The hard rock and industrial feel of Ungod and subsequent carryover to Whither, Blister, Burn and Peel is totally gone in the songs on the new self-titled CD.To me, all of the feeling has been stripped of their music. Even the haunting voice Chris Hall normall sings with is vanished. Though it pains me to say so, anyone who was a fan of previous Stabbing Westward efforts would probably not enjoy this CD. It could probably be categorized more as 'Pop' than as 'Rock' music.-Zilean"
1,Good only if u hated the last ones,"Im rather dissapointed really. When i first heard their single from Darkest Days, Save Yourself, i went out and bought their first 3 cds. i was excited when i bought the new cd, but now its just depressing. If ur the kind of person who thought Whither Blister Burn and Peel as well as Darkest Days, were pure crap, and u love pop, ur going to be semiinterested, but if u like good old depressed hard rock, find someone else!!"
1,Where's the ANGER!,"Stabbing Westward were one of the few bands I would automatically purchased a new release from... I emphasize 'were'. This CD is a huge dissapointment! I liked Stabbing Westward mainly because of the industrialish angst they were able to portray in their previous releases. In this album we have a VERY mainstream alternative-rock style that lacks any sought of punch. Quite simply, Stabbing Westward have produced a alumn with whinning vocals and B-rate music that gives the impression of being written for a 'hard-rock' (sarcasm) soundtrack to some B-rate college football/romance movie. So weak I could not find one track that I appreciate.P.S. if you like this style of music though, I strongly suggest you check out a band called ""Powderfinger"" who should show you how mainstream-alternative rock should be done."
4,There are fans...,"...and then there are FANS. Just as Marilyn lost some of his with Mechanical Animals, and Trent lost some with the Fragile, so too will Chris and SW lose a few with this album. However, ""fans"" that become deserters with the hint of a new sound are deplorable indeed. Stabbing Westward has gone in a different direction, but they've done an impressive job of it. Although I DO admit that I am more partial to the previous three albums, the self-titled fourth release is still excellent. True fans will be willing to follow Stabbing Westward to new territory, and enjoy the ride."
2,Disappointing,"In all honesty, this album is not bad, but it's just not SW. If your a first time listener to SW, then you may enjoy this, but it was nothing special for a fan of such songs as ""Haunting Me,"" ""This is Where it Falls Apart,"" ""Sometimes It Hurts.""The only song I waste any time with is track one, since a hint of industrial remains on it."
1,speachless,"i cant really think of a way to rate this cd. From ungod to WBB+P stabbing westward changed. But the fans were still loyal because WWB+P was such a great cd. And after the arrival of Darkest Days, which was such an excelent cd, most fans were unable to await the next cd. but with the arrival of this .....i cant think of what to say. Maybe they got bored with being a great band that made no money. now they want to follow the rest of the world and go mainstream. maybe i am overreacting and after awhile the new cd will sink in, but the only thing that i can think of is to ask the radios to play this stuff so their change isnt totaly useless."
2,Of all the groups I thought would never sell out...,"I find it more than a little ironic that a group that has had such wonderfully dark music about depression, betrayal and dysfunctional relationships could so horribly betray their loyal fans with this gutless, pop-radio friendly, mainstream .... It's hard to believe this is the same four-member lineup that created the bleak mood on their second album (Wither, Blister, Burn + Peel) that seems to revel in it's own torment. Am I bitter? Absolutely! If you like their previous albums, do not buy this."
3,Average,"This album isn't anything like any of the others at all. Stabbing Westward went away from their industrial roots, and tried to make a pop album. The only thing that even sounds remotly industrial is ""Television"". The CD overall is an ok outing considering they did it to get out of their contract with their lable."
2,Terrible sell outs,"when i first heard ""Darkest Days"" i assumed this cd would be good, which was a big mistake. they sold out, they went from alternative metal to alternative pop, this cd flat out sucks..."
2,A good band gone terribly wrong.,"Stabbing Westward is one of my favorite bands of all time. When I first picked up their new record, I was very excited about the possibilities the album possesed. Unfortionately, after the first few tracks, it became terribly evident that the band had completely abandened their old style for the sake of ""growth"". When bands try to grow, this is normally a good thing. In this case, however, Stabbing Westward completely rejected everything that made their band popular in the first place. The anger driven, electronic distorted vocals that were the core of the songs had been replaced with a whiny, nasely voice that took away all the feeling in the songs. I heard that shortly after this album was released, the band parted ways with their label, Koch Records. Frankly, I'm not surprized. My recommendation - Stay away from this album. Go buy one of their earlier albums. You'll be thankful you did."
3,Love for stabbing westward,"There are no bad songs on this album, however this album is so commercial it all sounds alike which is not good, they went from a techno industrial band with Ungod to mainstream industrial rock with Darkest Days and now they are simply pure rock gods with their latest self titled CD. This CD continues where their song Dawn on the Escape from LA soundtrack left off with good guitars, great lyrics and uncharacteristically a rare bit of synth on the album. Everything is so commercially mainstream that there will be lots of hits off this album, like the songs So Far Away, Perfect and the Only Time. There is even a heartfelt ballad unbecoming of Stabbing Westward entitled I Remember."
1,La pire piece de merde que j'ai jamais entendu.,"This is an example of a group that has gone 'popular' in order to A. satisfy his contracts with the publishers or B. make more money, or C. All of the above.Unfortunately, that plan didn't include innovation, refinement and what the old fans of the group were looking for in this new album. This album isn't even worth 0.1$, it's a strongly digested product aimed for a market who doesn't know better."
2,Not sure of where SW is headed....,"OK, let me start off by saying that I have given this album enough time by now to see if it will grow on me. Some of the songs on this album are ok, dont get me wrong. I think ""So Far Away"", ""Perfect"", and ""The Only Thing"" are decent songs. However many of the songs on this CD are so bland, and are definetly not SW style whatsoever. Some of the songs dont carry a lot of feeling, and change of melody...like most droning rock bands in the music industry today. SW's last album Darkest Days was ground breaking material for the band, but you have to wonder where they are headed with this. So in conclusion, there are a few decent songs on the disc, but I think your money is much better spent on another CD than this one. Check out WBB+P or Darkest Days, they are much more quality CD's."
2,I Weep For The Future...,"Where did it all go? How can wonderland burst into TRL flames? Chris Hall and the rest of his band used to bring me to emotional depths that amazed me - how could any one group accurately describe how I felt? In anxious anticipation of the new CD, I listened to their older albums for days on end. Then,[when I received] my brand new copy of ""Stabbing Westward"" and was elated with the seemingly haunting and yet promising cover art. Into the CD player it went, and that's when Camelot burned. Is fame and fortune that necessary? Where is the driving guitar and the infused industrial electronics? The symbolic lyrical lines and the raw emotion? Gone. Poof. Just like that. Now they sound just like every other single alternative band. Please get it together, boys. What would the world be without you?"
2,Opposite extreme,"For anyone who expects the industrial alternative sound of past CDs, you will be sorely disappointed by this pop production. I understand a band's need to grow and explore new directions, but all I could think of while listening to this is that the band sold out to commercialism. I much prefer their previous works, dark as they were, and longed to hear similar creativity and edge in this CD. What really drove home the departure was the last song on the CD, which has a touch of the old sound, where the lyrics seem to suggest that they had no option but to submit to television drones (their new target audience?) who prefer this style."
3,Too mellow.,"Dont get me wrong i like some softer stuff (being a big Cure and pumpkins fan)But the jump they made was just too big for me to take the full affect.From INdustrial rock to soft rock ballads wasnt in my view a good idea.Im not saying its a bad album its a very good album,Its accesible,its easy on the ears and its got nice lyrics but its just too soft."
5,Slidding Underground,"First off.... many people in here make some kind of reference to Nine Inch Nails in thier reviews.I must say Stabbing Westward sound nothing like Nine Inch Nails, and I own every NiN album.I just recently heard this album,and I was blown away, I own Wither Blister Burn and Peel and it is no where near as good as this though it is awesome.My favorite songs on this cd are Drugstore, and The Thing I hate. The Guitars on Drugstore really remind me of KMFDM and the synth is very awesome and agressive,reminds me a lot of Front Line Assembly.The vocals are all very clean.This album took a deep breath and dived further into the underground industrial scene.As much as I really like Nine Inch Nails I would have to say that this album from stabbing Westward is the best place for beginers to start if they want to get that modern Metropolis Industrial feel.until later my friends"
2,not stabbing westward... i don't really like it,"i first knew about this cd when i saw new SW files on napster which i didn't know. i grabbed them, and well didn't think it was SW. but pretty quickly i recognized christopher hall's voice. well i hoped that these songs (perfect & television) were only b-sides and won't ever be released. in a naive mood i bought the cd. hell what a disapointment. first of all: this cd is totaly radiofriendly. take ""so far away"" for instance: you can sing the chorus after hearing at twice. obviously SW wanted to finally make some money on this cd. i'll give it 2 stars due some songs are well-written"
1,should be a zero...,"Their previous album Darkest days was a masterpiece filled with metal/industrial/gothic beauty. After that album, They dissapeared for quite some time and resurfaced with this album. What a load of garbage, way to dissapoint the masses you garnered with your first albums! Not only did the switch styles to 'euro-pop' as some people put it, but they also blatantly ripped off an entire deftones song with Perfect(which is the same exact tuning and chords in the same order and tempo as Deftones ""Knife party"" off of the White Pony album).I can totally see why these guys broke up, this album ruined their career!If you really want to hear what this band is about check out Darkest days, their masterpiece/"
1,Big Letdown. Very Uninspired music.,"I have been a big fan of stabbing Westward since Wither.., but I cant honestly say I like where they are going with this ""new musical direction"" of theirs. The first three songs are really good songs even though they are not heavy at all. ""so far away"" has the classic SW sound. ""Perfect"", has a nice depressing pop ballad sound to it that maybe new to SW, but ends up being a great song. The best song on the cd is ""I remember"". This song is a tear jerker because of its ability to bring out emotions of lost love like classic glam metal ballads of the 80's. It is not a glam metal song, it just captures that emotion. ""I remember"" will be one of the greatest SW songs to remember. The rest of the cd is very uninspired and cannot compare to SW of yesterdays. Barely any electronics and heavyness, also goodbye to great songwriting. Darkest days was a masterpiece of depretion and emotion. I wish for those days."
2,"Primitive and uninspiring, just does not sound authentic","I am sorry to say that this was such a bad book, I really was expecting something much better. Bella wrote about her childhood in Vitebsk (Belarus) in a fake ""children"" style, i.e. using language you see in a homework essay of a ten year old. It was supposed to be cute. But it just did not sound right for me. Second, there are almost no country-specific details at all. Bella does not care about Belarusian culture or the fact that it was under Russian occupation at that point. So, over all, the best thing about this book is Marc Chagall's little graphics. They are so nice and so Belarusian and really convey the feeling of nostalgy for Vitebsk, where I've been on a few occasions. It may be very interesting and educational for a Western reader who does not know anything at all about life in Belarus, (then under the Russian empirial rule), but personally I expected much more."
4,A propaganda film about Nazi propaganda films,"Swastika was really quite an excellent film and the DVD release quality is very good. The only bad elements about the DVD were the grandiose commentaries by the original production team, which are peppered with inaccuracies, distortions and , pardon the term, propaganda. Buy the DVD, watch the film, avoid the so called ""special features"". There is an especially vicious little vignette on ""The Leni Riefenstahl Myth"" which undoubtedly has her spinning in her grave."
4,banned=truth,Anything banned by Israel and occupied Germany must tell truths that do not flatter the lying murderers today. Another review will be placed after consumption.
4,Pam Tillis Collection,I bought this CD just for the song The River and the Highway which I think is one of the most beautiful songs ever. I loaded it on my MP3 player and really enjoy the rest of it as well.
4,"Good information, some is outdated.","Growing Green Babies did have a lot of great information and I would recommend this to any mother that is concerned with her newborn baby's well being. It talked a lot about formaldehyde in baby furniture made with particle board, wooden toys, the importance of organic foods (and which conventional foods you can get away with buying and eating) as well as non-toxic cleaning and the importance of organic cotton in baby clothing. I did notice that the video touched on playing classical music to your belly, and as a psychology student I know that the Mozart effect has since been disproved. That was the only inaccuracy that I found in the video. I am glad that I did purchase this movie, as I am now 1000 times more afraid to buy anything non-organic for my baby. It is amazing what harmful products corporations get away with selling."
5,Another Awesome Color,"Gray, Yellow, Blue - I can't wait for the next color! Really hoping for a Captain America book. The Hulk book is awesome and if I have to compare, my second favorite, Spider-Man: Blue being the absolute best one - hands down! Whereas in the other two books, the main character is talking to a deceased loved one, here, Banner is talking to his psychiatrist friend and reliving his ordeal of how he became hulk, his battle with the army, his battle with Iron Man, that's right IRON MAN! And lastly, his relationship with Betty. A very deep, emotional book with just stunning artwork. The illustrations are so good, I would not even call it a graphic novel, it's just a work of art! Huge fan of this team and pretty much hooked on whatever they churn out."
3,Poco Greatest Hits,"Well, I love a few of these songs but in between there are a few that dip into the ""Country Music"" category. I never thought of them as being country. But, all in all, it's a good ""listen-to""!"
4,Sound Incredible - Look Bad (after 1 year outdoors),"The outdoor speakers sound outstanding. Love the power they push. We have them under eaves of house, angled inward towards pool area, and sound blends perfectly. Take the time to position them correctly (swivel in & out/up & down), adjust levels, and you won't be disappointed with what your hear. The only issue I have found is the grill is showing rust spots (supposed to be rustproof) & white housing turning yellowish, so they look much older than 1 year, and are a bit of an eye sore.4 out of 5, due to the way they look.Russ A."
1,Junk!,absolutely junk...in both sound and how they were packed for delieery...if I were the seleor I'd be really em-bare--assed tover sell that type of junk!!!!!!!Be smart...don't but it.
1,Quite after 2 months!,Both speakers completely and suddenly quit after 2 months of use. There was no power surge. They were mounted outside but under a roof and were not exposed to any rain - just indirect sun.
2,Not so great,"You get what you pay for and these are gutless. I'm driving them with a Dennon receiver and they have weak highs and shallow base.These are good outdoor ""disposable"" speakers with marginal quality."
1,Junk,These speakers are just that a pile of #%*% !! Mounting system obviously was designed by a 3 year old....un real...
2,Rusts and fades,"Although the sound is good and the price very reasonable, the grills rust after four months on the deck. The bright white cabinets fades to a yellowish tint after six months on the deck. Even though the sound is still good, they look terrible."
4,Good value,So far I am happy with my purchase. The sound quality is reasonable for outdoor speakers. And the build-quality seems good. I would say they are a good value for the price.
3,Most disappointing leap frog product I've seen.,"We have bought leap frog products for our son since he was an infant. I have loved them all, as has my son. He is 4yrs old now and got this game for Christmas. It is still a great educational toy, but it is not made well. The idea is like connect four, but the cardboard pieces don't fall in and out as well as they should, and some of the games depend on you lining the bus up on a cardboard mat on the ground. It is difficult for my little one to line up the columns on the ground with the appropriate columns above, as the don't line up that great. It is a good educational toy, but not what I have come to expect from leap frog products."
5,Awesome,"This is the exact, truthful, information I was looking for. A must read, for all seekers, especially now that the Goddess is returning."
1,"Yet another ""Skip Press"" dud","This is yet another fill-in-the-form book by ""Skip Press."" The book gives the reader every impression that it was written by a computer program, and not a very good program at that: it is ""formula writing"" at its worse."
2,Disappointing,"While Blackadder deserves a solid episode guide providing background and details on the creation of one of the best sitcoms of all time, Blackadder never deserved Cunning. This book isn't so much an episode guide as it is a compendium of factoids, character moments, and quotes from the show. Rather than go behind the scenes and analyze the series in depth, Howarth and Lyons take a fanboy approach to the series, and as a consequence this book reads like something written by two fans on a drunken lark off the top of their collective memories. Watch the episodes to enjoy and experience the real Blackadder, and leave books like Cunning to the wayside. This book is best avoided."
3,This book lacked detailed information to accompany the photo,This book showed several good examples of each conformation fault disscussed. The written descriptions accompanying the photos fell short. This book would make a good photo reference guide for an experienced horseperson. The lack of detailed descriptions describing common conformation faults would not help the novice.
3,In agreement with the review from Vermont,"Being a somewhat beginner in the horse world, I was looking for a book that would help me in the purchase of a horse, and understand the issues of conformation. Some of the lingo used in this book is not American English, but European English, which is lost on me. The photographs are wonderful, but the descriptions - as said above - do fall short."
3,Basic Guides of Bowling,"This book entirely is a book more for a beginner. Yes,learning progress starts from the basic however, if more writing for improving to higher level average bowlers will be a good credit. Not much pictures and illustrations."
3,Another good book for beginners,"Nice book for beginners. Good anecdotes from Anthony which are fun to read.A couple of nice tips about varying the action on the ball through the armswing and turning the sliding foot. Some nice vintage reverse shots of Anthony as a right hander.If you're read one of Dawson Taylor's other books, you've pretty well read this one, except for the aforementioned action tips."
4,excellant bowling technical info,i really loved the information provided by E Anthony. somewhat surprised to see so many pics of taylor.
3,Good book,"Even though Earl Anthony was a lefty this book is written and photographed as if he were a righty. Too bad. It is a great book, but if you are looking for tips from a lefty look elsewhere."
3,Description,"Shortly after Carol Hillary announced her engagement to Dudley Lennox, she fell in love...with another man.Carol thought, when she accepted Dudley's fabulous diamond ring, that she loved him. But then her glamorous mother, the world-famous war correspondent Helen Hillary, returned from the front with young Major Duncan in tow. As soon as Carol saw him, she knew that he was the man she wanted to marry. Besides, Helen didn't really love the major.What Carol didn't know was that even if Helen's heart wasn't involved, her pride was. Helen could not lose a man to another woman without a battle - even when the battlefield was her own daughter's heart."
3,very thin on content,"If you've used Jean Echols' other insect units (Buzzing a Hive, Ant Homes Under the Ground, etc.) you will probably be disappointed by this one. Unlike those comprehensive units, this deals with only one idea: the camouflage of the butterfly. This concept has somehow been teased out into three sessions - very thin sessions. There is no discussion about the butterfly lifecycle, pollination, anatomy... Also missing is a list of butterfly science resources for adults or children . After my good experiences with other GEMS units, the lack of substance in this one really took me by surprise."
5,The Big-Time is Now,"WOW! What can I say about this masterpiece. Every track on this CD is phenomenal. I went to the CD release party for this CD Halfaworldaway, and Mike Farley and the rest of the band put on a show that would compete with big name artists. I bought this CD the day it came out, and love every track more and more each time I listen to them. Do your self a favor and buy this CD. Even if you don't know Mike take a chance on him and you will see you made the right choice. Mike has opened for big bands such as Dave Matthews Band while in Cleveland OH. Mike will make it big and you can be proud to own his CD. Congragulations Mike and to the rest of your band on all your success."
5,Speechless,After I first heard this cd...i was strucken with awe... The only question on my mind is....how can this band be this good and only a handful of people know who they are? That will change soon enough though...Lets hope the whole world will catch on to these guys like we have! These cd is one of the best out there!
5,I LOVE THE MIKE FARLEY BAND,"Mike Farley is an awesome entertainer, and an even better songwriter. This is the type of album where you could listen over and over again and never get tired. And a little side-note, if you ever get to see him in person, he's reallllllyyyy nice to his fans! When you do get to see him, talk to him, he's awesome!"
2,Started to rust after only a few weeks,"This nail brush started to show signs of rust around the bristles after less than 1 month of use. This brush was also hard to hold on to when it's wet and soapy. Something with a handle, or a more ergonomic shape would be better for use in the bath/shower. The bristles aren't as hard as I thought they would be. The 5 rows of bristles on the bottom are much softer than the single row of bristles on the top of the brush.The rust isn't bad enough...yet...to throw the brush away, so it will be demoted to my cleaning bucket to be used on dirt and grime around the house."
3,"Okay, but staples rust.","I've had this for about a month now and the staples that hold the bristles, are already rusted. Since the handle and bristles are white, the rust really shows. It still functions (the bristles are firm enough to get dirt out but not so stiff that it hurts), but it is unsightly. I'm surprised a product designed to be held under running water would have rustable parts."
2,Very soft.,"Not as stiff as I hoped. A very good hair brush for a baby or elderly person but not a great nail brush. I use it to ""comb"" my 83 year old mother's hair. Very soft."
1,Disappointed,"I have used other Tweezerman products and assumed that this item would live up to their standards, but I was wrong. I have used mine only once and after 3 months the base of every group of brushes shows signs of rust - not just a little rust but a lot. I thought at first it might be some kind of mildew, but a wash with a bleach solution did nothing. It is definitely rust. If you like this rusty look in your shower, then this brush is for you. I can't imagine why any manufacturer would put together a brush meant to be used with water with anything that would rust."
1,Tweezrman Dual Surface Nail Brush,"After 1 use, the brush fell apart into 2 pieces - Sorry that I trusted the brand name - wish there was a replacement for it - Very disappointed in Tweezerman"
2,Cheap,"Thought the bristles would be firmer. Also, there's no way to set it down without one side of the bristles or the other getting wet.Don't think it'll last very long."
4,The best,Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a years but when I tried this product I loved it. It is the best nail brush ever.
4,Rusts over time,I really like this product for getting my nails clean. I paint and garden a lot so it is perfect for getting behind the nails. The only thing I don't like about it is that the bristles start getting rusty over time. I think whatever holds them in place behind the plastic is rusting. The brush still performs as advertised but it just looks a little gross. They are cheap enough though that you just buy a few and discard when they get rusty.
4,Great tool!,This was a great addition to my manicure/pedicure toolkit. I think every girl needs to have a nail brush especially a girl who is always getting dirty :-)
3,comes apart,Tweezerman Dual Surface Nail BrushThis brush does a nice job but it is a pain putting it back together often. It's made of two parts and they separate.
5,Great nail cleaner,"After transplanting 8 trees and doing a bunch of other gardening and maintenance work, I had a party to attend. I used this excellent brush to clean under and over my nails and hands, to get them sparkling clean. Works very well to get all the grit and grime out.Perfect size to fit in the palm of the hand, and good design with dual set of bristles."
3,"Too Soft, Too Difficult to Hold","I like that it is larger than most which could have made it easy to hold when scrubbing your nails...untill it gets wet and soapy. Because the plastic sides of the brush are smooth and rounded when you add water, soap and vigerous scrubbing and it makes the brush difficult to hold on to.The bristles are too soft, and the rows are spaced too far apart. I have run into softer brushes which are worthless but if you have crubby gardening, construction, or mechanics hands this brush won't work well for you.I'd expected the top bristles to be much more firm."
4,Gets the dirt out.,"Others have commented that the brush is a little soft, and it is, but that's why you have the dual surfaces. It took some getting used to the softer bristles, my old nail brush had a similar dual surface setup, but only once I started using this one did I realize that it didn't need to be that firm and that my old one was beating up the skin at the tip of my fingers.Overall this brush does a good job under the nails and the bristles are firm enough to scrub out grease and dirt from dry rough/calloused skin. The only down side is that I go through about 3 of these a year, but they're cheap enough imo."
2,Plastic Cracked,"I only had this brush for about a month until it fell off a shower shelf and the plastic cracked. At that point the brush split into two pieces. I snapped the pieces back together, but a few weeks later it fell off the shelf again causing a few entire chunks of plastic to splinter off one side of the brush. It wouldn't snap back together. I threw half of the brush away and still use the other half. Even before it broke I would have only given this brush 3 stars. The bristles are too soft to do any serious scrubbing. It's my least favorite finger nail brush that I have ever owned and the only one that has ever had the plastic crack."
5,Loved it.,Loved it. The brush is just what I was looking for to replace a brush 50 yrs old brush. I could use a couple more but the postage just isn't worth it. Had I know if I could have gotten a couple more for the same postage that would have been good.
1,Too soft,"After reading the numerous positive reviews I felt confident about buying this nail brush... that was a mistake. The brush costs more than most other nail brushes, but I figured it must be worth it... considering the Tweezerman name and the reviews. It is actually awkward to handle and the bristles are really soft and widely spaced... I dislike this Tweezerman nail brush more than any of the other nail brushes I have purchased. I'm still looking."
2,Tweezerman Nail Brush,"I purchase this product and initially it worked very well. I like the design, it fits very well in your hand...that's why it received the stars I gave it. Why only 2 stars..the plastic is very smooth, if you use this in the shower it becomes very slippery and will fall out of your hand quite easily. I had dropped this in my shower and it cracked (very brittle)...once it cracked the it was susceptible to mold (water gets trapped inside). I had to throw mine in the trash. If they make changes to the product I may consider purchasing, but in my opinion not worth the money."
2,Starring who?,"I'm confused, the show I remember starred Ron Perlman andLinda Hamilton and even the really bad cover does look likethem."
5,YOU GOTTA LOVE THIS LOVE STORY..WE ALL WANT A VINCENT LOL,trying to replace my vhs with my favorite dvd's and you make it easier thanks so much Merry Christmas and a happy new year blessed be
2,Beauty & The Beast -- The Complete Series,"This CD grouping was labeled ""new"". Perhaps even with ""new"" recordings there are glitchs; however, there were MANY SKIPS and places HUNG UP on these CD's. Is there any way those can be checked BEFORE they go out to the public? It is very frustrating to be in the middle of an episode when the thing hangs up and won't go any further, or it is so splotchy and interrupted, that the joy of watching it is diminished. I may be returning these."
3,Don't Bother,"If you've already purchased the show's three seasons separately, don't bother with the boxed set, as it's a complete waste of money.In addition to the strangely altered image of Vincent on the box, the ""bonus"" disc is insulting to long-time fans. ""Newly Reconstructed Love Letters"" is read by God-knows-who ... certainly not Ron Perlman. Ridiculous. If you bought the VHS tapes way back when, you already have the original love letters, which also appear on the bonus disc.Besides the love letters, the only other two features are episodic promos for some first season episodes - and ""Vincent's Quest"" - an interactive trivia game. No interviews, no deleted scenes, no behind-the-scenes footage ... nothing to warrant spending $70 if you've already purchased all three seasons individually.What a disappointment."
4,Beauty and the Beast Complete Series Set,"All episodes are here. Extras very disappointing. No deleted scenes, bloopers, behind the scene footage, etc. Only a few stilted interviews with Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton."
2,MUTIPLE DEFECTIVE DISCS IN THIS SET !,"I am going on my third boxed set of Beauty and The Beast The Complete Series !Each set has multiple discs which are seriously defective ! The picture breaks up into digital pixels and slows the DVD player to a near stop, losing the audio in the process ! When you try to fast forward the disc completely locks the player !Apparently, there is a huge quality control issue with this series !If I could get a perfect copy of the series...I'd give the set a 5 star rating ! The series is even more magical on disc without commercials ...I'm so glad it is finally available...Now if I can only get a set of 16 perfect DVDs !!!"
5,Loved the Series,"Enjoyed watching the TV show years ago, and enjoyed reliving the show again. Would highly recommend purchasing this complete series."
5,I loved it!!!,"I am a big fan of BATB. I was extremely happy when I learnt that the show was available in DVD. The thrid season is not as bad as many said but it is not the same without Catherine. However, it should not end without Vincent finding his son. I only missed more extra material."
5,The TV Box-Set Of The Year for `08,"Beauty And The Beast - Complete Series , is without a doubt the best TV show box set of the year, It is great to have all the episodes in one very nice box. The extras , like Vincent's poetry would be another CD to buy , but it is included in this box set. I would have liked them to clean it up ( video ) and remaster the audio in 5.1 , but hey atleast we have a really good set. Always enjoyed the show and just recently my vcr ate one my my vhs tapes , so this was great timing for the box set to be released. If your a fan , it is a must buy."
3,"Wonderful series, bad disc","I fell in love with the series in the original television airing so finding a complete set of the show on DVD was great. But after buying the complete series from Amazon I was disappointed with the set. While the sharpness and clarity are excellent, a lot of the episodes do not play well; they will stop and loose audio and a lot of pixels appear on the screen. Some of my favorite episodes are unwatchable because of this problem. ""A children's Story"", ""Dead of Winter"" and many others have this problem. One of my favorites ""When the Bluebird Sings"" also is bad. Has this happened to anyone else who bought this set or is it just mine? I have bought from other distributers but they do not have the sharpness or clarity this set has, I just wish all episodes played correctly."
4,Overjoyed and Disappointed,"This series has gotten me through some dark times! I have watched all of season one and find I have to return the whole set! I am so disappointed several of the DVD's appear to be damaged. During some of the episodes scenes will freeze and ""digital?"" squares corrupt the scene. I did not pay for damaged scenes! This series is way to important!I haven't tried the extra features yet, I expected more of them though. Artwork could be better!"
4,Infinite Stars for the Series; 4 for the Packaging,"This is my favorite series of all time and it's a good price for the three seasons. I agree that the packaging is terrible and it's disappointing that there was no meat to the extras - no out-takes, etc. I am so grateful to have it on DVD. thank you, Ron Koslow!"
3,hilarious,"one of the funniest damn shows ive ever seen, it was a gift for my mom and she was mad that i laughed but WOW lol"
2,Was excited . . .,I enjoyed this TV series and was looking forward to watching it again. Unfortunately multiple discs would not play properly. I have have seen other reviews where others have had the same problem.
5,Beauty and the Beast,"I bought this as a gift for my mom for her birthday. She loved this show, I ordered the complete set and it was delivered before her birthday. It was in great condition. I watched an episode of the new version that is on the CW, but it wasn't nearly as good as the original."
4,Good series for the time it was aired...,"I purchased this series for my grown daughter, who is going through a ""Beauty and The Beast"" phase, trying to see as many films/series as she can.I am enjoying watching this serieswith her, we are almost done the third season.Very good for the time it was aired (80's). The make-up is pretty good, also. Many of the episodes in the first and second seasons are individual shows, with some ""cases"" being revisited later in each season. There are also some returning characters. It seems that the love story is the main theme, after the introduction of all the characters during the beginning shows of the first season.We love how the third season is a continuing storyline. Anxious to see how it ends."
4,beauty and the beast the complete series,"unfortunately, the dvds were defective, but the seller was very cooperative, and did everything he could to rectify the problem. I was very impressed with his help and concern."
5,Best love story ever.,"I am a gambler and I remember the very first episode I was in Atlantic City,I left instrutions for my husband to tape it and low and behold it came on in the hotel room, was I a happy camper. Needless to say gambling had to wait until it went off.Ms. Mary"
5,Beauty and the Beast,Always loved the show when it was on...didn't think i would find the series..but as always.. amazon came through!!...thank you!..M.D.Kessler
5,Beauty & the Beast DVD,This DVD was a gift to a friend for keeping my dog. My friend said she has really enjoyed this series. This was a great buy at Amazon!
4,great present for a big fan,"i bought this for my mom because she was a huge fan of the series and she's very happy with it... however, from what i've seen from watching some episodes with her, the video is pretty bad. there was apparently no effort to improve the picture quality. i'm also not impressed with the special features. i did however get a very good deal on the set and think i got my money's worth. the smile on my mom's face says it all.i also want to say, i got my item ahead of the projected arrival date which always makes me happy"
1,Usury,Good for Cult viewing but hardly worth the highly inflated price. The characters are thin and often one-dimensional. Too pricey for what you get.
4,i love this show wish it never ended now i have the complete season,love it but wish it was in widescreen havent seen it in years its just great one of those showes ill watch over and over again
4,Gift for my wife,"I bought this DVD as a gift. DVD is not digitally remastered, so quality isn't great, but it does contain all the shows episodes, including the shows not available through Netflix on demand."
4,How and why we Age...,I work in the field of biochemistry and this theme allways poped up in my mind since I was a teenager. Its is written in simple words so that anyone with interest in biogerontology and in the mechanism of ageing can understand. Dont fe fooled by the fact that it was first published 1994 because good science doesn't have age. The book was in god shape and well presented
3,memories,"I bought this CD, not just to include it in my collection, but because the song ""Midnight and you"", made a man out of me one night"
3,Nice book,"The story, characters are excellent. I liked the book.However, the spelling and use of the wrong word was on every other page. I just found it hard to believe that this book could get published without having someone proof read it first."
3,Disappointing - Needed More Practical Tips,"I was hoping for more. There were the basics: play peek-a-boo with your baby, try to be silly with your kids, tell jokes, etc. HOW? I've never had a great sense of humor and I've always hated that. I've always wanted to develop my sense of humor but never knew how. I definitely don't want my kids raised that way, so I was hoping for some tips. Unfortunately this book didn't help me. I thought it weighed too heavily on the research (yes, okay, humor is environmental rather than genetic) and not enough on activities I can do with my kids to help them develop a ""good"" sense of humor."
5,Our Pummeled Kids,"Our world is ravaged by conflict and our kids are bombarded with stress. Parents are completely frazzled. Dr. Franzini's book is a wonderful antidote to all the stress because it addresses those quiet, marvelous moments we all share with the children in our lives--moments when you catch your breath and think, wow, surely there is hope for this tattered world after all. Humor serves as our deep connection to each other and if we can instill the ability to appreciate humor in our kids, we certainly must. This book will help everyone!"
2,Not what I expected.,"The cover and title of ""Kids Who Laugh: How to Develop Your Child's Sense of Humor"" really appealed to me, but the book was a disappointment. Didn't really deliver what the title promised."
4,Good Product,"Product quality was excellent, my only issue was the time between the placement of the order and the time it was actually shipped. The wait although within the timelines given was still too long."
3,Ads on the dvd,"The first part of the dvd is an ad for Billy Blanks web site and the things he offers there. You cannot fast forward of skip this, so you have to listen to it every time you run the dvd. It's not long, but it really makes me mad that I don't have the option of skipping it. By the way, be careful if you buy from Billy Blanks web site, read the privacy policy. His privacy policy made me decide not to buy from his web site."
2,eh,I really did not enjoy this as much as the cardio fat blaster and the fat blasting bootcamp...kind of boring
2,"Decent light, but...",Just beware that these lights can get very hot if left on for more than 30 min. Might want to consider the lower voltage option for under your wood cabinets.
3,Perhaps Better Options,"I do like this in my Toyota Tacoma. However, the CD's fit loosly (maybe for easy access to them?) and if it was not for my visor being contoured into a defined spot in the headliner the CD' would go flying out on a turn to the left. If my visor is down it does happen, can damage the falling CD's, and could cause an accident if you tried to catch them in a turn. It looks nice and fits the visor well. The zippered pocket is useless for me but maybe not for others. Good price."
2,Not made by Caselogic,"I received and noticed it wasn't made by Caselogic.Looks similar in product photo, but no Caselogic logo and quality wasn't good.Feels cheap and CD pockets were all wrinkled and uneven."
3,Not bad for price,"This is Ok for big vans and SUVs, not for sedans and smaller cars. Does not fit very well on the visor."
2,crap,"The sleeves are loose!!! Its not as secure or tight as you would imagine. One time, the CD almost made it out the window!!!!"
2,Cheap...,From the picture I thought it had a zipper pocket. Probably should of read the description better. Not the best quality.
3,Decent,"This case worked well for about 6 months then the sleeves started to get loose. I would make a turn and cd's would fly off the thing!Expected life span of this cd holder, 6 months!"
5,Rabbit Feeding and Nutrition,This is by far the best book I've read on feeding rabbits correctly. The information is geared towards those breeding rabbits for show and meat production.I highly recommend this book to those who are raising rabbits commercially and are interested in increased production and health of the rabbit herd. The information given is very useful for eliminating guesswork and confusion about what to feed for best desired results.I do not think this would be useful to pet rabbit owners.
5,Cheeke has produced a research masterpiece!,"Peter R. Cheeke has done a terrific job in condensing his and a great deal others' research into a book that serious rabbit breeders will consult for generations to come.It must be noted that this book is not going to be an easy read for many people - particularly non-native English-speakers. Still, it is worth every effort you will make for this is the best available source of detailed information resulting from years of painstaking research.Serious raisers will likely also want to subscribe to a bi-monthly internet publication at prma.org and to Rabbit Habit Weekly at rabbitfarming.com.Two other books make excellent companions to Rabbit Feeding & Nutrition - Rabbit Production; Rabbit Farming Manual (available only direct from publisher at rabbitfarming.org).Cheeke was a co-author on Rabbit Production.Again, Rabbit Feeding & Nutrition is a must read for commercial rabbit producers."
4,wonderful debut from an excellent group,"This, Garmarna's debut, showcases the acoustic Nordic folk music of their roots. The groups playing is excellent, and on the few tracks where Emma Hardelin lends her vocals, the singing is raw and full of passion yet still eerily beautiful. All of the music exudes an atmospheric melancholy that probably comes from not getting enough sun, and the moodiness is captured affectingly by the players and singer.On the whole, an excellent little album full of wonderful music. For the price, it's highly recommended."
2,Not what you expect,"A well acted dive into strange, disjointed mixtures of time travel, androids, love stories, bad guys, and saving the world by sheer luck and strangeness, this may drive you crazy. If you use the English subtitles you swear that they must not be translating all of it, but the people who actually listen to the Chinese dialog swear that the subtitles are good, and that the dialog is meant to be strange and confusing.About one third of the people who watch it love it, about one third like it, and one third are confused as all get out when it is over.See which group you belong to."
4,a great children's bible,"My 9 year old loves this bible. We also bought one for our 6 year old and hopefully, when she is a little stronger in her reading ability, she will love it as well. I enjoy reading this, too. The New Living Translation is an easy read, and easy to follow. The added ""clickers"" are great, too, they are helpful and interesting. We found these in the hospital rooms at our local children's hospital. This would make a great gift for children ages 5-any age."
5,Very Good Book,"Very Good Book, filled with very interesting knowledge about nutrition and medicine from slavery days to the present, I guarantee there is something you will learn from this book...actually take notes there is so much in it I can write another book from it! Very good reading, more people need such enlightenment, perhaps we'd take better care of ourselves"
5,It just sings,"In this poignant and funny coming of age story set in early 1960s New York City, J.F. is sixteen, but not beautiful. Her mother calls her ""Jacqueline"" and says she dresses like a cab driver. Her father is mostly ""In Conference"". J.F. is forced to visit a therapist whose office smells like bananas. She smokes too much and is bored by life until two things happen.One, she falls in love with her English teacher, a pale, shy man working on a thesis about an obscure English poet. Two, her best friend gives her a harmonica. J.F. concocts a theory about her teacher's poverty and decides to help him by playing the harmonica in the street to raise money to send him to England. But, of course, disaster mostly results. It's lovely. It's about coming to terms with yourself, marching to the beat of a different drummer and doing your own thing. It's about the music you make yourself and carry with you throughout life."
2,Conflicted:Not Sure it was NEW,"I love this music. I bought two of these CD sets, one for myself and one for my brother. Both arrive on time. Nether set had the plastic wrap you always see on new CDs. I am very concerned that I paid for NEW CDs and was sent USED CDs. Also the plasic jewel case on my set was cracked on delievery. I don't know why there was not sealed plastic on either of the 2-CD sets I bought. The set I gave my brother was a gift and I'm embarrassed that he likely thinks I sent him a USED CD set."
4,Great,The book arrived as quickly as I expected. The book was in great shape and was truly a fantastic read.
3,Ok,This was not the best book for me. It was okay and I found it semi interesting. The storyline was good and it was a surprise to find out who the stalker and killer was. I liked it
5,Excellent VB/COM Book. A must for any Enterprise Developer.,"I have been working in the arena of enterprise development with VB for about 2 years now. I have had to read A LOT of C++ documentation/manuls to get an understanding of COM. This book helped to bring the information that I got from those book and manuals into the VB light. Ted does an excellent job in telling you what COM expects and how VB delivers it. Gaining the knowledge of what is actually going on, has helped to open my eyes and make me a much better COM developer."
3,"Good solid book on VB and COM, but needs some improvements","Overall, I liked this book. It's a very clear explanation of how COM works in VB. I also enjoyed reading about some of the things that VB hides from the developer when developing a component. However, I wished there were more diagrams to visually explain some of the concepts that the author describes. I also was left ""hanging"" in spots - i.e. I was asked to reference other material for more information when I felt that it was more than appropriate to delve into those details in the book.I would give this book 3 1/2 stars if I could. It's definitely a good book, and I hope that if there's another edition, the author spends some time making some of the descriptions clearer."
4,Good Book,"This book is a good introduction to programming COM-objects in VB. Easy to read and good explanation of complex topics. Four and not five starts because of: 1) To little information about persistence. 2) Pattison describes how things works rather than show you. The book contains very little code.However, the CD is a good complement to the book. HTML version of the book on the CD."
5,A must have book for Visual Basic Programers writing COM,The best book that I've read on how a Visual Basic developer should use COM/DCOM and MTS. The book goes into great detail and explains how COM works in Visual Basic. Ted's book has now become a required reading at our company!
3,What a disappointment!,"After reading all those glowing reviews I bought this book. What I found is: 1. No sample code. 2. The theories and ideas are floating all over without providing an understanding what it is all about. 3. The first five chapters you can skip. I guess that some VB programmers want to prove that they are not ""naive VB programmers""."
3,Why publish a review?,"I browsed through the reviews couple of days ago and today again. I was unpleasently suprised that some of the bad reviews disapeared and were replaced with good reviews. Is this a new policy of Amazon.com to entice potential customers to buy ths book? I was ready to buy this book, but I won't buy it now!"
1,This book has left me more confused than when I started,"According to the title, this book focuses on COM in Visual Basic, but the author spends many pages using Java to illustrate his points. I am a learn-by-example programmer, and this book is seriously lacking in examples. He refers to the ""naieve VB programmer"" who understands little about the interface between the COM object and Windows. Well, I'm proud to say that I am one of those ""naieve VB programmers"" who cares little about the behind-the-scenes operations, and just wants to know ""How do I do X ?"" I think I'm going to return this book and pick up ""Distributed COM Application Development Using Visual Basic 6.0"" by Jim Maloney. This is the second time I've been let down by Microsoft Press."
3,Esoterica of COM,More of esoterica of COM than real COM. How can anyone believe that he gained anything after reading this? My solace is in having picked up some computer buzzwords.
5,Congratulations to Mr. Pattison,It is refreshing to see that this excellent book is being used to transform the lives of convicts in an attempt to turn them into productive COM developers. I don't think that one prisoner's bad review should cast a bad light on this excellent rehabilitation program. Kudo's to the administrative staff at Shawshank for instituting this innovative program.
3,"This book is OK, could have been better.","This book received a high praise from Don Box (one of the reason why decided to read it). I was expecting tons of hints on distributed apps development, but found only a handful.Anyway Pattison's writing style kept me going till the last page of the book.First four chapters of this book is a waste, any COM book will provide that information."
3,A little misleading,"Overall a good book. However, don't get confused when explanation of class-based programming vs. interface/concrete based programming is given. ASP doesn't recognize interface/concrete based programming as indicated in the book."
2,Lang's weakest noir,"The Blue Gardenia is a rather disappointing noir from Fritz Lang, and easily the weakest of his tabloid trilogy (Gardenia, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt and the superb While the City Sleeps). It lacks the guts to really go for the jugular and the set-up is pure production line stuff - watchable but forgettable, with Raymond Burr's seduction technique leaving the only lasting impression. It's hard to get excited by Kiino's DVD either - no extras and an acceptable but far from outstanding transfer."
3,Blue Gardenia - the movie,"This is the story of telephone operator Nora Larkin (Anne Baxter), who is rejected by her paramour who is in Korea with the army. After the letdown, she goes on a date with her boss, Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr) who gets her drunk in order to take advantage of her. As a sideline from managing the telephone exchange he gets operators to pose for him as an artist. Larkin is accused of killing Prebble as she attempted to defend her honour. Enter columnist Casey Mayo (Richard Conte) who, in order to get a story, convinces Larkin to confess all. But all is not as it seems and there are still a couple of surprises in store. Nat `King' Cole makes a welcome live appearance as the lounge singer/pianist of The Blue Gardenia nightclub, singing the title song (accompanied by the ever-reliable but discreetly invisible Nelson Riddle orchestra) and we get to hear the tune twice more on disc. This is an entertaining film noire, which was directed by Fritz Lang."
2,Falls short of classic film noir,"The DVD transfer is second rate. Some of the scenes appear washed out and much of the grey detail has been muddled over. This film would rate higher if someone had worked to restore the picture before putting it on DVD.This movie, marketed as film noir, falls far short of the mark. Yes, there is a murder and there is a mystery but the plot and screenplay keep the veiwer rather bored. The best view of ""The Blue Gardenia"" is that it is also a woman's picture with Anne Baxter as the disillusioned heroine and murder suspect. Anne does a nice job here but it is the overall production that keeps the film from being rated higher.Recommended to: Hard-core noir fans who want to see all films in that genre, fans of Anne Baxter or those looking for films about women."
3,Very good Noir Murder Drama by Fritz Lang,"The Blue Gardenia is a really good film noir/murder drama with Norah Larkin (Anne Baxter) being unable to remember if she killed Harry Prebble(Raymond Burr). She cant recall if she did - but all the clues point to her direction as if she did.Richard Conte is the newspaper journalist and George Reeves is a Police Captain in this and both are great in their roles as well. Directed by Fritz Lang who gave us M , Metropolis and other outstanding films.Easily recommended to fans of Noir, Lang, Baxter, Burr,& Conte... and Nat King Cole fans as well since he appears singing the song Blue Gardenia. To me it is a solid 3.5 because there are , at least in my opinion, better movies of this sort like the Glass Key and Blue Dahlia. That being said it is a solid movie with great performances by all."
3,Fritz Lang Lite -- more murder mystery than noir,"No doubt hoping that a title reminiscent of the Alan Ladd/Veronica Lake hit The Blue Dahlia (itself a knockoff of the notorious 1946 Black Dahlia murder in L.A.), the minds behind this movie set Fritz Lang to directing Anne Baxter, Raymond Burr and Ann Sothern in this tame but stylish and watchable thriller. Baxter, on the rebound, agrees to date the boorish Burr. Having drunk lagoons of Zombies at the Polynesian palace that gives the film its name, Baxter tries to fend off Burr. When he's found dead, she remembers nothing.... Fans who know how shocking Lang's The Big Heat still is will find this entry rather tepid, but it's an effective murder story, with half a dozen moments of stunning noir photography and, better yet, with Ann Sothern as Baxter's roommate, smoking a cigarette with rubber gloves while she scrubs the dishes."
3,The (nonexistant) Black Dahlia connection. . .,"I just wanted to clarify some inaccuracies put forth in a couple previous reviews:1) ""The Blue Dahlia"" was released on April 19, 1946.2) Elizabeth Short's body was found nine months later, on January 15, 1947. It is most commonly believed that she was nicknamed the ""Black Dahlia"" by a sensationalistic press looking for a catchy nickname. It is probably a reference to both the Veronica Lake film, and the fact that Beth had a fondness for black clothing.3) This film, ""The Blue Gardenia"" was not released until 1953, and really has nothing overtly to do with the notorious unsolved murder of Beth Short. However, I CAN see where the filmmakers may have slightly exploited the fact that the Black Dahlia had seeped well into America's collective unconscious by then.Anyone interested in the facts and theories surrounding the Black Dahlia case would do better to consult www.bethshort.com or to read John Gilmore's book ""Severed"", available right here at Amazon!"
2,Be Forewarned.,"Having seen and enjoyed most of Fritz Lang's movies from his Berlin period, I bought this highly recommended DVD sight unseen. It was a great disappointment. Where to begin? The story is weak and predictable; the dialogue is very cliched; the acting--excepting Raymond Burr's wonderful performance as a sleazy artist--is unconvincing. Don't expect what the DVD label tells you--this is no ""noir thriller"" and it doesn't do anything to expose McCarthyism, despite Lang's pretentious comments. One nice touch: there is a brief 5 minute scene with Nat King Cole singing ""Blue Gardenia"" in what was becoming a new trend in early 1950's America: a Chinese restaurant. As a period piece, this film has some merit, but don't expect a well crafted noir film like the ""Maltese Falcon"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", or even ""M"" or ""Dr Mabuse""."
3,blue gardenia,I thought this was a fairly good film. The surpise ending was a treat. i particularly enjoyed the performances of Anne Baxter and Anne Sothern
5,Relativity in plain English,"If you want a phisically meaningful idea of the theory of relativity focused on invariants and fundamental principlesthat keep up holding in the ""new theory"" (e.g. the principle of momentum conservation) this is a great book.If you want really to study hard this subject after this book you could buy ""Gravitation"" by the same authors (+ thorpe)"
4,Spacetime Physics,"This book is very thought provoking, and also somewhat difficult. It requires a great deal of time to digest the contents, but worth it to help one understand the world."
5,Spacetime physics,"A must for everyone who really wants to penetrate the mysteries of Einstein's special relativity. In my opinion the principal merit of the book is an special emphasis on the intuitive space-time concept with a very simplified mathematical presentation, all without lessening the subject. Few maths needed. Generously illustrated ! Many conceptual questions make one think hard. Also many problems with solutions( Odd numbers only ). One ends with a firm grasp on special relativity. A very amazing book !!"
1,Paper Good - Packing/Shipping Bad,"Like the paper, we've been using it for years and like the quality. Unfortunately every ream of paper was split open because of poor packing of the items. Will not order from this vendor again."
4,This Sparrow Soars,"Mark Anders came home from the trenches in France during the 'War to End All Wars' only to find himself in several larger battles. Wilbur Smith pulls us into the story, as well as the continuing Courtney saga, and brings us into South African history in an interesting and informative manner. Let's face it, Smith can tell a great action/adventure story but who would have thought he could hit an environmental nerve with his lead characters working to save the wildlife and protected areas around Chaka's Gate?It's obvious Smith loves Africa and he helps many of us see why with his books. His immense respect for the Zulus shines through as well.A good read, especially when you start with the first book of the Courtney series and see how the generational tales offer hours of great reading."
5,The hardest Smith book for me to locate.,"I am a big Wilbur Smith fan.This book and the other 20+ books that Wilbur Smith has written are incredible. I have a website dedicated to Smith at www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/wilbur.html If you are a big fan also please visit, and make sure you e-mail me. Use capital A's in the web address please"
4,ANOTHER COMPELLING SMITH NOVEL,Another very interesting story about the Courtneys and Africa. Smith's ability to keep you entertained is legendary and the historical perception makes it more readable. A must to read.
5,A rarified glorious read,"If you're a Wilbur Smith fan, then this third installment of the Courtneys of Africa is right up your alley. With his descriptive style Smith takes you back to the Africa of the early 20th century where you can see the Zulu warriors, hear the lions and leopards roar and smell the expensive purfumes on the society women. I would, however, highly suggest you read the first two books in the trilogy before tackling this one (BTW: They're just as awsome) as the plot flows straight through the first and second volumes and picks up with the first page of A Sparrow Falls. I would rate this series up there with the best I've ever read."
4,Solid,"Yet another fantastic Wilbur Smith book. Not quite as good as When The Lion Feeds, or The Sound of Thunder, but still a great book. The only issue with this copy is there are no chapter numbers, I dont know why they would have been removed, assuming they are in the original. But still very enjoyable, even though it moves slightly away from the Courtney's."
4,"Excellent History of the XJ Series I,II,III Cars","The history of a Jaguar model is once again penned by the deft hands of Nigel Thorly. This book describes in detail all three series of the XJ cars, their racing history (yes, they have one), and how to select and restore a car.This book only covers Jaguar XJ6 and XJ12 cars from the early '70s through the late '80s. Many of the newer Jaguar XJ cars badged with the XJ6 are of the XJ-40 or revised variety. It is easy to spot a model covered by this book. Simply look for the dual-fuel tank fillers, one on each side of the trunk.The only disappointment in this book was the minimal coverage of the XJ6C and XJ12C models. These two-door coupes were produced in very small numbers, and few of them remain."
1,Superbly detailed review of the evolution of the XJ Jaguars,"Unlike other books about the Jaguar XJ Series, Thorley's goes into detail about colour schemes, changes in options, pricing, and all the other details about the XJ that an enthusiast might want to know. Interested in whether a UK-Spec Sovereign had the same seats as a US-Spec Daimler Vanden Plas? Thorley will tell you. Curious about whether Silver Frost Metallic was offered on 1985 cars? Thorley will tell you. A superb reference for XJ fanatics, and much more detailed than the other XJ books by Skilleter and Robson"
1,Not happy with Citronella Candles,"I had a lot of trouble with these burning evenly and the wick would burn out. I've had absolutely no trouble with the white candles at all and I will go back to them. It's made me a little skeptical of the Beeswax candles and I'll stick with the ones I know I can depend on. I will never buy the Citronella candles again. Other than this, I love my UCO lanterns and Candliers. They don't blast you with excessive light and offer what I love most about the woods, relaxation."
3,Reccomend this for long burning but not the insect repelling.,"I've tried out the one of the candle, like it said it's long buring and actually in cold weather and no wind situation, it burns slightly more than 9 hours. But in order to burn long hours, it had to be in the UCO lantern's candle holder or housing. When the candle melts, it's actually contain the melted wax at the tip of the housing and the wick completely burn off all the melted wax rather than letting it drips all over the place wasting the wax. For long 9 hours burning i'll give it 5 stars, but i bought these candles for the citronella scent which is meant for repelling moz n other bugs. You can smell the scent on the candle when it's not burning, but once your light it, there's hardly any scent coming out from the candle. So just buy the normal candles or the beewax version.UCO you have to add in more essential oil for this to work."
2,Just regular candles,"I bought these candles mostly because of the seller's promise of keeping mosquitoes away, but also because they were suppose to last around 9 hrs each. What can I say? The mosquitoes had a lot of fun playing chicken between themselves flying as close to the flame as they could, without even having a sneeze. The only thing that the mosquitoes complained about was that the candles didn't last 9 hrs, but something around 5 (and I'm being generous). Our camping trip was about 3 weeks ago and I'm still scratching my bites. At least we didn't have to bring any candle leftover back home."
5,Work well,"Arrived quickly, as described & well packaged, have ordered more & will order again when needed. I highly recommend, if you have the uco candle lantern."
2,Way too small,"The picture makes it appear that the candles are pillar candles, they are very small and don't seem to work well."
4,Not to be read for entertainment,"The American Dream is another of Albee's many commentaries on our society. Albee saw that in every one of us there exists an ideal, the American dream. While this dream is different for us all, Albee felt that all of us simply expect our American dream to come true. This play examines the anarchy that can result from the realization that life just doesn't work the way we all imagine it can. Albee's goal is to make us all more aware of the way we think, so that we may alter it to be more correct and fulfilled. This play is not for a reader looking for entertainment. The lack of humanity in the play makes it a very abstract piece, obviously aimed at conveying a point rather than a story."
4,Very funny,"The American Dream is a hilarious satire of an old woman and her long suffering husband. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories of ""the theater of the absurd"""
1,It made me tear up..... out of boredom,Worst book ever. Don't even read it if you're a student at Johns Hopkins University.
3,Squirrel Paint Mixer,"It is not anything like the picture here. Only a ""squirrel fan"" at the end of a small rod. Guess it will work but hard to clean."
1,Piece of JUNK,"My parents bought this system several years ago. We use it to watch movies etc. So far we have had to send it in twice to BOSE corp for service. The unit just quits working. No sound, no dvd, no nothing. The min. charge is $165 and you have to pay for shipping. I could just go by a SONY system for the service call of the BOSE. We tired to buy quality and have been unhappy every since. BOSE should take care of customers without hurting my pocket book in this economy."
2,I'm disappointed with this product.,"My main complaint with this software is that you can't begin with a ""blank"" project. The only way to make a scrapbook page, (or any project for that matter), is to start with a predesigned project and then recustomize it to suit your needs. While there are plenty of nice fonts to choose from, I find the clip art to be very cartoonish - way too cutesy for the elegant pages I am used to creating on my own.I think this software is much more suitable for children due to the overall look of the projects. For the dedicated scrapbooker, I would suggest looking around for software that will create a more professional finished project."
1,Totally Useless!,"I thought since this was compatible with Windows XP, it would be very advanced with everything I could possible want. It isn't, it is no diffent than PrintMaster, same fonts, clipart, etc. Don't waste your money on this program. Wish I hadn't."
2,Promises More Than It Delivers,"I thought that the price was right, and Amazon always delivers in a hurry, so Igot out my credit card. I'm still happy about the price and the delivery, but the program is pretty bad.It is very slow to start up (always a problem with Broderbund software), and thetemplates are very simplistic - not at all anything I would want to send out to family or friends.On the plus side: You don't have to be a computer 'expert' to use the program,and thus it could be a very useful tool as an introduction to Digital Scrapbooking.For beginners, though, my choice would be Scrapbook Flair which is availableas a free download, and has many free backgrounds, embelishments and templatesready to download from their website.I have been really impressed with PhotoShop Elements as a very flexible tool for creating Digital Scrapbook pages.It's a lot of trouble to learn, but the results are worth it."
3,Somthing bad on my mind,"I agree with the previous review, the 1968 album Somthing bad on my mind was the best she has done. I too wish that the power's that be would release it on CD, it is so beautifull. I came across it back in the 70's in a bargan bin for .99cents and it was like winning the lottery. I do not have it anymore stupidly lending it out and never returned. Here's hoping that one day they will release it in it's entiety."
4,Very good book...,This book has definitely made me a Diane Chamberlain fan. It is the first time I've read one of her books & now I've downloaded The Secret Life of Cee Cee Wilkes which I am reading now & I LOVE. Glad my eyes have been opened to this talented author.
4,Another Winner,"I did not realize this was a trilogy, but it doesn't matter because this was a great read. I loved the character development, the location, the twists and turns and the story. I can't believe I just discovered this amazing author. I am 2 books down and about 6 to go. Keep writing and I'll keep reading."
5,A Wonderful Read,This book takes the story of Annie's daughter from Keeper of the Light and shows the after effects of secrets being exposed. It's always interesting how children turn out to be very much like the parent they don't want to be and Lacey mirrors her mother in so many ways. Am now reading Kiss River and wished I'd read it second instead of third in the story of the O'Neill family. The reading is easy and a wonderful diversion from a hectic life.
3,A Young Woman's Search for Identity,"I enjoyed this book a lot, as it dealt with the process of a young woman coming of age and trying to figure out who she is. I could relate to this struggle, as I'm quite sure many readers can. However, I find it falls short of the first book of this series about the young woman's mother; that was a richly woven tapestry with some shocking finishes and surprises all the way through. While this was enjoyable, it dulls by comparison.(NO NAME)"
2,Sun's Documentation is Better,"The goal of a programming book should be to make it easier to use the language or library. This book doesn't do that. There is no sorting of what is important and what isn't.Chapter 3, for example, is a very muddled discussion of MVC, and only confuses the whole issue of the place of MVC in Swing. The UML diagrams throughout are not very informative, either.I bought this book with the hopes that it would give me a big picture overview of swing, but instead it just gets lost in all the details. I finally bit the bullet and read Sun's Swing tutorials and documents, and found them much more informative. I wish I didn't have to read them on the computer screen."
5,great resource,"This book lays out the post modern landscape in youth ministry in a concise manner. Each chapter is presented clearly-with no wasted words. The author does not offer a bunch of answers, but invites the reader to think about the kids they serve. The fact that he resists the temptation to give us formulas for ""sure fire"" success, [haven't we heard enough of about the NEXT BIG THING?], is down right refreshing. What this book does is to present a road map of the post modern world while encouraging us to build our hope on the transcendant promises of God. Some books in this genre [Maclaren, et all] ask us to treat the faith story as a story we can manipulate until it fits our ideals. This author presents the faith story as a fixed point. Its changeless nature makes it an anchor for the soul. Great stuff."
5,Home run again,Dr. Mueller has once again combined good research with parental insights to provide a balanced view of the youth culture. He is not angry or alarmed--only passionate about a positive outcome for this generation. Must read for parents and youth workers.
1,PF9,"It says it holds a PF9, but it won't hold mine. Very disappointed. I have other FOBUS holster which I like."
5,The shining star of Mexico!,"Javier Solis remains the brightest star in the history of Mexican music. His mariachis are second to none, and his voice is unequaled. A must have CD for connosseurs of fine music."
1,Avoid this TV,"I was pretty happy with this TV while it was under warranty. The picture and sound quality were great. But not long after it was out of warranty, problems started to occur. First the TV would take a long time to ""warm up"" sometimes over a minute. Then the picture would not fill up the whole screen until after 5 minutes. Now in order to turn on the TV, it has to be restarted 6-10 times before it even gets to the ""warming up"" phase mentioned above.Now recently it started changing menu items, channels, and volume levels all by itself. Worst TV I've ever bought or owned."
4,Perspective on this book please,"The book was written in the 90s when the concept of self image in the African American community was still in its infancy, however, it speaks to some truths about who we are, how we see ourselves and how we are seen by those looking in.Some of the commentary is a bit dated, but the archival research is fascinating and informative. People not comfortable in their own skin will NOT like this book; it speaks to the reflection in all of our mirrors: be prepared to accept what you see.I enjoyed it and have recommended it to others."
3,Very interesting,This book was very interesting. However in all fairness I cannot give 5 stars. This is due to the fact that light skinned black people are glorified too much in this book. I am of light brown complexion and I do not recall ever being discriminated against because of my color. I know of many dark complexioned people who are just as successful in life even though they are dark complected. I am married to a dark skinned man who is a christian man and not a brute. He is far from it. I feel that dark skinned women should have been able to contribute to this book as well as caucasian males as well.
3,Informative,"I throught the color complex was a very interesting read. When reading books like this have to wonder, just how many people were interviewed. I asked my hundreds of relatives, both light and dark skin, and most of them said they didn't even know color was a big issue until I mention it to them. Another thing from reading this book, it makes it seem if you are light and married to a dark skin guy, he only married you because of your color, and love is not even in the equation. People always bring up the entertainment industy, to justify their point that light skin people have and advantage, but i'm thinking what's so great about that industry anyway, why not look at real life, why don't we worry more about how God see's us. Sometime I wonder if books like this don't keep the problem going on, instead of solving anything."
2,hatred of light skin blacks in Philly,"This book is mostly about hatred of darker skin blacks and preference of light skin blacks. There's a chapter about interracial dating that has nothing to do with colorism. I'm black and light(yellow)skin. I had lived in Philadelphia(ninth- poorest US city,blacks are the majority) for many years.In Philadelphia many brown skin black adults and dark skin black young adults prefer brown and dark skin blacks. Sometimes brown skin blacks date light skin blacks. I lived in cities that weren't like this.My light skin and my brown skin black young adult cousins lived in some zipcodes in Phily that have many sex offenders and none of the black men would date my light skin cousin and many wanted to date my brown skin cousin.There are few light skin black and dark skin black young adult couples in Philly."
5,You deserve to treat yourself to this excelent read.,An excelent book for anyone to get an insitful introduction to the issues of most whites and blacks. As an African American I have even learned more about myself. I enjoyed reading this book so much I wish I could read it again for the first time and then ten times more. I am in search of more books with a read like this.
1,not his best show,"this dvd wasn't what i was expecting. i thought is was the show that plays on BET often but it seems like it is an older version,"
1,"Not an Engineering Text !, meant for dummies","I would not waste your money on this book. It is very overpriced for the type of content. This is basically a dumbed-down repetition of information that is already in most popular engineering texts. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this. I actually bought a version in the 90's for about $10. I don't know why the price has increased so much. It should not be priced the same as accepted standard engineering texts.If you are doing design work, there is not much you can use from this book because all the information is very qualitative. There is a chapter about sizing nozzles and that information could have been condensed into 1 page. There is a lot of 'fluff' written around the actual engineering information presented.I'm not saying the book is bad by any means, but it does not have enough 'meat' to command the prices shown here >$70."
2,Dust leaks out too much.,"This item produces a good dust cloud, but way too much product leaks out from the air intake. Consequently, you get rotenone, or whatever, all over the place, and wastes most of the dust."
4,needs a little duct tape,"I was going to buy this from Amazon, but ran into it at a local shop for a couple of bucks less, plus didn't have to wait. It throws a nice cloud of dust, either DE or BT, but the air intake at the bottom of the hopper/turbine assembly is so open that it allows much of the dust to fall through without being blown. A small piece of duct tape on the bottom of the air intake venturi still left the side jets open, no spillage was occurring, and lots more dust was going to the plants. I feel it is a very good product, so far, have only used it for a month. Many fewer bugs, tho, and the Japanese Beetles really don't like the DE, after living thru other sprays and chemicals without much apparent effect.I would recommend this tho the light plastic and the need to think how to fix it causes me to list it as a 4 rather than a 5 star product."
2,One year life,I agree with others that the dust does not come out evenly or consistently. I have to frequently shake it to get an adequate dust stream. This is my second season and the turn handle broke this week. I'm not seeing a great alternative out there but this is too pricy for a one season product.
3,Read this to understand what you are buying.,"I first tried using it as intended by the manufacturer, but it simply falls apart, and doesn't put out a lot of powder. After giving up using the little handle I had the idea of using my air compressor. BOY! Made it awesome. I simply put the air nozzle in a little space under it and away we go. clouds of powder, 10 feet ahead. amazing! Made my life easy dusting the crawl space of my house for fleas with DE."
1,Junk,"Cheap plastic junk, more like a childs toy. Worth maybe $3.00 but not $30.00. I turn it as fast as I can and I might see a small puff of dust about every five turns. I will be sending mine back. Don't waste you money."
4,Planmates 76900 Powder Mill Dust,Very usefull dust applicator if you are applying in small areas not recommended for very large areas. Received it as described. Thank you.
1,Defective,"Ordered two - both defective.Seems that the ""worm screw"" and screen are too close together causing hard cranking. Screw may be out of tolerance and ""forced"" to fit."
3,Plastic Plastic,Product is not sturdy and does not put out dust powder effectively. Have to keep shaking it to get more powder out every time I turned the handle.
2,Not sure what to think,"Mine also seized up after 10 minutes. I took it apart and found the gears are greased and when the powder mixes with the grease and heats up it makes a paste and thats what causes them to stop turning.i used diatomaceous earth which is very fine, not sure if thats the problem. if anyone has any better to distribute DE please let me know.I'm going to clean this one and try it again dry."
1,Spreads dust well - durability unacceptable,"I've had three of these. The device does a wonderful job of spreading dust. My need is to spread dust containing Bacillus Thuringiensis (BT) bacteria (Dipel brand) for organic control of above ground destructive worms in my vegetable garden. Bought the first one last year and used it all summer very effectively. This spring, very early in the SC growing season while dusting cabbage, the handle broke while I was using the device. While this shouldn't happen, I thought, maybe I was cranking too hard. So another one was bought from a local supplier. After maybe 10 minutes use of gentle use, the mechanism seized. The second unit was exchanged for a third one, and after maybe 10 minutes use, it also seized. Will use my refund to purchase a different model.I've used Dipel BT dust for years. It has the consistency of Sevin dust. While I haven't been able to confirm whether the Dipel dust was a factor, I tend to doubt it.No more Powder Mill Dusters for me!"
3,Okay but with reservations,"I will admit a bit of fascination with human oddities. Why not? There seems to be little to be fascinated with anymore. Like the author, I also enjoyed Carnivale on HBO. I also enjoyed the old 30's movieFreaks.With this book, I was expecting more than I received. While the scope was adequate, I felt the depth was lacking. Overall, it was still an enjoyable read but each sub-section left me wanting more information about the person. The most disturbing aspect of the book was the lack of pictures. For sure, pictures were included but for many subjects, I had to do a Google image search. How hard would it have been to insert a picture for each person listed in the book? When the topic is ""human oddities"" a picture is needed in order to get a real feel of the person's challenges.Still yet, I would recommend this book to my friends; at least those know how to get Google on their computer.Michael L. Gooch, Author of Wingtips with Spurs"
4,Carny Folk,"A fascinating review of side show freaks and the more human side of their story. They seemed to hold a most non PC point of view, and some would fight for what they considered to be their rights as oposed to the rights allowed by others."
2,Very cheap and doesn't include any dye,"This is overpriced for what you get. It's pretty cheap. Although it does not include any dye, it should have a small sample of dye. In fact, I thought it came with dye but I probably overlooked that part of it. The packaging makes it appear fit for a child but dye is not."
1,"messy, slow","Messy, slow, does not do what it claims at all. Improperly designed as one review suggests (should have holes at base instead of tips), material doesn't come out easily, material is cheap. relatively easy to wash.Perhaps better if company had a demonstration video with it..."
2,Comb die,"Waste of money, do not even think about it. Cheap product. I bought two n feel like a fool now"
4,IT DOES THE JOB,"I liked the product, but I would have like the bottle a bit narrower, I don't have too much strength in my hands. I recommend it."
2,Far Below Par,"Don't waste even the small amount of money on this one. The speakers are overwhelmingly mid and low range. Our boom box has better sound than this wimpy system. The auto controls for high-low and speaker power don't change the sound or settings at all. DVD's frequently show little bits of distortion while playing. CD's frequently skip. In addition to the skipping, the player cannot play two tracks as one, as in Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" -- there is about 1.5 seconds of delay between two tracks that should sound like one, continuous song. Needless to say, we returned ours."
1,SKIPPING BAD DISK AREA,"Get used to seeing 'Skipping bad disk area' and missing huge chunks of your movie. This was my 1st DVD player so I figured I was just getting a lot of bad DVDs. I finally tried playing one in a non-phillips DVD player and it was fine. The DVD player seems to konk out after about an hour of play. The screen gets pixilated, you get the above message, and then it locks up. Customer support has told me to get lost. This wasn't the exact model I got but judging by the other reviewers this is a problem common to all Phillips DVD players.Stay away from Phillips DVD players if you ever watch movies that are over 1 hour."
1,Very Disappointed,"Bought it as a spare/cheap system for a guess room. Tested two-out-of-two DVD movies, noticed about 6 to 10 GLITCHES of white spots and lines. Tested CD-RW discs, noticed a loud pop at the beginning of almost every song. Another inconvenience is the self-powered subwoofer that has to be manually turned off when not used. ""You get what you pay for"", my husband and I agreed. Oh, when we went to return it, an employee at the store stated that he has the same system and did noticed the glitches as well, but didn't mind it... Whatever!!! I don't recommend this system, it was our first Philips brand, and now have doubts in all Phillip products as well, for putting out such a defected model. For those that own one, if you noticed the problems described, please validate our findings, to inform others."
4,Great item for a great price!,"I purchased this item when it was on sale, and I am very happy! The sound quality is great! The speakers are also very small. I have seen similiar items go for twice as much!"
2,Spoilers: goes off the rails,"This is an interesting novel almost all the way through, and then it goes off the rails:The hero has lied to the heroine, so they agree on a situation which will demonstrate that he's trustworthy. It demonstrates just the opposite and makes a fool of the heroine, but she accepts him anyway with no explanation.Another romance, which one expects to have a happy ending, ends with an act of spite by the woman. This is the second book I've read by this author that has an older woman character who seems reasonable on the surface who actually nurses vengeance for decades. That's not too appealing in light reading.The spy part of the story sort of falls apart into chaos.Plus which, there's a secondary but important character, the young French girl, who's character is never really explained. Possibly she's the moron she appears to be, but but we don't really know."
3,Not quite what I expected,"This book is not bad at all but I must say that I expected it to be more specific about the ways of the Silkroad. The author gives us information which is not very particular to this Road. The tales give a lot of Geographical info, info about Buddhism, about the way Monks live a.s.o. but this is not typically Silk Road stuff. Buddhist Monasteries and their rules are almost exactly the same anywhere, the same goes for the making of felt, the described wall paintings etc. It was also written in a very boring style but then again the author is no writer but a Scholar, so we should not be too hard on her.Christina"
2,"Interesting facts, but badly writted","This book has an interesting story being told but the way it is told is extremely boring, monotonous and meticulous."
2,creatacard,"I was very disapointed with the limited product selection. Seems like it was geared towards children, not adults. Not worth the money."
2,Not what I expected,"I have not been able to use this product. I don't find it very user friendly but I think that's because there are no instructions and I don't find it intuitive. I was led to believe that it would provide card inserts not just cards with text. So although this is probably my problem, it's still annoying."
3,feeder review,The feeder is a nice design and easy to clean. I had one that looked just like this one for about twenty years before the lids broke off. This new design has stronger lid attachment. The only problem with this new design is the timer is loud and drives me crazy. I pull out the battery when I'm not using it. Also my old one came with a cold pack and this one did not. If your pet eats wet food this would not keep it fresh. I would say it is a dry food feeder only.
3,Trays can be pulled out.,Within two days my cat figured out how to pry the bottom trays out and pop the feeder open.I used contact cement to glue the trays down and put duct tape around the edges so no glue was showing.Now it works.
3,"Good product, but too easy to open.","We bought this feeder for our rabbit, so he would get several small meals during the day while we are at work. It opened reliably and we were happy with it for about 2.5 weeks of using it. Now our bun has figured out how to open it by himself, though. And it's not only that he can open it, but he is able to do it with ONE well-placed little bite. The lid opens in less than a second of him trying and isn't even a challenge. So while this was a great idea, the manufacturers didn't take into account that a pet will try to break into it eventually."
4,Good product for dry food only,I purchased the PetSafe 5 meal with the intent of using it for wet food distribution while away on long weekends. I have 2 cats that eat wet food in the morning and snack on dry food throughout the day. I ordered the PetSafe a week prior in order to test the settings and ensure that it worked as planned. Upon my return home from a 3 day weekend I soon discovered hundreds of ants had come into my home to feast on the mound of wet food left in each tray. Not only had they covered the PetSafe feeder but also the dry food container that was sitting beside it. Needless to say my cats were very hungry upon my return with no wet or dry food to eat. The Petsafe electronic feeder is a great device if you need to feed your cat specific portions throughout the day but should not be used to provide wet food (unattended) over the course of several days.
4,"Great product, only one flaw","I use this feeder for my curious kitten! It is great because he is not able to somehow open/break it. It only took about 10mins. to figure out how to set it so I wouldn't say it is exactly user friendly. Also, you need to apply tape to the corners of the sticker located on the inside lid of the feeder or else it will not open properly. Otherwise it is easy to clean and use and much cheaper than buying in stores! Shipping was also incredibly fast which was much appreciated."
1,My Corgi broke this cheap feeder the first time,"Do not waste your money on this feeder. It is cheap plastic even though it looks sturdy in the pictures. I only used it once as my smart Corgi figured out which compartment had the food and broke it open ruining the feeder and costing me over $30.00. It is a complete waste of money. The 5 feeder one from the same company looks even cheaper. If you have a smart dog, a chewer or a bigger dog, this will not last more then a day or two. I would say it might only work for a dumb dog like a Dalmation."
1,Broke within a month,"I bought this item a month ago and it broke already. It was great while it lasted, unfortunately, that wasn't long."
1,Terrible,"Doesn't work for me at all. It will not cycle more than a centimeter at a time. I reset, changed batteries, reset, reset, reprogrammed, etc. After hours of fooling with it, I've given up."
1,Do not buy this product - I would rate it zero stars if that were an option,"I just receved the 2 meal electronic pet feeder and am so sorry I did not read the reviews beforehand. It has many flaws but mainly the timer didn't work. I tried 2 different brand new batteries and no movement. In the meantime, my cat easily figured out how to break into the product and eat both portions, one which was intended for my other cat. This is going back, don't buy it!!"
2,Broke after 2 months of use,"There is no 'battery low' indicator and no battery back up - which could leave pet unfed. Also, one side broke after 2 months of use."
1,Useless - My puppy figured it out in 2 hrs,"After much research for an automatic pet feeder, I decided on this one because of the great reviews and the brand name I trust. I purchased the feeder for my 7 month old Beagle puppy in September to use throughout the day (for her snacks) while she's home alone. Within 2 hrs of testing it, she figured out how to get to the other 4 meals. Now, 4 months later, it takes her about 2 minutes to go through all 5 trays. I regret not sending the product back for a full refund. The feeder now just sits in the corner of the house...unused."
3,"OK, but not spectacular.","This unit (we bought two) works as advertised but consider the following:1. We feed our cats three times per day. The 5 bins allow only for a day and a half before the cat(s) run out of food. If you go away for a three day weekend, the critter(s) get no food that last day. Reducing feedings to twice a day can solve the problem but it can throw off the animal's feeding rhythms. If you regularly go away for longer than three days, look elsewhere. This unit is not for you.2. The turntable scared the heck out of our cat when it turned while he was eating. Training the critter not to fear the turntable can take time.3. Wet cat food will dry out if left for a day or two in this unit. If your pet demands wet food, this unit may not work for you.Other than that, it works well, programs easily (although the instructions are unnecessarily complex) and cleans easily."
2,Feeder bins do not line up with the lid opening,"I originally purchased this product two years ago. No problem until the timer mechanism stopped working. So I ordered a new feeder. Unfortunately, the new feeder's rotating bins do not line up correctly with the lid opening (this was also the case with a product exchange). I hope my cat does not realize this and force the tray to rotate outside of the scheduled feeding times."
2,"Great Idea, Terrible Execution","I was so pumped for this thing! Day one, I woke up to find happy, fed rabbits who finally left me alone while I slept in. Day two, I set it out at night for the following morning. Barely a couple minutes later I heard a noise, looked over, and saw them happily munching away on lettuce. Oh no! I must have not pushed the lid down and set it right.So I reset it, jostled it a bit to make sure it was secure, and set it back down. A minute later, there they were again breaking into the next day's breakfast. I bought the 2 meal version and each tray has a lip that extends down front from under the lid. All they need to do is jimmy that a bit and it pulls right out from the lid. See the user photo with the cat demonstrating to you what your pet will do. If they haven't figured it out yet, it's only a matter of time. Completely useless. My trusty UPS guy came by yesterday with my label to return it. I hope I can find a version of this that actually does its job."
1,Dangerous DO NOT TRUST,Eatwell 2 meal pet feeder - Model PFD11-13706One side doesn’t open. Cat went hungry. Do not trust. Consider something else.
2,"Works okay, but some annoying design flaws","The good:*The timer is fairly precise, so you can set both containers for the same time and expect to have them actually open at the same time. That is not often the case with feeders like this.The bad:*The clock is very loud, hums non-stop and clicks at regular intervals*There is no on-off switch, so you have to pull the battery when you want to turn it off.*There is no space to fit in a cold pack, which some other feeders of this type have.*Even though pulling the battery is the only way to shut it off, there is no easy way to do so. A standard AA battery fits in very snugly, and it's a pain in the neck to remove."
2,Not what I expected,"I will say the feeders are decent but my question is with the name of the product. They state they are ""Electronic"" Pet Feeders. Where is the electronic part? The timer is a manual timer that is not very accurate and does not always work. Even once they reach hour ""0"" and the tray opens, the timers continue to go using up the battery 24/7.Purchased two and had to exchange one within the first 10 days due to the timer quiting. I will say Amazon's return/exchange process is VERY easy to use but I think I will be returning them both for a refund. Spend a little extra and get the true ""Electronic"" feeder."
2,great product but only for a short time,"I loved this feeder when I first got it. It was easy to program and my cat was unable to figure out how to get at the food. He tends to howl in the early morning and this was the trick to getting some morning sleep. Up until now, I would have given it a 5 star ratingHowever, it only lasted about eight months before the motor gradully gave out. We heard it turn in the middle of the night, but unfortunately it wouldn't turn far enough for the cat to reach the food. I thought it was just the batteries, but it turned out to be the motor.I am really bummed, since it worked so well in all other features, and now I don't really want to spend another 50 bucks for a few months of use. But I am not happy about hearing the howling again in the early morning hours... :("
3,Meets our Basic Needs,"The timer only allows you to set one time interval. So when we use this to feed the cats when we're out of town for a couple days, you have to leave one compartment empty or allow for the estra food the kitties will get. Otherwise, it meets the purpose we bought it for... prevent the cats from free feeding, eating all the food the first day, and then having nothing left for the second day."
1,Don't bother,"Don't waste your money on this product. I bought one for myself and one for my parents as a gift, and even though they worked at first, they both stopped working after a few months. The trays stopped lining up correctly and then the timer stopped working. Eventually, after about four months, they stopped functioning altogether. The digital displays flash straight lines but it's impossible to set the timer function. We changed all the batteries, to no avail. So there go one hundred dollars down the drain. Shame on the people who manufacture this product."
1,Loved it until it broke... twice,I loved this feeder until it broke. We have gone through two different units and they both had the same problem. The digital display went blank and it stopped working even after replacing the batteries. It is a real shame because it was easy to program and our cat couldn't get it open. I just can't endorse something that isn't reliable.
3,Mixed-Up Reviews,"Why are there so many reviews here for a differnent item than what is pictured? Most of the reiews here are for the rotating food feeder and not for the double pop-up food feeder. The double-food feeder lacks enough details to know how to activate it appropriately. I know that it seems easy enough for a 5 year old to figure out, except there's no direction on what to do with the black knob on the back. The wheel just keeps going and going; theres no indication to mark where to end your turning. I'm already thinking about returning this item.. just purchased yesterday from retail store. But I'll give this item at least one more attempt to see if I can get it to work right."
2,Smart Cats will literally eat this product to worthlesness,"Bought this product for a stray cat we took in that tends to cry from 5:30 to 6:00 AM. We figured it would at least feed her in the morning so that we could get some sleep.Took her less than a week to figure out how to spin the 5 tray system so she can eat all the meals. This is going back to Amazon, poor design.Get's two stars only because now the cat spins all her dishes thinking more food will appear, which I think is funny."
3,Kitty figured it out after a month,"This is a fairly well-built feeder, but it may be better suited to dogs than cats. My cat is greedy and determined, and after about a month he figured out how to pop this open with his claws."
1,Broken,"When I placed a battery in, the motor seems to work (I can hear it). However, the timer does not count down, therefore the lids do not open."
4,Eatwell feeder,The feeder is great. It is a great size for my cat's meals. It would have gotten 5 stars with a cooler pack would come with it. Seller was great and fast.
5,Just what I needed,"My cat Cornelius has this obsession with food. I cannot leave a bowl of food for him, because he will eat until nothing is left and still will ask for more. This product works great for us. First, I can control when he eats, second, I can control the portions. So far (and I had it for about a month now) there are no problems with rotation. Easy to clean too. Highly recommend."
2,Beware of smart cats,"This feeder was great at first. However, I have had this for approximately 9 months, and after about 6, one of my smart kitties figured out how to get her claws inside of the feeder, and get it to move, so she started sneaking extra meals. Upon trying to keep her from doing this (by putting gorilla tape over the edge so that she couldn't sneak her nails in between the tray and the lid), the tray occasionally became stuck and the motor died. This only happened on one of the trays (I have 2). So, if you have a smart cat, I wouldn't recommend this item."
1,product design is poor,"For about a week this product worked great and my cat was no longer waking me up at 5:00 am. But,in no time at all he is now able to pry it open quite easily as soon as I put it down. It is actually rather easy to open it regardless of setting the timer. Product is now usless to me."
5,Great for a midday dog snack!,Great product!Two large removeable cups. Great to set up for two seperate times throughout the day. I leave treats for my dog as a mid-day snack.
1,Not worth it,"It took about a day for our two cats to figure out how to open these- very flimsy in securing the food. The timers were also wildly inaccurate but seeing as how the cats knew how to break in, it didn't really matter."
5,"Great buy, I have TIPS!","1- make sure surface you put your food on is level (or the machine won't rotate all the way to the next dish)2-have your cat food around when you program this dish. i poured bits of food and rotated the machine as i set the time so that they know when the machine goes off, food is coming. i went as far as to put a couple pieces of dry food in the open slot.3-if you have something heavy on top of the lid, the wheel underneath won't rotate. (both of my cats wait for the dish, one sat on top one day and it didn't turn). maybe use electrical tape (2 pieces at the bottom to keep lid down)."
2,Smart Cats Can Figure It Out,"I purchased this for my cat, for when I'm gone for the day. She needs to eat small portions throughout the day otherwise it wont stay down. This worked great for about a week, but after that she was able to figure out how to open it up. She was able to pull on the lip of the removable tray and pull it out. I have begun making sure both halfs are closed because then she has a harder time getting it open."
2,Needs to be more dog proof,My Beagle figured out how to push to the next meal/man-handle this thing after about 5 minutes of leaving her alone with it. Good concept but needs to be toughen up a bit to prevent this from happening.
4,EXCELLENT Pet Feeder,"I bought this product for my English Bulldog puppy -4 months- and I think this feeder is an excellent idea when you have to go out and your puppy need to be feeded several times during the day. Now my puppy recognized inmediately the sound when it is... eat time.The feeder is very easy to set, so easy to clean and the plastic seems to be durable, mostly when my dog stands over it.I do really recommended this product for a small or medium dog, because the dishes - 1 cup and a half - probably would be smaller for a big dog.."
2,racoons vs PetSafe 5-meal pet feeder,"Racoons kept dragging the whole feeder away.I tried weighting it down with a concrete stepping stone -- which prevented them moving it much. But the weight apparently jammed the device, which caused the gears inside to strip out!So I bought another one, and this time I weighted it, but with the stepping stone resting only on the very back edge -- and a wall. That worked better, but eventually again stripped out again.I plan to try once more, this time screwing the feeder to a heavy board underneath. Actually, before I again ordered one, I looked in a local pet supply store for another automatic feeder. The only one in stock had its battery door on the bottom -- no obvious way to keep it safe from racoons."
4,Cat got used to it quickly...,"At first my Spencer was frightened on the first rotation. He walked up to it slowly and slapped it a few times and slapped some food around. Once he saw it didn't hit back he ate the food. He is now use to it, he runs to it as soon as he hears the sound. Only thing that sucks is in the front of the cover relase is a hole and sometimes little food will go in the hole and the cat will try to bat at it...but it's very sturdy. Sometimes when there a few pellets left, my cat will swat a food pellet one at time and eat it off the floor. I'm using Science Diet. This is a great feeder and I'm using it so my cat will eat smaller meals distributed throughout the day and night. I still feed him wet food in the morning...but this is great to auto feed during the day/evening."
2,It worked fine until it broke.,"My cat needs to eat a special diet, which entails wet food. If I feed her in the morning before I leave for work, she can't finish it all. Then the food dries out and she won't eat it later when she's hungry again. You know cats! I hoped that this pet feeder would enable me to feed her smaller amounts more frequently during the day.PROS: Easy to program. Mechanism is not too loud. Can accommodate up to 5 feeding times.CONS: Be aware that this is not refrigerated, so if you are using wet food then consider shelf life of the food. Also, after just a month of use, the unit started to rotate only part way, so that half of the feeding dish was still covered. I can't use it anymore."
2,Not impressed,"This is one of the best reviewed pet feeders that I could find, so we tried it out. It worked well for a while and then started rotating non-stop when the time to rotate hit. The problem is the catch under the food dish. It is supposed to pop up in between bowls so that it stops rotating and it apparently isn't catching anymore. Until it started doing this, it was working fine and was effective for feeding the cats once a day."
1,Pain in the ! Waste of $!,"Don't bother with this feeder unless you don't really care what time it opens. I bought this to feed 2 cats simultaneously, but the timers' accuracy is so poor that it is impossible to get them to open at the same time. The result is that the dominant cat will eat all the food when the first one opens, then the same cat will eat all the food when the second one opens (up to 45 min later!), while the meek cat starves. The thing is also so light that the hungry animals knock it all around the room, making tons of noise in the meantime. I was very disappointed and somewhat in disbelief that for a price this high, this feeder could be so cruddy!"
2,Did not last,I have had this product for 2 years and unfortunately it did not last. The mechanism now fails to rotate the tray. I tried everything to make it rotate but it won't work so now I have to buy a new feeder. This machine worked really well but unfortunately it is not durable.
5,Great Product!,My cat has trouble keeping food down so has to fed in small portions. This product works great and allows me to feed her at regular intervals during the day when I can't be home. She has gained weight and is really thriving now. Would recommend this product without reservations!
1,An electronic cat feeder got NO ON/OFF switch,"Eatwell 2 meal pet feeder- Model PFD11-13706This so-called electronic cat feeder does not have an power switch. Every time when I don't need to use it, I have to use my fingernail to get out the tightly-fitted battery, or else just to let the feeder continue to consume the battery. Getting the battery with the help of my finger nail damaged not only my finger nail but also the battery.An ON/OFF switch which, I assume, is a feature by default for any electronic applicances. Sorry it is no where from the product description that I could be informed of such operation. So you better think twice before buying this product."
2,Cat broke into it,"Like others here have commented, my cat broke into it very quickly. Not that she's particularly intelligent, just that if she wants food bad enough, and has unlimited time on her hands, she can figure it out. She popped it open the first time we left her alone with it."
1,Does not work at all,"My daughter bought it via amazon and it was not working in brand new. When you buy something, you won't expect it is not working. We could not return it within 30 days as we brought the feeder overseas to use it for our puppy during a long vacation. Waste our money."
4,"Good deal, great product!",Great product. Very simple to use and very convenient.I don't have get up at 5 am to feed my cat anymore!
4,Great Automatic Cat Feeder!,"This automated feeder has worked out wonderfully. Great product to enable your pets to be fed in small portions when you are not home, or in early am when you would like to sleep in! We have an older cat who needs to be fed in small portions, otherwise she gorges and throws up....and a second cat that will bug you in the morning to get up and feed her.........these feeders have put a stop to all of that. I fill them up once a day, and I'm done! Cats are happy! My only complaint would be that the feeders are a bit noisy when they rotate, but now that the cats realize that the noise means food is available, they run to the feeders!I also want to note that one of the feeders I bought had a defective digital clock, and the manufacturer promptly replaced it with a new unit. Excellent customer service!"
1,Don't buy it for cats,"We were sick of being woken up by our 2 young kitties, so we went to Petco and picked this auto feeder out. The design seemed simple and elegant, so we were optimistic when we brought it home. Well, to our dismay the flimsy plastic lids took the kitties about 40 seconds to figure out. With almost no effort they were able to get their paws under the lid, push, and crack both lids wide open. In no time they were chowing down, completely defeating the purpose of having the food set on timer, and to add insult to injury once they were done eating they had a great time pulling the feeding trays out of the pet feeder and spent the whole night batting the feeder and its 2 trays around the house."
2,Not robust enough for my cats,This feeder worked well for us for a while to feed our 2 cats over weekends when we were away ... but then the cats figured out how to force the rotating tray around using nose and paws. So they can now get at all the food immediately and gorge themselves.Now I'm looking for a more robust feeder for 2 audacious (and greedy) cats.
4,works really well,"Definitely worth it. It allows you to put all the food for about five days in advance. Really helpful for making sure that your pet gets fed at the same time everyday, or if you're not around for a few days. The cat I was feeding would hear the little noise the autofeeder makes, and immediately know that that's when she could eat."
2,Not worth the money,"What I really don't like about this is the dial timer. You can never set it for an exact time to get the animals used to a feeding time. Dials are not the way to go, and electronic timer with portion control is."
1,Useless cat feeder,"Just bought this feeder to help get my cat to stop screaming at me at meal time. Its worthless though! I can't get it to open with any amount of predictability - and that's what I need most. Also, the lid doesn't close tightly as another reviewer mentioned making the temptation to break in that much greater.A waste of money. I should have read these reviews first. :-("
1,Doesn't hold up to mischievous pets,"I purchased this to replace the older model of Petsafe two meal feeder, which was never perfect, and at first this looked like an improvement. It is not. Unlike the original, the timers seem even less precise, and most importantly, the timers are easily jammed by pets playing with the lids after they've opened. If your pet is like my cat, it knows there is food in this device and is going to play with it to try to get the food out, and probably disable the device in the process (ie knock the battery loose or jam an open lid against the timer, meaning kitty gets the first meal but not the second, which is what happened the first time I used it). I recommend trying to find one of the older Petsafe feeders. As I said, they werent perfect, but they worked well enough to rely on them while away for a day or so."
4,After all the searching!,"I love this pet feeder! It was very user friendly, on sale at Petsmart, and quick to set up!But there are two things that are just annoying about it! #1 The noise! When the dish turns, the noise is loud and grating! The first morning @ 4:30 I freaked out and went to go see what the noise was! After a while it's not so alarming, but it definitely wakes you from sleep and the cats definitely know when food is available!#2 is the fact that this thing takes D batteries. They are expensive and almost unneeded if there were an A/C adapter. Maybe as a back up in case power fails or cats knock the plug out.Otherwise it was a great alternative to having my kitties wake me up!!"
2,GREAT...WHEN IT WORKS!,"Our's lasted for 8 months and then the motor died right before we were going out of town. I ran to the a nearby pet store to pick up a new one. Out of the box the new one was defective. The feeder would only rotate half way and then get stuck. I ran back to the pet store, exchanged it and the new one was also defective! Same problem. So I picked up a PetSafe 2-Meal feeder and this has worked well, so far. (No motors or rotating with this one). There is a silver lining. The feeder has a one-year warranty. I called PetSafe and they sent me a new feeder, virtually no questions asked. I didn't even have to return the broken one. In summary, I'd still buy one (it seems to be one of the best feeders out there). Just keep an eye on it and have someone drop by your home while your gone to make sure it is working."
1,Not cat-proof feeder,Our three cats learned to open this feeder in a couple of months. There is too much play in the lid - allowing little claws to get under and pry it open. Not worth the money.
1,Very poor quality -- dangerous for your pet,This device is made of inexpensive plastic -- very light and easy for your pet to turn over. The battery compartment is on the bottom and has no cover so once your dog flips it over -- they could chew up the battery! The timer is not precise -- although the tops did pop open.I would not use this product with any animal.
5,Great product for cheap,"I just wanted something that I could put treats in for my dog during the day. She is home alone and gets bored around 2pm. I set this to open around that time and put in some treats that will keep her occupied. She loves it. Isn't very high tech, but it gets the job done and for cheap."
2,poor quality,I recently purchased this item and promptly returned it because it was evident that my cat could easily break into the compartments. The the flaps that cover the compartments are not tightly sealed and so my cat could pry his mouth and face into the dishes underneath. Any highly food motivated cat would break into this dish.
2,Cat figured it out.,"I ordered this product so my cat would be fed when I have to work late. Within the first 2 times of using it, the cat learned how to pry it open and feed herself when she wanted. If you have a smart pet, this won't work!"
2,Fatal design flaw... needs rotation lock when not rotating,"This feeder worked well for a few weeks, but our most agressive cat quickly learned how to turn the tray to reveal the next day's worth of food. Our cat is now fat again... moving on to another auto-feeder.If your cat is not real agressive in terms of trying to get food, this feeder will work fine (we have one cat like that... she is still skinny!). But a smart motivated cat will get to the food."
5,helping us manage a very hungry cat,"the sound of the motor that powers this feeder is music from heaven for our very hungry cat. we were resigned to getting up early for her morning feeding until someone suggested we try an auto feeder. It works great and we are slowly trimming excess weight while keeping our girl happy. The dishes are a bit deep, making it hard for her to reach every kibble. We thought this was a problem at first, but now she seems to have found a way."
4,Great way to feed pets if you are away for a short time,"This is a great way to provide measured amounts of food to cats at regular intervals. We set it to feed twice a day and it will go for two days before it needs to be refilled. My only complaint is that one of the cats is able to turn the tray and get to some of the other food in the unit. Other than that, this is a great product and a true life saver if you need to go away for a couple of days and don't want to leave a giant mound of dry cat food for your cats."
2,Good...for a year,"If asked a year ago, I would have said that I love this feeder. However, it recently stopped turning. I tried replacing the batteries and resetting the clock and feeding times. I contacted the company and was told they would happily replace my faulty device...for $58!!! Ridiculous customer service and a product that lasted only a year...not worth the money."
1,total junk,This doesn't work at all. From the first day it hasn't opened on time. After the very first opening of the compartment it hasn't closed flush so the cat can see and smell her food and forces it open. Don't waste your money!
4,"Decent product, works for short trips","I looked at all the reviews for other feeders, and this one fit my price range the best to afford 2. I was worried our super mischievous cats would figure out how to break in, they certainly clawed the outside enough, but never broke in. I also didn't like that the 1st tray is open- so basically a wasted slot if your going out of town, and one of your cats eats everything immediately on site. The other downside is that its plastic, which cats can be highly allergic to, so we would never use this longer than 3 days in a row. I wish manufacturers would get with the system and offer non-plastic options! But it suited our needs for a short weekend out of town."
5,"Great, reliable, sturdy pet feeder",I use this to feed my cat her medicine at the same time twice daily. It works reliably and it was fairly easy to program. The only cons I see are the size (it is very large!) and it is a bit noisy when it turns to feed. I would definitely recommend this!
3,petsafe 5 automatic feeder,This is pretty good and easy to program.The only problem is it sometimes does not rotate all the way to the next bowl. I will be keeping an eye on that to see how it goes.
1,Stopped working after a month,I had read other reviews that stated this product stopped working but I was hopeful that it was not the norm. Well it worked great for one month and now has stopped working. Of course this is several days after the warranty expired. Do not purchase unless you feel comfortable going away not knowing for sure if your pet will be able to have access to the food you left.Update--the manufacture kindly replaced with an new item--which stopped working after six months. Do not purchase or trust this product. Basically the timer they use is a cheap plastic piece that is not reliable. This is not acceptable when we are speaking about a pets dinner being served while we are away--where is the trust in this product when that is exactly what you want for you pet.
4,The dog gives two paws up...,"I bought this item a couple weeks ago and as of today it is working fine. I decided to get this because I am feeding my dog 1/2 a cup 4 times a day, because she was eating 1 cup twice a day, but 12 hours was too long for her to go in between meals. So, I needed something that would make the new schedule possible. I am not always at home all day, and one of those never ending pet food dipensers was out of the question, as she would eat and eat.I was concerned upon reading the reviews as some people say their cats managed to break it, so I was wondering how it work on a dog that is ""very excitable about her food"" (to put it nicely). So far, she has not tried to chew on it or do any damage. So it really is a handy tool. Hopefully it will last for awhile.The bowls are somewhat small, but they do hold at least 1 cup of food per bowl. All-in-all so far, so good. And my dog is quite pleased with being fed every 6 hours now."
3,"Sturdy & Reliable, but Cumbersome","I recently purchased two of these feeders - one for each cat.Good:* They work just fine, and the cats cannot push the feeding tray around to get to the hidden food.* The timer is digital and you can set precise feeding times.* The tray can easily be removed & washed in the dishwasher.Not so good:* The buttons on the control panel have meaningless symbols, and I find that I have to refer to the paper instructions each time I use the feeder in order to set it properly.* Each feeder requires four ""D"" batteries. Our old feeder ran on a single 9-volt. Also, the battery compartment is quite poorly designed - it is difficult to insert/remove the batteries.Overall: Sturdy & reliable, but unwieldy. Would probably look at other options before purchasing again."
5,PetSafe5-Meal Electronic,It took my cat only 4 days to figure out that the noise meant food. Now she no longer wakes me up at 4:30 AM for food! It is cute to see how she sits by the dish to wait for the next meal. I love this PetSafe 5-Meal Electronic Pet Feeder!
4,A life-saver,"I used to have an analog timer feeder, which not only was not exacting in time, but was subject to abuse by my cats, who would push it around the kitchen, flip it over, or actually turn the dial to open it before breakfast. Because my cats expect their breakfast at 4:30 (and will wake me up if it's not at the ready), I needed something that would be precise and sturdy. Digital it was!This feeder has thus proved a life-saver, not just so that I can sleep regularly, but so that when I have someone feed my cats when I'm away, they can prepare a few meals in advance. They're very sturdy, so there's no chance my cats can up-end them, and the digital timer is exactly what I needed.As others have noted, the motor is very loud, and sometimes wakes me up. However, if I wear earplugs to bed, it is fine. And, of course, this all depends on how far away your bed is from the feeder.Highly recommended."
1,It was nice... at first.,"I would give glowing reviews to this contraption, as it did exactly what we needed it to do and the cat quickly came to associate the sound of the bowl turning with Food Time. He never did figure out how to get it to turn at off-times, and he's pretty smart. On the other hand, I'm giving only 2 starts because IT BROKE after 6 months of totally normal usage. Tried replacing the batteries and that didn't help at all. Very disappointed.((REVISION)) - We thought that the first one breaking after 6 months was a fluke, and bought a second one, because our 18 year old cat bugs us mercilessly if we try to go a full night without giving him a fresh can of food. We've had it for 2 months this time, and it broke. Of course. Tried changing batteries and it still doesn't work. We're upset with Amazon for selling such a shoddy product (we did get it directly from amazon), and shame on us too for giving it a second chance."
4,Serves the Purpose,"It serves the purpose and it's still working. The cats took to it immediately, but I only use it when I'm away for a day."
4,Love it!,"Got the feeder recently and so far so good. When I first filled the chambers, my 6 month old kitten went to town (he could smell the food). He was sitting on the machine, pawing at it with his claws and biting it. No damage was done! The noise scares him a little but I take him over and show him there is food. Only had it a day but its amazing! I'm going to use it when I go on an over-nighter as he chows his meals in one setting. I'm going to feed him is breakfast out of the open chamber then give him dinner, 9 pm snack, breakfast and dinner. Hope this product continues to hold up. He seems determined to get inside! The only reason it got 5 starts is because I wish it had about 2 more chambers."
5,Great for diabetic animals,"Bought this product because I have a diabetic dog that I have to feed small daily meals to. I cannot be home every four hours and thought this would work. It does!!!! Setting the timer for the feedings is very easy. It works on time and isn't as loud as people claim it to be. My dog was a little scared of the product the first day, but next day was eating out of it. My dog even runs to the feeder when he hears it moving to the next feeding.Holds 8oz of dry small kibbles of dog food in each feeding.GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Got our cats off our backs!!! Also saved us on short vacation,"Wow, what a great product. We bought it 2 months ago before a Yosemite trip. At first, the noise made them suspicious, now they KNOW what it means. ""time to eat"" You can feed the cats different times up to 8 times a day. We opted for once a day for the trip, and filled it to the brim. Along with 3 kitty litters, and multiple bowls of water, we saved time and money and energy from having a pet sitter (even if it is a friend) ON a daily basis, I set it for 3 times a day, because of their constant ""hounding"" me for food. Has worked perfect so far. Fantastic product."
3,I wish my cats liked them....,"These seem like a great item but unfortunately my cats were TARRIFIED of them, now one of my cats is kinda afraidy cat so I expected it a little but my other cat was afraid of it also, so if you know that your cat has a tendency to be afraid of sudden noise's or movement I would not recommend this. It was a little loud but only for the moment when it's turning to the next bowl."
5,Great cat feeder; not so smart cat,"This automatic cat feeder works exactly as it says it does. It's easy to program and the timer is accurate. It's a little noisy when it turns to the next space, but it only lasts for a second. Plus, it serves as a cue that dinner is served. Unfortunately, our cat who is on a diet and fed 2x per day at 7 am and 7pm, has not quite realized that we don't get up and feed him every morning - the dish does. So he is still meowing at us starting at 6 am. Or maybe he is just smart enough to know that we are still the ones to fill the feeder with food..."
1,Don't waste your money,"This product is dumber than most cats, is rather noisy, fails as soon as the warranty expires, and PetSafe will not respond to your inquiries.As others have noted, cats will soon discover how to get into the next compartment by forcing the tray around. The motor makes a rather loud and obnoxious sound as the tray advances; we moved the feeder into another part of the house rather than our adjoining bathroom: it helped but did not eliminate the noise. The electronic controller failed after just 13 months, locking the motor into a continuous ""advance"" mode. The controller also does not have any sort of memory back-up, requiring that the whole feeding sequence be reprogrammed whenever the 4 D-cell batteries are changed. And when we sent e-mails through the PetSafe Web site, asking for help with the failed controller, we never received a response.$50 is too much to pay for a product that barely makes it past a year."
5,Me and the cat love this...,"Azriel the Cat LOVE the fact that when she hears the motor spin, she gets fed and that she get fed the same time every day. I love the fact that I only have to deal with fill up the feeder once every other day and that it fit PERFECT in my kitchen."
2,Not precise or durable.,"The timers aren't exact at all and when I tested the 2 sides, they opened at different times. Over all they use cheap lightweight plastic and it doesn't seem like this will last. This may be fine for a cat or very lazy or passive dog, but we left this on the floor and our dog was trying to break into it. Also, he was waking up crying for food every day at 5:30am exactly, so we wanted this to open before he did so. The timer just wasn't precise enough and ended up just crying near the bowl. Recommend something you can set on the counter with a chute down to the bowl, etc and exact timer ."
2,NOT good for multiple days,"First off, instructions were not in the box. I don't have internet where I live so I was not able to download the instructions.We got this feeder to be able to feed our cat for multiple days. I set the program for 7am and 7pm and set all the timer slots. My mistake, (I think) is that I set all 9 time slots. Well, there are only 5 food slots. We tested with small 1 minute increments to be sure it was working and it seemed ok. I left for three days and when we returned, we discovered that she hadn't eaten in THREE DAYS. The device was moving but bypassing the next full bin of food and landing on an empty.There is no setting for a day of the week so if you plan to use this for multiple days DO NOT BUY THIS FEEDER!"
5,Life Saver!,"My cat has been on a diet imposed by his vet for the last three years, and ever since then, he whines for food incessantly. Before I purchased this feeder, I couldn't sleep late because he would pester me to feed him, and, whenever I got home from work he would cry for dinner...even when I was home hours early! The feeder took the delivery of food out of my hands. It has significantly reduced his crying. I set the bowl for feed him once in the morning and once in the evening. It is very convenient and easy to use. Would definitely recommend it for anyone with a cat who is struggling through a diet. A MUST HAVE!!"
1,Didn't work,"I was excited to try this product but in the end it didn't work. The tray would rotate perfectly fine if I pushed the ""manual feed"" button but when set to the timers for whatever reason it just would not work. Not sure if the tray was getting stuck on something or what - but I ended up returning the item."
5,"Geritol, it makes your blood run good!","If you want my opinion, this is the greatest movie of all time. It's better than the Godfather, Citizen Kane, and Casablanca will ever be. The plot and acting is spellbinding and no one actor is better than the other in Robert Redford's best film."
3,Great Film but Non-Anamorphic DVD,"This fine movie has been on my shelf for years. Every time I watch it I regret that it was not anamorphically processed. I guess Buena Vista has the DVD rights to the film. I keep hoping they'll re-release it in anamorphic (unlikely) or Blu-ray (probably out of the question).The movie itself is excellent, albeit quite long. The cast and screenplay are both on a very high level. One cannot fail to be moved by Paul Scofield's heart-breaking reaction as his son, Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) confesses to him that he was also given the answers to the contestant's questions on the Twenty-One program.The line that stays with me the longest is that of the CEO of the program's sponsor, very well played by Martin Scorsese, to Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the federal investigator: ""You have to understand that the public has a very short memory,"" he says with a grin. ""But corporations, they never forget."""
4,Quality depiction of a true story...,"Quiz Show is the true story of a game show scandal in America during the 1950s. As described in Amazon's review, Charles Van Doren is a man who receives the answers to the game show Twenty One in order to win and boost ratings.Quiz Show is an impressive representation of a true story, showing how Americans in the '50s want someone to love and take under their wing, no matter how they got there.Ralph Fiennes leads a cast of unknowns, but they are very good in producing a very interesting film under the guidance of director Robert Redford.One of the most suprising films you could see, as it is much better than it looks. If you enjoy a good story, or have an interest in the real-life scandal, then I strongly recommend Quiz Show to you."
5,that was pretty good,"wow, that amazing. the story of a corrupted entertainment world and the gullible public victims. Not a lot of movies come close to this level of drama and human nature. The story of men's rise to the top and falling back down, but being caught in the net and then letting go of the net and falling the rest of the way so he can get back up again. A very modern but timeless story that's ripples can still be seen in the hearts of the now untrusting public."
2,"Great movie, awful DVD","I would have given this DVD only 1-star, but the movie is so good it earns 2. The picture quality on this set is just awful. It's non-anamorphic and has black bars not only on the top and bottom, but on the sides as well. What you get is what looks like a zoomed out picture that is also fuzzy. There are no bonus materials except trailers, but I don't care about that. This movie was nominated for 4 Academy Awards and it really deserves a re-release with better picture quality."
4,You Think the Cheating Ended Here?,"Is there honesty in any show that has prizes involved? I don't think so. People are out there trying to hustle people out of pocket change, so why wouldn't contestants try dishonesty when big prizes, big money and/or instant fame is there for the taking.The Actors in ""Quiz Show"" play their characters realistically and creatively. The script was brilliant and perfectly delivered by everyone in front of the cameras. Support crews were perfect. Every detail seemed to be connected and complete. A thoroughly professional group effort.The story is probably known by most of the viewers, but just in case you're not, in a nutshell... winning contestants are given the answers to the questions on this popular game show. Eventually, this illegal practice is discovered, investigated and finally, was the basis for the restructuring of television games shows.I think that Ralph Fiennes did a marvelous job with his role of braniac to T.V. celebrity."
3,A bare bones DVD of a good movie,"This is the Robert Redford's best movie in my opinion. He does a great job with the period and the gets a great cast led by Ralph Fiennes to tell a personal story of Quiz Show scandals. The bad guys are maybe too bold about their predictions of the future, because Redford knows the future already, but otherwise the movie flows nicely with the main characters facing all sorts of moral dilemmas, and answering them as they come along.The problem with the DVD is that is has nothing special to offer. It has no commentary or making-of segment, and not even one of those documentaries on the real scandals. You can pick it up cheap now or wait until somebody releases a special edition of this fine movie."
3,Good,"This is a well-crafted film. It did not do well, and Redford whined that the American public wasn't ready to face their loss of innocence. Blaming the public for the failure of a movie is a cop out. Redford is at fault. He himself said, ""I wanted the first half of the movie to move quickly, like television itself. Then the second half I wanted to have a slower pace."" A basic rule of movie narrative is the ONLY time you can be leisurely is at the beginning, and toward the end you really have to pick up the pace. I truly believe Redford's choice to slow the movie down in the second half is why it failed. Rob Morrow's awful acting job doesn't help. But aside from those major caveats, this film is intelligent, well-written, the other performances are first-rate, and it's worth a look."
5,Good try for Robert Redford,I found Quizshow very entertaining. The detailed work of the sets and costumes really brought the movie true to life. This movie is real treat for viewer who were not born at that time.
2,"Worthwhile and thoughtful, but extremely slow-moving","Worthwhile and thoughtful, but extremely slow-moving. . .The subject is important but the movie is stretched out to make a full-length movie. It should be reduced to half its present length."
3,Art Across Time,"I got this book knowing that it was used. This was the most ""used"" I have ever seen throughout my college years. This product served it's purpose. So I am rating this item with 3 stars."
3,"The private Mary Chestnut, unpublished diary",This is a hard book to read. With all the names you have to follow at the bottom of the page it is confusing. It is what I ordered and was in the shape discribed.
5,Gary Stewart's best stuff.,"These are both recordings I have from back in the 1970's. I was very happy to see them on CD, as I am without a record player or turntable now. These two ""records"" show the versatility of Mr. Stewart from the rock-style ""Leah"" and ""I Ain't Living Long Like This"" to the true-country of the songs ""I See The Want To In Your Eyes"", ""Leah"", and ""Broken Hearted People"". The bluegrass sound of ""Pretend I Never Happened"" is a musical trip down a Kentucky dirt road. Gary Stewart was, I think, at his musical and instrumental best on these two albums. His versatility on these show from the guitar work to the piano which he played equally well.This is what I call REAL country music, the kind Nashville has seemed to forget over the years. Mr. Stewart had a unique voice, and you can hear the fun as well as the pain in it. Anyone interested in GREAT country music needs to acquire this double set on one disc (great idea!).Patrick CurtisParker, CO"
5,Timeless and Terrific,"These songs sound as great today as they did in the 70's...in fact, thanks to outstanding remastering, they probably sound better. Gary's style and range remains unsurpassed, and his powerful, haunting vocals bring pathos and emotion to many outstanding songs. This belongs in the collection of all serious country music aficionados."
5,BEHIND THE SCENES OF A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE!,"Alan Arnold was the publicist on THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. In this journal, Arnold takes you from the very beginning of principal photography to the end of production, detailing all the behind-the-scenes mishaps, adventures and difficulties associated with the filming. Included are interviews with Irvin Kershner, George Lucas, John Williams, all the cast and many of the crew. This is a treasure-trove for STAR WARS fans!"
2,Ehhh....,"Watched it once--,most of it, and probably will not watch it again. I had hoped to use it as a taching aid, but it is WAY too. Too much talking, not as much art as I was hoping for. Disappointing."
5,Radiant Brahms!,"Somehow, many of us simply should not be able to imagine the solemn majesty and imperial pianism of this outstanding and unforgettable artist around one of the everlasting musical treasures of the piano. This performance is simply out of this world. Adequate balance between expression and introspection, exquisite phrasing and refinement without never falling into cheap sentimentalism make one of my seven top choices of this sublime Op. 83. The other six would be at this order: Richter- Leinsdorff, Moravec-Belohlavek, Fleisher- Szell, Fischer-Furtwangler, Rubinstein-Munch and Anda- Fricsay.Don't let to pass this brilliant opportunity to purchase it."
5,Great winter doo-wop soul,"this is a great collection of artists singing both humourous and serious Christmas tunes. The original song of ""Little Red Shoes"" is the very best written song I have ever heard in my life. And Mr. Butler seems to sound better with every listen."
4,A very useful book for people shamed as children,"Imaginary Crimes refers to unconscious motivations such as the fear of doing better than a parent or of being disloyal to a parent which can damage people's lives. Without accepting everything the book says I think it is liberating for people stuck in their lives and a very good guide to finding patterns in one's life. If you have been subjected to guilt, embarrassment or shame in your childhood, I recommend this book, if you can get it"
1,"SEW, SEW BAD","The seamstress won't keep you on pins and needles, nor will it keep you in stitches. It just falls apart like a badly hemmed wedding dress. The script is as tangled as a spool of thread and the directors talent could not fill a thimble. The movie ends with a blatant murder by the heroine(Enough, Sleeping With the Enemy)-yeah, I've even seen that before. Don't buy, don't rent, don't even look at the dvd cover."
2,Seamstress,"Allie's father has disappeared on an island, and she wonders if his connection to an old crime is responsible. A woman was brutally killed by an angry crowd, and her murderous ghost haunts those responsible for her death. While Allie and her friends search for her father, people start dying in increasingly horrifying ways. The story was confusing and choppy. It relied on film editing too much to tell the story. It could of been a great horror movie but it was just too cliche. It's a cheezy formulaic studio horror movie, not even worth a rental."
2,ALL SEVEN OR THE ONE,"The film opens with Allie (Kailin See) trying to piece together clues of her father's murder. She comes across all kinds of weird supernatural stuff and symbols. The movie then shifts gears from a scary supernatural story to an up beat slasher film as a bunch of young adults go to an island. It is here on the island that the plot is explained about the cursed seamstress who sews shut the eyes and mouth of her victims. If you watch a lot of horror films, you will most likely be bored with this one as it brings nothing new to the table. The acting lacked. The plot wasn't bad, but the drama and filler material, as well as the dialouge was weak. This is evident during an early scene where Allie confronts the sheriff (Lance Henriksen) over the murder of her father. Might be tolerable as a low budget rental.F-bombs, sex, brief rear nudity."
5,Expressions of Faith,"This program is wonderful. I just updated to version 7 from an earlier version. The main thing that caught my attention was the ease in using the program. It's easy to move around in, make changes, more art work, and makes life easier when I need to make a card, certificates, banners, bookmarks, mini-cards. I have no desire to go looking for any other programs of this type. It blends well with my CreataCard version 7. I'm glad they came out with it."
5,Artistically Easy,I have used every version of this program. Not only is it very easy to use but I love the clip art and ideas. Better than any other card program I have ever used.
3,a little upset,"I had an older version. Bought this for an upgrade, found out there was no spell check. Loved the upgrades, hated no help with spelling."
4,Highly Recommend!,"I am in ministry and use this in putting together flyers, postcards, calendars...everything! The photo editing is super easy and the clipart is great for use in a church setting.Like many have said the only complaint is no spell check."
1,Hated it!,"Did not like the program or the graphics. Returned it! RecommendHallmark software or Microsoft Print It! for home publishing of cards, banners, etc. They are the best."
1,bad customer service,The customer service department sent me a email calling me a moronthis is very bad if they want your businesswill never deal with them again.
1,very poor quality!!!,"The item was missing hardware, the finish was sloppy with drips and pools of varnish, if touched the varnish pealed off to reveal bare wood. I ordered four chairs, the finish color did not match two were almost plum the other two several shades lighter. A disappointing purchase, beware of these chairs they are a nightmare. I will now go to find the missing screws from the local store and waste a couple of hours of my life"
3,okay,"Placed two orders for these chairs. first order was smooth received e-mail conformation the next day with shipping details and had no trouble putting them together very easy. second order on the other hand was a nightmare, never received an e-mail conformation of order being placed had to e-mail them three times just to get a response to when my order was going to be shipped and it took a week and a half to receive them and I live in the same state there out of. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER IS A JOKE NOBODY EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE THERE. QUALITY OF CHAIRS ARE NOT THE BEST, YOU KINDA GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR. THEY'LL PROBABLY LAST A YEAR AT MOST, SO DON'T EXPECT THESE CHAIRS TO LAST FOREVER."
3,"Not the Best, or the Worst","Ordered a pair for extra chairs on the rare occasion I have a large number of dinner guests. Assembly was fairly straightforward, all the parts and hardware were there. However, when the packages were opened, the top of the backs of the chairs had come loose from the rest of the back assembly (didn't look to have been glued), and the wood was chipped in a few places. Had to glue the tops and chipped areas. The seats of the chairs seem oversized for the frame (not obvious from the website picture), giving them a somewhat odd look. Since they're tucked in the corners of the dining room for occasional use, the defects are not readily obvious, and they've served their purpose on holidays, etc."
2,sloppy and disappointing,"I've greatly enjoyed this series but found this installment to be sloppy and disappointing. If you are new to the series you're better off skipping this one. The others are all fine and some of them are even excellent. If you read this book and were disappointed, don't give up on Stephanie Barron, she's usually much better."
4,Jane is at it again!,"This mystery, the seventh in Barron's series, focuses mostly on Jane and the Gentleman Rogue, as they both try to solve crimes that signal the destruction of England at the hands of the French conspirators. A killer is loose, slashing throats and causing havoc while Jane and Lord Harold try to track down not only the killer, but the whereabouts of one of Lord Harold's old loves who plays a dangerous role in this story. This book is great - Barron carefully weaves a relationship between Jane and Lord Harold without getting sappy or too romantic. It's a quick, exciting read - but warning: if you are a big fan of this series, you'll be shocked with Barron's ending, wondering where the series could possibly go next!"
5,Reading for a 2nd grade student (who reads at a much lower level),"I read with a ""problem reader"" who's in 2nd grade, but reads at a much lower level. This book was interesting to him, had great photos, and was easy for him to feel good about reading. ""You didn't even have to tell me any words!"" (well, not quite, but it was a great success!"
3,Questionable design,"I just recently received this posing table and stool as a gift and while it will do for me what I had hoped as far as a posing table and stool, the instructions were not clear at all, basically just a grouping of illustrations which didn't include a description for attaching the foot rest to the stool. Nothing is there to hold the table top or the stool seat to the pneumatic risers. So if I pick them up to move them, the table moreso than the stool, the top will come off. Don't know if I would purchase any like items from this company in the future."
2,Skip this low quality book,"Despite being published in 1990, many of the contributed chapters are written on typewriters, with low quality illustrations and typesetting. The quality of writing is often not much better, making for a book that is tedious to read. There are a lot of books on liquid crystals, and you can do much better than this set of volumes."
1,Another Kleypas book that was unreadable,"I really tried, but this is yet another Kleypas novel that I wasted money on and couldn't finish. This one's about some girl who is supposed to marry some old aristocrat. Instead of marrying him, she sells the poor guy's heirloom ring he gave her and traipses off to London. She plans on seducing the greatest actor who ever lived, not only that, but he is the hottest actor who ever lived. And like in a lot of this writer's books, this hero is haunted by his miserable past. Only like a lot of her heroes, his past isn't really all that awful compared to a lot of folks. Still it's enough for him to swear off love...until the moment he sets his eyes on our innocent miss and then it is lust at first sight quickly going to love. Not only that but both like to self analyze everything. It's so boring. Ugh. I almost got half way through but could care less about the two lovebirds."
1,Nothing romantic about this,"******SPOILERS AHEAD********Wow. What a let down. I loved so many of Lisa Kleyas' books but this one was just plain bad. I did not like this story at all. Logan Scott was utterly un-likeable. He treats Madeline horribly throughout the story. At the very, very last moment, when she finally decides to quit being an emotional doormat for him, he experiences ONE moment of guilt. And because of this she agrees to stay with him?! Just like that?!This book needed to be twice as long so that he could at least redeem himself a little by trying to make up for his awful treatment of her. UGH!!"
3,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed this book much more than SOMEWHERE I'LL FIND YOU. I think Logan and Madeleine are both more interesting characters than Damon and Julia.Logan is one of the more interesting romance heros. I have a soft spot for temperamental artists, I guess.However, Madeleine was a bit too sweet and too naive and too immature, where at times I wished I could reach out and shake her a time or two.The first three fourths of the book was very good, with an especially sweet love scene. But near the end comes the tired old ""marriage without love"" plot which makes me grit my teeth because I've read it so many times. However, my liking for the characters made it endurable."
4,Ok,"Good readI wish the ending was better, it was a very fickle reason for him to withhold his love, but a good read."
1,Not one of her best,"I usually enjoy Kleypas' books, but I found I did not like either of the two main characters in this book. There was way too much analysis getting in the way of the story"
2,Very boring,"Lisa Kleypas has become one of my favorite authors: she writes sexy stories in the Regency times. But this book is very boring and very predictable. The girl is very insipid, little attractive and I really didn't feel that she had anything in herself that could attract such a wonderful hero. Yes, he is magnificent, powerful, charismatic and I enjoyed a lot imagining this kind of David Garrick with a deep and seductive voice. Sorry but the history develops in a very trite way: the sick hero is something very used."
2,No more Lisa Kleypas for me,"I gave this book a try after reading ""Somewhere I'll Find you"" (Which was even worse than this) because other reviews said this book was much better... and it was. But it wasn't good. It was too cliche, the writing was too modern for the time period the book is set in and it was really tough to get through. No more Lisa Kleypas books for me. I just finished the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon and this writing doesn't even fall in the same league."
2,fluffy but flat,"This was an average and rather plodding story of a girl trying to get out of an arranged marriage who decides to ruin herself with a dashing rake.All of her characters are dashing rakes with some inner decency which is very hard to find. They are all sombre and silent Heathcliff types who use sex as a way of entertaining themselves and as a weapon to control women. I never get the sense of any clear commitment from any of her couples, only women boinked into submission.The women especially are all naive virigins who endure untold suffering losing their virginity in 'love' scenes which make me cringe and wonder how on earth and supposedly talented rake can be so indifferent to their feelings.They are all just too flat and unbelieveable for me. About as sensual as a dead fish and just as exciting."
3,Not my favorite,"I've read most of Kleypas' books and this one didn't grab me as much. Mainly because the hero was brutish, and often quite nasty. There was only two scenes where he was softer, and they were short and straight after, I went back to disliking him again. I seriously couldn't empathise with him and his reason for being so hard. I didn't think Kleypas offered a good enough reason for him to be so rough with the heroine. And I couldn't understand how the heroine could allow that type of behaviour over an extended period of time. the ""i love you"" scene was very brief and didn't really feel like a welcome relief. I kept hoping the heroine would just leave him.It's not to say that the book isn't worth a read. I enjoy reading Kleypas' novels. She has a wonderful style and is entertaining, but this one didn't leave me feeling good about their relationship."
2,This is a Reprint of a 1997 Book,"I ordered this book for my wife thinking it was new. It is actually a re-release, reprint, of a 1997 book. This was not stated anywhere on Amazon. I actually pre-ordered it long ago. Her next truly new book comes out in February 2012."
4,Wow,"All of Lisa Kleypas's books has a way with me. It gets me all worked up. At time, I find myself yelling at the heroine, then at the hero. I get all upset and swear I will never read another of her book again but then slowly the story unfold and then I find myself falling in love with both heroine and hero. I hate it sometimes but I have to admit, Lisa Kleypas is a good Author. If you haven't read any of her books, you should try. Read it all the way to the end. You'll find it was actually worth the anger. ^_^"
3,"Good, but far from Kleypas' best","This book follows in a similar vein to many of Kleypas' novels, as she does love to focus on the underdog hero, but somehow it lacked the same spark and vitality as some of her others. It lacked a certain sizzle. I didn't find either of the main characters terribly appealing. Maddy's character was too much of a dichotomy without explanation, one moment fierce and defiant, the next meek and submissive. Logan I just couldn't fathom; Kleypas usually invents delightful tortured heroes, but I don't think she gave him enough depth. I also did not care for his change of character partway through the novel, after marrying Maddy. Some of those scenes were too reminscient of conjugal rape in the style of Rhett Butler for me to be entirely comfortable with them. Still, if you're not being very particular, it's still worth a read."
2,"Bland, bland, bland...","I'm a big Lisa Kleypas fan, and I was really disappointed with this book. Too much psychobabble (which is especially offensive in an era before Freud was born), too many standard cliches and plot devices, and a plethora of cardboard characters guarantee a must-yawn read. The prequel to this, Somewhere I'll Find You, is even worse. Skip this one, folks; for Kleypas's best works, try Only With Your Love, Then Came You, Dreaming Of You or Midnight Angel. However, despite the book's many flaws, it's still a Kleypas and therefore readable--barely. It's not overtly offensive, just really bland and kind of silly."
2,Mummy costume,"I didn't like this costume. It was difficult to put on without assistance, and the wrap didn't stay in place."
5,Stunning detail.,"This book is nearly complete enough to build the real ship. It's quite amazing that this ship, that changed naval warfare, never fired a shot in her entire career!"
5,Highly recommend!!!,This is an excellent book with some impressive resume samples and interview tactics. It covers everything you need to know to find internship and/or full-time job while still being a college student. The most important is that it is up-to-date and that it gives you a great insight into how to begin your carrier path.
3,Full-throttle garage rock,"The Sonic's second album from 1966 features gut-wrenching songs like ""Cinderella"", ""He's Waiting"", and their slaughtering take on ""Louie, Louie"" which is way better than the Kingsmen could have ever done. The sound of the music is mean and dirty. ""He's Waiting"" is the best track on the album. Lead singer Gerry Roslie sounds as if he is going to shred his vocal cords. What's a shame though is the fact that the Sonics did not write enough original material for the album. Their original songs were great, but the covers simply do not hold up very well (except ""Louie, Louie"") which is why this album gets 3 stars. This is about the dirtiest sound you will ever hear from a 60's garage band, though. The CD reissue from Norton contains some live tracks from a 1972 reunion concert and a great original B-side called ""The Hustler""."
3,No images.,"This is available in the public domain and you can get it in pdf format with images. In this kindle book, which I purchased today, there are no images; I was hoping it did have images that's why I took a chance. That's too bad. But if you just want text, it's fine. [...] has it available for free in the public domain and also as a pdf download with the images, also free. [...]"
4,McGruffey's Third Eclectic Reader - how I found it,"Happen to see this in Nappanee, IN at the Amish Acres school house. Got it for my grand kids, but I am enjoying it right now. A bit of history of how learning was years ago."
5,Great monitor! No regrets!,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.I use my computer for all sorts of things-- business, internet, gaming... everything. I have been reading many reviews, from Tom's Hardware and CNet, and I was primarily worried about ghosting and the slow response of LCD's in general. Well you will have no regrets with this monitor. It is simply wonderfull!. Love it! I used it to play Star Wars KOTOR with no ghosting at all. Great for work and internet too.Sincerely,No regrets."
4,Good picture quality,Really nice LCD panel. This LCD can be used for graphics and other stuff. It's relatively fast and comfortable to use. The quality of the screen is not bad.
3,"Nice price, nice screen","It's working out well so far. In 1024x768 mode, the picture wasn't aligned properly, and tweaking the vert/horiz wouldn't help. Once I put the thing into 1280xwhatever it looks spiffy. My video card doesn't have enough flavor to handle full-screen TV tuner action, though. Good buy!!!! I'd definitely recommend this Mexican wonder."
5,Very Impressive,"I got this monitor to replace a 17inch Sony LCD. My first impression was wow. I did not think that the improvement would be so big, the color's seem more life like and simply look amazing. Once you work on a 19inch LCD you will never be able to go back to a smaller size. The picture on this Smasung is outstanding and in games it is simply beautiful. I have worked with 19inch LCD's where they were slow in response time, this is defffinatley not one of those. One thing i should point out is that this monitor does have a DVI port on it, however it does not come with a DVI cable, avg price of a DVI cable can be around $30-$100 which blew me away. I got a $30 cable at a computer store and i feel that it was well worth it."
4,Wonderful Book,"Sam and Alice were friends who liked to play on the farm. One day they heard a loud clucking noise coming from the hen house. They ran to see what it was and found that the hen had laid an egg. Sam and Alice decided to put the egg in a bucket and take it home in the wheelbarrow. Sam held the egg out to Glen the dog to show him what they had found, and while doing that he dropped it. The egg smashed as it fell on the ground. Just then Sam and Alice heard the noise again and went running to find another egg. Then they put it in the wheelbarrow and took it home to their mom. They were quite pleased with themselves for finding the egg and showed it off to everyone. I liked this book because it was about two kids who just had fun playing on the farm. They had a blast out of the littlest things, that as teenagers and as we get older we don't think much of. I would recommend this book because it is just a simple story about two friends..."
2,night light,"Not very bright at all, doesn't turn off when the room light goes on so it stays on all the time. Can't tell how to replace the lightbulb"
4,"Great sound, great music!","The sound quality is impeccable! I picked up this recording because it is really the only decent Mocedades compilation that deals with their 80s work. Songs like ""Maitechu Mia,"" ""Cuando Tu Nazcas,"" and ""Asi Fue Nuestro Amor"" (all from the album ""La Musica"") are all classics impossible to find in the States (or in Seattle, at least!). This album also has a bunch of live tracks from a live album called ""15 Anos De Musica."" Basically, you get a lot of songs you could only find on expensive imports. It's a good primer for Mocedades, and after you're hooked you can go buy their back catalogue, like I have. Thanks to Amazon for carrying it!"
5,COMO TODO LO DEL AUTENTICO MOCEDADES...,"LO COMPRAS Y LO GUARDAS, LO ESCUCHAS Y NO LO PRESTAS, NO SEA QUE TE LO VAYAN A DAÑAR, ME COSTO TRABAJO, MUCHO, CONSEGUIRLO, NO SE PORQUE, SEGURAMENTE ES TANTO SU EXITO COMO SU DEMANDA, LA CANCION QUE ME FASCINA, ""COMO SIEMPRE"" EN ESTA VERSION EN ESPAÑOL, PERDON EN CASTELLANO ES INIGUALABLE, ¿ A QUIEN NO LE TIEMBLAN LAS RODILLAS AL OIRLA? TRAE RECUERDOS INCREIBLES."
5,EXCELENTE,ES UNA EXCELENTE RECOPILACION. ESTE ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES GRUPOS DE MUSICA POP. NUNCA PASARA DE MODA. LOS QUE AMAMOS ESTE TIPO DE MUSICA SIEMPRE ESCUCHAREMOS ESTE GRAN ALBUM.
5,Mocedades,"I am no music critic, but I know what I like, and I absolutely love this recording (set of two actually). I bought the set because I remembered their early recording of ""Er Es Tu"" from the 1970's. I expected more music in the same vane but was pleasantly surprised to hear the variety and range of song on this set. I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY IT AGAIN IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THIS SET. I play it as background continuously."
5,SHOWERS OF BLESSINGS,"Without a doubt this is one of my favorites, it is such a Blessing, keep up the GOOD WORK.God Bless"
3,Kick the tires 'n light the fires,"More or less as expected for a naval pilot documentary. A little slower paced than I would have liked, covering the 2 pilots' lives more than the actual flying. Some great video footage, and especially nice was the fact that the aircraft flown is the F-14, an aircraft now retired that we will see less and less of."
5,Amazing & Inspirational!,"I don't know if I was lucky and I got a pre-release version of this DVD a couple of years ago, but is this such an amazing and inspirational movie. I love the subtitle ""Some Dreams are Worth Fighting For."" I have had junior high and high school students watch this movie to inspire them to have high goals for their life and to do everything they possibly can to achieve those goals.This movie is also amazing in the way it is filmed. The in flight shots were done very nicely. The filters used in those scenes make them look beautiful. I've been waiting for this movie to be released on Blu-ray so that I can see this amazing movie in high definition. If you're like me and you're picky with movies you buy between Blu-ray and DVD, this is a movie you'll want on Blu-ray."
5,A superb film in the Santa Barbara Film Festival,"I was pleased to view his documentary film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. I was also able to meet the two pilots, the Producer, Director and Editor of the film. As a retired Lt. Colonel and an aviator, I found the storyline quite excellent. A true story and something we rarely have an opportunity to see in this day and age of our military. The storyline of the two young pilots was well done, the cinematography superb, and the information about the requirements of attaining and being selected for the flight status in the F-14 was very interesting. Although the F-14 is no longer in the inventory and has been replaced by a more modern aircraft, the story is no less interesting. I encourage you all to see this film. Well done."
5,Great movie,"We saw this at the San Diego Film Festival and loved it. It is a rare glimpse of the intensity of fighter pilot training, with amazing footage from the cockpit. Excellent documentary!"
4,Speed and Angels,This documentory was awesome. For someone who grew up loving fighter planes I found this video to be great. It featured amazing dog fight sequences and real heart hitting stories about the piolots.
5,Fantastic from start to finish....,"What makes this film so compelling is how it seamlessly combines rich, fully developed personal stories with incredible aerial footage and inside knowledge of the navy. Either one of these alone would make for a great film, but the combination really takes the film to a whole different level. A ""must see"" without a doubt."
5,It's Not About The Planes,"With apologies to Lance Armstrong, ""It's not about the planes,"" although the footage of these fighter pilots in action is thrilling to watch. No, it's about the two young pilots whose progress through Top Gun school this film follows, and their older comrades and mentors. Put aside all thoughts of a cheeseball flick like ""Top Gun."" You couldn't ask for two more engaging, interesting young people to feature in a movie of any kind, let alone a documentary about a slice of military life. This movie is not pro- or anti- anything, expect for being pro- talented, dedicated people. I have no particular fascination with war or the military, but I've seen ""Speed & Angels"" three times now. One of the three best documentaries I've ever seen. Five stars."
1,Poor quality,"Bought this as a gift for a family member who is big on fighter planes, dogfights etc. but new to BluRay High Def movies. Luckily, it wasnt the only BluRay DVD he got or he might of returned his new player. Barely, and I mean BARELY qualifies as high def visually and about average audiowise. Should only be considered if its found in a bargin bin somewhere."
1,speed and angels,"The quality of the footage is absolute rubbish probably one of the worst ive seen for quality.Certainly does not qualify as bluray,and barely standard dvd.Would not recommend this at all."
5,Best Military Aviation Documentary Ever!,"I was blown away by this film. Yes, BLOWN AWAY!It captures everything about military aviation without being cliched, preachy, or sentimental. This is a must own."
3,Starter Culture,The package was received in good condition and a timely manner.There were 2 starter cultures in the Kit.1st culture was dead or inactive.2nd culture worked fine.So you could say the product was 50% workable in comparision to what was ordered.
4,Great Starter Tent,"I just set up my new Forester Tent, it is the perfect size for my family of 4 and did'nt break my bank account. A breeze to setup and take down. I just wish that it included steel pegs."
1,two strikes - you're out coleman,"The first time we set up this tent, the floor seam ripped. We took it back and were assured this was a good tent so we exchanged it. When we set it up, it ripped in the same place. It is not fun having mosquitos in the tent. I would not get a tent like this if i were you."
3,Equip A Trailer Sailer For Ocean,"The DVD wasn't a polished, professional production, but it got the information across.The seller didn't answer all of my email requests for shipping schedule, but the product finally arrived"
3,Okay but Customer support lets this product down,"Okay product ,novelty wears off pretty fast (already got gps for boat),voice thing gets annoying but you can turn it off,easy to see where you going in 3D mode,would be good for courier ,taxi driver,but maps are expensive,i found it very hard to obtain power cable which makes this useless if it breaks (better keep a map in your car) and customer support lacking,don,t wish to reveal too much but all i can say is that in New Zealand they must be very under staffed. But service was friendly when i did finally hear from them."
2,this could have been a good book,"There are some interesting facts in this book once the authors get through their cursory descriptions of what Chandra Levy was like before she went to Washington including the opinions of armchair psychiatrists who have never met Chandra (like the armchair criminologists who were dead wrong about the D.C.snipers).The book cries for more painstaking details that the authors obviously had. Not much new unfortunately, but a real investigative book would be welcome"
5,Los Boleros Rancheros,"Es un grande disco de canciones que han grabado de Javier Solis, pero en la voz sentimental de Vikki Carr. Pero Vikki no canta como Javier; es simplemente Vikki, con mucho sentimentios y amor."
3,Not Heartbroken to See This One End,"Some of the stories that have been told over the last thirteen episodes were better than others but none of them were that good to begin with. While a couple of the stories managed to step it up and give the audience something special, the overall theme of the series got played out very early and left this volume with a real letdown and no satisfaction. This has been a long journey to confirm what my initial instincts told me, this series is not worth the effort."
3,Poor quality printing brings down the quality of the text,"The textbook is of very poor physical quality. I have never had a textbook with binding as cheap as this one. The binding started peeling apart the day after I got it and it is nearly totally ripped out in less than a month. Other textbooks I have used have stood up to months or years of frequent use without this problem.The book has a lot of detail, but this can be overwhelming. It isn't a terribly exciting read even considering it is a textbook. The number of sidebars in the book is distracting at times, as there is nearly one per page in many sections. I have found a small smattering of typographical errors, but no more than is expected in a first edition. The good news is that the printing is in 2 colors only and has minimal pictures which probably helped to keep the cost of printing lower. For serious study, the text is good even if the book quality itself is poor."
4,Slow shipping and handling,"The book is in fine condition, I just had to wait longer than I have ever waited for a book in my life."
5,Awesome book,"I originally had the Physical Organic book from Felix Carroll. Though that book is really good, I liked this book better for its detail and illustrations. It is a very good book to review concepts as well as learn in depth organic chemistry. I'm very picky about my books but was really glad this one was able to detail a subject I was having problems with: Felkin-Ahn models. So far it has helped me in studying for my cume's and I plan on keeping it for some time.Truly recommend this book."
2,Disappointment,"I expected his ""Greatest Hits"" to include music from the 40's and 50's, but this CD had 1920's hits, none of which included his wonderful large chorus."
1,Where is the information?,I am interested in buying but there is no listing of the songs on the CD. What are they? How many? How about a sample or two?
4,Best language overview,"This book is the best language overview yet made. All languages and dialect spoken are shown here, including the number of speakers, area in which the language is spoken etcetera."
1,On a mission,"I was disappointed with myself that I didn't notice I had purchased the 12th edition (used 1992)but more importantly that this book was initiated as a catalogue for Christian missionaries. After the entry for GREEK, it states ""NT 1638-1989"". I thought the NT, New Testament, was originally written in Greek.I will keep it as a handy catalogue of languages, but I will look elsewhere for information on the languages of the world."
5,GREAT Cam.,"I got this Cam. to take With me to see WWE Live In Bossier City,LA then to Dallas and All My Video's and pics. Came out GREAT So If you Have Someone On your Christmas List that you have NO Iead what to get them Get Them One of These Cams. They will LOVE It and They are REALLY Easy to use!"
4,ALL-RIGHT,"If you are looking for a professional video camera, this is not the the one you should get,however, if you just want a small fast liitle camera then this is the one for you. It works well in the day time, but it does not work good in dark places, probably because it doesnt have a flash. You are ready to start taking pictures when you buy it, but the internal memory does not hold a lot of pictures/videos, but you can always buy a cf card to take care of that issue. So if you just want to have a nice small camcorder, then this is the one 4 u"
1,Very poor picture and sound.,"Although the Aiptek Pocket DV Digital Video Camcorder - 3100size is appealing, the picture quality is very poor and grainy. Both the still shots and videos were not even worth keeping. There was nothing that was even useable. Above all, the sound was the worst. It was so distorted, I could barely make out what was said. After one day with this camera/camcorder, it's going back."
2,To cheap for the price,"I have to agree with the fellow from PA; it feels cheap and , it is. I got it as a father's day present from my son. I was very excited at first, but after trying it, I got discouraged and dissatisfied. But, I have to bite the bullet. Otherwise, it would be back on the store. In my opinion, to high of a price for what you are getting. I think the manufacturers could have done better."
3,"Realmente no es una cámara digital, es un Webcam con muchas funciones","La cámara me conquistó. El precio, las especificaciones, su forma, lo compacta, ligera, sus accesorios y sus funciones, me dije Guauuuu!.... Cuando la preferí ante otras opciones de su mismo precio lo único que me molestaba eran las pilas desechables, pero se trata de un aparato realmente coqueto. Nunca me percaté que no dice nada por ninguna parte sobre el FLASH, me di cuenta ya tarde. ¿A QUIÉN SE LE OCURRE PONER EN EL MERCADO UNA CÁMARA DIGITAL SIN FLASH? Fue realmente una gran decepción, porque la compré para regalo y ahora su dueña no puede tomar fotos de sus reuniones bajo techo a menos que sean debajo de un bombillo. Triste, me sentí como estafada, tiene mil funciones pero no trae flash!"
4,Good For the Price,First of all many people complain about the memory and the batteries first of all its your fault that you didnt get a bigger memory card in the first place! Bad memory card quality also is not aipteks problem! The batteries can be replaced with Ni-mh If needed and the camera is quite good with 3.1 megapixels playback on that small of a package is nice for the price. Now if you were planning on video taping something important than definetly wait and buy a better Sony camera that uses the mini dv tape. But this is fantastic for what I plan to use it for which is taping my friends and i snowboard so we dont need great quality or sound But want to be able to watch it on the tv which Is the simplest camera to tv I have used Yet! Have not tried the computer software but dont plan to. This is a fantastic Device for the price. I recommend for outdoor use with friends for sports that youll be close as there is no Zoom with the video recording.Four Stars ****
4,Awesome Cam.....,IT is a very awesome camera with several features. The only downside to it is that it has a very bad microphone and speaker
1,Horrible,"This camera is horrible and didnt work, the movies are very choppy and its not all that it says it is i reccomend not to buy this camera, the clips wouldnt even download onto my computer."
4,Awesome cam at awesome price,"This camera is definantly worth the 92.99(I got it on sale). It has all the features I needed except for it doesn't have a flash, but I use it mainly outside anyways and it works great"
4,"great camera, little price","This is a great camera. It takes excellent pictures and video. I gave this only 4 stars because it does not have a flash. This camera can only be used outdoors or in good indoor lighting. It is about the size of your hand and easy to use. I do recommend though that you not buy this camera from Target. That is where I bought mine and when I tried to exchange it for the 4500 model which has a flash, I was told that I could not return or exchange the camera because it was opened. The store was very rude and now I am stuck with this camera and can not get the one that I really want. I do like the camera and I will keep it but I will not ever buy anything from Target again!!! I should have bought it from Best Buy or Circuit City which both carry the camera and have much better return and exchange policies. I do recommend that if you purchase this camera you go through Best Buy or Circuit City. If you want this camera with a flash I suggest purchasing the DV4500 model."
3,no tech support,"The camera works fine, but I cannot get the software to work. I have contacted tech support by e-mail twice to help with this, but have not received anything back. I have needed to send some pictures to friends since Labor Day weekend, but have been unable to. The website is good, but the tech support apparantly is non-existent. Glad it did not cost me much for the camera since it does not work with the computer!"
3,Okay Camera,This camera is a lot of fun. Must be really close to target to get good shots. Good starter camera.
1,Not what I expected,"I was excided about this item. At first it was ok because I was outside, but once you got inside it took forever to get the lighting right and even then it was to dark. Its ok for maybe young kids that want to explore but not for professional use.&#60;br /&#62;<br />thanx"
2,low cost low quailty,I returned this camcorder. sound quailty was poor and picture lighting was very poor. Camera body itself is made cheaply (all plastic).You would be better off spending a little more.
4,I love this camera,"This camera is definatley worth $100. the zoom may not be that good and it has no flash but on a nice good sunny day you can get really nice footage. i already made 5 movies from this camera! If you want to see them you can e-mail me about them. Kyle11757@yahoo.com . It has easy delete, nice effects, and is really small and perfect for traveling. I recommend this camera to everyone!"
2,Bad Camera,"When I got this camera I didnt read that it didnt have a flash, BIG MISTAKE. When you take pictures inside they always turn out to dark and are really grainy. We took a trip to Florida and ALL of the pictures turned out blurry! Im 100% I was not moving to. It actually takes pretty good vidos but thats about it. I would not recommend this camera/video camera."
2,"its ok, not the best","i am a skateboarder that bought this camera thinking i could go videotape me and my friends skating, but its such a piece of crap, the still photos are splochy and video recording is really sketchy and u have to get in just the perfect light for it to work at all. the features are pretty cool though, just not of the best quality.the voice recorder on it is the worst part of the whole thing, its just worthless.but, overall, the camera isnt worth the money at all. its probably worth about 20 bucks tops...so dont get this camera and get ripped off like i did!!!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this product for its portability. I was hoping that I could use this as a substitute for both a digital camera and a camcorder. However, I was very disappointed at the quality of both. The pictures are very grainy and hardly resemble that of a 3MP camera. The videos are a bit choppy and the 320x240 view screen is much to small. If portability is all that matters, this camera will manage. However, if you are looking for both size and quality, you best look elsewhere. After all, it's only $100. You get what you pay for."
3,review,"It is a pretty good camera and all but there isn't that many features as i though there would be no flash, zoom but not when were taping not too much of memory DO NOT USE WHEN IT IS DARK IT NO GOOD even it the house it sucks but hey for a hundred it's good"
2,2 out 2 IS bad,"I purchased this item and received a damaged unit. The CD player just doesn't work. The display is a horrible readout. May look cool & funky in the pictures, but it is so not practical, not to mention the far left character doesn't even light up. The second one is no better. You can purchase the same thing from Timex cheaper. NOT recommended."
2,How Annoying....,"Well, I wanted a clock that could wake me up with nature sounds or alarm. Only one or two of the four nature sounds are bearable. They are way too repetitive and two of them are more annoying with squawking birds than soothing. The light has three settings. Even the dimmest setting appears as a beacon in my room at night. It wakes me up at night! If you're in the market for an all-in-one nature sounds alarm clock...keep looking!!!"
3,"ok, but bad hinges","One of the hinges on the CD Player top broke about a month after I bought this. But it still works, I just have to be very careful with the top. Otherwise, a fine alarm clock/radio/CD player."
2,This clock is TOO BRIGHT!,"After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try, boy was I wrong. I returned it the next day and bought the Timex T608T, it has the same features as this one except for the annoying bright yellow light. This alarm clock lets off too much light to be used in a bedroom. If you look at it in a dark room you will go blind! The lowest setting on the dimmer is still too bright. I don't care for the shape of this, it looks like a boom box. The controls are hard to use, there everywhere even in the back of the unit. The numbers on this unit are a little small and rounded, if you wear glasses you might need them to read the time."
2,"What, am I blind?","This is a nice enough radio in itself. It's big and bulky, and its round shape does pooly on my perpetually cluttered nightstand. The controls work fine, though they're poorly laid out. What's really annoying is the light this thing puts off. It is BRIGHT. I have to cover the face when I sleep, and if I look at it in the dark, there goes my night-vision. It has a dimmer switch with, strangley, three settings. They're all still too bright. Add to that the two indicator lights, a green FM indicator and a red battery warning, and you've got a radio you could use as a lighthouse.Note to clock-radio designers: Red light does not interfere with your night vision. There's a reason it used to be used in clock radio displays."
4,Excellent for first medium humidor,"Ordered this and sent it to my house to fill with good cigars so when I get home, I can enjoy one of my favorite deployed pass-the-times. Wife loves how it looks and she said set up was easy. The hygrometer is off quite a bit and she says that it can't be adjusted, so we are just adding 20% to the reading. Cats seem to love the tassle on the key too much, so she is considering changing that."
4,Sweet and gentle,"My brother introduced me to Pierce Pettis through a song on a compilation cd. I was so moved by the acoustic guitar playing, and that deeply resonant, pleasing voice singing ""Black Sheep Boy,"" that I wanted more! So, I purchased ""Great Big World."" I wasn't disappointed. ""Great Big World"" is a nice slice of American life, a collection of good short stories about ordinary people: only these are stories you listen to instead of read. In these uncertain times, this is a comforting cd."
4,Another Fantastic Pettis Release,"It is such a shame that artists like Pierce are so overlooked. He is so good, so thoughtful, creative, talented...rare. This cd continues his string of superb releases (since Making Light of It.) I am not yet ready to say that this one tops Everything Matters, but after a few more listens, perhaps I will be. The lyrics are thoughtful and well-crafted, the musicians who play with him are excellent, and the arrangements are beautiful. You really cannot do better than Pierce Pettis in this genre. I especially love his songs about his children and about parenthood. He is able to touch the ecstasies and agonies that parents feel everyday, and to capture those priceless moments that you wish wouldn't go away without be sappy or overly sentimental."
5,loved it!,"I absolutely loved this show. The ideas are great, the storytelling is great, and most people hate me for this but I really like this better than mythbusters. There are a lot of summerizations within episodes but if you can fast-forward through it, it wont bother you. This really inspired me as an enginner, and I would recommend this to anyone!"
1,"""See Mackenna's Edition of the Enneads""","It must be noted, first off, that this small pamphlet contains only a small fragment of Plotinus' superlative work, The Enneads. While On Nature, Contemplation and the One remain singularly important as a part of Plotinus' massive body of work, it still stands, nevertheless, that it is difficult to understand the whole of the Alexandrian philosophers thought with merely a portion of his writings. This pamphlet only engenders injustice for both Plotinus and for Thomas Taylor, the worthy translator of this text. For nearly the same price one may find Stephen MacKenna's much more scholarly edition of Plotinus' Enneads, which contains the following: a biographical sketch of Plotinus, an essay concerning the philosophers place in the history of thought, an insightful introduction, Porphyry's life of Plotinus, the preface and finally, The Enneads."
3,Low quality & Overpriced,"This book has a nice and smooth approach to Computer Vision. It can be used as a textbook.The material is older now. A revision seems to be necessary.The paper back version is really disappointment, because all of the figures are in gray scale. For the chaptersthat are about the color image processing and perception etc, this is unacceptable."
3,Series shows it's tired blood,"A good read, but long on prose and short on action, except near the end. not the best he's written. the prison idea was intriguing, but it really didn't do much. the introduction of new characters from another world was nice, but then we lost most of them. they simply don't reappear. ending was good, but the characters keep on experiencing the same doubts over and over again. not bad, but far from brilliant"
4,Hans Schuder Lives! But under the Shadow of a New Threat.,"Not as epic as its predecessors, this book is just as exciting and gives the conflict between the Humans and the Hordes an new excillirating perspective, that of the captives and slaves living under the heel of the Bantag tyrant Ha'Ark, an alien of the same species as the Hordes that has come through the Space Vortex armed with the knowledge of 20th Century Warfare. Hans Schuder, presumed dead after the Merki War, returns as a prisoner of the Bantag Horde forced to serve as an overseer in Ha'Ark's war industries. Schuder's knowledge of the Bantag preparations to conquer the human resistance and of Ha' Ark's new weapons could save the Republic if he can manage a daring escape accross hundreds of miles of enemy held territory."
4,Bilingual in German and English,"Great book. Read the poetry in German original and English translation. Full, rich, deep introduction by Mandel prepares you for the poetry that follows. Illustrated. Beautiful format."
1,Very Disappointed,"Applied product as per instructions and it killed all fleas on both my dogs immediately. The next day they had fleas on them again. It appears this product has no residual repelling properties. Its consistency is a clear, curdled jell and pouring it can be tricky. For those people who have sensitive noses, it does have a pungent odor. I can get the same results with bathroom shampoo but without the stink and price. I'm going with the pricy frontline for the time being and no fleas so far. Currently doing research on other cheaper products with fipronil in it."
5,LOVIN' IT,I AM LOVIN THIS CD. I PICKED ONE UP IN MY HOMETOWN AND IT IS OFF THE CHAIN. I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE TRACK DO SOMETHIN OR LOSE SOMETHIN. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE HELICOPTER SOUNDS AND SOME MORE SOUND EFFECTS IN IT... I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE THAT WANTS SOMETHING REAL AND HITTING FROM THE FIRST TRACK TO THE LAST.
1,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it","Creatacard newer versions are terrible. After version 3 which I love and still use, Broderbund sales people keep saying that the newer versions will be closer to the old one, but they lie. They don't work as easily and you have to go online to get what was already there on the version 3. This one stinks!"
4,Steve Does NYC--Again,"This CD seems to center on Steve's last two albums(Evergreen Boy} and (Rocking Horse Head). While I'm not a fan of most live albums, the sound on this recording is superb with the 5 piece Rough Squirrels playing as tight as a studio session. The highlight song is a beautiful version of ""Rose Marie"" which even duplicates the splendid electrified acoustic sound of the guitar work on Forbert's previous album. The only problem with this CD is it doesn't offer many of Steve's older songs(i.e. Streets of This Town or Born Too Late).Steve Forbert continues to be one of the best kept secrets around and that is truly baffling to me. His self deprecating humor and songs of unrequited love continue to be gems. I only hope that he continues to record and perform long into the future for those of us who admire and appreciate his talent."
5,"Looks great, works well",I bought these scales over three years ago and placed them where they don't get moved a lot. I change the battery about once a year. They appear to be accurate. I've gained 13 kilos since I got them.
3,Mediocre,"The one step dubbing from tape to DVD works ok. Entering title info is overly complex and non-intuitive. I have has it refuse to record a whole tape because of a tape glitch but not often. You can use Ulead DVD Moviefactory 2 or later to read the DVDs and edit the footage from a Video Mode DVD-R and burn a new fancy disk. That was more expensive awhile ago but blank DVD costs have fallen so it's less than 50 cents now.Go suggests these media at 2x, 4x would be better:DVD-R:1. Imation2. Apple3. Promedia4. Ritek5. Liquid Video6. CompUSA (CU)7. STI8. Optodisc9. DVDPRO10. DVD-ON11. ProDiscDVD-RW:1. Comp USA (2x verified ok)2. Optodisc"
1,Go Vidoe VR4940 VCR/DVD Combo.,You always have to be carefull about buying combonation items as they never work as well as the single items do. This product wroked fine for 2 monts then started to cause the color to wash out on the TV. We have and A/B swith and when we swiched to TV mode the color was fine. Go Vido only warrenties products for labor for 30 days. Since I was over they wanted $99 to send me a refurbished item. Not new as I had purchased. So I was to inherit someone elses headache!! I guess I'll stick with the devil that I know but buyer beware product just barely outlasts warrenty. Not worh it.
1,No Closed Captioning,Am disappointed that the VR4940 does not support closed captioning. Having it is important to me and lots of others when we watch dvds. The GoVideo customer support said it was not a defect of the machine...that their machines do not support it.The dvd recording quality is very good but would never have purchased it without being able to use closed captioning. Lots of DVDs do have English subtitles but many don't. Am shocked that a company would not include that option.
2,Great - Good - Fair - Poor,"My first attempt to copy a movie on VHS to DVD-R went smooth. The 2 hour movie played fine on my other DVD player. Second attempt was to copy a movie and cut the commercials. The instructions say to pause then fast foreward and press copy twice to resume. It doesn't work. All that I got was disc error after the resume.I could do it only by re-starting the copy process. Third attempt was to record a DVD from a live broadcast and cut commercials. Pause wouldn't work. I had to re-start the recorder after each break. Fourth attempt was to time record 3 shows on VHS. The manual says that it has to finalize after each recording so you will miss the beginning of the next show. I found that it would not change channels between shows and I got 3 hours of one channel, not the 3 that I programmed.I shure hope Costco will take it back!"
1,Don't buy Go Video,"I purchased a VR4940 directly from GoVideo in December of 2005. It stopped working the second time I used it. GoVideo had me mail it back to them. They sent me a new item but UPS lost it in shipping. GoVideo has refused to reimburse me or send me another unit, even though they were paid for the lost unit by UPS. In effect, they got paid twice for the same unit and I got squat. The company uses a third party support system to handle all complaints. This insulates them from dealing with customers from outside of Arizona."
1,I'm afraid most of these reviews are right on,"Very poor performer. My replacement unit just stopped recording on the VCR side. Go Video support is useless. Also it only reads DVD's when it feels like it. And locks up to the point where you have to unplug it to wake it up. Then there is no battery backup, so you have to set it up from scratch. Go ahead and buy one if you're into S&M."
1,after the warranty....under 90 days,"expect it to break. i paid so much money for this machine...and guess what.. right after the warranty was over.. it broke! i transfered maybe.. and i mean maybe 10 tapes to dvd. after that, it simply wouldn't read dvd's. there is really something wrong with the machine or the company that makes them. I can't say I paid for what I got because I paid a whole lotta money!! i wonder what kind of operation they are running! looks like a con game to me!"
1,Poor product for the money,"I used to be a recording engineer for a professional recording studio and have some fairly high end electronics in my home. I purchased this product as a gift for my parents and regret it every time I try and use it. I'm surprised my father hasn't pitched it into the lake in frustration. The controls are not user friendly, the documentation is less than useful, and the remote refuses to accept entry of numbers. On top of all of that, after very little use the DVD refuses to read any DVDs - ones that have been played on all 3 of my DVD players without any problem. The whole purpose of the purchase was to provide them with a DVD player aside from the one in their computer. I could have purchased a stand-alone DVD and a stand alone VCR for less than I paid for the combo and not had all of these issues. Personally, I will not purchase another item made by Go-Video."
1,Great till it breaks,"I enjoyed this product for three months. The day before my warranty expired, the unit froze up. My only option was to ship it back at their expense in return for a refurbished unit. It is an outrage that an expensive product like this dies in such a short time and you get stuck with some other unit that also broke down. I guess I am lucky it didn't break down one day later. I hope the repaired unit they send back lasts longer."
3,Left Empty,"I read this book in one sitting. It was a good book no doubt and quite true to life, there was just not enough meat (# of pages) in the story. A longer story would have made it worth the money. It belongs in a short story compilation and not in a book of it's own. Please don't misread this review the book was well written and was very good, just too short.Good Job William Tayor write more!"
2,Great Voice but...,Neil has an awesome voice and writes great songs but a Christmas album? I thought he was Jewish.
4,Useful,"Dan Richard helps you understand the evolving consumer, describing ways to attract new clients and how you can develop a trusting relationship. The book also talks about maximizing client referrals, doing bussiness with people you know and running effective seminars"
3,Freedom Fighters,"This movie is about the Civil War in Lebanon in the 1980's. During this time US citizens in specific were being targeted, over 50 Western citizens were taken hostage during this time and exposed to appauling conditions, and treated like animals. Back home however while the detainees are struggling for their lives, the victims families are struggling too- for the justice that will see their loved ones returned to safety. This film is a very emotional journey, be prepared few a few teary eyes!"
5,"Tense, well-acted story","It is funny to be writing about a VHS videotape production in this day and age of its approaching obsolescence. This most certainly needs to be released on DVD at some point, especially considering that two of its stars are Academy Award winners -- Colin Firth and Kathy Bates. I cannot think of anything that has shown the misery, fear, stripping away of dignity, and ultimate triumph of the human spirit better than this film. It had to cover a lot of territory in under 2 hours and did so incredibly well. Terrific acting helped, most certainly, with this stellar cast. It is still quite relevant to today and many of the real people depicted are alive and well and productive members of society as I write this.Unless HBO plans to reissue this onto DVD, not many will get the opportunity to see this small gem of a film and the first-rate performances that make up its appeal."
4,Not Bad At All,"While this book did not go over everything that was on the test (specifically, some detailed language arts professional theories), and went over several things that were not covered, this book provided a very good review for the test. Overall the questions on the actual test were less complicated than those in the practice test, so though I had stressed out a lot about learning everything in the book, it turned out that I felt very well prepared when taking the test. Obviously the material cannot be exactly the same, but it was similar enough to help me figure out what to study. I was much more pleased with this book than several other reviewers, as I used little other material and still felt confident that I did well."
4,Big help,This book was a big help for my Illinois content test for teaching. It really helped me prepare for the big test. I used this book along with many others in preparation for the test.
4,Lots of information maybe too much...,"This book is great! It covers everything you need to know for the Elementary Praxis, but some of the information goes over 5th grade level and makes you panic more than you have to. I found there was a lot of political science questions on my praxis test in the History section. So know our political system and how it works and electing for presidency. That was the only thing I didn't concentration on and there it was!! In my state a 141 in passing and I got a 151. Buy this book and maybe a smaller more specific elementary book. If you were to buy just one book this is it though.The ETS book sucks BTW it has barely any practice questions. This book is filled with practice questions!!!"
3,Praxis II,The book is dated 2002 so I am not sure how relevant the information will be on a 2008 test.
3,Could Have Been So Much Better,"When putting this together Collector's Choice had 36 hits to choose from which Ted Weems put onto the charts between 1922 and 1948. But in a 24-selection set they give us just 15. Tracks 2, 3, 12, 14, 17, 19, 20, 22 and 24 were not hits for Ted.I also doubt very much that the the others represent the original versions of his hits - mostly from the 1920s and 1930s - and are, rather, re-recordings done later in the 1940s."
4,Before Iggy there was...,"The Sonics. While other groups were trying to sound like the Beatles in 1965 the Sonics were playing garage rock with an edge that sounded more like the Stooges. Granted, on this disk you will find cover versions of songs like ""Do You Love Me"" that are probably not that interesting but original rockers like Boss Hoss and the song from the Landrover comercial, ""Have Love, Will Travel"", rock very hard with aggresiveness and menacing distortion that will mark the later work of the Stooges, Heartbreakers (not Tom Petty's group) and the New York Dolls."
3,Sonics,"Interesting but i was a little disapointed. Their music/lyric writing skills are pretty average, so most of the music sounds VERY similar in construction theme /vibe/tone. They're not in the same class as ''The Animals'' but i liked a couple of their tracks."
5,Should be required listening for all rock & roll fans,"Hey Amazon, name this disc an ""essential recording,"" because it's one of the greatest rock & roll records of all time! The Sonics pick up where ""Louie Louie"" leaves off. You can almost imagine the Sonics playing a Delta frat party at Faber College back in 1964 with Bluto, Otter and the boys of Delta house dancing the night away.Energy-laden three-chord guitar hooks and the screams of vocalist Gerry Roslie capture the dance-crazed world of the early & middle 1960s before the hippies took over. All garage bands that are around today, and many punk bands of the 70s and 80s, were heavily influenced by this band. The legendary opening organ notes of ""The Witch"" can be interpreted as a call to worship for garage-o-philes around the world."
5,This is the REAL deal. Peasant food at its best!,"I took a cooking class years ago given by Ruggiero. He had a terrific personality and was a great cook/chef as well. He owned and operated La Caravelle, an old NYC restaurant back in the 70's.This cookbook is not fine Northern Italian cuisine, but good old Sicilian peasant food straight from Brooklyn.Every recipe I have tried has come out fabulous. I love his stories about Brooklyn bakeries and pizzerias, all so true!The reviewer who wrote that ""this is a seafood book and not like Little Italy"" is dead wrong. Obviously, he is an out of towner tourist.This book is as authentic as they come.No jacket required!"
4,Well-crafted new country,"I sure do appreciate a writer who knows how to craft a good song, and this fella has got the goods. One of the legions of songwriters who feed the Nashville machine, Camp has provided hits for the likes of Garth Brooks, John Anderson and Randy Travis, and even made a record or two himself, back in the early '90s. He tilts towards the traditional end of the spectrum, and is a soulful, appealing vocalist, working in a fairly alt-y, old-school style. The whole record is pretty good, but one song, ""Tune Of The Twenty Dollar Bill,"" stands out as a real gem. A compact little story-song (of courtship back in the good old days), this is a catchy, thoroughly enjoyable, tune, and really quite memorable. Well worth checking out."
3,Not Bad,"I bought Shawn's first CD and was blown away. Song after song he hit very high standards consistently. I was hoping for more of the same but unfortunately, in my opinion, I did not find it.This CD does have some good songs with How Long Gone, That Ol' Love Thing, I Ain't The Hero and Can't Have One Without The Other. But I felt let down in between these high points.Perhaps my expectations where too high or my taste may have changed some since his first CD, which I still love. In either case, I felt a bit left down. However, this is a solid project that is in the ""New Country"" style and many folks should enjoy it very much.If you are a country fan, you will find something on this project to enjoy very much. It will be worth your while to give it a listen."
1,...,"If my title, while true, attracted you to this rotten film, turn off the TV, go outside, and play. Kaczmarek really slums here as a suffering wife whose husband gets involved in a hot little blonde number who is into S&M. The blonde, played by Sommerfield, is too pretty to have the humiliation heaped on her here in the name of sexual obsession. I really wish actors and actresses would stop making junk like this and work on their craft. There is no redeeming qualities here except for some good performances amid the dulling sex and nudity. I think ""Wildly Available"" tries to pass itself off as an independent film when, in fact, it is just desperate and sad."
4,Almost A Return To Form,"After a long hiatus, 999 recorded this CD in 1993 with the original line-up almost intact. Gone is Jon Watson, replaced by Arturo Bassick of The Lurkers. The music is heavier than where they left off in the mid-80's. Some of it even reaches the frenetic energy of the early LPs. The two-guitar interplay is not as interesting as it was in the early days when they used the Clash-esque clean Fender sound paired with the dirty Gibson. That's a shame, as I thought it was pretty effective. The songwriting is generally good. Some of the lyrics are a bit naff, and spoil the enjoyment of a few otherwise catchy tunes, but there are enough good songs to pull the weight of the weaker ones. I'd say it's their best effort since The Biggest Prize In Sport."
5,samsung dvd vhs player,I found the product very easy to install and use. The picture quality is great. I would recommend this product to anyone who asked.
3,returned,"I am sorry that I cannot give this irem a review as when UPS delivered it, I refused delivery not due to product, but I needed a DVD/VCR sooner rather than later. I was able to find this same item locally, so purchased it. I tried notifying Amazon but was unable to do so. I am sorry and trust this will not be a problem"
1,Avoid Samsung Like The Plague,"I bought this heap of crap and a Samsung TV both have failed after a year..and while they worked for the first 12 months there was always some little glitch or irritating thing that would arise...finally it gets to the point where remote is weak with new batteries installed,it DOES not play most dvd's after a year, and the TV I boight from these schmucks, just went yesterday. SAMSUNG....go back to KOREA!"
4,Great for the price . . . so far at least!,"I just brought this home, so I can't give any long-term performance notes. These combo machines seem to have a collective bad record in that regard, so we'll see. That said, the cd-player sounds great, dvd's play fine, dvd-r's, vcd's and so on (tested those 3 so far), and the VCR is more responsive than our old Sharp standalone. You can pause, ff and rew with barely a moments hesitation. You can hear the motor running softly, so if you're particular prone to hair-pulling if your electronics aren't whisper-quiet, then you may want to look elsewhere, but I wouldn't call it loud by any stretch of the imagination.For the giveaway price I'm extremely satisfied and very happy to put the old VCR deck down in the basement. I bought it at Sears and paid an extra $15 for a two year full-replacement warranty, so you probably won't hear much squealing on my end if it suffers some sort of premature melt-down, but I'll keep folks posted in any case."
1,"Short lifespan, indeed",I have purchased 2 of these. One stopped playing videotapes after about a year. The second stopped playing video on DVDs after about a year. Draw you own conclusions.
2,DVD not working well after 1 year,"This was fine at first, but like other users here we also are now having problems with the DVD player part ""freezing"" DVDs often. Our other DVD player works with the same DVDs just fine, so I think it is the fault of the player."
2,Lack of Quality & Durability,"In less than a year, the VHS tapes record badly with a wobbly/wavy quality that is murder to watch. The DVD player never did work quite right--the brightness of the screen keeps fluctuating, and alternates between normal and a dark reddish picture that resembles a blackout in Hades. Don't spend your money on this piece of work!"
4,good vcr control,"I just got this player so I can't say anything about durability. However I played some vhs tapes that didn't play well on my 2-head portable player. The tapes looked great on this player so I'm pleased with the vhs part. I tried some bought dvds and one I burned from my pc. They all worked fine. This unit is pretty basic, but at the price it does the job."
4,good value,"I bought this about two months ago and so far it is working great. For the price, it is the only DVD player I could find that plays DTS as well as full 96khz/24b. It may not equal other more expensive players, but this one certainly has a lot of value for its load of features and low price. Had to play around with output settings to get the Dolby Digital to work, but it wasn't too much of a struggle for a pleasing end result.The Hi-Fi audio on the VCR sounds much better than my old Magnavox VCR, and my reciever pulls out full surround from Dolby Prologic VHS tapes flawlessly, which sounds surprisingly good coming from the ancient VHS format.So far no complaints, I hope it doesn't decide to die after a few months like others' have."
1,A Waste Of Money!,This thing has not worked right from day one. The DVD player has always skip or paused and it seems it's very hard for the dvd to get started. A very cheap built machine. This has turned me against Samsung. I'll go back to RCA!
4,So far so good!,Super easy hookup. I usually pawn it all off on my husband but this was a snap. So far it works great & it was a reasonable price.
1,short lifespan,"I work at a school, and we ordered about 20 of these for classroom use. Not long after the warranty ran out, they started dropping like flies. Currently 10 of them quit playing DVD's, and we're just waiting for the others to go that route too."
1,Short Lifespan,"We got this DVD/VCR combo player two years ago. For the most part it worked fine. However, after two years the DVD player no longer works. Not a very long lifespan. Very disappointed."
4,Overall very satisfied,"The product works very well. I like that you can turn it on and off very quickly with just the touch of a button. The only issue I have with the product, is that you cannot rewind or fast forward when you are watching a DVD. Otherwise, very satisfied."
2,Broken ... after 8 months?,Yeah - so this worked great before it broke. Now the VCR on it isn't working and the DVD player is skipping. Might be because I had the TV on top of it (but the TV is pretty small). Very delicate - put it on a shelf or somewhere out of the way...
2,SLEAZY THRILLER,"EXPECTING MERCY is one of those movies whose message is ""It's allright to murder somebody if they are sleazy rapists."" Given that premise, this movie isn't a real turkey; it's an obvious low budget film with an interesting performance from Carrie Hitchcock. She plays the wife of a sex-crazy innkeeper who videotapes his guests having sex. Brian Mani plays Ed, the husband who has set his sights on his latest guest: a young woman who has supposedly eloped with her boyfriend. We know however that this couple is really on the run from the law as they have stolen some money from their employer who just happened to rape the young girl. Heather Prate is the girl and Jim Wagner the macho Kurt. They do well in underdeveloped roles, but it's Hitchcock who brings the most weight to this basically four character melodrama. An unusual ending helps but overall the movie is merely a psychosexual mishmash."
1,Disappointing,"I decided to give this book a chance, even though I was skeptical that someone who never went to medical school could give advice on choosing a specialty. Her book didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know. I wanted to learn about what really makes each medical specialty unique, but the ""question and answer"" format made each chapter almost identical. The answers were so vague and non-specific that you could apply them to almost any specialty. I finished each specialty chapter wondering ""I forget - what specialty was I reading about again?"" Definitely an over-rated book, but perhaps because there are no other books out there on this subject."
1,Disappointing,"My roommates and I bought this book together looking for a comprehensive overview of each specialty-- typical practice settings, level of competitiveness (for residency spots, fellowship spots, and beyond), income, and future prospects/directions for each field. We wanted numbers with an objective interpretation. We couldn't find such information anywhere else, and, unfortunately, we didn't find it here either.This book is a hodgepodge of trite quotes and whatever the author found during a 15-minute search on Medline-- I know because I tried it myself, and I got the same handful of articles that she cites. The information she presents is often outdated or taken out of context, and is generally too vague and/or superficial to be of use in any case.I cannot imagine how anyone other than the author herself would rate this book highly. Save your money.I wish I could recommend some more useful resource, but I still haven't found it."
1,About as usefull as an ashtray on a motorbike,The CD liner congratulates you on purchasing the most comprehensive collection of automotive repair informationavailable today. If you consider a total of 20 lines of information on how to remove a V8 engine comprehensive then you won't be dissapointed. If however you were looking for the one source describing all manner of repair information then you are better spending your money elswhere.The TSB are usefull even if they are very short and poorly scanned (The pictures look like an old photocopy)The help desk cuts you off numerous times and if they decide you have been on hold too long they even say goodbye before cutting you off.My advice is to spend the money on a Chilton or Haynes manual (or any other of your choice). In the past I have complained about Haynes. Never again.
1,Alldata,"Simply put, Alldata sucks. I'm an ASE Master Technician. Alldata has given me fits in the past. I won't use it. If you want the best and don't like wasting time, in my experience (10 + yrs.), get Mitchell repair manuals. I just clicked on this site to see why an employer would buy it as mine did...you get what you pay for."
1,I Hate This Phone,"I really wanted a corded phone in addition to my cordless phone, but not one that had a lot of features I didn't need (answering machine, caller ID, etc.) because I have those on my cordless phone.Anyway, when I saw this, it really caught my eye. It has a classic design with contemporary flair. The price wasn't bad either. The push buttons with the rotary style is a nice detailOne drawback is that the receiver is very heavy. The shape of the receiver makes it difficult to put the phone on your shoulder to talk hands-free. I did that on the receiver slipped, hitting me in the lip and teeth. OUCH!When it is near an electronic device (like my laptop), there is annoying static on the phone."
3,It's got the look!,"I was drawn to this phone for it's retro look. I also needed a corded phone in my home, and I thought this one would be perfect, and on budget, the price was right. It's different, I get lots of compliments on the phone, everytime anyone visits my home, and it fits me...it's a 'chick' phone, and that's fine with me. A low-tech, low to no maintenance phone, If I had any complaints, I guess it would be that it took some time getting used to the way the keypad was set up, and it's only available in white...I want a different color to match my bedroom!"
4,Cutest phone EVER,"I've always been a fan of older phones style and when seeing this I died. I kind of wish it had a rotary dial, though. I miss those."
4,Great Live Soul,This is a great live Soul CD. The song selection is very good and the sound quality is top notch. Beware though that there are only 15 tracks not the 16 listed on the Amazon track listing. What's up with that? Missing is You make me feel brand new by the Stylistics. Made me mad so I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.
4,I was there,"I stumbled accross this book, and had to have it.I was stationed at Korat AFB, Aug, 1972 to Aug, 1973. I was aAirframe Structual Repair Spec. and worked on every type ofaircraft that is featured in the book.Most of the fine pictures in the book are of the aircraft thatwere at Korat, and almost no picts of the places on base or off.But it's still a great book."
3,"Good value, OK Cable, useless software, works with BITPIM","I bought this item for an LG VX-8700 cell phone. I already had a Verizon cable with an equally useless softwarre, but good driver. The Verizon package costs $30, although it comes with a great thick cable. I ended up using the free BITPIM software with either cable. My advice is to buy this cable, download the USB driver for your phone, then use BITPIM to sync your contacts with Outlook."
2,Cable works but software is a joke,"The software that shipped with this cable had three files on the disk that had obscure names. If one was right, you couldn't tell by looking. To make matters worse, the installation program was in Spanish. I had no clue what it was trying to do. After an extensive search, I finally found a file on the internet that would work with the cable on my phone. What a pain. I now wish I had bought the pricey version from Verizon."
2,USB Data Cable,I still don't know if its my phone or what but I cannot get the USB cable to detect my phone. I gave up and its about to be thrown out.
1,Now working,"Purchased for my EN vx 9900 and the disk was totally useless. My phone is not listed in any directory and most of the files are empty. There are only 2 or 3 executable programs in file directories I could find (none of the files were related to my model phone or one similar) and half of the info that was there is in chinese so unless you can read it you really don't know what is there. If you need just a cable then it might work but the software is a total joke. Also notice that of all the models listed in the description - no software or even file folders were on my disk for those particular models.NOTE:After contacting the seller, Bargaincell emailed the drivers and instructions for my EnV and now I am able to offload my photos. They were very helpful in resolving my issues so I would now give it three stars."
1,USB Data Cable and Driver CD for LG VX8700,The cable USB Data Cable and Driver CD for LG VX8700 just did not work for my phone. I need it to upload my cell address directory but did not work. After installing the software my PC could not recognize my LG VX8700 phone even with different software (Susteen DataPilot).
3,USB Cable,"Good product, but i cant get it to work on my Mac. All in all, it is what i wanted and it should work on a PC."
4,Good Item,"This product worked well with my mint chocolate phone. However, I used windows media player to download music to it, and you must go to sync in the phone's music options (took me a little while to figure that out). It doesn't come with much directions, so you should know a little about computers to use it."
4,"Good cord, useless CD","Everything was in perfect working order upon arrival. The cord is good, but I can't figure out how to use the provided software with my phone. If you just need a cord, it's a great value."
1,did not work at all!!,"I wanted to transfer photos from phone to computer, but computer did not see the phone.....figured need to look for driver...failedpictures still on the phone...."
2,Not shipped as advertised,"The item is listed as a cable and driver CD. However I received a call from the vendor stating that cable didn't come with a CD and that was a misprint. I needed the cable so I ok'd it to be shipped without the CD.Whenit arrived it was in a small envelope via the postal servive. They charged me $4.95 shipping and ""handling"".It's pretty funny that a $1.37 purchase cost me almost $7.00 and I only received half of what I ordered."
2,Not Recommended,"The cable is fine except that it doesn't provide charging capability from the computer. The software is the real problem. I have an enV VX9900, which is explicitly listed in the title of the product, but the CD provided had no software that supported it. Finally went with the microSD option. WAY easier to transfer pics and videos to and from the phone!"
3,"Cable works, but software doesn't work with SHINE","This cable works fine- it's a basic USB cable to plug your cell phone to your computer. It has a long list of compatable devices, one of which is the LG Shine. Indeed, the plug FITS the Shine, but the Shine is not supported by the software provided. Nor does it seem to be recognized using any other software I could find online.The only way I could get it to work is to buy a micro sd card. Then when the cable is connected to the USB port the phone comes up as a USB storage device. The trick now will be to get all the photos that are stored in the phone moved to the micro sd card. It appears to only work ONE AT A TIME!What was LG thinking?? The Shine has a Kick-A$$ camera and no easy way to get them off the phone..."
3,Read all the reviews first and still bought the cable/cd combo.,I read the reviews above so I was fully warned.Basically bought the cable since the CD was pretty useless for me (my brand wasn't listed - go figure) but I downloaded VCast Music Manager and it's patch and the cable works fine for my VX9400.
3,USB cable,The USB data cable was just what I needed for my LG VX8350 phone to transfer music files to my phone. It arrived promptly in the mail.
1,Not Impressed,"Not only did the original package never arrive, But when the replacement arrived the software was not compatable to my LG VX8700 as advertised. I had to find the correct software online. I am not impressed with this product or it's description."
3,Cable for VX8700,Fast shipping but I couldn't get it to work with my phone (LG VX8700) - box was for another type of phone.
4,"Good, but not very pleasant","This is one of Disch's horror novels and - although stand-alone - is a companion novel to The MD, The Businessman and The Priest (the last of which I have not read). As with his other horror novels, Disch breaks away from normal conventions; no one would confuse his work with Stephen King in either content or tone.This story follows the descent into evil of a woman as she becomes infected with the malignant spirit of her father. With her change in character come new and nasty powers.The main flaw with this story is its general air of unpleasantness. There are few appealing characters and the book often has the feel of a rural soap opera. Nonetheless, this is a well-written book and for horror fans, it is a nice change-of-pace story."
3,Entertaining but finally pointless,"Camp Concentration and esp. 334 dazzled...I read them when they were new. I'm a very different person now and Disch is a different writer. I stayed with this entertaining book but always hoping it would surge to former heights and was unsatisfied. Why open the book with a Wiccan teacher at a school struck by Satanic cult hysteria and then drop the school without making any point? An example of it's main problem, as the book seems always on the cusp of generalizing about the nature of Evil but never delivers. The Indian themes were another of its disappointing aspects. The convict shaman was similar and as unconvincing as Tom Wolfe's working-class stoic. Disch might argue he was trying to avoid the cliches of Carlos Castaneda but then he's required to contrive a vibrant alternative. I highly recommend Coyote Blue in which Christopher Moore toys with these cliches to wonderfully comic effect. This book pales in comparison."
2,The Sub-A Study in Male Chauvinism,"A study in Male Chauvinism. that's what this book should be called. I really tried to like this book. But all I was able to pull from it was the author's apparent hate/fear of women. Every female character in this book was rendered in such a way as to cause an instant dislike of them. (Even the 4 year old little girl). I wondered why it was so easy to find at the library, usually new releases are impossible to get. And to list it as horror? I'll pass on this author's future works. Sorry"

1,MISOGYNY,"Misogyny from start to finish. An anti-woman diatribe disguised as innocent-fun horror. If you too are a woman-hating jerk, dive right in, the water's just fine."
2,"As mathematics books go, don't spend your money!","There is a bright light in the iteration theory chapter, but overall it is pretty badly written and dull. The mathematics is all very good, but tastes like old soda crackers!"
1,Stay away,"Horrible product. Loud, slow and less than 5 months in and under 1,000 pages printed and it's smudging every print. Xerox has been onsite twice to fix. It is garbage. Don't buy."
3,Quality of Brunton Pedometer is questionable,"The pedometer is not consistant in recording step numbers. At times it seems the pedometer isnt recording all the steps Im taking. I walk about 40 minutes which I have concluded that I walk a 20 min. mile, and with 40 min,the pedometer should show that Ive walked 2 miles. But actual distant shown is alway under one mile. I've followed all the direction but feel that this pedometer isn't giving me the correct information I'm after"
1,Not worth the price or effort to purchase.,Totally a piece of junk--it did not work from the time it was opened. Not worth the effort to purchase as a gift.
3,"Small, succinct overview of photography's story","Baron's have published a number of good overviews of various aspects of the visual arts. This compact book gives substantial, focused information about most important steps in the history of photography. Sadly, the size requires that the photos be presented on a small scale which detracts from their quality. Because the book includes coverage of sexually explicit applications of photography as a part of its coverage, one would want to evaluate who you would share it with."
3,Unnecessary but still quite good live recording,"Fiery and mellow Jazz guitar competence abound, this slice of an '86 vanguard gig pretty much delivers what is expected and rarely exceeds expectations, but still offers enough enlightened ambiance to reaffirm we are in the presence of a great musician. With only decent audio quality and the discontinued manufacturing, you've got one for addicts of the straightforwardly clean player only."
5,Great if you like Anne Geddes!,I bought this because I love Anne Geedes photographs. All my favorites are included in this day to day desk calender so I get to enjoy a new photograph every day.
3,1 Picture per week is not enough,"I love Anne Geddes which is why I had to buy this calendar, however I expected 365 images or at least duplicate images to be displayed dispersed throughout the calendar. The setup of this calendar is 1 picture from Monday to Sunday and then a new one the next week. Yes the pictures are some of the best Anne Geddes has but more of them would be nice."
3,LACKING SONGS,"I REALLY LIKE CONNIE STEVEN'S VOICE. IT IS SOFT, YET ENERGETIC.LIKE I SAID ABOUT ANNETTE FUNICELLO'S C.D.'S, HERS ARE ALSO LACKING HER MOST FAMOUS SONGS. COME ON WARNER BROS OR WHOEVER HAS THE RIGHTS TO HER SONGS..THIS IS THE GAL WHO HAD SUCH HITS AS ""SIXTEEN REASONS"", ""MR. SONGWRITER"", ""LOST IN WONDERLAND""AND ""WHY'D YOU WANNA MAKE ME CRY FOR"".I HAD TO PAY BIG BUCKS FOR A JAPANESE IMPORT RECORD VINYL LP JUST SO I COULD HAVE THESE SONGS.I MEAN WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE TO PAY FOREIGN COUNTRIES BIG MONEY FOR OUR MUSIC. I MUST ADMIT THAT THEY DID DO AN EXCELLENT JOB QUALITY-WISE. IT'S TIME THAT CONNIE'S BIG HITS MADE IT TO C.D. SHALL WE WORK AS A TEAM AND WRITE TO WARNER BROTHERS RECORDS OR PERHAPS THEY CAN TELL US WHO HAS THESE MASTERS AND THE RIGHTS!"
5,Wonderful CD By Connie Stevens !,Conchetta is Connie Stevens populr standards CD. And what a great job she does.Having the courage to cover songs made famous by people like Judy Garland and doing well prove once again Connie Stevens has what it takes. That is why her career has lasted so long in Hollywood.She is talented enough to last.Connie Stevens fans will love this 1958 CD.
4,Why try to change her now?,"Connie Stevens was a successful TV and movie star who later found a smidgen of fame in the recording business, but today most nostalgia-buffs and pop lovers have forgotten her and that's a shame. Her biggest hit, ""Sixteen Reasons"", isn't here, but there are some delightful interpretations of fine songs, like ""It's A Lovely Day Today"" and ""Slow Boat To China."" Connie's voice has limited range, but why try to change what so obviously works. My only complaint echoes the previous gentleman's: no bonus tracks? most of these songs are 3 minutes or less, which would've given Collector's Choice ample room to toss on some rare goodies. It doesn't hurt to give the listener a little thank you. Otherwise, B+"
3,It's definitely a CompSci textbook,"The variability in textbook reviews are interesting. I would consider this text ""math heavy"" whereas other reviewers believe you'll need another serious text on the matter to round out your collection.I bought this to learn the high level details/processes behind encryption and cryptography but after flipping through the detailed treatment of each, the book got really short, really fast. If you're looking for ""Hey here's DES in a nutshell"" then this book isn't for you. It is in the sense that the three paragraphs preceding the several-page detailed discussion of the DES algorithm are for you, but the rest isn't."
2,not a kefir maker,"this is a great yogurt maker. it will consistently turn out creamyliscious yogurt. this machine has NO THERMOSTAT. you cannot make kefir in it. kefir is made at a comfortable room temp. i was so excited to have something to make kefir in and keep a consistent temp since our house fluctuates temp. this machine does that but the temp is tooooo hot for kefir.product sent is yogourmet. different box, exact same machine. company would not recognize questions about yogurt plus."
1,NO THERMOSTAT as indicated in product description,"This is the beginning of the product description for this item ---""Product Description2 litre (2 quart) container. With Cheese Maker Bag and Thermostat 2 litre (2 quart) capacity plastic container. With Cheese Maker Bag and Thermostat"".......From what I understand this is false - there is NO THERMOSTAT with this product. Amazon or the company needs to correct this error as it is misleading. Please note I have not used this product, just contemplating buying it. So I have no personal knowledge how good the product is, that's why a 1 rating for now since the description is inaccurate.I wish someone, besides the Japanese, would make a yogurt maker that has a digital thermostat so one can ensure yogurt is incubating at proper temps.Thanks for letting me share.Linda Lea"
5,"Catchy tunes and a fabulous, heartfelt voice","Rachel Kershenbaum has a wonderful talent for getting across powerful and complex emotion with her great voice and straightforward and clever lyrics which address the life and love troubles we all face. Though she tells her stories through life experience, her messages are universal. This is a great CD, buy it!"
2,Too Fruity,"I bought this toy for my three-yr-old. She was excited, but then one of the dolls fell apart, its pelvis broke and the legs fell out. Super glue might fix it, but I'm not sure.I'd recommend it for an older child who wouldn't play with it so roughly. But for the price, I wanted it to last more than three days."
2,Waltzes,"I purchased because I wanted the Anniversary Waltz. It was a fav of my parents, with them both gone I wanted to enjoy it again. Unfortunately the Anniversary Waltz was the wrong one. The one I was seeking has the lyrics ""Oh, how we danced on the night we were wed"" this did not. Amazon did give me a discount since I decided not to return it, it does have some nice music on it including Godfather theme and Edelweiss."
2,Look for another printing,Don't buy this edition - look for another one. All the left hand pages are missing about the bottom three lines of text and quite a number of them are so faintly printed that you will be seeing your optometrist if you persist with trying to interpret the text.Teachers hoping for this to be a useful classroom tool will be disappointed and the kids won't like it at all. Shame really because Sarg tried his best as did the editor. The purloining printer let us down.
5,OPERATION IS PLATINUM,"TIGHT ALBUM,BEATS,&LYRICS ARE SUPER TIGHT CANT WAIT FOR ANOTHER ALBUM TO COME OUT LIKE THIS. HOUSTON HAS SOME OF BEST RAPPERS OUT UNDERGROUD TODAY"
2,"choosing your size is not clear and defined, Help me dealer.","I am sure this product would be an excellent buy, but I ordered it and it did not give me an option on size. I am asking the dealer to give a contact address so that I can choose my size prior to shipment. I will post a new review in 2 weeks.Chris"
1,Disappointing,"Underpowered, nearly unusable, without any fine tools. The tools there are do not accomplish the job they were designed for. One star is probably too high."
1,So weak! Worthless product.,"This product has me furious! I am the mother of a 10 month old and as most mothers know, it not about them at all anymore and finding the time to pamper yourself is very tough. Christmas was very small this year with this product being one that I was thrilled to receive (anything to speed up the time of ""grooming"" means the world to me). The device that spins is so unbelievably weak that it stops spinning with the slightest bit of pressure on your nails - don't even bother using the pedicure tools that are supposed to tackle rough and dry skin - the moment it touches your heel it stops. I am baffled that this product is sold by such retailers - don't they test what they are selling? This should have never passed any sort of product testing...what a shame. I don't believe I have ever posted a review but for some reason the inefficiency of this product has me enraged."
3,Language is a barrier!,"The Publisher's Weekly review spoke volumns about this book. It was well written, however for the majority of the students in the class I attended this book left them more puzzeled than informed. One of the reasons the instructor order this title was due to the organization of the chapters. It is broken down according to dates and not periods. This was a novel new way to present art history because you suddenly realize how art periods overlaps. One period does not come and suddenly end, it is a melding of periods, especially in the 20th and 21st centuries. If you already have a basic knowledge of 20th century art this is well worth adding to your library. If you are new to 20th century art ask your instructor to supply you with alternative titles that are written less like a doctorial thesis."
1,Ideological Claptrap,"As a professional art historian who teaches twentieth century art at public university, I find this book to be virtually worthless. Not only do the authors leave out artists from their book because they don't adhere to their own rigid ideological orthodoxies, but the book is very badly written; they undermine their own arguments by constantly lapsing into semi-meaningless jargon. A good postmodernist/ Marxist perspective in a general introduction to twentieth century would be useful, but these authors are too inept and arrogant to bring it off."
2,Like chewing through tough propaganda,"""....an indispensible resource for understanding how our current cultural moment is inflected by changing conceptions of the past"" as another reviewer puts it.It sure is that. It certainly demostrates quiet clearly how some academics choose to reappropriate historical fact in order to fall in line with the narrow, convaluted views and theoretical constructs of a few, who wish to establish themselves as the, self appointed, ""new and improved"" cannon.Far too many ommissions for my liking.Its a huge and relevant Art world out there !!Be warned..If you are not prepared for the language (at least Batchelor of Arts Degree level)you may feel like an illiterate Medieval peasant travelling out of your village for the first time in order to enter the doors of Cologne cathedral to hear a man in a pointy hat speaking Latin !!"
4,better than Sudoku!,"Ok, parts of this book, especially the first few chapters, are really, really hard. But if you slow down enough, you can sometimes figure out what the author(s) are saying. Some of it is clearly written, so there must be at least one writer on board who can write for the educated masses.This book does deal with a lot of issues that are important to contemporary visual artists, especially in the second half of the book. The roundtable discussion at the end is worth the price of admission alone.The reproductions are really good.I taught art history for a couple of years, and I would love to teach a class using this book. It raises a lot of issues that would be fun to talk about in a seminar. I wish I had had it when I was in graduate school in photography."
3,Pretentious writing makes this a tedious read,"I was initially excited about this book because of its sleek design and because it seemed to have a lot of information, including a good variety of art images, but then I began to actually read the sections for class. The writers of this book seem to make it difficult to understand just to make themselves sound smart. There is good analysis in the readings, I just think that it could be written much clearer so that you don't have to read it over and over just to understand one concept. There are also a lot of references that the writers assume you will know, so I wouldn't recommend this to someone who is new at art history."
5,art since 1900,"a remarkable collective work. it criss-crosses the entire twentieth century in complex and fascinating ways. a very important, and nearly immaculate, work."
2,"Great concept, really poor design","I purchased this game for my two children since it seemed like a game that could be played with either of them through various ages and stages. I was also comfortable with purchasing it since we have obtained many Leap Frog toys and games and have always been pleased. Unfortunately, this one is a dud! The concept is great, and we tried really hard to make it work for us, but as the previous reviewer stated, the cards don't stay in the tiles well, and both of my kids found this so frustrating and distracting, that we couldn't have nearly as much fun with this game as I wish we could have. This is one that will be going back to the store...."
2,Great game - HUGE design flaw!!!,"The concept of this game is terrific and I was excited to buy this for my 3 year old for Christmas thinking it would be a great starter game. However, I found that shortly after putting the cards in the slots, that they easily fell out. Very frusterating! I came on this site to find out if others had the same problem and it seems it is a design flaw with the game. Cant believe they didnt know about this when they sold them. I emailed the company voicing my disappointment. Maybe if they get enough complaints, they will fix it. We would love this game if it wasnt for this!"
5,Good collection of rare remixes,"I lost my collection of 12"" singles in a flood some years ago so it is nice to reclaim some of them in CD form in this collection, plus I gained a few new ones I never new existed! Favs include Tears For Fears ""Everybody Wants To Rule The World"" and Steve Winwood ""Higher Love"". overall a great CD and fun to listen to. Brings back good old memories!!"
4,Very good for the price,"I bought this from amazon yesterday as a replacement for my broken one (Sony, but a very old model) and got it delivered today. All I have to do was to was to remove the cover from my pc, remove the old drive and plug this in.My first CD RW that I tried to burn using Media Player didnt burn properly, but I used Sonic Record Now and its amazing. It took less than 3 minutes to burn close to 75 minutes of songs and the audio quality is crystal clear - no static.Please before you burn, set the write speed to 32x (or less depends on the CD RW media). Setting it to MAX is much faster, but at the end the CD is pretty much blank.I rate 4 because I wanted to wait for 2 months and see how it performs."
3,Good Book,"The illustrations in this book are great, but the interactive features are just OK. For example, there is a 1 inch peice of cloth that is supposed to be a tail on an elephant. My 5 month old daughter can't grab this tail and it doesn't really contribute to anything. There is also a ball on a seal's nose that a child can feel. The ball is made out of a shiny fabric but doesn't really feel any different than the cloth used to manufacture this book."
3,PATTIE LABELLE IS NOT ON THE SOUNDTRACK,The title song Preaching to choir by Patti La Belle is not on the sound track. Nor is any of the songs performed in the movie by Patti. for that reason I will have to rate this 3 stars. You just do not leave a DIVA! with a voice like Patti off of a soundtrack.
2,I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!!!,"I purchased this album because I thought that the songs that Patti LaBelle performed were going to be on it. Much to my dismay and surprise, they weren't. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!! With an uplifting voice such as hers, how could her material be left out???Signed""Confused and NOT HAPPY!!!"""
5,WHEN THE PRAISES GO UP!,"THIS CD WILL TAKE YOU TO THE ""OTHER"" SIDE OF ""THROUGH""--WHEN YOU NEED A LIFT, POP THIS CD IN. NEVER, NO NEVER GIVE UP!"
2,Is this Christian?,"I am doubtful that this can truly be called a Christian album. The track Say a Prayer for me is truly powerful however on looking closer the singer is Faith Evans. If you are a blood bought Christian I would advise you to be careful.. I am uncertain why he chose to use her on his album??? I thought he was a Christian singer. Anyway you decide. [...].. Believe it or not a song is more than words, there is a spirit behind it that is poured into and out of the song. God bless her, and her efforts as an artist, but the gift God has placed inside of us needs to be used to bring all, glory, honor and praise to Christ Jesus. The Word says one thing important, we can minister to, but still need to be careful being yoked to the unbeliever. I pray that she returns to her roots and gives her life and music over to Jesus Christ. God bless."
3,I Speak Life,I do not enjoy purchasing a CD just for one cut. The I Speak Life cut is the best of the bunch. The other cuts are just average.
2,Not very impressed,"I was not very impressed with this CD, and it is the first one that I ever purchased by Donald Lawrence. There is too much speaking while the singing is occuring."
4,when suffocation is a good thing,"this album grew on me. I downloaded songs on 'Choke' on ... and absolutely loved them. Initially I was disappointed when I listened to 'Roulette': it wasn't as edgy as the EP. (I bought the album via bellaunion.com, which doesn't have 'Busted' & 'Purr la Perla.') It's fuzzier & warmer, 'trip-hop,' but not spacey. It has this 'heat,' like you're standing a few feet away from a white-hot luminosity. Long story short, I grew to love the feeling & the album.Being a fan of Mono & listener of Cocteau Twins, I wasn't the least bit worried Violet Indiana's gonna turn out to be any less than brilliant. Hope they tour the US soon (can't believe I missed them at SXSM in Austin last year!)."
1,Violet Indiana is not Mono redux,"I'm an idiot. I loved the Mono of Siobhan de Maré and Martin Virgo. I wanted more / moar. So along comes Violet Indiana. Well, golly, I live in Indianapolis, so this has got to be the cat's meow! Nope. Dispirited caterwauling, maybe. I tossed the CD into my recycle bin. Siobhan, we hardly knew ye."
2,Portishead revisted,"The trend towards trip-hop is an ever evolving genre led by those skillful masters - Massive Attack. Unfortunatley, Robin Guthrie is treading in water more travelled by and oversaturated with whiney female vocals. To top it off, originality seemd to got the better of these two, love vocals heard so many times it makes one squeem with disgust. What Robin needs to do is re-release this album without the whiney female pretentious lovesick puppy, and make it instrumental. His swaying feedback guitar is a heaven, but once the demon is unleashed it makes one press the eject button. Take out the Velvet, add bloody and make it a solo of Robin on Guitar, then I'll give it the rating it deserves."
3,LIZ FRASER IT'S NOT,"For fans of the Cocteaux looking for a quick fix since this-greatest-of-all bands called it quits, this release may be a bit of a dissapointment. While the music is the familiar dreamy,swirly guitar echo box landscape--(think Cocteau Twins ""Victorialand"")-- it's missing what only the fabulously original and unduplicated Liz Fraser can provide and could have done so much more with. Check out the Cocteaux catalogue for more info on Liz Fraser releases(especially ""Treasure"") . Nevertheless, if you are unfamiliar with the Cocteau Twins or are just fond of desperate and achy lyrics draped behind a calming surreal setting and sultry feminine drawl, landing you somewhere between Portishead and Julia Fordham--this may be just the thing. For me, it just made me wish the Cocteaux would get back together."
3,Could do better,"Of course it will be impossible for Robin Guthrie to ever live up to the albatross around his fleshy neck that is the grandeur of the Cocteau Twins.Violet Indiana suffers from too much of the same, and not enough that's new. Robin still sounds like Robin, Siobhan sounds kinda like Liz but her lyrics are ..., and the production sounds rushed and amateurish.Sorry. Let's hope for better things down the track."
1,Jason Ellis workout,Ridiculous and the workouts are so unattainable unless you live in a junk yard! I would pass on purchasing this DVD.
4,Terrific Resource,"I have read many books by Brueggeman, and I find him clear, knowledgable and always helpful. This older commentary is no exception. It is deeply scholarly, strongly stated, and thorough. I have been preaching my way through the first 11 chapters of Genesis, and this book was xtremely helpful."
2,Not the intended audience,"I give this book 2 stars not because it is a bad book, but because it does not serve a purpose for me. This book is really geared towards the preacher or teacher looking to use the author's interpretation as a framework for their exposition of Genesis. As I am not a preacher or, formally, a teacher, this book was not worth the time for me to read. I recommend the Word Biblical Commentary by Wenham or the New American Commentary by Matthews instead of this one."
1,Not great,"I wasn't impressed with this DVD...I've always enjoyed Billy Blanks' stuff, but this one was sub-par. Just not for me."
4,The fastest 30 minutes EVER...,"I really like this DVD - it is fast paced, fun, and pretty easy to follow, especially if you've done any tae-bo before. If you get off a beat or two, who cares? You still get a really good workout. I just wish it was a bit longer."
1,should be called child-sized,"This belt is so small it should be labeled as a children's or extra small, especially since it's something you'd wear with low-rise jeans."
5,Excellent early PVD,"I originally had a copy of the video of this years ago, and absolutely loved it. When I found it second hand on cd a few years later I immediately snatched it up. It was only after looking through the sleeve notes I found out it was mixed by Paul van Dyk, who was a favourite producer of mine at the time. It features old trance classics from the German record label MFS, including Cosmic Baby, Visions of Shiva (PVD himself), and Humate. It starts of blissfully slow and dreamlike, but after the tempo change at about track 5 or 6 (which works better then some tempo changes I've heard on other mix cds) it really kicks in. PVD's mixing is very smooth, and this music has aged considerably well... I still listen to it a lot more regularly then I do other more recent mixes."
2,Regret,"Before buying this book, I have bought another book - Linux Kernel Internals which is good but not up-to-date. So I buy this - The Linux Kernel Book for getting more up-to-date materials. I cannot get what I want in it. One of my disappointment is the index, the index is so messy, I cannot follow the structure of the index, so I can't find the materials quickly. Also, the content is organized in a mess also. I regret that I have bought this book, I waste my money and waste my time."
2,Poor translation and bad editing hamper technical content.,"Awkward english usage that appears to have been translated by a computer program and then glossed over by an editor not familiar with English usage and grammar keep this book off my list.I am returning it after reading three chapters. I can't deal with the many obvious misprintings, and the almost unreadable sentences. Sentence fragments and unclear statements abound.The content would otherwise be indispensible to me. Each topic is introduced conceptually, and then the implementation is explained as an overview, and then in detail. I appreciated the space taken for explanations of basic Unix architecture concepts. There are footnotes at the bottom of many of the pages, listing other books to read, and places to go on the web for more information."
2,lack of direction,"Apart from the poor translation quality (some variable names and file names are actually in French), the authors seem quite undecided about the target audience; each topic starts from the scratch, from basic user level stuff before going on to the kernel and implementation. This can be quite frustrating for users who bought the book for what its title would convey. It must neverthless be said that there is no dearth of technical content or competency - provided the reader is ready to wade through what should probably belong to another book for a different audience."

5,This is a true gem indeed!,"Any regular reader of my reviews knows my fondness for Celtic music in general. I've always liked Boys of the Lough and Silly Wizard, so the opportunity to hear work by one member of each group is not to be missed. This is the third recording by Bain and Cunningham (I have all three, and there are not enough superlatives to describe them), and ranks right up with ""The Pearl"" and ""The Ruby"" for entertainment value. Cunningham's fingers fly over the accordion keys, and Bain's fiddle counterpoint is just the right touch. The cuts on this album range from schottische to waltz to lullaby, and each one is a winner."
3,"Love the bag, but the zipper broke!!!!","I do love this bag and seems to be good quality, but I used the zipper MAYBE 5 times and it broke!! Bummer! I am going to try to get another one and hope for the best. Just wanted to share."
1,very poor sound quality,"after a few minutes there is no sound anymore from two speakers, just from the keft one.after 30 minutes the sound and images are not aligned anymore and there is a difference of several seconds between the two. this is very disturbing and makes it difficult to enjoy the movie any further.i have therefore returned the dvd to amazon and hope they will refund me the money."
4,Another Great Book,While there are some implausible aspects to this story it was so well written. I loved the characters. The scenes between the main characters were so steamy they'll fog up your glasses! Definately a keeper in my book.
5,I couldn't put the book down and loved every word of it.,"This book had great characters and the story was believable.I felt like I was right there with Lara unsure if Hunter was really was her husband and if a man could change that much. There was always that question in your mind was this man really Hunter,Earl of Hawksworth. It reminded me of the movie ""Sommersby"" with Jodie Foster and Richard Gere. I really enjoyed the book and now when I am looking for more reading enjoyment I will put Lisa Kleypas on the top of my list."
3,pleasant read--no surprises,"Yes it was a little disapppointing that the author did no more than follow the expected script. and yes it would have been better if there were more than just the one plot twist (for example ""Somersby's"" Jodie Foster having to disown Richard Gere in order to try to save him from hanging). Nevertheless, the story has enough substance to keep you reading and the hero pushed all my romantic buttons--very needy of her tenderness to purge him from his loveless childhood. I especially adored his steadfast devotion to her."
4,Excellent until the last 50 pages,"I have read all of Kleypas's works and find them to be very well-written, entertaining, and compelling. This book fit the bill until the last 50 pages or so, when apparently our author realized she had to end the book. To say the least, the ending is farcical and almost unbelievable. Still, the book as a whole was very good, and although the most of the characters were stereotypes, they seemed to fit in this story. I look forward to her next book!"
2,Skip it,"This story was more focused on the orphanage than the romance, as well as the mystery.But you don't even find out who he is! It implies that he really is Hunter, but at the same time, it doesn't. The ending left me feeling cold. How could she just accept this person as her husband if he still won't tell her who he is?This was just not worth it. If you're looking for romance, skip this one."
4,Rather predictable,"This book had nice character development and writing, but the plot was so similar to Summersby that it left no suspense for the ""mystery"" ending. There is a nice semi-twist at the end, but overall it was rather predictable. I enjoyed the writing and characters, but the plot was a bit thin."
2,Very disappointed.,"I love Lisa Kleypa's work and have read almost all of her books. However this one is not one of her best.The character of Lara is very contradictory. She seems very generous with everyone except her husband and doesn't give him a chance to prove himself. Its the last straw for me when near the end she betrays him. I didn't care much for her up to then, and that did it for me.I really loved Hunter. I thought he was one of the best heroes Ms. Kleypas has ever written. Sebastian from ""Devil in Winter"" being at the top of my list. LOL.I found this story to be very depressing. And there seemed to be so much that was never cleared up."
2,Characters did nothing for me...not her best work,"IF you are new to Kleypas then try Lady Sophia's Lover. Skip this one. The plotline was intriguing, but the chemistry between the Hero/Heroine was lacking. There just wasn't enough substance between them. Blah."
2,Not a winner from Lisa Kleypas,"This does not work at all. There were too many loopholes in the storyline. I'll admit that the first few chapters got me hook on, because I wanted to know whether Hunter was really Hunter.But as I read on, the goodness oozing out of Lara was too much for me to take. Is it to much to ask for a 'heroine' to be more realistic? Lara cares for orphan, nothing wrong with that, but why does Lisa Kleypas potray her to be such a saint. It almost detered me from completing the book.Dreaming of you will always remain as my favourite book of all historical romance. But I am sorely disappointed in this book. The half answered questions in the ending and the sweetness of Lara almost flinging the book far far away from me."
4,Don't Read the End First,"I know, we all like to glance back there, even when we know it is a happy ending, just to reassure ourselves it all work out. Well although by the reviews you may have guessed the answer, just let the author get you there. This book is well worth the read - it's fun, intriguing and you end up pulling for two versions of the same hero! The heroine is a little too unsure of herself considering she ends up as a strong independent woman, but it's not so misdrawn that it'll annoy you."
5,stranger in MY arms,"ok i'm going to make this short! i loved this book. I relaly want the herions name to be changed from lara to laura, becasue that's me name (and hunter is a hottie!)."
1,Disappointing to say the least!!!,"The premise of the story was good, however, the development of the characters as well as the situation culminating to the revelation of who really Hunter, Earl of Hawksworth is, was quite lacking. Lara's/Larissa's character was also so unlike Ms. Kleypas other heroines. Lara is colorless,insipid and so indicisive. Overall, it was disappointing."
1,Painfull read,The so-called heroine was a pain - which cancelled out any potential the plot had. The fact that the interesting hero kept on indulging her made him look a sucker for punishment?
2,The Stranger and the Sanctimonious Miss,"Lisa Kleypas writes books with characters that engage your attention. She tends to use heroines that are so strong and heroic that you can occasionally be forgiven for thinking that they are superwomen but mostly you can empathise with them and the books are quite entertaining. Unless the author's intention was to create huge sympathy for the male character and to emphasize his growth, this particular novel was not up to her usual standard. Most of the central characters were either underdeveloped or in the case of her heroine, an emotionally stunted, self absorbed priggish miss caught up in making herself feel better by doing good works. It was tough going to find any sympathy for her because she seemed to wear her suffering like a hair shirt and no one loves a martyr. She was one dimensional and as a result the book suffered. If you like Kleypas, you'll probably forgive her this lapse, I couldn't make it to the end of this one, sorry."
4,stranger in my arms,"Stranger In My Arms by Lisa KleypasThe earl, Hunter, her husband drowned a year ago and Laura continued on.The servants told her the earl had returned causing her to faint.He's a bit familiar with her but some things are so different from what she remembered.He tells her of things only she would know so it must be him, for real.Hunter tells her all he remembers from the voyage that left him with not remembering his name.The current Lord and Lady were to leave now but their children are in line to get the title.He's got some of the same scars as the real Hunter. Laura is still not absolutely certain it is her husband.She is barren and sold her ring to have money to give to the orphanage where she helped the poor and blind and the children.She has moments where she doubts it is her husband as he talks as if he's her husbands best friend, not himself.Tragedy strikes when her friend and her attempt to trick Hunter when they try to find out if it's really her husband."
5,Worth It!,This is my first book from the author and I really enjoyed reading it. I was quickly captivated by the book and I would recommend it.
4,Is he Hunter or isn't he???,"This is what kept me reading this book all night! I couldn't put it down. The herione was justifiably confused. By half way through I wasn't sure if I wanted him to really be Hunter or not. I loved the plot and haven't read the other book it was based on, so it was original twists for me. Don't start this book unless you can finish it that same day, it's just too tempting!! Kleypas is one of the few highly enjoyed regency authors that I can agree is worthy of high regards."
1,So happy this wasn't my first Lisa Kleypas novel,"If this had been the first novel of this author I had read I would NEVER read another book by her. The main charater is so wimpy, whinny and completely annoying. I kept trying to get through the book, skipping pages in the hopes that it would get better. No such luck! I can't finish it.Stay away from this book!! Check out her Wallflowers series, Someday I'll find you, Seduce me at sunrise, Mine till Midnight or Married by moring. Kleypas women normally much, much stronger than this annoying Lara wuss. This book has been tossed in the bin."
4,Great story,"A great story by the remarkable Ms. Kleypas. However, this book could've been much better.The back cover blurb reads: ""'Lady Hawksworth, your husband is not dead...' With those words, Lara's life is turned upside down. Hunter, Earl of Hawksworth, had been lost at sea. Or so she'd been told. Their unhappy marriage--with its cold caresses and passionless kissed--was over. But now a powerful virile man stood before her, telling secrets only a husband could know, and vowing she would once again be his wife in every way. While Lara couldn't deny that this man with the smoldering dark eyes resembled Hunter, he was attentive and loving in ways he never was before. Soon she desperately wanted to believe, with every beat of her heart, that this stranger was truly her husband. But has this rake reformed--or was Lara being seduced by a cunning stranger?""S."
2,Cherish this? Seriously?,"This was not my favorite book by Lisa Kleypas, to say the least.I was annoyed from the start by the ""Sommersby"" plotline. Knowing that ""Hunter"" couldn't really be the actual Hunter, I found him difficult to like since he basically spent all his time lying to her. I also thought that Lara was a rather wooden character and the whole plot just felt contrived.So there really wasn't much to like, and I plodded through it just to see how they would resolve the matter in the end (knowing that it had to turn out better than the movie did, of course!).But even at the end, several questions remained, as some reviewers have pointed out. For example, how ""Hunter"" would know the details of personal conversations between Lara and her husband is beyond me, and beyond the scope of believability.It wasn't an awful book, but I felt kind of cheated by the plot and its lack of originality, as well as the cookie-cutter characters who exhibited very little depth or realism.Library donation."
2,disappointing rehash of 2 films & beneath author's ability,"From one of my very favorite authors, a real dud. Kleypas does nothing original with the same plot as ""The Return of Martin Guerre"" and ""Sommersby"", the films. The hero and heroine are unbelievably perfect whereas all villains are undiluted evil. The heroine grated on my nerves and at every turn made a decision that made no sense and was against her best interests (until the very end where it should be too late and isn't, making the resolution highly unbelievable). Perhaps the most unbelievable legal proceeding imaginable (I am a lawyer). I cannot believe that this came from the same author who created Derek Craven, Logan Scott and Lawless Lily. Buy and collect this author's backlist as all of her other titles are outstanding! I have kept them all."
2,Blah,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I didn't like this book. I LOVE Lisa Kleypas, she is one of my favorite authors and I have read most of her books but this one just didn't do it for me. The characters are flat, the story felt forced and it honestly reminded me of a bad soap opera. I predicted who Hunter was right off but since I'm ""reading o.c.d."" I have to finish a book once I start it. I was disappointed and sad about this book. If this is your first Kleypas book don't give up on her. She has so many good books, Again the Magic and Love in the Afternoon are amazing."
3,A bit too predictable for my own tastes..,"Although I did like the ""You"" series, I felt this book just didn't impact me as much. I do like Ms. Kleypas' writing style, but after reading ""Someone to Watch Over Me"", I felt this was another retelling with a slightly different twist. It was rather predictable and I was disappointed at how things played out."
5,"A wonderful, romantic story","I really liked this book, the story was funny, dramatic, interesting, I would recommend it."
2,different in person..,"Yes this shoe is very cute, it made it a little hard to return in fact... the picture depicts a nicely fitting shoe but my calf was floating in the sea that is this shoe. It must take a very large calf to fit such a space! And Its not like i'm a terribly thin person either- just normal if not on the thicker side of normal. I've been looking for a nicely fitting brown boot, but this just did not fit the bill. If you're looking for just a cute toe to come out of the bottom of a pant this shoe would be excelent- but too expensive for this purpose alone in my opinion."
2,not very stable,"I thought an underbed mounting system would be great, but I was disapointed. The underbed locking system may work well for a gooseneck, but the fifth wheel adapter rotates +/-10 degrees from center. It is also difficult to lock in the adapter. I didn't like the movement of the fifth wheel adapter when using a regular pin box, and it was really bad when a switched to a 5th Airborne/Sidewinder pin box. The hitch would lock in place off center causing the trailer to tow off center."
2,Better OBX stories out there.....,"I was hoping to find great Outer Banks stories here as that was suggested. Regrettably, I did not find them here. There are definitely better stories of the Outer Banks and surrounding areas. Finished the book wondering why I read it. Try the Charles Whedbee books and David Stick books for OBX stories, both fact & fiction. Wendy Howell Mills & Sarah R. Shaber books are great too! Outer Banks stories by NC folks."
4,Not all it used to be.,"I have this product and have been using it for decades, literally. I ordered one for a friend and it now comes without a lid, which I think is a shame. I refrigerate the yogurt overnight while it is draining and I wouldn't want it open to the air. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars -- it is the BEST (and cheapest) way to make your own Greek yogurt."
1,Not big enough,"My decision to buy this strainer was based largely on another review that said it would hold 32 oz. It doesn't. It only holds about 16 oz, or 2 cups. I have a yogurt maker that makes 1 quart (4 cups) and now I have to strain it in two batches. For some reason the seller of this product refuses to include its capacity in the description. I am terribly disappointed, and wish I had bought the Donvier product instead.Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Cheese Maker"
2,Just use butter muslin,This product is expensive and unnecessary. The mesh seems a tiny too small to effectively drain the cheese. I recommend just using butter muslin; its cheaper and works better. You can wash the muslin and reuse it.
1,unuseful cheese strainer,"The idea of this item is good, but the size is very small and did not fulfill my expectations. Unfortnately,the dimensions were not provided in the description of the product. I kept it only because it was cheaper to keep than to send it back. For the purposes I needed, the size is not suitable."
1,I never received this item ...,I bought this in set of 2011 and we are on Jan. 2012 and I never received this item ...
4,Wonderful history of Eastern Europe Roma,"Though for my research this book was a bit slim (dealing in pre-1600's) this book is wonderful for anyone interested in the Roma people who populate Eastern Europe. Dealing with both the beautiful and the ugly side of human nature, this book captures how the Roma live and have lived in Eastern Europe and Russia throughout history."
5,Gift.,This was a gift. T;he recipient loved it. She said that it helped her organize her thinking.. Good for preparing for Bible Study Group sessions.
3,pictures of San Bernardino,"This book is wonderful for the old pre-1940 pictures. If you could buy these in any other book, the price would probably be tripled. However, there are at least 6 pictures of the author and his family that have no historical significance in my opinion.Perhaps my expectation were too high. I would like to see more of the pre 1950 photos. I would estimate about 100 pages of great pictures and 25 pages of non-interesting pictures."
3,Great Scholars sometimes are too great...,"The book was a great read, but it was sometimes just REALLY dry and boring. There was little to no outside perspectives within the text, and I had trouble interacting with the text. However, Fretheim offered some great insights with the literary aspect of the texts which sometimes challenged me and other readers. If you are looking for a pretty good commentary that focuses on the literary elements of Exodus, this is a great start. Be wary that his scholarship sometimes overrides the enjoyment of reading the text."
4,"Lyrical, poetic love story about a young boy's first crush ... on a macho dancer (4-1/2 stars)","A simple, yet genuinely eloquent and lyrical story about first love, when a sensitive young man in the Philippines falls for a macho dancer he hires for the evening (after selling his comic book collection to do so). Bare-bones filmmaking on a near-non-existent budget, there is just something so genuinely real and affecting (especially via the two male leads), that by the end you may have a tear or two in your eye. A prime example of just how effective and good a film can be, even without a big budget."
4,"Tender, broadening of my perspective and .....","There is a certain sweet quality about the interactions between the characters in this film that I enjoyed. It is different from the usual US gay films. I wondered and watched, and then, found myself enchanted."
5,Pretty good,"Pretty comfortable, ratchet works great for quick adjustment. I had sought out a vented hardhat specifically because of my desert climate, but have yet to test it out in the summer. Blue color makes me easy to find when I am a Project Lead. Hopefully I'll never have to test its impact resistance."
4,I dunno,"I've had mine for a year - not this exact model, but close enough.It is terrific. I love the fast start feature that lets you go right to the movie instead of having to sit through all the idiotic features and trailers that some DVD producers force you to watch and disable the DVD FF buttons.Anyway, this seems to be a fine deck, the price was right, the VCR quality is as good as any VHS can be and the copy feature works great.The only thing I don't like is the remote control unit. It doesn't work with SHARP tv's very well and the volume ocntrol stops working when you go to DVD or VCR mode. to FF a tape or a disk you have to select the mode then select the TV mode again to change the volume on the set. This is annoying.Other than that I would buy another just for the unique features."
1,Same results as others,It worked ok for a year. although I agreed with another reviewer who commented on the bad remote. After about a year it started giving me the bad disc response! I would not reccomend this player.
1,Stay as far away as possible...,I purchased two of these from Target. One unit would not even power up when plugged into wall socket. (Called technical support-he said must be defective power supply and to return it to them and they would send out new one but I would have to pay the shipping to return it!! Forget that! I took back to store at my own leisure and will look for something else.) The other worked but the sound and the lips of people talking were not in sync! I wish I had read the reviews before making the purchase...but for $99 I thought it would be acceptable for what I needed. (One was to be a gift for my sister-good thing I tested it first)
1,Waste of Money,"I've had this unit for less than 3 months and the DVD has stopped working--the counter continues to run, but no video or audio. Very dissapointing. Save the $$ and put it towards a more reliable brand. Just wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing mine!"
1,Terrible piece of useless junk,"I bought this some time ago. The VHS and DVD player do not work. The remote was not the right one. When I tried to find the company to see if I could get the correct remote, there was no evidence of who they were, and Amazon was unable to help me.I gave it a rating of 1 star because it does serve as an interface between the Sony DVP-SR200P/B DVD Player, Black and my analog television."
1,Stay away from Go Video,"I purchased this player from Ecost.com and was over charged. The unit I bought was factory reconditioned, so I figured it would be in mint condition. It never worked on the DVD side when it arrived. These units when not working are to be returned to Go Video for repair. So you are stuck with paying the shipping to them. This will cancel out any great buys you might think you are getting. STAY AWAY FROM GO VIDEO!!!!!!!!!"
1,The bRecford Straight,"Lets get the record straight, Conan was a name made up by authors in a book. I know that Hollywood will try to exploit this as they have done in the past. There is no.... Record of such being ever recorded in history. Another attempt by Hollywood to immortalize Muslim Religion to the masses of people in the USA who try to rationalize the middle east religion as one that is rational. Don't be fooled by Hollywood as they try to immortalize self created beings such as Conan for their personal gains... yes a good movie... but with alternative motives altogether. My Opinion of Hollywood IS not to be taken lightly."
4,Conan the Barbarian (2011),"This was actually a refreshingly honest Conan that harkens back to the books that made him great. This isn't the A'hnold muscle-bound version, but rather, like the books, features a ""pantherish"" Conan equally believable as a slayer or thief. The story did try to accomplish a little too much and did not allow for enough pauses in action to build suspense the way Robert Howard (the original author of Conan in the 1920s), but it got the flavor of the world just right. I am hoping that the sequel, if one is made, will offer more character development and a richer story line that is not afraid to pause."
1,If you like this I hope you die,This movie is a travesty. Literally it is the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. You would have to be born without a working brain to enjoy this. I loved the original it had a great story great casting as many have said it strayed from the r e Howard books but it was still a great movie. This new piece of garbage has none of these redeeming qualities and the only role I can think Jason mamoa would be good in is as one of the daughters on the cosby show as he is an ugly woman with a Jerry curl. Avoid this despise this and if anyone says they like it punch them in the face.
1,One word LAME,"Terrible movie. Worst movie I've seen in years. Lots of boobs in this film, but the boobie prize is the film itself. Original is a million times better. Conan the Destroyer is a million times better."
3,Better than I expected,"Since so many people consider the original CONAN with Arnold to be a classic (even with some of the cheesy and campy scenes), you know the makers of this film were fighting an uphill battle to have the film be accepted.I was not really expecting much, but we rented it any way.I was surprised.It was much better than I expected.They tried to maintain a darker tone that was more consistent with the Howard books.I am sure most people will still regard the Arnold version of Conan to be a classic and this film will probably be forgotten quickly ........... which is kind of a shame, because is really is better than the harsher critics proclaim."
2,This was a waste of money,"OK, I gave it a 2, but it was a B or C movie at best, almost comical in its ineptitude. It screwed up so much of the back story it is amazing. I will not go into it all, but I was very disappointed."
2,Absolutely Dreadful,This movie is an entirely by the numbers snore fest. The action isn't even good and the constant pan out to random landscape travel scenes are beyond tedious. Literally every terrible action movie cliche is included here making this movie a punishment to watch.
1,The WB Network does Conan,"Horrible. The only good thing I can say about this rendition of Conan is it makes the old 1980'a Arnold Schwarzenegger Conan's look like master pieces. Have any of these writers, directors, etc. actually read the Robert E Howard books? Pretty boy Conan falling in love with pretty girl? Since when is Conan a love story?"
2,Meh,Meh. Really expected more of this. I liked the old Conan and I was hoping this would eclipse it but it felt almost like a complete rehash of the story(like so many other remakes these days)
3,Great film lousy disk,Jason Momoa plays a great conan way better then Schwarzenneger ever could the reason i gave it three stars is because the dvd froze everytime i put it in the dvd player and the disk wasnt scratched i think it came from the factory that way i will be buying another copy from amazon very very soon
2,Meh,"Lots of action, but still somehow boring as hell. ""Conan"" had no real charisma or reason for being a supposed badass. In this version, he's apparently just born that way, instead of having spent years in training like Arnold's Conan."
4,Saw it for the first time:,A few days ago and watched it again today and what a fantastic re-telling and re-imaging of the legend of Conan (The first one with Arnold is classic) but this one was told as if if was reality based and has almost all of the elements of a warrior tale that I could imagine as well as the dark side of things. I enjoyed it immensely. And part 2 may be coming up soon in the next 2 to 3 years.
4,Much better than some people are saying,"This remake of Conan the Barbarian hasn't gotten much respect from fans. But I think it's as true to the spirit of Conan as the version from way back in 1982. If anything, Jason Momoa is a more believable Conan than Arnold was. The sorcery was always a problem for these kinds of movies back in the 80s, and while I generally feel like CGI is overused in todays action films, in this movie it is used well. Overall it's much better than the recent ""family friendly"" sword and sworcery films like the Clash of the Titans remake or Prince of Persia. It's nice to see the barbarian back in R rated fighting form. This is one of those movies that you should give a chance instead of listening to all the nay-sayers."
3,"Okay, not great","This movie was entertaining. The ""Conan"" bar was set fairly high by Arnold and though I like Jason Momoa. I think he was better in Stargate Atlantis. If you like adventure, sword play and revenge This film will entertain you but it's not Oscar material"
2,Pretty bad,"This is a very bad movie in almost every aspect, not worth watching it. The original movie was much better."
1,The Riddle of Failure,"I suspected this latest adaptation of Howard's iconic barbarian would fail the moment Morgan Freeman's voiceover opened the film. Sure enough, what followed was a clumsy medley of tedious clichés that lack mythology or importance--that failed in all critical areas: writing, acting, and score. Even the production values brought nothing of interest. Whatever liberties the 1982 adaptation took with Howard's canon, John Milius established a setting that gave weight and authenticity to Howard's artificial mythology, insuring the film would endure the years. In contrast, the 2011 version is nothing more than disposable debris all too common from Hollywood."
1,Bad! NOT badass!,"Sad,just a sad attempt at a remake. So bad in fact,it's not worth writing a long review to explain why. The original was so much better. Watch it if you must,but I bet you will be shaking your head in disgust after doing so....."
1,Just a big mistake.....,Well it doesn't mean a lot blood combined with brutality makes a good movie someone made a mistake on that and produced a terrible movie.
2,Conan Racks Up A Big Zero!,"I so was looking forward to this movie and couldn't wait to it came out. What a big disappointment! The acting was ok, effects were good but the story and directing were sad. It felt rushed to get to the next topic or event with little struggle and no big end."
4,A decent remake!!,I thought this movie was a decent remake of the origional...... except that Jason Momoa is INFINITLY more handsome and better to watch than Arnold ever was! Id watch it again.
3,man movie- worth renting,"Rent it at Red Box for a buck...not great, certainly not bad, but worth renting. Your girlfriend might not like it-it's a man movie. The actor who is Conan is good, weaknes in movie is sub average plot, and some of the fight scenes look a bit choreographed. It's better than the Arnold 80's version for sure."
2,My first Conan experience is my last.,"I've never seen the Ah-nuld version of Conan so this was my first and last foray with the barbarian. Just a dreadful film, the continuity is just terrible and the dialogue inane. When Ron Perlman is in a production I know it's either first rate or a paycheck role for him. This one is clearly a paycheck with some residual deal I'd wager. I think Jason Momoa was cast for his ability to scowl. Rachel Nichols, lacking her natural blonde hair, is sorely misused. She's either a tough, kick-azz heroine or a screaming damsel in distress. She's way too smart for this role. Stephen Lang is unrecognizable and that is probably to his benefit. He can leave this off his resume and deny all involvement."
2,A waste of time,"As a kid, I liked to read the Conan stories. I would rate this story probably as good as many other Conan stories but not among the better ones.I enjoyed the Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. This one is a Disney version of the story. While watching it, I was thinking this is not Conan. Conan is not really a nice guy but to his friends. He does not rescue strangers out of the goodness of his heart, often he is to them amoral.The acting was not particularly good. I did not think anyone was good. Part of the problem is although Jason Momoa is a good actor, I do not think he was allowed to develop the role as it should be done and Rachel Nichols was nothing in the role. Knock out the two main roles and what is left of the movie?On the plus side, the filming was very good. They did spend some money, and they spent it wisely. I particularly liked the sandmen scene.Overall, I suggest giving it a miss."
3,Plot too thin. Violence for violence sake.,"I was disappointed in this movie. The plot was just too thin. There is A LOT of violence and gore in this movie. I have no problem at all with violence and gore when it augments the story, but because the plot was thing, it seemed like the violence and gore were the only point of the movie. Just gore for gore's sake. The acting was very good, but the actors can only do so much when the story isn't there. This movie could have benefited from better writing and more focus on some sub-plots. It was okay to watch, but I wouldn't recommend buying it."
1,Purchased and will never watch again!,"I will say this, Movies that Marcus directs I will be VERY VERY discerning to watch from now on. I looked so forward to this movie. I do not like anime and I've seen anime movie's directed better. ""Any one want a free copy?"""
2,Was this the right Conan?,"Was this the right Conan ? Was what I was thinking throughout this movie. It wasn't terrible, although the thought of a new Conan ( not Arnold ) didn't work for me very well. Every time I heard his name I was looking for someone else. Sorry I guess seeing the original Conan what, some 30 years ago has spoiled me for any future Conan actors. Unless they come up with a incredible movie, which this is not, to clear my mind of the character actor. The opening scene where the boy Conan gets surrounded by those 4 or 5 invaders and beats them all down and chops off their heads? Yeah, that would of happened in real life, a 10 year old boy destroying 5 invaders by himself. That kind of lost me right there. But I bought the movie and i'll keep it and watch it again once in a while. But this new Conan movie didn't even come close to beating the original Conan the Barbarian."
1,"terrible, almost un-watchable.","I like the Conan fiction but this movie is still terrible. Unfortunately its loaded with bad acting and most scenes lack context due to ridiculous editing. This movie is WAY more accurate to the original graphic novel of Conan than the movie with Arnold in it but the Arnold one is way more entertaining. At least it kept it simple and on point. this movie jumps all over the place, has no risk of loss or even unexpected turns. Cliche` is a good term for all the action and drama in this movie.It's to bad because there was real potential for a fun and engrossing movie here that Hollywood just destroyed."
1,Just no,"When viewing the opening sequence, I could tell that this movie was going to be incredible. Unfortunately, it was incredibly bad. Bad movie gimmicks and story telling. Then the first scene with the grown Conan in conversation has him acting like a goofy kid. What? I couldn't make it through any further. About 20 minutes in, I left and found something better to do. Disappointing after going back and reading the first 10 original books."
1,Xena the Barbarian!,"At about the 20 minute mark, I switched this film off - I couldn't stand it any more. This film is camp, idiotic, B grade and no better than a Xena TV episode. Nothing about this film rang true or had any sense of danger or authenticity. I saw the original Conan the Barbarian movie on the big screen as a kid when it first aired and THAT was a great film ... this is not even worth the plastic for recycling.If you liked the original Conan films ... don't watch this. Can I choose minus 5 stars?"
1,"Conan, the horrid pile of dog excrement!!!!!!!","This movie is a flaming waste of your time. Please, if you have any love for yourself avoid this like an STD. Why? Well, only because it is one of the worst movies ever made. The acting is horrible. The film is almost soft core porn. I mean, I expected to see a long blade-like thing slaying people, but not old Conan's man sword if you know what I mean. The acting was bad, the story was predictable, and the way the film was shot was horrid. All in all, an awful waste of time. JUst avoid it and save your time for something more enjoyable, like cleaning the toilets."
4,1 Disc Blu Ray Has No Extras!,"BE WARNED: This version has no extras, aside from the digital copy, which comes with two featurettes. The Blu Ray 3D version has commentaries and other featurettes, so decide whether you want to pay the extra $3 for it. As for the movie, it's a lean, mean, savage beast--just like Howard's original character. I saw it in theaters, and as a Conan fan, my complaints were minor. I'm actually mystified by the many, many bitterly disappointed reviews. Though it does not follow the stories, it takes minimal liberties with Conan's origin, and captures the spirit of the character and the world very well. Fans of the stories will see many of the elements that Howard himself loved to feature in his stories--all-powerful, evil villains, wall to wall action, dramatic locations, and beautiful women. This movie is a shot of pure barbaric action, straight up."
3,I mean...,"Let's all just be honest. The original Conan was not an Academy Award winner for Best Actor or Best Screen Play but that being said this one is even less so. I still like this movie though. I mean, I'm glad I didn't pay the #11.50 at AMC but it is good mindless action."
4,Terrific Movie!,Might even like it better than the original...is quite a good film. Great pictography and Conan is awesome! Supporting cast is good too! I recommend!!!
3,2.5 stars,"I collected all the ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""Conan Saga"" comics in my twenties. These Hollywood renditions are laughable so don't expect much of this movie. Visually, the actors look like well fed, smooth, pretty boys/girls from L.A. The environment sfx aren't bad, the monster animated sfx are noticeable. The curly haired actor looks nothing like any Conan from any comic but I suspect Hollywood goes by pecs/biceps size.The 'acting'? Wow .. can you say 'Hercules' the t.v. series? Yeah. Right there.If you're ok with the Xena/Hercules, you'll like this. 2.5 stars."
2,Very flat movie,"Movie was just O.K. My wife and I had to watch the original after this just to bring our spirits back up. New movies like this, the hero always succeed with no strife and everything goes his way, no moments of feeling utter defeat. With the original you at least felt that the Arnold Conan had to work hard to learn what is best in life ""To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women."""
2,"ABSURD, BUT ENTERTAINING","Okay, c'mon now.... It's CONAN THE BARBARIAN!!!!! My husband and I hardly expected Academy Award winning material when we rented this. We were only looking for entertainment and that's what we obtained. For those of you who don't know the story, it is about a young barbarian (a.k.a. Conan) who wants to avenge the death of his father and entire village at the hands of an evil warlord and his sorceress daughter. Jason Momoa (from Baywatch) intensely scowls his way through the entire movie in the title role. The only reason I did not give this one star is that I LMAO through most of this movie and I have seen far worse movies than this one. It also brought back fond memories of the even more absurd original with Arnold S. It is worth watching if you have seen the original movie or are entertained by movies with absurd plots."
1,no good,This was a piece of crap. Jason was good in Stargate Atlantis but not in this. Maybe it was because of the writers.
2,"Failed remake of a classic. Rent, Don't Buy","If you are a fan of the real Conan The Barbarian with Arnie in his youth, then this movie falls very short!!! It is Conan by name only. My opinion of this movie solely on its own merits still isn't pleasant! It's crappyness is equal to that of ""The Beastmaster"". Plot is weak, acting is sup-par, and all in all it feels like ""The Scorpion King"" without the Rock! There was no empathy for any of the characters, it does little to explain who the title character is or how he got to be where he is. I know it is supposed to be a mindlessly entertaining movie - not an Oscar contender - and it does get the mindless part down. It the entertaining part that is missing! Do yourself a favor: Red Box or rent this before you consider buying it."
4,Surprisingly......pretty darn good!,"Looked great, decent acting, awesome battle and death scenes (some were thoroughly disgusting). My boyfriend and I went in knowing the movie was gonna be lame but there are only so many 3d movies to choose from. Anyways, when it was over we both said "" that was actually pretty good!"". I would watch it again......weird that I never heard anything about this movie."
2,All downhill after the 1st 10 minutes.,"The story is nonsense, and I mean NON SENSE. The bad guy gets the final piece from Conan's father than can't figure out for how many years what to do? I assume PURE meant ""virgin"" and all indications thru out the movie with the bitchy daughter would lead one to conclude that. She drinks the blood of the main female character AFTER she's had an orgy nite with Conan and what? The whole s.....t with the quest to get all the pieces to achieve immortality is pure nonsense!"
3,A Dynamic Character,"I have loved the Conan character ever since I was a boy in New York in 1957 on the farm at 8 years old. I saved my pennies and nickels and bought paper back books and went away to adventure land. This New guy from Game of Thrones is no Arnold, but he is ok."
1,Have 3D Version,"Loved Jason Mamoa in Stargate Atlantis. Just got a new 70"" 3D television. Bought this movie to enjoy both. Extremely disappointed. The movie really sucks!!! I mean REALLY is bad. Poor writing, acting, plot, characters and more. If that weren't bad enough, the 3D version only has 3D in the opening credits and closing credits. The rest can be viewed comfortable in 2D. Don't waste your money buying this one, unless your a porn/gore enthusiast."
3,WHERE'S THE 3D?,"If you're a fan of the Schwarzenegger movie, then this might be a real let-down. Kind of like comparing the Buscema Conan with the Barry Smith version. Arnold's was Buscema's, this one reminds you of Barry's. I like Arnold's better, but this one has it's moments and is quite ""epic"" at times, if you like this type of movie, you proably won't be disapointed. If you, like me got this to watch in 3D, don't waste the money, stick with 2D, while there is some idea of depth, that's it, no gimmicks, nothing jumps out at you, nothing to let know you're watching a 3D movie. In fact I'd go so far to say that my tv, which can change 2D to 3D, did a better job converting the 2D disk then you get with the 3D disk. So save your money, stick with the 2D."
2,TYPICAL ASSEMBLY LINE GARBAGE!,"Never thought I would defend or recommend an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but this was a very bad movie. The Original had a terrible actor leading the cast, but with a great story written by Oliver Stone & good Direction from John Milius it is amongst the top Comic Book Movies ever made. This new one was hard to sit through & I was only able to go an Hour into the show before turning it off. It just looked so bad. I can't recommend this movie."
2,This Conan should have been better,"I did not enjoy watching this new Conan the Barbarian movieas much as the original with Arnold.In this movie the photography, sets, special effects, costumes,movie, stunts and acting are all better than the original.But for some reason I had liked watching the older film versionof Conan The Barbarian better. I think it's because the originalversion told a better story."
2,"Bad, Bad, Bad...","SPOILER ALERT: Evil guy kills boy's father. Boy grows up and kills evil guy. That's it in a nutshell. Even at $0.99 for rental, it felt like a rip-off. Horrible acting and dialogue (cliche ad absurdum). If you have nothing else in the movie queue, are longing for ""Lord of Rings"" type of graphics and you feel ""plant-like"" then go ahead and rent it."
2,Very Weak,Conan material has the elements to be an epic movie. This one falls very short of being more than a standard action movie with nothing that really sets it apart from 100 other titles done like this. I was very let down. Glad that I didn't pay for it in the theater or but the Disc version. Free online is the way to go on a rainy day when your expectations are low.
3,Meh,"This movie is entertaining enough, plenty of action and a lot of violence. The story is somewhat cohesive. The blood spraying out of seemingly every combatant was a little over the top. Rose McGowan is delightful as a villainess. Mamoa was a decent Conan but if you are looking for a classic, stick with Arnold and Conan the Barbarian."
2,This was a decent if not excellent sequel,"I grew up seeing the first Conan, and loved it. It was a classic. This remake was like most remakes good, but not great. It could have been better. Rose McGowan seemed a bit off in her role as the wicked witch. None of the other characters even came close to sticking with me after watching the movie, unlike with the original which stuck with me for years. The new Conan was good looking, but not really that good an actor."
3,cheese and a hot chick,Cheesy like all of the Conan movies. I would consider this a B rate film. The pure blood is smoking hot.
2,Mediocre at best,"The acting is incredibly scripted. The main actor is no Arnie, thats for sure. He grumbles along through his obviously scripted dialog worse than the new Batman.The special effects and costumes are pretty awesome. There is a good bit of gore, which pleases me.It seems like hollywood is always trying to redo classics and it never quite works out. A good example is the new karate kid.Its worth watching if you get it for free with prime. I definitely wouldnt pay for it, though."
1,Better Left Undone,"It's very rare that you have a movie that can't grab me and I've often enjoyed everything the critics hated with a passion. However this movie is inexcusable and outright an abomination. Weak story, pathetic swordplay, the lead guy is about a charismatic as glue and I'm even sorrier to say that the ballbusting beauty who took out bad guys in GI Joe without a second thought is terribly dull. You buy or rent this for one reason - to see Conan and Rachel get busy in the hay. That's all you watch a piece of crap like this for. The specific effects can't even save this flick and there's no real menace, the villain is a joke. There are people in my neighborhood who are more menacing then that when unarmed!!! Congratulations to the producers, you managed to make Arnold's performance in the original appear worthy of a belated Oscar Award and that's saying something."
4,CONAN NOT THE BARBARIAN,"THE NEW CONAN WAS GOOD, BUT,FOR ME IT JUST DIDNT HOLD THE MAGIC OF THE ORIGINAL BARBARIAN!DONT GET ME WRONG,THEY DID VERY WELL,BUT FOR A DIE HARD CONAN FAN LIKE ME,IT JUST DIDNT QUITE PUSH THAT OH YEAH BUTTON.BUT,ALL IN ALL,IT WAS A VERY WELL MADE MOVIE,I THINK YOU WILL ENJOY IT!"
1,sucks,"not good, worst movie i have seen in some years. don't send your money on this total lackluster production. it cost 70 million to make and looks like a syfy channel movie."
1,Wow this was just bad!,"Don't know what the creative minds behind this revisioning was thinking. This doesn't compare to the original at all. The 3d wasn't impressive at all. Just plain ourt bad all around, the storyline, the acting, you name it, well not the landscape. Thank goodness for being able to resale."
2,Average at best,"I found the story disjointed and not making sense at times. The Conan character was not fully explored which made him feel shallow. The overall cast is good, but the poor direction and writing weakened the movie."
3,Left something to be desired,"I had been eagerly anticipating this movie for some time & was excited too being a fan of the 1982 classic movie & the comics; following the production of the film & seeing the trailers online kept me enthusiastic but finally the finished product I saw in the movie theater was nowhere close to the epic I had been yearning for. Despite mainstream belief, this isn't a reboot whatsoever but another vision of the expansive sword & sorcery world of creator Robert E. Howard. Jason Momoa gives an excellent performance as the cimmerian hero & he's truly perfectly cast as Conan though I can't say the same for Rose McGowan's flat delivery as the villainess Marique. It's not a terrible film but it needed more of an ambitious drive instead of it feeling like a rushed story. Still, Nisepl keeps the Hyborian world intact with all it's monstrous brutality & action, & this alone deserves another shot with Momoa in the lead."
1,If I could give it NO stars I would,This is only the dumbest movie ever and that is saying a lot after having watched the original. The original Conan should win an Oscar compared to this turd. No redeeming qualities whatsoever.
1,Worst Movie ever,"Warning:Don't ever buy this blu-ray, because if you watch this in 3D, you'll realize that this movie has nothing coming out of the screen, so the 3D for this film makes it entirely pointless. The film has a horrendous script for it's genre, so it's nothing like the original, However the visual effects are great for this film, but this film is really insulting to all successful remakes, this film also has poorly edited action, and also it has horrendous acting, so I'm warning you don't buy this movie, if you do, it's a total waste of money."
2,Juvenile crap,The original Conan was brilliant because it was un-self-consciously juvenile. This one sucked because it was pandering to male juvenile fantasies rather than being an innocent expression of them.
1,Crom laughs at this flick,"I never thought I would say this but this movie makes the original Conan the Barbarian movie look like a major academy awards winner. Once you get past the nice sets, there's no heart or soul. It's like Star Wars, with characters so thin that if they turn sideways, they disappear. Even the music is forgettable. Give us motives, theology and a feeling of popular culture next time. As much as they ripped off from the original flick, you'd think this would be a winner, but except for the born on the battlefield scene, this goes rapidly nowhere much. I always thought I could write and direct a Conan movie and now I know I could do better than this. Crom on his mountain laughs at this movie and so do I."
1,Great Idea - Poor Actor Performances,"Having grown up with the Arnold version of Conan, as well as the comics, I had high expectations from this movie, given that it's about 30 years later. The original not only had Arnold, but James Earl Jones as the enemy. Now while Jason Momoa looked the part, his voice didn't match the character. I expected not only a slightly deeper voice (like the one he uses in Game of Thrones) but, I don't know, MAYBE an accent? Also speak a little slower, it's not a race to finish your lines. Maybe knowing how badly the movie was going to turn out, they felt they had to get through their lines fast in order to get out of there.And the people who watched it before release...you were OK with it??I'd avoid buying this movie and just rent it if you want to watch it....or better yet rent the Arnold versions. This only succeeded in making me want to watch those older movies anyway."
2,Terrible,"If you are a fan of the books like I am then you might want to see it just to see it. Otherwise it's not worth watching. The special effects are good but Momoa is a terrible Conan. How much does he weigh? 180 lbs.? Hardly fit to be a Cimmerian. And he's not a good actor either.The plot needed more depth and overall it was a complete departure from the books, and that's unfortunate because the books would make a good movie if they stuck to one of the stories. Marique the Sorceress (Rose McGowan) is the only reason I didn't give this movie one star. She played the best role. Other than that this movie was a waste of 112 mins, and an even bigger waste to those who produced it, as it flopped."
1,"Terrible, easily worst movie of 2011","I had pretty low expectations going into this. I'm a huge fan of the old Conan comics and the original Conan movie with Schwarzenegger and understand the inherent campiness. He's a barbarian. He drinks, he kills, he beds women. He's the James Bond of the Bronze age. But this movie had the most ridiculuous plot and horrible Syfy channel acting, it took campiness to a new low. The movie starts with a shot of him in the womb, and his mother getting stabbed in the belly during a battle. His father then cuts him out of her belly during the battle and has time to raise him in the air.The rest of the movie is just as ridiculous. There's some people made of sand, the rules of their abilities unexplained, there's a giant squid, there's a pure blood... it's just all crazy. Just about everyone in the movie, while not exactly A listers, are better than this. Jason Momoa did a much better job being Conan while playing Khal Drogo in ""Game of Thrones""."
3,Surprisingly decent,"It's not going to make you run out and demand that your friends see this movie, but it was a surprisingly decent reboot of the old film series. No particular weaknesses, perhaps a bit of a dated, now-less-interesting story, but fun nonetheless."
2,Mindless entertainment,This movie is no where near as good as the original but is fun to kill some time if you like sword and sorcery stories.
3,Nothing spectacular,Glad I waited until it came out on Amazon Prime for free. It was definitely not worth the cost of admission at the theaters.
2,"Not a bad movie, but I would have waited for this to get cheaper","The 3d in this movie is nothing special, I've come to realize the best movies that look good in 3d are the ones that are either animated,cgi,or loaded with special effects. I rate 3 stars cause I like the movie, however I'd rate the 3d at a 1.2 stars. Im looking to start a 3d movie collection, thus far I have avatar,Conan, and transformers dark of the moon, with alice in wonderland on the way. But back to the movie, the price wasn't worth it especially since this movie only had 2-3 good 3d moments, and 2 of those moments were the beginning and credits of the movie that had the little fire ambers floating all over the place, wait for this to be under 10 dollars unless you are made of money"
5,Awesome Action,"I thought this was a great movie. Yes, the plot was straight forward and there was no twist, but the fight scenes were top notch and rather impressive. I personally prefer a action movie with a happy ending, than a slow, deep plot, with moral delimas, and emotionally wrenching deaths, that leave you unsure at the end. I feel its under rated at anything under 4 stars. By the way, this movie is too violent for kids!!!"
3,A better film than the first but could be so much better.,"I don't agree with all the spite and single star reviews directed towards this movie. Honestly it was an okay effort. The plot, dialogue, and villain could have been worlds better.I thought the actor cast as Conan was terrific but could have been aid with a few more lines, and less campy one liners. The action was top notch the kind of gore and brutality you expect from this type of film. I didn't feel Morgan Freeman's southern drawl fit as a proper narration for the movie and the main females character was completely underdeveloped and unmemorable.I believe if they learn from their mistake the second film will be just right."
2,This movie is terrible,"Don't waste your time unless there's nothing else out there to watch. Ron Pearlman cannot act, he's horrible in this movie...yah he's good in SOA, but whatever.Remember: Watch only if time does not matter to you."
1,How terribly aweful.,I just kept fast forwarding. Good special effects. I don't think I ever want to see another movie ever again.
5,One of my favorite action movies of the year.,A solid cast and thrilling action sequences.. I loved this flick. Bust out some popcorn and have a good time!
3,"Pretty good, right up to the end.","Now we all remember the old Conan series with Arnold as Conan. But thankfully hollywood picked out and ACTOR to play Conan instead of just having a super buff guy ripping people in half. The story was great,although it seemed a little fast paced, and had alot of actiony goodness. The only downfall tothis movie was the ,clearly visible, anti-climactic ending. I was so syked about being able to see this movie in theaters right up until that last scene were everything just fell apart. To be honest the main reason I originally wanted to see this moviee was for Ron Perlman. He didnt get as much screen time as i hoped but i was glad he was there nonetheless. This movie is for fans of all genres. Just try to ignore the ending and you have yourself a blockbuster hit."
1,No 3d effects,I bought this for the great price but there aren't any good 3d effects.Buy it on regular dvd or blu-ray don't throw away ur money spending more money in a 3D version.
2,More of the same,"I believe you're more likely to enjoy this movie if you're young. The action in this movie felt unbelievable, and lacked anything to really draw me into the story. The special effects were exaggerated, which I enjoy, but nothing that impressive. If you've seen the original this movie will probably be a let down."
1,Action but no stars...,"Conan seemed like a a good addition to my Conan collection. I have over 1,000 DVD or VHS in my library. I have to rate this as great photography. The movie, however, is boring. I felt like I was watching a middle-school play. I guess I could compare it to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. There is no there, there."
3,good enough!,"decent action, crap story. starts out great endings just ok! love the game of thrones badass and the orgin of his story but it fizzles towards the end."
2,Eh,Could have been a good reboot of a series. Was just so generic and poorly done. Don't watch it. Extra words
3,Just Okay,Special affects were just Ok. Scenery was nice. Acting was barely Ok. Very average movie. This would not even hold a candle to the original.
2,Really....,"I've read some of the reviews for Conan the Barbarian, and have come to the conclusion that some of these guys really need to get out of their parents basements, get real jobs and lighten up. An entire dialog breakdown, sequence of events and previous story comparison is a little much!Its a remake, pure and simple. There really isn't anything special about this movie that will make it stands out. Some of the stunts are reminiscent of Indiana Jones and National Treasure.Most of the acting is B rated at best, dialog is flat, some of the story flow is dis-jointed and most of the action scenes are ho-hum, much like the rest of the movie. I don't think its bad for what it is. I am glad that I didn't spend the money and a Friday night at the movies to see this.Its good background noise, not much too it and having seen it once, I can't really brag on it."
4,"movie is ok, Jason Momoa makes it worth the while!","After watching the Conan with the governator in it, there were a few pieces missing in this one. However, Jason Momoa playing Conan is absolutely perfect."
1,What a bust...,Nothing beats the original! No character development in this coarse attempt to improve upon a classic. Blood and gore is overrated.
1,Simply Terrible,"I grew up on Conan comics, so my perspective is biased in favor of this classic barbarian. That being said, this movie is simply terrible! While I must admit the actor playing the part of Conan of Cimmeria does do justice to the comic book illustrations, everything else - script, plot, acting, etc. - was an insult to die-hard fans. You will be better off watching the original with Arnold Schwarzenegger (at least you can excuse the short falls because of when it was made) . This was a lazy remake that, even though I saw it for free, leaves me feeling robbed - 113 minutes of my life I will never get back. Unless you are watching drunk / high, or you get a kick out of really bad movies, look elsewhere for worthy entertainment."
1,"Terrible, Terrible Acting",The special effects and action scenes of this movie were good. Too bad that the acting was so poor that it turned it into a B movie. Just awful...
2,Not even close to Howard's vision of Conan,"I've been a fan of REH since boyhood, in particular the Conan stories. As a fan, I was looking forward to this movie with great anticipation. Well................ I just finished watching it and, to say the least, I'm disappointed.Character development was basically non-existent. The plot was shallow. AND to make matters worse, Conan is not portrayed as the biggest, baddest, strongest cat around. Conan gets his butt kicked one-on-one several times in this movie. Talk about a departure from Howard's vision."
1,It stunk,"The first 10 minutes of this movie was cool. After that, bad graphics, bad acting and overall everything just looked like someone spent an afternoon making this on their mac. Save your money."
1,crap ass job,"this movie sucked the biggest balls i'v seen in a long time... the original was not that great and to come back 25-30 years later and do a worse job ... i thought it impossible but i was mistaken ""sigh"" when are we going to make somthing worthwile?all in all i recomend you save your money and watch somthing else"
3,These are the reasons I didn't see the film yet.,"1. Should have use the Basil Poledouris score. It is just so good.2. Wrong casting for Conan. Look at the comic books and previous movies, you want emotion in the face, and unfortunately he doesn't have none."
1,FAILURE,history teaches us that the remake is never better then the original including.....planet of the apes....the stepford wives.....flight of the pheonix.....the amityville horror.....I spit on your grave.....AND.....conan the barbarian.
5,Conan 2011,"Conan 2011 rocks, Jason Momoa is freakin killer in the title role...he had the attitude the look and the brutal skill set of a savage Barbarian, I watch a lot of movies that involve swordplay and I have never seen someone as vicious and skillful as Jason in handling a big sword or broadsword on the big screen.As much as I loved the movie, I saw where they dropped the ball in making this movie absolutely mega, the editing was a little choppy and the script could have been bumped up in some places of the film, but the movie more than made up for the weaknesses with brutal mindless mayhem and high adventure from beginning to end.When all was said and done...I had no doubt that I had just seen Conan do his thing in the Hyborian age, and for me that adds up to a great time."
2,Sucks A**,"Damn. What a waste. It's down there with Krull, Beastmaster, Scorpion King and all other 'B' fantasy-adventure flicks. Mostly a sword-fest, if you're into that kind of stuff.What I miss the most from the first version was the spectacular soundtrack from Basil Poledouris. Even though the first one was mixed in Mono (see IMDB), it still sounds better than the 6+ channel, ultra bit-rate audio from this version.The first version also had this interesting charm and simplicity. Arnold's gift was using body language - so he didn't need to speak at all in his most famous roles.Perhaps this one is closer to the original story-line but I'd rather watch that interesting Abraham Lincoln, vampire movie instead. That one was more believable - LOL."
2,"Momoa version lacks music, bulk and live action.","Momoa cant hold a candle to Schwarzenegger in this movie(size wise). He is too skinny, and its very evident in his lack of arm size. Hardly any tricep muscles. Also, his goofy facial expressions made him look like Brendan Fraser ala the Mummy. The music score is just bland, lacks power and emotion of the original. WAY too much CGI, the cartoony sand monsters were laughable. The villian was pretty ho hum boring. They should have had him dubbed by James Earl Jones. Weak movie.. watched it once, and have no intentions of watching it again, or any sequels. Reboot? No, just boot this to the trash can. :)"
2,Waste of time,"Although this probably jibes with the story of Conan, he doesn't have much depth to his character other than a revenge seeking, womanizing warrior. The film carries little in the way of a good story. If you're wanna see a bit of gore, this might be an alright movie for you, but other than that, there are a lot better strong, warrior films out there."
