5,More Than Inspired,"I have just received this CD and I have listened to it 3 times now. It is such a beautiful tribute to Neil Diamond's music and Fawzia Begum is such an amazing and talented lady, you will not be disappointed if you buy this CD. Her renditions of Solitary Man, Holly, Holy and Shilo are so much fun to listen to and the Reggae beat in The Last Picasso and Beautiful Noise are wonderful. Also, Fawzia's own compositions of Solitary Song and For You are really ""inspired"". Just lovely music and worth getting and playing."
4,Very very good,Shows what a military officer needs to read and how to apply it to get an inner foundation for effective leadership. This is certainly not just a bibliography listing of books!I was happy to see that I had already read a number of the suggested books but there was plenty of new material to go find.
1,Kindle version is useless,"I thought it would be nice to read this sheet music from an iPad, but the kindle version is terrible for that. The resolution is way too low."
4,Do-it-yourselfer book,"I'm a bit mixed on this book. One part of me loves it all to pieces and wants to suggest it to everyone. Another part of me thinks it has a few too many health errors to be worthy of five stars.The not-so-good side of this book is that the information has become a bit dated. A critical reader will wonder if some of the information is backed by research or is purely experential on behalf of the midwife.One thing that makes this book worth the money, though, is the arts and crafts section at the end of the book. If you need to make your own materials and you're on a tight budget (or standing in the middle of a developing country holding this book) you will learn to make everything from a uterus model to a timer using McGyver-like creativity.It's a book I would strongly urge travelling midwives to carry because it is so malleable. It's a book students midwives will probably greatly enjoy - but please don't practice until you have done better research."
1,not a bargain,"I was disappointed in this booklet. It consists of copies of old Lionel operating instructions as shipped with product such as the 97 coal tower. Then it just extracts a few paragraphs from that original manual. I found very little of use in this booklet, a disappointment for $9.00."
1,"great soup, not from here though.","I LOVE this soup when it's bought in a grocery store. For whatever reason, the soup we bought from Amazon tasted cardboard-ish and I've thrown some out after cooking it. The same soup from or local store is a staple of our weeknight dinners. Very good stuff."
3,one of the better prepackaged foode,"I typically don't like prepackaged food. This was one that is ok. I still think it is a little too salty but If you buy it for your emergency preps it taste all right, and I can still palate the taste on days when I don't have time to cook or I need to rotate my stock."
3,Too salty,"Enjoyed the minestone soup, but it was much too salty. Would like it much more if not so salty.....i"
2,A dangerous misleading product if you're not already familiar with Brazil,"This product is inaccurate and out of date. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT LEAST UNTIL IT IS UPDATED. It does not distinguish between paved roads and dirt, crater filled, alleys which will ruin your car and expose you do dangerously low speeds in areas where security is poor. It shows intersections where there are none and misses real ones entirely. It recommends illegal left turns, often in places where it is a divided highway. If you need a GPS enabled map in Brazil, so far it's safer to stick with Google. It may be slow, but it's much more accurate and it's free."
3,Not what I expected,"What I expected: Hazelets Facial Pads with Aloe, 50 Wipes.What I got: Hazelets Facial Pads with Aloe, 50 wipes - in a plastic jar, very similar to Stridex or Oxy pads. I was expecting individually wrapped wipes, the description didn't give any indication, so I just assumed it was individual towlette-type wipes, which it is not.That said, they perform exactly as I expected them to, they are a freshing wipe for cleaning dirt and oil off of your face."
1,Deceiving,The two songs I really liked in the movie are NOT on this soundtrack (KT Tunstall's ''Suddenly I see'' and Belle and Sebastian's ''I Don't Love Anyone''). I could understand Belle and Sebastian not being on it since their song was playing in the background (in a bar) but Suddenly I See is playing during the opening credits AND it plays for like 3 minutes!!! It really should have been on this CD.I really recommend you check the tracks before buying this. I'm not happy with my purchase.
2,Way too expensive for what you get.,"For such a cool movie, this is a disappointing soundtrack. The music is one of the things that makes the movie. The soundtrack sounds like something the producers used for a trash can (hmm don't need that anymore, let's throw that in there...that too, that too, etc). Come on, Vogue?? (no pun intended) Two Madonna songs on the same soundtrack are two songs too many for me. And Vogue is ancient. The worst tragedy of this CD is that they neglected to include KT Tunstall's song ""Suddenly I See,"" which opened the movie. The only way this can be perceived as a good deal is if you run out to Wal-Mart while they are still selling the package deal (the DVD and this lame CD) for under twenty bucks. Then you'll basically have to download everything else that you want that they left off. Sad, sad, sad."
1,Incomplete Soundtrack... But for a reason...,"I agree with all other viewers who harshly claim that this ""The Devil Wears Prada"" soundtrack album is incomplete.Keep in mind that K.T. Tunstall (performer of 'Suddenly I See') is one of those artists who protect the copyrights oh her musical work as pure gold or precious gems.Therefore, not being the WEA edition of this album a ""COPY PROTECTED"" one (very common actually in some Brit-German-European CD editions), she hasn't allowed the song to be included in the final version of the soundtrack.It means, if you really go crazy for having K.T. Tunstall's ""Suddenly I See"" at the touch of your hand every time you want to hear it, get her 'Eye to The Telescope' album, and simply avoid buying this really irrelevant compilation of songs titled as ""Original Soundtrack""...However if you loved the great performances that Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway developed in this film, get the DVD of the film instead!"
2,Just good enough,"The songs on this soundtrack are good, but too many of the ones in the movie are missing, especially the theme song by KT Tunstall. I would recommend buying it used."
4,The Devil Wears Prada...,"Being a man that's not into fashion, I avoided the ""Devil Wears Prada"" like the plague! Well, one day, it was unavoidable and I caught the movie about 20 minutes in. I actually found myself interested, then actually liking this film. The choices of music definitely help set the mood. My favorites: Vogue by Madonna and Here I Am by David Morales.Four stars for the soundtrack!Note: The version of ""Here I Am"" is short on the Soundtrack. I found the longer ""Kaskade Remix"" of the song on the ""Ultra Weekend"" collection for only $6/US + Shipping - a good deal."
3,Where's Tunstall?,"I really like the soundtrack. I went track by track through the CD list and what's listed on the end credits and it is fairly close. But that song at the start of the movie, ""Suddenly I See,"" by KT Tunstall, really sets the tone for the whole movie. You at once understand that the invisible force driving all the characters is our culture's obsession with physical beauty, the amazing amount of beauty we do show, and the way the fashion industry shapes and reacts to it all. It's a lighthearted but thoughtful song and its absence is really noticeable. If, like me, you bummed out when you realized you'd missed something so core to the movie, you can also, like me, go buy KT Tunstall's album Eye to the Telescope and enjoy that one."
1,"""lacking favorte track""",I must stop buying soundtracks of movies that I like: appanrently not all of the songs that I am fond of are on a soundtrack CD
1,Not the CD I had ordered.,"Product case was internally damaged. CD was NOT what I had ordered---instead of the advertised product, I received a CD that was some sort of a knock off with only 4 of the 12 advertised cuts."
1,dissappointing,We returned this CD. It had tracks that weren't in the movie and did not have our favorite from the movie. Very misleading to call it a soundtrack
3,pretty good but lacks something...,i agree with the first review. the soundtrack seems to be lacking a few important songs such as maybe the opening scene song??? ahem yeah that might be a little problem.
5,Great soundtrack to a great movie from a great book :-),"I loved the book so much, I loved the movie too and now I get to love and enjoy the soundtrack. It's really good and does have a lot of the songs in the film.Even though Vogue is older and tired, it fits so well into the film as does the fantastic version of Crazy that Alanis Morrisette does. The other song I really love is Tres Tres Chic. There is a bit of something for everyone here because it's an eclectic mix of music. I'm sure you'll love it if you loved the movie. I definately do."
1,"Falta una cancion, Song is missing",Malas noticias Suddenly I See de KT Tunstall (Album Eye of the telescope) no viene en el disco....Bad news..the song Suddenly I See from KT Tunstall (Album Eye of the Telescope) doesn't come in the Disc
3,Good not great..,I think this really helps the ammonia eating bacteria population but does nothing for the nitrite eaters. It took me 2 weeks to cycle using this and seed media from another tank. Once nitrite spiked it was 5 days before it dropped to 0.
1,"Open bottle, half empty","The item arrived on time, but unfortunately the bottle was already open. The safety seal was peeled up inside, so the fluid leaked all through the box leaving me with only about half the bottle left. Very disappointed in the packaging and quality of this."
4,only 4 stars because...(read on)..,"This was a great package of ""goodies"" from the label which sponsored Kylie's ONLY intersting period, in which she showed actual talent and creativity (before she became a ...pop sellout;). The only problem with it is that besides the great inclusion of rare-b-sides and such, it only includes 3 songs from the Impossible Princess period. It is a criminal exclusion of the brilliant song ""Cowboy Style"" which WAS a single, and in my opinion, her best song to date.Nevertheless, it's nice to know that SOME of the material representing her great artistic period is getting some representation/summary, and wasn't just thrown out by Deconstruction."
2,A bit confusing.,"I am taking my first college business law class (I also took it in high school). I expected a college level course and text to be more advanced, but I have to agree that this text is a bit confusing. If the tests were based on the text alone, I do not think I would do well on them. Thankfully, my notes from lecture and use of the study guide are saving me. I'm used to reading once, retaining the information and focusing more on the additional information provided in the lectures. I cannot do that with this text. I read the chapters two or three times and still feel confused. I have a 3.9 GPA and I hope this class (or should I say textbook) doesn't ruin it for me."
2,Mediocre,"This edition is one of the better editions to come out. My professor didn't use the book in class, in fact he gave it bad reviews. We were advised to have the book to look up topics in more detail. We were also advised to study the chapter review questions, as they were used as test questions.As the first reviewer said, the book does take the long way around subjects and tends to leave you confused when you actually try to read it.As for the other reviewer, Spiral, I'm sorry you paid for a college education that didn't teach you how to spell.utalizes is spelled utilizes and virtualy should be virtually"
5,"Maxell HG should be called ""How Great""","As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" as well as an avid music collector, and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write about and or discuss various recording tapes.Maxell HG T-120 VHS Tape-Maxell's stellar reputation for VHS and cassettes tapes have been a staple of the industry for decades.The Maxell HG will give you terrific clarity and the ability to preserve the recording if you plan to use it only one time or be durable to erase after each viewing.Please make sure the VHS heads are clean or the tape will not give you the optimum results regardless of the brand.A quick note that even if the 8-hour VHS tape seems like a bargain, stay away from it. The standard of the industry is six because anything above means a thinner tape has to run through the machine and is absolutely more susceptible to breakage.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"""
4,they tried hard,The seller sent them late but called to notify me & apologize. Tapes are good quality AND i WOuLD RE-ORDER LATER W/O HESITATING
5,Lovely Little Urban Storybook,"This book was a favorite of my son's for many years, from early childhood right through kindergarten. The story is silly and engaging - a great jump-off point for make believe, and the text is within the reading range of a first or second grader, especially with help from a parent, teacher, or other caregiver.The illustrations are beautiful. The colors go from muted yellow depictions of uptight train riders to a full on red and fuschia and teal calypso party, back to the yellows, with a nice bright splash.The pace of the book and the color progression of the illustrations echo the primary event of the story: a train ride. Nice touch on a sweet story."
2,Sales Prospecting for Beginners,"Mixed in with many rather boring stories are little pearls of wisdom that all beginners in sales require. I have yet to hear any sales person or trainer NOT say ""Learn about your client"", ""Listen closely to what your client says"", etc. The basics are certainly there. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be much more than that. Creating distinctive marketing segments, creative approaches to prospects, analysis of sales successes and failures, along with all of the techniques required to become a top salesperson - except in real estate I guess, are sadly lacking. I expected much more from this book."
2,"Very elementary stuff, not that informative.","The book contains very, very elementary stuff, not that informative. I imagined since this was a Tom Hopkins book it would have some really helpful tips, but it didn't."
1,Not very informative,"Most of the text is war stories meant to glorify the author. He has no experience at selling outside the field of real estate. Because of that this book has little of interest to those not in that field...and not that much for those in it. If you sell real estate there are far better books out there for you on how to build your business. If you sell something other than real estate this book is of very little use. Mr. Hopkins primary talent seems to be that of promoting...primarily himself. It may well be that his blend of self promotion played well in selling real estate years ago, but he is not a student of selling and is not in touch with the real world as it now exists. There are much better books out there on prospecting."
2,Should be Sales Prospecting for Real Dummies.,Nothing really new. Seems to be one of those books that is written to make money vs. advance the knowledge base. If you are new to sales it maybe worth your time but that is it.
2,I am a Pencil,"""I am a Pencil"" by Sam Swope is a great story about a gifted teacher from New York who helps kids of various ethnicities learn to write different types of poetry. He takes on a huge reponsibility by helping these struggling children learn to progress in their poetry writing skills.This book was one of the best books that i've ever read. It provided me with a lot of insight on how many schools in New York operate and what they teach. I loved how Swope not only worked hard to help these kids at school, but he took them to places they've never been before and showed them that there's life outside of New York City. I would reccomend this book to someone who is a teacher because it is very inspirational and will help you become a more caring and creative educator."
4,"Good CD, but not worth the money","This is a nice collection of the Cardigans' hits and b-sides, but I don't think it's worth spending $35+. Instead, I suggest you buy ""Other Side of the Moon"" which contains all the b-sides featured here (with the exception of ""Pike Bubbles"") + a few more b-sides for about 10 bucks less."
3,Beyond the Chocolate War,"I think this was an okay book. The only problem that I had with the book was that the begining was boring, but as I started reading more of the book ,it started becoming interesting. It came out to be a good book."
2,Downsides...,"Using the computer all day, I am very picky, so this review may not be for everyone. The wireless portion seems to work well - only a slight lag. The mouse is very heavy, and after moving it around constantly you being to feel it in a an hour or so. Lastly, who doesn't snack while they work. The matte black finish on the mouse stains immediately - potato chips being the worse culprit."
2,Baseball signs,"Ive enjoyed baseball since I was a kid living in the Boston area. I lived very close to the then Braves Field, and a long walk, or trolley ride to Fenway.The book. Interesting in many ways but the understanding of the many signs used, for me diminishes the joy of watching or listening to a game. What I have always understood the game to be was a batter trying to get on base in order to score for his team. The background stuff was secondary. I like it best when they just play ball."
5,Awesome Book!,This is a fantastic book for baseball lovers. My son is in high school and just loved it!
2,Expensive Coasters,"I've been getting 2 or 3 ""cyclic redundancy"" errors on nearly every DVD+R used for data so far (6 of 7). No software detected errors on video DVD but 2 or 3 very loud shots of static in the movie lead me to suspect similar problem. Have had 100% success, no data errors at all, on Memorex and HP media - at twice the cost, though."
4,good dvd-r but bad value,"these dvd-r work perfect, no problem ever writing with them, they work on all my multimedia devices that support dvds but i believe these dvds are to expensive, but i dont use my bruner but like once a week so i wouldnt buy this much at once for this price, but for the bigger spender consumer its a great value"
2,Unreliable company.,You can never rely on Verbatim for quality disks. Verbatim does NOT make their own disks. they constantly change manufacturers. How good the disks are depend on who really makes them. the disks made by RICOH are excellent but you see more of them made by MCC and other companies. I have a spindle of 30 of the MCC and over half have given bad burns. the Sony DVD+R made by RICOH gives perfect burns using the same methods. for a good quality media at a decent price Ritek is really the way to go.
4,Great little piece,"This is a hard book to hunt down, but its a little gem of a book. Wilkes does a good job in the intro chapter of distingushing thought experiments from other kinds of experiments and philosophical methods, and then gives good reasons for skepticism about thought experiments when it comes to the philosophy of mind. Given that the personal identity literature is filled with fantasy thought experiments, Wilkes' approach is a breath of fresh air. Dennett fans may especially want to give this a try."
1,How hard is it to make a mouse pad?,Too hard for these guys! This is a piece of cheap plastic with a dark picture on it.
3,Mouse Pad,This mouse pad is pretty but extremely thin and flimsy which I did not know when I was purchasing it. It replaced a thicker pad and just seems cheap compared to my old one. Sheila
4,Granny is cool,"Granny torrelli makes soup is about a girl named rosie and her Granny,and bailey. They are in a fight because rosie can do every thing that Bailey can't. Bailey is blind so he can't reading, see, or even play with out some one giving him help. I don't want to tell you the whole story, so read on."
4,Granny Torrelli makes soup,"I all began with a fight. Rosie, the main character in Sharon Creech's novel Granny Torrelli makes soup, is so mad at Bailey she can't stand him, but when her grandma comes into town problems start to get solved.Rosie loves when her grandma comes into town with her heartwarming recipes, lessons, and childhood stories. Whenever Granny Torrelli starts to make her famous soup she starts to tell stories about her childhood. One of the stories she tells relates to the problem she's having with Bailey. After she tells Grandma about the fight grandma gives her lots of advice. To find out what happens with there friendship read this book.I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it. I liked this book because of the love, friendliness, and stories. I would really recommend it to ages 10-100. I loved this book!"
4,Sharon Creech does it again,"What can I say. I absolutely love the work of Sharon Creech. This book is another success for her. I read it with a group of 9 4th grade students in my class and they just really got it! The honesty, compassion, and desperation of maintaining a friendship against all odds is striking. It's a very quick read due to the way she sets it up, almost like a script. In fact as a follow up activity I had my students write scripts with Granny Torrelli, Rosie, and Bailey as the main characters. Because of the strong character development within Sharon Creech's book, the students were able to really develop their scripts. I highly recommend this book to both boys and girls alike."
4,I want an Italian granny!,"This book grabs you right off the bat, wondering what ""that Bailey"" could have done to upset Rosie so much. The story comes out through a series of flashbacks from Rosie & Bailey's past as well as from Granny Torrelli's experiences. When it all comes out, it is very ""real,"" something that could easily happen with the people we know and love in our own lives.The writing seems clipped (is there a single sentence of over ten words?), but it works. It just draws you more to the story of everyday friendships. I envy Rosie's relationship to her Granny, talking about her problems while working together in the kitchen."
5,you can't put the book down!,"you just have to keep reading and reading and reading. Because this is a short read, you understand easily what the book is on!"
3,my statement,this book is about a girl named Rosie and a boy named Bailely and their friend ship.when a new girl moves in her name was Janie. She met bailey and she started to take over bailey and All ways comeing over to his house. this made Rosie realy mad.what will she do? you have to find out by reading this book!
3,That Bailey,"The book ""Granny Torrelli Makes Soup"" is an alright story. It's about a girl named Rosie who is mad at her best friend, Bailey. Bailey had got in a fight with Rosie and he told her ""Get over yourself Rosie."" Rosie went over to talk to her grandmother, Granny Torrelli, and ended up making 'zuppa' with her. As they talked Granny realized that she to had the same problem when she was younger. As they talk Granny gives her some life lessons that helps Rosie apologise to Bailey."
5,a must read,"Rosie lives right by a blind boy who she is friends with. She helps him out, and she always has ever since they were kids. That's when a new neighbor moves in next door, and starts helping the blind boy out. Rosie right away becomes jealous of how much time the new girl is spending with the blind boy. Then Rosie's grandma (Granny Torrelli) gives her advice and Rosie in the end stops being so jealous. Then at the end of the story some more new neighbors move in on their street."
5,A moving novel in a general way,"Rosie and her best friend Bailey had been having a fight.Bailey is a braille child and has alwayds felt better taht he could at least do one thing that his pal Rosie can't.But when Rosie goes ahead and learns anyway, he yells and screams and throws her out of his house.Rosie goes back home, trembling with anger and rage and finds her optimistic and kind Granny Torelli making a traditional italian soup in their kitchen.When Granny Torelli sees Rosie so angry she immediately suspects a fight with Bailey, and because of her belief that the two young children may one day marry she tries to help Rosie regain her love and trust in her best friend.Then Bailey enters the kitchen and the two friends are back together, until the beautiful girl next door comes along......................Read this heart warming short novel written by children's beloved Sharon Creech."
2,"the soup might be good, but the book isn't that great","This book was a disappointment to me....Creech's Walk Two Moons was such a great read, so this book left me thinking it was just ""fluff."""
2,more of a pamphlet than book,I like this authors books and his subject matter. This book is only eighty eight pages long with no index and twelve blank pages at the end. I understand that this is an excerpt from the authors previous works but it is a poor job of publishing and does not justify the 18.95 price. In my opinion this is a ripoff. If you want to experience what he has to say read the oter works they all have the same theme orthodoxy versus modernity. I would avoid this book it is put out there to take advantage of the ufo theme which is ironic because the author hates all such books but still seems willing to take advantage of the market.
2,pink ring,"This ring was cheap looking when I got it. It was packaged well and fit okay. It just looked cheap. The seller was awesome. They refunded my money without any questions or hassle. I will buy from this seller again, just not rings like this."
5,"A Great CD/MP3 Player, but why pay $80.00 extra right now?","Before I give my review, why are people paying $80.00 for this product insead of getting the just as great SlimX iMP 350. There is actually no difference, except for the remote. On the 350, it uses 75 degree rotating dials on the top and bottom for navigation. It's no hassle to change music. On the 400, it uses a d-pad and center enter button. Both have there pros and cons, but each in it is equal. Now for my review. SlimX makes excellent products (minus any CD player less than the 350). This one is no exception. It has excellent sound quality, excellent battery life (around 12 hours on a charge), and has great skip protection. Also, how can you go wrong with being able to carry 6 hours of 128kbps music with you? If you want to spend a little more, go with a Nomad Zen (excellent bang for the buck). Other wise, if CD's are your thang, go with the SlimX 350 or 400."
3,Top of the CD MP3 player market.,"CD MP3 players are quickly becoming obsolete, why go to the trouble of burning CD's when you can just upload songs 20 times faster. Memory wise CD players are super cheap, 1 CD costs about a 20 cents compared to the big bucks for spare memory cards, that to me is the only advantage of CD MP3 players. CD players are big and bulky and not easy to fit in ones pocket. The no skip feature is touchy at best, sometimes it great sometimes it isn't. Battery wise, its inevitable that CD players will use more batteries then rigid MP3 players.Overall if your in the market for a CD MP3 player buy this, its top of the market, but if your just wanting a portable MP3 player, go look at MP3 players that don't use CD's."
1,WARNING FALSE ADVERTISING!,"My Imp 400 just arrived (I was the owner if the 350 before it broke) and after excitedly unwrapping the package I was shocked to find a pair of clunky generic ""IRiver"" wrap around headphones and NO SENHEISSER EAR BUDS. They practically advertise the ear buds more than the player and now they aren't including them? I feel so ripped off, I know the player is fantastic but I'm wrapping it up and sending it back simply due to the principle of the matter. Don't lie to the customer..."
3,great if u really want an mp3 cd player,"first of all i would like to say this is a great product for anyone completely set on an mp3 cd player. If you are a first time digital audio buyer like i was plaease give a flash or hard drive player much more consideration. I thought this would probably be a better player than most because it could play cds. to get cds you just have to go thru the simple process of ripping. i bought an archos 10 gb mp3 player recorder and am so much more satisfied with it than my iriver. it has the useful feature of recording and more battery life. If you are worried about price or portability then please get a flash based player. you will be much more satisfied, but if you want an mp3 cd player this is the one to go with"
2,Overall i-river quality,"This is a warning about i-riverI do not have this specific i-river product, but I have purchased two of their products in the past, and the quality of both began to deteriorate within months. Both of them damaged numerous sets of headphones, wearing the connectors to the point that only one earpiece would work. On one of my players, the backlight on the LCD stopped working, and on the other the connection between the player and the USB chord no longer holds properly, preventing me from changing any of the MP3's on a 64 MB player. When I contacted the company about these problems they gave me the good ole runaround, basically vouching for the poor qaulity of their products. I will not being buy any of their products again."
5,IRiver does it again,"I have an IMP350 and now a 400 (yes, I admit it, I'm a gadget freak). The 350 was and is outstanding, but my biggest complaint with it was the remote, whose design is counterintuitive at best. IRiver has redesigned the remote for the 400 and now it's nearly perfect, easy to use without needing to check the manual every few minutes. I love both players but I recommend the 400 for the sake of the easy to use remote. The sound is outstanding on both players, and the upgradeable firmware is great. IRiver has really done it right...again..."
4,Technical data displayed is confusing,"I have a question: the technical data list for the iRiver SlimX iMP-400 CD/MP3 Player said that it didn't include the remote control in the box. Is this true? I read a review where was mentioned that without the remote control the CD player was really difficult to use, yet other reviews talk about the remote. Please tell me if the remote control is included with the CD player, and if not tell me if you sell it and at what price. Thanks for your assistance."
3,Review after using Risk Analysis and the Security Survey,"I bought the book to use as a reference while doing my very first risk analysis. It helped me a lot with my project. I found it easy to read and use as a reference. I used the format in the book as a guide when writing up the risk analysis I did.If you haven't done one before and are looking for a good reference guide, this is a great resource."
3,I have to believe it works,"I have no way to prove whether this product works or not but I have faith or I would not have purchased it. The reason I bought it in the first place is because we have a storm drain in our front yard that always has standing water in it. Attempts to get the problem fixed have been futile, so I bought this product so I could pour small amounts into the drain to kill any mosquito larvae that will inevitably be found in there if we have several days without rain."
5,I would buy it again!,"If you like aqua de gio you would truly love this one! Very good odor, will definitely buy it again! Very good price too for so much of it!"
5,Great for every day!!!,"Excellent fragrance for use all day or for work, is smooth and very pleasant, although not recommended for use in evening activities."
3,Smells ok but not like acqua di gio,First time i buy this cologne smells ok. I am not sure how it is supposed to smell but it doesn't smell like acqua di gio by Giorgio Armani which i was hoping for.Will smell it side by side with one from several cologne stores and see how it compares.
4,Real deal,"I was out of town two weeks ago when I visited one of those retail cologne shops. Guy tried to sell me the same product for 35 bucks. This was after he said I'll give you a good deal on it. I then pulled up Amazon on my smartphone right there in the store. I showed the guy where Amazon had it for 17-19 bucks. He started to smirk and said thats knock-off cologne mine is legit. So you can see after you read this review, I bought the product online with Amazon and saved 20 bucks.Long story short, I love the product great smell and my wife purchased the ladies version in a top name department store for 40."
5,Great product at a great price,"This does smell almost identical to acqua di gio, but I gotta say for less than half the price you really can't go wrong. And I like the bottle. I feel as though when you are starting out and getting a cologne collection going it is important to not spend 70 to 80 dollars per bottle. That is a good idea if you truly love one cologne and that is all you will wear."
2,MISLEADING ADVERTISMENT,"What was adverised was the ""perfume"" however what was delivered was the ""Toilette spray"".very misleading"
5,Great fragrence,"This product was what i expected, it smelled great didn't fade away quick. Also I have received many complements on it from females."
5,EXCELENTE PERFUME,"EXCELENTE PERFUME Y EXCELENTE VENDEDOR TODO LLEG;O EN EL TIEMPO PREVISTO Y TAL CUAL COMO ESTABA ACORDADO, MUCHAS GRACIAS VENDEDOR SERIO Y RESPONSABLE"
5,RAMON MUJICA,"MUY BUENO,LO RECOMIENDO,ES UNA BUENA COLONIA,MUY OLOROSA,ESPECIAL PARA CABALLEROS,ASI QUE SE LA RECOMIENDO A TODOS LO CABALLEROS QUE SABEN DE COLONIA."
4,"This book was terrific, a page turner","Dr. Carson is a living example that one can beat the odds regardless of one's socioeconomic status or ethnicity. The adversitities he experienced clearly paved the way for his success as a Neurosurgeon. Furthermore, he would not allow his background to become a hinderance in achieving his goals. Dr. Carson's hard work, experiences and philosophy he relates to in the book are guidelines and incentives for young people especially African American youth who believe that their goals are not attainable. Moreover, students need mentors, and road maps to follow in order to reach their goals.I watch ""Good Morning America"" daily and saw his interview with Charlie Gibson I immediately began looking for the book, and was able to order it.The Carson Foundation is an excellent tool in which all students receive help. After reading ""The Big Picture"" I would recommend it to everyone I know. God Bless and keep you always. Your Sister in Christ. Marietta"
3,"Some Good, Some Not-So-Good","The first two parts of this book were inspiring. Dr. Carson started out by illustrating the ""Big Picture"" with stories from his work. In the second part he went on to talk about the importance of things like parenting, setting goals, etc. I found the last part not at all interesting. In it Dr. Carson talked about his ideas on how to overcome different social issues. This portion was atypical of his normal writing style and I found it neither captivating nor especially thought provoking."
5,amazing man,Ben Carson is a wonderful man. Everything about him is worthy of attention. This book is inspiring as well as informative about a man who is alive and well and living in the USA! You can feel his humble nature through the words written about him as well as the remarkable obstacles he has risen above in his life.
1,broken 3 times..sony wants 700 dolars,sony sucks..i paid this laptop 1700 dolars and it s broken 3 times in a year..first time they fixed and it broken again with same problem but they want 700 dolars for repair...no audio no more playing dvd s ..i m tired of recovery ...stay away from sony...
4,Very Good Laptop,"I purchased this laptop over a year ago and I am still very pleased with it overall. I bought it from Best Buy and paid for the service plan. Since then I had to take it back once for repairs. I highly recommend if you purchase this or any other laptop, you buy some sort of repair plan. Laptop parts are costly.I really like the compact design. I like to travel and have taken this laptop everywhere with little or no problems. It only weighs about 4 lbs so I can move in and out of the airport terminals with no problems. I also like the carbon-fiber case. It is very durable and cannot be scratched. They keyboard size is great. It also comes with a Webcam and microphone which is great for video conferencing. Some other features include a fingerprint scanner, SD memory card reader, and Bluetooth enabled. My favorite feature is the switch that lets you toggle between stamina and speed. The only downside is the cost. It is pricer than many laptops on the market."
5,Easy reading & full of wisdom,"Everything that the artist never thought about... that's why we're artists, not business-people. Good reading and highly recommended."
3,Didn't like the elephants,"Saw one of these in a book store once, and always wanted so I ordered this. Didn't like the elephants (or mastodons) that are featured throughout the book though. Would rather have had the older version"
2,I'm glad I didn't pay much for it.,"Very weak, hardly includes anything in high tech. Panders to the cartoon generation. I expected much more given that I have a very old edition of a similar book and it covers everything from a can opener to a nuke power plant. Disappointing."
4,"Good book, but not for the very young","I bought this book for a boy of the age of 8. He didn't seem very interested in the text explanations of how things work. Perhaps he's a little young, but like other reviewers said, this is a book that can most definately be put on the shelf for several years and still have relevance when a few years of knowledge is gained."
5,Amazing,"Informative and entertaining. I wonder how many engineers out there first got their interest in the way things work from this book.... In Fall 2008 Macaulay will have a new book out entitled ""The Way We Work"", which will explain the workings of the human body in similar fashion to this book. Can't wait!"
5,Absolutely wonderful book!,"My child is engrossed in this book, as I was. I love hearing him (he's seven) explaining how different things in my mom's house work. If you like this, get the game (IPlay The Way Things Work Game) It's fun for the whole family, and very educational."
3,Very in depth,This book is very indepth and detailed. Some of it was hard for my to grasp because I don't think mechanically. But someone who loves putting things together and taking things apart would enjoy this book.
4,Nice binding,"I think this book is nice. I haven't read it because it was a gift for my son, but he loves it. It's a good, sturdy book that will last a long while."
1,a confusing strange book,"I agree with Brian E's 1 star review, he actually said it better in words than I ever could, and summed up EXACTLY what's wrong with this book! The illustrations and explanations are just so muddled, incomplete, and half-finished that you just scratch your head and go ""huh?"" And no I'm not a dummy, I'm a college educated literate reader just like the rest of you. But I'm sorry, this book fails on so many levels. And what is the author's obsession with the wooly mammoth?!?! omg - that is the freaky part....every single page almost this guy draws them interacting with the diagrams and incorporates the mammoth into his examples, writing make-believe stories about how they'd react with each device being explained. It started out as cute, then got creepy really fast."
2,It did not fit my grandson's computer.,This was very disappointing. I got it as a birthday present for my grandson and it did not play in his computer.
5,Husband loves it,My husband loves to learn about how things work. The title of the book told me this was just the book for him.
5,"A ""must have"" for any child.",This is a great book. It breaks down complicated concepts into simple principles that a child can understand. A good start for budding engineers.
5,Great book!,"This is a fabulous book! I like all of David Macaulay's books because they have so many details of how things are made. This is my favorite, though, because it answers questions about objects and technology for budding engineers and architects or just anyone who is curious! My son has loved his and I just bought one for my nephew."
2,Damaged upon receipt.,"The book is absolutely wonderful and I would give it 5-stars. However, my low rating has to do with the condition upon which it was received. The book cover was torn/missing in three places and it was a Christmas gift for my nephew. Because I had no time left to get it replaced, I ended up wrapping it as his gift, but it really looked awful and used. I am really disappointed that it was shipped this way and I know it wasn't damaged during shipment because it was clearly missing pieces of book cover that were not found in the package. I am generally always a happy customer and this is really the first time I have anything to complain about with Amazon."
5,Too good to put down,"This is an excellence book that illustrates masterfully the connection between biblical perfection and righteousness by faith. Dr. Knight points out the often overlooked fact that simply having a carnal nature doesn't makes one a sinner in itself. Dr. Knight also touches on Christ's nature that His temptations were much higher than the ones we face, for ours are weighed by the Father yet Christ who was God in the flesh, faced the full force of Satan's wiles. It is for this reason why Christ did what we're not able to do and it is on His merits and His merits only that we're saved."
5,Can't wait to get to Rome!,"This book will be my BIBLE when traveling to Rome. There are so many good tips and inside information. Having this book will help us plan our trip and make the best of our time and money. Because we're traveling NEXT August, I believe I'll try the 2007 addition too. Thanks Rick Steves!!"
3,Asembly Language,"This book has nothing to do with the Architecture of ARM. It is a detailed assembly language. User's manuals should show and discuss registers that setup the processors. This book has nothing about what makes the processor to function such as UART, SPI ports.."
3,Sturdy toy but wish it were a tad bigger,I am three years old and have trouble putting the clothes on the hangers. The clothes easily fall off. I wish this thing was a little bigger because it doesn't fit all of Dora's clothes and accessories.
3,Good accessory,"This is a durable toy with colors that are appealing to little ones. It is also cute - it comes with petite hangers and a basic dress. It is more work to put the clothes on the hangers and try to cram them in the armoirse than it is worth however. We usually turn the storage bin on it's back, shove the clothes, shoes, etc."
4,Beautiful Groove,"The essence of summer is holding a cool margarita and listening to Koop's 'Summer Sun' as the sun fades. This album is great for lounging as well as dancing. There are a few songs that don't fit, but none are so noticeably bad as to ruin the CDs. The first CD is a little more active while the second is a little more laid-back. Basically, if you enjoy Bossa Nova and don't mind the usual complications with compilations, then get this CD. P.S. the St. Germain song on here is not that great. I suspect it was added to give the compilation a higher profile."
5,Great walking shoe,"This is an outstanding walking shoe. I've worn this shoe on walking tours of the English Cotswolds and will be wearing them in NZ next week on another trek. They offer great support and are waterproof as well. I've even had my old pair repaired to wear about town so that I can save my newer pair for more important walks. Amazon is a good sight to find them, as they're difficult to locate elsewhere, at least in my area."
3,Can you handle the truth?,"As a professional military officer, I found this work interesting and full of great details. I caution readers that are not familiar with the military to understand that this book may be dry or difficult to understand. I am a huge fan of Mr. McDonald and referenced his other work ""Company Commander"" while I was in command of a company myself. Informative, opinionated, and solid are the words I use to describe this book."
5,The Lost Battle,If you want to read a fascinating history of a major defeat of the American Army in World War ll this is it. Most historians write very little of this battle as the Army tried to cover it up and the Battle of the Bulge started during this time. Charles MacDonald does an excellent job in describing the horror that six American divisions endured over a six month period because of ego and poor leadership at the high command level. This book really fueled my interest in this battle and I took a couple of trips through this area as most of it is now a German Nature Park. The reminders of this battle are everywhere and MacDonald's descriptions of the terrain that the soldiers fought is accurate. Of the several books now out about the Huertgen Forest I feel this is the best and most accurate. I loaned my original copy out never to be seen again and ordered another from Amazon for my library.
3,"great sextet, interesting trio, fair sound",The other reviewers here are all agog about the trio on this disc. In fact I bought it for the trio. However speaking as a fan of Brahms I like the sextet better. The Horn trio concept is certainly a relative novelty and there are some fine moments but there is also some tedium in my opinion. The sextet is altogether a finer piece and this is a good version of it. The reason I give it only three stars is the sound. The instruments themselves have good presence but there is a lot of artifactual noise on this recording.
4,Movie Music,Loaned it to my daughter and she still has it. She loves it too. Will probably have to order another.
2,"Aggie Raisin you are not lovable, but I'm addicted","I don't like this woman, nor do I like James. I like the Pastor's wife best of all the characters. Yet I keep reading these. Something about them keeps me coming back."
3,Books you love to hate,"What is it about M.C. Beaton? She writes well. Enough. Her characters are usually annoying. But I grab each title as it becomes available. In Fairies (not) from Fryfam, I loved the ending because I knew Agatha Raisin was finally REALLY going to get hers. Go James. Be the jerk you are! (Probably we don't want to look too carefully under this rock.)"
2,It's a sleeper,"I bought the book thinking it would be more about fairies, but it is just about an old lady who moves into a new town. And chats with other old ladys. VERY BORING They do have a murder but even that is a sleeper."
1,Unbelievably DUMB story`,"This is the first time I have read an MC Beaton book and I am very disappointed. It looked like a good mystery, and as far as the mystery part it was good till you find out that the fairies are just christmas lites some kids ages 4,5,7,8 setup and the kids were the ones who stole stuff from the house. Oh please, kids at that age are going to be smart enough and able enough to setup christmas lites and pull this off. This right here totally turned me off. Don't think I will be reading anymore of the MC Beaton books."
4,Entertaining,I liked this book much better tha last one. It kept me guessing til the end. The ending was surprising and should make for an interesting next installement in the Agatha Raisin series!
4,fairies of Fryfam,"Definitely differant story in the Agatha Raisin series. Strange lights below the garden, missing ceramics from houses. Agatha is surely being kept on her toes!"
4,BOOK REVIEW,YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO THE FAIRIES ARE BUT A GOOD READ. JUST LIKE ALWAYS HER BOOKS ARE GREAT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM ALL.
4,Typical Agatha,"Poor Agatha Raisin has done it again. Her best laid plans, to leave Carsely behind & start anew go awry when the local squire of the quiet town of Fryfam is murdered.A fun, cozy read."
3,"OK, somewhat slow in plot and development.",Disappointing turnout. Disappointing mystery. Well-written but a bit dark and pessimistic outlook on life.
3,A Step Backwards,"If you don't mind punters having the same bodies as lineman, this game is for you. In oder to save space on the game, EA has removed some features to add some others. All the player bodies are now the same, and the stadiums are generic. If this doesn't bother you, then you'll enjoy this game."
3,madden 08 or is it 07,Honestly after playing this game for a while there have been some changes to the game but it is really no different then playing 07. The Glitches and hiccups have not changed. As well as the game play and style of the game. It is really not worth the money. That is why I received my money back.
1,No big difference.,"I didn't find anything special about this game, 2 me it was just another madden game. Not a must have unless u don't own any madden games and u just want 2 play madden. Wasn't impressed."
2,Okay,Not so sure the game was new. Didn't really look like original packaging. Game locks up occasionally and is kinda slow during replays and inbetween plays there is a delay. I know it's not my system. Other than that a great game. I love the new franchise set-up and the superstar mode is pretty cool.
4,one of my favorite maddens,"Game is great it's a mix of madden 2004, 03, & 06 what make this game great is the graphics & the owner mode. SUPERSTAR MODE IS TERRIBLE THOUGH!"
4,drier hair,"this was a great purchase. It does the trick. My hair is considerably drier when I go to blow dry, which cuts down on a lot of time."
5,Aquis Hair Towel,I absolutely love this towel. I don't know how I got along without it. My hair is almost completely dry when I take it off (after about 5 mins) and I spend less time with the blowdryer and therefore my hair is getting healthier and less brittle. Thanks again and I will be ordering more soon...
4,A must for Discworld fans,"""Once More* *with footnotes"" is a collection of short stories, essays, book introductions, etc., by Terry Pratchett. Not all the material by any means is Discworld-related, but some of it is (two of the short stories -- ""The Sea and Little Fishes"" with Granny Weatherwax and ""Troll Bridge"" with Cohen the Barbarian -- fall into the ""must-read"" category for Discworld fans) and everything is fired with the particular Pratchett brand of humor (""Hollywood Chickens"" may not answer fully the age-old question of why the chicken crossed the road, but it certain provides an unusual perspective of ""how"" it crossed)."
3,Cleaning out the attic,"This is a mixed collection of material written by the author. It includes short stories, short essays, and assorted ramblings by the author. It seems to include the good, the fair, and the awful. Based on the Amazon listing, I expected a collection by a number of authors. In the actual book, I do not see them listed. Have I missed something somewhere? This illustrates the problem of ordering something sight unseen. I would not have purchased the book in a brick and mortar bookstore. I gave it three stars based on some content that was higher quality. Averaging out ones and fives gives a three."
5,Great Book; Highly Recommended for Serious Business People,I'm an entrepreneur and engineering exploring management consulting at the moment.I can only think of good things to say.You will at the very least get ideas about improving your business if you read this book. The book is packed with insights.I'd say this book is something to read and keep on the bookshelf for future reference.
4,Great Book,"This is a very good book and complements the whole story line. I was very impressed with the whole series about the mercs. It is a great addition to the whole Valdemar story line and gives a good look into where Kerowyn from the other books gets her moral code. I would recommend this book and The Oathbound to anyone, but the next book Oathblood was a disappointment due to it being a collection of short stories when I was expecting a continuation of this book. Over all you won't go wrong with any of the Valdemar series..."
2,Ouch,"Way to ruin a good set of characters. Oathbound was a fine book. This sequel would have been a lot better if Lacking hadn't thrown in her two favourite cliches. First cliche- two characters fall in love with each other, but spend eight angst-filled chapters weeping because they are sure the other character won't like them. Second cliche- the characters discuss what they would do if a terribly unlikely thing were to occur, and amazingly enough- it happens in the next chapter! And the world is saved because they remembered what they decided they would do! Give me a break."
1,Worst Writer Ever,"I just don't understand the appeal of Mercedes Lackey. She is a terrible writer! Her writing is horrific and painful. She's badly imitates another horrible writer Anne McCaffrey. Come on, there are better fantasy writers out there!"
5,Great book,I bought the book to put on the kindle.I liked the book when it first came out.With it on my kindle i have it to read any where.
5,Very good....,"My husband enjoyed this book very much. When he felt he could find no more Andre Nortons, whose works he preferred over most other SF, he had me order Mercedes Lackey's books, as Ms. Lackey had been one of Norton's collaborators. His last days were spent reading them. He died 2 months ago. I will package these up and give them to the local Veterans' hospital for others to enjoy."
3,How do I get this on DVD? ron rivchin jessica simpson megan fox,I can't find this film anywhere. Does anybody know where to get a DVD copy? I like the carribean backdrop and Walken is amazing.
2,Not good compatibility with many DVD Drives. No compatibility with Mac.,Very little compatibility with Windows and no compatibility with Apple computers. The -RAM disc format are dying. Better to use a DVD-/+RW disc.
2,"misleading, but interesting","The first half of the book is written by Seamus MacNeil, who passed away a few years ago, and was very much responsible for spreading knowledge of the Highland Bagpipe around the world. Unfortunately, much of that knowledge is less than accurate. The second half of the book is much more entertaining. It is written General Richardson, who studied with John MacDonald of Inverness. Richardson has also passed on, sadly. But he is a great story teller, and even though he is not as technically minded as MacNeil I found his half of the book most useful because he manages to get his love of the music across without puffing himself up in the process."
5,All you need to know is there,"The reading took me one year. It was a good year. I found the answer to so many questions I had for decades. It gave me a new look to my beloved Church. I understood on a new profound way so many gestures, so many words, so many symbols... It's an incredible journey into a symbolic world. I loved it!"
5,"Esoteric Christian Hermeticism, by Valentin Tomberg","This book is an excellent contemplative discussion of Christian Hermeticism, published anonymously and posthumously. The author is the great Russian esoterecist, Valentin Tomberg. A superb meditative guide and a wonderful aid for contemplative prayer!"
5,Meditations on the Tarot,"A wonderfully scholarly tome, one that provides hours of reverie and insight into the the spiritual nature of the the Tarot. It is recommended as a vital additions to one's Tarot library."
5,A Spiritual Anchor,"This book is a spiritual anchor for those who have been traveling in rough seas of searching for the Truth. If you spent years meditating, going to church and ashrams, attending sat-sangs and empowerment seminars, paid for sessions with gurus and healers of all stripes, read voraciously on self-help, healing, occultism, philosophy and psychology, and STILL you haven't settled in the depth of your heart and mind, this book will do that for you. You will be reading it for years, and you will find the warmth, wisdom, love and acceptance that eluded you. The book is hard to read, it is dense with meaning and references to Christian Hemeticism you may never heard of, but if you are patient, it will stretch your heart and mind and make it more beautiful, just the way exercise does for the body."
3,Where was the Editor?,"I really want to write a positive review of this book. The author is a genius. His insights are profound and deep. His knowledge is wide ranging. His intentions are very genuine. But his thoughts ramble like a sand mandala maker on LSD.He takes a particular topic and goes off in 10 different directions. I've read this book, put it down, picked it up and read it again, tried different chapters to see if it was better in certain areas, etc.However, the same question pops up for me. Did the author have an editor? Did the editor ever say: your thoughts need taming, they need structure? Did the editor ever let the author know that he needs to start with a particular point, develop it and then come to some conclusion before starting with another thought.For those of you who enjoy dense and complicated language, this book will work for you. However, if clarity of language is something you require, think twice before buying this book."
5,Not for the faint of heart,"Do NOT be put off by the title, thinking this is some New Age book about how to do tarot readings. Nothing could be farther from the truth. This is a major work of scholarship--not for the faint of heart. It is heavy going, extremely deep and erudite. The author (and there is speculation as to who this is) plumbs many sources, which he/she knows well--the bible, kabbalistic tradition, esoteric religions, Nietzsche, Freud, Christian mystics (Bonaventura, Francis of Assisi, to name but two), and the Tao Te Ching. This is work rich in symbol-making and he/she has the scholarly erudition to illuminate the nuances held in the cards.At 650 pages, this is a tome to approached with reverence and seriousness. To 'read' it is to study it, slowly, contemplatively. It will change your thinking about many things."
4,Aside from a few things...,"...This is a great set.I loved this show when I saw it on CBS in 1995(as a rerun); it might be their best season. One of my favorite Garfield episodes of all time, Top Ten, is on here(Top 10 reasons Jon's dates don't last long will have you on the floor), as well as a favorite US Acres toon, with the twisted fairy tales.The only things I didn't like are how they changed ""US Acres"" to ""Orson's Farm"", and how they didn't use the actual season 7 opening which I was hoping to get(apparently I was supposed to hate it according to some guy on youtube). Either it was because such a fanbase hated it so much the company went with the usual syndicated opening, or they couldn't get the rights from whoever sang it or whatever.Please don't let that stop you from getting this, the cartoons are just as good as they've always been."
5,One Fat Cat,"A must for all the Garfield lovers, both and new. Who can resist Garfield? One of the best cartoons of all time."
2,Expected Better From Fox,"Don't buy this unless you're a hardcore Garfield cartoon series fan. Twentieth Century Fox did a sloppy job on this one. The first disc has a bunch of advertisements in the beginning of it. The color quality is less than professional you'll notice some bleeding here and there. For some reason, they changed the name of the ""U.S. Acres"" cartoon segament in the series to ""Orson's Farm"" on each of the episodes but did not update the same names in the episode indexes. The ""Special Features"" are simply trailers for the movies ""Like Mike 2"" and ""Dr. Dolittle 3"". It would have been nice if they included in interview with Garfield's creator Jim Davis or some of those who did the voices of the characters. They could have included a pitch reel or other background stuff but they did not. At $39.95 for a 3 disc set this was a real let down."
2,Look Around First,"This short paperback book is way, way, way overpriced. The information in the book can be researched online for free, although it is nice to have it in one neat little file. It has a collection of beautiful photos of Tonkinese cats, which to me is a big plus. But the bottom line is that at this price I expected a longer more detailed book, particularly since it is just a paperback. You can read this in it's entirety in one sitting."
2,"Pretty to look at, but not a great read","The design of the periodical is lovely, reader friendly and really promotes a sense of who the authors are. But I have long found Glimmer Train stories disappointing. Too many of them feel ""writerly,"" as if the writers, and editors, know that they are writing a SHORT STORY. The writing is too self-aware, and many of the stories ring false, with contrived endings and plots, when they exist. I have to admit that I like a limited number of short stories, works by James Joyce and Alice Munro. These don't even come close to those master works."
1,Horrible. The worst.,"This book is horrendous. A class I took required it. I hope I never have to review another book from HBS or these authors. This book belongs in the garbage, not taking up space on a bookshelf. There could not possibly be a more poorly written textbook on the topic."
1,Corporate Information Strategy and Management: Text and Cases,This was required in my MBA class and it is one of the worst books I have ever read. This book is so dull and lifeless it should be removed from all academic institutions.
2,Wrong Edition,"I was very unhappy with my purchase. After I wrote in the book, I realized that I had not ordered the most recent version. I looked back at the way the book was presented on Amazon, and the 7th version was displayed predominately. However, if you scrolled down, there was a small message that a more recent version of the book was available. Neither description clearly identifed which edition of the book you were purchasing. The newer 8th edition is very different than the 7th. I'm getting by in class, but I think the way this was presented was very deceptive. I'm going back to buying at the school bookstore."
2,Approximately 7 of 10 chapter induce eye gouging.....,"This book only gets 2 stars from me because 3 or so chapters are actaully worthy of reading. The remainder compells the reader to gouge out their own eyeballs to avoid reading another sentence of the poorly written chapters. You'd think with having 3 authors they could do better than this but alas...no. Most likely you don't have a choice of whether or not to read this book however I am a better man for not having to read this book again. I'll be getting my MBA in 8 days and look forward to NOT reading books like this for the rest of my natural life. Best of luck, you'll need it."
4,Corporate Informatio strategy and Management: Text and Casses,"Very good case analysis for the non IT professional. Very good examples, utilizing thoughtful cases to provide a solid understanding of the Information Technology infusion into the business world. Very good text for the IT professional to understand the full context of the IT world into the basic business situation. Short cases are interesting and thought provoking when studied and analyzed in a classroom or personal situation."
1,Badly written and edited,"Horribly written. No real point to many of the chapters except meandering buzzwords linked to other buzzwords. If there is a point to be found in this book, it needs a serious editor. The graphs and exhibits are often not lableled, which can be a real problem if you're trying to use the data to write up a case."
2,Below Average Book,"I bought this book for $150 at the local bookstore - using brand new this semester. What do you get for that price? Cases that are not up to date (many end around 2000-2001), terrible topic headings within the chapters, cheap looking diagrams using company names that are blurry and ineffective, and another worthless book that isn't being bought back on your bookshelf. And I haven't even started with the writing... They will give you a subject heading or topic that will be discussed without even explaining it very well AT ALL! Many times a topic will be given, they give a mediocre company example and you don't understand the concept clearly. My anger with the buyback policy and the ridiculousness of this class may be swaying my opinion, but I still say this book is toward the lower echelon of books I have had in the past."
5,Totally groovy,"Really, what do you want to listen to? Great rock tunes, vocals and verve that gets your blood flowing. Can't beat these guys. LA and Cold in the Country are instant classics--and no, I don't know anyone in the band. Great to sing along to in the car--first up on my Car Mix!"
5,TRUSTWORTHY,trust me go out and buy this cd because it is a siccmade product and it is dope go and buy all related siccmade muzicc artists and big bread artists cds take my advice if you like brotha lynch hung you will love these products.
4,nice album crappy production,"Zagg is such a creative mc and one of the best female mcs ever.Her verse on locc to da brain was legendary.This is a smooth album and very entertaining.I would have easily givin this five stars if the production was better,I have no idea why the production was so terrible but even with that it is still a great album."
4,White to play and Win,"If you start with 1 d4 then this book has plenty of ideas to help you to win. The backbone of the openings that Lane wants everyone to play is the London System. This has never struck me as being particularly aggressive but it is perfect to make sure that White enters the middlegame with no fear of falling into a trap. The London System is no good against every opening and the author is honest enough to admit this rather than give a game which just happens to demolish the Dutch or something! I have found that how to deal with the side-lines such as the Clarendon Court are very useful. In the main lines the easy to follow guide in the Benoni and the Dutch are well worth a look.Basically, I have improved my openings as a result of this book and that really is the true test."
2,The Modern Chess Openings? Please...,"This is a repertoire book with something against most of the things you might meet after 1.d4. The lines are superficially explained and analysed, and do not often give white chances of an opening advantage. There are some useful lines here, but you can find better repertoire books anywhere easily.The title is stolen from Fine's ""Ideas behind the Chess Openings"", and it is a ploy from the publisher to get more sales. The London system, which this book is based on, is not a modern opening, so the title could not be more misleading. I am sure the author had nothing to do with naming the book."
1,The inhuman workplace,"This book should be titled ""Chicken Soup For The Displaced Worker."" With one exception: You get more depressed after you read it. If anyone hands you this book, tell them no thanks. I strongly agree with the reviewers who said that this is a book for clueless managers looking to jump on meaningless trends."
3,A Motivational Appetizer,"If you are hungry, get another menu because this is not an entree. It will whet your appetite and give you words to ponder and get you thinking! It is fun to read, pithy, and motivational!"
3,"""It's Simply the Truth.""","While I personally would not endorse anyone to remain an employee, it's a fact that there are 4 types of people in the world of work - Employees, Self-Employed, Business Owners and Investors. Some people seem to choose to remain Employees, so this book will probably help them to be good at that.As for the rest of us, well, we know what to do."
1,Only because 0 stars isn't an option,"This book had to have been written knowing that managers control purchase of such books, so lets tell them everything they want to hear and make some money. Aside from stating obvious advice such as stay flexible, keep your skills up to date, do a good job and other topics that fall under the rubric of ""DUH!"", this sparsely worded pocketbook proceeds to absolve managment of their duties by shifting them to the employees they manage. In between randomly quoted computer industry statistics that serve no purpose whatsoever other than filler amongst pages starving for content, Price places all responsibility on the worker bees, leaving the managers free to kick back and read more stupid books like this one. Amongst his pearls of wisdom doled out to the troops are ""Work like you own the company"" and ""You are responsible for your own motivation"". Need I say more?"
1,A good example of a book that should be burned&#65533;.,"Let's cut to the chase. The message of this book is quite simple:Change your current attitude and increase your productivity so that you will ad value to your company in the long run. In other words, all for the benefit of us (managers, CEOs, Bill Gates, etc.) at the expense of you, the employee (the tried and true `profits over people' mentality rears its ugly head once again in corporate America). If the events of September 11 or the recent Enron affair haven't yet taught us that money and misguided ""motivation"" should NOT be the primary goals in life, I don't know what will."
1,This is a bad book,"My company unfortunately distributed this book. This guy who wrote this book is an idiot. If you're a manager or above in an organization and want to run your people into the ground and make a name for yourself, then this book is for you. His message is quite disturbing and detrimental to how business should be run. I'm not against free speech, but if I was, I'd start with this book."
5,Loved the Costume,i bought this costume for my nephew...he is 7 years old and pretty husky..i decided on the large since he is so husky...it did not close all the way but that did not matter since his cape will cover it up...he looks so cute and doesn't look husky at all since the costume comes with built in muscles which he loved
2,Carafe spills all over when pouring,The carafe spills when pouring no matter how much is in it. I've tried pouring slower almost to a trickle to no avail. Very disappointing.
1,piece of crap,"I would like to second the other reviewer's comments about weak coffee by adding that if I tried to make more than eight cups with mine, the water would overflow the container holding the coffee grounds, spilling them into the coffee itself and blocking the dispenser. Result: 6 cups of ground-filled weak coffee. I wish I hadn't lost my receipt. I'd be embarrassed to manufacture a product like this."
5,Highly recommended,"I knew my 8-year-old audience liked this book when she asked me to continue reading after the second episode . . . I knew we had a real gem when, after we read it from cover to cover, she flipped to her favorite parts and read them again.What's more, I can't say I've ever enjoyed a comic more. The story of Amelia's dad backing out of plans for her party had me weeping; the Christmas story of Amelia learning to be (heroically) generous stirred even my jaded Christmas-hating heart; and Aunt Tanner's rock song quotes had me singing Elvis Costello and Dylan --and gave me the perfect excuse to educate the next generation on REAL music. But I digress.The kids are sharp-tongued (well, except for Pajamaman --he doesn't talk) and vibrant, the adults are flawed humans, the stories are moving, and the cartooning is as charming as the best of Peanuts. What more could you ask for? The book will provide you and the kids hours of treasured memories."
5,A series that will engage the reluctant reader,"My son (almost 7) absolutely loves this book. The stories are amusing, deal w/ common societal occurrences (a friend w/ no money, a dad who skips his visit, etc.), and generally contain a positive message. My son read this book for nearly 1 1/2 hours his 1st time picking it up. That's a winner to me! Another great, funny comic w/ more recognizable characters is DC's Tiny Titans."
1,digilife c330/340,Bought one to give as a gift. Got it; checked it out - it worked. Some time later I gave it as a gift. Did not work. There was no information in the box whatsoever. I went to the website. Still no info as to where to get it serviced or warranty info. Buyer beware !!!! Junk
4,fantastic storytelling. no holds barred,"written in a way that you can clearly tell and sense his ""voice"" as if you were right there with him along the way. his offhanded mention of discovering John Wayne is one of many priceless stories. appreciated his honest candor throughout and it's also unique to see the hollywood of the 30s/40s/etc thru one actor's (and then director's) eyes...someone who had quite a long successful run."
1,disappointing,This tea tastes a bit odd and lacks any sort of distinct ginseng taste. We found it bland even after steeping it long past the recommended time. This is definately not a good tea and I would not recommend it.
5,"Great Book, not very happy with arrival condition","This is a cute story for any child that is about to expect their first brother or sister. Our son loves it (27 months) right now he is more interested in the animals, but he will slowly progress into understanding the story ESPECIALLY when the baby arrives.The book content itself is wonderful, I will say when it arrived I was disappointed in the sellers condition of the book. The corners were all dented, there was a random price tag sticker, and the book looked like it had been rubbed against other books because the sheen on the cover was very dull. Overall, love the book, but I will NEVER buy from this seller again."
5,A hit!,"Powers Boothe is perfectly cast as a petty officer who sells out his country for a buck. He is one mean son-of-a-gun, as in TOMBSTONE and DEADWOOD. I loved it on television and even more, uninterrupted, on this VHS tape. I would say, go for it!"
4,It is good fiction history,"I didn't know this story, unlike Breach...and it is along the same lines of people that manage to fly under the radar and are traitors to their country. Do not seem to understand they lose in the end and whatever the momentary rewards not worth the deception."
1,Returning of items due to wrong region code,"Returned because it was coded for US ( region 1 ) and I could not play it here in Spain ( region 2 )The Kray Brothers was ok, but it came from another source."
3,"Great product, but be wary of less than robust cable/audio-jack","I just received the product, i love the sound. But the audio jack fell off (or rather, stayed stuck in my ipod and the cable snapped off) on day two. I wouldn't necessarily use this as a deciding criterion, but do be aware."
5,Better than my $6k home setup,"I was not going to get it since I bought the Shure E4 recently. After some thoughts I bought it on Amazon and it was an unbelievable sounding headphone. Too bad I could not demo it anywhere or I could have gotten it a long time ago. The next task is to convert everything to over 200Kbps since 128Kbps decoding does not cut it. I could tell it's more muddy at 128Kps. Life is too short, go spend your hard earn money on this and remember to thank me later. what does it sounds like? Go demo a $20k speaker/amp setup at your hifi dealer. This earphone sounds similar to that."
3,Product is great -Ultimate Ears Customer Support Non-Exsistent,"Recently attempted to obtain custom ear pieces for the UE Triple.Fi 10 that I purchased in November. Local audiologist informed me that Westone, their supplier of custom ear pieces had a falling out with Ultimate Ears and would not manufacture custom pieces for Ultimate Ears sets. Called and left 3 messages over 10 days with Ultimate Ears Customer Service to discuss how to obtain custom ear pieces for their product. I could not get the basic courtesy of a return phone call. I now have a Shure SE530 on order as Westone (and the local audiologist) is happy to work with Shure (and most everyone else)."
2,Faulty,Mine were faulty. Left side volume was significantly lower than right side. Fitting is a problem too.Amazon promptly refunded.
2,If Only They Had Fit...,"I ordered these Triple.fis, and loved them, but had to return them.They sound fantastic. Crisp highs, solid mids but not too prominent, full tight bass with no boom. Very spacious and rich. So why the return?I couldn't get the darn things to fit. I don't consider myself as having small ear canals, but the exit ports of these are FAT (large diameter)! I tried all the tips, followed the directions, and studied the video on the UE website, but couldn't get them to stay sealed in my canals--they would start out okay but gradually work their way out.As soon as they lose their seal--there goes the bass. I know the reach-over-your-head-and-pull-your-ear-back thing, and that didn't work either.I have a pair of Etymotic ER-4Ss (not nearly as nice) and have had no trouble with the fit. Of course the exit ports on these are MUCH smaller in diameter (about half the size).Sad, as I loved the sound of the UEs. If you can get these to seal, and stay that way, you'll be VERY pleased."
2,Good but aggravating.,"For all that has been done for the sound quality of these ear buds, they only sound good if they stay firmly in place. I've tried all sizes of the included pads but the ear buds keep working loose. When they work loose the bass drops out and the sound becomes thin. For that reason I can only use then when sitting still. I was hoping to use then while jogging or cycling but have gone back to using my cheap Koss while exercising.By all means, if you do well wearing ear buds these are the best. If you have trouble with ear buds then spending this much money on a pair may be frustrating. Make sure your ears are compatible with ear buds before you spend this much money."
2,"Sound Great, Too Big","I found these to be great on sound, but too large to enjoy. They also fall out frequently. I returned them and went for a Weston UM2 model."
3,They sound good but the Shure 530 buries them!,"I own these and the Shure 530's...The UE's, the sound is rather thin, lacking body in low to mids., with the high freq glare with heavy roll-off accruing at 16khz. The bass is extended nicely, but still lacks the body and weight.With the Shure 530's, lots of body, extended low freq, and the Highs are so much coherent, and well extended. Plus when using them with my Nokia N95 cell phone, they play a bit more louder than the UE's, at a level I much more prefer.IMO, For the extra $$ to get the 530's it is well worth it.As the UE just sit in my draw, not used."
5,Pretty Pleased,"Instead of Eudora Welty's ""Why I live at the P.O.,"" it could very well be Alison Clement's ""Why I'm Leaving Palmyra."" In a running first person dialogue, Palmyra resident, Lucy Fooshee, describes small town life from a very subjective point of view. While Lucy tells the story, her own blatant character flaws are humorously exposed.As a result, we seem to enjoy loving or hating the vain, self-absorbed Lucy. Our strong reactions indicate that the main character has enough depth to actively engage the reader. By the end of the book, defenders of Lucy Fooshee are pleased to discover there are hints of her maturity on the horizon. Who knows? Perhaps someday Fooshee fans will find out if there's life for Lucy AFTER Palmyra."
5,A sweet masterpiece,"Wow, where has this woman been hiding? What a brillaint new author. This is the start of a great career, I hope, because I want more books like this one."
4,Not the best I've ever read,"""Pretty is...."" was pretty decent. I picked it up simply because the girl was from ""Palmyra."" I can honestly say...some of those people in the book really got on my nerves. But.....Lucy reaped what she sowed and they all went down because of it."
2,I was a little disappointed after I washed it,"After washing the shirt for the first time, cracks began to appear in the screen-printing. More cracks have appeared quickly with future washings."
2,Fuel belt,I purchased this so that my bibs would no longer need to be pinned yo my shirt. It worked ok but it tides upward. Will likely not use this again. Trial n error.
5,Basic & Gets the Job Done,"Nothing too fancy here. Just a quality product and a must have for racers. No more struggling to pin your number on your shirt, then realizing its crooked/too loose/too tight/ now ripped. No holes in your shirts. Gel storage on the sides is nice for long runs or races. It have some reflective parts but they are mostly covered up for me so it won't really help you there."
2,not happy,"Lets see, where to start???It rides up.It shifts like crazy.I'm just not happy with this product at all. I wore it during my first full marathon and it was such a pain in my you know what. I had to constantly adjust it so that the camera man could catch my bib #. It shifted up and over to my back more times than I care to count. The ONLY thing I liked about it was that I could easily put my jacket on and off and make sure my bib was showing. Other than that, these belts are worthless!"
1,OK until warranty ran out,Great screen; good size. Now I have stripes on the monitor & keys that do not work. Can get no help from Sony. Cannot recommend this.
1,disappointed,"i bought this notebook for my sister as wedding gift. however, it has not worked normally now. it works slowly; it can not be turned off as my other notebook, sometimes it had to be forced to turn off. And there is problems about the screen. it always turns to black no matter how you adjust the screen light, even restart.i do not recommend this notebook."
1,Problems with Monitor,"I've had Sony Vaio desktop computers in my house since 1999. I bought this one in September 2006 and just six months later the monitor went bad. It was an excellent computer for the six months I had it. (that was in May 2007) Update from September 2007: Sony fixed the previous problem...the inverter was bad, but now the battery doesn't work and there's a yellow vertical line down the right side of the screen. Fortunately I have 2 weeks remaining on the warranty. Normally Sony is an excellent computer; I think I got a bad system...it's forcing me to purchase the extended warrany plan (approximately $400)."
1,I hate SONY notebook,"I hate SONY Notebooks. I bought this SONY Notebook and had problem with scroll pad as well as problem with FAN. FAN makes lot of noise, as if we are running a turbine.FAN replacement is very costly. You can not tolerate the noise either. Only choice left is through away SONY NotebookIf you are planning to use this at work place every one will stop by say ""Can you shutdown your SONY?"" Fan Noise is very annoying."
2,Will not read this author again,"I usually read a book each week. This book took me almost 3 weeks to get through because it was boring. I almost gave up and didn't finish it. I was glad to get this book over with so that I could read something good again. I didn't really care about any of the characters, the plot took forever, it was just pages and pages of nothing really happening.I sure wouldn't call this a medical thriller, there were NO thrills here,just a lot of nothing going on."
5,Lie still makes one think hard about life,"David Farris has written one of the the best medical thrillers ever! The relativity to today's ethical and moral dilemmas in medical practice makes one ache for all physicians. Farris forcefully defends a doctor's responsibilities to patients first, and touches on most contemporary arguments dealing with questions of life. We are led to think - this is the highest praise for any author, and Farris accomplishes this in beautifully constructed prose which marks him as a writer first and foremost. But, I'd be proud to have him as my doctor."
2,Disappointing,"The protagonist wasn't very likeable; the plot extremely unbelievable, and the graphic sex overdone. I did enjoy the medical parts...someone in an earlier review refrerred to the Vital Signs column in Discover & this part of the book was fascinating. Don't bother buying it; check out at the library/"
1,Disappointed,"The book had to much repetiveness, congecture,and assumptions. As far as I am concernered the book is fiction predicated on variouys sources of information. It appeared to me nothing is the book has been substatiated or could be substantiated."
4,Looks more pink than purple in person,"In the image provided, it looks very purple which is what I wanted. When it arrived, I thought they made a mistake and sent a pink one since it was clearly a pink case. When I put it onto my phone, the dark grey of the phone toned down the pink and created more of the desired purple aesthetic. The edges still look a bit more pink than I want but it's not too bad."
4,Funny Funny Funny,"Shaun is the best. Very funny, very well done. Oh, I have to say twenty more words, OK, so twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen, fifteen, fourteen, .... that's probably enough."
3,Abridged. Some scenes missing,"Great series, but this particular compilation appears to be abridged, with each episode missing about a minute from it's original 7 minute length. Try renting from an online DVD rental to see the full versions. It's worth it for those who love the series."
4,Shaun the Sheep Shorn of the Fine Theme Song...,"I loved ALL of the episodes, *but* they begin without the introductory theme music. If you are a purist and want to relive each episode as it was originally broadcast on TV, then you will be disappointed that the intro has been removed as well as the ending credits and music. The ending credits DO run on the last episode, ""Mountains out of Molehills,"" but that's all. I found it disconcerting that the episodes ended awkwardly with what looked like a last pose (fade to black...) instead of going to the theme song and credits. Just my $1.98."
5,Perfect!,It was better than the part I bought from the dealership that only lasted literally 2 months that I paid 5 times as much for.
2,Sometimes they are rarities for a reason,"Lately I've started to look for early funk recordings that I had never heard of. Cold Heat seemed like a great collection.On first listen though, this wasn't as groovin' as I had hoped for. It could be that the lo-budget production quality of the tracks got in the way or maybe the material itself was off. It's useful to hear the influences of the day. Psychedelic rock meets soul blues and early funk. And I did like that it was mostly instrumental. It seems like this stuff was best experienced live, and didn't translate that well in the studio."
3,Too cold - and a bit overrated,"I`ve been looking forward to gettin` my hands on this compilation for a looong time. I`m a huge fan of James Brown and Fela,and hoped for some real nasty funk, but even though the tail on this alligator is moving a lot, the musicians just doesn`tlock in on the groove. I think they are a little too eager to please, and their butter ain`t hot enough to melt the cheese!I think ""Go for your self"" by Kenny Smith & The Loveliters is the standout track here. Fantastic! Man, I like those rollingdrums! 3 stars is maybe a bit harsh, you will find some funky drummers and tight bassplayers here, but compared to first ratecompilations like ""New Orleans Funk"", ""African Scream Contest"", ""King Funk"", ""Texas Funk"" and the box set ""What it is"" thisjust doesn`t measure up. The sound quality is also rather poor on some cuts."
1,"If there is zero star ranking, I would have given it","Pro:1. Small foot print2. Can print 2 up, 4 up, etc.3. Low price point.Con:1. Not as sharp as the HP, NEC, Okidata even with the 600x600 resolution.2. Longer warm up time compare to other printers3. Poor quality.I got this printer on 11/11/2002 and the laser unit broke on 12/25/02. The local Authorized repair center no longer takes care of Samsung products and I have to ship it to get it repaired. Samsung refused to replace this printer for free.I have used (and still using some of them) the HP, Brother, NEC, and Okidata laser printers, this printer is absolutely the worst.My advice to the potential buyer is to find out if there is a local service center before you purchase it on-line. The other alternative is to buy extended warranty from a local store (which negates the low price point).So, consider your total cost for ownership before you jump in because the low initial purchase price."
3,"Good value, but a few caveats.","The price on this printer cannot be beat. Easy to install, dependable (even for a top feeder -I've had no paper jams yet), and has a very small footprint. The printer's toner saver feature works well, achieving surprisingly good text quality when activated.Downsides: Very slow to spool and utilizes PC's resources while spooling much more than my HP 1000 LaserJet, which contains only 1MB of ram. The HP goes from spool to printed document in no time flat. This printer takes much too long to warm up to prepare for printing. Once warmed up and printing, the printer performs well.Also, be careful of Samsung's rebate policy. I purchased two items on the same invoice; the rebate for the Samsung required the ORIGINAL invoice to obtain the rebate, I sent a copy. Long to short: no rebate for me!If you are looking for laser economy at an economical price, this printer is hard to beat. For another $100, however, you can do yourself a favor and find a much better laser printer."
2,Paper feed problems,"I had this printer for about 3 years. I have the same paper feed issues as others here. Actually, the printer won't feed paper at all, so it has become useless. During the 3 years I've owned it, I have hardly even used the printer, evidenced by the fact I've not had to change the toner yet.Secondly, the 600x600 dpi sucks when compared against the printer quality of the copies I've made at Kinkos. No comparison. And I'm talking about text, not graphics.I thought my print feed error was an isolated problem, but I see many others here have the same problem so I will not be purchasing a Samsung any time soon, although I see that the models since the 1430 have changed the feeder style."
1,Same problem with the paper not feeding,"I have the same problem as Detson with the paper not feeding, and though I've owned the printer for about 2 years, I've only used it to the point where I've just finished the starting toner cartridge. I lived the problem for several months, sometimes if I lift the paper out of the tray and put it back in the paper will feed properly, but only for a few pages. Kind of disappointed, though to be fair my brother recommended this printer to me and he's had no problems with it."
2,Repair Problems,"I purchased the ML-1430 in June and it worked great for a few weeks. All of a sudden it started to emit a loud noise from the motor and quit working a few days later. The repairs were covered by warranty and the motor had to be replaced. The technician also said the toner cartridge was ceased which may have caused the motor to fail. Unfortunately, the toner is NOT covered by warranty & I was charge $99 for a new one.I don't know if my case was unusual but if you have any similar symptoms, return immediately since you don't want the motor to fail after the warranty period!"
2,"Cheap, but mediocre quality","This is one of the cheapest laser printers in the market. However, papaer jams happen all the time and the margins of the printouts are not aligned (my printer is only 1-month old). In retrospect, I should have paid more for a better printer."
2,unhappy camper,"AT first, I was pretty happy with this printer, but it stopped working less than a year after I purchased it. Another thing I didn't like was the cost of the printer cartridges...nearly $80. Moreover, the cartridges don't last very long, even with the toner saver. In all, I was pretty unhappy with Samsung printers. Even though Samsung replaced the printer with a new similar model, I'm not expecting my replacement to last or perform for very long."
3,Best BANG for teh Buck.,"This was an excellent deal and the quality and speed of the printed page was great. Only problem was the paper loaded switch broke 2 weeks after I got it, meaning it wouldn't print until fixted. That's why I only gave it a 3 star. If it did not brake, I would have givened it a 5 star."
5,Samsung ML-1430 Laser Printer,"I bought this printer for my office at home. I was tired of the cost of Ink Jet cartridges and how quickly the printers wore out. I bring alot of work home and adding in the kids and my husband, printing was expensive. I love this printer. I have owned it over 2 years with absolutely no problems. It was inexpensive to buy and the cartridges are inexpensive to replace. The quality of the print is great. It was easy to set up. I save the inkjet for pictures only."
1,Everything you have heard is true,"I received this printer about three years ago as a gift, and at first it performed pretty well. I could live with the long warm-up periods, as it was still faster than my old inkjet. After about a year of occasional use, however, I was forced to replace the toner cartridge. Since then almost every sheet jams or refuses to load. If something was damaged when I replaced the cartridge, it was through no fault of mine; I followed the instructions to the letter. Now I've got a malfunctioning printer with a 2.5' mass of sticker-glue permanently affixed to the front. Joy."
5,Can't believe it was this good,"I got as good quality out of this printer that I've gotten out of my HPs at work. And at home I got tired of using inkjets and being afraid a cold drink would drip upon the printouts and run.For the price you don't get features like paper trays, this printer instead uses an angular feeder, but who needs them anyway?"
4,Nice Book,"Good book for backyard birders - there are a few birds missing, or they don't get the space they deserve (a pic in the back of the book, maybe) - otherwise short and sweet, not for folks who want to know everything about the bird, and I didn't expect more anyway...I would add other books for complete information. I like the real photographs of the birds, but I also have other books in which the birds are painted and give more detail. All in all a good addition, but information-wise this book would not be able to stand alone for someone who asks for more."
5,Great guide,"I really like this bird guide. I bought it after growing out of a woefully incomplete guide for Connecticut. This book is very complete and includes a section in the back with rare migrants (in case you are extremely lucky). The pictures are nice and the blurbs are useful and interesting. The one thing that could be better is that they sometimes include little sketches of what juvenile coloring, color morphs and breeding coloring looks like (very nice thing to include) but they really aren't as clear/helpful as a photo. The book goes about its task in an organized and scientific manner which I appreciate. The birds are organized by taxonomy and once you get a general feel for it you can flip to the relevant sections very quickly. I definitely recommenced this book to anyone who is even a little serious about New England birds. Those looking for a bird-feeder bird guide may find this book too comprehensive and may be happier with something simpler."
2,No one bats 1000,"I'm a big fan of Berger, but Sneaky People disappointed me. The thesis, in a nutshell: never shoot anything before thinking it through. You will ask if I oversimplify, but for this book I think not. The redeaming qualities are in how the tales are told. It was fun to peek at pre-WWII America: memories of stuff my parents' aunts and uncles told me enlivened the narrative. A younger reader will not have that. I was propelled to the finish by little more than the excellent wordsmithing. In general, I really like Berger. His 'Arthur Rex' is one of my very favorites, for lots of reasons. But 'Sneaky People' did not make me stay up past bedtime nor be late for work. Civilization will not fall if you give this a pass."
4,"Good, but more concise than comprehensive.","This is good book, with worthwhile ideas about starting, re-working, growing, arranging and finishing a thesis to be proud of for a long time. The best parts deal with understanding the overall structure of the thesis, and the relationship between the words and the work over time. But then there are seemingly superficial parts that any graduate student would know (use a spell checker) or that are dated (floppy disc, zip disc).Glad I read this consise book. But really glad I read it at the library and so saved my money for more comprehensive tomes about surviving and thriving grad school."
3,"Not the easiest read, not indepth","I bought this book hoping to learn what a $2 million producer did differently than a $500,000 producer. Hearing their stories does provide inspiration but their is no depth of knowledge to glean from this book."
2,stock brokers still have no credibilty,"The brokers who produce the most in commissions, by CHARGING THE HIGHEST RATES, are considered to be the most successful.What are their customers returns? Are there any returns?For all of the changes in the financial industry, the one tenet that remains is the importance of separating the customer from his money, and that is what this book is all about."
2,"It LOOKS good, but . . .","the levers are really only for lifting up the hollow, weightless plastics ""rocks"" that come with it. If you want to do any REAL digging (and who doesn't?), you have to go manual. A huge disappointment for my poor 3 yo who had visions of completely digging up my garden.It's all plastic, and I'll be interested to see how long it really lasts. It would be okay if it was just going to be an inside toy, but what's the point of having construction equipment if you can't play with it in the dirt?And the noise. It's REALLY loud. My advice is to spend your money on something sturdier that doesn't have all the lights and sounds and mechanical actions."
5,"The best ""My Name Is America.""","""The Journal of Douglas Allen Deeds : The Donner Party Expedition, 1846"" is the best ""My Name Is America"" book that I have read so far. Giving just the right amount of details, Philbrick was able to show the horrors the emigrants suffered, while trying to make a new life in California. I read this book after ""Against All Odds: The Lucy Scott Mitchum Story"" which always referred to what happened to The Donner Party. Having not knowing what happened exactly, this book helped me understand why they were so scared. The historical note at the end was very, very interesting, but not for readers with weak stomachs (it doesn't go into great detail, but could let your imagination go wild.). I most definitely recommend."
1,"Failed to keep my attention, STAY AWAY","This book is based on the journal of a young orphan who is traveling west to California. He goes on the ill-fated Donner Party Expedition. This route was thought to be faster. I took this book out from the library thinking it would be a fun and quick read just like the other My Name Is America, Royal Diaries, and Dear America books. Boy, was I wrong. I found myself struggling to read on. The characters were a bore. The basis was interesting (the reason why i chose the book) but everything else was terrible. Please dont waste your time on this! I recommend The Journal of Scott Pendelton Collins instead of this terrible book. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
3,Not what I thought,"I gifted this to an 8 year old and she had problem understanding the painting on the inside of the jewelry. She also had a hard time doing what she wanted on the small surface area. I would suggest the kit for an older group, like 12 and up. The rings are pretty cool. I will totally wear one once it dries. Warning the paint is NOT washable and you have to paint on it in intervals, otherwise the colors run together."
4,A classic that's nearly perfect,"This is surely one of the finest recordings you can get of the Brahms Fourth. The clarity Szell draws from the Cleveland orchestra is amazing, and every voice is heard. Szell's strength is that he is an exemplary musician. However, this is also his weakness, as he is so rigid in his tempi that he loses much of the dramatic impact of the work. The fourth movement is quite compelling tempo-wise, but lacks that real ""oomph"" that makes a great reading. If you want really engaging emotional involvement, look for Von Karajan or Bernstein. But if you want the most precise musicianship available and ultra-clear voices, the Szell is your pick."
2,Wow,Item was good and comes in handy however the nozzle to control the water is very sensitive and you can't move it without it changing how much water comes flying out. Also not a dripper more of like a heavy stream
4,Little Driper,"I have bought one of the little drippers before for a Chinese Water Dragon, and recently bought anther for a veiled chameleon. They are great additions to any tropical terrarium. I have never had one leak, and they hold so much water. The small holds 79 oz! I only have to refill it every other day and I know that I don't have to worry about my guys going thirsty."
3,Ok,"Good product but it's a difficult to get the right drip speed, but other than that it's a good product"
3,"Too hard to turn on, and velcro doesnt work well","I have this light mounted on an aviation helmet. I can not use the elastic band to hold it on due to the size of the helmet. I used the Velcro, however when I go to turn the light on, the velcro comes undone. The sticky back stays where it is, however the velcro breaks free. If the light had a push button switch, or the turn lens was easier, it would be more useful to me. I may have to look at buying a different light."
5,langdana's touch,wonderfully written for all levels of economic competency. this book should be a prerequisite for reading the wall street journal.
4,Good Reference book. Not a text book that one can learn from.,I must confess that I have no prior knowledge of economics before taking a masters course in macroeconomics. I found it very difficult to learn the subject from the book. The book served me a good reference book. Its not a ideal text book.
1,Meh- Abandoned.,"An attempt to write in the free-form style of Joyce or Kerouac's ""On The Road"" that fails. Unlikely friends, unrealized form and over-worked turgid sentences too full of jargon and name dropping to fulfill the purpose of a book ... communication."
4,Neat RAM drive/disk.,"I put ""important"" stuff on this RAM disk to protect it from loss.Works as expected."
3,Disappointed,"The information on the disc does not match the information on the website about the Orchestra. There are fewer pieces by the Columbia Symphony than advertised and they are also different from those advertised. Given that the Andre Kostelaniz Orchestra is not that great, it turned out the be a disappointing purchase. OK for background music."
4,for-who likes latin-blues cool sound,"Pino Daniele is one of the moste famous italian singer, his most important quality, in making music, is mergering blues sound with afro-latin. But the best presentation of his works is listening them."
3,cute,"This belly ring is cute to be fair. I was worried about it getting caught in clothing alothough that has not become a problem because it is always getting tangled with itself. The tail always gets caught on the arms or legs and leaves the lizard as more of a clump of metal with shiny stones in it. If this functioned better and just hung/dangled the way its intended to, i would definately have given it a higher rating."
3,Not bad,"The book gives large ammount of formulas to work with. However, users that are working with SI units must be aware that not all formulas are accurate. It is advisable to crossreference with other literature."
3,Could be better,"Is not bad for use it as a reference, but only a few chapters like structural analysis and concrete are considerable usefull for me. If your looking for a reference for civil engineering may be this is the book; for other things like a review I did not considered useful."
5,Andreas Dorau = Rock/Funk Gott,"The name of the album is ""Neu"", the name of the artist is Andreas Dorau, so let's focus on his music and not that other German band. This is a great recording, it grooves, his lyrics are quirky and amazingly playful, and the instrumentation is sophisticated electronic brilliance. Andreas has never gotten his proper due as one of Germany's most innovative artists."
2,do not be misled!,"the two reviews theat say this CD is the first album by the band neu! are wrong. the other review is correct: this is not the krautrock classic. i believe that it is actually under copyright control and is only available as a pirate. which is a shame, because it is one of the finest pieces of elctronic music ever made. zen-like in its magnificence. when they make a film of my life, the opening track from neu! will be used to theme the 'tantric sex virginity loss' scene; it is tranquil, sensuous and life-altering (and lasts for 10 minutes - if only!). but, like i said, this CD here is not it, so keep looking."
2,This is NOT by the legendary Neu,"The guy who reviewed this CD before is talking about something else. This is not the legendary kraut-rock band Neu.This is a CD by some Andreas Dorau, and the title of the CD is Neu! ( he sings some 90's disco stuff.. pretty cheap )cp"
5,Tailgate protector,My husband removed a camper shell from his truck and he wasn't happy with the scratches that now were visible on the tailgate. This option worked well covering the scratches and matches perfectly his new RKI aluminum toolbox! New toolbox.....no more scratches.....means one happy man!
5,Great Pal,"I bought this awhile ago and didn't use it untill just recently. I had to extend an addition that someone else had built, and looking at the roof I could tell it was a 4 pitch. When I cut my first rafter and put it on the ridge board the angle was off. I took the pal up on the roof and found the pitch on that side of the roof to be 4 1/4 pitch, so out of curiousty I checked the other side and it was a 4 1/2 pitch. Glad I didn't cut all my rafters beforehand. I also used the pal to mark my rafters for cutting.I hate building after wanna be carpenters!"
2,Not as simple as it looks,Works but not as well as they would like you to believe. You have to be very careful to not reverse the angles and there's no lip on it to use it like a square. I didn't use it for building stairs so it didn't work for the project I purchased it to do.
3,"Good beats, bad guitar","This and the first Rage Against the Machine CD both have strong, funky beats. The difference between the two is the guitar riffs. If the Eels had added another guitar player and not used keyboard as much, this would be a great album. There are some songs like Susan's House and Rags to Rags where the guitar parts are good, but most of the guitar parts are mediocre. However, Tommy is one of the best bass players ever. Too bad he had to leave. Guest List had one of the best bass lines ever..."
4,"Debut, a little up and down but a classic","Mark Everett had already made some albums under the name of ""E"". 'Beautiful Freak' was the first album under the name of Eels, hoping that his E albums would be standing next to the new ones, totally forgetting about bands like the Eagles.The first track of this album to be released is the indie-classic 'Novocaine for the soul' with a great sample and piano intro. Many instruments are used on this album. Piano, Guitar, Banjo and many samples making it an interesting album to listen to. There are no bad songs and some very good ones. Beloved Monster is fun, Spunky very sweet. The quality of songs got better after this album, but this one is very diverse."
3,the cd that complete's any music lovers collection.,"Now I will admit, as much as I love Mr.E, this cd was a bit of a snore. But with songs like Novacaine for the soul, susan's house and your lucky day in hell. It's something that deffinetly needs to be in your collection."
3,Not a masterpiece.,"This is the Eels first album, and also their most accessible. It contains ""Novocaine for the Soul,"" a radio hit that E resents writing enough to never play it live under any circumstances, not to mention many other great and not-so-great pop songs. My main beef with this album is all the cheesy love songs like ""Beautiful Freak"" and ""My Beloved Monster"" that make the insidious ""Fresh Feeling"" seem good in comparison. Don't get me wrong, there's some good songs like ""Susan's House,"" ""Rags to Rags"" and ""Flower"" on here, it's just that the bad ones are really bothersome. Don' t buy this first if you're just getting into the Eels. Instead, try out Electro-Shock Blues or Souljacker."
2,As the old saying goes,"I'm getting too old for this...record. Would have loved it as an attention starved teen. Download ""Novocaine For The Soul"" and move on."
4,A real pleasant surprise,"""Beautiful Disc, Beautiful Disc, that is why, I LOVE YOUOUUUU! "" I bought this CD after hearing Rags To Rags and Novocaine For The Soul. I was expecting a pleasant shallow pop record to just sit back and enjoy. The songs here are much more interesting and demanding than that, though. It's a real charmer, this one, and unlike most records, the CD's 2nd half is its strongest. The album finishes with Spunky, Mental, Your Lucky Day In Hell and Manchild, all light and fluffy yet satisfying listens. Other songs worth checking out are Novocaine For The Soul, the title track, and Not Ready Yet, but the standout is Flower, because its most beautiful moment is its most dissonant. A great, if slightly oddball, listen."
5,absolutely beautiful,"This is an absolutley amazing CD, i've listen to it god knows how many times and i've never got bored of it, it's probably the best album I have. 'E' has a wonderfully original and moving voice and the melodies are beautiful."
5,Original and very cool.,"I love this band...I actually listened to ""Last Stop This Town"" for 4 straight hours. They just keep getting better."
4,Beautiful,"The actual rank should be 4.5 stars, but 0.5 stars are not supported here... The missing 1/2 star is for the pessimistic lyrics. I, personally, am not expecting cds to depress me. You can find plenty of other reasons... Other than that, this is truly a classic. Great musical ideas (not necessarily original) and great sound and production. The songs are pop/rock but loops and other 'electronica tools' are used here and there. All of the songs can be considered 'quiet'. This could be a really 'fun' cd, if the lyrics had been a little happier, but if this is what's on the bands mind, so be it. There is a special edition with a bonus cd. You can skip this edition without thinking twice and get another cd with the change (like Laurie Anderson's strange angels, if you don't have it already)."
3,This is pretty so-so...,"I like a couple of the songs on this CD, but I can't tell which one is which...they all drift, and I wish I could tell them apart because I feel like there's something here that's waiting to happen..."
3,Glad they broke on radio,"Coming out when the 2nd-gen alterna-acts we're just catching wind, Eels debut has demonstrated a longer importance then many less distinguished acts of the time. While there is not enough personality to warrant high praise (the band autopilot's in their drearily hip mode a little too often), chief songwriter ""E"" demonstrates keen dark-pop chops by way of piano or guitar, creating a few hauntingly upbeat, not to mention sardonically lyricized snapshots amongst less memorable, but still competent tracks."
2,Dissapointing,A decent gloss over for pairs trading. Would have been a much better book if it were released 10 years ago. But its an easy read for someone just wanting to get a handle on trading pairs. Anyone with even some experience will want to steer clear.
1,disappointing book,"I had hoped to get a deep insight in the math and statistics behind pair trading, but everything mentioned in the book is of a very qualitative nature. Also, the lay-out is highly primitive, with formulas being hardly legible. Definitely not worth its money."
4,So much Nonsense,"I read this book and I think I got out of it what I was intended to... a clear understanding of pairs trading. Not ground-breaking theory, just a solid understanding. There seems to be so much written here that seems like Mark Whistler trashing the competition that I decided not to buy that book on principle. Given that all these fake revies are full of grammatical and spelling errors, though claiming to be written by true scholars, made me wonder how poorly written the book would be. I can say with certainty that even if Mr. Ehrman's book is basic, it is well written and clear. I'll never find out about the other because I'm not buying into this petty (...)."
5,Sci-fi Classics - The Best,"This classic set is a must for Sci-fi fans. Collected most on VHS and to have them on DVD - well, like the Monotilth Monsters - it ROCKS"
4,wow,"wow what a collection of classics. The Incredible Shrinking Man must have been really terrifying in its day. It still got me tense watching it now. OK Universal bring on some more classics in 5 packs, they are great."
4,A mixed bag for sure!,"These are the movies I watched as a kid, and I'll probably trundle over to Best Buy (ugh!) to pick up this set, but I have to wonder why they chose these particular movies, when at least two of them are trash and could have been replaced with much better selections. Incredible Shrinking Man is a classic, and Tarantula is pretty decent for its genre and era. I've never seen Monolith Monsters, and this new set will give me the chance to do that. So far, so good. But Monster on the Campus and Mole People are just crap, no matter how you try to pretend otherwise. Why didn't they include It Came From Outer Space and This Island Earth instead of those two clunkers? If they'd done so, this really WOULD be The Classic Ultimate Sci-Fi Collection ... or at least The Universal-International Ultimate Sci-Fi Collection. (Most of the REAL classics from this era were released by other studios.) As it stands, I had to stretch to give this four stars."
2,Great Movies Deserve Better Treatment,"Don't get me wrong, these are classic movies, especially ""Incredible Shrinking Man"", but don't you think they deserve special treatment? A documentary, commentary, any extras at all??? Still, this is an attractive package, and the transfers are clear. But the casual way Universal dumped these films on the market (Best Buy only) is really an insult to the fans. Universal's monster movies are on their third release and loaded with extras (Frankenstein & Dracula most recently). Maybe someday."
4,RICH'S MONSTER MANIA,"YES I ENJOYED THE CLASSIC SCI-FI COLLECTION FROM UNIVERSAL.TARANTULA,SHRINKING MAN AND MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS WERE REALLY GOOD,JUST MONOLITH MONSTERS DOES SLOW DOWN IN PARTS.COULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER MOVIE,THE IDEA WAS THERE,AND THE MOLE PEOPLE WAS A FAVORITE OF MINE WHEN I SAW IT IN THE MOVIES WHEN I WAS YOUNG,IT WAS ON A DOUBLE UNIVERSAL BILL WITH CARURU BEAST OF THE AMAZON WITH JOHN BROMFIELD AND BEVERLY GARLAND.I RATED THIS 4 STARS AND I WILL WATCH IT AGAIN.WHEN COMPANY COMES OVER,BREAK OUT THE CLASSIC SCI FI."
5,Getting back to the past.,I totally enjoyed all the films in the video. It brought back those days being entertained and frightened by these classics. There sort of campy but that is what entertained us back then. Glad to see them again. You won't be disappointed.
3,Horrifyingly inevitable sci-fi with imaginative touches gracing a cheap production...,"The plot is simple: after being exposed to a mysterious, possibly radioactive mist, a man finds he is slowly but inexorably diminishing in size... His pride, job, marriage and, finally, his very life are threatened as his relation to the world about him changes daily... A cellar floor becomes a stark desert where giant insects hunt prey and the only food consists of rock-like crumbs of stale cheese left in mousetraps...Arnold's expert use of huge sets and props provides excitement, but it is the philosophical script that supplies its rare power: complacent modern man, forced back on his primitive wits simply to survive, finally discovers hope, peace and meaning in the realization that everything in the cosmos, however small or insignificant, has its own place and worth..."
2,Not Very Well Written,"This was an average work for this topic range. The writing was not as peppy as most people need to keep this subject matter moving. If you are really interested in this particular issue then I would suggest this book, if you are looking for better business driven books then I would suggest Den of Thief's or Barbarians at the Gate."
2,Adam Runaway,"Adam Hanaway, also known as Runaway since he tends to run away from confrontations, is trying to return his family's fortune. His father lost it all and then killed himself. Adam left London to go to Portugal and work for his uncle's import company. He is hoping to prove himself so he can eventually move up the chain of comman and help his mother and sister financially. While there he finds himself accused of fraud, falls in love, and is eventually involved in a dangerous scheme with the possiblity of making him a fortune.The story itself was quite good, but it was a bit drawn out. While I enjoy reading a character's internal dialoge, there was a bit too much of it for my taste. It seemed a bit repetitive. He continually talked about how he was tired of be cowardly but never really tries to be any different. I did enjoy his relationship and interaction with his neightbors very much. They were the highlight of the book for me.2/5"
3,A Tedious Bore,"The author brilliantly takes one of the most fascinating cities ever in its most exciting time, and manages to come up with a real page snoozer. Nothing really happens, and what does happen, happens off-stage. (The Great Lisbon Earthquake mentioned by another reviewer takes up one sentance at the end as a flashback!)If you want to spend hours with a character with NO character, no backbone, little street sense and not a whit of maturity, then this is for you. I finished it because it was the only book I had brought to the beach, but in the end I realized that the sound of waves crashing was a lot more interesting."
4,Entertaining insight into WWE duo,"I'm not a big fan of WWE but I'd read Kurt Angle's and Bill Goldberg's biographies and I thought I might enjoy this. The good news is that I did. The Hardy Boyz manage to put across their contrasting personalities and it was fun learning about their early life and first steps into pro wrestling - they've certainly earned their dues.The structure of the book works well. Matt and Jeff take turns to tell their experiences so it's as if you're reading a magazine interview with them. The photos are great too. A picture of Jeff jobbing for Razor Ramon before he got trendy with his street image, is worth the cover price alone.On the downside, the long descriptions of individual matches towards the end of the book get a bit tedious but overall this is an exciting, informative guide to the Hardy brothers."
2,When is Billy Gunn writing a book?,"I only give this book two stars to be kind. I don't understand why everyone has an autobiography. They should be reserved for icons and legends who are willing to be honest and will write a piece of literature that will contribute to the history of wrestling. Much like Chyna, Lita, Bill Goldberg and Diamond Dallas Page, this is another novelty joke of an autobiography. Writing a book used to mean something and these people are urinating on what it takes to be author.It is hard enough to fight for the respect of the business when there are really good books out there for the business. However, we got these mock authors who write their jokes of an autobiography. It is not right for these pieces of to be published. I am waiting for the useless life stories of Bill DeMott and Billy Gunn. I guess I ever have a 3 legged table they will come in handy."
4,WELL WORTH THE 265 PAGES,"THIS BOOK EXPLORES THE LIFE OF THE HARDY BOYZ, WHO ENJOYED SUCCESS IN THE WWE AS 6-TIME WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS AND SINGLES CHAMPIONSHIPS. I LOVED HOW THE BOOK ACTUALLY TOLD ME SOME THINGS ABOUT THE HARDYS' PAST THAT I DIDN'T KNOW. LIKE, HOW THEY STRUGGLED IN THE WWE SINCE 1994 AND HOW THEY FORMED THEIR OWN WRESTLING COMPANY, CALLED THE TWF. THIS IS A GOOD BOOK. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECCOMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANY PERSON OUT THERE THAT'S THINKING ABOUT GETTING INTO THE WRESTLING BUSINESS. TOO BAD THAT JEFF HARDY IS NO LONGER WITH THE WWE."
5,Best Book Ever,This book by far one of the best one's I have read in a while I may have gotten it late (a while after it came out) but it didn't matter I'm just now reading it all the way (before I just read diffent parts) and I'm so proud 2 say I'm a Hardy Fan and have been for year's even tho the Hardy Boy's aren't a tag team anymore this book isn't just about them when they were a tag team this is after all that behide the fame this book come's with photo that I have 2 say I love some people have seen before and some people havn't this book does talk about Amy (fan's know her better as Lita) getting hurt on the set of Dark Angel and it tell that part of there lifes and thing's I didn't even know about the boy's and I trought I knew all there was 2 know about them this is a great book for any Hardy Boy's fan.
5,A Vital Tool!,Dr. Stoddard's book is a vital tool for the understanding the events as they have been unfolding regarding the War on Terror. The book is a clear and conscise reflection of events and also contains detailed profiles of the numerous countires envolved. Students as well as academics will find the text both interesting and insightful. It is a page turner that packs an enormous amount of information into a small package. A must read--a must have!
2,More Samurai Than Star Trek,"""Shadow Lord"" deals with politcal intrigue, samurai-style warfare, and tribal politics on a planet poised to join the Federation. It is hardly a Star Trek novel. Spock and Sulu are the only characters who are present in the entire story. Kirk and McCoy appear briefly at the beginning and end, and that's it for the Star Trek personalities. The writing is decent enough, but the story line is often one-dimensional. The descriptions of sword fighting and equipment are detailed (and graphically violent), but the author doesn't offer very deep insights into any of the characters. Particularly disappointing was the glossing over of Sulu's having broken the Prime Directive."
2,Shadow Lord,"In my opinion, Laurence Yep has never read a Star Trek novel in his life, and the editor probably hadn't either. Often, facts become distorted and don't concur with previously established facts. The story did have a decent plot line - for a fantasy novel, not a science fiction novel."
3,"Seriously, Pacifier was WAY better..","This is alright, but they need to change their name back to Pacifier and bust out some more hard rockin grunge songs like Semi-Normal, Something's Wrong, Bullitproof, etc... This is basically Pacifier without all the catchy hooks and flare...somewhat mediocre night in terms of music and vocals."
2,Copying themselves.,"Unfortunatly this band ""Shihad"" are way to busy trying to be their ""Killjoy"" album again, copying it and trying to repeat themselves.Its a shame, cause they could of really made a great album, but this just is'nt the Shihad that made them what they really are.Get Churn, Killjoy, Shihad, The general electric."
3,Good but read on...,"The Light of Eidon is a great fantasy book and a nice kick off for a new series. But here's some things against it: as many reviewers have said, there are SLOW parts. Many fantasy stories have slow parts in them...I think Karen has perfected that in this story. That shouldn't take away from you enjoying Abramm and his experiences. Secondly I didn't really connect with the characters other than the main guy. Is that the point? If it is, then Karen does a good job.If nothing else, read this book for the final battle. Fantasy battles are wonderful..especially final climactic ones."
3,Thinly veiled Christian propaganda,"The story and the writing are decent. Unfortunately, you have to wade through a lot of preaching to actually read the story. The worst of the preaching doesn't start until about half way through the book. By that time, you're stuck wanting to finish the story. Like the Narnia series, a large part of the story is about belief in a God and his son that died for humanity and was resurrected (sound familiar?). It's too bad that so many of these authors can't make up their own stories instead of stealing from the Bible. The preaching really destroys the enjoyment of the story. Unless you're fanatically Christian, you might want to spend your time on a different book."
4,solid fantasy book,"I really enjoyed reading the start of this new series. The characters are well-developed and I find the similarities to christian themes very interesting. It's been several months since i read this and it still stands out in my mind. I remember the characters, their trials and tribulations, and the great storyline. at times the book seems a bit too long or a bit too descriptive but surprisingly, I did not skim it which I normally would do. I'm looking forward to reading the remaining books in the series."
5,Hooked,"This is one of the best books I've read. The characters, the plot, the storyworld, all of it was very well done and made it difficult to put the book down. Congratulations Karen on writing an awesome book. I didn't know what to expect from Christian Fanstasy, but you've got me sold."
4,This may not be for you.,"First off, I thought the book was great! I liked the development of the characters, the changes in scenery, as well as the twists and turns the plot took. Although it was, at times, like riding a boat in an ocean with great swells and then down turns in pace until the next swell, overall it kept my attention.People who dislike this book seem to do so more out of a feeling that they were surprised that it was based on Christian values/morals... whatever. This to me is of no consequence. If had undertones of Allah, Buddha, Aphrodite, or any other god, I would be fine with it as well. It is a fiction book and should be treated as such. While I enjoyed the different views the author took on the subject of Christianity, many people found it offensive.In short, if you are offended by something you don't believe in, this may not be for you."
3,"Good Writing, Not Sure if I liked the Story or Not Though","I found myself annoyed at the main characters a lot - their stupidity and stubbornness became too much at times. And while I knew this was Christian fiction, believe me when I say it's much more *heavily* Christian than I was anticipating. Not that that's a bad thing (I actually read quite a bit of it), I'm just putting it out there. Carissa's character ... eh. She wants to be a strong female character, but I just didn't connect with her and found her mostly annoying. I mean, come on,*******Spoiler******** it takes you *years* to try and track down your brother, when you set out a day or so behind him? Also, he's pretty famous, so, it's not like he's hard to track down. Yes, you had obstacles in your way, but seriously? ******* end of spoiler********I liked Abramm. His growth was believable. Will I read the next books in the series? Hmmm, I haven't decided yet."
4,Great Read,Loved the story line and the way it looks at the relationship we have with Christ. It shows the subtlety of evil and how we can lie to ourselves and see it as truth.
5,Captivating and interesting,"This is an excellent story with a nice blend of fantasy, faith and ancient tribal kingdom / fiefdom elements. Written in a style that keeps you wanting to read more, this will make you want to read the next book to find what happens next. Unlike some writers whose story doesn't seem to come to a logical, or satisfactory conclusion at the end of each book, this one ended well, while leaving the way for the next book to pick up and continue the story.I will definitely be reading all the books in this series."
4,"Good story, great detail","I got this book through an EReader recommendation, and was surprised to enjoy it as much as I did. The story is good, despite the obvious parallels to various real-world religions and cultures, and the characters are well-developed, to the point where the reader will actually find himself caring what happens to them. The details of the various cultures and settings in the story add to it and for me were the best part of the story. I sometimes actually found myself wishing the author would go into a little more depth and give more background about some of the cultural references that were only lightly touched on, but hinted at a deeper background story.The weakest part of the story was the fairly predictable plot and almost obligatory occurrences that advanced the storyline. But even when you know your destination, the journey can be enjoyable if the scenery along the way is good. I would recommend this book to fantasy fans. It's worth the read."
4,Good book,"It was hard at first to understand what was going on, but i got into it and by the middle of the book i couldnt keep myself away from it!"
3,The writing was good but...,"I agree, that the story was well written, but I'm almost to the end and am still waiting for a plot. If this was a story about a fragile boy becoming a man through his mis-adventures, I guess that's it then. I can't say I thoroughly entertained, but sufficiently so that I stuck with it, just to see where it would end up, but all the same I kept feeling like I was waiting for something - anything - to happen. It never did."
4,enjoyed it,"i'm not much for religious fantasy--actually, i didn't know they had that category until now--but i really enjoyed this book."
2,Not the fantasy i was expecting,"It starts out like it might be an interesting fantasy book but it gets very religious fast. It's about a young man trying to figure out which religion is the ""real one"". I don't like the whole ""my religion is the true one"" but also it was poorly written. The action was boring and slow. There was an attempt at character depth but failed. Im not one to leave a book unfinished so I finished it. Im not at all interested in how the series ends."
2,"reworking of christian themes, buyer beware","this was well written but the strong christian theme was overwhelming. the plot is unoriginal and is losely based on the conflict between christians, jews, and muslims(with muslims protrayed as evil) . very disappointing and a total waste of money"
2,Unconvincing,It started out interesting but got tedious very quickly. The characters and situations felt very contrived and there was no real suspense. It was obvious that the hero is destined to triumph (with the right attitude) despite all the impossible situations the author put him into.
4,Simply wonderful!,"This book was one of the best that I have read in a long time. Hancock manages to pull the reader in with political intrigue, suspense, adventure, and even the struggle of choice and surrender to something out of our hands.I enjoyed it so much, and could barely put it down. The only reason this review is 4 stars is I felt it was a little contrived. This story, at the time when I read it, seemed a bit cliché--Abramm being sold into slavery, a gladiator... Just too fantastical... But, upon reading the second book, I learned that Abramm _IS_ meant for something more... You should definitely read the second book. (But read the first first)"
3,"Entertaining, but no surprises","This is a very engaging, well-written book. But for those who have been steeped in fantasy, there are really no surprises. The plot is pretty much a combination of things you'll have seen in Ben Hur, Spartacus, and any other gladiator type story with a bit of tame magic/religion thrown in to boot.As an advertised piece of Christian literature, it's not surprising to find so many clear parallels between the author's invented religion and Christianity. But the best thing I can say about the book is that all of this can be totally ignored as it is largely irrelevant to the plot. Yes, the finding of faith is central to the story, but reading at purely the surface level still provides a good adventure. And, I guess, that is the mission of good Christian literature; it delivers its message subtly rather than beating the reader over the head with its message."
2,Not a book for non-Christians,"This book is a fantasy based in a very heavy handed way on the Christian faith. Oddly it somehow manages to make the Christian world, which you would think be shown in a positive way, as just a bit creepy. Well actually more than a bit creepy. The writing is certainly well down. The characters have depth and the plot line is interesting. You want to know what happens and it is an easy read. I am sure that for those who share the value system in this book, this will be a fine story to follow. For me, even though I feel compelled to finish a story line, I find myself unwilling to dive back into what I feel is fouled water."
1,Bleh,"The book may have been well written, as in good sentence structure, but the story was bleh. Nothing original and nothing stood out, and it was hard to get into. It felt like a forced story from page 1, and it made it impossible for me to even immerse myself into the story itself.I very rarely stop reading something when I start it, but this book would have gone in the trash (if it wasn't a digital copy), I wouldn't even have donated it to the library because I wouldn't want anyone else to suffer.This author is going on my no buy list (Granted this book was free, and I now know why)."
1,Christian Fantasy Fiction,"If I had read a couple of reviews I would understand this is a thinly veiled Christian novel, which is fine but not what I was after. The first 25% was a good interesting read, which descended into rote action novel doldrums and finally the last half of the book resolved to be tortuously preachy and really just boring."
1,"Amazon, please categorize faith based novels appropriately.","This is the second fantasy novel I downloaded not knowing the authors were Christian writers. I have no issue with faith based novels - I simply do not wish to read them (I have my own faith, thank you very much). Readers ought to be given the choice."
3,enjoyable read,"This is the first Kindle book I've read. It was also my first book to read by this author. I downloaded it to read on a long plane ride. I was pleasantly surprised that it was a ""full"" book and not just a novella like I expected for an e-book.I enjoyed the book. As a Christian, I saw many obvious allegories between Christ and Tertius and actually thought about giving an e-copy of the book to a non-Christian friend I have been sharing my faith with. Under the right circumstances, it could be used as a witnessing tool.As a fantasy fan, there were times I thought the religious allegories were a bit overdone. Both Tolkien and Lewis were also Christians who wrote allegories, but they tended to be a bit more subtle about it. Regardless, it was an enjoyable book and I do plan to read others in the series."
5,"Intriguing, breathtaking, fabulous!","A fabulous piece of work by Karen Hancock! I found myself holding my breath in spots, crying in others! Amazing, and uplifting!"
2,I'm hoping for more in book 2,"My first Kindle reading experience, Light of Eidon was not all I'd hoped it would be. I have never read Karen Hancock before, but others had recommended it as akin to Tolkein and so I went in with high expectations indeed. I think many of the elements for good fantasy are there, but at times I had a hard time weeding through the plot and allegory. Elements of various stories, the Biblical Joseph and David as well as Martin Luther came through for me, but the storyline shifted a bit and became hard to follow at times. Given that it is the first book in a series and has a lot of characters to develop as well as a whole world to create, I may give the second book a chance to see if I can get into the world a little more."
4,Good job - Worth the read,"Once you get used to the characters, the story moves well. Not too graphic, well written. Download the free ebook. I think I'll check out her books for purchase."
3,Good try author has potential,Author has talent but untrained. Recommend author read David Eddings Dennis Mckiernan for future guidance. 'Nuff said and if you dont understand what I mean then you are hopeless.
5,Thoroughly Engaging,Good fiction that also contains positive Christian values is a rarity. I not only enjoyed the well written fiction with its complex characters and plot but also it served as a motivation to share my faith! I couldn't put it down!!
5,Fantastical Fantasy,Loved this book and I truly related with the struggle of the characters. I would put this book on my shelf next to the Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis.
5,One of my favorite,"I love reading Christian fiction freebies on my Kindle so I was excited when I saw this one. Immediately, I was drawn into the story. I fell in love with the characters and couldn't put this book down. I have read many medieval/royal family/legendy kind of books and this is one of my favorites. The Christian allegories are wonderful and get you thinking.I loved this book so much, I went out and bought the series. I highly recommend those as well."
1,Very 1 dimensional,"I read it all the way through and was glad it was free. The book takes most of it's story from Spartacus, but with a simple, black & white evangelical spin. Mot much depth to any of the characters. Not worth the $0 I spent on it. I just want Amazon to stop recommending other books in this series."
1,"""tricked into reading about Jesus"" - it is so true","Reminded me of the shameless tactics college Christian groups would pull where you think you're going to an event to meet people to only find that it's sponsored by Christian group to ""bring you to the light"" and convert you to Jesus.Same thing happened to me with this book. There was nothing in the standard review to indicate that this was anything other than a fantasy novel. If only i had read the user reviews! I tried to tolerate it but could not finish because the author keeps slamming the same spiritual concepts written over and over again. Made me look into how to delete a book from my inventory because this was the most shameless brainwashing, bible-banging, masquerading as a fantasy book out there. Watch out!"
3,Light of Eidon,"I read this book because I loved Areana. I don't think it was as good as Areana though. It was fairly exciting, and the ending was wonderful! I still want to read the second one, but I am going to wait on buying it. The last battle Abrhmm fights had me spellbound. Overall it was pretty good."
4,Light of Eidon awesome allegory!,Light of Eidon is an alligorical story that brings spirtitual reality to life in a fictional world that is familiar and unfimiliar at the same time. I am not usually into Sci-Fi but this book has enough twists in it to keep my attention.
5,Wonderfully gripping,"I read The Light of Eidon a couple of years ago and I'm reading it again now. I am enjoying it every bit as much as I did the first time--actually more! If you love fantasy where real truths shine through and God's love and mercy are portrayed with startling clarity, then read The Light of Eidon."
3,Good but SLOW,This Novel was quite good except from the fact that as many reviewers have said it is extremely SLOW there are some parts in which you can't stop reading but others in which you want throw your kindle to the floor
5,exceptional characters couldn't put down,I don't usually do reviews but this book is so exceptionally written I just couldn't put it down and when I had finished I had to quickly go and buy the rest of the series. The depth of characters and story are vivid and feel like they are alive and now after one book close friends can't wait to see where the rest of the series takes me.
2,"Precise, clinical performances in dated sound","Perhaps no eminent conductor has fallen so far after his death as George Szell. He was treated with enormous respect during his long tenure with the Cleveland Orchestra, and he couldn't appear in Carnegie Hall without getting raves from the New York critics (his reviews were much better than Bernstein's). On the evidence of this cold, unfeeling CD of Wagner excerpts, mostly from the Ring, one wonders why. Every excerpt is treated to the same strict, unyielding approach; there is no rubato or romanticism. In addition the sound is thin and full of hiss (Szell's LPs on Epic were infamous for their bad sound, and Sony hasn't bothered to improve things on their digitual reissue.)I will remember Szell fondly from my formative years in the Sixties, but he has become a dead letter in the intervening decades."
2,Classical Elevator Music,"The music lackes the fire I like from Wagner. The music from ""What's Opera Doc"" holds your interest better."
4,Nice tires.,"These tires are great ""street tire"" replacements for mountain bike knobby tires. These are still big, fat tires, which would also be right at home on a cruiser bike. I was thinking they would be a bit skinnier, but maybe that's just me. The picture makes then look rounder than the two that I was sent. Mine are almost rectangular on my wheels.BIG FAT TIRES!"
5,Cheng Shin C1218 Street Tire,"Nice tires, sticky rubber compound and smooth rolling. A little taller than average, stiff sidewalls, not quite rounded and not quite squared off on the profile, seems to be a little of both. Looks great on a mountain bike converted to street use. Love the tires so far, have another set I'm going to put on my Cruiser when I get time and I'm going to purchase a couple more sets for my kids Cruisers too."
5,Awesomely Smooth Ride & Affordability,"I was looking for a set of slick tires that had a slight tread pattern for one of my cruisers, and I am delighted to have found the Cheng Shin C1218. I get the incredible rolling resistance I want at a budget price! For those who like a black wall tire, the look is there. Give this tire a try!"
2,Not cracked up to be what is expected!,"I was a beginner with microchips PIC's when I purchased this book. My high expectations were left shallow after reading Easy PIC'n. In fact, it was no help when I started my first project. The data sheet supplied at no cost from microchips website was jammed packed with more info than Easy PIC'n. In fact, I feel that Easy PIC'n was a re-write of the data sheet. The book was very vague in describing the specific functions of the assembler instructions used with the PIC and the architecture involved. If you are a beginner with PIC's I would suggest first by reading the data sheet and any other resources off of microchips web site. If you have absolutely no idea of how to write the assembler language, I would suggest buying a book specifically designed to teach you programming. If you want more of my thoughts or need help deciding what to do, feel free to e-mail me at <camerlin@ovis.net>"
1,bad intro book - poorly written and organised,"definitely not a useful book for a beginner. i'm shockedthat someone would actually try and pass this off for a bookand try to publish it and make money from it. there is much better info on the web - avoid it if you're lookingfor an intro. and if you're not, i don't see how this bookwould be more useful than just looking at the microchip datasheets."
3,"It's useful, but somewhat rambling","This book contains a reasonable amount of accessible information about programming a MicroChip PIC microcontroller. The writing could be improved substantially, but you'll figure it out if you know something about the subject. It at least gets you off ground zero."
4,Easy Pic'N: If you're new to PICs get this.,"I bought this book when I started with PICs (2003). After skimming many of the newer books as they have come out, I still regard this as the best intro guide for newbies.The book gives you the essentials to get started with simple projects and with these essentials, you can make some fairly involved projects of your own.The PIC16f84 is getting a little long in the tooth but the instruction set translates to newer more powerful controllers that are cheaper as well.The lack of used copies for sale might tell you something about the value of this book: I'm not selling mine either!"
4,I was at Town Hall!!!,"This was the best concert I ever saw.I had the 4 record box set (vinyl)which is no longer available. I've been looking to replace my 4 record box set since 1990. I was so happy when they brought it out on a DVD which I have. The complete concert is not on the DVD. The live show was almost 4 hours long, every one was there, it was the most amazing life experience I have had at a concert. This is just a sample of what the show was and how great the music of jazz is. Enjoy!!!"
4,"some great, some good some otherwise",As with most concerts with many groups this followed suit by being exceptional then mediocre. Thank goodness for fast forward
3,Diasappointing reissue,"I have had the two laser disk version of this show for a long time and this version is not only missing several excellent Charles Lloyd Quartet performance but has, in some insane effort to include the audience substituted some decidedly inferior angles to change the original footage. As such its a big disappointment. Frankly, I think the laser disk version is clearly superior. The few extra added cuts are nice but the missed footage is inexcusable."
5,Loved the Bryan Adams song!,I gave tgis item a 5 only because of the EXCELLENT song and performance by BRYAN ADAMS! Kudos to him for his longevity!!!
2,Still another film telling the same story over again,"It is truly amazing how many times a story can be told without people getting tired of it. The plot of this tale must have appeared in hundreds of books and films. There is a joke about a minister. He gave the same sermon every year. ""How,"" his friend asked, ""can you get away with doing this?"" ""It is simple,"" he answered, ""I just change the story that I insert into the sermon."" It is the same with this film. The tale has been told before, but the writers inserted a little twist into the tale that make people think they are seeing something new."
2,Well-Intentioned Bomb,"Handsomely produced in Tunisia, with some respectable ""name"" actors in the cast, this well-intentioned mess wastes all its advantages on an astonishingly clumsy script riddled with absurd plot turns, gross historical anachronisms, and groan-inducing dialog. The basic premise isn't bad, although it's a bit of a stretch historically: an ailing emperor Tiberius sends a trusted investigator to Judea to look into the facts and rumors surrounding the trial and execution of Jesus of Nazareth. But from there on, it's all down hill. And the climax, in which a swishy Caligula murders his uncle Tiberius to keep him from issuing an edict making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, boggles the mind. Not worth even the reduced cost of the DVD or the time it takes to watch it, unless you can enjoy the locations and costumes and ignore everything else."
5,Beautiful epic tale,"This movie is beautiful story of love, faith, and redemption. It is also pretty historically accurate. Monica Cruz (sister of Penelope) gives an unforgettable performance as Tabatha. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys historical films, films set in Biblical times, or simply a beautiful love story."
2,"Buy ""The Inquiry"" ... Junk > ""The Final Inquiry""","Bad dubbing, too much of a chick flick, some blond/blue-eyed Hebrews in the cast (refugees from ABBA?). Disappointing. Jesus holds his hands up like some Byzantine painting as Lazarus rises..looks like he running for office trying hush a convention crowd.F. Murray Abraham should do an Apostle Paul film as the lead...please read the Bible account before you write script!! PLEASE! Why is this concept so difficult to understand?"
1,Lousy movie,"Shipper did a great job. Product arrived in a reasonable time and was in great shape. The movie, however, was a real stinker. Of course, that's not the sellers fault."
1,Christian Cheese,"My husband and I rented this to see if we wanted to purchase it for our library. It was the most painful waste of time. The front cover of the video and the synopsis at the back were far better than the actual movie. I don't mind historical fiction, but this was a case of bad acting, bad directing, choppy story lines, and a terrible script. If I'd wanted melodrama (Caligula, anyone?), a take on ""Sleeping Beauty"", and the chance to see a beautiful set with some attractive actors, this movie would have been it. But I was looking for a serious drama that would draw me in and intrigue me. Sadly, this movie was not it. I'm so glad we did not buy this movie. You couldn't pay me to own it."
3,"Good, but lacks polish","It had an interesting storyline, and it was never really boring. But you could tell that it lacked polish in many areas; for example, the ""earthquake"" in the opening sequence where the trees stood still and all it really looked like was someone was shaking the camera while people pretended to stagger around. Some of the dialog was strange too and seemed unpolished. However, it was still enjoyable and had a solid storyline."
1,Too bad they don't crusify in Rome any more,because everyone that had anything to do with this stinker should be offed. An obvious attempt by clueless bafoons to cash in on The Passion market.
4,The Final Inquiry,"The dvd was shipped in a good and timely manner, new and neatly packaged as expected."
3,Okay at best,"Nice story. Nice cinematography. Good looking actors and actresses. Mediocre script. mediocre acting.This story could have been much more poignant. They went out of their way costume-wise to make it authentic-looking as possible, but somewhat flat dialogue. The Last Legion is just a slight bit better than this movie.THe cinematography, nonetheless, is very good. Beautiful.Not a bad watch, but could have been better."
2,Broken Rotor,The kids (and adults) had fun with this but the rotor broke before x-mas vaction ended. Now it's collecting dust. Can a new rotor be purchased?
1,NEVER GOT TO PLAY WITH IT,"THIS THING WAS DEFECTIVE WHEN THE BOX WAS OPENED. BOUGHT IT FOR 9.99, GOING IN THE GARBAGE. COOL TOY IF IT WERE MORE DURABLE."
4,NEED A NEW ROTOR,The toy is great but one of the kids fell on the rotor. Is there any way you can help me get a new rotor for this toy? We'd greatly appreciate it.Gene Savettiere30 Eugene DriveMontville NJ 07045
2,These reek!,"The weights are your basic weights. I have no problem with that. What I do have issue with, however, is that unlike the photo, my weights arrived with a cheap silver spray paint job done to them. The inside of the box they arrived in had some of the paint rub off on them. When I picked them up, I had silver dust on my hands. And the weights have a HORRIBLE smell to them, apparently from the paint."
3,apparent factory seconds,"It's nice to get olympic plates delivered to your door at these rates. Yes, the shipping really is free for many orders over $25 (but watch carefully, some things don't get free shipping and they don't tell you this until you are only the final order page.) Most of my order arrived within a week, but some is still outstanding at ten days. No big deal here.However, the plates I received are slightly damaged, having various cosmetic defects like chips and the cheesy paint job mentioned by the earlier poster, which is probably hiding rust acquired in a warehouse. All in all, I really don't care that my plates are imperfect, but esports should disclose upfront that they are selling factory seconds."
5,The Tilly Trotter Trilogy,"Over the years I have read all of Catherine Cookson's books as soon as they came out. The Tilly Trotter series was always one of my favorites. Sometimes the books would come out in the United Kingdom before they reached the US. As an avid traveler, I would purchase books in train stations and often would come across a Cookson book that I had not found here at home. Traveling across England while reading about the towns that I came through made the books that much more poignant. Now, many years later I am rereading my old favorites. The characters are just as real to me now as when I first read about them and just as unforgettable."
4,A thoughtful and scholarly examination,"Students of religion and mysticism will find this an insightful and scholarly look into the field. Carmody & Carmody have written a book that examines mysticism in several of its most common forms, from the standpoint of many of the world's most populous religions.The book is organised, roughly, by each particular faith: mysticism within Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. Each section offers a short historical overview of the religion itself, then delves into its manifestations of mystical holiness.Truly a masterful work, and one which also possesses the remarkable gift of being extremely readable. A hearty recommendation for the book!"
5,This soap helps to cure chronic dry skin,"This was a great purchase and I'll be back for more, I'm sure. It might seem a little pricey for soap, but it beats spending the extra money on lotions and emollients that really don't give you a return on your money. Though this soap is not fragranced in the same way many soaps are these days, it's made in the traditional way with natural ingredients. It's truly a great buy! My mother has had a tremendous problem with dry skin (cracking and bleeding) due to chemotherapy and radiation treatments and she absolutely loves this soap! She says there is very little need to use lotion when using this soap on a daily basis.When I would get out of the shower and forget to put lotion on, my skin would itch insessantly, enough to keep me awake for hours just itching (I have very sensitive skin and some lotions made me itch too). Using this soap daily has stopped all of that from happening. I LOVE THIS SOAP and you will too!"
4,Savon de Marseille Olive Soap,I think this soap product is a great value for the money. The bar was larger than I anticipated. The scent is okay and it does not dry out your skin.
4,nice one!,"This soap is amazing. i love it. my boyfriend even loves it! the only thing that i cant figure out is how to smoothly cut the soap down when you by an enormous block. after i solve that mystery, it will be perfect!"
2,I have ordered this soap twice now and been disappointed both times.,"I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time. It is hard to find this type of soap. But the soap is not aesthetically pleasing and while I understand and appreciate the handmade nature of the soap, it just is sort of slimy and the smell is not the usual Savon de Marseille smell. On the plus side, it is a big bar and the shipping was timely. I will use the soap- it's not that bad, but I won't be ordering again."
3,great for dry skin but no pretty smell,"When I first got this I almost didn't use it because the smell was kind of nothing. I used it and now I like it because it doesn't dry my skin out so much. But the smell is so so and my skin still gets dried out, so I will keep looking for something natural that has a bit more of a pleasant smell and makes you hands softer. Definately good to keep on hand as back up or for the kids to share with you."
1,Rancid,Pros: Received soap in boxCons: Soap smelled like rancid/putrid olive oil. It was misshapen and discolored with white spots all over it. It was stuck to the paper that it was wrapped in. I ran it under water hoping (stupidly) that perhaps the smell would get better. It did not. I sliced a piece off thinking that only the outer part smelled. I was wrong. It stunk through and through. I threw it away as the smell was disgusting.
1,It has a fancy name but its pure crap,"Cons:-smells HORRID-doesnt moisturize, and leaves a wierd feeling on your skin while and after you are finnished bathing. have you ever took your hand and ran it along the roof of a car? felt awkward didnt it? not smooth, soft and supple...just awkward...-it was so difficult to grip the bar of soap because it was so big and it didnt have any type of a string or anything tied to it.-doesnt lather well at all-crumples easilyPros:-long lasting (sometimes it felt like i was bathing with a big rock)-a generous sized piece of soap-its mild and gentle yes.. :)"
2,not as expected,"I have used this soap many times in the past, and usually love it. However, this batch is a real disappointment. I ordered several bars as Christmas gifts, but when they arrived and I opened them to have a look (glad I did), they are not even completely cured. The bars are discolored and white-edged and squished around the edges. Very wet, and wrapped in paper that is stuck in many spots.Can't even read the logo on the bars. Guess I'll keep these for household use, and start shopping again for the daughters-in-law. I'm happy enough with the timeliness of the order, etc."
3,quality counts on it,I like it. It has a big easy to read face. One feature that I was not certain about was the alarm. It works. Overall good value. The leather strap is thick and durable. The illumination is terrific. If I were going to make a purchase today I would do it again.
3,what about the details?,I just received the watch today. It's a great looking watch and am thrilled with it except for one detail...there's no working battery! I've never bought a watch before and not gotten a battery before so now I have to spend more time and money to get up to speed.
4,A book exploring the pathologies related to internal clots.,"A very intruiging perspective, got me interested in live blood analysis (darkfield microscopy), but oddly contains the fatal *universal dietary bias*, in which one diet suggestion is prescribed for all. I believe (giving credence to bloodtype/diet connections) that he mostly deals with type A's, (thick blood), in which his suggestions are more apropos. I am an O, however, and my analysis showed very good digestion on a ketogenic diet. :P Does anyone know of another similar book to this one, which would apply to an omophagist like myself?"
1,Live recording marred by persistent coughing,"Why was this particular recording of the piano concerto ever released, other than to make money? The lovely playing of this piano concerto by Emil Gilels is completely ruined by endless, chronic coughing. It sounds like the audience is either suffering from an epidemic or trying to start one. A few of the folks in attendance should have been escorted out for being so rude and inconsiderate. Hasn't enyone ever heard of cough drops and handkerchiefs - or perhaps staying home when you're sick? Both of the Argerich concert recordings have audiences that are extremely quiet - until they erupt in applause at the end. For the sheer electrity of a live performance without all the projectile phlem, I highly recommend either of those. Avoid this one like the plague."
1,Coughing ruins it,"The entire recording, and especially the second movement of the piano concerto, is marred by relentless coughing... a shame, because the performance is quite nice."
3,Problems with concert recordings,"The CD under review is a wonderful purchase in many ways, having both Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto and his Violin Concerto on the one disc. I was, as always, wonderfully impressed with Gilels' musicality, power and nuanced phrasing of the Piano Concerto. However, this recording included numerous coughs, presumably from the audience, during the second movement and I would have hoped that with modern technology such distractions could have been removed from the CD. No such blemishes affect the recording of the violin concerto which was, as might be expected with David Oistrakh, magnificent. Peter H."
3,I can hear the audience coughing,"Oistrakh's violin concerto was great. Famous piano concerto No.1, however, disappointed me because, due to the live recording, I heard the audience coughing! I wonder why SONY did not delete the noises and I wonder more why American people do not have a handkerchief when they go out. I think it is a common sense that people should put a handkerchief on the mouth when they cough in order not to bother other people, but unfortunately many American people do not know this common sense."
5,"Great camera, great price",Bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves it. Took it on vacation and she took over 300 photos. Never missed a step. Nikon is our camera od choice from now on.
4,Camera order from Cameta Camera,I cannot review the product because it was purchased as a gift. I can only review the purchasing process. I ordered a camera kit and some extras from Cameta Camera through Amazon. Everything went smoothly and the camera arrived at its destination at the estimated time.
4,Works so far but had to reverse magnet,"In order to get the magnet to activate my phone (Droid) to car mode instead of dock mode, I had to take off the soft rubbery cover to access the inner magnet and turn it over. Then I replaced the cover and went ahead to place the base magnet to my car. I like that the black, thicker phone magnet is strong but pretty slim. It seems stable enough the hold my phone over driving bumps but I haven't had it for that long. The thinner but larger metal sticker I placed on my ipod so I can navigate my music closer to eye level. Overall, pretty pleased with this purchase since it's easy to use and doesn't obstruct your driving view and it's a good price. Let's just see how it goes long term...."
3,3M double sided tape does not stick to everything.,"I am one of those people who has a dashboard that this product doesn't stick to.I have a dollar store mini glue gun, and a dollar store bag of glue sticks.I heated the glue gun, ran out of the house with it to the truck, applied the glue to the holder, and squished it on to the desired place on my dashboard. All is well, but 3 stars due to having to secure other items to make this work."
2,Doesn't stick to my car,"Just be forewarned: this doesn't seem to stick to some car dashboards. I drive a Hyandai Elantra 2001 and it wouldn't stick so it'll just be a piece of junk in the closet now. Maybe if I put some tape on the dash and then attach it to the tape it would work, but that seems awkward. I tried the sticky putty stuff and that doesn't stick to my car either."
3,First attempt failed,I had issues with the set sticking to my car. Even after following the directions step by step. My Iphone ended up getting a big scratch on the screen due to the magnetic that sticks on the dashboard falling off.I did contact the seller and got a new one that works fine after a few emails.
4,Simple and effective,"This holder works well; the magnet is quite strong. It comes with two metal stick-ons for devices; a very thin one and a heavier one. I stuck the thin one inside the back cover of my phone and the thick one on my GPS unit. Both hold firmly with no slippage going over bumps. The holder is about 1"" dia."
5,Best I'v used,Unobtrusive and reliable. The adhesive stuck well to my dash and the magnet is very strong. Suction cups are over.
5,Fast read,"Another great John Long compilation!! Read while on a business trip & could hardly put it down, really saved me from the travel boredom. Any climber can relate to the drama & excitement!"
5,The best performance I have yet heard of a piece I love.,"This is a very underappreciated work, possibly because it does not give the soloists that much chance to show off their ""licks"", but it is still a beautiful piece which does not ""talk down"" to it's listeners. The fact that Stern and Rose spent considerable time playing chamber music together shows to glorious effect here in this extremely chamber-like concerto."
4,"Decent book, typos were annoying","If you can get past every other word being ""in quotes"", and lots and lots of typos, this book has some decent information within it (mostly from quotes and exercises taken from other printed material). It's a decent book, however. It would REALLY be worth it for the author to have a professional editor look it over, however."
3,Gets you on the right road anyway...,"I read a lot of metaphysics and physics and this book is good for the reader needing a simpler view of life. The Abraham Hicks material is very compelling and empowering. If you want deeper information of the whys, whats, etc. read Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot and go from there....Abraham has a lot of cool things to say, Holographic Universe will give you the willies because of the deep truths in the book. You decide. Warm and fuzzies=Abraham info, Heebie Jeebies and Deep Deep Truth=Holographic Universe."
2,sometimes they are just plane bad,"This cat claims this freshly ploped poop is like unto the old universal horror movies.If Lagosi or Karloff or Vincent Price etc...saw this caca they would linch him,and after watching this turkey it would be a mercy killing.The only thing old Universal about it is its in black and white.The sets stink,the actors are lousey,and the script appears to have been written by one on drugs,and bad ones.If you want horror B flicks that are cheezy and fun,this is not it.it is just bad."
1,Cheap....Cheap......Cheap,Cheap and not in a good way. This thing looks like a low budget porn without the sex. Highly dissapointed. Rental only
2,"it was not bad, but not good","The story per se' was good if there would been more dialogue between the characters. I saw the graphic comic and decided to buy the book. I was not happy with the fact that there was barely any kind of conversations. The book pretty much was an explanation of the facts or what was going on around the characters. I was bored out of my mind and couldn't wait to finish it, so I can toss it between the books that are better forgotten. Marla just thought about everything, and to give a simple answer it would take two pages for her to make up her mind. This book would been great, if only had more actual conversations in it. Would not recommend it."
1,Silly nonsense,"Someone gave me a copy, and it only confirmed my suspicions about mr Grant. It is self indulgent fantasy nonsense, and has nothing to do with an actual spiritual path. It is really a waste of time. Cthulhu is a worthless concern. Why do people buy this junk? Are they that gullible?"
5,One of the great operas in English,"Yes, I am a huge fan of Stravinsky's music and I love this opera. Auden and Kallman wrote the libretto from an idea Stravinsky had from seeing some Hogarth etchings of the same name. The story is not that of the Hogarth etchings except in the broadest sweep.This version was prepared and performed under supervision by Stravinsky and Robert Craft. It is stil the standard version and is very much worth owning and hearing again and again. Don't ignore the Gardiner or the Craft recordings or the others. But I think it is good to start here and use this as the base version.The singing is very fine and moving. I hope the prejudice against neo-classicism that was rampant in the fifties, sixties, and even into the seventies, has run its course and this music can be better appreciated. This is great music and I am so glad to enjoy it and in many versions. I hope it continues to get many live performances as well. This great work deserves to be in the repertoire."
3,"Entertaining, but not classic","This book is mostly well-written and has an involving storyline, but it just doesn't have that certain something that makes a book classic. Also, I was disappointed at how the relationship between Haramis and Orogastus was portrayed; there was a lot of potential for great writing there that was never realized.I'm hoping Black Trillium will be better, as it was the original Trillium book, written by three authors."
4,nice condition,"i ordered this book and another from same vender and had to pay s&h for both. i did inquire as to why and they said it was an Amazon thing. personally i think it's wrong and sends a bad message to folks trying to save a penny. other than that, the book was in nice condition and i'll be enjoying it."
3,Poor,"I've liked the past Broken Lizard movies, but Puddle Cruiser is lacking the humor. It's not anywhere close to Super Troopers. The filming is poor quality. The movie is an attempt to cashin in on Super Troopers and Club Dead."
4,Not only is it a double firsty--its a double girly...,"I really enjoyed this movie after watching the great ""Super Troopers"", and the not-so-great ""Club Dread"". This is the first Indie the Broken Lizard comedy group produced. If you're looking for the same comedy as in ""ST"", you will be dissapointed. No weed jokes or police jokes in this movie, however I was laughing out loud for most of it. The plot is thin but consistent. The cast works great together and I love to see independant film-makers gain success.Some funny moments are when one guy is telling a girl who is interested in his buddy horrible things about him...So hilarious!Anyone who saw Super Troopers will love this, and really see the range of the cast and understand why they are praised for being superb writers."
4,Excellent Indi Comedy,"I thought this movie was great. Even though the comedy was nothing like Super Troopers, and thank god it was nothing like Club Dread, I found it enjoyable. If I had to compare it to another movie I'd say it was a lot like Clerks. The acting at times in terrible, but most of the jokes come off well and are really funny. The movie basically revolves around this guy who gets into relationship with a girl who is still dating her old boyfriend. The main character is Dante'esque in the fact that he has no spine, and is a bit of a loser. The plot is pretty strong, and believable and has a nice climatic ending. If you're not going to buy it, I highly suggest you rent it because it has one of the greatest lines ever in a movie (when one friend basically ruins anothers chances of hooking up with a girl at a bar)."
5,great starter movie,"When I found out that there was a broken lizard film we had yet to add to our collection, I ran strait to my computer and had to get it! A little slow, but funny! If you are a broken lizard fan I would highly recomend that you add this movie to the collection!"
1,Puddle Cruisers Should've been Torpedoed!!,"Let me start out by saying that I wanted to like this movie. I was, and continue to be, a big fan of ""Super Troopers"" & ""Club Dread"",(I grew up in the same neighborhood as Kevin Heffernan's cousin.), but to do anything but pan this movie is a crime against comedy, cinema, and Broken Lizard!! This movie flat-out SUCKED!!I did not know that this was, in fact, a first/college film going into it. To its credit, it LOOKS okay, but it is a steaming mess from beginning to end. The jokes, with a few exceptions, were nowhere to be found and the ones I did like could've been written better. There was absolutely NO chemistry between any of the Lizards or their supporting cast. I felt I was watching a bad Kevin Smith film(If Kevin Smith was lobotomised and electroshocked while shooting heroine)on a bad acid trip while on fire!!BOTTOM LINE: Take the $4 you'd spend renting it and see ""Super Troopers"" or ""Club Dread"" again."
1,What a disappointment,"First of all, I love Broken Lizard. My roommate and I would watch Supertroopers and Club Dread all the time. They're hilarious. So when we saw the group was releasing this movie, granted some of their earliest stuff, we were very excited. Thankfully, we used one of our free rentals at the video store because it was terrible. There were a few good moments in the movie but overall it just wasn't funny. I won't buy it."
1,I can't believe I wasted my time with this.....,"This movie is absolutley horrible. I heard it was an underground funny movie and was told it's a must watch. I think the only reason I made it through the whole thing was I kept waiting for the funny parts, next thing I know, the credits were rolling. BLEACH! Amazingly awful."
5,Better Than Super Troopers And Club Dread!,I am shocked at all the negative reviews. This movie is absolutely hilarious! There are some classic lines in this film and the film had a good story. Super Troopers was good but was too silly and Club Dread was just stupid. Puddle Cruiser was their most independent low budget movie and it works perfectly. I rented the movie and returned it then went on amazon and just bought it! Ignore all bad reviews and decide for yourself.
3,where are the cheerleaders?,Look this film is in no way the T&A; flick it looks like on the cover. I don't know where that came from. It is also NOT a Super Troopers follow up or even in the same geneIt is a NICE ROMANTIC comedy. A good date flick. If they had marketed that way it would have done well. I went to Colgate 2 years ahead of these guys and loved this film. As it was my college life. So if you were a preppy or a New England college type in the 80's or 90's. This is your movie. Buy it grab the wife watch it and get lucky like you never did in college.COLGATE DOES NOT HAVE CHEERLEADERS!
2,Not BLG's finest hour,Hate to say it but so far the worst Broken Lizard Group movie I have seen to date. Like most of their other stuff so I thought I would give this one a try. Was dissapointed. Didn't really find the movie amusing.
2,Not as great as I thought,"First of all I purchased this movie from my local CD Warehouse because it was on sale (2 for $3.99). I expected better than what I watched from the film. I wasn't able to follow the plot of the movie because they goes off about each of the five Lizards. I did think the movie was funny and I laughed through various scenes such as the one in the cafeteria where the lizards get caught, which is why I am giving the movie two stars instead of one. If you are into crude humor I slightly recommend this movie, but it definitely isn't worth spending the money buy.The only part I liked was the chemistry between the 5 Lizards, but not much else."
1,Not worth your time,"Sorry, but unless you are really into esoteric numerology you are going to be disappointed.I am honestly sorry I bought this; it is not at all my kind of book, but then, sometimes one DOES judge a book by its cover.If you really want to buy this book, or even if you think you may as well, buy it from me cheap; I'm going right now to sell this through Amazon in an effort to recuperate a few dollars of what I spent."
3,It's ok,When i got this paper i thought it would be completely different when it came down to texture but i was wrong it's basically a matte photo paper it's really not necessary to buy this paper
1,print comes out so soft and light it's a waste of paper.,I have been printing with Hahnemuehle Fine Art Paper and assumed Canon Photo Rag would be similar to that. Not. I bought 3 packages and wish I'd only gotten one. Don't think I'll be able to use it unless I want to print something with a very weird effect.
1,poor quality,"I purchased this in the hope that it would meet the standard of Canson photo paper, did not come close, if you don't really care about the quality of you photo's and just want the image printed this is ok paper, otherwise purchase Canson paper."
5,Ebc double H sintered pads,Ebc double H sintered pads work great and don't make any when braking. I got them fast at a good price.
4,Finding truth--and learning about love--from the jobsite,"Everyone has a story to tell, but not many of us can tell it like Mark Clement in his book, The Carpenter's Notebook. His main character, Brendan, is just a normal guy with today's normal problems: troubled marriage, faltering career, loss of a parent. Brendan, though, doesn't stew. He takes on a building project in memory of his father. It's a great way to sweat off his frustrations and think about where he is headed. He has no idea how much more he will learn and feel about life and living from his carpenter-father's plans and instructions. In the end, Brendan's life is enriched with knowing he is loved and that gives him the freedom to be loving. The author engages his readers so deeply that I felt a part of his struggle and ultimate mission to build a better life for him and for his family."
5,Loved It!,"I had run across this title some time ago. Finally, I picked it up! Absolutely loved it! The struggle that Brendan endures is something that any man in a relationship with his parents, wife or kids will relate to. Seeing himself through his father's eyes is also an incredible voyage of discovery. Finally the notebook parts where awesome as well. This is the first book I've every bothers to right a review for."
5,A great book,"This is just the BEST book. I always bought Richard Scarry book for my boys...now it is for my Grand-daughter, who loves it."
5,can't go wrong with Richard Scarry,It is so much fun to read books to your children that you loved as a child and to see them get as much entertainment out of as you did and the greatest part is you still enjoy it.
4,Wonderful bar chime set,"I am not a musician, but I love the sound of chimes so I ordered this set just for fun. I love these chimes! They have a beautiful sound! They are attractively constructed, and arrive in a sturdy carrying case.The only drawback - the beater that comes with the set (brass, I think) leaves marks (divots, even) on the chimes. If you order this set of chimes, consider also ordering a non-metallic beater to use instead of the one supplied."
3,Well better than only in amerika but.......,"But still lacks the potential that hed p.e. could accomplish there first album rocked! i was addicted to my first listen the second album grew to be a top favorite for many infact most people enjoy it better than the first then blackout which wasnt that bad but compared to the first 2 it felt like hell then only in amerika now what were they thinking? they probably lost many fans because of that album. Now ""Back 2 Base X"" well there definately heading back to the right roots but it just hasnt clicked all the way yet! i do like around 5 songs on the album but some of them show they still are stuck in this ""Only In Amerika"" mind set but its worth checking out if your a Hed p.e. fan!"
2,What happened to Hed pe?,"I don't know what the review above me can see I cant, but I do not like any cd post broke very much. Daze or war is a good song, but simply because it sounds more like something off BRoke. Each cd sounds more punk and less hard. Only in amerika grew on me, but this new cd is punk garbage. If you want Hed Pe, you want Broke not anything else they have offered."
2,"Oh, How The Mighty Have Fallen","Upon listening to the first song on Hed Pe's new album, my first thought was, ""What the hell? Their making elevator music now?"" By the 3rd song, i was ready to fall asleep, and turned the cd off in disgust.Hed Pe used to be on the front line of the rap metal scene. They released two good albums, their s-t debut, and ""broke"", which broke them above ground. But then, came their third album, ""black out"", and they gave into the demands of the corproate music business, and sold out. Tehy lost many fans, and since then, they have had a revolving door of musicians for every subsequent album and tour.my main question is, what the hell happened to this once great band?"
1,HED p.e. where did you go???,"i loved them when they first came out and their first few album were amazing, but then ""only in america"" came out, I'll get it 2 songs that were good, the rest sucked monkey nuts. and now this album is only loud gay noises and not enough good rythm, music and GOOD lyrics!!! the lyrics in this suck, my dog could write better lyrics. im sorry to say this but, dont waste money on this album..."
3,it is ok,"I am a HUGE HED fan, and was very much looking forward to this CD. I like about 5 songs on this album, but others feel kinda rushed and weak. This is not their best effort, but they are always interesting and try new things musically. ""Let's Ride"" is my favorite on this CD. Broke is still their masterpiece however....."
3,NOT TOO BAD.....,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE ALRIGHT. I'VE READ BETTER AND WORSE. I THINK SANDRA DID A GOOD JOB IN KEEPING THE READER CURIOUS AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ALEX AND MEGAN'S FATHER. I SAY TRY AND READ IT IT JUST MAY HOLD YOUR ATTENTION
2,Boring,This book was not interesting at all. The Prologue was better than the story itself. I may have gotten to the 7th chapter and put the book down and never picked it back up again. Definitly a weak story with weak story line.
2,Not Impressed,"I must say I was a bit disappointed by this book. I read ""Close Encounters"" in two days while it's taken nearly 3 weeks to struggle through this one. This is the 3rd book by Sandra Kitt that I've read, but none of the characters were as interesting as those in ""The Color of Love"" or ""Close Encounters"". I found the character of Dallas Oliver to be completely unsympathetic and a bit whiny. How many times does the reader need to be reminded that she's bi-racial? I only wish Dallas and Alex had the chemistry that would have made the story much more interesting."
3,An O.K. read!,"This was my second time reading Sandra Kitt's work. I truly enjoyed ""Significant Others"". ""Between Friends"" left a lot to be desired. Dallas and Valerie's relationship was not developed well. Although, I felt more acquainted with Dallas more so than Valerie. Oh well, I expected better, but I did finish it."
2,Very Disappointing,"I am a big FAN of Ms. Kitt's and anxiously awaited her new novel; however, I am disappointed with her latest. I too find the story to be unbelieveable. Her previous novel, ""Significant Others,"" is by far her best work to date. I can relate to the characters in that book and find it most entertaining and believable, so much so, that I have reread the book 5 times. Sorry Ms. Kitt but you missed the mark on this novel."
1,This book was awful,"I've never read any of Sandra Kitt's other books, but I must say that I was VERY disappointed in this one. The book had no depth to it. I thought the character Dallas was a total wimp. In every paragraph she was afraid to speak her mind about something. Hopefully, the other books by Sandra Kitt are better than this one,"
5,Friends and Lovers,"Sandra Kitt did it again with another great book. Alex and Dallas are such great characters and they're so good together. I thought it only natural that they end up together. He's been with her through some of her toughest times and he's truly the bestest friend she's ever had. Dallas helped Alex to realize his worth while Vin continued to deny him the love he always wished to receive. Valerie really pissed me off. I thought she was fake,rude,insecure, and Dallas deserved a better friend than her. All in all, from start to finish, you'll want to read more of this book."
4,Sandra's Gone and Done it Again!,"I don't know how she does it but whenever I read any of her books, I can actually SEE the action in my head like a movie; she writes THAT clearly and concisely! Plus, no matter WHO the guy is, I always manage to wind up getting a ""crush"" on that character! Yup, no doubt! Sandra Kitt IS my all-time favorite author---hands down!"
5,Great Story and beautiful characters in the story,"I enjoyed the book very much. The story is no different then what some people out here in socity have to face everyday. It show how love can conqure a lot of things if you let it. The relationship between the characters are better then reading a romance book. I love the book and I think you should read it, you might be surprise that you won't put it down. Sandra Kitt is a good writer."
3,Disappointing Book,"I normally love Sandra Kitt's work, but I couldn't get into this book. It took me a long time to read it. I felt that Dallas and Valerie's relationship was unbelievable. They didn't seem to be best friends. The other characters were like cardboard cutouts. I don't think there characters were fully drawn out. I hope that her next novel will be better."
1,WHAT A LET DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have read other Sandra Kitt books - and I was very disappointed with this one. It just seemed as though something was missing. The book moved very slow and then all of a sudden - she crammed everything into one chapter at the end. I won't say that I won't read any of her books again - because anyone can make a mistake but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
1,This book was Pitiful,This was the first book I've read by Sandra kitt. Honestly I had to skip chapters to see what she was leading up to. Which was nothing. I felt it was a waste of money.
3,Not as gripping as the other books....,"This book was good, but it lack something for me and it didn't grip me the way ""The Color of Love"" did. I felt that in this book Miss Kitt build you up to a point and stop you dead in your tracks with whatever scene you were reading about! I felt it lack the detail you needed to understand the characters a lot more and not leaving you ""assuming"" about what their all about. In all it is a good book but it could have been a lot better, but I still enjoy what she writes about."
1,don't waste your money on this item!,"It deserves a zero, but that isn't a rating option. The claim: ""This book will guide you to the top point of professional trading."" The reality is that the first part is poorly written and edited--and its just a short summary of the nuts and bolts of forex, with a plug for the author's website training program (I thought I was going to be guided the the ""top point"" of professional trading, but it looks like I'm just being guided to give more money to the author). The second part of this item was copy-written in 2002. It is essentially just another encyclopedia of technical indicators and an outline of US currency/economic history. All this information is already available for free on several Internet sites which are better written, and more informative than this book."
2,A disappointing work.,"Although I have greatly admired Ronald Hayman's earlier biographies, I found this one disappointing. It spends a lot of time summarizing Jung's essays and books, and the summaries tend to get tedious. Worse, the chapters are not well organized. The most fascinating aspect of Jung's life is not that he developed a powerful theory of archetypes but that for many years he maintained a triangular relationship with his wife Emma and his mistress Toni Wolff. All three of them were psychotherapists. But Hayman never explains how this ""menage a trois"" could survive year after year or how it affected Jung's five children; in fact, the children are rarely mentioned; and the family life so central to Jung's emotional well-being seems just a shadow in this biography. Recommended only for those interested in Jung's professional life."
1,It is suck. Save your money and don't buy it.,"ATTENTITION,ATTENTION.The toy is sucks. Don't buy it. My boy was really dissapoint with it. The warranty is suck too, because they said it will not warranty it if the boat goes in the water. The funny thing is this is a RC water boat. How they don't warranty it after goes in the water. How we will know if it will work in the water if we don't put it in the water. My boat broken at the first time it goes in the water. The boat isn't drive strait,flip by itself and water goes in at the first time we put it in the water. Save your money and don't buy it."
1,Rip-off,"Beware! This disc has only 2 songs on it. If you want Amy Winehouse, and you should, get ""Back on Back"", which has ""You Know I'm No Good"" on it, and is a definite 5."
5,Got that ol three wheeler,"My ol three wheeler is a 87' Honda 250sx,think that they are kinda rare now days!!Put this new fender on there and it fit perfect,looks shiny and new.Sanded down the oxydation on the rear fender and painted it,kinda like a ""restore"",looks great,rides great!!"
4,ease up on the message kids!,"theres been a lot of ink spilled over the accuracy of the message, and everyone here is railing its inclusion in a parallel bible, but honestly, thats why i chose this bible to buy. while the message may not be entirely accurate and shouldnt be used to argue fine points of theological brilliance, it is very helpful for breaking down complex passages and giving the scriptures a much more easy read than the typical translation. I think that it is a valuable inclusion in this bible. if you think of it less as a comparitive tool and more like a 4 in 1 bible that lets you pull scripture to fit your audience or to simply help you to better understand then the message fits right in."
5,Best Bible Ever!!,"I really love this bible! It is so cool to be able to check a passage written in four translations, all on the same page!! I used to carry my traditional bible translation (NIV study) and The Message version around all the time to compare verses (I often find the Message speaks to me at a deeper level than other translations), and it was cumbersome. Now I just use this one bible most of the time, and use my old study bible occasionally. The book is well constructed, and the font size is not as small as I thought it would be. Parallel bibles are a great idea, and this is the best one I have found."
4,A really useful book,"I appreciate the thoughness of having these parallel books together. It has complete texts, and thin paper. However, the thin paper makes reading difficult as the print from the opposite side shows through. It is a good reference, but not for lenghthy reading."
2,Nice looks but.....,"I bought several of these lights, but would not buy again. The lights come on in just about any type of wind. The controls are not easily accessible one the light is mounted. While the motion detector pivots up and down, it does not pivot left or right. Plus, after a little over a year of owning these lights, one stopped working according to specifications. No matter how I adjust the timing control, the light goes off after 10 secs or so. I called the manufacturer and they said it was a defective sensor that would need to be replaced but that they would not cover (because it was over a year old) and they could not sell me the part. I contrast this to support from a competitor's product that I had purchased several years earlier that had problems after several years. That manufacturer replaced the product free of charge. The only ask was that I send them the defective light."
4,controls motion,"The motion detector does not operate unless there is a heat soure as well, prevents wind motion activating the light"
3,Sportswriters should stick to columns,"This book is not nearly as good as the book ""And the Walls Came Tumbling Down"" by Frank Fitzpatrick, about the same subject. Ray Sanchez should stick to newspaper articles. He does not do a good job of developing characters or themes, and did not do enough research. There is no bibliography, and most of the book sounds like fan-speak. On the other hand, I am a fan so it is in my library. There are several typos in the book which detracts from it and makes it hard to take seriously. Ray Sanchez was not the reporter who covered the Miners in 1966, but was working for the paper that year and remembers the events personally. This perspective is critical to an understanding of the 1966 Miners, and is why I give the book 3 stars instead of the 2 stars it deserves based on literary merit."
4,Women Can Do It Too!,"I pruned roses for years with only one glove, and must say, with the Plantsmiths' clear instruction we can all discard the gloves. I have this recording in VHS format, and it is very clear/easy to follow. It's not a ""fancy"" recording, but takes you up close to the simplicity of pruning. Anyone can prune successfully (and bare handed) with the Plantsmiths' instruction."
2,No Stands,Selected these lamps for the style of the stands but they were not included in the product provided. Shades are a little small. Pair was smaller than expected.
4,the video is great,"the video was great they just sent us the wrong one, but i am not goinig to complain it came in a timely fashon, and we love watching it, it was the video with johnny cash his brother tommy cash and several other stars from the 70's hee haw is great regardless who is staring that week."
2,Only wine imrpoves with time,"Only wine improves with time. I got this disk to see if that old country version of Ed Sullivan, called Hee Haw, was better or worse given the vantage point of history. At its best, HH could in fact be funny, sexy, irreverent, and even fun to listen to. Plus, it did have ""a heart"", bringing the ""grand ole opry"" spirit to tv. The grand ole opry was unique in that it was the zenith of country music, yet (unlike say Carnegie Hall for classical musicians) the performers normally did not demonstrate a complete mastery of their craft...in other words, anyone could do it. But that was what was(and is) great about country music versus, say, rock.Anyway, if you want to see Hee Haw again, this disk certainly does that. It is just a piece of the giant (Hee Haw series) pie and thus is by no means the best. To pick the best would be a difficult task, but I would love to do it..."
2,"Thought it was merely used, but got a library copy :-(","The image used in the ad was NOT the item I received. I thought I purchased a used HEE HAW DVD, but instead it was a very used library copy loaded with security devices, library stickers, etc. I planned on giving it as a gift and had to make up a ridiculous excuse why it looked the way it did (I trimmed away all of the ugly labels) when I eventually gave it to its recipient. While I like the contents of the DVD, everything else was no good."
4,A most poignant look at life during civil rights movement.,I was born in 1959 and was immediately attracted to this book. I was captured by the author's style of writing. I was transported in time to live and feel what life was like for those involved in the civil rights movement. I am most impressed with the author's ability to have the reader feel the happy-go-lucky feeling of being a child yet experiencing the fear of death and judgement. This book is the best I have read this year. Members of my book club will enjoy it also.
3,Function is good but expensive for small plastic lights,"These lights are about the size of a hockey puck. One light would easily light up 2 ft of counter. I recessed mine so I didn't use the housing for doing surface mount. CMT makes a $30 68mm Forstner bit but if you're good with a jig saw, you probably can do without it to drill the hole for recessed applications. I bought black and stainless steel finish. The transformer is silent and I'm am satisfied with the way they look and work. I'm disappointed for the price I just got painted plastic lights. Doesn't seem like I got much for my money. However, I couldn't find any comparable alternates."
5,This Was AWESOME!,"I wish this could happen to me! A guy gets in a car wreck and ends up in a fantasy world where all the skills he needs to survive are supplied by God. He meets a pretty girl who helps him with his quest and has a bunch of adventures with a talking rabbit. Then he wakes up and finds out that the girl is real! This book is great for kids and older folks too, and I'd also reccomend the sequels"
5,This Book was awesome!,"I wish this could happen to me! This guy gets in a car wreck(don't worry, he's okay) and wakes up in a great fantasy world, outfitted by God with all the skills he'll need to survive. He meets a beutiful girl who helps him with what he's supposed to do there, has a great adventure with a talking rabbit, and wakes up to find that the girl's real! This is a great fantasy book for kids and older folks as well, and I'd reccomend the sequels too"
2,Not for the average bride,"This book, written by the owner of a web design firm and a professional writer, is clearly slanted toward the older bride who lives in or near a metropolitan area and who has a large wedding budget. If you live in a mid-sized city or a small town, you won't find most of the ideas of much value. As an event planner located in a mid-sized city, my clients provide more down-to-earth and affordable ideas than those found in this book. Save your money and purchase a more practical book."
2,not worth it,"yeah, there are a offbeat ideas here but nothing i hadn't heard before and it's still all fluff - nothing practical. i was expecting a guide that would help me cope with other people's expectations so I could do it my own way and help me remember what the ceremony is about instead of just the cookie cutter martha stewart event that weddings i have been to seem to have become.this just added to the pile of garbage to me - turn your wedding into a theme party! a bbq picnic or a 1940s swing night! - just more gimicky stuff that for me takes away from the fact that it's a wedding - something joyful and life changing is happneing.nothing very practical or thought provoking - instead of scouring books, scour your own imagination for ideas."
4,Terrific Book for the Unique Bride,"The title is the key. Anti-Bride doesn't mean you are against marriage. However, it means you aren't looking to do everything in a traditional style.It gives ideas on ways to approach the wedding that are unique. It discusses different couples approaches to their wedding ranging from theme weddings to casual settings. It is all about making your wedding meaningful to you.I believe the book could use to be longer and more indepth. And note, this isn't a how-to book. It is about creating the wedding you want."
2,Definitely NOT anti-bride,"I thought this might offer me some unique ideas, but this is really a fairly traditional bridal book dressed up in hip clothing. There are better sources out there."
2,Not Anti Bride,"This would not be a bad wedding guide if it didn't claim to be different. It is, generally, about the same as the others I've read. The most ""anti"" theme is the book is that you don't have to do what your family wants you to. But, there is plenty of discussion of etiquette, what to do, what not to do, etc. Sure there are a few nice ideas, but all bridal guides tend to have a few nice ideas. I was looking for a book that could really assist me in having a wedding that is *different.* I wanted something to help me get past all that brainwashing about what a wedding looks like. This book, instead, offers slightly alternative-ish ideas about how you might adjust existing traditions and how you don't have to listen to all your family. Not a bad wedding book, but just doesn't live up to being anything that different from what is already out there."
3,Not so Anti-,"I should have heeded the other reviewers before I bought this book because it really is much too traditional for the kind of wedding I'm planning. I would call this book a guide about cutting corners (ie, planning on a budget) or advice on veering from only the very traditional. I suppose a book like this is difficult to write, as those of us planning more ""modern"" weddings only have to use a bit of creativity to get what we're after. I found the wedding websites much more useful and up-to-date in this department.That said, I did get the Anti-Bride Wedding Planner for my future sister-in-law, who despite planning a very traditional, formal wedding, considers herself an anti-bride at heart!"
1,Some tidbits...but decidedly not for the anti-bride,"I was very disappointed with this book. As a traditional wedding guide, it's not bad - filled with the basics of wedding planning: cutting down your guest list, gown shopping, reception options, etc all wrapped up in a fun little guide. However, as an anti-bride wedding resource? Not so much. While the book toted the mantra of ""it's ok to be different,"" it didn't offer much of substance. Other than explaining that not all bridesmaids are wearing the same dress these days (*gasp!), that brides...sometimes wear dresses other than traditional white (*holy cow*!), and you can get married...in a park (*Crazy talk!*). The wedding planning section was thrown in as an afterthought (assuming you'd spend the big bucks for its sister book, called the Anti-bride planner).If you're looking for off-the-beaten-path ideas for your wedding, move along. There's nothing to see here."
2,Not Really Useful if You're Much Past College Graduation,"This might be useful for the under 25 year old, first time around, type brides. If you're old enough not to need advice along the lines of ""you don't have to conform to anyone's expectations"" (e.g. the alleged target market for the book in the first place), you may not find it very useful. I didn't find any radically innovative or creative ideas that would be appropriate for the over 30 year old bride (Really, a glue gun and some beads??!)."
1,Not Unique in the Least,"I was hoping for suggestions and ideas about how to have an anti-wedding, but this book only has ideas for traditional weddings, complete with the big white poofy dress. I read it all the way through, hoping for it to eventually reveal the ""anti"" part of it, but it never did. Furthermore, it had several typos and most of the resources in the appendix were outdated and useless."
3,Where does the anti-bride come in?,I didn't really see how this differed from any of the other wedding books out there. I still felt as though I needed to have a lot of money/resources in order to have a fabulous day.The book doesn't really help you think outside the box.
1,don't bother,"i bought this book and am returning it. a waste of money. nothing helpful or with original ideas. i am a younge hip creative person and i found this book to be useless. the few ""non"" traditional ideas the book gave any person with half a brain can think up on their own. i am having an untraditional wedding and i really got nothing from this book. dont waste your money!"
1,very mainstream,"I had higher hopes for this book but I found it very mainstream. You may get a pep talk for why you don't have to do everything your mother wants, but there is not much advice for someone who wants to escape the traditional wedding culture and be truly original -- there are still lots of white cakes and dresses."
3,twenty something and low cost gift item,"This is a cute book for a gift when your crazy friend says she wants to get married in some new and different way. It was made for the young, hip and trendy crowd not the creative and over 35 crowd. This is basic introduction to the different parts of wedding planning and is not created to be a planning guide. Take it for what it is- urban, cute, and well marketed. This is worth getting on sale but we hesitate to pay full price. Very appropriate as a cute trinket-book for a friend that just told you her partner popped the question.RICH CHICKS specializes in media that is purchased by women. We read hundreds of books every year and are serious about or recommendations. We review books that are of interest to our female demographic. We do not get a kick-back or commission for our reviews so they are left as an impartial judge. We have left many book reviews all over this site."
5,"Finally, a wedding book for the rest of us!","I just got this and can't put it down! You girls rock! This is a fantastic book that offers straight talk about Do It Yourself Weddings that must have Vera Wang busting at the seams, and Martha Stewart confessing her sins. What can I say, this is a must read!!!"
2,"get ""how to have the wedding you want"" instead!","i should have trusted the ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" thing - this book, as other reviewers said, is not all that anti-bride and really low on useful information or ideas. claro's ""how to have the wedding you want"" is a much better book, despite it's stupid cover. i bought a basic knot planner at a used book store, cut it up and punched holes in it, and put that in a binder with all my ideas, receipts, etc. - a much better and cheaper way to organize!hey, and congrats."
1,"Talks a big game, but typical wedding book","The idea of this book is great, the execution is not. This book is a pretty typical wedding planning book, with a few nontraditional ideas here and there. What I wanted from this book are real tips for people who have not been obsessed with their wedding since elementary school, but it did not deliver. In my opinion, anti-brides do not register at Tiffany's and do not wear couture bridal gowns. I'll stick with Bridal Bargains which is a great book for those who are not obsessed."
2,Not much different than all the other bridal books,"I bought a slew of books when trying to plan my wedding in 8 weeks. This is the one I referred to the least. It is thin on any REAL information- how much can I expect to spend on flowers or a band? What are some wordings for vows, invitations? Look elsewhere for specifics. This book has some very general suggestions...none of which went much beyond what any creative gal could come up with on her own."
1,Mapopolis Crashed my Zire 71!,It made my Zire unstable and I had to do a complete reset after removing the offending software. Some of the addresses could not be found. Save your money and get Street Finder instead!
4,For true Nick addicts,"My 7 year old son got this for Christmas. He loves it! My husband and I play the game with him, and lose badly. I would imaagine, for a group of kids, this would be a pretty fun game."
4,Very disappointed,"I bought this game for my 3 year old daughter because she loves playing the Stanley games...We were very disappointed with this game. It's too structured. She can't just go to the game she wants to play. She must complete them in a specific order. Also, if she makes a mistake on a game, instead of asking her to correct her mistake, it makes her start the game over -- very frustrating! The only thing she liked was printing coloring pictures from the Great Big Book of Everything and even that was disappointing as it did not provide pictures for every letter of the alphabet. I found the games very simplistic with no way to increase the skill level. Even if she liked it, she would have outgrown it very quickly. The games on the website are so much better and they are free!However, Disney will give you a refund within 90 days if you are not satisfied and that is what I plan to do."
1,overdone,"wow, some of these other reviews are really funny. probably written by a bunch of goth (not regular goth, but REAL goth) nerds who can't manage to part with their emotional baggage. this release is awful. i think it's a concept album. what a concept; he reads verses from the bible in a spooky whisper. whoop-tee-do. when he's not doing that he's attempting 80's new wave and saying LA LA LA way too often. on the last track he attempts some lame psuedo-buddist thing. it doesn't work. what's worst about this release though, is the dude's voice. he is completely pretentious. i don't think i've ever heard anyone milk a british accent more than this guy. what's worse is that he's not even religious. he just does it for effect. overall this guy thinks way too much of himself. current 93 should go back to being an experimental tape loop band, coz lyrically and vocally, there is nothing happening."
4,NOT INDESTRUCTABLE,The video Now Jr has been GREAT for car trips and when I need to occupy my toddler while shopping and etc-BUT it is not 'virtually indestructable' as I keep reading everywhere. We've bought two. The first started sort of shorting out after about 5 months. We bought a second and left in the car overnight on a cool night (40's) and now there is sound but no video. We'll probably even buy another because it makes travel so much easier but ignore the 'indestructable' part. It is sturdy enough that it won't break when dropped from the height of a toddler...that is the extent of 'abuse' it will take.
1,"Looks cute, but a piece of junk...","I bought this for my son's birthday, because it looked like the ""perfect toy"" for a child his age. He opened it, and when we put in the batteries and pressed ""Play"", there was no sound. We tried another disc, then another, but still no change. We even changed batteries three different times, but no sound whatsoever. I think I made a big mistake buying this toy. I'm glad others have had good experiences with it, but the only ""good experience"" that I would like would be to get a full refund for this piece of junk! BEWARE!!!"
4,Cheesy but helpful,"This was a tad cheesy and you get 2 cd's, both with the same words but one has music behind it. I was hoping for $20 to have two different types of cd's. But, highly effective and great message."
2,I could not stop laughing!,"I bought this cd when I saw all the 5 star reviews but honestly I do not know how people can listen to it. When she started with that voice I just started laughing. Just imagine the old vampire saying: ""I Vannnt tooo suckkk yoooour blooood!!!"" and that is what it sounded like to me. OMG I laugh just thinking about it. The part that is not funny is that I cannot return it because it has been opened. I wish I could have listened to it before I bought it. I let two other people listen to it without giving them my opinion of it and they laughed too so I know it's not just me!! If you are thinking of buying it, please try to borrow one and listen before you buy it!"
2,Not Great for visualization,"I also bought this for the 5 star rating...but it is no 5 star product. Her voice is irritating, it starts out with an ok flow, then just gets stupid and hard to visualize."
5,AWESOME!,These pizza scissors are AWESOME! We love them so much we purchased another pair for friends. They got such a kick out of them. Highly recommend in place of traditional pizza wheel.
5,Very useful,"These will divvy and serve your pizza easily. I find them easier to use than a wheel, and I don't have to switch back and forth between the wheel and a spatula."
2,Repeating other publications,"I bought 2 other books on selecting a family dog and this book is a copy of one of them. There is some other info but if you buy it on its own it might be OK, just don't buy the 3 books together. In the Breed selection it is a exact replica of one of the other books."
3,ratt,solo album from RATT and old whitesnake guitarist. this album is sounds like moderm rock.warren make vocals his voice is sounds like layne stanley from alice in chains this album is good
1,Doesn't fit standard Ticonderoga #2 pencils,"If I had known that these wouldn't fit standard #2 pencils, I wouldn't have purchased these. Also the stickers peel off very easily from the front. Not a good product."
5,Sweet chinese,This book I would recommend to any who are interested in learning chinese medicine. It is translated very well and broken down to where the reader can understand and practice with ease.
4,I wish it was bigger.,"This is a nice toy organizer. However, I wish it was a little bigger. I guess, it'll work for everyday use: just something to keep in your car for your kid's toys, snacks, etc. Unfortunately, it's too small for long trips. In my opinion, this tote is a little overpriced for its small size."
3,Small!,"All I have to say about this tote is that I really, really believed it was bigger!! I was very surprised when I first saw it. Otherwise it is a cute car organizer... had it been bigger, it would have been perf!"
1,misleading,"it was not what wanted the discription was not clear. they would have taken it back , but would have more than impay for it too ship it back."
3,A few anachronisms,"The Dave Brubeck music tracks backing the action were recorded long after 1953 when this film was set, as any jazz fan will immediately notice. And the street light poles are circa 1970s. Still, there's something warmly effective about this NYC period piece, even if Shelly Winters gets on your nerves as the Jewish mother. It's fun seeing 1976 New York set-dressed to look 20 years younger. The Caffe Reggio hasn't changed, though, even today. A little dated, overall, but worth the watch, as any Mazursky film usually is."
3,Good book.,"Some information can be considered obsolete, but this book stands as an inspiring amount of pictures. The second section, with the different aquarium styles, shows a lot of ideas you can use to arrange decoration, and let you know about a lot of materials that can be used in each style/biotipe."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Given the glowing reviews I read on this site, I was somewhat disappointed with the book when it finally arrived. The general information is fine, as far as it goes, if on a rather basic level. I guess what annoyed me most was that the author makes only a half-hearted effort to use plants indigenous to the various biotopes he describes--for example, Anubias, an African genus, finds its way into the Amazon acid pool. Also, the lists of appropriate fishes are fairly sketchy. And maybe I'm alone in this, but I found it odd that none of the finished biotope aquaria are photographed with fish in them!What I was hoping for was information on a par with that provided on the Italian website www.natureaquarium.it; this book, while pleasant enough, doesn't begin to reach that level of sophistication or specificity."
4,"Good, but could be better","Overall, this is a good book. It has impressive pictures of the aquariums as a finished product and plenty of info on how to make them look natural. The problem is, as several stated earlier, it is not always accurate. African plants are used in S. American setups, plants that can't tolerate any salt for an extended period of time are used in brackish setups. If you don't mind these inaccuracies, you can get plenty of ideas for your own aquariums. Amano's Nature Aquarium World books would probably be better for inspiration, but it's not a bad read overall."
5,Bugs Bugs Bugs is wonderful,I bought the book for my granddaughter who loves bugs.She loves the book and has her mom read it to her everyday.
4,"vibrant beautiful illustrations, son never asks for it","this has really beautiful illustrations and I chose it to buy a bug book. My son loves to ""read"" or be read to, but never asks for this. maybe in time he will develop an interest in insects, but for now, it is pretty much untouched."
5,Great bug book,"We bought this book for my two year old, as Fish Wish was his favorite and we like the author's style. Another wonderful and colorful / informative book. It was especially great as an introduction to summer."
3,It's soso,"I got this for the toddler class. The pictures should keep there attention, I hope. I will try reading it to the 2 & 3 year-olds too."
1,Cheat,The Kindle special-deal price was $1.99; the book looked cute; I tried it. I got NINE of 32 pages. Pass on this one.
3,Favre Jersey,Good quality product and arrived on time. Fit was correct and an authentic NFL jersey. Advertisement and reality met.
5,Love this product,Ive had one of these for over 25 years. It finially corroded because of the socket it was in and the light was no longer used. It had come in very handy when my husband was ill and had to have medication delivered to my home. All I had to do was tell them to look for the blinking light.
4,Awesome!!!,This is a great band with their own unique sound.....LUV the vampire references!!! First heard Blah Blah Blah by them on youtube and i just needed to have their cd....
4,Good Stuff,"I really like Impeccable Blahs. I was late to the Say Hi party (I discovered them in 2007), but this CD actually holds up pretty well even though I didn't hear it when it came out. The vampire theme is slightly cheesy, but they somehow pull it off in a compelling way without coming off as being pretentious. There are also some strange references to Buffy The Vampire Slayer that I thought were amusing (e.g. Angels and Darlas).The basic sound of this CD is layered synths and distorted guitar. Most of the songs are repetitive and centered around catchy pop riffs. The hooks and the general sound remind me of 70s music (I can see the Ziggy Stardust Bowie reference in the description)."
4,Great CD,"Thanks to this CD I listen to/enjoy music again. However I gave it 4 stars because I can't stand ""Snowcones and Puppies""."
5,"Bobby D., Bad Boy and TKC are Awesome!!!!","If you are a fan of Chicago Hard House then this CD is a must have. Bobby D. and Bad Boy Bill are my favorits on this CD. To Kool Chris is also really good. I like how he spins some old school rap and disco in with hard house. Brian Middleton also spins some pretty good house, but I like his mix in Vol. 5 better. If you like progressive house then you'll definalty like DJ Markski. I'm not a big fan of Tim ""Spinnin"" Something or Other, but if like house that's more laid back you might like him. All in All there is a little something on here for everyone who is a fan of house music."
5,K&N Quality,"As always, not disappointed with the quality of K&N filters. These last longer than you car will last with simple maintenance at every few oil changes. Well worth the investment."
3,AT&T Sucks,"I ordered this phone from the AT&T website, not Amazon.com. The phone itself is awesome, but I cannot get a signal inside my office building. I use this phone primarily for emergencies only (my father has been ill for some time), but since I cannot get a signal, that really defeats the purpose. AT&T is terrible, their customer service is frustrating, more than once I have had to call 4-5 different numbers and have been shuffled from one department to another. If you get this phone get it from some one else. IMHO AT&T has gotten too big to care about the average consumer."
4,nice phone,i have has the attws gsm service for over 1 year now and this nokia is the best i have found. the phone is solid. holds the signal where other phones would not. i used the s46 and t/720 and this works great with attws. the keyboard is nice only complaint is the backlite can not be controlled
2,"Good phone, TERRIBLE SERVICE","This phone in itself has some pretty useful features - like the fold out keyboard, organizer, pop email and web access - but the service from at&t renders all these perks either unusable or terribly expensive.I cannot get a signal at my apartment, my mother's house, my girlfriends house, my best friends house, the corner store, the lower level of most shopping malls, the office, the gym, or most anyplace else with a roof. And if you use text messaging, you need to keep it under 300 a month (and get the additional text package for $10 a month, or get ready to pay. Also the web access is VERY EXPENSIVE @ .03PER KB!!!!WOULD RECOMMEND ONLY IF INTO GADGETS, OR IF YOU TEXT MODERATELY, OR IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT SERVICE (CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS TOO)."
2,Front panel and arms split after 1yr,"Great concept, I was completely enthralled in the beginning. Then, fine cracks began to appear on the arms, due no doubt to the click lock mechansim always bending them a little. Then, where the contact pins press against the front flip, a crack appeared on the main casing and one on the flip, going right to the first key. Numeric keys stopped working reliably.I found several similar reports, so I assumed Nokia knew about it.Sent it back, just 12 days out of guarantee. This is clearly a design fault, not abuse. Nokia were not interested, out of guarantee is out of guarantee, period. Am deeply disappointed.Next phone will be the Motorola A630. Never a Nokia."
2,only half of order,didn't get all of my order but the tooth brush seems to be o kay for now end of story
5,Ormandy Still Shines,"Make no mistake. This CD is about the difficult to find Ormandy rendition of the 1812 Overture. It is the gold standard to which all others must compare. Be careful, there are at least two Ormandy renditions out there. This is the one!Battleship cannon fire and the Morman Tabernacle chorus are balanced with Ormandy's famous Philadelphia Orchestra string section to create a soul-stirring 17 minutes. Ormandy takes his time and lets the music blossom as it should.Too bad the disc version could not have cleaned up the hiss sounds a bit better. Hiss or no, it still deserves 5 stars!"
3,Driving a Cadillac on tranquilizers,"David Hurwitz may think this recording is like meeting an old friend, but I lived thorugh the Ormandy era, and to me this CD is like remembering an old nap. Ormandy readings are reliable, shapeless, without imaginaiton or even the desire for imaginaiton. They just sit there, and meanwhile his glorious orchestra--at least Ormandy had that to his credit--made Cadillac sounds for a driver on tranquilizers. I guess the other reviewers here are enamored of the sounds and don't care that Tchaikovsky is a much more vital, incisive, and even wilder composer than Ormandy registers."
5,Fabulous and spacious,The best lunch back ever. Well worth the extra bucks. I take it everywhere! Much more spacious than pictured.
2,"""insert CD"" problem","I was excited that BG2:ToB was finally released for the Mac, and I rushed to order a copy. However, after installing it and trying to play, I keep getting messages ""Please insert CD ..."". When I insert the requested CD, the computer reads it and then kicks it out, repeating the ""Please insert CD ..."" message. It's not a problem with unreadable discs. Even if I insert the correct CD before starting the game -- so that it clearly appears on the desktop -- the game kicks it out and asks me to insert it. I've emailed MacPlay support about it, but no word back.Altogether, I'm disappointed after being so excited -- and I just want to warn other Mac users that there may be a problem (and if anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know!)."
4,Cute bath set,they tub island farm is very cute and good to use in the pool too. Just be careful to get all the water out of the animals or there will be mold.
2,"This handle is NOT 4""","I was looking for a new handle that was slightly larger than the one I was already using for my reloading press. This seemed ideal since it is advertised as being 4"" long.Unfortunately, the handle itself is only 3"" long. The overall length of the product is 3.75"" - including threads.The quality is excellent, with a nice solid feel and the handle rotates independent from the threads. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the quality.If you're looking for a 3"" handle, then this one is excellent. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a 4"" handle like this one claims to be - steer clear and look for something else."
4,Easy to Use,This makes cutting flying geese very easy. Can also be used for many other patterns.but I wish it had a non slip side.
1,Don't buy any Pet Alien stuff!,I'm reviewing Pet Alein DVDs you know why because Pet Alein SUCKS!!!It's one of the worst shows ever next to The Rugrats.I only watched half an epoisod and Damn was it boring.You see people Pet Alein sucks don't waste your money on a show thats off the air.
1,Inappropriate for Age Group,"The book description claims this is for ages 4-8. Really??? Yellow is for bomb detonation equipment. I want this for my 4-year-old???? Not ""yellow is the glow of Jerusalem's stone buildings when they gleam in the light of the moon."" Not ""yellow is the throat of the bulbul birds when they arrive for the winter."" Yellow is for bomb equipment. This book went back to Amazon."
5,Good intro/ recommended,"I must have read a different book than the previous reviewer, who seems to find something anti-Israel under every rock. As one who visits friends and family in Israel each year and closely follows the news, I found this book to be quite good. Further, my kids, who speak Hebrew, like it and it's helped prepare them for an upcoming family visit to Israel. Moslems and Christians and Jews, like myself, believe different things. But we all do share a passion for the sacred Land of Israel. I have strong, strong positive feelings about the Jewish claim. I always look for good ways to explain to kids this very complex situation. I think this book is a good one. I recommend fellow educators look at it for themselves and decide. I'll buy it, and won't be afraid of explaining to my kids that even though some people do mean things to our relatives in Israel, that our job is to defend ourselves while not hating them."
1,Totally dissatisfied!,"Armrest was shaky and one footrest resumes to recline. Remains at 90 degree angle, while the other functions normally. Shipper did not indicate that it would come in two parts. Not what was described. Supposed to come assembled. Not happy at all!"
5,A Case for Nuclear-Generated Electricity ...or why I think nuclear power is cool and why it is important that you think so too,Excellent book. Everyone should read it. It was just about the best book on the subject I've encountered since I was in school.
4,Three Gospels Revisited,"I read this book fifteen years ago, because I love Reynolds Price's work and because I have an interest in the new testament. I found it stood up well to time. It's a well researched and beautifully written book. I had given my original copy to a friend and was glad I bought another copy."
2,Super Outdated for Today's Market...,"The author's stories were interesting but all of his transactions were done over 20 and 30 years ago. It's very difficult to use the same ""real life"" strategies of deals done so long ago because the market is so different. There are different types of loans, creative financing, and strategies to go about getting property, even with no cash and no credit of your own.I don't recommend getting this book if you're looking for real life examples in today's market and not a million years ago."
2,Good Silly Fun,"Want suggestions of ""rapper names"" like Lil Bow Wow, or ""nature names"" like Salmon? This is the place."
2,Not the best,"This book did have some ""interesting"" ideas but it wasn't a very big book so your chances of finding a name that you really like are pretty slim. Especially since a lot of the ideas are totally weird names from video games, celebrity baby names, movies, and even a section with ""Grandpa"" names for little girls...what? Well, if you're looking for a really uncommon or unusual name, go for it, but I recommend also getting a name book with a lot more choices."
2,What-ever,This book doesn't have anything unheard of. It has some lame make you own name ideas. Like instead of Anthony it's Anfrony. Lame.
3,Index makes me want to cry,"I was happy that this book came out right before my first was born. The authors' other book, Beyond Jason and Jennifer... was extremely helpful. This book delivered as an updated resource for name ideas and trends. But, the index is impossible to work with. If you already have names that you are interested in and want to see what categories they fall into, Cool Names' index will frustrate you. For example, there is no single listing for Eliza. The reader is forced to look up Eli, Elizabeth, etc. Painful!"
2,Not cool at all,"I was a little skeptical about finding a ""cool"" name in a book called ""Cool Names"", and I was right to be. I know cool is a matter of opinion, but most of the names in this book are simply ridiculous-- is anyone actually going to name their child Salmon or Experience? This slim book appears to be random lists of words that the authors have grouped into categories like ""Spiritual Names"" or ""Artist Names"". If you are looking for a unique name I suggest The Baby Name Wizard, which will tell you about the popularity of a name, if it rising or declining in popularity and identify any pop culture references you may overlook (for example, that you are naming your child after a fish!)"
2,Maybe a little too cool,"As a writer I like browsing through baby naming books for help naming my characters. I liked that this book was small and divided up into interesting chapters, but the suggestions were ridiculous. For example: Arley for a girl. Artemis for a boy (this is another name for the goddess Diana; don't let the series ""Artemis Fowl"" fool you). And then they say that Ruby is very cool. This book is only for people who want a good laugh or want help naming sci-fi/fantasy characters, not real people."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"I had never heard of Scotty Smith and have never bought any of Steven's music. I have no idea why I even bought this book! But, I soon found out that the lessons Steven and Scotty have learned, the intimacy they have with God, the seasons of doubt they've experienced, and the freedom in God they've developed are for all of us. I have more of a sense of obedience to God, appreciation for his never ending grace and a healthy sense of His awesome holiness, than I ever had before. I want to walk closer, listen harder and love my Lord greater than I ever have before - and I can. It's hard to verbalize what I gained from this book, but I have internalized it and it is a tremendous blessing to have the help of these two Godly men who speak so freely and openly to us from their heart. I'm grateful for their struggles and their victories and even more grateful that they love us enough to transparently share it."
1,I learned more about SCC but not much else.,"I originally bought the book because of SCC. The book actually taught me alot more about SCC that I thought it would, that was the good part. After reading all the parts that SCC wrote, I decided to take a look at the whole book. In all honesty, I was kind of disturbed at how ""loosely"" Scotty holds God's grace. I know we are saved by God's grace alone and that our righteousness is as filthy rags before God, but his description of God's grace seems to nullify sin. He makes it seem as though Christ actually killed sin on the cross, therefore we can pretty much do what we want and it won't be counted unto us as sin. It seems more like a book on making people feel better about their sinful state rather than using the Spirit of God to overcome it. We may be in a sinful world but we can live above it."
1,I learned more than I wanted too.,"I am a big fan of SCC, so of course I'm going to buy this book. Though the sections that SCC wrote were very good, I found the sections that Scotty Smith wrote rather disturbing. I agree with the guy just below me from Glendale, AZ. Scotty holds the grace of God far too loosely. He seems to feel that the death of Jesus gave us a license to sin rather than the grace and mercy to overcome it. I was rather disappointed with this book and I hope that SCC doesn't fully feel the same way about God's grace as Scotty does."
5,A Classic for all faith-filled homes,"My 9-yr old daughter and I fell in love with Millie and her family from the first chapter. This is a story of a strong family whose faith carries them through a number of life changing experiences. But more importantly, it is a story of an adolescent girl who relies heavily on her faith to guide her in her decision making regarding friends and family. It is set in the late 1800's where a well-heeled family must move to a rural setting out west without many of the amenities they have become accustomed to. Charity, understanding, and standing up for one's beliefs are all stressed in this charming story that leaves you looking forward to the next book. I rank this with our other favorites: Anne of Green Gables, The Little Princess, Heidi, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Pollyanna. I only wish there were more series like it. However, it is definitely a book for children who either know, or want to know, that they are children of God."
3,book order,"This book came in very good time. It had quite a crack/break in the cover, which I don't remember reading about in the review, but I could have overlooked it."
3,Not Our Usual Maggie,"This was the first Maggie Osborne book that I found disappointing. It took me until half-way through the book to get interested in it, but once it took off it was a fairly good story.Normally her characters are so vibrant, either good or bad, but this one was neary predictable which is unusual for Ms Osborne's work.I have read nearly all of her work, and am currently reading ""Bride of Willow Creek"" which is clever, amusing, and has held my interest from page one, as have all the rest of her work.Still, it is amazing that she can write so many different situations and keep her people interesting."
2,"Dull, no spark, not her best work","I've enjoyed many of Maggie Osborne's books, but she can be an unpredictable read. Some of her stories are very entertaining (""I Do, I Do, I Do"" for example), and others just don't have much charisma. ""Shotgun Wedding"" is almost boring. It has some historical insight on the real ramifications an unwed pregnant mother might face, but as another reviewer said, Osborne never establishes the timeline. You never know what year the story is set in. There is no chemistry, really, between the two main characters. It's just not a compelling read."
1,"Oh, how disappointing...","I have been waiting for another good book from Maggie Osborne, and it's just not coming. I didn't enjoy her 2 previous books and I simply could not even finish this one. There's isn't anything to like about this couple and the heroine is so confusing....is she independant?...is she a spinster?...is she in love with this bank robber? And the darn bank robber had more time on the page than the main characters. There's no romance, no desire, no spark between anyone in this book AT ALL.Oh and can someone tell me why it's being called a great western? Is it because the sheriff rides a horse? There is no reference to a time period in this story and Maggie Osborne's unique style of research is completely non-existent. What a disappointment."
2,A bit disappointed...,"I had read other books by Maggie Osborne and was looking forward to another good read. Unfortunately, this novel falls short. Annie Malloy comes across as a spineless twit who makes one wrong choice after another. What does Jake see in her anyway? He is a strong character, but aside from his infatuation with her red hair and the way she acts ""different"" from other women, Osborne does not really develop a good romance between the two characters. Annie does nothing to build a relationship with the husband who saved her reputation from ruin. She basically put everyone's lives in danger and they all forgive her for it. I was actually hoping that Jake would come to his senses and leave her!"
5,Delightful,A good price on the two bundled DVDs. Shaun and Wallace and Gromit are delightful and recommeded for any age viewer.
5,Everyone in the family loves it!,"We first saw Shaun the Sheep on Disney and our son (one year old at the time) loved it so much we bought the DVD set from Amazon UK and a Region Free DVD player just so he could watch it. He's almost 2 1/2 now and still loves it. He recently started watching Wallace and Gromit and loves the trio of shows and the were-rabbit movie, too!"
5,Shaun lover's rejoice!,"For all lover's of Shaun, this is the best collection to purchase. ""Off the BAA"" is a collection of Shaun and his farm friends up to hijinx and mayhem. From an escape from the farm to get out of being sheared to a hilarious soccer game. For over 15 years, I've been waiting to have another Shaun adventure, and this was a bonanza.The other DVD is a trio of Gromit and his hapless owner Wallace. A trip to the moon for cheese, a criminal mastermind of a penguin and finally our first introduction of my personal hero....Shaun, who has been kiddnaped by ruthless sheep shearers. Laugh and root for the good guys!!!"
4,Health Behavior and Health Education,"This book is a must have for anyone in the health education field. It presents all major health behavior theories in a clear and understandable manner, applies theories to case studies at the end of each chapter, and offers a table summary of each theory's core constructs. The book is well written and with this third edition comes more updated research information."
4,No bad burn yet,"I have an older burner and 650mb CDRs are getting to be tough to find. These seem a decent price, and I haven't had a bad burn off one, so what can I say?"
2,Shoulda got a hundred,"After receiving these, I found that for only a few dollars more you can get one hundred disks. Look into the hundred packs before ordering."
2,Not well built,"I bought this with the anticipation that it would look nice and enable me to have a computer in with my stereo components. My biggest dissapointment is the quality of the case. The case has a recessed door on the left side that allows you to stick your fingers into it to pull the front panel off. You need to do this to install the optical drives. Every time one does this it knocks the door off it's pivot which is a thin piece of metal that puts pressure on the door. After about 5-6 times of putting the door back the pivot fatigues and fails, making it impossible to hang the door. The power button would constantly stick when you press on it. Finally the design is such that it heats up quickly. The main power supply fan is on the opposite side of the CPU. Twice I have written the company about this with emails and there is no response. Not a very well thought out unit but expensive with horrible support and a RMA that doesn't seem to warantee the cabinet at all."
4,First Female CEO on the Board.,"I enjoyed this book for one reason. I learned some history! I hated history in school and did not pay attention. This book centre's on a subject I love ""Chess"" and does a good job on covering the history of the Queen. I have not verified Ms. Yalom's research in-depth but what I have confirms her conclusions. Ms. Yalom discuss the replacement of the Vizier on the original board to a minor, weak piece to how she became the piece she is today. Yalom uses historical Queens, including Eleanor of Aquitaine, Queen Isabella, Catherine de' Medici, and Elizabeth I to show how they might have influenced the ""Queen's evolution. I especially enjoyed the color pictures of the surviving pieces, showing the detail and artistry.If you are a Chess-Nut, enjoy learning, and not afraid of a female CEO then you will probably enjoy this book."
3,Do not buy the Kindle edition.,"For all the pluses and minuses of the book (and there are many) whether you like the book or not, in the end, comes down to your views on history in general and the various roles of women in history. As someone with an interest in Social History, I was predisposed to liking the book.The reason I warn not to buy the Kindle edition of the book is that it does not include any of the illustrations. I returned my copy to Amazon and purchased a paper copy of the book so that I could see the pictures."
3,Girl's rule is the idea,"This is a book writen from a girls point of view of coarse. This will have no value for you if you play chess and want to improve your game. It shows how girls become stronger in our society using chess as the theme. The Queen is chess is the most powerful piece but when chess was in its early stages many, many years ago the queen was the weakest piece. Every girl should own this book."
2,Bridge Cards,"While the cards are very pretty and artistic, it is very difficult to see the numbers and to distinguish hearts from diamonds because the pattern is on both sides of the card and the print is in red. There is not enough contrast to see in less than optimal light."
2,Green Water Deodorent,"This is a good produce . . trouble is, there isn't much of it. It seems almost empty when new!"
3,Not what I expected,You have to cut out this mirror with scissors and doesn't look the same as the original :(The only good thing was that i got a refund without any hassle.
4,Does the job,"This reasonably price theromoeter/hygrometer gets the job done. The outside temperature is updated may once every ~1min. The indoor readings are updated probably once ~30sec. This is slow, but it's okay and helps prolong battery life.The only gripe I have is the way the unit stands. It stands vertically, which makes it difficult to read the measurements comfortably sitting or standing."
4,Even My Aged Mother-in-law Can Use This!,"I bought this for my mother-in-law to replace an old unit that no longer worked. She has a real trouble with technology, but is getting on fine with the Timex Wireless. It's a relatively cheap product - and you get what you pay for! But it works well, has large clear numbers and is simple to operate."
2,not one of Ormandys better Tchaikovsky recordings,"skip this and get ormandys sleeping beauty and nutcracker recordings there better,for some odd reason Ormandy just seems off in his interpertation of this masterpiece once again stick with Charles Dutiot and the Montreal Symphony version."
1,These are Junk!!,Product only charged twice and when they worked only lasted 1 hour on a camera. Don't buy these buy a real Sony battery.
5,Very Helpful and Entertaining at the same time,"This book is a compilation of stories about mother-in-laws that's been very helpful for my new fiance and I. The stories were eye-opening as to what to expect when we get married, and some were quite hilarious. We're already having some of the same problems with my mom. ""How to Deal With Your Mother-in-law"" is a must have for anyone who is going to get married anytime soon. The funniest book I've read in a while!"
1,On hating other women,"This is a pretty hostile book as one can see from the cover, if you really want to hate other women because you share a common affection for the same man (her son and your husband) buy this book right away! You will be sure to live out your hostilities with permission; however, if you are not willing to wallow in such aggression, maybe buy a book that is better balanced and thus help yourself to achieve a balance that is more healthy for you and your family."
3,sound is muddy,"I am a big fan of fairground attraction, and was happy to get a cd to replace my old media. Unfortunately the sound is very muddy-- worse than my old tape on my old tape deck. I'm sorry to say it, but it's clearer driving in my car."
5,Awesome,"Very good music, easy to listen to, excellent lyrics. These guys can rock and play super mellow. So far these guys are my favorite band in this genre, I really never feel like they are trying to sound like someone else. Sounds are very catchy and thoughtful. Very highly recommended. First bought Open Container then this album, this one takes first so far."
4,Eyewitness to History --,"Riveting read. Unexpectedly good and important. A story about Jimmy Carter I didn't know. An absolutely crucial moment of transition between the Old and New South told by one who was there. It shaped his whole career. Stories of voting fraud and political intrigue worthy of the Chicago machine, used against anyone who threatened reform. In this case, the reform was one man, one vote and equality under the law for African Americans -- revolutionary concepts for rural Georgia. Ends with a taut courtroom scene worthy of any good movie. Well written and not overly long. Carter is a good storyteller and has a spare, elegant literary style."
3,trailer music,"i listened to the servant song and i know everyone said its pretty well known that that is the song they used in the trailer, but if you listen to ""broken chairs"" by built to spill it really sounds like parts of the trailer music too. and its also a good song. so i would recommend trying that as well!"
4,"An addendum to ""FangsFirst"" comment","FangsFirst is absoluty correct -- trailer music is almost never on the movie's soundtrack. An interesting additional bit of trivia, however; almost all trailer themes ARE from a movie soundtrack, just from a DIFFERENT movie than the one the trailer is for!So if you're looking for ""Cells"" by The Servant (the song from the Sin City trailer), take a look at the soundtrack to Transporter 2. You'll find it along with another song by The Servant. ""Cells"" does have lyrics to it (which aren't on the Sin City trailer), but it's still a damned good song.Just thought I'd share that with everybody."
5,good soundtrack,"pure film background music, if you love sin city this is the perfec complement, speciali if you like the movie and you do not have read the comics, this gona put you in mud, XD"
1,Main song not there,Be careful when buying this soundtrack. See the movie first and be sure you like the weird orchestra jazz. Its nothing like what you hear on the trailer. And the song from the trailer is not on the CD.
1,"Movie awsome, soundtrack blows....","the music from the trailer is NOT on the soundtrack.I repeat, the music from the trailer is NOT on the soundtrack"
4,"Informative book, somewhat negative tone","I may disagree slightly with other reviewers of this book, but as a pre-adoptive parent, this book has been slightly difficult for me to read. I understand that looking at all aspects of adoption is important, but I frequently felt like I was getting the message from this book that adoption will cause long-term unresolved issues in every single adoptee. Perhaps the viewpoint I'm aluding to is simply that Dr. Pavao's work is with children who have been troubled in some manner via their adoption, but in all honesty, I have felt somewhat discouraged after the reading of this book.That being said, I think this book would still be a good choice to read as a pre-adoptive parent, but would balance it out with other books. Also, for those looking for a book on the ""process"" of adoption, this would not be a good choice."
2,Cute announcements but too much money here.,"I ordered these and I didn't know how many I'd get. I received 10 in a box with envelopes. With shipping these cost me over $20.00! I contacted Amazon and told them that I only have one pack and this is supposed to be a ""double pack"". They sent me another shipment (I'm to return the original)but I am still not sure what the quantity will be. I feel the advertising here is very misleading and I hope they change it to include a quantity.These are very, very cute and I need 50 of them but not at this price. I search the web and found them elsewhere for a fraction of the cost."
4,NKJV/NIV Parallel Bible Review,"Product arrived in great shape. This is the best comparison of reliable traditional and modern Bible translations. And, yes, I know what some ""rabid"" folks have to say about the NIV. Boy, is the print small. Just wish that there was a large-print edition, but this particular parallel version appears to be out of print."
5,The Best Portugal has to offer !,"Pedro Abrunhosa is a rebel. He was a jazz teacher, and one day he decided to pick his best students, get in a plain to New York, and meet Prince! Amazing! In the same day he met Maceo Parker (the Louis Armstrong sax man) and invited him to play along in his first album, and Maceo accepted! ""Viagens"" is a great album, a mix-a-lot of jazz, funk, hip-hop, and soul, with Pedro Abrunhosa counting on wonderful Maceo in the saxophone. Listen to ""Socorro"", ""No Posso Mais"", ""Tudo O Que Eu Te Dou"" and of course ""É Preciso Ter Calma"". Acid Jazz is his best with Pedro Abrunhosa."
4,saucy,"Good stuff!! Fresh and saucy!!! Abrunhosa is getting me closer to the portuguese language...and the first track 'nao posso' is simply the best on this album. His deep voice is pure testosterone, really!!"
5,Pedro Abrunhosa is simple great! Best lyrics!,"Abrunhosa has written some of the best songs in Portuguese contemporary music. He truly captures the beauty of the language. He does not claim to be a singer, which he is not trained to be, but the moment you listen to his songs you will be captured by his deep voice and 'poetry'."
3,fans de pedro abrunhosa e dos bandemónio,gostaria de receber um e-mail de alguém que também goste de pedro abrunhosa e dos bandemónio. A minha morada electrónica é Malheira@teleweb.pt
4,"Beautiful illustrations, engaging book for toddlers","My 18-month old son has had this book since he was 7 months old and still enjoys it very much. The illustrations are lovely, and the text is simple but engaging enough to keep him interested.Update: My son is now 24-months old and still really enojoys this book and all the little details in each illustration. It's quite a unique book and turneded out to be a great find!"
5,"Excellent set of films, and excellent on-line purchase experience","I'm not going to go into describing the movies... if you're a Stephen King fan, you've probably already seen at least three of these four flicks. My favorites, in descending order, are: Needful things, Misery, Carrie, and The Dark Half).The product was entirely as described, and the purchase/shipping/receipt experience was flawless."
4,good adaptations,"I've already seen all of them, I just wanted to have them in my collection. They're not Oscar material, still I like them a lot. If you're a King's fan you just have got to have them"
5,Horror DVD,I love horror movies and I loved these movies and I wanted to have them for my collection so I can watch them when I want
2,Look Cheap,"Love each film and saw this at the store then compared the sides to the indivual dvds. So let me say the say of Misery logo looks, as does Carrie as if it was printed cheaply at a factory and sent off. Still i dont know about the films themselves but the papers to the indivual disc just looked cheap"
1,Why?,I'm not sure why this book was written. It's less about the Tour and more about how the tour fits into french history. I'm also wondering who the intended reader is. Avid cyclists who love the tour and it's drama? Or history professors locked in ivory towers studying the minutae of human activity over time.
2,HydroFarm DAUN Daystar Grow Light Reflector,Ad said it came with both 1000W sodium and halide bulbs but did not. Did not have fixture for the bulb to screw into either.
5,Timeless Techniques for Better Oil Paintings,"I have read many books on Oil painting over the last twenty five years.In My view this one of the best art instruction books I have read.Tom Browning is the artist. He communicates the fundamentals of painting including, tone, color, edges, composition, and brushwork.Tom gives you some great ideas for developing as an artist like fast oil paintings done with a timer and sketching with the paint brush.Tom uses a painterly approach in his work and the paintings in this book are flooded with light, he explains the limited palette and the benefits of experimenting with it.I've owned this book for over ten years and have taken it on many painting trips as a source of reference and to keep me inspired for the next day's painting."
4,"Legends of the Guardian King, Book 2 - Great","I read Legends of the Guardian King, Book 1 and really liked it so I continued to Book 2. It was equally good, I can hardly wait to read Books 3 & 4. I had a hard time putting the book down and not reading on to see what happens next."
5,Spending time with a good friend,"This is an excellent series! After The Light of Eidon, reading The Shadow Within was like spending time with a friend. Hancock did a great job developing the characters, especially Abramm. I found myself a little impatient with Carissa's character, (Come on. Get over it already!), but knew everything would come together at the right time. Well worth your time!"
5,The Shadow Within,"How can I count the ways I love this book? I can hardly wait until the next in the series is released. Karen Hancock creates a wonderful world that I can get lost in. I read her books slowly so I can savor them. I know they will end all too soon. I love the allegory and hope that her book will make a difference in other people's lives, as it has in mine. I pray that more Christian fantasy authors like Karen will be raised up soon. I believe there is a great demand for them."
5,Powerful,"The story is compelling, the allegory inspiring. The author takes the daily uncertainties of the Christian life and weaves them into the life of a king, who must trust in his Savior to win the kingdom. O that we would take seriously the spiritual battles happening around us daily!"
5,Awesome book!,Great characters. A book I couldn't put down! I can't wait to read the rest of the series! I loved this book!
5,Great sequel,"Awesome and heartwarming, it had good bad guys and noble good men. I can't wait for the next one !"
1,Nothin' but Trouble...,"This game may have potential, but we will probably never find out, as every time we have tried to play it, it crashes in the first 10 minutes. Activision e-mailed us a fix, but like the ""Crash Happy"" reviewer above, it did not help at all. We are using a Windows XP PC system. Too bad it was a birthday present for a 10 year old. Needless to say, we are very disappointed. Deer Hunter is a much better game...it actually works."
1,Broke in 4 minutes,The title says it all. The motor caught fire four minutes after I started using it. How much worse can a product possible be?
5,A work of magnificent scope and depth,"In my opinion Glass has captured the sense of awe that one feels contemplating Itaipu itself. This is a work of massive proportions much like the creation of the Itaipu dam, which Glass feels an ""undertaking comparable in daring and inventiveness to the construction of the Egyptian pyramids.""The extensive choral work is written in the language of the Giuranni Indians. Glass often chooses obscure languages for the effect of ""distance."" People who obsess over the choral pieces of ""Carmina Burana"" and/or ""The Mission"" soundtrack, will probably enjoy ""Itaipu"" a lot."
5,Moving!,I first heard this work on NPR and it caught me by surprise how much it grabbed me. Love it!
4,Typical Glass yet excellent,His distintive pipe organ and choral sound is strong in this work. Segments of which are used in many popular films.
3,Moderately intriguing,"There are some good qualities to these two works: the recording quality is excellent, and the overall aura created by the voices and instrumentation is periodically entertaining. But when all is said and done, not much is said and done. Neither ""Itaipu"" nor ""The Canyon"" really manage to grab the listener, although the latter, with its contrapuntal rhythms, makes a better attempt. Ultimately, these works probably will appeal most to Glass completists."
4,A great book for Self starters!,"This is a great book for those who have very basic experience with PIC programming or have read ""Easy Pic'N"". The book is short but you'll learn fast (the author has good sense of humor)."
1,Do Not Buy This Toy!!!,"I bought this toy for my nephew and he was so excited. Unfortunately, one of the cars didn't work. I called the company (Interactive Toy) to get a new car but they wouldn't accept a return after 30 days and refused to budge on that policy even after I explained how crushed my nephew was, AND that I had only purchased this product less 2 months prior. On top of it all their customer service reps were extremely discourteous. Do not buy this product unless you like cheap toys, bummed out kids, and big hassles."
1,Poor Quality,Only one of the cars worked and since I had purchased the toy in November and given it is a Xmas gift the company would not replace it as it was over 30 days since purchase. Waste of money!
2,Poor job!,"A guide book needs clear directions. I followed four of their hikes and got mixed up one way or the other on all four. We headed to one place with a dog, but were met with a 'no pets' policy not mentioned in the book. Or distances were omitted or inaccurate. I hope the authors hear of my complaint - don't just write a book for its shelf appeal."
3,"Bad directions, lots of great hike descriptions, though","I decided to make this a summer of hiking in my own backyard, and I agree, I had trouble finding many of the hikes because of things like Lee Hill Rd instead of the streetsign, Lee Hill Drive, little things like that can throw you off, I took my own computer maps with me before most hikes. Also, you will see 4 miles out and back, then realize the trailmap at the trail head will tell you that a route is 3.7 miles one way. You must read their descriptions to see what they are calling the half-way point. On the other hand, they had many great hikes listed, many features very accurately described. Prepare yourself with your own map first, and you will save many headaches."
2,bad directions all around,"Not only did we find it difficult to find the trailheads but we found it difficult to follow the described trails. The trail directions are not broken out separately but included throughout the narrative. You must have an accompanying trail map to make sense of it. I also found basic info lacking, like this trail is snowbound until June or this trail doesn't allow dogs, etc.Like the photos, appreciate the descriptions: ""saucy chipmunks"" and such, but didn't like the lack of basic clarity."
1,Canon Service is Horrible,"The G2 would be a good camera, if only it didn't break so often! The CF reader went bad in July and was quickly repaired. The lens jammed in August. They returned it to me four times, each time replacing the same part that didn't fix the problem the first time. It's almost November and I still don't have a working camera! I'll never buy a Canon product again- I've paid so much in shipping and repairs, not to mention wasting my time talking to customer service. All this and I still have to buy film!"
4,Powershot G2,"I got this camera about 2 months ago and I must say that it is the best digital camera I have used or seen. The picturequality is perfect and the colors are true and bright. The only problem I have with it is the manual focus. MF is something you don't always get with a Digacam so I like the fact that Cannon put it in, but it is to hard to use. All in all if you need a ditial camera then this is the one for you."
5,Brings new joy to Photography,"I am a serious amateur photographer who has been holding out for higher resolution digital cameras. I bought this camera for my snapshot photography and am so impressed with the 8x10s I am getting, I probably won't go back to my film based system. It is great to not have the hassle of getting slides processed, sorting them on the light table and then getting suitable prints made.I will eventually get a Canon D60 body for my EOS lenses, but for now, I am having too much fun with the G2."
3,Great features -- But NO red-eye reduction?!,"This is a great camera, with wonderful features. BUT...The red-eye reduction system does not work. Instead of flashing twice, as most cameras do, the G2 projects a ""bright"" beam a light while you focus on your subject. This beam is not bright enough to constrict the pupils in the first place, and is not wide enough to even hit the pupils in a typical composition. You have to attempt to flash the beam in the subjects' eyes before taking the picture--very difficult to impossible.For this price, and considering all of the advanced features, I would expect better. I cannot recommend this camera because of this egregious flaw.Canon G2 Owners: Please complain to Canon if this bothers you--maybe it could be fixed with a software upgrade."
1,Poor customer service plagues Canon,"Wow, talk about poor customer service. I purchased the G2 and when it arrived today and did not work properly I contacted Canon. They said they would gladly repair the camera but were unwilling to replace it or guarantee a quick turn around. With a planned trip to the Carribean next week I'm stuck with a non-refundable plane ticket, a defective camera, and a company who could care less about helping solve a problem caused by their defective product. It seemed reasonable to me that they correct this problem but a supervisor told me that Canon does not replace defective cameras. I read another posting about Canon's poor customer service but thought it was just a fluke. I assure you that is not the case. Even the best companies have defective products, but I was expecting more from Canon in terms of correcting the problem. Buyer beware! PS, I hear Nikon and Minolta are very responsive and customer focused. I plan to return my camera and purchase anything but a Canon."
5,This is a great camera!,I love this camera - it's got it all...even a battery that lasts forever! It's a great investment to make...all-around excellent quality!
5,This is an EXCELLENT camera,"I bought a G2 a long time ago for almost $500. This is when they were a current model. Had it for many years with zero trouble. Great pictures, great flexibility, great feel. Finally bought a Nikon digital SLR and a Canon digital ELPH camera and stopped using the G2. Sold it n eBay in excellent shape for about $150 a couple of years ago.Bought several other Canon cameras in the meantime including a brace of SD1200IS's, an S3, a A70, and an S60. All nice to very nice cameras.Recently was looking through eBay and noted that G2's had fallen in price so that you got buy full kit G2's for about $50. In other words, free.So I bought one. It is awesome and I am in love with a G2 again. The handling is great, the full controls are great, the images are excellent. It is my favorite camera for when you don't need something tiny.If you want a true semi-pro digital camera for very little money, check out the G2 and it successors. Huge value and performance."
4,Great camera.,"I've been using this camera for more than a year and I'm fully satisfied with it. It has small auto focusing problem in the certain conditions, but it doesn't happen often."
5,Powershot G2,The Powershot G2 is an awesome camera. It has loads of capability and flexibility for both manual and automatic shooting. The picture quality is outstanding...and upload to PC is fast and easy. This camera also has an excellent design and feel. It's heavier and feels more solid than many other digital cameras in this range. It feels good in your hands. An excellent choice for a 4 MP camera.
3,Great camera wrecked by lousy autofocus.,"A great digital camera-- with a major, major problem. The autofocus (...). Its that simple. I've got a Nikon 990 and a Canon Powershot S100, and I've never had the number of poorly focussed images that I've taken with the G2.The G2 has major advantages-- integration with Canon's flash system being notable, and extremely high resolution, especially in Raw mode; but you will go nuts with the focus."
1,Not impressed,"I bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas. He loves doing art and is great at putting things together i.e., legos so I thought he would enjoy this. He loves dinosaurs so we decided to do the origami dinosaur. We got to step 3 out of 20 and had to stop. He could not figure it out and I could not figure it out. The instructions were not user friendly or accurate. I believe it would have been better if they had a DVD to provide the instructions."
3,Should be called 'Developing for Sybase EAServer',Full book is devoted to Sybase EAServer. In some chapters you can learn something about PowerBuilder with EAServer. I was expecting more about JSP and Web Targets. Buy it **only** if you are planning to use Sybase EAServer.
1,Not helpful for me,"I am almost 10 Years with Powerbuilder. I thought this book will show me step by step EA Server and Internet Development, as the Cover Page named after. But this book completely disappointed me. Lots of contents without generating any interest to read the next page, even the next line....Wish there be a good book on Powerbuilder 9 and Internet Development! This book is not really showing how to start up and go step by step building internet applications.I am waiting for a good book on PB 9 in the market."
5,Five Stars for Five Star Story,"I was late into seeing five star stories, never got a chance to see it when it debuted in the late 80's, but I did however, get a chance to catch up on the title in the early 90's. I must admit that the soundtrack is exceptional. The music is a bit retro however these days, but, it truly speaks for anime music, its got its own style. Not recommended to those that haven't seen the movie yet! A great addition to your collection!^___^"
4,Good Devotional,"Another great devotional by Andrew Murray. This devotional starts off with a 31 day prayer section. Each day you have a what to pray sentence and a how to pray sentence as well as a message. After this section there are many exta prayers for a large variety of topics. So if you are fearful, just look for a prayer in the fear section to help you! A must read to help you be lifted up."
4,GREAT BUT A BIT ODD ON THE END.,"I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT WAS VERY AMUSING ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE SEX SCENES SEEMS A BIT ROUGH. WHAT REALLY TICKED ME OFF WAS THE ENDING. THE VERY MAIN CONFLICT IN THE WHOLE STORY WASN'T RESOLVE! THE BIG VILLIAN ,KARPON, FROM THE BEGINING WAS NOT EVEN MENTION EVER. KARPON EVEN SAID "" IT IS NOT OVER!"" WELL WOW! I MEAN, HOW DO I KNOW WHAT THEIR FUTURE'S GONNA LEAD TO. ARE THEY GOING TO DIE OR LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITH THE BIG VILLIAN STILL LIVING AT LARGE AND TAKING OVER THE HEROINE'S KINGDOM? OH YEAH, I FORGOT! THE HEROINE IS SOMEWHAT OF A NOBILITY WHO PROBABLY HAS THE RIGHT TO RULE OVER A KINGDOM.A VERY CONFUSING ENDING AND UNCERTAIN. AND WHAT IS WITH EVERY BOOK, MENTIONING REJAR'S GREAT POWER! IT'S GETTING SO ANNOYING!"
4,Make sure you read the others in the series first!!!!,"Dara Joy has done a wonderful job with this series, and I have loved all the books (Rejar and Knight of a Trillion Stars). With a wicked imagination and a keen sense of humor, reading Gian Ren and Jenise's story was truly a treat. Of course I want Traed's story, but I'm also curious about the familiar left on Jenise's planet. Such sensual creatures those familiars are! I hope Ms. Joy keeps true to the talent of her previous books on whatever she chooses to write next."
5,GREAT BOOK!! MUST READ!!,"After finishing the Sookie Stackhouse Series I was looking for a good book or series and this was a GREAT continuation!!!! I loved the book and couldnt put it down!!!! Once I finished I couldnt wait to read the second book Rejar and MAN WAS I dissapointed!!!! What a waist!!! I thought I was going to have a good series of books but it was so bad I could only get half way thru it and stopped. If you want a single good book to read, Mine to Take is worth it and AWESOME but dont bother on the second book."
5,SHE DID IT AGAIN !!!!,"What a great book! The lady knows how to write. She always makes you anxious for her next book. It was great meeting Lorgin & Adeean again. I did not get to meet Rejar's wife (Lilac) and her aunt as much as I would have liked to; but maybe next time. ""Knight of a Trillion Stars"" was an appetizer, ""Rejar"" was the fish course, ""Mine to Take"" the meat course. So where is the, starch (Traed's story), vegetable (the mysterious Familiar left with the old women), dessert(a story to tie it all together) or something to cleans the palate (someone new)? There is no need to tell the story over, to say that I gave it five stars, speaks for it's self. I have only one complaint. Finding Dara Joy's books in a book store is like pulling teeth, without any thing to kill the pain. They just don't want to stock her books, or they are not stocking enough of them; either way I'm searching."
4,Only problem -- over too quick!,"I really enjoyed this one...I didn't know it was coming out and got a big smile when I saw it at the bookstore. Then I started reading and couldn't put it down! As the other reviews say -- it is great to catch up with old characters. This combined the serious ""quest"" of the first book with the humor and hot stuff of all her books. I have read all of Ms. Joy's books and they are all great. HIGH ENERGY is sizzling and funny and her regency TONIGHT OR NEVER is the same. I love her characters!!! Check out the others if you have only read the Matrix set."
2,"Book is amazing but is not in ""used, good"" condition!","I love this book, which is why I ordered it here. It was listed as ""used, good"" so I expected it to be in 2nd-hand condition. I think it should have been titled more than ""used"" or at least a description added to that (and definitely not ""good"") - it is not only used but is missing pages, someone wrote their name in the inner cover, someone colored with red sharpie or marker all over the first few pages and in the back of the book as well. :( This is more damaged than I expected a used book to be (and I have ordered many used books in the past). I am still happy to have the book - and it got to me pretty fast. I just wish the condition was described more accurately."
4,Really enjoyed this one!,"Whew! Okay. This book is actually listed inside the books, as the 2nd book in the series. I read it out of sequence by mistake, but was still able to follow the story.I can't believe I never heard of these books before.. This one is a very sensual, erotic, romantic, & suspenseful story. Which has an interesting and refreshing take on shifters and their world. It has a bit of a futuristic/sci-fi tone, but not too much. I really liked this one. And all of the characters were well written. It is a short novel, but there is so much story within, that you will not feel as though something is missing. I highly recommend this read. I am starting book 1 ""Knight of a Trillion Stars"" and then will be moving on to book 3 ""Rejar"" His story I am very eager to read."
4,Embarassing cover...Great book. :),"OK....you've just gotta love Dara Joy..even if her writing style isnt exactly your taste, there is no denying that her stories are wildly entertaining. ""Mine to Take"" is the 3rd in the series that began with ""Knight of a Trillion Stars"" and ""Rejar"". This was my least favorite of the 3..thats not to say it wasnt a great book, but come on..it's hard to beat ""Rejar""!!! I will tell you now that there are some seriously sexy lovescenes in this book..wooohooo..open your windows ladies..you'll need that blast of cold air to keep your head clear...whew!! ""Mine to Take"" is a book that I would recommend..and if youre into this series..it's a DEFINITE MUST READ...I am waiting with bated breath for Traed's story...I just KNOW his will be soooooo good!!!"
3,Please change the Cover Art!!!,"I like the premise of this series - Aviara, the 'Familiar' race, 'nice' affectionate alpha males, some humor. I find her writing style OK. There are many other writers whose actual writing style I find of much higher quality - Mary Balogh, Emma Holly, Susan Sizemore, to name a few. But what I really HATE about Dara Joy's books are the covers!! They are EMBARASSING; enough so that I will never purchase one of her books in a store. Anyone else agree?"
2,Dissappointing as well as insulting,"Oh my gosh. I do not know what is up with all these 5 star ratings! I read this book and by the time I got to the end I was ready to toss the damn thing out the door! Admittedly this book was well written, and had a nice plot line, but the characters were terrible! Gian was a self centered, manipulative and arrogant $*%&#@$! He used and abused Janise throughout the whole story, treating her less than human! He took away all her rights as an intelligent being, and controlled and manipulated her to further his self interests. Janise was weak and easily lead astray from her goal of freedom and liberty. She escaped the prison of Karpon, to be locked away in the prison that Gian made for her. Is this what all Ms. Joy's books are like? If so, then I am NOT going to read any more from her. These characters were an insult to any intelligent and independent woman. I had really expected more."
2,I don't know,"I was a actually enjoying the book until I came to one sex scene that was like a horrible assault. I'm very open minded to all forms of sexuality, but this seemed to much like a rape. I found it disturbing in the midst of rather silly, whimsical romance."
4,You'll never look at cats the same way again!,This story is AWESOME! The story is interesting from page 1. The characters engage you right away. There was not enough background info on Jenise's heritage. The same with Deana and Lilac. I hope Ms. Joy fixes this soon. Such gaps leave the story a bit lob-sided. Gian is incredible! Cold showers become a bit of a habit with this book. Get the entire series!
5,Wow.. HOT,"This was the best book of the series. Much better than REJAR. The heroine and hero were well matched. She was independent and intelligent. He was sexy, intelligent and knew how to get what he wanted, but still respected her. THis is a keeper to read again. I am looking forward to Traed's story. Hope it is forthcoming."
5,EXCELLENT,"I have read all of the Matrix of Destiny series and I have to say this book was my favourite. I can't wait and see what Traed's story would be like. Dara Joy is and always a very talented writer, keep it going."
5,MORE! PLEASE!,"After reading the whole Matrix of Destiny (I think that's what it's called) series, I have to say, I'm completely hooked. Dara has a grasp of the written word not easily found today, and the quality of the imagery in the story is fabulous. Her characters are lovable and yet always seem like someone you should know. Honestly, Rejar hooked me. And with the tantalizing little glimpses we have in Mine To Take of a continuation of his storyline leaves me wanting more and more! Please Dara, if you read any of these reviews, I beg you to hurry and give us Traed's & Dariq's story soon! Their public is waiting!"
5,You Won't Want Any Distractions When You Read This One!,"Get rid of your family, turn off the phone, kill the television, and then fix yourself a large pot of coffee...you're going to be up all night reading this one! When you're done, call your lover and tell him to come over (or let your husband back into the house). Then, hit them over the head with this book, wave it under their nose and tell them to go sign up for SEX101---and not to come back until they do! If Dara Joy truly knows any men like this, THEY NEED TO BE CLONED!"
3,Dara's books have great potential!,"Hi, I would have given this book five stars, but I had to take away at least two because she allows the heroines in this series to become complacent in their situations. The ""heroes"" manipulate, kidnap, and disimpower all of the heroines, they are then placed in situations where the only way they can benefit society is to become good breeders because, once imprisoned, they are in a situation where they have no skills and can't even read the language.This tendency of this author is the only thing that irritates me about her books. Maybe that's because I don't suffer from bondage/Stockholm syndrome fantasies.I enjoy science fiction and would enjoy Futuristic Romances more if the authors didn't give into the temptation to transfer the me-babarian/ you-sex-slave historical romance plots into futuristic settings. After all, who would want to give up ALL of their freedom and virtually all of their self-worth for good sex?"
1,Merely finishing a manuscript must get her published.,"Too many scenes of extra-terrestrials standing around explaining the rules of their species/planet/power/inheritance/etc. I really could not follow the Sci-Fantasy aspects at all. But that's not why most people are purchasing the book, is it?"
1,I cannot stand the covers on Dara Joy's books.,"I enjoy this author's writing, but the book cover designs are such a turnoff they detract from the storyline. Hopefully, this will change in the near future."
4,Interesting,"I had to order this book to read for class (Samurai in Japan). It was better than I expected. Very quick read. The book was written in and kind of banged up, but I really have no problem with that. It's not like I wouldn't have done it myself. You can probably finish the book in a couple days if you're focused. It does have it's boring parts, but really, it's enough to keep you interested."
4,One of a kind look into a Japanese Samurai,"This book is the reprinted translated diary of a Samurai in Japan in the early 1800's. It gives the reader a unique look into Japanese society at that time. The samurai in question, Katsu Kokichi, is not a very good samurai which makes this book all the more interesting to read. The reader is drawn into the dilemmas of Katsu and his times. The book also includes beautiful ink drawings and full color plates of tokyo and its environs. This adds to the fullness of the story. This book is perfect for anyone who likes autobiographies or who is interested in Japanese and Asian culture"
2,Take out the human element.,"If there was no human element in this book, it might be 4 stars. It has a slow start. The star of the book,is Victor a Bolo Mark XXXIII of the 4th Regiment, Second Brigade, First Confederation Mobile Army Corps, in the vanguard of an all-out Bolo strike against the planet Caern. The enemy is the Aetryx, shadowy, unknown beings who enslave other species with nothing less than the promise of immortality. As a savage interstellar war begins, Colonel Jon Streicher prepares to lead Victor and the rest of his reigment in a planetary invasion. But the landing falls into a trap. They find themselves stranded and desperately attempting to survive the hellfire chaos of modern warfare as Bolo faces Bolo-human hybrid in a cataclysmic showdown that will uncover unexpected truths, reveal hidden secrets, and even call into question the loyalty of the Dinochrome Brigade itself. Should have only had the Bolo elements in this book."
1,stupid,"This book is too focused on the action and doesn't have anything to really say. The action itself is suspect and, since you have little choice but to pay attention to all the nagging details, you acquire doubts about it. The lead Bolo character jumped on the way down to the surface by a submarine. Nobody thought about the possibility of submarines? And ""nobody expected such stiff resistance."" Oh how original is that. Why do I even notice that the yields on various weapons keep changing around?The biggest disappointment is the Bolos themselves are very boring, when they are supposed to be the draw of a Bolo book.The human characters are frightfully overwrought. The female lead who is in love with the Bolo because she was sexually abused by her father and previous boyfriends? The drug-addicted regimental commander who nips off from his post in the middle of a planetary invasion and starts making out with his XO? Come on. It doesn't serve a purpose."
5,Revealing Within!,I'm a quiet man but soon after opening this book I smiled and then laughed out loud! John takes the quiet thoughts we keep to ourselves and puts them in print and picture for all to see. yes it'll make you smile and laugh but moreso it'll make you think! A great book to leave out for others to pick up and put their minds in gear! Well Done!
5,I LOVE THIS STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE DOLL!!!!!!!!,"I REALLY LIKE STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE AND I LOVE!! THIS DOLL! I LOVE HER CUTE LITTLE OUTFIT! SHE IS WEARING DENIM PANTS, A RED SHIRT, A COOL DENIM JACKET, AND A VERY PRETTY & COLORFUL RED CAP ON HER HEAD. I ALSO LOVE THAT ALL OF THE SS DOLLS ARE STRAWBERRY SCENTED! OH SHE IS JUST SOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!! I HOPE TO GET HER SOON! 5 BIG STARS FOR STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE!!!!!!!"
4,Good Basic Information,This is a great book for the beginer. Covers all of the major systems. Explains systems and maintenance procedures. Highly recommended.
1,didnt get what i wanted,"Instead I receive the box collection on Amittyville horror! If I wanted this movie, I would have purchased it! I am in the middle of 2 moves, my sons and mine, and wasn't about to take the time to have to print the invoice and to send it back, I dont have time for that! And I shouldn't have had to.... This was sent to me, in someone else s name!!"
5,"Columbo - Airdate February 1, 1976",The Columbo episodes are well written and well acted. The series is one of the best produced series of all time. This Columbo story is unique in that it takes place out of the Country in Mexico.
4,Carribean for Lovers (1997),"Resoucefull,and informative for your honeymoon,wedding getaway or even vacation. The price aids in it's accents."
2,Too mellow,"Half the songs were like lullabuys. I know the late 70's and early 80's was a time of balladeers, but this stuff was candleight lounge music."
4,A Dark Look at the Life of a Celebrity's Child,"How often we might envy the lives of children of the rich, the talented and the famous. But Lois Gould's poignant memoir ""Mommy Dressing"" again underscores that a childhood lived in the shadow of glamor but without love and affection is no way to grow up. It is a dark moment when Gould asks her mother about a scar only to learn that her mother, who had a horror of doctors, had a rib surgically removed the better to wear the fashions of the 1920s. Gould's portrayal of herself as the gawky, awkward, intellectual daughter of a beautiful woman who dominated the American fashion industry for a time is reminiscent of Susan Cheever's recollections of her life as the daughter of novelist John Cheever. A quickly read but fascinating book."

5,"A very special, musical space","The Above will take you to a number of very special musical spaces. I listen to this music when the turkeys are getting me down at work, when I'm feeling alone, when finances are stressing me out, and so forth. I put on my headphones and spin The Above and all the craziness goes away.The Above takes me to the zone where none of the worldly, truly trivial problems matter. I find peace here. The visual images I see are both personal and universal. And don't ""shuffle"" this album. In my experience, the order in which the music is presented is integral to the total effect of the album.The Above is smooth music with an edge.It's great for road trips, too. Especially inner city or completely rural landscapes. Listening to it driving through the desert is a special experience.I strongly recommend this album to anyone whose spirit is moved by music. You will not be disappointed.:-Drew"
4,Great Quality,"I loved that these dumbbells were sturdy and easy to handle for me. I wish they had come sooner but they were coming from the manufacturer, who were nice enough to call me when they couldn't fulfill the other part of my order (5 lb. dumbbells). They even asked me if it was okay to send the 3 lb. dumbbells anyway. How nice! (Darn, I wish I have the heavier ones too.)I love them!"
4,cute game for young girls,"My 4 year old received this for Christmas, and had a great time playing it. The game is geared to young girls, probably most appropriate for ages 3-5. It's simple to play, the game moves along quickly, and the remote control is easy to program. I found it for under $20 before Christmas. Even though I like it, it's not worth the $30 I've seen charged. Too simplistic for that price."
2,Not a good value!,"You would be better served buying a board game as this is merely a dvd which cycles the same questions in the same order each time. There are no separate levels, as with many other computer games, and the game pieces are cheap.The only educational value that I can afford this game is possibly ""memory"" and maybe the ""sharing"" of the remote.Other than that it is a very tedious task calibrating the remote and I would honestly not recommend this game at all. This is simply a one hit wonder.If your child is begging for this toy, as was mine, you should redirect them to another."
3,Not what you'd think...,"This is a cute game, but my 3 daughters are all slightly frustrated with it. My 8 yr old is BORED, because she knows all the answers. My 6 yr old knows a lot, but the singing challenges are waaaaaaay too hard. My 4 yr old knows a few, but again, the singing challenges are too hard, and don't leave enough time to guess the answer before revealing the answer. Also, the rest of the challenges go too slow, which you'd think it would be the opposite way around. A cute game, but not worth the money."
1,Sends the wrong message,"My daughter received this as a present. This game sends the wrong message to young girls. First of all, every question focuses on Disney-specific trivia, so it's not educational. But the worst part is that the ""Reward Video"" is a montage of princesses kissing their princes. I don't want my daughter to think that being a woman means being rescued by a man. There are so many other toys out there that are designed to send positive messages to young girls, such as exploring your talents, becoming self-sufficient and using your imagination. Skip this one."
5,Good,received what was expected. The only thing that the picture shows three booklets when the set consists of two.
4,Great tool for graphic design,This product is great and a must have if you work with prints and graphics. The only con is the price. This color bridge set gives you the RGB and CMYK composition of all the coated and uncoated Pantone colors.
5,Great smell,"Really like this product, great smell, lovely bottle. I get compliments every time I wear it. The scent lasts awhile and is not too strong or obnoxious or fruity. I was also glad to find this on amazon."
1,Keep Browsing!!!,"I am a fan of deep house, chillout, and lounge music. I love the Hotel Costes Series, the Karma Collection, and some of the Buddha Bars.I was suckered into buying this CD, and I am regretting it now. Don't make the same mistake.The first CD is reminiscent of Yanni or John Tesh. The second CD is useless. Are you having a dinner party? or are you on a date? This is not the CD to play because one track is flamenco and the next is deep house. There is absolutely no flow!"
4,For Buddha Bar/Claude Challe fans...,A great collection of sexy music on 2 CD's compiled by Claude Challe the master of Buddha Bar. Worth checking out. I especially love French Kiss by Lil' Louie. I remember that track from 1989. That was a great year for Acid. Love love it!! Go get this cd and enjoy it with your lover.SJwww.bestplaylists.com
2,engineer man,"Bought this item and have droped it once. At that time the stain came off the handle. The shipping charges are outrages $12.00 cane with a $8.95 shipping charges. I've checked with other cane companies and the shippping is almost half the price. Never, never, never again."
2,What a disappointment!,"This poor baby cannot do anything right! She is being told ""no"" throughout the entire story. And at the end of the day, she needs to ask her Momma for a kiss goodnight. It would have been nice if the Mother would have atleast told her baby that she loves her when she tucks her in to bed, but she doesn't. This book was such a disappointment without any positive message. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1) was because of the beautiful illustrations."
1,Nothing but negatives,"The book is, not surprisingly, a mirror image of Spike Lee's general demeanor and attitude about life--NEGATIVE. Yes, the mindless repetition of Please baby Please is atrocious, but page after the page what you-and your child--sees and hears is negativity over and over again. DON'T DO THAT! STOP SPLASHING! HURRY UP! NO NO NO NO NO! We all know Spike generally hates life, the man, honkies, Quentin Tarentino, the man, studio execs, the man, and the man. It's sad, frankly, that it's clear that his negativity also crosses over to how he views bringing up children. Can you not show joy and fun to your kids, Spike?"
5,One of our favorite books!,"My kids loved getting this book from the library, so we went ahead and bought it. My 2 year old loves that he can ""read"" along with me now that we've read it so many times and he knows each picture. Definitely one of our favorites."
2,unoriginal,"How has nobody noticed that this book is just like ""No, David"" but with black people in it and way more annoying?"
1,Worst book ever,"I can't believe that trees were killed to produce this awful travesty of a children's book. The text is annoying and idiotic. Kids are supposed to like repetition but the endless begging of ""please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby"" is mind-numbingly horrid, not to mention that it sounds like something you'd hear coming out of the VIP room in a cheesy strip club. I suspect that this monstrosity came into being for two reasons: (1) its authorship by Spike Lee (one of my least favorite people) and (2) the illustrations of the African-American eponymous ""Baby"" makes it attractive as a shower gift for expectant mothers of color.Please, book-buyer, please, pass this one up. Please, please, please."
2,All bad ideas,"I love the pictures in this book, and it was my daughter's go-to book for six nights straight until I consigned it to the garage. My husband and I both thought the book had a negative influence. Don't pour your bowl of cereal over your head ... baby baby please ... Great! She had never thought of that before! (She's two.) Don't stick your tongue out at other people ... please baby please ... again. She hadn't done that until the book arrived. Also not a fan of the one about throwing a tantrum when it's time to leave the playground, refusing to hold mama's hand when requested to, coloring with crayons on the wall, or eating sand.I know all ideas eventually occur to all kids, anyway, but it just seemed unnecessary for us to have a whole book sort of glorifying them. Too bad, because the pictures really are fun."
5,A fun book for babies and toddlers,"My daughter absolutely loves this book. As soon as she could say the word ""ball"", she started pointing to the ball in the book excitedly when it appeared (just on a couple pages, but it's amazing how many things can look like a ball to a 1 year old). It has a fun rhythm to it and is the perfect length for younger kids. We checked this book out at the library and just kept renewing it, but when someone else put a hold on it, we knew we had to get our own copy."
5,works like a charm!,"I'm a toddler teacher(18-24 months) and when my kids(all 14 of them!) are cranky, whiny, or just plain 2 year olds, all I have to do is break this book out! They come sit by me and we read the book~they'll speak it aloud with me, making faces and gestures along with the child in the book. Especially for the ""No, in the TRASH, baby baby baby please!"" segment~the child throwing her diaper in her toybox~they all wave their hands in front of their faces, yelling ""ewwww!""They love this book, and I love it too!"
5,Adorable little story book,"I ordered this book to read to my 18-month-old daughter and am not disappointed. The illustrations are gorgeous and relatable, both to myself as the parent, but also to my daughter. She loves looking at the little girl eating sand and pouring cheerios on her head. Just like she does! It's cute, easy to read, and perfect for bedtime because it's possible to read it several times in just a few minutes. Very glad I bought the book."
5,"Please, Mommy, read it again...","Please, Baby, Please is an endearing little book that will be enjoyed by children and parents alike. Both my four-year-old boy and my eighteen-month-old girl want to read it over and over.Spike Lee and his wife Tonya have written a heart-warming book chronicling a typical day-in-the-life of a toddler and her cajoling, sometimes exasperated, mother. Kadir Nelson's illustrations fit hand in hand with the text and serve to make the story more vivid. Readers will find themselves falling in love with the curly-headed, lovable little toddler... and sympathizing with her mother.With a simple, clever text and delightful illustrations, this book should become a favorite for years to come."
3,Wish I could love this book,"I LOVE the pictures in this book. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the story line. As many other reviews have pointed out, the baby is treated as a nuisance all day long. I would have killed to see one page where baby got some positive reinforcement. And what baby doesn't get up too early or walk too slow? Mama needs a chill pill. I agree that the constantly changing refrain makes this book even more tedious to read. I'd give the text of this book 1 star, and the pictures 5 stars."
5,Beautiful illustrations and plenty of things to make parents smile,"I love this book. I first saw it at the library and ended up buying a copy for my 1-year-old because we both loved it so much. The illustrations are gorgeous. They make me want to buy every book that this man ever illustrated. And parents will smile at every page, because they all show a baby girl doing something that all of our babies have done that make us roll our eyes."
4,Be Prepared,"This is my 2 year old's absolute favorite book and calls the main character by her own name because of the uncanny resemblance in both appearance and personality. We both love the rhythm and the illustrations, but I held one star back because I believe that it inspired some naughty behaviors. I definitely noticed more sand eating and wall art after we had read the book a few times. So be prepared!"
4,Lovely Read,I loved this book because it was a funny and lovely read. I pictured Spike Lee saying the lines as I was reading the story. The illustrations were beautiful too.
5,We love it,My 2 year old daughter loves this book especially the end and can not wait until the last page so she can say it with me
1,HORRIBLE PILE OF POO,This controller came out of the box with an AWESOME option known as the fire and forget. The F***ing controller would turn off its power every time you hit the fire button... AWESOME!!!!! Don't buy this pile!!!!!
1,Horrible,"Stay away from this controller. It's very unresponsive, especially when using the digital pad."
4,Only 4 stars when compared to Herb Remington,"This is a fine album. The only reason I rate it 4 stars is compared to Herb Remington. Herb's Steeling albums, his Floyd Tillman album and 'A Jimmy Day with Herb Remington', all from Glad Music are better by at least 1 star - in my humble opinion."
3,Good for Advanced Players,"If you are an beginner or intermediate player (rated under 1600) you find this book very difficult to understand and use. I am rated about 1300 by the United States Chess Federation. The book concentrates more on chess than psychology and I would more highly recommend N. Krogius book on ""Chess Psychology"" or even Robert Snyder's ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" which has a comprehensive chapter on Chess Psychology (and a lot more)."
5,When you lose someone you love,"I have bought this book for at least 25 friends. Everyonetells me how much they love the wording. At a time whenwords are difficult to come by, this book does it very well"
1,Not useful,"I bought this book for a class, and never even opened it. If you want to be an SLP, this book will not help you much. Buy a real textbook, with specific disorder-related information, and you will be better off."
2,Just a superficial summary,"This book would have been more worthwhile if the authors had truly analyzed the responses in order to evaluate potential trends across the profession. Instead, those responses were simply reported, so that one has to slog through the reportage on all the firms to discern trends."
3,Useful resource,"I thought this book was fair, but I thought the ""Vault Reports Guide to America's Top 50 Law Firms"" provided more insight into life at the top firms."
5,"Mudsplash Bullfrog picked the right ""FLAVOR"" for this one","My personal favorite is track #1 ""FNU"", the song has alot of energy and....well just ROCKS. The second track ""FLAVORS"" is a nice follow up song to a track that just blew me away, i would say a nice smooth song for a title track.Carnival, track #3 its a good thing i have the cd instead of the cassette because the spot on the tape this song is located would be worn out already.Nice job on the whole thing. A GREAT PURCHASE, LOVE LISTINING TO IT(WHEN I CAN SNEEK IT AWAY FROM MY WIFE'S CD PLAYER)"
5,Life like item with much enjoyment,"I find these to be the best creatures Star Wars come out with! They are very RARE and Hard to find but, these guys are a must have in my collection."
5,Shelton is a fabulous guitarist!,"I've been a Dan Shelton fan since 1990 and I continue to be awed by this man's talent. His new CD, Soft Latin Nights, is wonderfully romantic music--perfect as a soft instrumental background. I love to pour a glass of wine and just listen to this CD with the lights down low.All ten songs on this CD are Shelton's own original compositions and I understand he did all the arrangements as well as the guitar leads. My personal favorite is ""Without You"" but all the songs are great and it's really hard to choose the best. I've also heard him play live, and he can out-perform most any guitarist there is.If you like intricate guitar pieces, a soft sound with a Latin flair, get this album!"
4,What you see is what you get,"Its as simple as that. Yes I know, its a cookie cutter answer, but what can I say, its the truth!"
1,Didn't look like a football helmet,This cutter arrived fairly quick however I was very disappointed in that it did not look like a football helmet in the picture. After some bending I managed to convert it somewhat into a helmet snapped cutter.
4,A fun collection of Mexican-American essays.,This collection of short essays on the Chicano experiencesis a fun quick read. For anyone interested in Mexican-American culture.
1,Wrong book,Thanks for asking.I purchased the Student's book number 4 and you've sent to mee the workbook instead.It happened the same with the book number 5.I don't know why it happened.........I'm not satisfyied with your service.Regards.
2,Weak flavor,I found this very weak in flavor compared to loose leaf Pu-ehr. Didn't really care for it.
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book when I bought it, but I am somewhat disappointed. I usually like unique female heroines, but for some reason Fox was incredible unappealing. I think if she said ""fricking"" one more time I would have thrown the book out the window. I think the author used superficial elements to try to convey Fox as a spirited, unique, independent woman, i.e. bacon grease, rough language, cigars etc. I would have preferred the author to use a bit more character depth to convey ""true grit"" and independence. I agree with the other reviewer whose visual on Tanner sucking on sweaty toes says it all."
4,The cover should have an 'Annie Oakley' character on it!,"The story is good- Fox is out for revenge against the man that stole her inheritance, her step-father. Peaches is a black man that somewhat raised her and they have been traveling together off & on all of Fox's life. Tanner shows up with 2 others guarding his ransom money and now he needs a guide to get him cross country to Denver in time to save his father's life that is in jeopardy.The book is great. Peaches and Fox have the sweetest of relationships and the end is good (if you haven't guessed by now from other reviews). Personally, I am glad I didn't read them first- so there was a little suprise factor there for me to enjoy. And, yeah, there are parts that are unbelievable- like Tanner kissing Fox's toes straight out of her boots. But laugh it off and enjoy the story. I have enjoyed the MO books I have read and this was not disappointment!"
2,Les Bains Disappointed,"Being a Claude Challe fan as a result of the Buddha bar series, I really thought that this Cd (being one of his first)would be fabulous. Alas I'm so disappointed..there a few select tracks that stand out, however most of it is dancefloor/techno stuff that blends so much into each following track, that in the end it all sounds the same. If your looking for the unique sounds created by Claude on the Buddha bar & some of his later CD's, I suggest you give this one a miss."
3,also dissapointed,I agree with one of the preceding posts. Why were songs number 4 and 12 taken out of the original release!? Those two songs were absolutely brilliant and replaced by some lame tunes! What was Claude thinking?
1,A Royal Scam,"These demos were released without Donald Fagen and Walter Becker's approval and against their wishes. ""The Root of Steely Dan"", ""Old Regime"", ""Sun Mountain"", ""Android Warehouse"", ""Catalyst"", ""The Founders of Steely Dan"", ""Becker and Fagen (or Fagen and Becker) Presents"" and the dozens of other titles this same collection of demos are constantly repackaged under are in their most primitive forms. Do you really think Steely Dan, a band known for their sonic perfection, would want this revealed to the public? If you're a Dan completist and care to hear the earliest demo versions of a few SD classics Barrytown (Pretzel Logic) Caves of Altamira (The Royal Scam), and Brooklyn (Can't Buy A Thrill) try and borrow a copy rather than buy it. I wouldn't give the cretin who released this a penny."
1,Strawberry nipple nibbler,This doesnt taste very good at all. They shoul have left out the tingle stuff. It has a great scent though and is gentle on the skin.
5,Fun & Tasty!,Love It! It's cool sensation coupled with the yummy strawberry flavor is a Treat for Both Of Us!! Highly Recommend!! ;-D
5,LOVE THIS STUFF!!,I have used this stuff for YEARS as chapstick! It keeps your lips very moist. I wouldnt use anything else on my lips.
5,take that Usa,much did it again. this woud beat any mtv cd. al of these songs (exepit J) are hits just to prove u again much music beat mtv again. oh and by the I AM CANADIN
1,Totally Disappointing,"I'm not much on writing reviews but I felt I had to comment on this title. I love saxophone (I own one), I have at least 30 CDs of sax players, and Ace Cannon is a great musician. That said, out of the 3,000 or so albums I've purchased across my life, this easily ranks in the bottom 10.Yes, a sax can play all the notes in these songs, but what can it add? Streets of Laredo? Swanee River? Cotton Fields? I wonder if Mr. Cannon is ashamed a label took all this filler and made a title out of them? I know I'm ashamed for him.This man can flat play. Look for something else that demonstrates that fact. This particular set of tracks is simply awful."
3,blah,"not a bad book but by no means good. it's like 7 pages long and not as comprehensive as I was hoping, but for the price it's not a bad investment if you're going to take the exam."
5,Pay Attention to the Subtitle,"I have never seen Vol. I, so I do not know what material is covered there.""Communications Networks"" is misleading as a title to the modern reader. This is Prof. Guillemin's discussion of transmission lines and related lumped constant circuits. As with his other works, rather than being encyclopaedic, he does a clear, logical thorough exposition of carefully limited subject matter.This is early Guillemin, so the work is devoted to analysis and explanation more than systematic understanding of fundamentals. Nevertheless, it is the Master at work, and I suspect there are very few readers who will not come out with new (to them) insights and an appreciation of having been exposed to the working of a first class mind.Upper division or graduate level electrical engineering or physics."

4,"SEASON THREE, EPISODE EIGHT","The eigth episode of this third season, A FRIEND IN DEED, was broadcasted on May 5th, 1974. It's also possible to watch this episode in the DVD standard by purchasingColumbo - The Complete Third Season. This episode is directed by the well-known actor Ben Gazzara who, with Peter Falk, belongs to this batch of actors who used to work with director John Cassavetes.This is not the best episode of the season but the way Columbo manages to confound the murderer is brilliant."
2,Not one of Lowell's best,"EL uses the land as a metaphor for her romance - this one takes place in Hawaii - hence a passionate, hot romance. Unfortunately, this one doesn't really deliver. Our cynical hero, Chase, sets out to humiliate our heroine, Nicole in order to protect his brother & his brother's marriage. He humiliates her very well and proves himself to be a jerk. . . a total jerk. Nicole runs too hot & cold to be truly believable - flirts wildly, dances half naked and then wonders why men get all hot and bothered. She's also kind of a doormat - she forgives Chase for humiliating her, hurting her, saying the worst things possible - she should have told him to take a hike and find a guy who would treat her well!"
3,Toss-up between good and bad,"When it's working, it's an excellent device. It won't detect any wireless access points(either Secure or unsecure) after restarting the computer, however. The only way to get it working again is to reinstall the driver utility, and that's very annoying. I tried the latest driver from the website, and still experiencing the same problem. Does anyone have the same problem? I would like to seek some help. Trendnet customer service is of no help...no reply for a week yet. My system: Dell 4600; Window XP; 2G RAM. Overall: 5 stars when it's working; 0 star when you have to reload the driver after every startup."
4,Worked with Ubuntu Gutsy out of the box!,"I am really impressed with this card. I installed it in 5 minutes in my desktop and when I powered up Ubuntu the card was detected right away. All I needed to do was select the SID and type in the password and that was it!I dual booted into my windows XP home edition and tried to install the driver but the install failed for some reason unknown to me. I am still debugging this part of it.Great of Ununtu (Linux), jury still out on windows."
4,Shipping or Manufacturing Problems,"When I got the card in the mail, I opened the box up to find that the entire metal portion of the card, was bent completely out of shape. It was simple to bend it back into place but I should not need to do that, now that it is installed, the card is giving me faster and more reliable internet, which is helpful for my needs."
1,Drivers don't work,"Good luck getting this one to work. I tried four different drivers - the drivers included on the CD, Windows' built-in Atheros NIC drivers, and both drivers from TRENDnet's very own web site (yes, there are drivers for each of the two different hardware versions of this card), and none of them worked. I couldn't open the TRENDnet utility, couldn't adjust Windows' wireless network settings, and couldn't start the Wireless Zero Configuration service. It also made my computer hang on two occasions. Utter crap!"
2,it hurts my computer,"This product kept causing my computer to freeze. Also, its ability to find wireless signals is unpredictable. I have the Windows 2000 operating system, which this wireless card is supposed to support. Many other users of this product have fewer problems, though. The customer support service is awful. Besides the employees having thick accents, they said that they would call me back, but they never did. This happened twice. It is probably because they did not know how to solve my problem."
1,BAD Windows 98 Compatibility ... baaaAAAAAHHHHD Tech Supp.,"The utility installer is not compatible with Win98 installer engine. So, while the product might work in their lab. under Win98, the installer doesn't let you get there to find out. The software just won't install. And, since the drivers are not resident on the CD you can't even install it manually. This is why they tell you not to plug the card into the PCI slot first. I guess the drivers are buried somewhere in the code of the utility installer. The file that you download from their website (a supposed ""upgrade"") is actually the same version on the CD.Tech support is farmed out to a foreign country. These guys spoke english worse than any help desk I've run across. So, don't count on ANY T.S."
2,difficulty with this product,"I am yet to get this thing to work. I have been trouble shooting for a couple of weeks now. The description seemed straight forward but this thing is not straightforward. It's 2008, it seems that technology should be advanced enough for things like this to work with minimal effort. Now I have to find tech guy to get this thing working and that service will cost more than the product!"
3,Works with Vista Home Premium,The TRENDnet TEW 443PI product description states that its compatible with Windows 98SE/ME/2000/XP....but it also works well with VISTA Home Premium....I did not install the CD...the system detected on it own and installation was a breeze...got it for 9.99 after rebates!
1,Burned out after three weeks.,"This bulb gave off nice light and the larger bulb globe was nice, but the bulb burned out after less than a month of use. Look for another brand."
1,3rd time MIGHT have been a charm?,"I received this box set for Christmas 2011. The 1st copy failed to play the last 2 episodes on Disc 3, & froze before the end of the 3rd to the last episode on the same disc. Tried 2 different DVD players & computer, nothing worked. I returned it, & was shafted on 1/2 of the return postage charge. When I received the replacement, this time Disc 3 was missing COMPLETELY! Returned it via a live conversation with an Amazon customer service rep & requested a THIRD copy. All they did was credit the gift-givers account, so she got me a new Christmas present at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, & I'm happy with that! Because I was thoroughly enjoying this series, I would STILL like to see the rest of it & own the boxed set, but am really reluctant to get it through Amazon again. I do have to say this is the first time Amazon has ever failed me. Bad batch of product from the manufacturer?"
1,wasted my money,I absolutely do NOT like this series.... too hard to follow... don't care for the actors - just not an easy piece to watch... totally disappointe.... Another donation for the Friends of the Library sale.
1,all bbc shows,"How is it there is no subtitles for the bbc series. We the hearing impaired have a hard enough time hearing the actors as it is, add the british accent forget it we are totally lost. Having the subtitles will have people with this handicap purchase more bbc series. Thanks!"
4,very informative,"The BBC do costume dramas so very well and this one is pure BBC, the history is well researched and it is an excellent lead to the Six Wives of Henry VIII and Elizabeth R."
5,Don't Read This Review!!,"Too late! But just to humour you... The Wisdom and Guidance of ""Bob"" dwarfs that of the Dalai Lama, the Oracle of Delphi, even Alex Trebek... so they had to fit it into TWO average sized texts. ""The World's 1st Industrial Religion"" is a following for those who follow no one (see?), a raging satire of cults in general. If your library includes such texts as Principia Discordia & Illuminatus!, the SubGenius texts would be perfect additions... but don't pretend to understand it. Only through ""Bob"" can one attain SLACK!"
1,Boring - too repetitious,"This workout is really boring. Maybe I'm spoiled by Christi's previous ""it-takes-a-month-to-learn-the-steps"" workouts. Christi ""takes it from the top"" so many times I finally gave up and started improvising. It you want an easy-to-learn step routine and challenging core workout - give this one a try. But if you want a challenging step routine, try something else."
1,NO GOOD,"MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS DVD, THE ONLY ONE THAT IS MESSED UP, IT DOES NOT WORK.SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH IT. I JUST SHOULD HAVE THROWN OUT MY MONEY FROM MY WINDOW, WHILE I WAS DRIVING MY CAR, AT LEAST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH WASTING IT, THAN FINDING OUT, I WASTED IT ON SOMETHING THAT IS NOT WORKING.AT LEAST THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE'S LUNCH MONEY............"
3,Not so great.,The stars are too big for my taste and look a bit tacky and gaudy. There is also a sauter mark on one of the upper stars that makes them look kinda cheap.
5,Hell Yea Baby !,"This is Exactly the real deal@ Daytona Bike Week. Great Coleslaw action. Great Bar Babe action. Outhouse races,Wet Tee shirts,No Tee Shirts! If you like Bikes Boobs & Beer.....this is for you! Rock on!"
1,Not a quality product,"Even though this product is sold as new and it looks good but the product is defective because it is out of round. Therfore, this caused the bead sealing area not seat properly on the rim sealing area on the rim. I purchased two of these tires, I install one and decided not to install the other. I would not purchase from this source again.Sincerely,"
5,Beautiful,"This is the first (and only) ""classical"" CD I've ever bought, and it hasn't let me down yet. I bought this CD primarily because of ""Moonlight Sonata"", but listening to the rest of the CD, I found that the different pieces really flow well throughout the CD."
1,Funny,Don't bother its not worth the 1.50. If you just want to see what happened back in the day then get it the one for 50.00 is probably the one you really want to purchase
1,Book review on double helix,"Double HelixThis book was an okay book. It is the story of Eli Samuels who is graduating out of high school and gets hired at Wyatt Transgenics by Dr. Quincy Wyatt. Dr. Wyatt seems to be paying special attention to this Eli. Meanwhile Eli's father has a bitter dislike for Dr. Wyatt although he won't tell Ely why. Eli suspects it has something to do with his mother, who is suffering from Huntington disease. This book is a mystery of Wyatt Transgenics and Dr. Quincy Wyatt. Follow Eli as he searches through his family's past to find out what the hatred for Dr. Wyatt was and why he is taking special interest in Eli. This book is full of relationships in the character's life and scientific mysteries."
2,Could Have Been Better,"First of all let me say that I am not the target audience of this book, as I am a very well educated middle aged man who is very Transhumanist in my views.Maybe this book appeals more to teen agers, but I found that the book wallowed way too much in teenage angst. Often I found the characters behaving in unrealistic ways. The main character seemed to obsess repeatedly about the same issues. I also found that the subject matter was handled in a way that was too conservative and narrow minded for my taste."
4,great read!,"Double Helix was very entertaining, suspenseful, and...real. I felt connected to the characters and enjoyed reading it the whole way through. It had a lot of interesting twists, and I just could not stop reading it. It is a great book teens--both boys & girls."
5,"Fantastic, catchy, wonderful Euro Pop! I LOVE IT!!","Musica 1.0 is a fantastic EP from a new artist who I hope gets discovered and gets lots tons of airplay -- David Rose. David's voice is simply awesome! The music is uplifting, catchy, memorable -- I find myself humming it all day long and playing it over and over. This is Euro Pop at its best!My favorite song is ""Per Elise (Classic Redux)"", but I love all the variants and all the songs on this EP. ""Laura No Esta (Laura's Remix)"" is another fabulous hit.David is at his best singing in Italian, but the music is very accessible to everyone -- everyone I've played this for has LOVED it.Anyway, do yourself a favor and try this outstanding new artist!"
5,International discovery!,"This is an awesome CD single with songs in Italian, Spanish, and English. You don't need to know the language to enjoy David Rose's wonderful arrangements or great voice. There are several versions of ""Per Elisa,"" each fitting a different mood, but all equally fantastic. I found myself singing it throughout the day. The same is true of the other tracks. ""Vamos a Bailar"" is a great dance hit waiting to happen and ""Laura No Esta"" is an upbeat ballad that showcases his versatility as a vocalist. I hope Amazon adds snippets to the site soon so you can hear what I mean. All three songs are modern covers of European pop favorites from the last three decades. I hope that music lovers around the world find David Rose and that he does a full length album."
2,The worst in the series.,"""The 60'S: Mods & Hippies"" was worse than it preceding books, ""The 40'S & 50's: Utility to New Look,"" ""The 20s & 30s: Flapper & Vamps,"" ""1900-02: Linen & Lace."" As with the ""The 40'S & 50's: Utility to New Look,"" this book focused more on the changes America faced, then with the fashion changes. I do not recommend."
2,Boring...,Williams once again shows how fast his fingers go with nothing happening musically. I have a few recordings by Williams and they stay on the bottom of the stack. You can get equally astonishing performances by Pepe Romero with musicality behind them and have something to enjoy as well as something to marvel at.
1,"'ultra thin' mousepad, moves too much","Sadly, this mousepad moves around beneath my mouse/hand too much. I can't recommend it.Typical mouse pads are a few milimeters thick foam, and the weight and texture of the foam keeps it stationary. This mouse pad is a thin sheet of hard plastic. It's about as thick as a few sheets of paper. The backing does have a 'tacky' surface that's supposed to keep it in one spot. Sadly, it doesn't work too well for me on a flat wood desk. Perhaps it would work better on something ultra-smooth like glass. Perhaps not. I prefer regular foamy mouse pads, even if they have one of these hard-pastic top layers."
2,Very pretty - not very practical,I should know better than to buy a mousepad without seeing it. the pad may have worked very well if I had a roller-ball mouse. But with the infra-red mice this thing is useless. The surface doesn't allow the mouse movement to be tracked properly. I bought 2 (one for my office and one for home) and it was very foolish.
1,What a Waste,"I was looking for a new mouse pad that doesn't slip and slide. This one was advertised as having an, and I am not making this up, ""Exclusive Non-Slip Backing."" What a joke. This thing slips and slides all over the place. I have a basic wood desktop, so I don't think it was unreasonable to expect it to perform as advertised. Do not buy this. It may look good on line, but the functionality is pathetic."
1,"Flimsy, thin, easily damaged","I bought this because I liked the picture. However, after a very short time of usage (maybe one or two months of, albeit, heavy usage) the pad tore from wear. The thing is flimsy as heck. I've already replaced it with something a tad more sturdy."
1,Lose curser with fast movement,I have an optical mouse and it did'nt work well with this pad.Moderatly fast movement would cause the curser to move erradicatly.My mouse works fine with my old Fellows pad.
2,I don't like it,"The picture s beautiful, but the product itself is cheaply made and feels scratchy. Had to purchase another that was softer."
2,Disappointed Customer,"While the mouse pad is quite pretty, it also slides on the table, and has to be tacked down. The surface of the mousepad is slick, and the mouse doesn't work well on it."
4,Very pretty....and works well.,"This item came quick and on time, with no issues at all. It is VERY thin, I do a lot of shipping through FedEx and would say it is no thicker than the clear plastic covering they have when you bind documents into a book. So if you are looking for a sleek thin look, then this is PERFECT! My desk that I have my computer on is a glass top table, and I would have given this item 5 stars (because it is beautiful!) but it slides around a bit when you move the mouse. So a little double sided tape fixed it and now it works perfect. The backing does have a ""no slide"" texture to it, but on a glass table it isn't enough. I am sure with a wooden surface it would stay put. I WOULD recommend this item as a gift or for yourself, like I said it is VERY pretty, VERY thin, and nearly got a 5 star rating!! :)"
3,A story from the depths of the Earth,"I have just finished reading Dust from Charles Pellegrino where the death of insects heralds the end of the human race. Here, the appearance of a new kind of insect might do the same. Entomologist irony.The relation between the excentric scientist (James Parmiter) and the bugs was very well developed. I wish that the author would have explored more the properties of the bacteria which supposedly gives intelligence to the roaches. The story is short and was made into a movie, which I did not see, yet.I would have liked to give this book 3 and a half stars but since the rating system is limited, I will settle for three."
3,Good book!,"I like the books in the NMS clinical series. Of course, they are not review book for USMLE but if you used them during your clerkship they are extremely useful to have handy. Psychiatric emergencies chapter has some lacunae; hopefully they will be corrected in the next edition."
5,The legend lives on,"After reading this book, it is no surprise that the Big B continues to be the greatest living legend in the Indian film industry. The book captures fascinating behind the scenes of the man who continues to demonstrate great persistence and tenacity in every film. His commitment has raised the bar for every new comer!"
2,Mini Edition may not be the best choice,"This book was suggested reference material for a college course of study at FIDM. Initially I thought this was a paperback condensed version of the hardback book. Upon receipt I found it extremely difficult to read without a magnifying glass - the print is literally micro-small. At first I blamed my aging eyes, but my nineteen year-old daughter whom I purchased the book for has 20/20 vision, and she expressed a similar opinion. I would not recommend this version of the book - if you have the option, purchase the full size hard bound copy."
4,Brilliant and well presented overview !,"Really great !! Enjoyable and well presented overview of designers, fashion icons, editors, and personalities of the last two centuries - valuable purchase !"
2,Oversimplification that ignores so many factors,"If you like the simplistic ivory-tower American view of the world then this is the book for you. If you want the far more complex truth then don't waste your time with this book. I received this book from a college student and was shocked that this passed as scholarly writing. I understood the dumbed-down level of the book once I saw the author writes articles for WIRED magazine and also cashed in by writing a biography about a distant relative. There are many great books available about the developing world, but this is not one of them."
3,"Nice look, runs wel but the pump is sad","I have owned three of these in the past four years. I have White's Tree Frogs and they LOVE the ability to sit in the running water. Also, It allows the water for the frogs to not go stale. The two biggest problems I have with it are the sub-par pump that inevitably burns out or needs to be constantly cleaned to keep operating, and the hose that connects the pump to the waterfall doesn't seal in place, so leakage is always an issue."
1,Great before it started leaking...,We bought this for our son's Crested Gecko about a month ago. I noticed it was going through water very quickly. Then I pulled it out one day and discovered the flood at the bottom of the terrarium. It seems to have sprung a small leak and as a result it's now pretty useless to us. Very disappointing.
3,Wenger Women's Watch,"Watch was beautiful, but I should've researched the dimensions first. The face is far too small for my aging eyes. I guess I need to buy men's watches or large-faced women's watches. I wonder if this one come's in a men's size or version, I would order it again!"
5,fantastic mermaids border,"I really liked the book, and wish it was available on CDrom. If it was I would certainly buy it.P.S. If anyone knows where to get a gif of the mermaid border please email me"
2,James,"Ordered a sofa which is listed as 86"" long and received a sofa that is 82 1/2"" long. Sofa was received wrapped in a clear plastic and not boxed. We had not way of returning it to the supplier.Over the next 30 days we wrote e-mails and made many phone calls and even talked to Coaster Furniture with no help. We told Coaster that we could use any size over 86"". Coaster said they had a new shipment coming in and they would get back to us. As of the date they have not called us back. In the end we have a sofa that is not what we wanted because it is to short and we will have to replace it. Over $1,250.00 for something we can't use."
3,Tomorrow's Gift - self-titled (Second Battle),"Originally released in 1970, as a 2-lp vinyl title - then later reissued as a single CD. Personally, I liked this album's follow-up 'Goodbye Future' (see my review) a bit better. Some of the songs here that show just what this German fusion band is capable of are ""Riddle Of The Swamp"", the eight-minute {upbeat} ""The First Seasons After The Destruction"", ""Gray Aurora"" and ""King Of A Nook"". Line-up: Ellen Meyer - vocals, Carlos Karges - guitar, Bernd Kiefer - bass, Wolfgang Trescher - flute, Manfred Runup - keyboards and Gerd Paetzke - drums. Might be tough to find unless you're willing to $pend some big bucks."
4,Equalizer Season One,I enjoyed watching the episodes that were included for season one. I wish I could purchase some of the following seasons. This series laid the ground work for the new series Leverage that is on TNT now. It is good to see the odds evened out in these episodes.
3,Great TV series,"Was filmed in New York City from 1985 to 1989. Lots of street footage that reflects New York City 25 years ago. His car was ahead of its time,,a Jaguar X16 4 door sports car. Show was very well done, an up grade from Kojak. This show makes better light of New York City than Kojak did. If you liked Kojak, Serpico and the French Connection then you will like The Equalizer."
4,Great- MORE PLEASE!,Woodward is so cool in The Equalizer. The main theme is great and the writing gives a wonderful feeling of Cold War/NYC paranoia.So where are the other seasons?! Is it some weird rights issue?Please release more- I WILL buy them.
5,Fan view of Equalizer,Received product in a timely manner and in excellent condition. Big fan of the show. Hope they will realse the other three seasons.
2,DVD's freeze up,"These are from Universal and they will lock up, freeze on one image and will not allow you to fast forward. There is also no scene selection, means when they lock up, you cannot see the remained of the episode. The same thing happens to A-Team and Night Rider, it is a Universal Studios problem. Reviewing the few episodes that I was able to watch, the slow has a very slow pace, the credits, establishing shots, stock footage last forever. Woodward talks tough alot, and glares at people, but there is very little action. They do the something exciting 20 minutes in and 10 minutes before the end ala Dukes of Hazard car chase. He always has two clients, one the main story, the other comic relief. I think the series got better after season one, but those are not available on DVD. But you could argue with lock up DVD, Series one is not truly available either."
3,Equalizing the Problem,The eighties were full of series.Mainly Miami Vice dominated this era but The Equalizer was a series for people who liked good old fashioned stories.An Ex Agent tries to help people in different dangerous situations.Edward Woodward was cool as ice as the main character.But be warned if you buy this set.As i researched mainly because of right problems the Music in this box differs from the original episodes.It was changed for this release.So if you are not a hard core fan this set is for you to go.If you are it's better to stay away and look for the R2 set which was released in Europe.
4,FAVORITE TV SHOW,SEASON ONE IS THE BEST OF THE SERIES. BRINGS BACK THE 'GOOD OLD DAYS'. WOODWARD IS A GREAT ACTOR WHO IS NOW DECEASED.
4,Great!!!!,really enjoyed the cd. Most of the songs have good beats and lyrics. Definitly recommend it!
4,Good Hip-hop infused R&B record,"An R&B album with a lot of urban Hip-Hop appeal. If you like Akon's sing-song style, this album is for you. He talks about more than just picking up women, that is just the club bangin' singlesw/ Slim Shady and Snoop. His album goes all over the place (sad to happy and every emotion in between) and seems 'real', not a formula type album. I'd recommend it."
1,Get rid of Da Rap,"If he could get rid of the gangsta stuff, and stick to R&B like in Dont Matter, I might like it......"
4,I like this CD,"I like all the songs on this CD except #10 (its a little too slow for my taste). A good amount of his songs have caribbean and african rhythms, which i love so i enjoy listening to this CD in my car and while im doing laundry :-). I gave it 4 starts only because i dont like song #10."
3,Decent Follow Up,"Let's face facts AKON is not A singer, in all honesty I don't what how to classify his music. He does produce some all right club tracks. The singles I Wanna Love You and Smack That are the only two tracks that stand out to me."
3,a very generous 3 stars,"best track ""gangsta bop"", akon should try to do different things instead making the whole album radio friendly!"
3,Fairly good follow-up to his debut (3.5 stars),"Firstly,like the others,I'm not a kid. Just that I don't have an Amazon account.There's really something interesting about Akon's whiny voice. You either really love it or really hate it. But to me,it's ok and it fits in with quite some of his songs and adds a special touch to it.His second single ""I Wanna Love You"" is already beginning to grow on me. Smack That is a catchy hip hop tune that will sure turn you up. Besides that,notable tracks are Gangsta Bop which Akon really does the perfect job. Tired Of Runnin is also one heartfelt song by Akon which really touches me. Of course,some songs do not really interest me,but I shall stop here :)"
5,5 Star Masterpiece,"This album is a masterpiece from the opening song to the closing. Im not a rap fan what so ever but have liked Akon since I heard Bonzana, Thats when I got my first real taste of him, Konvicted will flat out blow your doors off if you like talent. Do yourself a favor and get it!"
3,It's ok,"I love the songs Smack That and I Want To Love You. Other than those, the cd is ok. I knew Locked Up wouldn't be on the cd, but it would have been that much cooler if it was. It's got the explicit lyrics, so beware. It's a good beat, but just ok cd."
1,NOT SURE,"I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT BUT DID NOT RECEIVE DUE TO THE FACT THAT I ORDERED THE WRONG VERSION. I ORDERED THE EXPLICIT VERSION WHEN I WANTED THE CLEAN VERSION.SO THEREFORE, I REALLY CANT GIVE A REVIEW ON THIS ALBUM.THANK YOU"
3,A few very good songs but very explicit lyrics,A few of the songs on this CD are terrific but a few are not. Don't listen to this around your kids because many of the lyrics are very explicit.
4,"second LP from Akon , is way better than his first","This album is pretty good , Akon got mature , his music has improved since his ist release, also the guest appereances are great, from EM to Snoop dogg to Style p . Buy this album now"
5,Awesome album - Exceeded expectations,"The amazing thing about Akon's album is that my mother and I both can enjoy his music. I purchased the edited version of the album so I don't have the problem with the profanity usage. The collaborations with Snoop Dogg and Eminem are blockbuster hits. Akon like Timbaland are in high demand these days and I recently enjoyed Akon's collaboration of ""Sweet Escape"" on Gwen Stefani's new album. I did not think that he would be able to match the genius of songs like ""Locked up"", ""Lonely"" and ""Pot of Gold"" but he surpassed my expectations. Some reviewers commented about his voice being whiny but it is the uniqueness of his vocals which make him a hot commodity like Nate Dogg used to be for gangsta rap. Great album! Definitely one of the best of 2006 like Nelly Furtado, Justin Timberlake, Ludacris, Chingy, Lemar, Robin Thicke and Christina Aguilera."
2,konvict out on bail...just,"again, not a kid but dont have an amazon account.not typically being into this music i only heard of akon before with the goddamn awful ""lonely"" song that polluted the airwaves when it first came out. thankfully i was able to give the dude another chance as a friend of mine has taken me to a few clubs recently and i have to admit, ""i wanna love you"" and ""smack that"" are killer tunes...the only problem being, that when akon flys solo he is a bit hit or miss. the only other track i like on this album is ""mama africa"" which is a cool reggae song. for the most part, this is boring, mid-tempo with nothing standout at all bar the aforementioned tracks."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I have to admit, the singles that have come off this disc were the only songs I liked on the CD. Except, the singles that came off this disc, weren't necessarily the songs on the disc. I was highly disappointed to find that ""I wanna love you"" is NOT the actual song. Even though that is the way it is printed on the back of the disc. My daughter loves this song when it comes on the radio, but I can't listen to the real song with her around. To be honest, I don't even like the uncensored version."
5,Doctor Recommended,This product was recommended by my primary care physician because a study has shown that Red Yeast Rice lowered cholesterol and I don't tolerate statins.
1,Red Yeast Rice,I won't know if this product works until I have my cholesterol tested. I have used this type of product from other manufacturers and it works for cholesterol reduction.
4,Direct from the darkest recesses of the human experience,"Bare Bone 5, is just what it purports to be, the bare bones of reality. The skeletons of humanity ripped from there flesh and forced to parade about naked for all to see. It is at once beautiful and frightening. Direct from the darkest recesses of the human experience, these demons are dragged out kicking and screaming, brought into the light and made to dance and sing for our amusement and horror.BB 5, is at it's bones it's a collection of stories and poems in the realm psychological horror. As opposed to gore which grabs your gut, BB 5 grabs your brain and carries it off as spoils of war. The works contain elements of humor, classic horror, sci fi and surrealism, and yet it all revolves around this tightly packed BAM experience. Meant to jolt you and leave you lying awake in bed, paranoid delusions dancing through your mind. Well mission accomplished, I may never sleep again.Howl with the raw dog screaming!"
3,"Good album, needs recording work...","This was a pretty cool album. It just needed some recording work. Most of the songs need to be played on a big system to really sound how they were intended to sound. Plus, the vocals are a bit restrained. The future is much more intense.The new stuff is a lot better. A new album should be out soon."
2,Patrick Adams At Work,"This album contains too many ""Rockford File Theme"" sounding songs, with little variation across the lp. Along with Musique's albums, it suggests that highly praised Adams was notable more for his prolific output than consistent skill. At least this instrumental album spared listeners the junior-high lyrics of the Musique lp's. ""Disco Juice"" and ""Doin' It All Night"" stand apart from the dreck."
3,Racial bias story for young readers,"I'm a big fan of Mildred Taylor, but this one was not as strong as her others. The characterization was thin, so you never really cared what happened. I think it is written this way to make the segregation story available to younger students. This one would be fine for 3rd or 4th grade. If you want Mildred Taylor at her best, try a 7th-8th grade book, Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. For 9th grade and older, you can't go wrong with The Land."
2,A shiny new cadillac can cause troubble.,"The book 'The Golden Cadillac' genre is realistic fiction. It is about how a father sells his car for a Cadillac and wants to drive it to the south: From Ohio to Mississippi. The conflicts are that 1.) Wilma's and Lois' mother do not like the new car and was very upset. And also 2) for a black man to go to the south with a new shiny perfect car police think he stole it. The theme is both preparations because the dad knew of this of the warnings and trust because the family had to trust the Father on knowing what he was doing. Wilma's and Lois' Father get pulled over by a police officer and he has to spend the night in jail. There are two things We liked about this book 1) the father wasnt afraid of going to the Mississippi, 2) he didnt listen to what this family thought about going to the Mississippi.All kids would probably love reading this book."
3,The Gold Cadilallac (Cameron),"The Gold Cadillac is a good short book. Its aboat a girl and her family. One day her dad comes home with a brand new cadillac. They already had a new Mercury. The dad shows the cadillac to everyone and everyone likeed it except the mom. She did not like the car because they were saving for a new home. She did not ride in the golden Cadillac until the dad went to Missisipi, and nobody wanted him to go because it was a bad place for him. You've got to remember that this book takes place in the 1960's. He and the whole family went. If you want to know what happens,read The Gold Cadillac by Mildred D. Taylor."
1,BORING TO THE MAX,This book basically sucked. It was so boring cause liek there was a ton of talknig and no action or adventure or even fantasy or excitement or blah blah blah.
2,Bad razor,I really like the blades the only problem is the blades fall out of the razor.The spring loaded handle is not tight enough.It also acts like the design lacks plastic to hold blades.
2,Inconsistant shave,"I have had problems with the blades that came with this razor. Some are sharp and shave smooth, then the next one is very dull!! What kind of blades work in this razor? I like the razor, but it needs better more consistant blades. I will return it if I can't get better blades.Dave Baker"
4,Love this trilogy,"I love Adriana Trigiani's books. The Big Stone Gap books are delightfully funny, tearfully real and sentimental and exceptionally visual. Since the author is a screen writer, you can see her stories in film and television. I've passed these books to friends and family. If you are Italian American or love one, you'll appreciate these stories."
1,I still haven't received this book!!!,No Book!!! Why do I have to write 18 more words? I don't have the book!! Ridiculous! No more words to say...
4,Solid,"""Time Traveling Blues"" is a very solid hard rock album. There are no bad songs, but there are no mind-blowingly great songs either. It is true that Monster Magnet fans will be impressed and I think that the average fan of the Mighty Black Sabbath will find this a very good album as well. Some of the drumming sounds bad at first but really becomes cool with more listenings. You won't be disappointed with this one."
5,A vein running from the Netherworlds to Tony Iommi's left hand.,"The second release by Orange Goblin is the stuff of lore: Heavy, Mighty, Lumbering, Biting and Lecherous in it's ability to remove you from this present world and transport you to those ""darkest depths of Mordor"". The sound has most certainly come from the depths of a Netherworld that entered our time and space via Tony Iommi's left hand, Geezer Butler's thundering bass and Bill Ward's War Hammering. It forms a blade as true and sure as any Valyrian Steel used to play a game of thrones. This is assuredly Old World Heavy Metal at it's finest, nothing modern or flashy designed to sound like something but the real genuine article. ""Solarisphere"" and ""The Man Who Invented Time/Diesel (Phunt)"" are some of the best examples of the genre I've encountered since Side 2 of The Mob Rules""."
3,3.5 Stars,"A decent album from Orange Goblin, though it lacks some of the groove found on its predecessor, Frequencies From Planet Ten, and to some extent, the album suffers because of it. Songs get repetitive, with repeated heavy riffs. It's still a good album, but it just doesn't quite live up to the band's debut."
4,Apt Band Name,"On ""The Dreams Our Stuff is Made Of,"" Seattle quartet the Purrs debut with a nice, strong dose of psych-pop. Languid numbers spiral and unfurl into the air like smoke. The CD follows 2004's ""No Particular Bar, No Particular Town"" EP, which elicited comparisons to Echo and the Bunnymen, Galaxie 500, and the Verve. On their first full-length, they sound more like Love fronted by the Dream Syndicate's Steve Wynn. Promising stuff indeed, although Stima's uneven vocals do sometimes threaten to break the mood the band is so adept at setting."
5,Beautiful History of a Culture and a Relationship,"It takes a special talent to mesh the story of a vast and complex culture like horsebreeding with the even more complex interpersonal dramas shared by a father and son, but Sullivan pulls this off brilliantly. This book shows the promise that Sullivan will fulfill in his collection Pulphead. An excellent read!"
5,Thank you Mr. Sullivan,"If Sullivan were any better a writer he'd be illegal. Every sentence in this book is a tiny gem, every tale told a revelation. I learned more about racing, Kentucky, and the strange bonds of family then I had any right to expect for the cover price. And whatever Sullivan writes in the future, I'll be happy to have it in my library."
3,Lacks focus,"While well written and interesting in parts, this book suffers from a severe lack of focus. He tries to cover too many topics and winds up covering none of them well. I would suggest you pass this one up unless you find it really cheap."
2,Not about blood horses,"I didn't like this book. It's written by a member of the MTV generation with a short attention span. It's not about race horses--and he clearly didn't learn much about the industry--and it's not about his relationship with his father, although his writing of some descriptions can be effective. It's just a compendium of ideas pulled by his own jerky centrifugal force into his ambit as he worked on the book. What do paragraphs about the horrors inflicted on war horses have to do with the topic? He's a young liberal who likes to say nasty things about the people who provide jobs to others. Very misleading title."
1,Tossed this book in the garbage,"I read voraciously, and bought this one expecting a story about thorobred horse racing. Instead, I got a lot of whining from an obviously very insecure author. Except for 6-7 pages about Secretariat that were good, the rest of the book is a waste. My reaction to this author was: grow up and get a life. Tossed it into the garbage when I was done it was so bad I wouldn't even bother to pass it on to friends."
5,Tracing bloodline personally and through equines,"I first came across the article gleaned from the pages of this book (or in preperation of...) in a 2003 Harper's Magazine, October, I think. Mr.Sullivan's walk through the bizarre intricacies of the horse racing world from all sides, including his most personal, were raw genius. He nonchalantly drew connections between more humble pedigrees (his own, for example - nothing remarkable except that it, too, is now published) and those of these rarified creatures (thoroughbreds) in a way I didn't even notice until half way through. What a respctful tribute to his father. It seemed to me a sort of a come from behind type of writing style that crystalized into a fine read somewhere in the middle, and then just got better. All the way to the very last sentance."
5,An incredibly powerful book!,"After hearing the author read at a book signing at our local bookstore, I went home and started the book. I could not put it down! A beautifully written, powerful book written with scholarship, conviction and courage. If you have not found this book yet, you must! It is an exceptional read!"
3,Maybe,"I really thought I was getting more of a descriptive guidebook, rather than a photo book. Lots of pics but nothing to say about them."
3,Van Biggle Art Pottery,A liitle hard to use and slightly out of date. But a very good resource to start valueing your Van Briggle.
1,the collectors guide to van briggle art pottery: an identication and,I DIDN'T GET THE COLLECTORS GUIDE TO VAN BRIGGLE ART POTTERY!!I GOT A PIECE OF VAN BRIGGLE ART POTTERY FROM EBAY BUT NOT THE COLLECTORS GUIDE FROM AMAZON. THIS IS A CHRIGTMAS PRESENT THIS YEAR FROM ME TO MY DAUGHTER. WHAT IS WRONG? I HAVE THE ART POTTERY FROM EBAY BUT NOT THE COLLECTORS GUIDE--DO I HAVE TO USE ANOTHER VENDOR? PLEASE LET ME KNOW BEFORE CHRISTMAS!!
5,Buy The Realistic,Like the three Sankara stones in Temple of Doom my Spoon collection now glows with the addition of the Telephono LP and Soft Effects EP. Highly recommended.
2,Record Co Rip-Off !!!,"One question......Why is this issued as a 2 disc set? All the songs together only take up about 50 minutes, which means it would fit on one CD with 20+ minutes to spare. A way for the record company to jak the price up I guess. At any rate disc 1 is not as good as disc 2. The songs on disc 1 are very simplistic, and dont show much in the way of creativity or song writting. Disc 2 is much better, with better depth to the song writting itself. I am just being introduced to Spoon, & must say this offering isnt as impressive as a couple others........Worth a listen, but not much more......"
4,Rocking!,"This is the best work of Fish since Internal Exile. The only bad song is ""Jungle Ride"", but the rest is great. Jungle Ride begins quiet cool, but as soon the time has come for the refrain, I always skip the track. My favourite is ""Perseption of Jhonny P."" because of the great bass and Fish's great Scotish voice and ""Goldfish & Clowns""."
4,The man is back!,If you thought that after Internal Exile not much good came out of the mouth and hands of Derek Dick than listen to this CD. The man is back with avengance.
2,The Hogart Era Marillion Is Way Better Than This,"While this record is not totally horrible and is certainly of interest to Marilion fans, I tend to favor the current Marillion over the solo Fish stuff since the late 80's split. I think Marillion has finer musicianship than the players that Fish works with. This release has a few good songs, especially ""Goldfish And Clowns"" and ""Jungle Ride"" but is not really that essential. His songs have become overly wordy(not unlike solo Roger Waters), with a politically correct preachiness that I find urksome, especially the long (just plain long 8:37 ) and musically uninteresting ""The Perception Of Johnny Punter"",yuck; at least it's the first song and you can just start your CD player on track two easily enough. To me his best solo work was ""Vigil In A Wilderness Of Mirrors"". Now on the other hand there's this fellow named Steve Hogarth who's done some fine work with Marillion."
4,"A much ""hipper"" Fish.","After the horribly disappointing ""Suits"", it took me quite awhile before I could summon up the nerve to purchase this CD. Based on the strength of some of the songs I heard when I caught Fish live in the US, I decided to take a chance. I was glad I did. ""Sunsets On Empire"" is really a very good album that finds Fish taking on a new style of music and succeeding wonderfully. Gone are the overdone orchestral arrangements of his first solo album ""Vigil In A Wilderness Of Mirrors"" (a fine solo debut, but lately it's sounding very dated). This is a harder-edged guitar-oriented Fish, and--dare I speak the word--a much hipper Fish. Even though the old man's voice is noticeably weakening with time, he plays to his strengths and the overall vocal delivery comes off well. His follow-up release ""Raingods With Zippos"", while not quite as solid an album, is also worth the money."
4,Very tasty Fish,"Sunsets on Empire is a heck of an album from Marillion's former frontman and it is his best work so far in my opinion! Some good lyrics,nice tunes,especially the opener and Brother 52 and the title song! This album was produced by and stars the genius Steven Wilson.Wilson produced the album,plays guitar on several tracks and also keys on quite a few tracks,,seeing as how its Wilson you know it is gonna be top notch! Great sound,great songs,good vocals from Fish and of course excellent production!There is any accompaning dvd concert of this album however Steven Wilson (sadly) doesnt appear on it! Very nice album from the Fish! 4 stars!"
5,Great Stuff!,This is the BEST post-Marillion work that Fish has done. I think that all the songs are strong and Steve Wilson's influence is immense though not overstated. I would recommend this release to anyone who is sick of the current corporate trends and wants to support a guy who is creating intellectually honest music on his own.
5,pretty neat little tree,"This one hasn't bloomed yet so i cant speak for fruit or flowers. Like the previous reviews said, it would be helpful if they'd mention the species, as I'm left guessing for now... azalea maybe (?)Regardless, its doing well. I ordered this one and the juniper, and was a bit perturbed about the similarity (same pot, rocks, base etc...) Even 2 different color pots would have been cool, a little variety is nice.Otherwise, they're both pretty healthy plants, and I would certainly recommend the seller."
1,What kind of plant is this?,"Decent enough plant, nice small pot. It arrived alive and in good condition. But what the heck is it? Is it an evergreen? A flower? What? Update. Within 3 days the leaves dried up. They would stay on until you touched them. It was completely dead. I have many Bonzai, grow lights etc...just a bad plant."
3,"OK, not great",This book was okay but I prefer insight and lovingkindness meditation which I believe can still be Christian without all the religiosity of different demoninations.
3,hard,"it's a little too hard, so I put it in between my legs which works perfectly fine so at the end it's okay but I wouldn't use it to sleep on because if you do when you wake up in the morning your neck will be cramping."
3,Looking for the right pillow,"It does give you head support but it is kind of hard, still looking for the right pillow. Any suggestions."
1,Like sleeping on a rock,"I thought this pillow would be comparable to a tempurpedic pillow, but I was in for a surprise. This pillow was so dense that it was not comfortable at all. My head could not even sink into it and the foam didn't even conform to my head to allow support where it was needed. It was also very high and pushed my head upward which actually put more strain on my neck. Furthermore this pillow is very very heavy. Amazon offered a reimbursement for me as long as I paid the return shipping and handling, but that would've cost me more than I paid for the pillow itself. So now I am stuck with this paper weight of a pillow shoved in my closet, never to be used again."
3,Only okay for a tonsillectomy,"I bought this book for my nearly 3 year old daughter to help prep for her tonsillectomy. It was only okay, nothing wrong with it, but nothing that outstanding either. Maybe more for boys? It's also a hospital visit for a general injury. I found the other books (hospital visit sticker book and Goodbye Tonsils) more relevant for my daughter. We barely used this, would not buy again."
5,Great Book!,"I was very pleased with this book! My 3 year old son had his spleen taken out. By reading this book, it readied him for what was to happen for the most part in the hospital. Franklin is a character that he knows so we can reread the book now and talk about his feelings after his surgery compared to Franklin's."
5,excellent way to talk about getting sick and going to hospital,"This is a good book to talk about getting sick, seeing a doctor, taking x-ray and going to the hospital. Not a lot of words, but the pictures say it all. It describes how Franklin noticed a crack on his shell, then went to see the doctor and found out he needed a surgery. Then it shows him telling his friends about his upcoming surgery, then going to the hospital for admission, then to his private room, then surgery, recover..The most amazing part is how much detail it gets into. For example, Franklin has to go to the x-ray room by himself (he was allowed to take his stuff animal), with his parents waiting outside. Also before he went into surgery room, he had to say goodbye to his parents, etc."
4,Nice for 3 year olds too,"My son was going in for same day surgery, and this was a nice way to reiterate what we had already seen on our tour. The end part where the turtle is LEFT by his parents overnight probably can be omitted, but so can so many other things in books these days. Overall, a nice and non offending book, even for a family who doesn't normally use characters such as these in their normal book libary."
1,Where is the soundtrack???,"Beware! The Rhino DVD does not include the soundtrack. Let me qualify that statement; it has an incidental sound effects track, but not the dialogue track.I sent it back to Rhino, but they only sent along another silent copy. I asked them to check it out before they replaced it, but ...... I'm not going to ship back to Rhino; I already spent more than this turkey is worth and am not going to pay the shipping charges again.It's a shame as someone had done a great job on cleaning up the video-excellent clear and crisp visuals. A lot of effort for nought....a movie that appeals only to the lovers of bad films and rubber-suited monsters (you know who you are).If Rhino ever fixes their mistake, will someone please let me know?"
3,All the best.,"All the best from Hollywood;Heroic men,beautiful women in tight sweaters,a wise professor and rubber suited monsters all with a hip jazz score,what else do you want.Oh and not to mention,'boy meets girl' boy kills monster etc.Standard plot lines,some good acting,some not,but this movie was never intended to be an Oscar winner.Well worth the price and one of the more memorable 50s films,so if you like fun 50s movies you will like this one,but it ain't brain surgery!"
3,A definite front runner in the So-bad-it's-good category,"This movie is a loser, make no mistake about that. Some of the ""action"" scenes are obscured by fog it's literally impossible to see what's going on, but in this particular movie, that's a good thing. Not quite as hilariously inept as an Ed Wood or Coleman Francis film, it's best watched in an altered state with a bunch of like-minded friends."
3,Slime People,"Cheesy but good,..too bad the movie was shot with lots of fog...the costumes were great but the pictures were hard to see with the fog and the dark photography."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"About the only good thing about this movie is its drowsy effect! What an utterly boring movie. As a lover of B movies, I was expecting something remotely ""B"". This gets a ""B"" for making me sleepy. This silly little yarn is so tired and cheap. Sound good? Well, its not terribly fun to top it off. THe quality of the DVD is excellent however (I'll give ANY quality inexpensive DVD a star for that). If you buy this, you might be disappointed, but then again you didn't pay much for it. Neither did the filmmakers."
2,Disappointed,"I chose this tea based on customer reviews. This particular tea had quite a few positive reviews. Personally, I didn't think it was that great and now I'm stuck with 6 boxes of it."
5,Mmmm-Good Stuff,"Being a big fan of the tea served in Chinese restaurants I'm always on the lookout for different varieties of Oolong tea that come close to duplicating that same taste. I've recently purchased and tried both the Twinnings and Stash brands and I would have to say that I like this one just a little better than the Twinnings. (The Bigelow brand is also really good). This tea has a slightly more robust flavor and less of an aftertaste than Twinnings. It's still not quite as good as the tea they serve in the restaurants, but that may have something to do with the way the restaurants brew their tea or the ambiance in general. However, all things considered if you are looking for a really great tasting Oolong-this tea definitely satisfies."
4,the best tea,"This Ooling tea is not available in stores and is a wonderful, satisfying blend.It is interesting and soothing and does not need sugar to taste great.Highly recommended.Makes a great gift too and is well priced.Not as strong asEnglish breakfast tea and easier to sip after dinner!"
4,Good Tea!,I enjoy Chinese Oolong and this brand was new to me. It didn't disappoint. Smooth tea for anytime of the day.
5,I Love Stash's Premium China Oolong Tea,"I love the tart, fruity, smooth taste of Stash's Premium Oolong tea. I start every morning with a steaming cup of oolong tea. I feel very relaxed after my morning cup of oolong tea. I highly recommend Stash's Premium Oolong tea."
5,This cd blew me away,"I am old school hip hop at 45, but I really dig it when true skillz and flava bang from underground to my disc player. My hobby is finding good underground hip hop, jazz, house, lounge and this is one of my tops for the year. Being from Atlanta, I am glad to see some intelligent rhyme talent represent Dixie, rather than the shouting and chanting that has come to define Southern Rap. It would be nice if more young brothers and sisters could try and take it back to the roots of hip hop. This music is along the lines of Swamburger, People Under the Stairs, Jurrassic 5, Colossus, etc. Nice hooks, slamming beats intelligent and articulate.Jeffatl"
4,Good album!,"This is a great album for the soulful hiphop fans. Every track is consistent in sound with the next. The content is positive, which is a breath of fresh air based on all the negative stuff in hiphop we hear these days. The only thing i can nit pick is that some of the songs start to sound the same and the beats get a lil repetetive. however, thats only if you listen to the album over and over again (which i have). bottom line, this album gets play in my player for sure. get yours"
5,Thank you okayplayer,"Ok when i frist , got this album i did not know what to expect, but like the last viewer said, my taste of ,music is changing. this album is the best i have herd all year,once agian okayplayer as directed me to a good cd, and people who love hip hop music cope this album."
5,These kats are from the south?!?!?!?!?!?!,"Wow!!!!!!!!! I didn't think the south could produce artists like this. SFP are an absolutely amazing group. Multitalented members that sing as well as rap. Music like this breathes life into the lifeless body of hip hop. If you are looking for the current southern fad of crunk, you won't find it coming from this southern group. SFP along with Little Brother are definitely letting the world know that the south still has lyricists that can spit it raw and enlighten the listeners!"
3,Charpentier is not Charpentier,"This review refers to the MP3 download of this recording. These are two beautiful works, but the CD must be different from the MP3 downloads. I cannot review the Mozart Requiem, since I have not heard it. But the Charpentier Te Deum, on the MP3 download, is definitely not Charpentier's Te Deum. Rather, it is a set of guitar variations on Corelli's La Folia, a very common theme for variations through the ages. It's a well played set of variations, is an interesting composition, and the sound is good. Definitely worth the purchase price of less than one dollar. But it's mislabeled. I hesitate to give this only 3 stars, since the CD may be quite good. But listen to the samples before buying the MP3 version."
3,That sqeek in Kyrie!,"This is the only recording of the Mozart Requiem I've got so far--every time I have to play it to go over something, I can't help but to notice the violin sqeek in Kyrie--what a terrible break in the movement! Otherwise, a haunting performance of the Lacrymosa (not too slow), and a stunning performance of movements 3,5,7 (powerful cries of ""Rex!"" in Rex Tremendae), and a Te Deum with all the majestic beauty and angelic choral lines."
5,Transit Around The World in 1424 Days,I absolutley love my copy of Tranist Around The World in 1424 Days by Uwe Ommer. It's a greater book than I expected it would be. The photos and stories in it are amazing. Everyone should read this book. You can learn alot about how people around the world live.
5,Very quick shipper and excellent ship packaging.,I was pleasantly surprised how quickly this item arrived as it was before the expected receive date. Will order from this person again.
4,Excellent Field Manual,"Keys to Soil Taxonomy is an excellent field manual for identifying soil groups and strata. I will warn you however, that the terminology can be somewhat confusing without a good natural science glossary. This especially applies to individuals without degrees in soil science.This guide is fairly clear about how to combine terms to form appropriate soil labels. It is also excellent for providing a basic (or complex) understanding of soil formation and variants within soil groups."
3,Good,"I read the whole book and though it was interesting, it seemed like common sense. Doesn't hurt to read anything that might help with future decisions."
2,"Disappointing lack of new info over previous edition, too much reliance on home value","I was disappointed that not much new advice was offered over the previous edition. There is still too much reliance on the sale of one's home as a source of retirement assets--we all know how well that worked out in the last few years! I would have hoped to see some updating of the information, this was really a re-hash and not very valuable if you read the previous book."
2,"Some good points, but overly repetive.","The first time book mentions how Wall Street's ""70%-80% pre-retirement income"" recommendation is self-serving, it's interesting. By about the 10th mention, it's like ""OK. Got it. Let's move on.""Appreciated emphasis on importance of simplicity, freedom, and meaning, vs. sufficient means to sustain a bloated, materialistic lifestyle."
1,Received the wrong book,"I guess I won't be retiring on less than I think--for awhile anyway--as (after a very long wait, I might add) I received the wrong book! Which probably means there's another disappointed customer out there...SIGH.I did get a prompt refund, however--and I do appreciate that!"
5,finally,"Finally, a book on retirement that doesn't reflect the hype of the mutual fund industry. Also, the chapter on health care is the most cogent treatment of the subject I have read. A great gift for baby boomers."
5,The truth about retirement's cost,"As a writer of articles and a book on retirement finances, I think this book is excellent at teaching people there is a modest but pleasant way to retire within the finances many people have. He shows you how to stop wasting money and make the most of what you have. This is a great must read."
1,Brock's opinions might lead to your penury,If you followed Brock's advice on cutting unnecessary expenses then you probably shouldn't buy this book ($15). Mostly NY times op-ed filler with a few helpful web links. An example is the chapter on obtaining health insurance which is 90% a call to arms for nationalized health insurance and 10% practical advice. You can indeed consider retiring on less than you think if you believe the current government safety nets will be in place (and relatively unchanged) for the next 30 years and you are willing to live at a level that the government deems appropriate. I give the book one star for the included web links.
1,Political NOT practical,"If you can get past the author's jaded political views on the Canadian healthcare system and his rose colored view of Social Security's viability, you'll find not much more than a simple worksheet by which to calculate your post-retirement needs.The practical suggestions (there are some) are limited and at times obvious.....ie: Ignore Wall Street's rules of thumb on how much you'll need to live on. The rest is NY Times op-ed filler. What a shame.....he had the right idea...just didn't follow through."
1,"10% Valuable Information, 90% Propaganda","There are two helpful ideas in this book. Number 1, calculate your retirement needs yourself and don't rely on the ""experts"" that say you will need 80% of your pre-retirement income. Number 2, if you retire before 65 you will need health insurance, so shop for that wisely.Beyond that, the book is mostly a political rant. I'll spare you the details but a book like this is not the place for political campaigning.""Get a Life - You Don't Need a Million to Retire Well"" by Ralph Warner is a much better choice!"
1,Terrible book,The only advise I can give you if you follow the author's absurd advise is to make sure you keep a tin can handy so you can panhandle for you meals when you hit your seventies. What he basically does in give stories of people living on $1200 per month and are happy. I have lived on 18K a year and it sucked. Thanks but I will still be placing a chunk of money every two weeks in my 401K.
2,Not worth buying,"There is a little useful information in this book, but the main advice is to sell your home in an area where property values are very high and relocate to a less expensive area. This is repeated throughout the sections of the book. If you already live in one of the less-expensive areas and do not have a large house to sell,this advice is little help to you. The author advises things like buying a used car and driving it for many years; haven't most people figured this out on their own? There is a lot of filler in the form of stories about people who illustrate the author's view, many of whom are ""indulging their passion for bicycling"" in retirement."
2,A good idea gone awry.,"Guests at a posh hotel begin disappearing and draws the attention of a columnist (Michelle Green). Saying that the movie is predictable and routine would be an error. It is very original, it just doesn't go anywhere. And when it does go somewhere, it doesn't make any sense. The appearnaces of Louise Fletcher and James Brolin help, but overall the film is slow and incoherent. Horror and wierd stuff fans may up this a star, but others will not be so kind."
5,Another great made-for-tv movie not on DVD...,"Another great 90s made for tv thriller not released on DVD...What a shame. This is a great movie being it was made for tv. Louise Fletcher is spooky, and her acting is great. It has a great plot and story line to the movie. If they won't release it on DVD, you think they would at least show it again on cable."
2,Nurse Ratched Now Works at the Wessex Hotel!!,"As usual, there's too much everybody else, not enough Louise Fletcher. Everything is so mediocre about this film, but at last we get closure to that burning, unresolved question: what happened to Nurse Ratched after she got fired from the crazy house?Answer: She is now deep into a new, successful career in hospitality administration, managing a team of hotel employees and fulfilling important secretarial duties for Master Satan.Louise Fletcher's performance is THE reason to watch!"
4,A Rare Movie These Days!,"NIGHTMARE ON THE 13TH FLOOR is a great, television rarity. It managed to grab me and my mother through-out the entire time it was on. The acting is great, the sets are amazing and the suspense is hard on you! Walter Grauman is the director. Starring: Michele Greene, Louise Fletcher, James Brolin.A writer books into an old Victorian hotel. She is on the elevator when she is dropped off at the 13th floor. There, she witnesses a murder, goes unconcious and wakes up in front of staff. They tell her that she has dreamed all that has happened and that she will be okay. But when guests start to go missing, it's up to Elaine to prove that there is an existing 13th floor.I really guarantee that if you watch this film once, you'll want to watch it again. Really. One question, for all the Canadian peoples who reviewed this, where on earth did you manage to rent this film?"
4,Old-Fashioned Horror At Its Best!,"9/10""This means that Nightmare on the 13th Floor"" is a good movie especially for fans of the genre.Nightmare on the 13th Floor is a movie that remained with meafter I watched it on TV. The 13th Floor and James Brolin makethe movie devilishly good and wickedly scary. The acting isgood, although some people in the movie were amateur like KerryNoonan as Gale Myers. Michele Greene, James Brolin and JohnKarlen all show good spirit in their roles.This movie should not be missed and is very rare. So order ithere from Amazon.com like I did."
1,dont waste your money,"I bought this based on reviews. After 1 day of the water change, the water became chunky, looked like white pulp floatingand my fish became very inactive. Seemed like he stayed at the top trying to breathe. I went back to Aqueon betta bowl conditioner plus, I have had no trouble with burning the fish as prev reviews read. The fish store said the only way that happens is using to much water conditioner based on the volume of water."
4,Good product for certain tap waters.,"Ideally suited for treating soft tap water or deionized water. However, it can't soften your water or remove alkalinity. Even if you have a water softener in a hard water area, you will still have highly alkaline water, which can lead to fish kills. In such cases, use betta basics to buffer deionized water from the grocery store during your weekly water changes."
5,Diamond in the Rough,"I found Houpperts book on a dusty old shelf in a local Surplus store. I m not sure how it had gotten there, but upon reading a little into it I was sure it was worth the dollar it was selling for. I am one Chapter in and already she has changed my life. She provides astonishing information regarding tampons: what exactly is in them, what the industry hides, and what affects the secrets have had on womens lives. I promptly threw out all my tampons after finishing her first chapter! This book is not only for women, but those concerned with the environment, capitalism and how they all interconnect to make a horrifically clear picture of our socially accepted profit over people patterns. I found it for a dollar...you may not be so lucky...but there are somethings worth knowing that you can't put a price on."
1,post-humous,"Elvis is back from the grave, his vocal chords are decayed and there's dirt stuck in his ears."
5,This is It,"There is too much to say in praise of this very late (in Peter Hammill's career) album. It has verve, variety, volume, voraciousness and veracity. It has psychokillers, the life-inept, introspective parents and a 14 minute long meditation on the vastness and emptiness of Antarctica which is a very convincing evocation of the place. It is not one of his mellower albums, and more resembles ""X my Heart"" or ""Roaring Forties"" (both of which are also must-haves). I was worried that Hammill's age might have finally caught up with him when I bought this recording; I was very wrong. Age has brought experience and depth, not musical stagnation for him."
5,Lovin every bit of it!,"I just wanted to say that even thogh some of the endings in the Dark Elf books ended sadly, it compensates by giving me a world i can escape to when i'm down. I love Drizzt Do'Urden, and hope i see a lot more books come out about him and all his friends. One thing i would like to hear more about is Menzoberranzan and all the dark elves living there, and i would finally like to see Artemis Entreri be defeated once and for all (if this has already happened, please let me know so i can read about it). I must leave with these words: I love these books, and I'm lovin every bit of it!-Quentel Do'Urden~"
3,Wulfgars on the Front! Duuhh!,"Overall a good book but come on! u know whos in the abyss from the very start! Hmmm, Zaknefien's body is mush....WONDER WHO IT COULD BE?"
1,how frustrating!,For people who started the salvatore series late this book is a very frustrating book. Out of all his books which go in an order this one has been out of print for a year or two. It is a major hole in the series! I hate reading before and directly after. Forgotten Realms needs to quit daydreaming and reprint this book. Its ridiculous.
1,Boring.,"As much as I liked Salvatore's previous books, I cannot stand this one. The writing is insipid, and the story shallow and predictable.Irritatingly, Salvatore does not spend much time on detail- suggestive of a rush job -and as a result, action is glossed over and realism is compromised. This is one of the worst books I have ever read."
3,"Good action, fun book","Some good straightforward action that takes Drizzt back to his ""home"" in the Icewind Dale area to battle one of his older enemies.Not as sharp and smooth as some of the earlier Drizzt novels, but still a fun and fast read."
3,just like the halfling's gem,"passage to dwan was a good adventure on the sword coast just like the halfling's gem, without too much emphasis on the characters, and had it not been so predictable i would've liked it as much as THG, the best Drizzt book ever by far. Who gives a crap about Errtu? Who, in fact, gives a crap about any of drizzt's enemies when we all know drizzt always wins? Salvatore needs to do a better job of keeping us in suspense about HOW he wins, and not make it obvious that he will until the very end. Also he hasn't written a non-rushed ending since THG."
2,What was Salvatore thinking?,"I followed the Drizzt saga avidly until this book. This book, however, annoyed me to no end.Note to Salvatore: FORGONE CONCLUSIONS ARE NOT ENTERTAINING! You can't help but get the feeling throughout this entire book that Drizzt is a godlike figure, completely untouchable, and that therefore any attempt to oppose him is an exercise in futility. It doesn't help that his primary opponent in this book is a figure he soundly crushed years before. When you find yourself cheering on the villains and hoping they teach Drizzt a lesson, something just isn't right.After this book, I came to the conclusion that Drizzt was too powerful to be interesting. Weaknesses are what round out an interesting character; Drizzt has none I can see. He's quite simply untouchable in combat, and a complete saint outside of combat. Read the other Drizzt novels and skip this one."
3,Gadzooks! What in blazes happened?,"The reason this book mustered a 6 and not a 4 was the sea battle. other than that, this was simple pre-programmed writing. I was unimpressed, and found myself predicting a large amount of what was coming. Drizz't seemed to have really stepped down in his ability to enthrall the reader, not to mention simply fight the enemy. And bring the (I'll leave this blank incase you haven't read it) back to life??? Oh man, what a let down. Good character, but better death. I'm sorry for my poor review, but I'm honest in saying this book doesn't rate with Salavatore's others."
2,Wulfgar resurrection ruins series,"I loved the previous books, although the later ones were stretching the story on a bit much... but as soon as I read Passage to Dawn, I was quite disgusted. Way to ruin a good series... guess the money per book thing is clouding his vision."
1,Is the true Drizzt dead forever?,"If it wasn't for Drizzt this book would get zero stars. This is by far Salvatore's worst to date. The plot is lousy and predictable, and the ending is a horrible letdown.Problem number just supposed to turn into vapor with the reappearance of the lump o' lard barbarian? Sorry Salvatore, but you'll have to do better than that.."
2,Invincible characters and absurd resurrection ruins book,"I would have rated this book higher for sheer readability, but as longtime a Drizzt fan some things just bothered me too much. These super-characters are no longer believable. I will probably read the next Drizzt novel as well, but the summary already worries me. Artemis will be back again. Get some new characters, Salvatore! The Artemis/Drizzt rivalry should have been over when Drizzt finally defeated him (in the Legacy I believe). I thought bringing Artemis back in Starless Night was really pushing it, let alone having Artemis pop up again for yet another round with Drizzt. Drizzt is a great character, but future novels are desperately in need of some new material"
3,"Okay, not his best.","I got the book because it's about Drizzt, who is my favorite character, but the story was rather bad. It was not up to Salvatore's normal standards. It was much too predictable, particulary at the en"
3,Hugely Disappointing,"Having read, several times each, the preceding novels about my favorite character, Drizzt - and, indeed, virtually every other word Mr. Salvatore has committed to paper - the best I can say about ""Passage To Dawn"" is that it is about Drizzt. The plot is dreadful, with seemingly important events being brought up and then completely forgotten (e.g. why is Bruenor's returned eyesight never commented upon after the initial mention), with characters being dragged in from practically every other Forgotten Realms R.A. Salvatore book with little purpose, and with battle scenes that are stilted at best. I spent several worrisome nights wondering if Mr. Salvatore had died and if this book had been finished by a hack, so unlooked-for were some of the scenes. I can only hope that future works reflect more of Mr. Salvatore's previously humbling style and conception"
3,An interesting ending point of Salvatores two beloved chars,"I, unlike some of my peers, find it quite easy to criticize this book. Although throughout the beginning it met Salvatores usual standards, the end lacked a lot...like substance. I'm sorry, it just felt like ""Drizzt is in trouble...but, by god, he defeats everyone and everything is saved from this power that was going to destroy all of Faerun."" I believe this could be discredited to a deadline TSR put on Passage to Dawn.... If anyone else has been following Salvatores progress, it doesn't appear that any publisher can hols on to his talent for more than one series of books..latelty he's written for TSR, Warren, Ace, and others. Good book, bad ending"
2,The weakest of the lot.,"Ok, Drizzt's getting a bit tedious now. when's he gonna shut up and stop whining? heh. Anyway, I love the whole series, mostly. There are one or two things I dont like, most of them in this book. Why does anyone want Wulfgar back? He's the weakest of the characters. I think most people would have preferred it was Zaknafien. I knew, deep down inside that it was Wulfgar, but I never stopped hoping that it was good ol Zak instead. Ah well, cant win em all. Other than that, where's the plot?? The only thing I trully liked about this book was the fact that Cadderly was in it and I got to find out what happened to him after the Cleric Quintet. If your a die hard Drizzt fan, read it. If your not, and if your getting a little tired of the whole Drizzt thing, dont bother, it's not worth the disapointment."
3,"A fun read, but there's a big lack","I enjoyed it, but it left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth. Not a bad book though, but I'm sick of Errtu Where are Entreri and Jarlaxle? Hopefully Silent Blade will be much better (I have very few doubts about that). Although, Drizzt and friends are WAY too strong and they face too few worthy challenges. The story isn't THAT predictable, but it could have been so much better. Oh well."
4,Filling in the Blanks,"I loved this book! I bought it at lunch one day at work, and finished it that same night. The story did seem to move fast, and some details could have been elaborated on more, which is why I only give 4 stars. Salvatore tied up some loose strings, ""filling in the blanks."""
3,Salvatore can do better,"I've read every single book on Drizzt and even the creation of Guenwyhvar in Realms of Magic but this book is ridiculous.All the pre-empted stuff are in there as if it is another low-key movie sequel(no offense),still it is a book on Drizzt. Mr. Salvatore I think you should write about the 6 years in between and please introduce something fresh and new and can't Drizzt even get hurt a little anymore?"
3,Okay....But not his best work by far,"I have read all of R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt novels and I have noticed that in every book....The hero's become more and more invincable....I mean, When was the last time Drizzt got hurt? In the Halflings Gem. Bringing back Bruenor was one thing.."
4,Nice book,"The book was great, great story, not that much action as the last books but it lets you prepare for something more that should come"
4,"Slow start, but still a great addition to the saga","I'm a *huge* fan of the Legend of Drizzt series, but I'll admit, when I first started reading this book I became extremely bored about 1/4th of the way in and eventually took a break from reading it. I decided that after having read the first 9 books back-to-back, perhaps I just needed a bit of time away from the world of Drizzt, so I recently picked the book back up to give it another try. I was pleased that after a little break, the plot became much more immersive and I finished the entire book in just 2 or 3 sittings. As other reviewers have noted, this one doesn't have quite the same depth and page-turning appeal as previous installments, but its still an excellent novel with a fabulous action packed ending. Definitely don't skip this one, it contains essential plot lines which lead into the 11th book in the series ""The Silent Blade"" Overall rating, compared against the previous Drizzt books, B+"
5,Next great book in the series,"If you've made it this far in the Drizzt series, then you are committed. This book fits nicely within the continuing story. Great read."
4,"Finally, Drizzt gets out of the darkness","I was very much looking forward to Bob Salvatore's latest in the Drizzt series. But I absolutely was NOT looking forward to more hack and slash adventure in the dark caverns of the Underdark. Happily, Salvatore takes his hero on a journey worthy of an epic, on the surface world, interacting with other interesting characters. The sea battles were fascinating, the minions of the other planes interesting, and the overall theme splendid. Salvatore has grown up some as a writer, not content to merely slice his way through hordes of bad guys and provide phony philosophy to fill the pages. A most enjoyable read."
5,Despite the critics it's still a great book,Like always the battlescenes are excellent and the way Errtu builds up the tension in the book is great. I loved the expansion of the characters of Harkle Harpell and Robillard. I would really like to see Robilliard in a more in depth view in a later novel. The meeting of Drizzt and Cadderly was superb even though I didn't know anything about the Cleric Quintet. Also thankfully there were no more damn drow or Entreri to annoy the heros again. The final battle was superbly done even at least one of the heros should of died. Such as maybe Wulfgar again. I also would of liked to of seen Catti-Brie and Drizzt just do it already. I mean everyone is expecting them to anyways. But still overall a excellent book.
5,"A book of swords and magic, beautifully detailed.","R.A. Salvatore is one of the best contemporary fantasy authors, whose specialty are the detailed descriptions of battle scenes. ""Passage to Dawn"" groups Cadderly and his friends with Drizzt and his own companions in a long and perilous quest. This book is an excellent way to become familiar with all of Salvatore's main characters at Forgotten Realms. Find out what happened to the dark elf and to Catti-Brie after their leaving Mithril Hall. An adventure more dangerous than ever. A must read for all fantasy lovers or simply to escape our boring reality and land in a more active one!"
5,Great Book,"I liked the book.I have read every book concerning Drizzt and I thought they were all great. The first books I received were The Dark Elf Trilogy. I have to admit I wasn't big on books then and i put the book down numerous times on the first 50 pages. I just didn't find it interesting. Then I picked up the book again and I got really into it. The last book I read was Passage to Dawn, and I am patiently searching for the next book. I read Passage to Dawn the first time in under 24 hours I just couldn't put the book down."
3,"Good, but not as good as other Drizzt books","My comment is the same as everyone else's. Too predictable. Also I think that instead of resurrecting old characters, Salvatore should invent some new ones. That, as well as his excellent 'action writing' was always his strength.That being said, I would like to see some old plot lines tied up, or at least followed up on: namely, that elf-girl Drizzt saved who turned up again in Starless Night, and Jarlaxle, who was a complex character with strange motives (why help a rebel drow who can't reward you when your highest priorities are causing chaos, turning a profit, and looking out for number 1?)I agree with previous reviewers in that I'd like to see a solitary Drizzt again (or at least more Drizzt-focused novels). Over all, I felt that this book was nothing more than a long epilogue to The Legacy, and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't great either."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Oh, I'm sorry, I was still asleep after reading this snoozer. Definately not vintage Salvatore. But that's OK, Drizzt's getting a bit tired out anyway. I'm sure that by now Salvatore has to strap himself to the chair and force himself to write about him. Salvatore has what many fantasy writers of today lack - a real eye for simple story telling. I'll still take his worst offering (as this most surely is) over more prolific authors', such as Goodkind and Jordan, who in their contest for the most comparisons to Tolkein, create overloaded lands and well, lets face it, boring characters and plot. Salvatore is still one of the best, despite this relative setback. If you don't believe me, just pick up a copy of THE DEMON AWAKES."
3,The Gang is all here!,"If you are a fan of Salvador and Drizzt you will probably read this book no matter what I say. I hope you aren't as dissapointed as I was. Overall the book is good but in comparison to Salvadore's other novels it is a dissapointment.Drizzt and Cattibrie are already so well known as characters to us that Salvadore has run out of things to say about them. We learn nothing new about Drizzt or Cattibrie, instead we are lead through and endless stream of guest appearences. Ex: ""Hi, I'm Harkell Harper you may remember me from 'The Halflings Gem.'I was especially dissappointed with the Cadderly's appearence.As I said before you'll probably read it anyway if you are a big fan. I hope you aren't as dissapointed as I was."
4,"It may not be great literature, but it is a fun read.","Salvatore does it again. Not neccessarily his best effort, but it is still a page turning fun book. Some readers have accused Mr. Salvatore of resurrecting a character best left dead; however, he certainly left enough forshadowing in previous novels for a careful reader to forsee Lothe's gift to Errtu."
2,Not quite what I wanted...,There were perhaps some better choices among the available books. This one doesn't seem to have many original ideas (just variations of the same). I guess I should have expected that - it is a cookbook for one dish! :o) My mistake...
4,4 outta 5 ain't bad,"Macaroni & cheese has been my favorite comfort food for forever, so I was thrilled to buy this book when it came out. I've made about 5 of the recipes (multiple times) and all but one have been fabulous. I wanted to make Rocco DiSpirito's croquettes (pages 74-75) as part of my Thanksgiving dinner for tomorrow, but I could never get the mixture to form into balls no matter what I did. I added egg to a test batch, more mayo, more sour cream, some flour. Nothing worked. If anyone can figure out how to get these things to stick together, please email me at martha@terracepartners.com. While you're at it, if you happen to have any recipes for those divine little cheese croquettes they sell all over the south of Spain, send those along, too."
5,Raising Hope Rocks,"What's not to like? The cast is amazing, the writing is solid and without a laugh track it is funny as all get out. And if Burt isn't recognized for an Emmy next year, it's a sin."
5,Best and funniest sitcom I've ever seen!,I absolutely adore this show! It touches on the topics some shows won't touch while still maintaining its heart. I've watched Raising Hope many times now and always find something new I haven't noticed before. It's a creative comedy that most of us can actually relate to if we give it a chance. This show deserves to stay on the air for many years to come! I definitely recommend this show to my friends!
5,amazing,i really loved Raising hope season 1. it was so so funny i watched the whole season at least twice. i showed it to my fiiends and family and they liked it so muched i got them watching up to date tv shows of raising hope.
5,Raising crazy,Not the best sitcom but it has this little something ... and after the first episode you're already in love with that crazy family
3,Prose,"This is excellent prose in the King Arthur mythos about a knight of the round table named Sir Gawain. La Morte D'Arthur by the same publishing company is the standard all Arthur genre books are judged by. While not up to the level of Sir Thomas Malory's masterpiece, it's a worthwhile and short read. Recomended for prose enthusiasts past and present."
3,Where is it?,"I ordered this book weeks ago. I have not yet received it. I have had a couple of emails from Amazon (one saying they were having trouble locating it, another saying they located a copy but it would be a few weeks until I received it), but still no book."
2,Biggest myth: This book has a conservative slant,"I don't understand some of the reviews. Conservative slant? Give me a break. Read between the lines, folks! Boller does as much preaching as he does educating. There are some interesting tidbits here, but I expected much more.""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing""- Alexander Pope"
5,Excellent Conservative Book,"This was an excellent, concise, and well written book. The book shows many of the lies liberals have spit over the years to make us look bad. This book an many other explain why the right wing is right, and the left knows it. The book explains many historical truths, for example Jefferson never had an affair with a slave. It was mudslinging of his opponents.""Laissez Faire,""Chris... ."
2,One sided.,"I was disappointed in this book; the author cannot distance himself from his own bias. His history is fairy correct but he leans towards the left of most political situations and people, never quite obtaining a balance from both or more sides. I would hate to find this book in the school library under best history etc. or a 'must' read by some history teacher."
3,It's OK...but too derivative,"A friend of mine made me a copy, never got to hear it until today...It's very good music of you like Tool/Earshot/10 years, et al., you can see we're I am going with this, don't mean to be rude at all but in my opinion the frontman makes this band a watered down Tool...btw, $25 for the CD?? WOW! I can give you a free copy..."
4,Lovely read.,"I am raising heritage turkeys and this book captured so much of what comes with the job. Joe Hutto writes in lovely, flowing prose, but never flowery. He tells a great story without ever boring the reader. And the illustrations are wonderful. You don't need to know a thing about turkeys to enjoy this book. It's entertaining in its own way. If you love nature and all things wild, do yourself a favor...buy Illumination in the Flatwoods."
4,A. Wonderful window into the world of nature,The details of living in nature and dedication of the author toward the life's of these turkeys is heartwarming for our world.
5,Inspiring and Profound,"I was introduced to this book on 11/21/12 by watching the PBS Nature program called ""My Life as a Turkey"". Words cannot express how profound this program was and the book is written so beautifully. I envy the author's experience with these wild turkey's and I wish to thank him for sharing his unique perspective and journey with us."
5,Wild Turkeys,"Wild Turkeys...who gives them a second thought? This book gives everyone a glimpse into their complex and unique lives. Mr. Hutto does not waste time comparing them to humans, rather he finds himself re-discovering the world through their eyes. You can feel the emotion as Mr Hutto tries to put into words, what he is feeling and witnessing through his bond with these amazing animals. These birds live each day to the fullest without worrying about tomorrow. I came away believing completely that Mr. Hutto felt honoured to have been allowed into their secret world and he has come away with an experience he will never forget. These birds can teach us more about ourselves, than we will ever discover on our own. I would love to meet Mr. Hutto and share my own experience with these truly amazing creatures."
5,Beautifully written and wonderfully informative!,"After watching the enchanting PBS Nature special ""My Life as a Turkey"", I felt compelled to read this book. I had a personal interest because I've been feeding a small flock of wild turkeys in a wooded lot next to my house during the cold, snowy winter. That began when I started putting out water for them during the drought of summer so it was a natural progression. Joe Hutto's book has opened my eyes to some of the behaviors I observe as I watch the eleven turkeys each day from my window. As I read Joe's ""field notes"", I sometimes have to smile as he relates how close he feels to them and even dreams about them at night. My little flock has seven females and four males and they roost at the top of a cottonwood tree right outside. Joe's love for the turkeys that he fosters really resonates with me, because I love them too!"
4,Newest edition paperback has no color photograp,"I admit that I grinned and chuckled when a friend - whose taste I trust - offered to lend this book. Was she serious? She was indeed and and she was so right to urge me to give it a chance. It's wonderful. HOWEVER, the newest edition (2006) does not have the color photographs from the two earlier editions and that's a shame. You need to see Turkeyboy, et al. I'll be the only reviewer rating Illumination in the Flatwoods fewer than 5 stars and I hope this captures the attention of potential buyers. Get an older edition."
4,quite a delicious gift.,"I actually met Michael Mangia not so long ago, and through this meeting I came across this work of his. Quite surprised I was when I put it in. This album is not one that grows on you, but on the contrary, one that pleases the senses on first listen.There is something intimate, yet extremely extroverted expressed in this album. From the beautifully mellow ""Silent 45"" to the more complex ""Blueberry Boy."" The lyrics are strong, and such reminders of the work of Tori Amos, or even Fiona Apple are not to be missed."
5,Stunning...,Absolutely incredible. This man pulls in so many various emotions and raw power that you feel the tales he pulls you through. Incredibly introspective and unique. He takes the piano and makes it his. Great things loom ahead for this musician.
1,stupid documentary with OLD information!!!,Dumb! don't buy! It was aired on the Crime-TV cable channel back in 1996 and the information is very dated (by 2012 standards) - Don't waste your time or money on this one!
3,Meet Virgil Tibbs,"Virgil Tibbs became a household name with the making of the movie ""In the Heat of the Night"" starring Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier. In this novel Tibbs is a well respected detective in the Pasadena police department. When a nine-year-old boy takes his father's loaded gun to settle a score with another boy he is assigned the case. A few hours later after shooting at the boy's home and running away, Johnny is confronted by a group of black youths by whom he feels threatened. During a scuffle the gun is discharged and a black boy is dead. Tibbs, and his colleagues, is on full alert to find Johnny before the gun is used again. A fast paced and easy to read book."
2,"Not ""The Color Of Love""...But Ok.","This was an ok book. Not what I am used to from Sandra Brown, because it was hard to really believe that Dak was in love with Gayla and vice versa, due to so many conflicts and obstacles. I agree with the reader from Philadelphia that it takes talent to write an entirely different type of story each time--but this story was the furthest from her previous work that I have ever read. I can't wait to read her next book--not based on this one, but in hopes that it will be similar to The Color of Love."
2,Sandra Kitt is an excellent writer. I'm returning the book!,"I've read many of Kitt's books. This was an uninteresting story that left too many unanswered questions. Questions that continued to scream in my head. It became so upseting that I began scanning the book. Then finally, I gave up. This took all of about two hours. I hope I can find my receipt."
2,i expected better of ms. kitt,"The book could definitely have been better. I expected better of the author. I have read several of her other books and all of them were excellent. Color of Love was fantastic! And I picked up this book only because I was excited to read Ms. Kitt's latest novel, I didn't even read the back cover. Her latest effort was a disappointment but I'm sure her next one won't."
3,Midnight Reading,"This book was a page turner but only when I had nothing better to do. Those late nights when you can't sleep or you're looking for something to read in the bathtub, this is the book for you. Otherwise it's a dud. The sex scenes are not graphically descriptive at all. Ms. Kitt is capable of better."
4,Overcoming Hardknocks,"This may not have been one of my favorites from Sandra Kitt, but I still enjoyed the book. This was definitely one where you had to learn to love yourself before you can love someone else. Dak had to overcome alot of Hardknocks that was learned just from life!! I would give it a try."
2,Not Sandra Kitt's Best Work,"I've read other books by Sandra Kitt and have always liked her. This book doesn't even come close being as good as the other books Sandra Kitt has written (especially She's the One and The Color of Love). I felt that the story took way to long to unfold. The first half of the book seems to be devoted totally to not letting the story unfold. When things do finally start to happen it's toward the last third of the book. Once the story finally begins to move things seem to happen pretty quickly and events that should be devestating are wrapped up in just a few pages. I guess that is due to the characters in this book being amazingly resiliant and forgiving. Normally I would heartily recommend Sandra Kitt, but in the case of this book I say only read it if you are a devoted fan."
1,Disappointing,Not the style of writinig i'm used to from her. I'm sorry but I couldn't even finish this one. But do read her other books and see my reviews of them. She is a DYNAMIC Writer maybe just some bad luck with this one.
2,A suitable treatment for insomniacs.....,"Save your money on this one. It severly lacks the intensity of her previous efforts, which goes to show you that you can't be target all the time. Hopefully her next one will be on par of ""Siginificant Others, Between Friends, and the Color of Love."""
3,The book was a great disappointment to me.,The main characters lacked chemistry. They had nothimg in common other than sharing the same house at one point in their lives. I felt that there was great deal more romantic potential with the former lover Graham and or the current beau. I didn't feel close to this female character at all. It was hard to understand the attraction with the guy who grew up with her and her brother. I feel that Sandra could have expanding the story line. I really prefer her interacial romances a great deal better.
3,It Was Ok but not Recommendable,This book was Ok to read when you don't have anything better to do. The only reason why I gave it three stars was that it did have a good ending.
1,I wish I could give it a negative 5 stars...,"This game is very difficult and lengthy to program the remotes. Also, if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again. It's a huge waste of money. For 30.00 they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the DVD or have more than one DVD included in the game.This is a BIG disapointment."
1,Don't get the DVD version,"The DVD version of this game is terrible. Syncing up the buzzer remotes to the DVD player is a lengthy process. If successful, once synced the buzzers seem to be effective only half the time during game play. However, the biggest problem with the game is that if you play the game more than once, several of the questions repeat which makes repeat playing of the game unfun."
1,Only works sporadically,"This was a very disappointing Christmas gift for my daughter. We were able to return it, so we're happy with Amazon - but it's a bummer of a toy. The problem is that the controllers work so poorly - when you try to use them, you have to keep pressing the buttons over and over and over again to get the signal to register on the DVD player. A very frustrating experience. Not sure if something was wrong with our particular controllers, or if they all work that way.Another bad feature is that if your child wants to take the game to a friend's house - they have to spend 10 - 15 minutes reprogramming the controllers all over again to work on the friend's particular DVD player."
1,Not mad about Mad Gab but mad at Mad Gab.,"Our family has game night and we change who hosts the party. I purchased the Mad Gab DVD game and couldnt get the controllers to become compatible with the television. Both my sons, who are policemen and in their thirties also tried. We could get one to work and the nothing from the other. I ended up buying the old fashion card mad gab game. Which is a lot of fun."
2,Fun but dysfunctional,"I would have given this game 5 fun stars if both remotes worked. My kids actually played with it for a little while with only one working remote and enjoyed themselves. This is the second new game we've purchased, and both times the yellow remote didn't work. Customer service at Mattel sent us a new yellow remote free of charge and that remote didn't work either. I think we're going to have to stick with the card version of the game."
4,Great Costumes,"I was on Location with my Freind Under 6th street Bridge and at the Park In East Los Angeles, Thank you Stacie Logue, Very good wardrobe . I Loved the experience,T, From Santa Barbara"
4,change of heart,"I wrote a bad review of this product. Not the music, which is great, but the scratch. The seller was very prompt and offered a refund immediately.I was so impressed that I'm keeping it as the scratch in no way affects the sound. Plus the price was right.Medimops is a good company to do business with!"
5,This is building into a fantastic series.,"I can't say enough about how well these characters mesh, and how much I wish that they were brought to life on screen. Great work by Peter David!"
4,Improvement Over Previous Book,"I enjoyed this novel much more than than Martyr. The return of Robin Lefler's mother and the intrigue surrounbding her was very interesting. Morgan seems like she will play an important role in future books. What I didn't like about this novel was the continued soap opera qualities that other reviewers have alluded to. ***SPOILER*** First, why would most of the crew turn to a Vulcan for romantic advice? They mate only when they absolutely have to, and while they are capable of love, is it really the same as that of other humanoids? I don't think so. Second, Peter David continues to reduce some of the female members of the crew to starry-eyed, lovelorn teenage girls. It just doesn't fit with the overall character of the women, especially women in command. What I really enjoyed was the action-oriented plot. It was fast-paced and built to an amazing crescendo in the end. I look forward to reading more novels in the series."
3,"Good, more direct as other series.","Just read it, but you must like trek and not mind that there is a bit more erotic scent beneath the lines."
2,Sex Instead of a Story,"It looks like I'm not in the majority here, but I'll say it anyway. Both the newest ""New Frontier"" books-- Fire on High and Martyr-- are written more like Peyton Place (or Party of Five for younger folks) than a good Star Trek novel.If you like sex scenes and want to know who's sleeping with who or carrying who's baby (believe me it gets confusing in Fire on High), then by all means read this book. But these scenes took over the book in my opinion and any sort of Star Trek story or message was added, it seemed, as an after thought.These latest efforts in the New Frontier series do not deepen and expand the understanding of the Star Trek universe, they merely move it into pulp fiction. Where are we exposed to new scientific theories? Where is the interesting plot with twists and turns? There is no depth to any background explanations of the new species encountered here.Sorry, but I don't like this new direction.David Hess"
2,Lose the Mugato with the English accent,"The first four books of this series were great. Then Burgoyne humped everyone and a Mugato with an English accent saved the day. What started with promise has become disgusting. I will have to try book seven in November, but if things follow the trend of books five and six, I'm done with this series. It's a damn shame."
2,Star Trek is too sexual!,"I have read another person's review of Fire on High and Martyr and I agree both of those books are too darn sexual! Its too sexual for Star Trek! Now what, Picard having sex with Dr.Crusher, I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!"
2,An improvement over the dismal New Frontier novel: &#65533;Martyr',"This book is certainly better than `Martyr' the sexed up quasi religious mess that it was. I liked the Morgan Lefler character, she had a certain grit and earthy charm. The emotional strain between her and her estranged and embittered daughter Lt Robin Lefler was palpable.The ultimate super-weapon angle spoiled it. Especially when it's in the hands of an emaciated, deranged former travelling companion of Morgan Lefler. Who destroyed all life on the now barren planet she resides on..It had all the ingredients of typical `Trek' A god like race; the Prometheans who give `loaded guns to children' an immortal being, a strange energy creature endangering the Star-ship , a mysterious woman inexpliquably bonded to a superweapon, and a serious contravention of the Prime Directive. The trouble is Peter David over spices the mix and the result is not a palatable as it could have been, nonetheless a good effort."
5,Very SOLID,"A very god book. Better than book 5 (Martyr). The sex scenes finnally subsided here, unlike the last book. The seemingly stupid plot about Leflers mother, was yes stupid - BUT, Peter David spiced it up to keep you interested. I used this book to decide if I want to read the next one, and I most definetly will!!!"
3,New Frontier explores new grounds,"Peter David is attempting to set the New Frontier series apart from the other Star Trek categories by injecting some new elements.First, I enjoy how he has a continuing cycle through the books. Each book builds upon or touches upon events in the previous book. It is like reading a larger adventure. I prefer this as opposed to the done-in-one, stand alone Trek books I've read from Next Generation or Deep Space Nine.Second, the author realizes these are his characters to develop. He must give us looks at the entire crew. He does not have the luxury / constraint of a TV series to work within - it all has to be in the books.Third, he is realistically portraying what interactions might occur on a starship, especially with a younger crew. People are going to get involved with one another.Fourth, this series has had some of the funniest scenes I've read in books in a long time. The author often injects humor into his work and it seems to work well here."
5,bug killer,"last year was banner year for mosquitos and west nile virus in No Texas. The fogger gets smoke down in the shrubs where mosquitos live during daytime, one spraying and they are gone for 10 days or so,"
5,Overpopulation is more about attitude,"Rushdoony does it again. He explains that overpopulation is thousands of years old; our hunter & gatherer ancestors didn't have it easy at all - the game, more often than not, got away. Most of the book's some 60-pages details how socialism leads to food shortages because socialism robs the farmer (and other hard-workers) while rewarding the slacker, then blames the resulting economic problems (no money for food) on overpopulation.He offers a different perspective on plagues - they tend to happen in societies who have allowed themselves to become self-centered.Great book, but that's typical Rousas J. Rushdoony."
4,Good info - needs caution.,"Cass has done a great job of explaining how the natural supplement, St. John's Wort, can work to alleviate depression. A caution that I have is that not all St. John's Wort is made the same. Unless it is processed so that the finest hypericum is extracted, the molecules will be too big to cross into the membranes of the brain for the proper serotonin regulation. She explains the body's need and utilization of St. John's Wort in a comprehensive way. A link to this book would be the site iHerb which gives additional information about hypericum and offers a variety of products/dosages of the flower extract."
5,Helping Depression Naturally - You Really Can Do It!,"As the Alternative Health guru at Lifetips.com, I am constantly looking for books and products to share with visitors to my site that can help take the mystery or confusion out of alternative/natural healing. This is definitely one of those items.If you're looking for an easy-to-understand and well-researched book on a natural approach to dealing with depression, then this is the book for you. Dr. Cass shares case histories many might identify with and she has done her homework in deftly explaining the important factors one must understand to deal effectively with depression. She also provides great tips on nutritional steps and lifestyle changes that must go hand-in-hand if one is serious about defeating depression. This wonderful book CAN offer help to those struggling to get a handle on dealing with depression naturally."
3,Unhappy customer,"Got Epson 1250 photo. After 1 hr. on phone with tech. At my expense-no 800#- I found out it wouldn't work properly until I installed some program from internet, but still don't know how to do that. Took it back and got Canon 1250 photo. Canon has excellent tech support. AND TOLL FREE. I really planned to buy the Epson 1280 photo printer, but now I don't know."
2,"Dust, Dust, Dust","With all the hype about the image quality of Epson scanners, I was disappointed by the lack of quality that came from the one I just got. In short, there's dust under the glass, inside the scanner where it's unreachable, that I can see with the visible eye, and that is magnified in scanned images. Image quality would be excellent except there's dust specks all over the place on the images. Since consumers have complained of a similar dust problem with previous Epson scanners, I thought the company would fix it with this new model, but they didn't. In fact, quality control doesn't seem to have improved--there's even a fingerprint on the underside of the glass. I'm returning this one and getting a Cannon or HP instead."
5,Excellent High End Scanner for the inexpensive Buyer,"This is an incredible scanner, I am using it to make textures for 3D characters and 3D models for 3D Studio Max, with that in mind I was looking for a scanner that was high quality and inexpensive on the wallet (I am a student after all). To make textures for 3D characters you need a good scanner, needless to say, this scanner done the job incredibly. To demonstrate, I scanned in a picture of a face from a magazine, the scan came out so clear you could see the pores and facial skin texture. If you are a high end user -- 3D artist, texturer then don't shy away from this scanner. It's incredible, plus you will still have enough money left over to buy a 3D graphic book!"
2,This Scanner is SOOOO BAD!,"I've always been an epson fan, so when one of my friend told me that his epson scanner gives him problem, I thought it was just his scanner (one of those rare occasion). Unfortunately when I got this epson scanner (which is a little higer model than his), it had the exact same problems! At first this scanner seems great but only a couple months later, it tends to scan in wierd channel (like bright neon green, etc). The problem eventually goes away and pop back up again every once in a while. I have the scanner for over a year now (and trust me I don't use it THAT much). Suddenly, it scanned BLACK. The whole screen goes back. I know my connection is good, and it's the scanner. TECH SUPPORTS CHARGES YOU ...IN ADDITION TO THE PHONE BILL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A 1-800 NUMBER. I'm very upset.. and I'm about to throw out this scanner and go for somthing else like a UMAX, Canon, or HP."
4,Epson Perfection 1250,"This is my third scanner and is far the best, instructions are easy to read and the software is user friendly, I was enable to quickly and accurately enter text, photos and other printed material into my computer, and locate them easily at later dates. Epson Perfection 1250 is a great buy for the price."
2,UPSET CUSTOMER,"I've always been an epson fan, so when one of my friend told me that his epson scanner gives him problem, I thought it was just his scanner (one of those rare occasion). Unfortunately when I got this epson scanner (which is a little higer model than his), it had the exact same problems! At first this scanner seems great but only a couple months later, it tends to scan in wierd channel (like bright neon green, etc). The problem eventually goes away and pop back up again every once in a while. I have the scanner for over a year now (and trust me I don't use it THAT much). Suddenly, it scanned BLACK. The whole screen goes back. I know my connection is good, and it's the scanner. TECH SUPPORTS CHARGES YOU [money]IN ADDITION TO THE PHONE BILL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A 1-800 NUMBER. I'm very upset.. and I'm about to throw out this scanner and go for somthing else like a UMAX, Canon, or HP. IT IS A GREAT SCANNER.. BUT ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.. SADLY."
3,Two major problems with this scanner,"My first scanner was an Epson 600, but when I made the jump to Win2K, there was no driver for it so I bought the Epson Perfection 1250. Alas, it was not as good a scanner. The two main problems are:- The control panel pops up randomly, something for which there is no fix apparently.- After 10-15 minutes, the computer has to be rebooted to find the scanner if is has been inactive. If the scanner is unplugged to force a rescan of the USB port, the PC crashes.It is also very slow and the software that comes with it is not even close to being as good as the package that came with the 600.Other reviews cite an attachment that helps scan slides but, alas, that did not come with my scanner. On the other hand, the dust under the glass noted in other reviews has not been a problem."
3,too many problems,"First, it didn't work on my windows2000 at all.Second, Got it working on my windows98 machine, but ""copy"" button never works, it always gave error message, (ironically my printer is an Epson Stylus 640). The worse is, you have to reboot your machine after seeing that error msg, otherwise windows can't find the scanner. Never tried film scanning, going to return it."
1,Simply Awful!,"I bought and returned two of these honeys. Both were identical. They had dust under the glass, the colors looked like they came from a different spectrum, very noisy and s..l..o..w. Finally settled on the Canon N670U. 1000 percent better. It seems that a company that can make such excellent printers should be able to manufacture a decent scanner NOT! Save your money. Buy a Canon for less and go out to dinner on Epson with what you saved."
2,It Looked Nice Out of the Box,"The unit looks nice out of the box and the setup was easy. The slide scanner attachment worked well, but the flat bed scanner produces dark color bars over about one third of the scanned page and I can't figure how to get rid of them. The part of the page not effected by the color bars looked very nice, but I need a full page scanner not a two thirds page scanner. I'm going to return this unit and request another, if that doesn't work I'll go with a different brand. I'm surprised, I've always had good luck with Epson products. One star was for the unit design, the other for the slide scanner attachment."
3,Software not ready for XP,Initially installed 1250 with Windows ME. Software and drivers had no problem with Epson supplied software. Upgraded to XP and software and drivers were not compatible. Driver upgrade is available as of 1/6/02 but software upgrade (promised mid-December) is yet to be available for full compatibility with XP. When scanner is working it does a great job and if you have a slide of good quality the scan is good quality. Disappointed in Epson for not ensuring XP compatible software was available upon release of XP.
4,This was good!!!,"I got this book from my mom, who reads romances ALL the time (like three a week) and then gives the good ones to me! I like Jane Ann Krentz because her characters are different from the usual people, and interesting. I think this is a reprint of an old book, and some of her newer ones are better, but Sarah is a really sweet character, and I liked her a lot. Recommended!!!"
3,"fast moving, funny","This is one of Jayne's fast moving story. You can't just put it down until you finish. It may be a bit far from real life, but that's romance. Don't you think?"
5,One of Jayne's best!,"The Adventurer is a wonderful adventure. This is the second in Jayne's ""Ladies and Legends"" trilogy. The heroine is very independent. The hero is reluctant. What a combination. One of the things I liked best about this particular series is that the heroines are not twenty something but thirtysomething. Defintely a plus. If you've not read Jayne Ann Krentz before this is a book/trilogy to begin with."
1,No reviews coming through on this book,"I wrote a review on this book a couple months ago, but there have been no reviews published since December. I feel a duty to fellow JAK fans to tell them to SAVE THEIR MONEY.My dog shredded this awful book, after I had forced myself to finish it (only because it was a JAK book, and hoped it would get better). I wouldn't read the 3rd installment of this trilogy if someone paid me. My time is more valuable. I have been (until lately) a huge JAK fan (although I prefer her Amanda Quick stories). What in the world is happening? Yuck."
3,For girls only,"Being a Dad, I played this with my daughter. It is okay and a bit too long. I would see this game as a big hit with an all girl slumber party. The questions would spark a lot of debate with the girls! A nice way to put it!!It is neat how the center console works by just waving over it."
4,Homeostasis key to Osteoporosis,"Your bones are more than your calcium/magnesium balance. This book takes the mystery out of understanding why the body loses calcium and how we can reverse the problem without massive doses of minerals. The key is understanding how our diet and lifestyle damages our bodies efforts to stay in balance, homeostasis. I read the older edition of this book and maybe it has improved in the area of recipies and nutrition but the theory is great. If the new edition has the latest nutrition information about glyconutritionals and biochemical balance then I would up the grade to five stars."
1,Terrible,"Blah, no flavor. Tea made in India. What little flavor there is, isfake. very artificial. Thinking about it? Buy a box of Twinings andyou will thank me later."
2,Hit and Miss,"I received this as a gift because my wife and I are tea drinkers. As stated in other reviews, most of the teas in this set are extremely weak in flavor. What I even found more troublesome was that different packets of the same flavor of tea steeped different and were not consistent. Most of the time the tea tastes like hot water. The box the teas come in is nice looking but sorry to say is probably the best part of this package. My opinion, purchase tea from either Bigelow or Twinings teas. Both offer a wide variety of flavors that brew very well."
2,Empty tea bag,I ordered 4boxes for presents. one tea bag which is lemon tea was empty. Little bit disappointed.
2,Subpar Tea,"This tea is fine, but in my opinion flavor is lacking and when present tastes rather artificial. Better off with 12 high quality tea bags."
1,Terrible Tea,I've received a couple of gift boxes of Bentley's tea and it is truly some of the nastiest tasting tea I've ever had.
1,Nice Deal for Mediocre Tea,"Got this on special for $10.30 :-). At that price I can't complain. Presentation was nice. Tea is adequate, nothing to write home about. Yes, Twinnings or even Bigelow is better. Very flavored-Green-Tea oriented, and actually it only has 10 Earl Grey in there, not 20. So the selection is not really idea, when you consider how many interesting teas are in a Twinnings assortment (and EG is my favorite). Had I paid $36 I'd be giving it one star. Box is good, but not a neat hinged box like you get at a fancy restaurant. The wrappers are garish.I've lowered my rating because when I moved, I left the mostly full box behind."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I should have known that there was something fishy when the product details said that the product dimensions are 13 x 10.5 x 2.5 inches and 3.8 pounds when the shipping weight said 2.15 pounds. In actuality it is 12 X 10 X 2.5 and comes in a CHEAP (do not even know if it IS wood) box AND it weighs 1.14 pounds on my postal scale. However, to be fair, I have not taken the plastic wrapper off because it is a gift so it could be very, VERY thin wood. In addition, the container opens like a box rather than a chest. There are no hinges on the back. I am very disappointed with this tea ""chest"" AND it's price!"
4,Exactly as stated,"Haven't tried all the flavors yet, but those I've had are very good. I like the way they steep fairly quickly. Nice selection of tea flavors, the fruit ones have a natural taste.The box is nice, about what you'd expect in a tea box. Made of 1/4"" lath that is stained a dark brown. The stain chips easily, but then lath isn't a hard wood. I knocked the whole box off the dining table and got a small crack in one corner of the lid, I expected much worse damage. If you're buying to use the box for another purpose later, remember that it was only meant to hold tea."
1,Terrible Tea,"This has to be some of the worst tasting tea I have ever tried. It leaves my tongue with a somewhat raw feeling. The flavors must be all artificial and not natural,and there really isn't much of any flavor that can be tasted. If someone handed you a cup of tea it would be pretty hard to tell the flavor. Don't waste your money on this. You can get much better tea at Walmart that cost a lot less. The box the tea comes in is very cheap, and relly isn't worth anything.Jim"
3,You get a liberal left wing nut lecture on the insert,"Not once in my 4000 CDs ,and 2000 records before that have I had to endure a left wing liberal lecture before on the jacket. I like most real music lovers buy music to relax and escape world stress.Leave your stupid naive coments to the TV and newspapers .I almost sent this CD back because of it but because of a couple of good songs on here I just tore the page with the coments off and ripped it up."
3,Quality is mediocre,"Ordered two, both work fine but the quality of the chrome work is a little sub-par. It looks as though they were hand dipped. It is a little uneven, the chrome part is not exactly level to the side of the bulb. Like it was done with the bulb at a slight angle."
1,I wish I listened to the other reviews--these burn out immediately!,"I am such a fool for having purchased these. They are exactly what I needed (in theory) and I bought two of them, ignoring other reviewers claims that they were prone to quick burn-out. Being a single guy who lives on the edge, I threw the packaging away after two days thinking I'd take the risk that they'd be a.o.k. Alas! I used one for not 2 hours and it blew out on me. What a piece of crud!!!The other one still works but it's in a light I don't use much...so far about 3 total hours it's been on. I'm searching for alternatives but I'm super pissed as I oh-so wanted these to work."
2,Bought 3 One Blew as soon as I turned them on.,The bulbs that did not blow work great. The light reflects upward making the light easy on the eyes. Will order more but if anymore blow I will return them all.Bulbrite 100G25HM Half Chrome 100W Globe Shape Bulb
5,This is a funny movie,"A hilarious movie from Troma. It is about Satan who transforms him self into a busdriver so that he can get tourists to give him their souls. This movie is very funny. A great Troma release. If you like Troma, the Toxic Avenger, and Class of Nuke Em' High you will love this."
5,"fatty drives the bus in chicago and dies, fat i mean dies","This movie rules! Its about a ""cheapass"" bus tour of the great city of Chicago. But this is not just any tour, Satan is the tour guide!!!!! There are a lot of funny people in this movie, but my favorite has to be the beautiful and glamorous woman Bridget! The people in this movie are/were members of Chicago's Annoyance Improv-Theater. These guys are great. If your in to Troma then you need to see this movie!-knick"
4,Sharon seeks her roots,"When Sharon McCone's father dies, he leaves a request that Sharon be the one to go through his papers. When she does, she finds some shocking information about her past which plunges her into anger and disbelief and causes her to search for answers to questions she didn't know she needed to ask. Sharon has always known that she is part Shoshone Indian and her investigation brings her face to face with her Native American relatives. Greed, prejudice and corruption are all uncovered as Sharon seeks out her identity. Her lover Hy is at her side, as always, but the McCones oppose her quest. This book marks an interesting twist in the long-running Sharon McCone series, but watching Sharon try to solve her own mystery is not as intriguing as watching her solve other people's. Still, this is an important book for Marcia Muller fans."
1,Brillianc Audio,Watch out for Brilliance Audio books. You need a stereo with speakers you can separate to play left on one side of the tape and right on the other side. I did not have that so did not hear the story.
2,Mass Production,"Marcia Muller writes like somebody who has just accomplished a 3 week seminar on how to become a ""bestselling author"". This book is based on three ideas: The adopted child's search for its biological parents, a bit of Indian culture & history (esp. Shoshons) and, finally, the truth in the unspoken. Muller adds to this meat some ketchup (e.g. an unrealistically friendly friend Hy) and cheese. Sharon McCone, the protagonist, seems to know in advance what people try to hide from her. At the end of the 342 pages, what a surprise, she knows everything. Muller's prose is completely uninspired and uninspiring. Compared to the contemporary witty and intellectually rich European crime fiction (Henning Mankell, Maj Sjöwall, Per Wahlöö, Wolf Haas) this book is just boring mass production. My conclusion: No more Marcia Muller!"
5,A Fresh Side to Sharon McCone,"Sharon McCone doesn't just look like a Shoshone. She is one. Throughout this highly successful mystery series, Marcia Muller has run this continuing tread of her private detective possessing the appearance of a Shoshone ancestor. In Listen to the Silence, Muller reveals why. Sharon's father dies, and she discovers in his papers a truth that had been hidden from her all of her life. Seeking more of this truth, Sharon travels to the Shoshone reservation. There, she encounters deeply buried secrets and homicides that need to be solved. This book is my favorite McCone novel. I enjoyed the socio-cultural aspects of the mystery and as well as the plot. Muller's dialog is always first-rate. Listen to the Silence is a fine mystery novel by a terrific mystery author."
4,Sometimes I wish . . .,This is an excellent little story about a variation on time travel and how you might change the future through choices you were too afraid to make the first time around. I am no longer 15 on the outside. But I remember ...
3,Average B movie,"Not much to say about this movie, It is a b movie, not the worst and not the best. I guess fans of Mia Sara would get to enjoy her a bit. Anybody else just look for something else."
4,Lock Outlet for yard drainage,"The product doesn't look like what was pictured when I bought it, but it works fine. Project completed as needed."
1,Item was Not as Pictured ! Beware of substitutes !!!,"I desparately needed this NDS part to finish a drainage project that I had begun. I was happy that I found this product on Amazon and matched the picture and brand name shown to the actual parts in my hand. They matched, so I ordered it right away and began the project anticipating that this part would arrive just in time for me to finish the project. Well, what arrived was not this part as pictures but one that was similar and would work for some other projects but not mine. I did not want a substitute product. I wanted one exactly as pictured. I had to undo some of my drainage project and swap some other parts around to complete my project. In place of this product, I had to use duct tape. This product is still in the box. Yes, I could ship this 4 dollar part back and get my 4 dollars refunded but it would cost me three seventy-five to ship it. The price I paid was not the point. This substitute product cost me plenty in terms of extra work."
4,Excellent topic but eventually changing into a brochure,"The book starts on a very informative manner but eventually changes into a brochure for a nutritional product. The information is greatly needed by people suffering from low energy and related problems. Brochures should be send free of charge or be clearly indicated as such. Of the 48 pages, from pages 13 onwards is a straight brochure. The author succeeds to highlight the importance of a very much needed topic. The book ""Dreams for Fragile People"" by Steyn and Verwey (1998) also deals about the importance of NAD and energy related concepts. The topic of biochemical energy is extended to include the psychological, intellectual and spiritual value of energy to mankind in general. Both these books deals with information about NAD and the importance of this to the general public and more specific suffers from low energy and related disorders."
4,Nice trip down memory lane,"My dad grew up in the Twin Cities in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, so I thought that this would be a fun gift for his birthday.It took a little help to get him to see how the book operated (tracing an imaginary vertical line from the number at the edge of each photo), but once he got the hang of it, it was nostalgia time! He'd show me where he went to school, where he lived, where he worked, etc.He talked about buying some extra copies for his (many) siblings whom, he imagined, would probably enjoy it as much as he did.It was even fun to see places that I went to with him and his family (e.g., the Nankin Restaurant).I think there are other similar books out there, but this one seemed to have decent reviews and I'm glad that I got it for him.Oh, a slightly larger format would have made reviewing the book easier. Sometimes, the items in the photos were just too small to make out and had us longing for a magnifying glass."
2,Take what this book has to say with a grain of salt.,"The spiritual comments are marvellous, but the factual content is dodgy. Z. seems to think that a woman will always get her period at the same phase of the moon. But the typical 28-day menstrual cycle is *shorter* than the moon's cycle of 29 1/2 days, so it won't stay in step. (Besides, many women's cycles are a few days shorter or longer than the average.) Z. also says the Earth and Sun are getting closer together at the Northern Hemisphere's summer solstice; that's actually close to aphelion. (It's the tilt of the Earth's axis that causes the seasons, not our distance from the Sun.) And as for astrological birth control, and garlic juice as a cure for cancer...! An inspiring book - but take it with a grain of salt."
3,re:whatever,"It's naive, not nieve, which is Spanish for snow. If you're going to criticize those of us that do believe that the goddess is in each of us, at least do it in a gramatically correct fashion."
4,Thrills and suspense,I enjoyed this show very much and it leaves the imagination to the actors to express and give. It never lets you sit around and a must for all movie goers to watch. i enjoyed the dvd.
5,SCARY AND INTERESTING,"I THOUGHT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT AND VERY SCARY. IT WAS SLOW, YES. BUT THIS MOVIE HAD A MESSAGE. HEY! DON'T WORK SO MUCH BECAUSE THE DEVIL MAY TAKE YOUR FAMILY AWAY FROM YOU! RELAX! ENJOY!"
2,A special combination of satanism and retardation,"This movie sucked so bad that my hair hurts. The little girl who is going to be married to satan is so ugly. I hope that she isn't expecting to marry anyone better than satan due to her ugliness. The mother is completly insane, like Olivia D'abo would want to have sex with her pock faced monster husband. All the mother does is have paranoid flashes from the movie, but the gay thing is that the flashes are from parts of the movie that haven't happened yet and aren't relevent to anything. This movie is just trying to tell women, ""Hey don't go out and get a job because when you're gone, your beautiful nanny will boff your husband and marry off your daughter to satan."" but then again we can't turn on the nightly news anymore without hearing about somekind of scenario like this one."
1,Pretty lame,"Who were the actors in this? I'd never heard of any of them, and they were pretty bad anyways. I didn't get anything out of this movie at all. I tried to find some sort of story or message but there's just nothing to be found. It seems to be about some everyday mother who gets some European girl to come over and look after her daughter, but the girl has some kind of relationship with the devil or something crazy like that. I feel asleep about 30 minutes from the end, so I didnt see it all but from what I saw, the girl didn't really do anything wrong. Just because the girl took her daughter to some carnival, the mother goes crazy and gets all upset and I just didn't much of a point after that or even before that. It seems the mother believes she owns her daughter like a slave or something. This is nothing but a jealous mother. Just no point in it, no reason to watch."
4,Quick & to-the-point winning techniques for casino gambling.,"The section on craps was an interesting read...and got moreinteresting...I just got back from Vegas after using Jerry Patterson's""rhythm roll."" While I bought the book for the crapssection, I read the entire book on the plane. Every section of thebook is a quick read, with to-the-point analyis, step-by-steptechniques and fun ""in-the-casino"" stories to illustrate thepoints."
4,Average book,This is a great just basic book I wouldnt say it goes into any great detail just give you the basic understanding of the games and where your odds a probably better at making money. But in reality the house always has the advantage your almost better off going the first minute you get to vegas take all your money right to the roulette table and go black or red if you win take the cash and enjoy the rest of your trip not gambling!
5,IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE A WINNER,"At last a book that, does not give you the same old information that you have read in every other book time and time again. It not only gives you a new slant on how to beat the casinos. It backs up each and every method with hard facts. These writers actually show you for the first time that I have ever seen.How to prove at home,that what they are writing really works. When will Mr. Patterson's former critics wake up and smell the coffee? They also could learn a great deal. "" A MUST HAVE FOR THE NOVICE TO THE PROFFESIONAL"""
4,product ok -merchant poor communication,"The product I received was what was shown. However this was not the exact product I needed or could use at all. I wrote to the merchant two times with no reply. As for the product, it was what was shown. As for the merchant. STAY AWAY. If you have a problem or what to discuss the refund policy, they do not reply. It is what it is."
4,A great story,"I just loved this book! I have been a fan of Caroline B. Cooney's for years ever since I read Face on the Milk Carton and this is just another great story. I can see how her version of events may not follow with other peoples but who cares! That is why it's called fiction after all. The heroine is a wonderful person, I really cared about her. I loved the world Cooney put me in when reading this book and would recomend it to anyone who likes Cooney's work."
1,Boooooring!,This was the most boring book I have ever read in my life! The one thing I did like about this book is that it made me fall asleep!
4,Good book for pilgrims,"I recently toured the Holy Land and wanted my visit to be a pilgrimage, not just a tour. This book helped me to achieve that experience. It's well written, very well organized, and focuses on the spiritual experience. It does contain enough travel tips and historical information to make it interesting, but I particularly enjoyed the biblical references and prayers.My only negative comment is that the biblical passages are the author's own translation. While he may have captured the meaning of the passage, the language is too casual. I would have preferred one of the standard translations.But overall, this is an excellent companion book for any pilgrim to the Holy Land."
2,Meh,"The ""accent"" used in the text of this book is ridiculous and distracting. It feels like watching a parody of British people on MAD TV. I don't understand what the point was of writing as a low-class brit stereotype. Many of the actual monsters are a little ridiculous as well."
1,Disappointing,"This mouse pad looks pretty, but it is paper thin (feels very cheap) and contrary to the description, the backing is not very effective at keeping the mouse pad in place. The company should have invested a little more in at least applying a thin pad/backing."
2,Pretty but annoying.,The pad is pretty but will not stay still on the desk. It claims to a no-skid coating on the back but it is ineffective.
3,No Pad,"If you are expecting any pad to the mouse pad, forget it, just a thin layer of plastic with a little semi-sticky surface on the reverse here. Laser mouse tracks fine however, better than on a wood surface. Bullfight seems very phallic, not what I was expecting, but that's Picasso I guess."
5,My most-loved Edward Abbey Book,"I am writing this on March 14th, 1998 - the ninth anniversary of the passing of Cactus Ed. This novel is the most satisfying of Ed,s books. It fills in so much about his life that his non-fiction essays only hinted at. Plus, it's a damn good story. I have all of Ed,s books, all first-editions and most autographed by Ed. I cherish my autographed first edition copy of Fools Progress more than any of my many books. Ah me, today I am sad thinking about Ed. I want to thank him again for all his writings, but especially for his "" Fat Masterpiece"", The Fools Progress. I would love to read the unedited manuscript for this book; the final product is only half as long as the entire story he wanted to tell."
5,Bottom of the bottle eloquence,"The story of a man looking back at his life. He's cynical, cantkerous and gaudy but only because he's afraid to admit that life didn't turn out the way he wanted. But then again, nobody's life turns out the way they fantasize and he finds light in his experiences that were every bit worth the pain. A great insight to the man, Ed Abbey, because the author and main character have so much in common."
4,i really liked it,My boyfriend introduced me to Edward Abbey. He likes to live vicariously through him and wanted me to read him so I could see what a womanizer and a hard living guy really is like!!!!!!!. Ha! He was right. It is heartbreaking and funny. I could not put it down. I am look9ing forward to reading many more.
1,Against the flow...,"I'm sorry but I have to disagree with the majority of the reviews here. I disliked this novel so much I couldn't even finish it...and that's a rare thing for me. I suppose if I wanted to give someone an education on sex from a man's point of view it'd be a great book to recommend. Otherwise I would tell people to skip it. I didn't find Henry's ideas enlightening, and I failed to see how the journey he took was progressive. Maybe I missed the point entirely, but I just wasn't able to appreciate good ol' Henry Lightcap."
3,The story of a hillbilly philospher.,"This book is about the journey and adventure of an Appalachian man's life. He goes through many woeful experiences with love, employment, and other failures in life. But this free spirited Hillbilly from the mountains of West Virginia manages to find strength in his Appalachian family, tradition, and habits to over come the physical and emotional ills that plague his lonely life.""The Fool's Progress"" provides detailed depictions of different environments and personalities with a crude comical twist. It is entertaining to read at times and boring at others. Overall, the book is a heart warming novel that does not really stick with the traditional story telling of having a plot, climax, antagonist, protagonist, and etc. The book also tended to stretch a bit (over 500 pages with no real plot or story line to follow). Rating: 6.5/10"
4,Henry Lightcap (weird yet witty),"Fool's progress by Edward Abbey is about a man by the name of Henry Lightcap and his journey through life. It starts off with a dispute with his wife which eventually leads to a divorce or, does it? Throughout this book we venture through Henry's love life and his career life. It seems as though Henry is portrayed as a cold-hearted lazy man, but in all actuality he is very sweet and he was just searching for the right job that he could be content with. I'm not sure exactly how Edward Abbey wanted Henry to be look at, but to me he ended up being such a nice and caring person no different than anyone else. I would definetely recommend this book to others. It's certainly a non-stop adventure throughout the entire novel."
4,Fool's Progress Home,"Henry Lightcap is a man who is not committed and a lazy man. He cannot hold a job or a wife. An uncontrollable alcoholic who would rather break something than fix it. He is also one of the smartest characters you could meet.In the book Fool's Progress Henry starts the long Journey home to West Virginia from Arizona after his third wife leaves him. On his way back in his old, beat-up truck next to his faithful dog he remembers his whole life. It starts when he's a young kid and works all the way up until hes back home.The Fool's Progress is a great read. It is filled with many unusual facts that just blow my mind about Henry Lightcap. He gets all the way to his Masters jury and decides to give up the idea of being a college professor and live an easy life. Most Americans of today would have taken the degree. I highly recommend Edward Abbey's book."
5,Excellent Book to Read Outside,"I read most of book a few years ago while backpacking in Hetch Hetchy; I could not suggest a better way to read this book. Take it with you on your next outdoor adventure, sit down on a rock somewhere and enjoy it. I had to remind myself on several occassions that it was a work of fiction, although I could picture Ed Abbey in many of the situations."
5,A true classic about the search for un-cluttered happiness,"The writing style of Abbey immediately draws the reader into the novel. Abbey's language and attention to charcter detail makes you feel as though you are reading a personal journel, rather than a novel. One can sense the desperation of the main character and his desire for true happiness. After finishing this book the for the first time, it jumped into my top 5 list of all time..."
4,Sturdy Strap,Also a nice strap in the 8 foot version. My only concern is the weight of the D-ring. I need to be careful that I don't wack myself with it. I am keeping it and will use it along with a 6 foot one I purchased.
4,great for yoga beginners,The belt works great for those who are not very flexible to attain the postures and getting the effect of the energy flow!
5,A quality yoga strap,"This yoga strap is made well, is long enough for someone who is tall, and is worth the purchase price."
3,"Great quality, strap is just too long","Love this strap, great quality just as expected. However, I am 5'5"" and this 8' strap is too long. Would be good for bound angle, but for leg stretches it's too long."
4,The Friendship by Mildred Taylor,"This book by Mildred Taylor was very good.I liked it a whole bunch.It was about 4 kids and Mr.Tom Bee.He was in The Well also.In this book he calls Mr.jJohn Wallace by his first name and isn't allowed to.Mr.Tom saved him when they were little kids and John promised that he could always call him by his first name.That promise doesn't last for long though.When Tom went to John's store he called him by his first name and got mad ,so when Mr.Tom was leaving he was shot by someone but who?"
2,the friendship,I did not realy like this book. It was an example of how whites treated blacks. It was kind of short and did not realy go into details to let you know the story. It just gave you enough to know what they were talking about. It would be best for ages about 8. It does not have bad language but it is not good for younger kids.
2,The Friendship,"I guess it was a pretty good book, but other kids will have to read it themselves. this book was about 3 boys and 1 girl, they have this friendship but at the end of the book this guy named john shot Mr. Tom Bee, and that's how I rate this book, a 2."
2,The book I didn't care for.,The critique is the main thing of the story. I rate the story on a scale from one through ten it would be a six. I really did not like the story at all. I thought it was boring. It was too old for me. I would compare this to Harry Potter. I hate Harry Potter and this one. It is not fun or cool at all. It is flat out not good enough! I'll tell you that all the good parts are in the beginning and the end. I think that you might like this book better me. It was pretty easy to read. The kids are out of school for spring break. Then they go fishing at the lake near Mississippi. It was kind of hard to understand. The reason the why I rate it a six is because it was not well put together.
