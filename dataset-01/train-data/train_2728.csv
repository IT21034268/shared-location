1,Ummmmmmm,"Well, what to say. what to say. I haven't read this book and actually I'm really not planning on it. How can a book such as this help you or in any way make your life any better or clearer. Make your own decisions. Read uplifting books that can teach you things of value. If you want to find out what is true don't take someone else'e opinion for it. Pray, with faith in what you truly feel within your heart. Remember you are a son or daoughter of God and He loves you very much. I know this because I have felt this in my life."
2,"interesting, but hardly based on ""truths""","The author makes an interesting story, even a page turner, but her autobiographical account can hardly be taken as truths of the Mormon church. As unfortunate as her story is, it is not a ""peek"" into the Mormon church or even a typical mormon family. Having lived around Mormons most of my life, I can say this is a gross exageration of a unique circumstance and based on hearsays and past clouded recollections of a religion she no longer (at the time of writing) adhered to or even believed in. I, too, could write a jaded and hateful view of a past religion in my life, full of every negative person and account blown into almost false proportions. but, that is never an uplifting nor ""Christlike"" way to focus time or energy. As with any religion, don't listen (or read) the hateful comments of ""ex-members"". Find out truths for yourself through proper channels and only then can one make an enlightened decisions concerning religion. This is not one!!"
4,Excellent Insight Into Mormon Women & Their Role,"Ms. Laake's book provided some excellent personal information about women's role in the Mormon church. The secrecy, the required submission of women, men who ""lord"" over their families, the lack of individual freedom and expression...some very startling, eye opening revelations. I have a Mormon friend and have noticed several of these aspects but couldn't completely relate. This book helped me understand the doctrines and attitudes. Ms. Laake deserves kudos for sharing her very personal story with the world. It is very hard to realize that even in this day and age, there are still people who delegate women to second class citizenship and think God exists in secret handshakes and names. If you must hide it from the world then it has nothing to do with God. A very good read. Kept my attention throughout."
3,Another SLC reader,"While not the most well written book I have ever read I do believe the contents to be accurate. I know many members of the LDS church, both practicing and non, who have told the same stories. Not to the same degree but the temple ceremonies, garments, secret names and handshakes are all true and makes this less of a religion and more of fraternity/cult.For me the bottom line is that the picture portrayed of a woman's place in the Mormon Church is right on. Your foremost function on earth is as a breeder. You exist only to bring the souls out of heaven and onto earth. Your only way into heaven is if your husband pulls you through the veil. Women have NO divinity in this church which makes it the most misogynistic I have ever come across. I do not need to read the Book of Mormon to know that this is the REAL truth they practice."
5,Fascinating...true courage!,"Next time a person from the Morman church knocks on your door, you may want to think twice! This is a fascinating story of woman brought up as a ""true believer."" It details how the Morman religion impacted her life in some incredible and bizarre ways. It took Ms. Laake tremendous courage to tell her story. When I tried to discuss this book with missionaries, they refused! Praise for Ms. Laake for breaking the silence and telling it like it is! If you read this book and enjoy it as much as I did, try reading The Mormon Murders by Steven Naifeh and Gregory Smith. Wait til you read about Mark Hofmann and how he sold the Mormon church fake documents that they kept hidden away. A compelling true story of greed, forgery, deceit, and death."
4,"Religously accurate, a little too self aware.","Having lived in Northern Utah for many years, and having numerous mormon friends,(practicing and non-practicing), I found most of her religious facts to be accurate. At times she dwelled on the the church's views of sex a little too often, it non-the-less held my attention to the end. A good read for those who are curious about the Mormon religion"
1,I think this book is bigotted trash.,First I am not a Saint. There are some truths that are uplifting and other truths that have no usefulness in this life. This book is filled with the latter kind of truths. It's obvious the author had quite an ax to grind against the Latter Day Saints. I am not a bigot. I have many friends who are Mormon. No matter what anybody says they never baptized my dog or cat.
1,A Disappointment,"This book will disappoint those expecting information on the bizarre world of Mormon practice and belief. It reveals few ""secrets"" except to describe the Temple initiation ceremony in superficial detail. It is primarily about the author's love life. Those drawn to Harlequin romance may choose to consider her the tragic victim of a repressive cult; others may consider that even a repressive cult is not an entirely satisfactory explanation for being shallow, vain, and not terribly bright."
4,"No title, just my opinion","I just received this book last night and already by this morning I was finished. It's that good! A very good depiction of her strict upbringing and struggle to find her voice after so many years of being slient (both by the church and her husbands). The down side of the book were the numerous run-on sentences, which by the time I'd finished them, I couldn't really remember what she was talking about. And, there's some mormon jargon that I didn't get even after she tried to explain it. But, I still finished the last page wanting more. I empathized with her immediately. I think this is a book all young women should read, mormon or not. There is very much a bit of all of us in there! What an eye-opener!"
2,Disappointing,"This book fails to deliver on its promise of revealing shocking truths about the Church of Latter Day Saints. While I did learn a few things, there was only one tidbit of information I was surprised by. Women, after married, must wear special garments against their skin. It does make me pay more attention to the women in the Church's commercials.The author may have found writing the book to be a cathartic experience but I found it tedious."
2,Secret ceremonies or boring redundant whining?,"I was very disappointed in this book. Not being a Mormon, I was expecting to be enlightened to the secret ceremonies of the Mormon wife, instead I was led through a very boring journey of the author's disatisfied sex life and how she dealt with her personal problem. The book has very little to do with what the title suggests. It's simply the author's very self-indulgent vehicle to spill her own indiscrete secrets without giving much thought to what the reader picked up the book for in the first place.If you're interested in reading about the Mormon lifestyle, this book is definitely a let down."
1,"""Hollow moan of dogma"" comes from author, not religion","Although not a Mormon, I am nevertheless quite educated as to their beliefs and practices, having been born and raised in Utah. This book is the most pitiful and vain attempt at sensationalism I've ever encountered. In her vengeful and venemous attacks on the church, the author exposes her blatantly prejudiced and intolerant personality. The LDS church does not condone abuse or some of the other things the author went through. Unfortunately, at times an individual may make a mistake and it will taint the organization as a whole. This does not mean the organization is at fault. Besides objectivity being nonexistant and facts at times miconstrued, the author's attempt to take out her lack of being breastfed as a baby (or whatever her problem is) taints her own self more than the church she wishes to injure. If you are looking for factual information about the Mormon church, do not read this crap"
4,you either like it or you don't,"My Roman Catholic hands bought the hardbound way back in '94 while in college. Deborah's struggle within her home and community caught my interest more than the Church authority misleading its followers to covet. (Nothing new in that dept!) The terrible absurdity going on in a household is much easier to relate, envision, and discuss productively. Her struggle and confusion looks like a very real feminine awakening and spiritual transformation her friends, family, and church could not fathom. I'm sure the community meant well in helping her, but the well-known LDS support system missed her issues by a long shot...probably the only time I laughed while reading this. Good book in my opinion; candid and easy to read. It's the kind of book that disappears after passing it on to friends, thus forcing you to buy another one. Check it out from the library before going out and buying. Readers who take sacred text at face value will probably hate this book."
5,The truth shall set you free,I will expect every devout Mormon to make very mean attacks on both Ms. Laake (RIP) and her book. Being in the center of all the brainwashing elements of the churches dogma and hocus pocus they know no better.I was a convert who had been in the real world and coming into the church began to seriously doubt its validity. Laake's understanding of the true nature of the church and it's founder are exactly what I felt. It spoke to me so that I read it very quickly wanting to read it again. I was finally comforted by the thought that I was not just being difficult.It easy to blame everything on the devil. But it is even harder to prove a religion so the church protects its image in a scary behaviour which she more than well describes.I loved this book and this author for being brave enough to come forward and tell her very real story of depression and a mad up religion that caters to men in scary ways.
2,Not very enlightening,"This was okay, but not great. From the title I did expect something more concrete than a few oblique and anecdotal references to the ""Secret Ceremonies"" in the title...I am thinking the publishers replaced the original title with this one to make it seem more Tell ALL ish....The subtitle is much truer to the story line.In the end it was a good read, and worth my time and all...The story of a woman who started her life as a fairly mindless sheep among the flock, and eventually came to consciousness through the emptiness that life as a sheep offers...Any Mormon or otherwise religiously raised woman, who is in an unfulfilling marriage needs to put this on their list.That is why, as a never married bachelor, I only gave it 2 stars..."
2,A self-serving account by a lunatic and suicide,"This book was written by a mixed-up woman who had nothing less than four failed relationships with men and blamed her church for the failures. She spent time in a lunatic asylum where she danced with a woman who imaginged herself to be a horse. She was for a long time a darling of the liberal, anti-Mormon set, but eventually killed herself. The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on."
1,Get a life! Move on!,The fact that this book is out of print and people are still previewing reviews means that either Ms. Laake has no life or her relatives and friends have no life (or someone has a pitiful agenda).Farewell to a terribly written book....
1,Can I rate this zero stars? No. So one star it is.,"June 8 2011 Arrived within 48hrs of ordering. Shower bag was easily assembled, immediately washed, rinsed, and filled to 3/5ths capacity and then laid flat (on a towel on my lawn) in full sun for 3 hours as directed. After 3 hrs I felt the bag and it was very warm to touch. Great, right? WRONG!!! I tried to lift the solar shower so that I could use it but the handle ripped straight across at the seam below the handle. I was excited about this purchase, I even took pictures as it was unpacked so that I could post an accurate and detailed review. If the return goes smoothly I will edit my review and maybe add another star."
1,Poorly Made,"As the kids would say - ""it's a fail"". The first time I filled it (to rinse as recommended) the heat welded seam between the handle and bladder tore. The bladder didn't leak (yet) but I can't hang it either. Don't waste your money or time on this piece of shower."
3,Heated but broke,"This heated the water just fine but somehow the handle broke. I didn't even hang it up, just poured the hot water into a bucket to use with my camp shower pump. When I was putting it away, I noticed the handle broke, I guess just by carrying it the short distance from the picnic table to the tent shower. So it heats the water but if you're using it to hang up I wouldn't think it would last too long."
5,great seller,The Cd is almost new and plays beautifully. It is one of my favorites and someone ruined it now I have it back thanks
5,Plush Otter is delightful,My daughter bought this stuffed otter for her boyfriend. They exchange stuffed animals and this one is so delightful! It was shipped in a very timely manner and we all were very pleased with the quality of the toy.
2,Very disapointing,"Dream signals in full circles is a great album, but this is terrible! it ruins one good song after another. Well, it gets two stars though, there are two-three pretty good songs on the album... but I prefer the original."
4,Better than Sewing for Dummies!,"Being a beginner, many sewing books (I have about 8 reference books!) are too advanced and ambitious for me and take for granted that everyone knows all the sewing terms. This book is such a no brainer that I am thinking of getting the rest of the series."
4,A treasure for anyone interested in commercial aviation!,Lots of high-quality pictures printed on glossy paper. Facts and explanations.
3,"Lots of airplanes, skimpy on details","If you want to know the base model of an airplane you see at some airport, this book will do an excellent job. However, if you would like to know details in depth, keep searching. There is minimal data to distinguish the various models of the airplane, take-off weights, seating configurations, or many interesting details.A minor quibble: I'd like to see the drawings to scale, perhaps at the back of the book."
5,this book really makes you think!,"I really love this book because even though it's quite short it teaches a lesson about not turning on people before you have more information. it's very well written, and quite cardesque, if you know what i mean."
3,Pretty good for a children's book,"I do not know what compels best-selling genre authors to write picture books for children, but many of them have done it, including James Herriot, Dean Koontz, Jeffrey Archer, and even Gabriel Marcia Marquez. As far as kids' books go, this one is pretty good. The story is simple, but the illustrations are unique, with every picture combining elements of medieval fantasies (castles, knights, dragons, abbots) and contemporary life (computers, scanners, office meetings). It is also interesting when the text says one thing, such as ""Queen Heather mounted her steed"", and the picture shows something different, like the Queen speeding off in a sports car. The subject matter is a bit mature; the pictures (more than the prose) imply acts of suicide and adultery. However, everything works out happily ever after in the end."
1,"Cool illustrations, creepy message","I was disturbed by this story. As far as I could tell, the message was: ""Even if your husband ignores you and doesn't listen to your child when she says there's a problem, you should stay with him. Because when he's done with the really important stuff, like his job, he'll eventually come back to you. Oh, and kids who dress goth are unloving. They just need to discover the pretty pretty princess inside.""I did, however, love the illustrations. They're full of clever visual jokes merging modern and medieval images, like a guy being punished in the stocks...which is attached to a meter."
1,A Question,"I do not understand this - ie - is the cover included in the price or is the price for frame and mattress alone. I need to know before I order....thank you......Paula SchlgelmilchProduct DescriptionProduct Description Futon is great for sleepovers. Full-size futon sleeper has a steel tri-fold frame thatfts 54""W x 30""D x 28""H with black powdercoat finish and opens to a 75""W x 54""L sleeper. Assembly is required. The firm mattress has a foam core covered in black cotton duck. Cover is cotton denim with striped accent pillows. Frame is imported. Mattress and cover made in USA.pFrame and Mattress also sold separately. (553544EL)"
2,Confused,"Is the slipcover included? If not, what type of slipcover should be bought for it. Also, how will it be shipped? For example, does it come as two boxes and assembly is required or does it come as is shown in the picture? I would like to know this information because if it would be perfect for my room."
1,This Book Is Horrid,"This book is more a directory of brothels, dance clubs with ""happy ending"" options, and how to get a prostitute into a room than it is about meeting and getting women.It's really not that good at all."
5,great quality,awesome quality. sturdy and waterproof. had strong gold plated connections with a waterproof housing. i replaced my whimpy 10 awg alternator charging lead with a 80 amp fusible link with this fuse holder and 0 awg wire.
5,Oh my...!,"That is what you will say everytime you hear this song. It will make want to dance everytime you hear it. All the singing and sharp drops and pickups make it very enjoyable to dance alone or with a big group of friends. Even now I still say ""Oh my..."" whenever I hear it on the radio or on my CD payer. =)"
5,It Feels So Good [CD-SINGLE],Definitely a grooving quintissential new millenium song with an 80's pop touch. Everytime you hear it you will just feel energized and want to dance. Moving and fun.
4,"fast shipping, nd solved my gas burning issue","Received, and installed today. Comes with decent instructions and a torx bit, but the torx bit that comes with it is 3 times too big so couldn't use it any way"
1,Caveat emptor: Bad copies going around,"I want to hear this because the NY Times critic in his book gave it his top recommendation for the Ravel piano concertos. Really? There is a fantastic recording of the Ravel by Michelangeli on EMI. He is fantastic; EMI is as dry and brittle souding as ever. (Sigh).Unfortunately, I've received two copies that both show ""Apex Ravel, Piano Concertos Debussy Fantaisie for Piano and Orchestra"" but the music is really Mozart's Requiem. So, sellers, do yourselves a favor and listen for piano music. If it is, well it might be. If there is not - it's one for the garbage can. Buyers beware. When you get your disk listen to it right away."
2,Only okay,Was fairly disappointed in this product's performance. Have to place it Just Right and soil needs to be Just So - otherwise wind up yanking away at branches of weed and not the weed itself.
5,Fulfills its role perfectly.,"I've had one of these for about ten years now, and it still works perfectly. It's the ideal choice for those ""pop-up"" broad-leaf weeds that appear in the middle of everyone's lawns. It pulls that sucker out, root and all, without leaving any sign that they've been there. In this kind of situation, chemicals would kill the surrounding grass."
2,Hound Dog Dandelion Puller,"The design concept is good but this tool needs some reconfiguration before it's truly effective.1. The pulling tines should be a bit longer. (They aren't long enough to grab on and pull up the whole dandelion root, even in wet soil.)2. The diameter of the base of the tines (where they are mounted) needs to be about 1/4 inch more. (Would give a better chance of grabbing onto the root as the exact center of a dandelion is sometimes hard to eyeball.)3. Shaft of tool needs to be about 3 inches longer. (So the tool-user doesn't have to bend over so much to use this thing.)"
4,Works Very Well,I bought this for my wife who hates dandelions. It works 90% of the time at removing the entire tap root - some are just too big or too deep. The tool can get stuck if you aren't forceful with it - be prepared to use your fist/palm to eject the offending dandelion - only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 stars.
4,The weed hound is no dog!,"I can't beleive the weedhound works so well, its well worth the money. It worked so well for me that I bought one for my father's birthday!"
4,Good Dog,Much easier and faster than pulling weeds by hand. Works very well on dandelions and other leafy weeds. Works okay on other weed types. My soil is a rocky clay mixture so it often times doesn't get the whole root.
1,Did not pull entire tap root,"The Hound Dog would get the leaves and, if you aimed well, the top 1/2"" of the tap root (Dandelion, russian thistle, burdock, etc). But it did not get the entire root, so the darn weed just keeps coming back.I am still looking for a better weed puller, for now I'll contine to crawl around with my hand tools."
1,Does Not Get Root!,I have used this on dandelions and it does pull off the top of the weed that is above ground but it does not remove the root! Looks like I am back to old fashioned hand tool to remove root.The product has nails at the end that close together in the ground. They should have spent 0.30 more on product and used longer nails.Too bad design of the product doesnt allow me to substitute nails that actually might work removing the root.Oh well. Return of product to store coming.
1,Disappointing,"It takes too much work for the few weeds that really do get removed by the root. If the ground is too hard or too soft, you won't pluck anything out. And if you have a real problem with weeds, this gadget won't pluck more than the money in your wallet."
2,Amazon Jacked the price,"I put this in my cart, waited a day to think it over and it went from $14.95 to $23.21.Increase of over 60%.Amazon sure knows how to screw a person over."
2,"Look for something better, this does not work","I bought this device at Home Depot and have used it for over a year.I works okay in dry conditions on small dandalions but that is about it.If the soil is moist or the dandalions are mid to large in size, you are wasting your timeWith moist soil, you just end up pushing the plant deeper no matter the size of the plantWith larger plants, it does not get the root.I going to have to get something better as my yard is full of dandalions and this was useless"
3,small weeds,"This thing works on small weeds, but the tines are too small for the big ones.You have to have good boots on when using this."
5,"Well-made, easy to use","The Weed Hound is all steel and is very well-made. The (few) moving parts are heavy-duty and two seasons of use have failed to damage it, beyond wearing the paint off the parts that actually penetrate the ground. It has the added advantage of leaving a tidy little aeration hole in the soil every time you pop out a weed. Just place, step, twist/pull and the weed is extracted, with all or most of the root. It generally works better on broadleaf weeds than on stuff like crabgrass that have spreading root systems but you can't beat it for dandelions.And it's made in the USA."
4,goodbye weeds,"quality construction and easy to use. Gets weeds out with the root. Leaves a little bigger hole than I expected, but they fill in fast and this is not a problem. I can get rid of my dandilions without having all those ugly brown patches in my lawn."
5,Great for dandelions!,"The weed hound works great! I purchased a home not too long ago, and with it came a yard full of weeds. I don't think I'll ever catch up with the dandelions, but there's something mighty satisfying about plucking them roots and all from the earth with this tool. It doesn't require much effort to insert it into the ground and yank out a giant weed along with its roots. I'd recommend it to anyone who has dandelions and a bit of patience."
5,Hound Dog weeder,Great for pulling weeds. You have to find the center of the weed however in order to pull it out properly. Good for the price.
4,Worth The Time,I lead a womens ministry group and was looking for a book we could use to study the fruit of the spirit. It turns out my selection was a good one. This is an easy to read easy to understand book that breaks down the fruit of the spirit and how it relates to our daily living in a way the group appreciates.
1,Dangerous,"I am currently in a group and we are using this book for our study. The subject was very interesting to all of us and I looked forward to the study. The other reviews for the book are fantastic, but I would ask readers to beware. After reading the first half of the book I am very disturbed. The book speaks to a woman needing to go to God in prayer if she is being ridiculed or if pain is inflicted upon her (p.98). This is a dangerous message to send to a woman who may not be in a respectful relationship and could encourage emotional and physical abuse. I wish Ms. George would address that there are situations in which prayer is not enough and the person involved needs to remove them self from the situation. So far I have not read anything to support this position and I doubt I will finish the book. I think Christian women need to be careful of this book and its message."
1,"All History, No Soccer","6 Needless DVD's (all information could probably be combined onto 2 DVD's). More footage of scenery than anything else (mountains, rivers, oceans). Very little goal or highlight footage. More political than soccer-related. More interviews than anything else. This is a low budget film wrapped in expensive, attractive packaging. They milk scenery footage and interviews (i.e. filler) for all they're worth because they obviously don't want to spend money on goal and soccer highlights. Also, this movie only covers through 1998 so it's already outdated. You'd get much more entertainment from ""All the goals of World Cup 1998"" or something like that."
2,"If you don't like Ken Burns and bad audio, then you won't like this","First of all, the production standards are terrible on this. Very nice, a bit staid, cinematography, but the sound mix is atrocious. The music booms, along with the narration, but interviews are recorded on sub-par, breathy microphones and are mixed very low in comparison to everything else. Even with the volume set too high for comfort in respect to the music and Stamp narration, you strain to hear the interviews.And the presentation is very formulaic and drowsy. None of the energy of the game is captured. Instead you find the Ken Burns-ian approach of reducing any story, no matter its particular dynamics, to a deadly pace of voiceover over obvious imagery - cut to interview - cut to historical shot. I've only made it through Disc 1, and find it difficult to believe I'd make it through seven. But if I'm proven wrong, I will append this review."
4,Very pretty,"My daughter loves the pictures. The story itself was a little over here head , but she did love that it was a bout a mother and her son."
5,Another Wonderful Book by Larry Martin,"This sequel to the first ""True Believers"" is also a collection of first hand testimonials from people who received the Pentecostal experience at Azusa. It is very moving to read in their own words how these men and women received their supernatural touch from God and went all over the world carrying the message of the Gospel and the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Simply put, this is an awesome book!"
2,MAdness is better but the college gmes arent that good,This game isnt that great the graphics r bad the gameplay is slow and overall its a bad game. the simulation is ok but sum players r underated. Although its cheaper prices r comming down for EA but this game is so low cuz the graphics r unbelivably bad and non realistic. Also shooting free throws in this game is much harder then EA. My advice dont get this game ur better off gettin March Madness even if the price is a lil higher
2,Why change a good thing?,"Last year's instalment of this game was great, I don't understand why they changed it. First off, I think the gameplay is horrible. On defense, the player strafes unless you use speed burst. On offense, if you barely tap the arrows while you don't have the ball, the player does some jerky motion and moves way too far. Free throws are just plain retarded. And I really love the explanation they give in the book. Also, the legacy mode is way too involved. I'm in college, so I don't have time to try and recruit and do practice and all that stuff, sometimes I just want to play a game. I gave the game 2 stars because of the create-a-player feature and the fact that you can customize conferences before starting a dynasty. Other than that, this game was a HUGE dissapointment from last year's game."
4,Good Game,"I can't give this game a 5 because every time you get a ball blocked they say it's out on you, they have the names all wrong so just use numbers, the announcers are so annoying and always say the same things, and you get called for reaching in way to many times. The goods things are they got the right places in the NCAA Tourny, you got the campus store where yoou can buy jerseys and arenas, and it's like you are actually watching the game on ESPN. So overall a good game."
2,March Madness is better,"how can u compare this game to march madness. the gamplay isnt nearly as good as march madness and the season mode isnt nearly as fun. The only good thing is u can be the Universtiy of Vermont, the graphics r pretty good and it was 15$PEACE UVM RULES"
5,Great record in excellent shape.,Thanks you for having this record & more importantly taking care of it so it can be used professionally. Thank you so much.Alex James
3,It's analog alright..,"Ordered two of these at separate times. The first I tried to calibrate using the wet cloth then salt test and it was about 5% of. Reading online articles about how to adjust by using a tiny screwdriver, I tried it and low and behold mine was not adjustable. So after extremely messing that one up, I ordered a second one. It arrived along with a few other things I ordered and it was shattered during shipping. Contacted the seller and they were fantastic about getting me a free replacement. After calibrating that one, its approx. 22% off. Since then I have learned my lesson about analog hygrometers, don't buy them unless you know it is a reputable brand. I found that Xikar's digital hygrometer is by far the best. Yes you pay quite a bit for one, but it pays for itself when you are trying to keep you cigar stash in excellent condition. I am currently using it in my humidor of 50 and its working fabulous."
2,Hygrometer review,"When you look at the photo of the hygrometer on the website, it is very appealing, but the picture is deceiving. This hygrometer had no dimensions on which to base it's size. It is only 1"" in diameter, which is very small. I had hoped it to be at least 6"" so it was very upsetting when I got it. It was a gift for someone and I was quite embarrassed to give it to the person."
1,Broken !!!!,Ordered and was very excited to calibrate and place in my humidor when to find that glass was broken!! I called cheap humidors were kind enough to send another one at no charge. Recieved today and to find that this one to the glass was also broken! It looks like it was broken before they even shipped it because the box looks like it has had others on top on it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I'll be sure to call AGAIN Monday morning and ask for my money back.
3,Brass Analog Hygrometer,It works and meets my needs as far as I am able to determine. The product is satisfactory based on the price and description. It was delivered on time.
1,Cheap hygrometer,"My sample of this thing did not work. After sitting overnight in my unhumidified house, it read 60%. I followed directions for calibrating with salt in a bag after which it should read 75%, but this one read over 100%. It isn't adjustable, so I returned it to the seller."
2,Broke after 3 months,"This worked fine for 3 months, and then got stuck at 51%. The meter no longer moves no matter what the humidity is.One other gripe - if you decide to glue the magnet that comes with it to the back, you can no longer access the calibration screw."
3,Calibration,"There were no instructions with this. I wrote to the seller who was no help. Turns out there is a magnetic back, behind which is the calibration screw which I found by accident."
3,"So far, so good","It works, I did the salt paste calibration and adjusted it. It looks good, but beware it comes with no documentation whatsoever. It also had a soft plastic ring around it, and I wasn't sure whether or not to leave it on. Seems to read fairly accurately. Tested it outside using current reported humidity after calibration and it was pretty close."
2,No more,"I have no faith in these anymore. Some have calibration screws, some don't. Some have the same results with the digital hygrometers that have been humidity tested but just as many have varying differences. Even the one's that do have the cal. screws don't seem to keep consistent with humidity changes. It would help if the manufacturers either:1. Provided instructions for these things.2. Made a consistently quality-sure product.Mercy!"
4,Smart & well-written,An insightful look at the effects of war on those most powerless to stop it - kids. A good book for teachers. A good way to introduce social awareness into the classroom. Highly recommended!
5,Soap carving,Bought this for my 12 yr old grandson. He had a lot of fun carving the soap. It is easy and very safe way for him to get started learning to carve.
5,soap carving,"Book is very easy to follow. 9yr old son was able to follow book, make tools and carve without any help! nice book and nice projects. This is way messier than I expected. The soap is hard to clean up and cakes on to the table and floor so just a sweep up isn't sufficient. Although I like the idea of the non knife tools I probably would have been happier with wood and a childrens wood carving kit/book."
1,Super shiny,I bought this stuff assuming it was the perfect thing to cleanup my steering wheel. The wheel is leather wrapped and about one year old. This stuff immediately soaked in and has created a completely undesirable shiny terrible look to the wheel. I missed a small spot and the difference between where it was applied and original is drastic. I hope it will eventually wear off. This stuff is way too invasive. I would seriously avoid this product on any semi new leathers.
5,A must have,"A must have for all new parents, has everything that you might need and didnt realize it until the moment hits, this way you're prepared."
4,Must Have!!!,"This kit supplies you with all of the essential tools needed in the early years. The nail clippers are perfect for those little tiny nails. The convenient case keeps everything together and secure inside. Easy to store in a drawer, diaper bag etc."
2,Not so great product.,"I got this set as a gift when I had my son. The medicine dropper is worthless, the medicine just leaks out. The thermometer doesn't beep, the bulb does not work. The bag is great for travel though. I filled it with useful items and it's great. The clippers are great too, and the large end is great because it's harder lose. Bottom line, if you get one as a gift, you can find a way to use some of the items. Just throw away the bulb and the dropper. Don't waste your own money on it though."
3,Good,This is good to have for emergency situations. I tried using the aspirator and it did not work like the one that they gave me in the hospital. The rest is ok.
3,a few good items,"The nail clippers, nose bulb and thermometer are the things I use mostly. The medicine dropper and measuring spoon are not all that helpful because I find them too big to deliver small doses. The syringe provided by the pharmacist for my baby's medicine worked much better."
3,So So,"The case is handy to keep in a diaper bag but the bulb syringe is useless it doesnt do anything, I use the one I got from the hospital instead. The nail clippers and thermometer are nice as well."
3,Might as well buy individual items...,"We bought this kit and found only the thermometer and nail clippers useful. I havent had an opportunity to use the medicine dropper and spoon since most of the medicines come with droppers included and it is best to use those droppers for accurate dosage. It is a disadvantage that the thermometer doesnt beep, so I have to place it in such a way that i can read it. It is best to use the aspirator you get in the hospital. That is much better.."
5,Great for the diaper bag,"I got one of these at my doctors office when I was pregnant for free. I could not believe it!!!I also got 2 at my baby shower. I love them. I keep one in my diaper bag, one at my mother's house and one in my living room. They are nice for emergencies and they are compact. I definitely recomend getting a few of these."
2,Only so-so,"I registered for this without really thinking things through. I have been disappointed with the quality of the items. We had to use the medicine dropper when our son was only 2 weeks old, and it's very difficult to use. If you don't get the medicine dosage right the very first time, it's almost impossible to adjust it. Way too much air gets trapped inside. Additionally, it's hard to clean. As for the bulb syringe- use the one you get from the hospital. It's soooo much better. The themometer is accurate, but it doesn't beep!!! I got very frustrated trying to take my son's temperature under his arm. He was crying, and I had to keep staring at the small digital screen as well as hold him down.The nail clippers are okay. I do like how they have a rather ergonomic handle.Instead of buying a kit, buy what you need separately. You'll pay more, but you'll get a better product."
4,I don't know why other people don't like this kit,"My baby's nose is small so the nasal aspirator fits perfectly into her nose to suction out mucous when she's congested. Okay, I admit when she gets older, I'll have to use a bigger bulb. (I did buy one separately). The digital thermometer works wonderfully and is very easy to use. The nail clippers are great for clipping those tiny nails and you don't have to be afraid of cutting your baby's skin. I haven't used the medicine spoon yet or the dropper, but I think this is a very handy kit to have."
1,Skip This Item,I put this item on my registry thinking it would be great........however the suction bulb cracked after 2 weeks (luckily the hospital gives you one) The thermometer was not accurate (unless my baby really had a tempertature of 78) Any medication you will give you baby has it's own dropper with it!! In fact the only item I use is the nail clippers!!! This is the 4th product from Safety 1st that I no longer use after two months. I am not impressed!!!!!
2,Not really needed.,"This is not a bad product, but it is not very useful. The only thing I have used so far was the thermometer - and it works well. You receive a medicine dropper with any prescription requiring one. The nasal aspirator you receive before leaving the hospital is the best, do not lose this - I have not even used the one in this set. The nail clippers will probably be more useful when my daughter gets older, I tried using them and could not cut the nails short enough so she would not scratch herself. (we use emery boards.) The medicine spoon may come in handy, but she is still too young to use it (3 months)."
2,Not a real life saver,"I got these for my baby shower and thought they would be great. I use the thermometer, but the nose bulb is useless. The only bulb I founfd that works are the hospital issue ones ( guard these with your life!!! ) The nail clippers are not very sharp, so they don't cut, and the medicine dropper you can get for free from most pharmacies. I would say save your money"
1,What a joke!,"This was totally worthless. The thermometer didnt' work. The bulb syringe was too small and the hospital gave us a good one when we brought our baby home. I returne this right away. Invest in a good thermometer. We bought one for $ that can be used under the arm, in the mouth, or in the rectum and is quick and accurate and we needed the peace of mind that it gives us knowing it really works!"
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"MY HUSBAND PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND I THOUGHT I WOULD REALLY LOVE IT, BUT AFTER USING THE THERMOMTER I LEARNED THAT IT DOESN'T BEEP WHEN IT'S DONE TAKING THE TEMPERATURE. I WOULD SHOP AROUND NEXT TIME"
4,Great gift for baby showers,"What would mothers do without this kit?! This is truly practical for all mothers of newborns. It is a life saver. The nail clippers keep baby's nails short so they don't scratch themselves. How many times have we seen a baby with scratches on her/his face? Also includes a spoon for dispensing medicine, an ear cleaner and other important items. Vital for all babies!"
3,"okay, but not great","Came in handy, but I didn't like the thermometer as much as my home one. It took forever. I was also able to fit some of babys medicine in the pouch as well!"
2,Cheaply made and not so good.,"This item was not very good -- every single item was kinda crappily made and useless. I had to buy another thrmoemter, aspirator and nail clipper within a week of my son's birth."
2,just okay...,"This is a nice idea, but the individual components are poor in quality. The nasal aspirator doesn't get enough suction. Of course, I've never found an aspirator at the store that did work as well as the one we got from the hospital. Do yourself a favor and just ask for an extra one before you're discharged from the hospital. Second, the thermometer takes FOREVER to get a reading, and it doesn't beep or anything to let you know it's finished. The clippers are okay, but I've definitely used better ones that were just a buck or two. Never used the medicine dropper because the pharmacy gives you one for free when you get a prescription, and other baby medications (Tylenol, Motrin, PediaCare, etc) come with their own specially calibrated dispensers. The medicine spoon? Give me a break. My daughter balked at that one the one time I did try to use it."
1,Zipper sucks,I received this as a gift and the zipper busted the first time I opened it--after trying to fix it I gave up and threw the case out.
5,All in One,"Wonderful all in one package..Easy to toss right in the diaper bag and take along. All it needs is a brush and you are set. I love the clippers!! They are just the right ""sharpness"" to get the job done & the handle makes it easier to hang onto when the little one gets antsy about having their nails clipped."
1,Delux Nursery Care Kit,The only two items I used in this kit were the nail clippers and the thermometer.The syringe is too short and fat to use in baby's nose. I prefer a syringe instead of a teaspoon or dropper to administer liquid medication.
2,It's ok,I haven't really used it... the sucker is too small... I like the one I got from the hospital better... I don't like the nail clippers they are awkward to use. I keep it in the diaper bag for emergencies only...
3,so-so...,I leave this kit in my diaper bag for when I am away from home. I haven't really had a use for any of these things except for the aspirator. The tip is too big for the nostils of my (newborn) baby. The one that come with the Little Noses saline drops (which you can purchase separately) is so much better (for newborns).Otherwise I love this kit. At least you can clean out the aspirator. I have another kit at home that you cannot clean out. Yuck!!
2,Looks Good but Looks aren't EVERYTHING,"The nasal aspirator has a larger opening and smaller bulb than those you get from the hospital. I found it to be utterly useless, the bulb is hard to compress and it doesn't suck at all. The clippers appear to be easy to handle but I didn't find this to be true. Perhaps it is because I have small hands but I really had a hard time trying to handle and manueuver them. The medicine dropper and spoon will come in handy once the baby is bigger."
2,Deluxe Nursery Care Kit,"I registered for this set, not exactly knowing what I'd need when the baby arrived. It just looked like a practical gift. Now that my baby is older, I realize most of these items are unnecessary. Although the nail clipper works wonderfully (and the items come in a nice zippered pouch), the other items are just not necessities. Medicine droppers are always included with the medicines you purchase. Also, you'll most likely get an aspirator from the hospital. It's a relatively inexpensive item, but I could have just bought a nice nail clipper instead."
3,Great clippers,"I received this as a gift and have only used the nail clippers. I like them because they are not sharp and have a large handle. They are easy to control and I am not afraid of snipping my baby's fingertips. I use them weekly. As for the other items, I fortunately have not had to use them yet since the baby has been quite healthy so far. I suppose my review may change then!"
4,Not crazy about the suction bulb,For the most part this kit contains a lot of essential baby items. It's convenient holding case is also a nice way to keep things neatly stored and is pretty durable. The only thing that I was slightly disappointed about was that the suction bulb just doesn't seem to work nearly as well as the one I received at the hospital. I guess everything can't be perfect though!
4,I've used all the pieces,"And with the exception of the bulb syringe, they all worked well. I already had 2 Safety 1st Thermometers, so I was used to the way they worked. We used the dropper to feed our son expressed milk before he was 2 weeks old. I used it later to put homemade saline drops in his nose. I used the medicine spoon to give him benadryl after tossing that stupid flimsy plastic cup that comes with the bottle. I used the nail clippers to cut his nails. I actually cut his thumbs. Be careful with that. I'm glad it wasn't sharper. I do like the new ergonomic handle. This would make an excellent shower gift."
2,NOT A GOOD BUY,"THE CASE IS NICE........THE NASAL ASPIRATER DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. I HAD TO GO OUT AND BUY MY OWN,SEPERATELY. THE THERMOMETER DOESN'T LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS DONE READING THE TEMPERATURE.( NO SOUND OR ANY THING) NAIL CLIPPERS WORK WELL. HAVE NOT USED MEDICINE SPOON YET."
3,...clippers and scissors,"I bought this kit and the grooming kit (both almost the same) and the clippers are not sharp and the scissors were not sharp enough either. the rest of the stuff was ok, but it seemed like the things you would use the most were not any good. I bought the sassy grooming kit (the bee, butterfly scissors, etc.) and that was excellent! If you're looking for a grooming kit, that's the one to get."
3,Clippers gone array.....,"The clippers are cheap! They broke way before they literally broke {only one side would cut my son's nails and then they fell apart}! The digital themometer worked okay but you should invest in a better one specifically for the anus. Sounds lovely huh? The aspirator is great, it's small enough as to not scare your child more than they already might be of this little sucker yet strong enough to free up that nasal area in no time."
2,You don't need this stuff as much as you think you do.,"I bought this, or rather asked for it as a gift, and it has been uneccesary. You get an aspirator from the hospital, and the nail clippers just don't work and I have always been given medicine droppers or spoons from the pharmacist if I request it. Thermometers are a dime a dozen and while it is nice to have a digital one so you can get the temp under the arm more easily, I never use it. I use my ear thermometer insetad,...which is easier with an old fashioned one. Buy little nail files at first anyway, they are the easiest way to clip nails for newborns. After that we went directly to little scissors."
2,Not worth it,The only thing worth keeping in this Kit is the nail clippers. You normally get an aspirator from the hospital and all the other itsms are not really needed. I suggest buying the nail clippers separately.
3,overall useful,"I agree that the aspirator does not work as well as the one you get from the hospital - but I brought home two of them from the hospital & my cats have managed to hide both of them! Yeah, you can buy these items seperately, but it is sometimes nice to have extras, or all in one place."
4,"This ""Care Kit"" is just as good as any of them out there!","I have this item for my son along with a few other different ""Care Kits."" I think they all have their pro's and con's, but this one is adequate just like the rest. The thermometer is not for under your arm. Three month old babies should have their temperature taken rectally. It would be nice if it beeped. The syringe is great and I also use the clippers. I had luck using both the medicine dropper and spoon. You may not use all of the items now, but you will eventually. They are good to have on hand in a pinch. I recommend this to anyone and if you receive it as a gift, why complain? It was free. Return it or exchange it."
2,Wouldn't purchase again,"It's kind of bulky for a diaper bag, which is why I got it. The clippers are not good quality. The thermometer is cheap. It has a little ""f"" for fahrenheit that blinks until it is done reading. The ""f"" is very little and hard to see when trying to hold a squirming 5-week old. It also takes a while to read."
1,Needless Thing,"The only thing that I have really used out of it has been the nail clippers. Otherwise, I wasted the money on it and could have put it towards something more useful. Well, I guess you and learn. It was my first baby, everything looks great and needed."
4,Great For Diaper Bags of keeping medicine cabinet neat!,"I hated seeing the negative reviews for this product, so i thought i would add one on here. I recieved this item at my baby shower, and i think its great! Instead of just throwing these things in your medicine cabinet and diaper bag it keeps them nice and neat. This is all stuff you will use at somepoint or another. The pouch is small enough that it doesnt take up alot of room. what more could you ask for! i like to keep my stuff organized, and this item is a big help with that. Yes, you could buy these things seperatly, but its just as easy to get this and have the zipper pouch. The items in it are all of good quality too."
3,an ok purchase,Like most of the other parents I don't really think it's worth the buy. The nail clippers seem really dull and don't cut my son's nails; i just use a very soft nail file. The nose sucker is great for when baby first comes home because of the small nostrils little babies have; the one from the hospital was too big for our son at first. I also enjoy this kit because the hospital didn't give us anything! If they made some improvements this would be a great kit.
2,Keep the nasal bulb from the hospital!!,"This kit is so-so. The nasal bulb is too pointy to stick up my son's nose. The one from the hospital is much better. I haven't used any of the other products because all meds come with their own droppers. The clippers are ok, but I have a hard time adjusting to the size of the handle."
2,Not a useful set,I have used the thermometer and the clippers period. The aspirator is terrible. The one that came home from the hospital with us is much better!!
2,Wendy - 2nd time around Mom.,"I like the idea of this small kit, perfect for the diaper bag, but the case is made very cheap. Zipper comes unzipped from both directions and will not zip back up. Also, I do not like the nose syrenge, it will not suction from my baby's nose at all. I have not used the other products yet, so I cannot fairly report on those."
2,Don't bother,I agree with the rest of the reviews. I registared for it because it looked like a great travel idea. I only use the nail clippers. They work great but you can buy them seperatly. The nasal suction is way to small. Plus I would use the one the hospital gives you. It is the worth the money at all. Registar for something more useful.
2,Buy each item as needed,"I bought this kit because it looked handy and compact, but have only used the nail clippers and the aspirator. The clippers are great. The aspirator barely works because the bulb is too small (in order to fit in the travel case) to get decent suction. Also, the tip was too large for my newborn's nose! The thermometer took a frustratingly long time to register the temperature when I tested it, so I haven't used it for real. I don't see any problem with the medicine dispensers, but haven't needed them. In hindsight, I should have just bought the clippers and used the aspirator and thermometer that the hospital gave us."
2,Never really has a use for,"Go with what the others have said. Buy separately. You will not use a lot of the stuff in this kit.1. Nasal aspirator - use the one the hospital gives you, it is ten times better.2. Thermometer - was not 100% accurate. I had to buy another one per my doctors request. Every time I took his temp it was different, and that is taking it out and putting it right back in with no time in between.3. Nail clippers are fine but there are much better out there. I found that the clippers with the little magnifying cover are fantastic, especially when your little one is a wiggle worm.4. Medicine syringe - I have never used. All baby meds come with their own built in syringe. Also they do not hold near as much air. Also the little white plastic cover is a pain to wash, dry, and it just gets in the way.5. Medicine spoon - I have never needed or used."
2,Buy Separately,"Ok, I'll admit, the nail clippers rock. I have no problem using them, they are sharp, cut evenly and are the perfect width. That said, throw everything else out. The bulb syringe is useless, keep the one that you get from the hospital. Get an ear thermometer, it's a heck of a lot easier. The spoon...not even going there. The med dropper isn't easy enough to use. My suggestion? Go find a syringe with a cork attachment. You take the top off the bottle, push the cork attachment into the opening. To use, flip back the attached lid and put the med syringe into the opening, flip the bottle over and draw the med into the syringe. This is the best way to do it."
2,Mostly Worthless,"We thought this kit was a necessity when we were preparing for baby, but we pretty much never get it out. All the medicines we give her from the store come with a dropper. The nasal aspirator we got from the hospital works a thousand times better than this one. This one is so small, and the rubber is harder and tougher to squeeze. However, the clippers are wonderful, and it is nice having two pairs (we also got them in the matching grooming kit) in case one pair is misplaced. I've used the thermometer in my daughter's armpit, and I believe it was accurate. But don't buy this kit just for the thermometer when you could buy a better one seperate, that beeps when it is ready to be read."
3,I didn't really need it,"the only thing i use in this is the nail clipers. i do like them alot though because they are easy to hold. i got everything else free from the hopital, so i guess the name hopital's choice does fit well. i would recomend you buy this after you have your baby it see if you really need it or not."
4,Has it all!,"I was given this as a gift from one of my students, and I use the clippers constantly. They are so much easier to use than the others on the market! The aspirator is smaller, and not quite as powerful as the one from the hospital, but it works almost as well. DO NOT buy the aspirator that has an opening on the end to ""clean"" it. It smells of plastic and is extremely difficult to use because it is hard to squeeze. Don't waste your money. I haven't used the other pieces yet, but they seem to work ok."
1,Flimsy items,"I also purchased this item without really investigating its contents. The nasal sucker thing doesn't work nearly as good as the one you get from the hospital, the medicine dropper is horrible, the clippers didn't work properly and the other medicine distributor was clearly for an older child. The items were flimsy and were tossed aside quickly."
3,separates,"I don't have this set, but I do have the items. I got the thermomator in a two pack from saftey first, it cam e with a regular white thermomator. I never could get the clear one to work and I tried often over a year. I can't get it to give a reading, and it's not the batteries I don't think. The white one worked much better and was accurate. The nose thingy doesn't work at all. the thick band of rubber around the middle of the buylb makes it hard to sqeeze for me and it doesn't suck right. I just went back to the hospital after birth center and they gave me a new one and showed me how to use it. The nail clippers I have are the same, mine just don't have the little bulb handle. They work extremely well, I have very small hands so i don't need the buld on the end."
2,Not useful,This product was not useful. Most of the items in it we got from the hospital which worked much better than the ones in this kit.
2,Don't like the thermometer,"My baby is 3 months and so far the only thing I've used is the thermometer, which I absolutely hate. It does not beep, so you have to constantly watch the stupid thing to see when it stops flashing. It's supposed to be very quick but it always takes me several minutes to get an accurate temperature. When you have a newborn and are trying to keep it under their arm while keeping them still and try to watch the thermometer at the same time it gets frustrating. Why the thing can't beep is beyond me but I do not recommend this."
3,OK,"The only 2 things from this kit that Ive used are the nail clippers and the bulb syringe. The clippers have a longer handle (if that's what you want to call it) but I wish it was a little more ergonomical, like an indent for your finger instead of a bulge. The syringe worked well when my daughter was congested. I keep this kit in her diaper bag that goes with her to her sitter every day. I also can add a few more things in it, like a bottle of Mylecon and Children's Tylenol (just in case she ever needs it), and everything is in one spot."
3,Could be more practical,"This is a very cute idea...however, not all that great for a newborn...I didn't like the aspirator..it didn't work all that well for my baby. And then we ended up buying a different thermometer; the kind that is like a pacifier. The medicine dispenser is good though."
1,Regret buying it,"I had to buy this because my husband was having a heart attack about how much we were spending on everything. It is not worth it, even though it was inexpensive. The thermometer takes forever, the dropper doesn't work, the nail clippers are horrible and the suction's hole is too big. Spend the extra $ and save yourself the hassle."
2,Not so useful,"It looks great as a shower gift, but I have only used the clippers from this set. The other pieces arent as useful as other items on the market. I ended up buying everything seperately."
2,Not needed,"We got this for our shower. Our son is now 2 and the only thing we've used is the nail clippers. Which I actually really like the shape of them cause they are a lot easier to hold then just the tiny clippers, especially if baby starts to squirm a little. I couldn't even tell you where the rest of it is. The spoon thing and dropper for the medicine is cheap and useless. Any baby medication you buy you'll get a dropper for which works way better. The bulb didn't work well at all, just keep the one you get in the hospital, those work best! And if my little guy was sick he didnt appreciate having to sit still while I tried to take his temp. I recomend a therma scan for that. Just a quick beep in the ear and your good to go.So basicly, I would recommend to pass on this item and just get a pair of nail clippers."
4,It's alright...,This is a okay deal if you actually use all of the items included. I received this as a shower gift and the only thing that I have used is the nail clippers and the thermometer. You get the aspirator from the hospital and the medicine droppers are already included whenever you buy medicines. I guess if you need replacements for stuff you would use these items. Overall a good value...but you gotta use it!
4,Good to have as extras,"True, the hospital gives you an aspirator (which is better than any one you can buy) and a thermometer (ditto), and you get the droppers with each medicine prescription, but I've found that it's good to have extras so I'm thankful I received this as a shower gift. I constantly loose the clippers, tmeter, and droppers (we have a 2 story house) so it's nice I have a backup someplace safe when I need it. I actually keep this set in my diaper bag and I as well as his sitters have used it several times. I think the entire set is a necessary item!"
2,Save your money,"My main problem with this set is that it seems to be for babies of all different ages. The asperator is for a younger kid than the medicine dispensers, and really, why do you need the two different dispensers in the same kit? If I had it to do over, I would just buy the individual items that I needed. I got a free asperator at the hospital, I already own multiple digital thermometers, medicine dispensers come with the medicine, and I am left spending [money]for a pair of nail clippers."
2,Not necessary...,It may seem nice to have everything in a kit but a lot of the items are not needed. I've only used the thermometer. I agree with others about buying what you need separately. The quality will be much better.
5,Excellent soap,Liked it and will buy again. I feel that my skin is less irritated than with Gilette stuff in cans.
4,Does the job well,"This was the soap that came with the shaving kit I recently purchased. I enjoyed the aroma. It gave best coverage when it was more watery than I like. For that reason, there are others I would probably get before buying this again, but that does not mean it is bad. It's just runny is all."
5,Schick Intuition Refills - Excellent Bargain,I received these refills very quickly. Item was exactly as described. This is an excellent deal and I definitely recommend this seller.
2,not quite right,These refill cartridges are just off... the smell is off scent and the blades don't seem to be seated right. I keep getting mild razor burn when I use the blades from this order. I've been using this razor for years and have never had this type of problem with any of my other refill purchases (primarily from retail stores). If I didn't throw away the box already I would definitely return them.
3,Ridiculous price but great for tired mom,"These are REALLY pricy for a horrifically flimsy, cheap razor. However, I hardly get 5 minutes for a shower most days and this is the only way I can get a shave. So... kudos for the great idea. However, they barely last a few shaves and they become dull very quickly (way faster than the soap runs out) and then look out for nicks! Also, since they get dull quick you have to go back over the same place multiple times. It is a shame really, because I love the idea, but even dollar store razors are better quality. I have very sensitive skin, even so, this does not irritate it at all (except for when I get a nick). If you could combine the idea with the razor from Venus system it would be a 5 star product."
2,Not Quite What I Expected,"I would have to agree with another reviewer who said that something just isn't quite right with these blades. They don't look right and don't smell right. I purchased this item based on prior reviews, stating that these were a good item. There are many other Intuition blades from other sellers that have received less than stellar reviews, such as not being the correct product, so I decided to purchase this one.I haven't used the 3 blade refills since they came out with the 4 blade, so I don't remember exactly what the 3 blade looked like, but these look like cheap blades inserted in the lather bar, rather than what I'm used to with the 4 blade. They seem to work ok, but I was just disappointed in receiving something that seems to be a knock-off, or old product.I will be going back to purchasing these from Sam's Club, which sells 12 for $28...and I know that they are 4 blades and the real thing."
1,what a piece of crap!!,I keep trying to give romances a try but they just keep falling short. This book was horrifying with some of the descriptions. I kept trying to get past the one-liners and just keep reading--but it was painful. Everything about this book was utterly predictable and the characters had hardly any endearing qualities. I swear it felt like I wrote this book when I was 9.
1,couoldn't make it past chapter 5.......,"To be fair, contemporary is not my favorite genre but I love military stories so gave this one a look. This book however turned me off early on. Our angst ridden special ops guy drags himself to the family home of a young man killed in his unit. You can feel his dread and feel how difficult it must be....esp as we see the results of war every day in our real lives......but the author loses me when Luke walks into the greenhouse and finds the guy's (calvin's)widow......in a mini top, short shorts, pony tail and bebopping to a loud stereo........This bereaved widow looks like a teen ager and obviously is acting like one......and for me that takes the seriousness of the plot/story line right out of reality. I tried very hard to continue and did for a couple of chapters but I never saw any improvement..........sorry, ms crandall.........."
3,Comments on Lunch or Dinner!,"To Whom It Is Concerned:I am not pleased, because I though that I was purchasin the entire album, not a CD single!Regretfully yours,C.Scott"
2,junk.,first time I used it the tip popped off with no excess force added at all. but for seven bucks I guess I cant say much. still though this is disappointing.
4,"Nice Price, Decent Product","Not sure if other reviewers have noted this, but the tip that is provided with the iron does work. However, it seems to wear down pretty fast at extended high heat. Not bad though, got the job done, it'll sit in a box until i need it again."
4,A good deal for the price,"For the price even if you only use the iron a few times it's a good value. I still had tough tough time getting 3% silver solder to flow with it and if you plan on using silver solder I would recommend a higher wattage unit. It works well with 60/40 solder. The tip is fairly lightweight and mine has bent after a few uses, probably wouldn't have happened if I wasn't using silver solder."
3,Use only for basic stuff,"If you're going to be messing around with circuit boards and stuff, go look for a better iron. If you're just soldering wires together this is fine."
2,Perhaps consider something else,"My wife bought this for my Christmas gift because I was beginning into circuits. A couple of tries with this soldering iron and I felt I liked it! Today, I noticed something very odd is the fact that when I went to Tin the wire - the solder wouldn't melt like it would normally. It burned up the perf board pretty well and I just felt defeated! At first, I wasn't sure if it was the solder free soldering dispenser I am using or if it was the actual iron itself. The soldering iron does get hot but keep in mind - this can damage components as well! I suppose if you are interested in getting this solder - just be sure you take caution and note that this is after all a 6 dollar soldering iron. I'll be looking into a much better soldering iron station next time!"
4,Cheap soldering iron,Does what its supposed to. Handle could be better insulated as it gets pretty warm. For the price you cant go wrong
3,"Soldering gun works, but tip melted.","Bought this to fix the fan connector on my ps3. While the gun itself worked excellent, the soldering tip that was sent with the gun melted during use. I decided to borrow one of my dad's soldering tips and was able to fix the problem. So I give the gun itself 4 stars, but I'd advise you to replace the tip before use."
2,"Pass on this if, you can. If not, it still works and it's cheap.","This thing takes FAR too long to get hot. This means it takes FAR too long to get hot enough to actually melt the solder. It will eventually get hot, but your arms might be tired before it does."
5,Strong enough for 12 gauge wire,"I used this to solder some 12 gauge speaker wire onto banana plugs and onto receiver terminals after breaking several of the spring-clip style connectors that it uses for the surrounds. My lower-wattage iron wasn't able to heat the wire up enough to allow for proper soldering, but this one didn't have any problem with the task.For the price, I doubt you'll find anything better!"
2,"If your rosin is lead-free, don't buy this","As the title says, for lead-free rosin wiring projects, don't use this iron. It heats unevenly and is not hot enough to melt the wire consistently. Get a different/hotter iron."
5,Perfect for plastic welding,I had a fairly large crack in the cowl of my ski doo snowmobile and didnt want to spend hundreds on a new one. I did some research on Youtube and watched several videos on plastic welding with a soldering iron. I purchased this one because it's a 60 watt which gets very hot as opposed to the 40 watt that would not get hot enough for my purposes. After a few spot welds on the inside of the cowl I slowly ran it down the length of the crack to weld it back together. It worked like a charm! It must be said that this was my first attempt at welding a plastic (polyurethane) cowl and am no means an expert. Before attempting to weld plastic do some research to see what kind of material your cowl is made of because I have read that there are some plastics that will not accept heat as a means to fix it and an appoxy must be used.
2,ehh,"it worked ok the temp was JUUUUST a little to cold and i had some issues with getting the solder to melt before the wire insulation started to get soft and distorted. i kinda got frustrated went to my local harbor freight bought the ""hoby"" soldering iorn kit thing and have been using that since. not sure if i just got a bad one or if they are all like this i bought the same brand just a much larger size and it works GREAT?? so figure that one out?"
3,no complaits for its price,"well, its cheap and it works, I am not so enthused cause the one I got the tip was a little dull, I could have used a little sharper tip. I am guessing it was just my bad luck cause I am thinking it was a factory defect but it does the job well, just not too happy with the tip."
2,Inexpensive but also cheap,"It heats up well, but also gets a bit too hot for the design. The handle gets hot enough to notice with your hands, although not dangerously so.The biggest problem I had with this item is the tip. It is junk and started to disintegrate after about 30 mins of use. Once that happens, a 5 second soldering job becomes a 2 minute job--frustrating and not good for the blood pressure. I switched to a higher quality soldering item and it increased my efficiency by 3-5 fold. This might be okay for occassional one-time solder jobs, but if you need to do a lot of soldering, get a better model iron or you'll wish you had."
2,Not exactly the perfect iron.,I needed a soldering iron for work in rewiring my classic car and also for small wiring projects with Radio Control airplane components. This iron takes an extremely long time to reach operating temperature and is a little clumsy to use. I was much happier with my cordless soldering iron which would heat up instantly and transfer heat to the project better. I will purchase another cordless unit and probably not use this one except for larger jobs or if the battery on the cordless needs rechargeing.
4,Great for the price,"Nice little soldering iron. Gets hot fairly quickly, hot enough to melt solder easily. Comes with a folding stand. Stand is flimsy and kind of pointless. Cord for the soldering iron is a little short. Overall good purchase, complaints are very minor since the price is right for this item."
2,wow,i can not describe how displeased i am with this iron.... knew i was gonna have an issue with it as soon as i touched the solder to it and the solder crackled and hit me in the face.... then when wipping it on the wet sponge.... the tip just seemed to vanish...gets two stars cuz i can just buy a new tip.
3,it works,Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining? This works.
2,Soldering Iron,Soldering Iron burns very hot and easy to get burnt. Not for children.No safety to prevent touching heating element.
2,soldering iron,"plug it in to tin the tip, unplugging to let it cool and after plugging it back in the tip would not get hot enough to melt .065 soldier. has been returned."
4,"Works well, heats up quick","So far, no complaints. It works well, is comfortable and heats up quickly. The sheet metal stand functions nicely. Well worth the money."
4,Not bad,If I can get just a little bit of welling lead I would give it 5 stars. Other than that this is very nice.
2,Just anoher cheap product,"This product heats up, and does the job. However the build quality if quite flimsy and its not very good overall."
4,good cheap product that works good,as soon as i plugged it in i knew it was going to work good just lke it does. for the price this is it works good
2,"Cheap junk, not suited for electronics work","Yes, it's cheap. And it heats up. But that's about where it ends. Honestly, you should ask yourself what's wrong with it if it's being sold for $10. And the answer is a lot. Nothing specific broke or anything, but everything about this soldering iron is just shoddy. The tip is huge and imprecise and oxidizes easily. There's no temperature control. The plastic part gets got to the touch. The included stand is worthless. Etc. etc. etc. If you're doing any electronics work, save your money and buy a real temperature-controlled soldering iron set. If you're not paying more than $60, it's probably junk. This is no exception."
5,Excellent product,"I totally love this iron. Very powerful, and very stable. And all that for $7! After low quality RadioShack irons that go for $20 and power fluctuate like an autumn leaf, this was a great acquisition."
3,"Good, but not great","Fast shipping, easy to use, but it takes a looooooong time to get to full temperature. And its just over-all a fairly weak soldering iron. But, not bad at all for only $10"
4,Did the trick!,"I needed this to fix something on an electrical device. It did the trick very quickly. It was a small job and I haven't used it since, but I'm hoping it will work just as good whenever I need it."
4,worth buying,"in my opinion the standard sauder guns like these are the best, i do a lot of small electrical repair and ive used the fancy craftsman rechargeable ones and ect..., but all one needs is a basic sauder gun and a stand and ur ready to rock"
5,Works great,"Can't beat the price. The base hasn't melted yet as others have reported. 60 watts is a lot of power, almost wishing I bought a 40 watt."
5,good,"Good product. Holder could be better, but for the money great soldering iron. Heats up quick and perfect for those little jobs."
3,No Stand,The soldering iron came right on time....But When i open the package i did't see the stand that was included.
1,can not do the job,Here are my reasons:1. Solder will not stick to the tip2. Has a needle point tip rather than a chisel
2,Burnt Out.,"This was my first experience using a soldering iron. There was a learning curve. I learned that it wouldn't work without solder, not to panic when it started to smoke, and the tip was a little large for what I was using it for...Just about the time I was hopeful the iron and I had bonded it died. Perhaps it just got burnt out with my ineptness. In any case, I will give it two stars and share the blame."
5,Great soldering iron,"Heats up quickly and is easy to use. Definitely worth the money. I would recommend this if you are looking for a quick and cheap soldering iron, it compared to my brothers 50 dollar one."
3,Little lower quality than normal.,I know it uses only 60watts but I have used better one with lower price.So for plastic welding purpose it would be good enough but not for soldering.For thin diameters solder might be ok.
3,Great price but not hot enough for lead-free project,"I'll still keep this iron. I suppose I could use it to assist in dual iron, 60/40-base desoldering of bad capacitors. It easily puts out heat for lead-containing solder.It didn't put out enough heat to remove bad caps from a lead-free iMac G5 motherboard. I thought the 60 watts rating would do the job.I'm a bit disappointed, but this iron was inexpensive/free ship/within a larger order. I'll check out on the web what others have used to get the job done."
4,Conjunction,This product offers enough electrical resistance to tackle any job. On the down side handle is a little bit bulky. Overall solid product.
4,Fun book for collectors,"This is a fun book for collectors. I collect: Silver Age Comics, sports cards and Coca-cola mem. Lotza nice pics and was shocked to find a pic of A Star trek lunch box (!!) a very very rare find. This may also be fun for those children of the 1950's 60's and 70's who wanna blast from the past. An almost Strong Museum in a book."
1,Nothing short of an atrocity.,"The New Mutants was the first, and probably best, X-Men spin-offtitle. Claremont favored telling stories of character, there were many issues which didn't even contain a single battle. But that all ended with Rob Liefeld taking over the title. Although I have come to respect Rob Liefeld over the past few years, what he did with the New Mutants is unforgivable. He changed them from a group of trouble adolescents into a third-rate Teen Titans clones. This book reprints the issues which are the greatest tragedy that ever befell the X-Titles. Do not buy this book."
3,Skip the first 5 chapters,"The second half of Kerth's book (ch. 6-9) contains some helpful advice on conducting end-of-project reviews. Kerth makes little distinction between reviewing (a) the end product of the project and (b) the performance of the project team. I recommend these chapters to discerning experienced project leaders as a supplement to a comprehensive book on project management.The early chapters, on the other hand, are loaded with naive misconceptions, e.g. on what a ""successful project"" is and an obsession with measuring ""lines of code"". They could actually do harm if taken seriously by a naive manager.The self-indulgent writing may approach a record for use of the first-person pronoun."
4,"Good, Good, Great!","This is a short little CD, but it has ""Ya Viene El Sol"" on it. That's a great, upbeat song that they always play in concert (at least each time of the 4 that I've seen them) and I don't believe is on any other album (though I last looked back when I bought the CD). That song is definitely worth the price as a MP3 download, but the entire CD is worth it's price too. Get up and dance and feel good about life!!"
3,A Good but Understated Performance,"Devos' perfomance is the one that introduced me to Gossec's remarkable Requiem. And while this CD still has legs--largely because of Devos' scholarly devotion to and the score and obvious affection for the music--it emerges as a bit undercharacterized compared to the more recent performance by Diego Fasolis on Naxos 8554750-51.Part of the difference is that Naxos' recording is far more impactive, with telling presence in the brass and percussion utterances, compared to Devos' more reticent, genteel recording. But Fasolis and company also imbue the work with far more drama, and this is the most significant difference between the two CDs. Devos' performance suggests the grandeur of the Requiem; Fasolis' convinces that the Requiem is a great piece of music."
4,"When times get grubby, this is the book to have!","I first saw this book at the house of a friend of mine. Of course, I found the title very interesting. When I began thumbing through the book, I found it was hard to put down. Don Paul is obviously very experienced in the ways of outdoor survival. He is a great writer, and passes on his infomation to you in a very clear manner. Not to mention the fact that he is extremely humorous at times. One thing I especially enjoyed in this book was the section on how to pick out a guard dog in ""grubby times"". I think you will find it a very interesting theory. I would definetely reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in learning outdoor survival techniques, or who wants an enetertaining piece of reading."
2,Basic and great for beginners.,"This was not at all as I had hoped. The information is very simplistic; not only in verbage, but also content. All of the information in this book can be found in the most basic of websites about survival and E&E within a few moments searching. Diagrams are blurry and difficult to interpret. My suggestion is to save the money and spend a few hours searching online or purchase a book by Tappan or Nester. God Bless!"
3,Its ok... know some tricks for 'grubby times',"This book is entertaining but heavily geared toward the view that future society will somehow resemble 'Mad Max' or something. Various topics include: What weapon to pick for home defense, where to go in the world if society in the US crumbles, how to get around when there's no infrastructure, and how to make furniture out of large logs and a chainsaw. Lots of common sense stuff, a few interesting ideas of questionable usefulness, like making a guided bomb out of a remote control airplane or fitting your car with a shotgun mount. If society collapses, I don't think barricading in a survival shelter in the rural western US is going to be the most productive thing for alot of people, lots of books on self sufficiency will go way further than this book."
4,very small but works great,"I only had this a few days, it is small, but the air power is good, so I have no complais, it does what it is supposed to do. could have a longer metalic pipe in the front."
5,Small but does the trick,"Yes it's small, but it does put out a lot of air, seems durable and is effective in getting fires going. Price is right also. What more could you want?"
5,Amazing price for this item,"The price for this is great, it is is well made and works very well, overall i am very pleased."
2,Terrible,"I gave this 2 stars only because of Jackie Chan's presence. But then, he really isn't in all of ""Master With Cracked Fingers"". Apparently the filmmakers ran out of money and then tried to finish the film later, but Jackie is not in the whole movie. They substitute a very obvious imposter for him in many scenes. It is so obvious that it makes the story hard to follow, since from time to time a different character appears.Both films are in 4:3 format, and look like they were taken from bad VHS masters. They look and sound horrible. No matter how much you love Jackie (and I do), avoid this set!"
4,A disection of Marxism,"Heilbroner's Marxism: For and Against is an excellent, unbiased introduction to the scholarship of Karl Marx. Disecting it into four themes ((1) dialectical philosophy, (2)historical materialism, (3) socioanalysis of capitalism, and (4) a commitment to socialism), Heilbroner clearly illustrates the nature and logic of Marxism. In contrast to contemporary, mainstream misconceptions of Marxism, Heilbroner lays out the true underlying philosophy and theories of Marx in six concise, entertaining chapters. The book is a definite reader for anyone who wants to understand Marxism presented in a logically structured manner."
3,Not my favorite from this author,"I've read and enjoyed many books from Robert Heilbroner but this one simply didn't strike me as one his best works. Maybe it was the subject matter and it's dry content but usually Heilbroner has a knack for taking complicated economic subjects and then explain it easily AND in an interesting tone. Well, not this book. Again, maybe it was the subject matter. I haven't read enough books that try to dymystify Marx's thoughts so I don't feel qualified to agree or disagree with Heilbroner's conclusions. One of the ways I judge books is if the author does such a great job that he or she really motivate you to explore the subject further...this one does not. Sorry"
5,Wild Huckleberry Taffy - delicious!,"My husband bought some of this for me at Christmas - to say it is delicious is a tremendous understatement! This is absolutely THE best huckleberry taffy I've ever had! We used to buy huckleberry taffy in a store close to where we grew up, but living far away now, I'm so happy that he found a place to order an old favorite!"
4,How does he do it?,"How strong Harold Lloyd is to perform with apparent ease he physical feats of his bumbling adventures, His little dance he does in thr Freshman is hilarious."
2,Good for the first month or so...,"We are ""apartment dwellers"" and the idea of this tub folding up really attracted us to this product. It IS very compact and fit nicely into a nook in our tiny bathroom. Buy it does tend to leak at the hinges; I recommend using it inside the sink and not on a counter-top. It also is very shallow. It was perfect for those very first baths when you don't want too much water in the tub or possibly for a child who does not like baths. But my son is a bath lover and before he was even 6 weeks old we'd replaced it with a deeper tub to allow him to stay warmer and also to splash around more. If I could do it again I'd save my money (every little bit counts for us!) and just buy a bigger tub to begin with."
2,Good for Newborns - forget it after 12 lbs!,"I bought this tub, because I liked the fact that it folds and stores easily. It was great when my baby was a newborn, but now that he is almost 14 lbs - forget it! He bangs his head on the hinges and I always have to put a towel there so he won't hurt himself. The water leaks at the hinges, so you end up putting way too little water in it to avoid leaking. My baby loves to splash about and this is really not possible in this tub. I am now looking for something else!"
2,leaky and annoying,"I used this tub first, but soon decided that it was basically [bad] and moved on to just use my kitchen sink with a non-slip mat. This tub seems great before you actually use it, but when you fill it with water it leaks from the places where it ""folds"" and my newborn just splashed too much to make this useful at. all."
1,Not very sturdy...,"This tub is very flimsy, and doesn't fit well in my kitchen sink. The smaller side that folds, where the baby's feet would go, is especially vulnerable to any weight that might be applied to the tub. Baby looks uncomfortable, with legs scrunched in the bottom of the tub, and he's always sliding to one side. I've already thrown it away and invested in something safer."
3,Didn't feel the baby was safe,I started using this when my baby was a couple months old. It scared me. Seemed like the baby was too low no matter what I did. I went back to using one of those teddy bear shape foam bath mats till the baby could sit and then I just went right to the regular tub.
1,Lisa,I received this tub as a shower gift and was very disapointed. Because it is a fold up tub it leaks badly. I have a 10 lb baby and it is hard to position the baby so that the water will cover enough of her body.
2,Okay,"I had this tub with my first daughter. It was a perfect fit for the sink. I would not recommend using it without a sling for newborns because they slip down. The padding on mine also started to accumulate mildew, even though I washed, rinsed, and dried it after every use."
1,it's not worth the space it saves!,"The tub is meant for children under 6mos but you would not feel comfortable plaing a child with little neck and back strength in this very unsupportive tub. The foam is thin and you would have to keep one hand actively holding your baby's body at all times while bathing. Of course you never want to be out of hands reach with a child in the tub, but if you let go of your newborn for a second toput soap on a washcloth, he'she will fall over in this thing. As a new Mom, you want products that keep your hands free as possible."
3,"Eh, so so!","My daughter never really seemed comfortable, and very soon after she could sit up, I started giving her baths in the tub. It was difficult to wash her buttocks, back and ""girl stuff.""I also had trouble managing clean water rinses and such -- I'd try to open the drain hole, empty the tub's water into the sink without flipping the baby and the tub over or dropping them into the sink, then stopper up the drain hole, then rinse. At the time, my back just hurt too much to bend over our bathtub.Emptying the tub required quite the dexterity or I would get water everywhere! I missed 4 out of 5 times, and the tub filled is, of course, just too heavy to carry to the bathtub to empty."
1,waste of time & money!,this tub it totally uncomfortable and poorly made. safety first needs to get their act together because a lot of their products lately are poorly made!
3,Idea Nice -- Tub Too Small,"This is what I used with my first daughter who is now 7. I saved it in our attic and didn't register for another tub because I thought this was my favorite tub. The truth is I loved it because it folded up. I didn't want a big bath tub in my bathroom.It turns out this bathtub was too small for her (forget exactly at what month) and I had to go out and buy one of those big bathtubs I dreaded seeing in my bathroom. I purchased the Eurotub.We have a big counter in our bathroom so the Eurotub was truly the best choice for us because we can bathe her in it until she's 2 years of age.If you're planning to use the fold up tub short term then it's ok, but not for the long term."
4,Great tub!,"I used this tub with my son and boy do I miss it! We have the newborn-to-toddler tub with daughter and it's bulky, takes up tons of room and is no different than this one other than it doesn't fold up. I would much rather have the fold-up than the one we have now. They both work and get the job done but for space reasons being able to fold it and put out of the way is much nicer IMO..."
1,Unsafe for tiny feet!,There are two crevices where the tub folds up where my daughter's feet get stuck.
2,Not for Newborns,"This tub is definitely not for newborns, because of the way the seat sits up. My child always slid to the side. I used the newborn shelf bather until she was a little older and then she looked like she was folded up in the tub like a sitting position. I do not recommend this tub."
1,Piece of junk,"I got this tub because of its price and the fact that it folds up. I used it once on my countertop with no problem, but I decided to try it in the sink. While bathing my 3 week old ten pound son, the locking mechanism on one side snapped, collapsing the tub and scaring my son.I returned this tub immediately and purchased a solid model that can't snap like that. The Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub is MUCH better. It's a few dollars more and a bit bigger, but it's definitely worth it. I've had it for a few weeks now and my son absolutely loves the bath. It is much more secure than this tub and though it takes up more space in our small apartment, I would never go back to the Fold-Up Tub."
1,waste of money,"I thought that this tub looked neat because it folded up for easy storage and it had a foam cushion already in it, plus the price was great! This was the worst purchase I have made. My baby looked like she was ""folded"" when I put her in the bathtub and she slid sideways, because there arent any adjustments to the tub, so you can't raise it up and down. I would advice anyone looking for a tub to just purchase a 3 in 1 tub."
2,MORE CONS THAN PROS,"I USED THIS TUB FOR MY FIRST CHILD AND IT HAS ITS PROS AND CONS. A FEW OF THE PROS ARE, IT KEEPS YOUR BABY SITTING UP STRAIGHT. IT ALSO FOLDS CONVENIENTLY. THE CONS ARE, MY SON KEPT SLIPPING FROM SIDE TO SIDE, SO I HAD TO PUT A TOWEL ON EACH SIDE TO KEEP HIM FROM HITTING HIS HEAD ON THE HARD PLASTIC. HE ALWAYS SEEMED SO UNCOMFORTABLE, BECAUSE THE PLASTIC IS SO HARD. OVERTIME, THE YELLOW PAD STARTTED TO FALL OFF AND EVEN THOUGH I RINSED IT OUT REAL GOOD AFTER EACH BATH AND TURNED IT OVER TO DRY, IT STARTED COLLECTING MOLD. IT ALSO DOESN'T HOLD MUCH WATER, WHICH WOULD CAUSE MY SON TO SHAKE FROM BEING COLD. THE CRACKS IN THE SIDE CAUSE THE WATER TO LEAK OUT. DESPITE MY OWN PROS AND CONS, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT JUST BECAUSE THE PLASTIC IS SO HARD AND IT'S TOO UNCOMFORTABLE FOR A NEWBORN. I WON'T BE BUYING THIS AGAIN FOR MY NEXT CHILD."
2,baby tub,"I to thought this tub was a great idea. My newborn daughter had other ideas about it. I only got to use this once or twice because my daughter would much rather take a bath in the ""big tub"". Yes i also had a problem with water leaking out when i filled it up just enough to cover her and keep her comfortable. It was really hard for me to get the tub joints to lock in place and with just a kick frommy daghter it would fold. I also found that the little pad in there was no help. Is that there to prefent slipping? if so mine must be defective."
1,good idea but not worth the cost,"My sister-in-law lent this to me so I could use it when I went to my in-laws. I had my doubts whenever I inspected the tub before his bath, but I went ahead anyway. I could not put much water in the tub, not enough to even cover my son's genitals. Then there was not much padding on the tub and it was very slippery. My father-in-law held my son while I washed him and ran to the sink to get water to rinse him. To top it all off, the tub leaked all over the table and floor. I can understand that the idea was a good one, but the way this particular tub is constructed is just asking for a big mess!"
3,I use it for travel,"I travel alot with my kids, and when they're little, that's what I use it for. I load it up with the other things so I don't have to pack my full size tub. It works good for that, but I perfer my infant-toddler bathtub over this for at home."
2,"It's ok, but you get what you $ for","This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done. However:-it does not hold a lot of water, so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is:-it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap, wash cloth, or toys"
2,"It works, but not comfortable and fold up isn't great",My baby's toes get stuck in the holes in the area that folds up. It is not comfortable. I always put a foam bath mat in the tub to make it more comfortable.
2,Not for use with Newborn Baby,"I wanted to let new moms know that i don't recommend this tub for use with newborn babies. I received this tub as a shower gift and thought once looking at it that the tub would be wonderful. Once i started using the tub, my thoughts changed dramatically. It was extremely hard for me to bathe my daughter by myself. She slipped around constantly even while i tryed to hold her still. To add water to the tub to a level that covered my daughter enough to help keep her warm and comfortable, caused the water to flow out over the henges where the tub was assembled to be folded. I also just didn't like the position that it put my daughter in while using the tub. She looked extremely uncomfortable. This tub might be Ok for older babies but in my opinion not for newborns. So, Good Luck!"
2,Sorry to say but the bad reviews are right.,"I never wanted a tub because I was not impressed with anything I found but my sister got me this as a shower gift. I just don't think baby is comfortable in it. His leg was all scrunched up, his head fell to one side (unpadded, by the way), and it was hard to fit it over my bathroom sink because it's a small round thing. Anyway, before I had the baby, I bought my husband a bath head cushion (the kind you blow up) from Target which he never used (too girly I guess). Turns out it is the perfect cushion (it has suction cups) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths. It has grooves so baby's head doesn't flop everywhere. I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body. The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back. He just lies on the soft terry cloth. It's perfect."
4,GOOD TUB if used properly...,"I love the convenience of the fold-up tub! I have read some of these other reviews by people complaining about this tub. It's designed to fit in a kitchen sink, which it does just perfectly, and if it leaks into your sink who cares?? So far as the baby flopping around in it, I personally never have my daughter in the tub without having a hand on her. Putting a towel in the bottom of it also keeps the baby from slipping, and gives a little extra padding as well. My only complaint about it is yes, I wish it was a little deeper. But my 4-month old (who is about the size of a 7-month old) still sits in it fine, and she loves bath time. I can't argue with that! All in all this is a great tub for anyone looking to save space and money!"
1,Dangerous!,"At first - this tub was fine...then one day we were having a bath and the plastic hinge broke sending my infant plunging into the sink. The tub is dangerous, defective and a piece of junk. Don't buy it!"
5,Excellent compact tub,This is a great starter tub for your baby. It folds up and fits into the smallest sink! Hannah is now almost 6 months old - 23 inches and 14 lbs and still fits into the tub..altho will be growing out of it in a minute. In our small kitchen we're able to fold up the tub and store it under our kitchen table b/c we're lacking on closet space.The only issue is that in the beginning she used to slide a bit over to the side. We got into the habit of laying a washcloth or burp cloth underneath her to keep her from sliding.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this tub for the convience. I thought having a folding tub to store would be much easier. My infant gets her feet caught in the sides of the tub and screams! It hurts her poor feet. Also she slides all over the place her head usually ends up propped up against the side which is not comfortable. Also it does not hold much water so you end up having to dump water out just to have enough room to rinse her off and she stays cold the whole time.I would imagine it would not work well for older babies either, it is almost too small for her and she is only 10 lbs. I hope this helps someone!"
2,Better for newborns,"My daughter is now 4 1/2 months old and although I liked the tub at first, I'm throwing it away after tonight's bath. We have a double sink, but one side is larger than the other, which is the side we put the tub in. Today, while bathing her, the clamps on the folding side snapped and the tub, and baby!!!, fell into the sink. Thankfully, she was fine, but both her and mom we a bit frazzeled after that! I would suggest this tub be used only for smaller babies, as she is now 15 1/2 lbs and I think too big for this tub. I also think that perhaps a regular double sink would work better because too much pressure gets put on the ""flap"" when you have the larger sink like we do. Not a bad product per se, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,A tub that leaks!,I wish I would have looked into other tubs before putting this one on my baby registry. It leaks because it folds up. So you can't put to much water in it. If you use it in your regular tub then it works better but that makes washing baby more difficult. The way my son sat it in was awkward too and wasn't easy to wash him. Shop around and put your baby in the tubs before buying one. I wish I would have done that.
3,A repeat buyer....,We first bought this tub for our son 3 yrs ago. Really enjoyed using it and he enjoyed bathing in it. Had no problems with it leaking anywhere. Folded up nicely for storage after letting it dry out. We are now registered for another for our new baby due soon.
1,DANGEROUS ITEM,The clips that hold the tub open are made of plastic - the screws that hold the clip in ripped through the clip causing the tub to crash into the sink and fold up. Thank god I was holding my baby's head at the time otherwise I'd be suing saftey first instead of writing this. Please do not buy a tub that folds. This can happen to you and your baby and you may not walk away from the accident as lucky as we have.
2,Not the greatest,"My wife and I found this tub hard to work with. Minimal support for our son, and he look extremely uncomfortable in the tub. I would not recommend."
2,Not the Best Baby Tub,"There were definitely problems w/this tub. My baby's feet did get stuck in the hinges as others have mentioned. Also, if you try to put much water in it, it leaks. Try to shop around. Since my baby has gotten bigger, the little bather stands have worked best for us. This tub made us dread bath time."
2,too small,doesn't hold much water and is too small for baby. Doesn't have good head support for the baby. End up returning this item and bought the Infant-to-Toddler Deluxe Comfort tub. Like it much better than this.
2,doesn't hold enough water to cover baby,"because it folds up, it doesn't hold enough water to cover baby to keep him warm. Nice portability however."
3,good for a smaller baby,"my son, who is 16 pounds at three months is almost too big for this tub. other than the size thing, this tub is great! it fits neatly under the sink when not in use and fits perfectly in my kitchen sink at bathtime."
2,Florida Mom,"If I could do it all over, I would not choose this tub. When my daughter was a newborn she would wiggle around and get her foot caught in the area where the tub folds. This pinches the baby's skin. Now that she is 4 months old she already seems to be too big for the tub. I bought the tub for the conveinence of folding it up but I rarely put it away in a cabinet so I would have been much better off with a different tub."
3,I didn't care for it...,"Maybe if I had more room to sit this tub... or maybe if I had given it another chance, but I really didn't care for this tub.I would have liked to had a little more water, a few less leaks and little more stability.We have moved to the big tub with one of the little elevated bath tub bouncy seats. My 2 1/2 month old likes it much more and I do too!"
3,Baby has already outgrown,"My baby is 5 months old and has already outgrown this tub. It is great when you have a newborn but, the water capacity isn't great and alot of it drains out. My baby is always cold. It turns into a bath marathon to get her out before she gets too cold. Already have to purchase a new bathtub or just bathe her in the regular tub."
3,Not So Bad,This tub served its purpose for me. I never had any problems w/ it. I give it only 3 stars b/c I think most babies (like mine did) will outgrow it very fast. It is lightweight and compact which is why a baby will outgrow it and why it is convenient to store. It all depends on your needs.
4,Great tub,"My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born. We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she's 4 months old. I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily. It does leak at the hinges. My daughter is very comfortable in it. Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm. It does fit in the kitchen sink though. I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub. It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher. She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room. It is a great tub, and a great price!"
1,"Easy to store, but that's it","This tub is easy to store but dangerous! The locking mechanism on it snapped one day while I was bathing my son! I guess if you set it on the counter instead of the sink it would be alright, but there are so many others out there that are safer. Also his toes kept getting pinched in the crack where the tub folds up when he would kick his feet. I would not recommend this tub."
1,Injured baby,"This is a great tub if your trying to save space but where the tub folds there are grooves inside the tub that my newborn son caught his foot in twice and now that he is a bit bigger he catches his fingers in the top part where it folds. I do not recommend this for newborns, maybe after the baby is long enough that his/her legs and arms are not right next to the hinges."
1,Very DANGEROUS TUB,I agree with 'Kat' from Utah. I had the same exact experience with this tub. The tub had collapsed with my infant son in it! Thank goodness I had a hold on him!DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT-IT IS SO DANGEROUS!The idea is good in theory however NOT in safety. And safety must come first not convenience when it comes to our babies.
2,"great for storage , uncomfortable, messy","I registered for this tub because I could fold it up and keep it under the sink. It was fine for my newborn, but at 2 1/2 months my baby hated the angle she had to sit. She had to be in a sitting position with her legs bent. Also, it cannot be used on the counter. It works great in the kitchen sink, but when we moved to the bathroom for warmth, water leaked out of the folds onto the counter and floor...what a slippery, dangerous mess!"
3,not perfect....but....,"This tub is convenient because I can fold it up and store it under my son's dresser. My son was a big baby....well over 9 pounds by the time of his first tub bath, and now he is almost 14 pounds at 7 weeks. His head constantly slides to the side, and there is only hard plastic on the sides, so, bath time has not been a fun experience. I am going to start putting a rolled towel on the side, so that his head willl be cushioned. They should have thought of this, and made a head cushion out of the foam liner, but, I don't know of many tubs where this wouldn't be the same problem. As far as holding only a little water, I just let the water run the whole time he is in the tub, and leave the drain open, so he has a constant stream of clean, warm water on him."
2,good and bad,"This tub has it's good and bad points. It worked out really well for my daughter when she was a newborn, it was shallow and I never had to worry about the water level being to high. Although this same thing ended up being the bad too! As she got older and started enjoying her baths, the tub just wasn't deep enough to submerge her. The only thing that was underwater was her bottom! The folding feature was nice for storage because it didn't take up a lot of room but all in all I don't think this is the ""perfect"" tub if your baby actually enjoys a bath. My daughter grew out of it by three months!"
1,Did not like this tub,I liked that I could store it and that it fit in the sink. What I didn't like about it is that the baby doesn't lay comfortable in the tub. Also the baby gets cold because of the design. I recommend the Eurobath its a five star.
1,Don't waste money on this one.,"We just had our 3rd child--so when I saw this bath tub, I thought it would be the perfect tub. The folding was nice for storing purposes, but that was the only benefit to this tub. I quickly found out that you can only put a little water in the bottom of it. When I put our newborn in it (8 lbs), the water didn't even reach his umbilical cord. He was freezing, and it was a terrible experience! Also, the tub only fits in square sinks. Our bathrooms have oval sinks, so the tub didn't fit in the sink, and I wasn't about to freeze him even more by going to the kitchen sink! I've since bought a Primo EuroBath--wonderful! Worth every penny!"
1,Brrrrrrrrrrr.......,"I got this tub from a friend before the birth of my first daughter and used it because I didn't know there was a range of quality in baby tubs. My daughter STAYED cold (I had to turn up the heat to 80 in the house before bath time so she didn't freeze when being bathed!) while she was being bathed and the yellow ""padding"" does not prevent the baby from moving EVERYWHERE when you add water! It also was only good for a month or so because it is pretty small.I hated this tub and wouldn't recommend it to an enemy! Its only redeeming quality is that you can perch it on the kitchen sink - - but really, it's not even worth paying the money for that one quality. I have purchased a Eurobath for my second daughter and highly recommend it instead of this tub!"
2,Cold and scary,"The folding design and the fact that the tup fits easily into the kitchen sink is convenient. But only my daughter's bottom remains in the water, the rest of her is left out in the cold! The angle of the tub leaves her feeling like she's about to fall over - after 8-10 baths the look of terror on her face still broke my heart each time. We bought a second tub, different model of course."
1,Not so comfortable,"I received this tub at my shower and wish now that I would not have registered for it. I liked the idea that it folded up and had a foam seat. But because, of the steep incline my daughter was very uncomfortable and the foam backing is not soft. She was also very unstable in that she would roll from side to side; I had to constantly keep one hand on her. I also found it impossible to wash her backside. I have not and would not recommend it to anyone. I ended up purchasing a flat foam bath, as it was very soft and easy to wash front and back. Now that she can sit up, I bought an inflatable tub and it's wonderful."
1,Think twice before purchasing this!,"I had this bath tub for my daughter and had problems with it each time I used it. The fold-up concept is great, but as the baby moves the water in the tub sloshes around, seeps out of the hinged areas of the tub, and gets all over your counter. In order to prevent this problem, you have to put so little water in the tub, your baby will hardly get wet. Also, the pad on mine came unstuck. I called the company and they replaced it but the same thing happened that time. I would think twice before purchasing this tub. If space is really a concern for you, perhaps you can overlook all of its downfalls. I purchased a different tub when my son was born and although it takes up more storage space, I love it!"
2,baby doesn't slip...but doesn't like it either,"This is a nice bath tub in that it is made for an infant, so the babies don't slip into the water. However, the water is ery shallow and it made my baby feel very insecure. he would scream the whole time I gave him a bath. So he and I began taking baths together in the big tub and the problem was solved as long as I kept a good grip on the little guy. There may be better bath tubs out there...but this one was a disappointment and I recommend just hopping in the big tub."
4,just right for us,"This tub was given as a gift for our first baby. Along with it, we were given one of those bath sponges that you lay in the tub and then set the baby in. We couldn't have been happier with it. It was shallow enough that with the sponge, the baby was snuggled just right. She didn't slide anywhere. It fit right onto our kitchen sink and when she was a little older we would put some water in our big bathtub and then put her into it with her tub. She was still secure in her tub but able to enjoy her bath even more."
2,not so great,this tub does leak-so it must be used in a sink or tub. my baby was 23 inches and over 8 pounds when he was born so we only got about 2 months use out of this tub--it really should be listed as a newborn tub.
5,Great for Grandma's house,"My Grandmother got this tub for my 3 month old son to use while visiting. It isn't as spacious as the tub we use at home, which is a little smaller than most tubs, but it folds up nicely, and it feels very safe and sturdy-not flimsy at all. I use both tubs in the big bathtub, so leaking isn't a problem for me. My son seems comfortable, but he prefers to have more water to splash in than this one holds. This tub is great for grandma's house, or if space is tight."
5,Great newborn tub!,"This tub is incredible for a newborn. It's non-skid surface really helps hold baby in place, and it's size makes it very easy to bathe your baby. It folds up nicely & we stored it under the bathroom sink. However, after a couple of months, we moved our daughter into a bigger tub so that she could kick her feet & move around more. I will definitely use this tub again for our next newborn!"
3,Not for BIG babies,"I received this tub as a baby gift, it works great though, can fit in the sink, and foldable for easy storage. One thing though is,it is not for big babies, My son outgrew it quickly when he was about 3 months."
2,Not the greatest,"This item was given to me as a gift and its not bad when comes to getting the job done, but it could be better. First of all, it leaks so its best to keep it in the sink if it fits. Second, it doesnt hold enough water to keep my daughter warm, her feet stick up in the air freezing. Her stomach is also exposed so I suggest keeping a warm washcloth over it. Also, if you have a smaller baby, they tend to slide all over the place so unless you have that sponge bear that sits in the tub, dont purchase this item."
3,So-so for a Short Time,"I have a small house with very little storage space, so I purchased this tub as a solution. It was a fairly decent tub while my son was very small, but he outgrew it after only a few months. It feels a bit flimsy--even though it is a fold-up tub, I believe they could have made it a bit sturdier. Also, the rubber padding started to peel off after the first month. In spite of this, it worked okay given our space constraints. I switched to the Safer Bather and love it!"
1,Waste of money,I bought this tub for my newborn and it is a JOKE! THe yellow backing does NOT keep the baby from slipping adn going from side to side in the tub. Her feet get caught in the hinge too and is painful. It DOES NOT fit in my kitchen sink as others have stated. It is too big to the sink. She screams really bad every time we bathe her because she does not feel secure with all the slipping. I would recommend spending a little mre adn getting a different tub for newborns...
4,It worked well for my twins!,"While it didn't hold a lot of water (for safety reasons, I suppose) it was comfortable and did the job for my babies.We even extended its use to 9 months. It was worth the money not to have to bend over a big bathtub with floppy-head babies."
1,NOT GOOD FOR BABIES OVER A FEW MONTHS OLD,"This tub is great for newborns, but after baby starts to sit up it becomes very uncomfortable. The bump near the bottom is too high causing his legs to be bent up, like frog legs, which makes it too difficult for baby to sit up or recline properly. I would not recommend this tub at all. Also, the fold up feature is useless, how often will you be folding up the tub, when you usually bath baby everyday and it needs time to dry before folding up anyway."
1,"Too small, cold baby!!","We received three baby tubs at our showers, so I sent this one to my mom's to use when we are there. I'm so glad I did. I wouldn't want to have this one at home to use all the time. It's just too small. Only our little guy's tushy was in the water. He normally loves bath time, but he fusses when we use this one because he's too cold. Save your money!!"
5,Great for small homes/apartments,"I love this thing, all the advantages of a full size bath with a special twist. I live in a very small house and this was perfect for my needs. It folds easily, the baby fits in the bath tub as if it was any other bath. I do not see any pinching hazards due to it being a folding tub. Mat is easily cleaned as it is not to porous. Would recommend, especially if you have limited space."
3,I'm not so sure about this tub...,"Well, It is practical becasue it is easy to fold away and saves some space, it was some what comfortable I suppose.How another lady had mentioned, there is no padding around the sides of the head area, two other things I worried about was that my son's delicate little fingers would get caught under this litte space/area where the tub folds from the head area, and also that his little feet might get caught in the folding foot area, and guess what? they did! not too horribly but it was still scary.But worrying about the smallest things and inspecting every little angle of something that your baby will use comes with the territory of being a parent.It was better though as my son got older, but he was definitely out of it by the time he was six months."
2,Not much of a TUB,"If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you... except that you'll only use it for 3 months because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space. As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that. And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at. Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)"
2,A so-so solution if you don't have much space,"The good features of this tub:stores easily-takes up very little spacehas a nice sponge pad to reduce slippinghas a little holding area at baby's feet for soap, sponge, etc.Unfortunately, the bad features are pretty bad:maximum water level is only high enough to keep a 7-week-old's bottom wet (and warm) - the rest is all out of the waterit is not contoured from side to side, so baby slips and slouches diagonally in the tub, resting his head on one of the hinges.That said, we are using this tub again with the second child, but I think it will only be useful for a few weeks. We are already placing it into the big tub and using it there, which erases any benefit to the parent of not having to bend over.If we had the space, I would definitely use a different tub."
1,Uncomfy for baby,"We bought this tub before our son was born thinking it looked safe & easy to use. I put him in it once & it was obvious that it was uncomfortable & he had too much room to wriggle about. It just made him scream, and after more thought I realized you'd have to fill it with towels to make it feel cozy & cushy to an infant whose already being overloaded with new experiences. It was much easier, and more fun, to just put him in a regular bath with me on my lap where I could hold him & he could feel the warmth & security of my skin. Save yourself the money!"
2,not too safe,"l got this as a gift on my baby shower and wish l couldhave gotten another one... b/c when l take my son a bathhe slides everywhere! l have to hold him all the time lcan not let go of him, it's kinda hard when you are trying to wash him and holding at the same time. would not recomed."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This tub is NOT what I had on my registry, but my cheap mother-in-law went with this tub. This tub does not hold much water, the baby does not like how damn hard the plastic is (there is no cushioning or softness anywhere; she hates this thing!). Sure, it's easy to clean and easy to store, but it is EXTREMELY difficult to give baby a bath by yourself and just difficult with two people. It seems like she feels cramped in this thing and we'll have to get her a new one. When she was younger, she was less mobile and obviously, smaller. Still, I always wish every time bathtime comes around that I had gotten the one I had wanted and not this cheap piece of crap."
3,Menacing pad!,"Although the tub, itself worked fine, the yellow pad became unstuck. We threw it away after that, because the pad was a menace."
3,"Okay, but not the best","This tub is great in that in folds for storage and fits great when open in the kitchen sink. However, I found that when bathing my baby, water would 'back up' in this tub because there is only one drainage hole on the side of the tub. The water would back up in this tub because my baby's body would be in the way of the water flowing out, so I would have to lift my baby's body and tip the tub toward the drainage hole. More work in addition to trying to bathe a squirming infant. There should be two drainage holes, one on each side."
2,At least it folds up...,"If it didn't fold up, I wouldn't have any positive to say about it. Plus, our 4 month old is already too big for it. Even when he fit in it, it was so slippery that we needed two people to bathe him. Get a bigger tub, even if it takes up precious room in your house."
4,Works Great,"I personally like this tub. The only time it leaks is when it is too full and it leaks through the hinges. Yes, he looks a little uncomfortable because he is outgrowing it, but it works. It needs to be a little longer. He loves the water, so bathing him is easy. I never put the tub in the sink, I put it in our big tub, which works really well. I love the fact that it folds up, makes for easy storage. I also really like the cut out by the feet to hold shampoo and baby bath bottles."
1,* PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING *,"This item should be recalled. It broke the very first time I tried using it. I placed it over my sink and filled it with about 3"" of water before placing my 8 wk old baby in it. My baby only weighed 11 lbs 6 oz. Not even 30 seconds into his bath, the tub broke. It was the hinge on the right side of the foot end. The plastic broke. BUYER BEWARE!! The fold-up option is a great space saver, but the tub needs to be made with stronger materials."
3,CONVENIENT,"I bought this for my son who is now 5 and am buying it again for my new son. Not bulky, fits in kitchen sink, and can fold up and store under sink. great item"
4,Serves its purpose,This tub pretty much serves its purpose except that it's built in a way so that the baby is at a big incline. My baby is 6 weeks so it takes two of us to bathe him in this tub- one to wash him and one to hold him up. He wiggles around a lot in it. I like that it has a foam pad which makes it more comfortable.
2,Better options out there,I got this as a shower gift. The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub. She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again. I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption. I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here. I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone. Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year.....
2,Waste of Money!,I would not recommend this tub! I found that that the water level has to be very low to keep from sloshing over the sides. The inadequate amount of water allows the water temperature to become too cool before bath time is finished. I ended up purchasing a mesh seat that sits in your regular bath tub. I found it in the store(not available online). The name of it Mothers Touch by Summer. It is adjustable and dries quickly. I wish I would have bought this bath seat first!
2,A little small,"This tub worked wonderful when my son was smaller. He is only 10 weeks old (and 16 lbs.) and doesn't fit it anymore. I like the little tray thing at the end, it holds the shampoo and washcloth perfect. I never had any problems with the plug. However, if you get too much water in it it does leak where it folds up. It is a great tub, but only if you have a small baby."
4,Great tub!,"We are enjoying this tub, however, my daughter is getting a little big for it at 15 pounds. After each bath, I rinse it and turn it upside down on the sink to dry for a while. Then we fold it up and store it above the fridge. I am thinking about getting something else to use in our tub as she gets bigger, but for the price, it has really served its purpose for a bath in the sink."
5,excellent space saver,"This tub is awesome, and so affordable, I wish that I could say that about every baby product I have ever bought or received. I bathed my daughter in this up until she was about 3 months old, by that point, she had almost outgrown it (she's really long), and I had discovered that she really enjoys kicking her legs in the water and splashing, so I just stopped bathing her in it. Fortunately, my aunt is due in September, so I was able to pass it along to her to use. I really believe that the Saftey 1st products are great and an excellent value at extremely affordable prices."
2,I did not like this tub,"I did not like this tub. My baby did not look comfortable in it. As my baby grew it got worse. Though, I did like that it fit in the kitchen sink which made it easier to give my baby a bath."
1,THE WORST!!!,"I registered for this and I hated it so much! My son was born 20 inches long and he was all cruntched up. There are no suctions at the bottom so the tub would slide on me. Spend the extra money and get the EuroBath - Primo. I did, and it's the best."
2,Leaks and slips,"I used this tub for my second child. It leaked every time. We had to up towels all around it when we used it. It has no suction cups or anything to keep the tub itself on the counter. I found I could only wash her with one hand because the other hand had to be on the tub to make sure it didn't slip away! Plus, it was hard to wash her bum, and her legs from the knee down and feet were never in the water. (The ""pad"" isn't soft, just helps baby from slipping down.) It is light weight, and does fold, but for baby #3 (due in April 2002) we are shopping for a different tub!!"
2,Could be a little better,"We started using this tub when our baby turned 2 months. His body was too small for the tub. Since he would slide from side to side, we temporarily switched to a sponge tub. As he grew a little bigger, the tub worked out fine. Now that he is 6 months, he is too big for he tub. Half of his body is outside of the water. He is also at that age were he does not want to lay in a reclined position. And although the fold up feature is nice, the tub still remained out and about each night so that it may dry. Bottom line, I would shop around next time for a tub that we could utilize for a longer period of time."
1,Shivering Baby,"I received this tub as a gift and thought it was great until I used it. This tub doesn't hold enough water to keep your baby warm. My poor daughter sat shivering while I quickly tried to bathe her. At 2 1/2 months, she discovered how to bend her legs and push herself up, almost spilling out the top. Of course I had a grip on her and prevented that from happening.I have recently purchased a 4 in 1 tub and now my daughter loves it and she stays warm through out her bath time. I'm really enjoying bathing her, and being able to give her a nice, warm, long bath. I don't recommend this tub at all. It may be inexpensive, but you're better off purchasing a 4 in 1 or the Eurobath."
3,Decent for small babies,"This is the best hard infant bathtub we found. The ""no skid"" pad really does work and the fact that it folds up to store is nice. We have had problems with the drain plug leaking. It doesn't hold a lot of water so as baby gets bigger they seem to be colder. Finally, our son at four months has outgrown it. He is 16 pounds and 27 inches and just doesn't fit anymore."
2,SHOP AROUND FIRST,"Definately not what I thought it would be. The only benefit of this tub is that it folds up for storage. I found I had all the same problems as the other reviewers had. If you're going to buy a tub, spend the extra to get one that the baby can use for more than 4 weeks. This one may be inexpensive, but I now have to go purchase another tub and she's only 7 weeks old."
2,Too Small,"Though this tub worked wonders when my son was smaller, it is not too good anymore... and he is only 3 months old!! I did like the foam back and my baby loved his bath. Now that he is 24 inches long he is too long for this tub. We can't put much water in it because he is too heavey (15lbs). So he is cold and getting uncomfortable because of his length. So I would not recommend this tub."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This tub works fine. It does not pose any safty hazard and is better than just puting baby straight into the tub, but be aware that it does have some problems. Firstly, it is difficult to keep your baby (who cannot sit - which is the whole purpose of the tub) from drooping over to the side. It also brags that it is a space saver, but to me that is like a bicycle advertising itself as a space saver simply because the basket on the handle bars is removable...in other words it is an exaggeration. Lastly, after awhile, the bottom yellow pad starts peeling up and you can not get it to stick back down....I don't feel ripped off or anything, but I am having another baby now and replacing it with a better one. This one won't even make it to the garage sale...it is going in the trash."
3,Stores Easily...,"::Update::We started using this tub again, but the baby keeps getting his foot stuck underneath the end part which is an overhang of where the tub folds up. It's hurt him a few times. We're not going to use it anymore.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::I also received this as a gift and I was pretty excited because it folded up and stored really well. Unfortunately, that's pretty much where it stayed. My son didn't like it, he slipped down into the bootie part and it was too much work to try to hold him up and wash him. I couldn't let go of him or he would slip back down. I guess this product would've worked better if I had one of those spongy bath mat things to put in there. Do they even make those anymore?What we're doing now, is using the mesh bath seat that my mother bought and just sitting it in the floor of the bathtub. We use the detachable shower head and bathe him that way. He finds it very soothing. I was afraid that he was going to hate being bathed all together."
1,Too Hard!,"I was given this tub, and am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it is terrible. The plastic edges where the tub folds stick out and poke my little one in the temples when he slides sideways. He is always slipping down lower, and lower as I attempt to bathe him. The whole process quickly becomes an ordeal. I was a nanny all through college and never had these problems with the other tubs. I really don't like it."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this based on reviews from ""Baby Bargains"" planning to use it for my newborn and a toddler tub later on. I didn't like the slant of the seat. It was too difficult to bathe her before she was big enough to sit up. After reading some amazon reviews I ended up with the first years Sure Comfort deluxe newborn-to- toddler tub which I give 5 stars. It has a ""hammock"" for newborns which is absolutely the best idea. Since my girl was tiny we used it for about 4 or 5 mos. The seat rest for infants is more of an upright position so when she could almost sit by herself it was perfect. I look forward to continuing to use it into the toddler years - which means it's cost and space efficient - since I no longer need two tubs."
4,worked great for me,"I had no problems with this tub. My son is on the smaller side and we only used it until he was six months or so, but I didn't find that it leaked and it was compact and easily stored between bathtimes.I would recommend it."
2,"Fine for small babies, but not for long ones","We purchased this tub due to the fact that it was compact and stored easily, but my son outgrew this tub within weeks. He didn't sit in it very well and we were constantly afraid he would slip. It just didn't fit his body at all. Now with baby #2 on the way, I am shopping for a different tub, one that will snuggly hold the new baby's body better."
2,"Messy, Do not recommend","I registered for the tub because storage is limited in my house. My husband and I do not like this tub because if you fill it up too high the water spilled out of the sides where it folds up. It also does not hold very much water. Only my son's bottom is in the water. His feet and hands are out of the water, so he cannot explore the water with them. When he was younger his head always leaned to one side and ended up resting on the plastic side of the tub. I was always worried that he would slip down. I would recommend buying a different tub."
1,find a better tub...easy!,"I liked the easy storage, but its so uncomfortable. Baby's head is always slumped over to the side (on hard plastic), and she easily pushes herself up over the top. I use it in the bathtub with me, but the sides aren't sealed and the water gets in and makes the water in her tub too deep."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"This tub made bathtime horrible! Slip resitant pad my... arm! My baby slid all over the place. Now that he is 2 months he doesn't even fit in it anymore. 0-6 months, I don't think so! We bought another tub and were much happier, as is our son! Reading the other reviews I may try to use it as an after the bath seat. BEWARE every single complaint (in all the reviews) is well founded!!!!"
1,Highly uncomfortable,"We bought this tub since we have limited space, but it was so uncomfortable for our baby that is was a waste of money. When he was under 3 months, he would slip around despite the non-slip padding. Now he is 5 months and is too big almost, and he is not a ""big"" baby (about 14 lbs). Plus there is no room for any splashing around or toys. It's also difficult to wash his backside. If you fill it up too much water leaks out the sides where it hinges. Now I just get in the regular tub with him."
1,DONT BUY IT!,"I used this tub two times and it cracked while i had it in the sink and my 12 pound baby was in it. The part where the tub folds broke, i would not buy another fold up tub. They call this saftey first???"
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"We received this as a baby shower gift (after registering for it). I had hoped it would work in our kitchen sink and then fold up to store easily in our small house. However, it doesn't fit well in the sink -- either the sink is too small or too deep as it would leave the tub hanging only by the fold-up sides. And, like another reviewer said, it leaks and doesn't hold much water.While I fully understand that babies and children tend to make a mess, a slippery floor and a slippery baby aren't what I'd prefer to have at the same time.It also doesn't quite seem big enough. My son is only 8 weeks old and there's already not enough room for his legs and feet. (Granted, he was 9lbs 3oz to begin with and just keeps growing.)I think I'll be buying a bigger, bulkier tub soon - as he's still too young for me to feel comfortable bathing him in the sink and my back and knees can't take putting this tub in the bathtub."
4,Nice compact tub,"This tub has proven very handy. My son got his first bath in it at only 3 days old. I admit, that was a little tricky. However, in no time we had it down and I was able to bathe him easily anywhere. Usually we take the bath on his bedroom floor. I like the portability and the fact that it can fold up and fit under the bathroom counter, since his bathroom is also the guest bathroom. I also like the little section in the front. That's where I put the soapy water. It's easy to rinse him off with a little watering can. The tub has been great, but now that my son is 17 lbs. it's getting small. I will be looking for another bath aid soon, but I'll miss this handy tub."
1,UNSAFE - SAFETY HAZARD,"I received this tub as a shower gift. My son is 7 weeks old and weighs a little over 10lbs. Last night while bathing him the locking mechanism broke, collapsed in and if it was not for me holding him with one hand he would have gone under the water. I am returning this today and contacting the manufacturer to file a formal complaint because I see other reviews with the same complaint leading me to believe that this tub is a safety hazard and should be recalled. Besides that being my biggest problem with it I also did not like that the water does not cover the babys body more, it was hard to give him an easy transition into the water without giving him a chill. DO NOT BUY THIS TUB!!"
1,no 0 stars - tragedy waiting to happen,"this collapsed while the baby was in it! i contacted saftey first - they were rude and unsymphatetic - they said no other complaints were logged - read through the rewiews from other parents - you will find that many say the hinges broke while the baby was in the tub - this can couse a SEVERE INJURY TO YOUR CHILD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I bought an inflatable tub and i have been so happy with it! PLEASE, PLEASE do not buy this tub for your baby - its made poorley and someone is going to really get hurt while using it"
1,TOE Catcher,"I have to say that at first this was a great tub bc i had such a small house, well, I was wrong. Yes, it takes up less space but my son doesn't like it. He squirms and slips all over. And worse of all, his toes get stuck in the hinges. Once was enough for me and him, I couldn't take the tears. Definitly don't buy this, go for the tub pillow."
4,It's all you really need.,"I used this tub with my first son and will use again with my second. It's basically all you need for the first several months. Great for the countertop and storage is a breeze with the fold up feature. If you're not looking for anything fancy or expensive, this product should suit."
1,Cramps long babies!,"I don't recommend this tub for babies over 22 inches long. My daughter was that long at birth & when I began bathing her a few weeks later, I kept noticing that her feet would get stuck under the edges of where the bottom part folds up! The edges are rough, so it could possibly scrape the tops of baby's feet. I just didn't want her to get her little toes stuck, so I was constantly worrying about her feet instead of enjoying her bath experience! Only plus about this tub is the fact that it does fold up for storage."
1,Poor choice for newborn,"I heard that bath time was supposed to be enjoyable for newborns, a time to bond and have fun. This tub has definitely interfered with having a quality bath time experience! Perhaps it is better for older children, but my newborn slides all over the place. She has to be physically held in place to keep from falling over, making it very difficult to bathe her alone. The design provides little stability. She frequently wedges her feet and hands under the connecting parts. She screams the entire time. On occasion, I've been fearful that her feet or hands were pinched in the folding mechanism (thankfully, they weren't). The water level is low, so she freezes the entire time. The fact that it can be folded-up is a good feature ... however, that may be all it is good for ... being stored. I'm looking for another tub ..."
4,nice for annotation,"I liked this product well enough after the 30 day trial to buy it. Main feature for me is the ability to annotate PDFs using a tablet PC. Very nice for copyediting, much faster than dragging/typing on virtual sticky notes. The interface is customizable so you can have it be terse and ""confusing"" or simple and menu-driven.The price is high, but it's justified if your work involves a lot of copyediting."
3,Great for the beginner!,"Another in the VQSG series from Peach Pit Press, this book is a good general reference, but NOT the kind of thing that you cuddle up with in front of the fireplace. It serves best as a ""how-do-I-do-this?"" kind of book. At well over 600 pages, there aren't too many questions that you could have about Panther that aren't answered by this book. It limits itself to an audience of basic to intermediate users, but I really think that even advanced users would have questions that could be answered in here.Now, having said all that, as someone who considers himself an advanced user, I'll admit to you that I haven't used this book that much myself. I think I read through the section on Applescript once and referenced the UNIX Basics a couple of times. It's not that it's bad, quite the contrary, but it would probably serve someone else a little better than me."
5,Funny and respectful to the most part :-),"My favorite line ""I might I have joined the Navy"".A collection of movies that incorporates eclectic themes with caricature of every-day events bound to bring laughs at each viewing by including :- Daring manoeuvers- Intertitles filled with wit- Great music"
5,DVD quality,"You're here so I know you are aware how wonderful Harold Lloyd is, so I'll skip the part where I tell you this is one of the best filmmakers to ever live... and get to the part you may wonder about - the video quality.I've viewed probably half the collection so far and the image quality is wonderful. Not the best silent film quality I've ever seen, but definately a B+ at least.The music is great as well. This isn't the Brownlow & Gill restoration of The General with the full BBC treatment, but again it is very good. Another B+ in my opinion.So with that kind of DVD quality you have no reason to wait - go get it now - and get several for your friends too. This is the perfect Harold Lloyd collection I've been waiting for for twenty years!"
4,"REDISCOVER A FABULOUS, DARING PHYSICAL COMIC IN 27 FILMS","The three volume, seven disc HAROLD LLOYD COMEDY COLLECTION showcases this lesser-known comic genius in 27 films: talkies, silents, shorts and features that hold up amazingly well.Among the peripheral delights of this new to DVD set are the numerous views of Los Angeles and environs in the 1920s.A huge box office star in the 20s, Lloyd made over 200 films. He first appeared on screen in, but it took him another 70 screen appearances before he latched onto the iconic horn rim glasses prop and the ""everyman"" persona for which he is best known. ""Safety Last,"" ""The Freshman"" and ""Speedy!"" are worth the price alone.Tons of extras, vintage material, bios and commentaries make this a real deal.Not Rated. Genre: Vintage Comedy. 24 Hours (not including 3 hours of extras). Starring: Harold Lloyd. Directors: Various."
5,A Legacy on 7 DVDs,I wasn't the biggest Harold Lloyd fan growing up. You didn't see much of him outside of the hanging off the clock. But I picked up this set after seeing the trolley/turkey scene from Hot Water. And I'm so happy. I've only made it through a few of the 14 features and 14 shorts on these sets. The bonus DVD in the boxset gives a great sense of what Lloyd the man was like. His Christmas tree is amazing. And the views of Green Acres let us know that this was not a man who was ripped off by the studio system. Also the man knew how to keep his Oscar winning speech short.If you have already bought the Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton DVD sets - you will be blown away by this collection. Suzanne Lloyd has done her Grandfather proud with this project.
2,Great History but a major disappointment regarding images,"I purchased this book to gain color references for the mosaics.....unfortunately, the majority of this book contains black and white plates. If you are planning on using this book as a reference for color, forget it."
1,Keeps dying on me,"I bought this amp to power a 12 inch MTX 7500 speaker about 6 months ago. I am now going on to my 3rd one. After 2 months the amplifier simply stops working, I take it back to the stereo shop, and they replace it with another TC6001, and within 2 months I am back getting another one. I recommend avoiding this amplifier at all cost, unless you are a person who likes spending money on things that are not up to par."
1,No more respect for MTX,"MTX must be putting more emphasis on quantity over quality. After only 6 months the TC6001 stopped working. I took it to the local stereo shop and they told me it's putting out straight DC voltage to my subwoofer. Unfortunately it fried my subwoofer. Now, not only will I have to get a new amp I will have to get a new sub too. Thanks a lot MTX."
3,ACCOMPLISHED BUT DISAPPOINTING,"Khaled's latest Cd is designed to mainstream rai with generous dollops of western pop-friendly sensibilities. Unfortunately, ""Kenza"" lacks depth; missing are many of the mournful middle-eastern inflections that made the Don Was produced ""Khaled"" more substantial and emotive. At times, ""Kenza"" threatens to delve into darker, more brooding areas but throughout ""Kenza"" it's usually the sunny, frothy upbeat melodies that wash over everything else and flatten out affect. Lost is the grit of a music which originated in the slums of Algeria as a voice for the voiceless."
4,Organization of a modern laboratory,"The book is very well written and concise manual for organizing and outfitting a smaller laboratory. The chapters on Organization, quality management and safety are applicable not only to laboratories in ""tropical countries"", but are general for all laboratories. I found the book useful for as inspiration to prepare teaching material. Looking forward to reading ""Part 2"""
4,Another Azymuth gem,"It's great to see (and hear)Azymuth bringing out some refreshing releases of late. It's difficult to label their music as it's so diversified in its mix of genres. I think this makes them more appealing to wider audiences. One of my favourite tracks Papa (written by bassist Malheiros) features his daughter on vocals and is so smooth and classy. Overall I would rate Woodland Warrior slightly ahead of this release but only by a fraction, they are both great listening and should appeal to Smooth Jazz lovers who like a bit more bite to their music."
3,I've seen better.,"For the price it is OK. It reminds me of the videos that teach you how to pinstipe and paint flames. They make it look so easy when it isn't. For a much better, albeit more expensive and a bit more difficult to locate, get the FAQ Frequently Asked Questions about painting figure techniques by the Andrea Miniatures Team published by Andrea Press."
4,Giant print NIV bible,Great Bible for those of us with diminishing eyesight. Affordable compared to in store prices. Shipping much quicker than indicated.
4,By new NIV Bible,"I was worry earlier becuase it took longer that I was expecting the bible to arrive. However, I was overjoyed when I received it and immediately opened the neatly wraped package. It surely had what I was looking for. The font size are giant size and easy to read and understand. I will absolutely recommend it for anyone looking for a giant size, easy to read and understand, with references leather bound back bible.O. Boateng"
4,"Good, useful material.","I have been a professional psychic for 17 years, and I read many of the books published on the subject of psychic abilities. I found this book to be very understable, with easy exercises to open up one's own psychic abilities. Contrary to what another reviewer has had to say, I do not feel that there is anything in this book which could be considered ""harmful"" or ""dangerous."" This book and its techniques are based on ancient wisdom and will work for you if you follow the simple instructions/exercises with consistency and practice. --Rev. Jeff, www.revjeff.com"
3,THis is just OK,"I expected more from this book. It tries to claim too much for which the book would have to be a 1000 pages! Instead it is the exact opposite, it is just a few techniques from ancient egypt and some techniques from other cultures. This book is just the tip of the iceberg. Sort of like a weak version of cliff's notes.Each chapter in this book could be a book by itself, and by that I mean the material presented here is very shallow. It tries to take a 4000 year old system and condense it to 20 pages while losing the real meaning along the way. This is a very good book for beginners. Think of this book as a sort of glossary you can use for future research in a real book. Although I have throughly based this book, you should buy it. It is well worth the price for $10. Frankly, there is stuff in here I had no clue about. I'm just disappointed at the books shallowness. Buy it!"
5,Metaphysical teaching at its finest!,"I have purchased multiple copies of this book to pass on to those that seem to show up in my life seeking to further their path towards enlightenment. It is such a simple, yet well written, book and teaching tool. It is also a great teaching tool for anyone new to or interested in learning about many facets of spirituality."
3,Informative but a little strange. . .,"Now I'm as open minded as the next person, and this book had some really good information in it about chakras and auras and things like that, but I had two problems with this book. One, the exercises that it mentions are all the SAME! Whatever you are working on- auras, chakras, channeling, etc- you sit there infront of a mirror with a candle. Are there no other ways to meet your spirit guides or study your aura? Secondly, every chapter would start off with a quote. That in and of itself was okay, but several of the chapters began with the author quoting himself, with no references to previous writings or anything, so for all we know it could be something he said on the bus to some guy! I thought that was both pompous and eccentric. So my advice to you is to look for something else. This book has information in it that can likley be found in a more informative and reader-friendly style."
2,Amazing,I am amazed that one would rate this 5 stars-Before I became learned I was a devout christian-This fellow says someone visited christ after the cross in a past life after his twin was put on the cross.Incredible. I rate this two stars for the teachings of the Chakra systems.
5,Cutest stationary ever!,"I sent a pack to my best friend who loves writing letters, and she adored the little dragons. She sent me a couple letters with the stationary and I thought it made the dragons made the letters extra special :)"
2,What happened?,"I think Defari's debut album (Focused Daily) is one of the most underrated hip-hop records of the past few years, so I had very high expectations for this CD, which made it all the more disappointing when I heard how mediocre it was. Defari himself isn't the problem, he's still a great MC, but the production on this album is awful; it's full of bland, boring, in-one-ear-and-out-the-other beats. Even the worst tracks on Focused Daily are better than anything here...and as for Evidence and Babu, I sure hope they're saving their good beats for the next Dilated album, because their work here isn't anywhere near their usual high standards. A major disappointment...save your money and buy Focused Daily instead."
5,ALBUM OF THE YEAR,Wow this album is amazing. This is defanilty Defari's best work. The production is dope. This is defanitly 5 mic album. Every single track is dope! Please go out and pick this up if you havn't already.
5,A new Mike Martt,This is a wonderful new style for Mike Martt. Good lyrics and compositions. Worth owning this CD!
4,Helps to fill the Couglin Void,"This is a well written book. It is not as good as the previous Coughlin's; however, the story is engaging and exciting. Added the Kindle edition to my collection so that I can have in both in paperback and electronic versions since his works are so hard to find now."
5,Excellent,"I enjoyed this book, it was funny, the mystery was good and it kept you guessing to the end. I would definitely read this author again."
1,A Remake,This is just a rip of JUDY AND LIZA AT THE LONDON PALLEDIUM.Buy the original concert it's a lot more value for money.
3,Judy - Liza - a great combination!,"While this album does not in any way compare to Judy's infamous 1961 Carnegie Hall recording, it does have some merits of its own - Judy's ""What Now My Love"" and Liza's ""The Travelin' Life"" are but two highlights on this abridged version of the 2-disc set originally released in 1965, which itself was only an abridged recording of the complete concert. It is definitely worth a listen, even though Judy sounds a bit ragged, especially towards the end, because of the dynamics of the two legendary performers working together. If ONLY Capitol Records would release the complete concert on CD! Not Judy's best performance, but there are still some pleasures to be heard and savored."
2,Judy/Liza Together Concert,"Owning the original released double album of this concert, I was dissappointed that Capitol Records did not release the entire concert on this CD. Many of Liza's and Judy's finest moments are missing from this collection. It would be great if Capitol released the entire concert as it did with Judy in Carnegie Hall. Now, THAT, was truly expectacular."
3,It's OK,"Since we're actually living here, I thought my husband and I could learn more facts about this magnificent city. It's about average really."
5,Kut u up's album definatly a step on the right foot,"look at this album, it is good. i listen to it all and it is good. it makes me want white rice instead of fried rice. that is all."
4,A Very Underrated CD!!!,"I bought this cd only because I wanted to have all five of Tim McGraw's cd's. I had never heard any of the songs before, and only one song on this album even cracked the top 50. So I pretty expected this album to collect a lot of dust on my cd rack while I enjoyed his other 4 cd's. But once I heard all of the songs on this album, I was amazed!!! There are some damn good songs on here!!! There is only 1 song I skip over (the only Tim McGraw song I don't care for) but the rest are extremely easy-listening and enjoyable and this cd is unmistakeably pure country! I only gave this cd 4 stars since it lacks that one breakthrough hit, and it isn't quite as great as his 4 other 5-star blockbuster albums. But compared to a lot of the crap in today's country music world, (i.e. Shania Twain), this is one underdog that came through big! Really, a must for any true Tim McGraw or real country fan!!!"
5,Real Country Music,"This is Tim McGraw's best CD.I would rather listen to this disc over any of the newer stuff that he put out,and still puts out.This is how country music is supposed to sound.Not all bubble gum pop,like the ""country"" music of today sounds like.If you're a fan of REAL country music...pick this CD up.You'll be glad you did."
3,This shows Tim McGraw's true potential,When Tim McGraw first came on the music scene everyone kept saying he could not sing and would never make it. I think this CD shows that he had potential and there would be greater things to come from Tim. He is now a superstar with many #1 songs. He will definitely be around for a long time to come.
5,out of this world,"the man is so talented,his voice just goes threw your body.when i listen to him for the first time and to the words of his songs i felt overwelmed."
3,Decent Speakers,"They were a pretty good value for the price.Pros: Price, Size, ClearityCons: Not Very loud without distorting, Case is pretty fragile.Overall if you are looking for great surround speakers dont buy these, but if you want to use as a small stereo system (as i did) for the price you will be happy with them"
4,Great for the price,"They give the sound that two ways generally give (typical lack in well defined mid range ). They are great for people who like to rock out or just need a good solid pair of speakers and don't care much for high quality. What really impressed me was how vary strong, clear, and tight the bass was after positioning a little fiber glass insulation all around the insides. The bass can almost punch you in the face if your not careful! I would not recommend them for stand alone Tv applications as they are just not quite right for it (good if used with the tv's or small high range woffers). If you own an equalizer you might be able to tune out some of the low, the high and bring up some of the mid range for tv applications."
1,Shockingly poor,"Awful book. It looks like a really bad draft of an expanded MA dissertation. Spelling mistakes that would make a 15 year old cringe page after page, a very narrow and skewed view of history. The author insisted that the book was fact-driven; rather, it was driven by skewed interpretations of selective facts. This book really gives proper academia a bad name. Awful."
1,The Rise and Fall of the Holy Roman Empire from Charlemagne to Napoleon,"This book uses the thin veneer of historical interpretation to allow the author to deliver his true message of his book, an assault on the Catholic faith and it's institutions. If found in a library, don't waste your time. If you are planning to buy, save your money."
2,Doesn't measure up to the first 3 seasons,I have the first 3 seasons and felt this is a low grade imitation. Even the episodes with Chang's son were better but the DVD isn't out yet.
1,wrong stuff,The poster of this movie is Kung Fu Killer 2 not Kung Fu Killer 1. It made buy wrong stuff.
3,"The new ""Kung Fu"" movie is worth of your $$$",This new Carrantine movie is Not as good as the original kung fu series (1972) which run for 3 seasons and spawned a movie sequel kung fu // the movie (1986) and a sequel series called kung fu // the legend continues (1993) BUT it deserves your attention u movie lovers of carrantine's martial arts movies.Carrantine looks old in this movie but still a great fighter who this time battles an evil general who wants to control the country by force.An OK movie who deserves your $$$ but be carefull. There is also a sequel called kung fu killer II which is a total waste of time even with Carrantine in it. So avoid that and get this movie which witnessed the return of the kung fu master DAVID CARRANTINE in to the role we all loved him in the past. KUNG FU KILLER...
3,Dull,I bought this because a lot of the reviews for the different sizes said it was sharp. The one I got was really dull. I'll have to work on it with a grinder before using a stone to get an edge. I only gave it 3 stars because it's made in the USA otherwise it would have been 2 stars.
1,Awful Generic Case!!!,"Do not spend your hard earned money on this case!! The packaging and look/feel is brutal--provides very little protection. It looks like something that you can pick up at the flea market for half the price. The worst part is that the seller does not offer any refunds. I contacted amazon.com about this, but I've yet to hear back from them. Overall, a very bad experience--both with the seller and amazon.com."
5,Bullets Over Summer DVD Review,"Excellent Hong Kong movie in the same vein of such other popular titles as ""The Mission"" and ""Beast Cops."" The attention-grabbing intro in which two undercover cops break up a liquor store hold-up draws the viewer in and keeps them riveted throughout the fast-paced film, which utilizes an edgy cinematography and good character development. Two undercover cops stake out an apartment to catch a criminal across the street and along the way one of them falls in love with a pretty young woman and the other befriends a pregnant woman working at a dry cleaner's. Lots of gunfire and graphic action sequences. Highly recommended!"
5,my 2 year old loves it!!!,"Got this book originally from the library and am now purchasing it because my daughter needs to hear it every night! She loves the pictures of all the different children doing fun things. There are fun rhymes too. There are sections called little childrens likes and loves, what little children don't like etc.. my 5 year old likes this too and it can be a good way to talk about feelings with older kids. So much going on in a compact little book. Everytime we read it my daughter seems to make new discoveries about things on the pages."
2,I can't believe I watched the whole thing.,"Flint the Time Detective is behind its time. The writers tried to give the characters a sense of humor but in doing so used the same gags and punchlines that everyone has come to identify and find as the epitamy of not funny. I could forgive the film for its lack of thinking and character development if I could classified it as a very young children's movie; however, the way the main villainess was drawn with her luscious curves would leave me no choice but to forbid my children from seeing it. All around, a horrible movie"
2,Muddying clear waters,"""Psycho-babble"" exactly! In this book Renate Craine claims to be trying to make the ""difficult"" writings of Hildegard more clear to the modern reader. The snippets of Hildegard's own writings that we get in this book are like little islands of clarity in the mass of Craine's new age ramblings. I wonder who exactly Craine thinks she's writing for.I believe that Craine is a sincere Christian and I have gleaned some tidbits of value from her. But this is a frustrating book. I am down to the final 2 chapters and I will grit my teeth and attempt to finish this thing.And then I will look for something of pure Hildegard on her own to reward myself. She seems to have been an incredible person and an instrument through whom Christ speaks to the world."
5,A Must Have,"These talented new musicians will make your world a better place! Their lyrics are original and heartfelt and their reggae, rock, jammin' style will have you dancing and singing along. Truly a unique and refreshing listen as they skillfully change tempo and tonality with flair."
4,Good overall prep tool-but not a stand alone,"Today I took the 2000 AP Euro History Test. After a quick review in class, I used the Barron's book for about 1 week to review and prepare. The book does a great job with the earlier stuff like Renaissance material, but slides off near the end. Most of the review is political history, which was great for the 2000 exam. I would definitely recommend this book for any AP student, as it is invaluable for late preparations, and does a good job with the overall review, although the multiple choice questions were more difficult than those on the real AP test. That may be a positive aspect though, as it prepares you for the most difficult examination possible."
3,Use to get the basics,"This prep is good for reviewing and learning basic info near May. It doesn't cover social history whatsoever, which was a disaster for the 1999 AP Euro Exam, in which half the questions from the multiple choice and one essay group were social history. Don't rely on this book, but rather use to review along side notes/textbooks if you haven't before the test date. The practice questions adn essays were way too easy."
4,Brief and concise.,"The test-taking tips are kept to a minimum, unlike PR. The review is concise and accurate, though it leaves out social history and information about the ideologies. The test questions are more realistic than in other books. This book is not comprehensive enough to stand as a single source."
5,FANTASTIC!,"This book is wonderful. The summaries of the different periods in European history are EXTREMELY HELPFUL. I did all my homework during the year, but found that I could not remember a lot of things and got many events mixed up. Read the summaries CAREFULLY. STUDY this book and you'll do fine. I got a 5. I'm not a fan of some of these Barrons AP prep books (the AP US History book is terrible), but this one is definitely worth your money. The size of this book is not intimidating at all. Anyone will be able to handle this!"
1,Not Big-Picture Clear Enough,"I felt that this book, sadly yes, did not have enough material in it to get me through the AP Exam. I never saw the big picture before, and I still do not. I still do not understand communism- who is stalin again? and hitler? my my, it just keeps escaping me. Gee Golly Oh Whiz, i just bombed the AP Exam, because this book was the one that i relied mostly upon, and it failed me in the end. .... I just do NOT see the big picture. and again- who is leonardo da vinci? but i digress. what can i say? the whole exam was about the 20th century basically and social history. so where does that leave US people who studied THIS BOOK?! IT LEAVES US IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE~"
3,A Romantic album,"I owned this album almost 30 years ago, and it was great to hear all of my favorites again today on CD. ""The Way you Look Tonight"" and ""When I Fall In Love"" are my favorites and are such soothing and enjoyable songs."
2,One of the most annoying in the series,"My three year old loves all of this series, but for parents, a warning: this is a particularly annoying entry. I find Petrie's blind devotion to his uncle grating and his uncle Ptynaro (or however you spell it) extremely tiring. If you've got to get a couple of tapes from the series to entertain the little one, pass on this one!"
2,Creative,Not so bad as I hoped after my little gbrother begged and pleaded for this one. I watched it and most people say that there is like singing every 5 seconds. They are just exaggerating. Itwas a very creative movie with a sort of Boy who cried Wolf sense in it.
1,Please stop making horrible sequils!,"The original LBT was the ONLY good one. That awful habbit of singing every 5 min has GOT to go! & 3D animation may be ""new"" & ""in"" but it looks like ""crap"" mixed with cell. Much like Disney, Universal Studious is more interested in spewing out animation of poor quality in a rush for profits. They've lost their integrity of quality entertainment. Plus it's torture having to watch it if you're over 13."
2,"Kids will watch it, but is that good?","For parents:Compared to the other ""Land Before Time"" movies (we haven't seen the newest one), this is the worst. The production values are good for a direct to video release, but the content is shallow. The uncle pterosaur is just mean and his later redemption is lame. As usual, the dino kids' impulses put them in danger. Very very predictable with nothing whatsoever for the parents. Makes a good babysitter, at least for the first viewing.For kids:It's another ""Land Before Time"", so if you haven't seen it then what else matters? Warning: there are singing dinosaurs, but you can fast forward those parts."
5,Aliens visit the Great Valley,"My Daughter loves the Land Before Time series and we now have all 13 Movies. The Stone of Cold Fire is #7 in the series. Its not one of my favorites, but my 6 year old daughter thought it was great and has watched it multiple times since we received it 1 month ago. This movie includes 2 new characters visiting from ""beyond the mysterious beyond"" space. If your family loves land before time characters like ours does you must include this movie in your library."
4,very timely,I ordered this for my 12 year old son and wasn't too sure what the quality of it would be.Well it was in excellent condition and arrived quickly.I have nothing but cudo's for the seller.
2,never came,A good children s movie that in my youth opened me to philosophy but my DVD never came to me.
3,PERFECT GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER,"While I loved the doll and Elmo - as did my granddaughter, when the doll arrived, the batteries in the Elmo were all corroded. I had to buy new batteries and clean the battery container before the Elmo would work. Kind of sad that it didn't come ""gift"" ready and so i am glad i had it shipped directly to me and not my granddaughter."
5,Barbie Loves T.M.X Elmo Doll and so does Granddaugher,"Barbie Loves T.M.X. Elmo Doll is every bit as great as the picture showed it to be. Barbies' Shirt, Socks and bag are all Elmo. Very cute! Shipped very quickly too. Great gift. Great Vendor, Great Service"
4,happy elmo,"my little child enjoy barbie loves TMX elmo doll, it was a great gift for her, i do recommend 85%"
1,Cross-Marketing...,"I haven't seen this clever cross-marketing in a long time. Well, maybe not since ""Barbie races Nascar"" or whatever. The nice part about this is, you get the illusion of two toys in one; of course, the rich kids are really going to want the TMX Elmo doll to go along with it. But, the poor kids will get stuck with marked-down 'Bratz' anyway - but they like that crap... Just like they would love this crap, if you could fit it into your budget."
4,Excellent Historical Writing,"Good story with a well-crafted plot which I found more impacting as a representative of the historical genre than as a preternatural tale. The author has an uncanny ability to recreate a previous era in a multi-faceted way that truly brings the past into the present. I've never read other volumes in this series but can attest to the fact that this one, set in the so-called ""Dark Ages"" during a time of Viking incursions into feudal Europe, was an enjoyable, cerebral read."
2,What you pay is what you get,"Everything they teach my 12 year old already knows. I think it has some good info for younger kids but not for middle school children. I do not recommend this product, not worth it."
5,Probably and excellent book.,"I always enjoy her books, so this one is probably one I will like too. I have not read it, but I am tired of being hassled by Amazon to review it, so perhaps this is stop that. You know, in a book store, I get it, I pay for it, and I leave. End of transaction. Not so here. And If you rate it, you must write at least 20 words of commentary. Truly annoying sometimes."
2,Don't expect to learn much Hebrew,It is basically the same as Pimsleur's Conversational Hebrew so I did not need to buy both! So I need to request a refund on one when I return from Israel. The tapes spend too much time on just a few conversations.
5,Great way to learn conversational Hebrew,I study Hebrew in an Ulpan class and use these Cd's in the car. They are well done. It is easy to understand the speakers pronounciation and the format progresses in a logical way with frequent review of older material. There are no grammer drills - just lots of conversation with explanations. These are perfect for someone who wants to learn to have conversations but if you want to add reading and grammer skills then you need another resource as well.
2,Looks like more in the picture,"These are cute but very small. They look like a lot more in the picture, but are actually very small."
1,Not Happy!,"I recently had some bad experiences with Sperry, Rockports, etc. All of them were made in China of course. Soooo I decided to stick with a shoe made in the good ole USA.I got on Sebago's website and they were all about their shoes being made in the USA, old yankee craftsmanship, etc.. I ordered my Scoodics, received them promptly at what I felt was a reasonable price, and discovered they are made in the Dominican Republic. I havent worn them yet but they look kind of crappy, and I'm alreday mad about the overseas manufacture issue. This country is going down the tubes fast if we cant even build a damn pair of shoes anymore."
3,Sebago Men's Schoodic,"The Sebago shoes which I purchased for my husband arrived in a timely manner. They are very well made and look good. However, the sizing runs small. I ordered size 10 1/2 wide and they were too tight, therefore I returned them and received a credit on my charge card. I had also ordered a pair of Dunham boat shoes in the same size (10 1/2 wide) which fit beautifully. Both shoes are of very good quality."
1,Too narrow,"I wound up returning these wide shoes, since they were too narrow to even fit on my feet. For shoes that are labeled ""wide"", this is clearly misleading. Of course, Amazon took this back without question - but whacked me for postage since the wrong order was ""my fault."" Clearly, the manufacturer's design, which differs from industry standards, is my fault... Be forewarned, if you have wide feet."
4,Not too shabby,"This is my second smokeless ashtray. For the person who thought it makes too much noise, you should have heard the ""As Seen On TV"" smokeless ashtray I used to have. That thing would wake up the neighborhood even if it had a Midas muffler installed, so by comparison this one is quiet.All I can say is this unit does a decent job at what it's supposed to do. If you live in an apartment and don't want to disturb the neighbors with extra smoke creeping out your door as you listen to, oh, I don't know, say the ""Legend"" album by Bob Marley, this one's for you. As for the smoke you exhale, there's still nothing on the market for that yet except a good old fashioned window but this smokeless ashtray sure keeps the smoke to a minimum. Now excuse me while I put 'Jamming' on again and raid the fridge."
1,stinks,"This is the worst thing I ever bought, not only is it noisy it does not keep the smoke in. Awful piece of garbage."
3,smokeless,I don't know why I BUY THIS ITEM. It starts making noise after one day! I guess I'll have to find another brand.
3,It works but it's too loud,It worked well enough but the noise was unacceptable. For a noisy environment like a bar it would be fine. Also doesn't hold your cig well when butts fill up
3,Disappointed Smoker,I wanted this smokeless ashtray because I don't smoke in the house but now that the cold weather is here it makes it impossible to go outside or even to the garage to smoke. It sort of works if you keep your cigarette inside or at the edge when not at your lips. I was hoping it would be a little more powerful.
2,Arrived damaged,"Dome, top part of the device arrived broken in two pieces. Called company twice, didn't talk to anybody and didn't have time to call again so gave up on that."
1,smokeless ashtray,"It does very little to help eliminate smoke. As long as you cigerette is resting in the ashtray, it absorbs the smoke. But remove the cigerette even a small distance, and it does nothing. Pretty expensive for what it does."
3,All Stars is not really ALL STAR,"This game on XBOX is good but could have been much better!!PROS: Graphics is excellent, Life like faces of the MLB players.CONS: The game play is not good. No Zoom Angles.Instead of all extra featuures ASB should have focus on the game play. You will probably get bored with this game after a couple of hours."
1,worst baseball game i ever played!!,"this game is the worst when you go up to bat when the pitcher pitches the ball you dont see the ball icon so you could move your position and when you try to swing you have to hold down ""A""instead of just tapping it because if you tap it you will do a check swing. The controls are weird. I perfer triple play 2002 its way better than this game. It has easier feilding better ways to hit and graphics are really good."
4,If you love to play baseball......then this is good choice,"What can I say....I'm not a hardcore gamer. I played baseball through the end of high school and trust me...ASB 2003 is a good solid game. The graphics are good, the game play keeps it interesting, and it has Ichiro. A lot of so-called 'hardcore' gamers like to find flaws with anything they can. ASB 2003 will keep you interested long after the MLB 2002 season is over. There are drawbacks....the controls take a great deal of time to learn and can be overwhelming at times. I got use to it though and it made the game that much more of a challenge. I enourage you to pick it up....or atleast rent it. Its a good game."
2,world series baseball is better,I just writing to tell you not to waste your money on all star baseball 2003 because the game is boring. World Series Baseball is better on xbox.
2,Buy World Series 2003 Not This,"While certainly not as horrible as Triple Play Baseball, this game has two negatives which in my mind are so vital to a good baseball game that they destroy any chances this has of being one.1. Starting pitchers tire after 4 or 5 innings. Not even Curt Schilling or Randy Johnson stand a chance of getting a CG.2. Each game takes 1hr 15min to 2 hrs to complete.I returned this game in exchange for World Series 2003 and am much happier for that decision."
2,Nice try,"Decent graphics with sometimes jaw-dropping thought to detail (e.g., pitchers wearing jackets on basepaths, broken bats, etc.). That said, game is too damn hard to win. I'm very good at baseball games, and I haven't beaten the CPU in about 25 games. I'm frustrated as hell with it. Not that I need the ease of Triple Play to boost the ole' ego, but come on!!I'm looking forward to checking out World Series baseball, I'll leave it at that."
4,Great Game!!,"This is by far the best baseball game I have ever played.You wont find yourself hitting tons of homers in every game like Triple Play, its much more realistic. The game doesnt keep track of as many stats as High Heat, but has just about every one I pay attention to. If you are just looking for an a game with great graphics I suggest World Series Baseball, but if you are looking for great gameplay this is the game for you."
1,Sorry Acclaim Fans...,"I am a baseball fan, like most of you who are reading this, and couldn't wait to get a great baseball game for the XBOX this season. I must trash this game a bit though, cuz simply it's not the best hardball game on the system, in my opinion of course. I think World Series Baseball from sega sports is tops this year. ASB is better than Triple Play however, cuz ""mighty"" EA sports have really lost it. If you're looking for the best and most fun though, please check out World Series Baseball. Rock on!"
3,3 and 3/4 stars...,"This game is pretty good. The MAIN problem with it is the Batting style of the game. It is too hard to hit the ball, but you can put it on easy batting in the options in the middle of the game. I think the outfield plays could have been more simple to do but not too bad. This game is worth buying if you lik baseball/baseball games. But if you are not sure you should rent or play it at a friends house first. This game is actually better than the other game Triple Play. I don't know about World Series though I suggest trying that first also before buying any baseball games, except MLB Slugfest which is a different BLITZ-STYLE type of baseball game where you can hit people."
2,Uninspired and unimpressed,"I had high hopes that Acclaim would return to the exciting gameplay that it had captured in it's All Star Baseball for the N64. This game is for the XBox right? It should awe you with color and quickness..however this game is unfortunately slow, bland and unexciting. Rent it first, chances are you will be as unimpressed as I was."
3,Overall,"Pitching is not very good, starting pitchers usually last no more than 5 innings, relief only goes 1 sometimes two innings. batting is excellent."
2,Triple Play Baseball is much better,"I purchased All star Baseball 2003 and thought the graphics were really outstanding. It is probably the best in depth baseball game ever made. However, the game play itself is not user friendly. The batting cursor is very difficult to maneuver. You only have a fraction of a second to line the cursor up so you have a chance to hit the ball. This ruins the game for me. I took it back and exchanged it for triple play baseball. Now triple play is not as in depth but it has pretty good graphics too and the gameplay itself is much much much more user friendly.Some reviews for triple play say that it is to easy to hit home runs and I would have to agree that it is but all you have to do is increase the level of difficulty to all star. On all star you would be lucky to hit more then one or two home runs per 9 inning game. All star baseball is a fascinating game but if you just want to play ball then Triple Play is the game to get."
1,impossible b.s. game,"This game absolutely [stinks]. I would recommend that this game never be purchased by anyone looking for a good baseball game. I am thinking of actually breaking the CD in half due to its offensiveness. This is, hands down, the worst game I ever bought. The only thing saving me from destroying the game is that I want to return it for a real game, like Triple-Play 2002."
2,This is a bad game,This is a baaaaaad game--it's not fun and the graphics have no realism. Im a hardcore gamer and i especially like sports games but this is a crudy game. I strongly DO NOT recommend this
1,asb 2003,"I think this is a fun game but is very repetive and gets boring after a half hour...You cannot play asb 2003 all day like you could with Halo, Madden 2002, nhl 2002, or NBA live 2002"
2,"Unbelieveably overrated,","Okay. When this game came out I was really excited. i own all of the previous all-star baseballs for N64 and had high hopes for this one. But heres the deal, this game is terrible. It's way too slow to get excited about. theres only one camera mode. you can't adjust the number of innings you want ( there will always be 9 inning games). i almost went out and bought this game but i decided to read a couple of reviews first. this guy said it should be rented first because he didn't believe it was that great. I did that and wow. Im really glad I didn't waste 50 dollars. If you want a real game get Halo or Airforce Delta storm."
5,OSU wall clock,I was extremely pleased in the product and the service of the company. It will go in my grandson's newely painted bedroom. He loves football and OSU football. emma Dixon
3,First Review,"I bought this camera mainly for the price and 3.1MP although i could find no review comments on this as i searched the entire net. So here I go with my findings:Pros:--Small and compact--low price--comes with the camera case, has 7MB internal memory and takes SD--light weightCons:--Although it says, its 3.1 MP its just equivalent to 2MP (so don expect more)--the pics are not bright in low light, and otherwise also the pictures are not sharp enough.--just does the job."
3,First Review,"I bought this camera for the price, even though i could find no review comments and i searched the entire web. Well here are my findings. Hope this helpsPros:--small and compact--light weight--low price--Comes with the camera case (unlike sony)Cons:--Even though it says 3.1mp, its just like a 2mp image.--Images are dull in evenings (less light) and otherwise also they are not very sharp"
2,Not happy with camera,"I bought this camera about 6 months a go. Within 2 hours of purchasing it, I was already taking pictures with it. My friend, who owns a Canon Powershot was taking the same pictures as me and I was immediatly unhappy with the concord. All of my pictures turned out blurry unless you kept the camera in the same postition even after you took the picture. The flash made pictures blue sometimes. It takes okay outdoor pictures but the battery life is very low. The video quality is good but there is no sound. When purchasing my next digital camera, I will make sure that I'm using a better-known, trustworthing brand"
3,good for new teachers,this book is nice for new teachers but not that much for those who have been working for over a year or two
5,Another great hymn CD from Ford,"When the worst thing I can say about this CD is that it only has ten tracks, that is a good thing. On this CD, Tennessee Ernie Ford sings some of the most beautiful hymns ever written, and he does so as well as I have ever heard. For the person who loves these songs, the versions by Ford are absolutely not to be missed."
4,Good Starting Point For Functional Training,"This book is a good basis for functional training for anyone who is attemtping to make the switch from traditional training philosophies to more sport specific functional training philosophies. Although it lacks a tremendous amount of scientific backing, the concepts as a whole make sense and can be a valuable tool to make the transition to functional training. This book is not for the person who already has incorporated functional training into their own program design or the program design of their athletes. If you are already using functional training methods, this book will seem basic and simple with little or no new information from what you are already applying in your workouts, but if you want to understand why the deadlift is superior to prone hamstring/leg curl for speed development and why push-ups are better than traditional bench press then this book may be right for you."
4,Welcome to the Dark Ages,Nigel Tranter brought a glimmer of light to the Drk Ages.We have Christendom enetering lives......and there is nothing but TROUBLE in Scotland dueing this first millennium. With a profound thrust Mr. Tranter has thrown the reader into complete chaos!Cery good read!
4,Best Looking Skull Shift Knob Around,"The Good: This really is the best looking skull shift knob that I've ever seen... and that's why it got four stars and I don't mind that it was $16. It's solid metal and has a nice weight to it. The finish is perfect.The Bad: When I saw that it was made by Summit, I assumed that ment Summit racing. Well, it's not, and that's fine. At first glance at the package it looks to be made by a company called ""SHIFT KNOB,"" written in spooky letters, haha. It's about 25% too small to really feel good in your hand. It's a lot smaller than I expected it to be. It doesn't come with the ""rubber insert"" that's mentioned in the add. It also lacks a screw or something of the sort to secure it to the gear shift post.The Bottom Line: If you want a great looking shift knob and don't mind figuring out a way to secure it to your gear shift, then this is a good one."
1,Dissapointed,"I got this item as a gift from my wife since it was on my ""wish list.""Got the knob and it doesn't fit...anything. There's no way to make it attach to the stick.Don't buy this! You'll be disappointed. No washer, etc. to make it fit."
1,no way to fit... what is the point?,"This knob makes a nice paperweight. But it comes with a large, unthreaded hole in the bottom. A rubber stopper was included, but the hole in the stopper was way too small for a gear shift handle. It's pretty, but useless. Thanks for nothing."
4,Great Workout,"This is such a great workout. It is totally cheesy, but it makes you sweat. I like the countdown aspect the best - it makes it seem like it goes by faster. I highly recommend it. I first did the workout in college when a friend had the tape. I remembered liking it so much that I searched for it, found it on Amazon and was able to break out the old VCR to use it. It is just as I remember it - a good workout that is challenging and relatively short."
1,"This was a mistake, for sure.","Note the dates. It is so out of date, it has only historical value. Was not helpful for my needs at all."
5,It works,My wife used this on our vacation in florida. She was able to stay out in the sun and water without getting the least bit red. Highly recommend Blue Lizard!!
4,too expensive,The was recommended by my dermatologist. I know it's a great product but it's just so expensive. To prices for my purse.
1,Didn't do anything,"I purchased this based upon the recommendations. I took this on my 4 day trip to Puerto Rico the week of August 1st. After lubing up very well and letting it sit for half an hour I trekked out to the ocean. I swam for 30 minutes in the ocean and then walked the beach with my wife for an hour. I got back and could already feel a burning a sensation. It was already too late, I got an extreme sunburn on my shoulders, neck, ears, chest, and back. It's so bad the doctor said I had sun-poisoning (didn't even know that existed). This did absolutely nothing after a 30 minute swim and one hour walk. The rest of the trip I was in agony in the shade praying the sun wouldn't hit me.. Ruined the trip for me.."
1,Not on CD,"Album from 1958 by the brilliant flamenco guitarist Sabicas (1912-90), which (as far as I'm aware) has never appeared on CD.Tracks 2 & 4 and 6-9 are songs by Enrique Montoya; the Danza Mora is a guitar solo, transcribed inSelected Solos for Guitar by Sabicas & Escudero(Hansen, 1962). The others are guitar duets with either Sabas's brother Diego or Mario Escudero. Anita Ramos provides castanets.Track 9 is mislabelled a Granadina; it is in fact a Soleá (track 6 is a Granadina)But this album was recorded in stereo, and Amazon's samples sound to me like mono! Ecchh. It's like listening through a hole in the wall. In my opinion you'd be better off with the stereo LP (ABC-Paramount ABCS-239)."
1,OPPS,"I READ IN THE DESCRIPTION THAT IT WAS A FOLDONGCANE. WELL, IT'S NOT.I DO USE IT ON OCCSSION.I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A FOLDING CANE.I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE TO GETWHAT I WANT.I MUST ADD IT IS GOOD LOOKING."
4,Great case...but not easy to take in and out,"This case is great and definately protects my Ipod while still making it easy for me to access all of its functions. My only complaint is that it is difficult to put the Ipod back in the case after removing it to, for example, use with my car converter. Great if you plan to keep it in the case at all times though!"
3,Not the Best,"Within 5 minutes of owning this case, the thing was covered in dirt and lint. It's impossible to get off, too. Also the part that covers the ""Hold"" switch is annoying and makes the switch hard to use."
5,Great buy,"Great case, fits snug. Protects everything. Maybe a bit pricey for a case, but it's worth it in the end. I know from now on when looking for cases for my Ipods to come I will check Iskin first."
5,Insane how waterproof this jacket is.,THIS JACKET WILL NOT KEEP YOU WARM WHATSOEVER but if you're looking to stay dry.. This jacket is the bees knees that you knead. I live in western washington and get dumped on by rain basically 4 months out of the year and have found this extremely portable jacket to be endlessly useful and a regular facet of my outfits due to that factor.
4,Solid Jacket,"I got this jacket for a steal @ $70 and it was well worth it. Fit is true to size, hood is solid and I like that there's a soft liner around the neck area. Pit zips are useful. I haven't had an extreme downpour to test it fully, but the rain slides of in moderate rain and left me dry."
4,It's worth every penny!,"When I bought this, I was coming away from a North Face rain jacket I had purchased many years ago, which put up with every second of abuse I threw at it until a little tumble off my mountain bike caused it to get torn up on some rocks. So I find this jacket, at an unbeatable price, and decide to jump on it. After owning this for a few months, I can tell you that this jacket is outstanding for some very heavy downpours and light drizzles all the same. Very breathable and comfortable. Will definitely be recommending this to my friends."
2,Not the quality I expected,The jacket was not of the quality I was looking for. I returned the jacket and purchased the Marmot Oracle jacket which is the same type jacket but much better quality.
4,Bought for son for Christmas Present,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was delighted. My wife had priced the same type of jacket at one of the big chain sporting goods stores and it was double the price. Great quality, sealed seams and very light weight. Very satisfied."
3,Jacket not as written/ placement,"This jacket is a very light weight coat; not to say it is a bad jacket, just not a heavy winter jacket to wear in the snow or cold weather. This would be more of a spring coat, not a winter coat."
5,Quite possibly the best purchase I've ever made,"I got this on sale and this may be the best jacket I've ever bought. It is a very comfortable jacket, very light weight, works great in the rain. I've used it hiking and just as a light jacket around town. Packs down really small and has just enough insulation that I absolutely love this jacket. The pit zips help release any excess heat. It breathes enough that you won't sweat yourself out unless you'd do that anyways. Anyone complaining is looking for a more expensive jacket in the not-so-expensive jacket range. They're just being unreasonable. Buy this jacket and thank me later. You will not regret it."
3,Nothing special.,"I love my older Marmot items, this one falls very short in quality - mass produced item. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing special. A little flimsy."
4,Great Wet-Weather Jacket,"This is a great, lightweight (yet still warm) wet weather jacket. I'm tall (6'2"" and 215lbs)and was going to order an XL, but after reading other reviews claiming it runs slightly big I took a chance with the Large and it fits perfectly. Sleeves are a great length, hood is comfortable and I have room to wear a heavier shirt/light sweater underneath. I also really like that the armpits unzip for ventilation (this was a god send on my last muggy & rainy trip to Florida). My only complaint - and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars - is that the openings of the side pockets are a little high and awkward to get into."
5,Marmot Precip,This is my second Marmot Precip Rain Jacket. I stll have the first onewhich I bought when my wife and I went to Alaska. I also used it extensively while backpacking and enjoying other outdoor actvities. The main reason for this purchase was because I wanted a garment that blended in more to the environment. I have taken up fly fishing and the red doesen't do a very good job of camouflage.
3,Nice jacket but check sizing,"I have owned several PreCip jackets. The are a great jacket for the price. They keep you dry, are relatively light, and compact down. My problem with this particular purchase was that the size was not as advertised. I ordered a Men's small and received a unisex small which is a bitter smaller than the advertised Men's size. The result is a jacket that is tighter than my previous jackets. As I was leaving on a trip to Alaska I did not have time to return it. The jacket got 5 weeks of use in Alaska and came out great. Nice product but check the size."
5,Outstanding Quality in design and materials,"I am so pleased with the exacting fine details in the construction and design of the Marmot PreCip Jacket. I have sewed professionally for 'Eskimo Designs' products and can say that the Marmot products meet our exacting standards. The materials (nylon) have a wonderful ""hand"" (which means the fabric conforms to your contour, feels like a natural, does not behave like flexible plastic) There are many features in this jacket such as under-arm zippered vents, adjustable hood size, velcro-cuff closures that function perfectly. I am amazed that such a quality product can be offered at such a reasonable price. I have purchased three for the family.My only reservation ...... my preference is for a more loosely-fitted garment. A jacket that billows as you move may not be a fashion item, but functions to vent perspiration. I suggest you purchase a size larger that normal to achieve this function.Regardless, I recommend without reservation."
3,ok,"jacket is ok, works to keep you dry. The reason for being titled ok is that this jacket is not made of the material I thought it would. I climb telephone poles for work and I need something durable and this jacket is very thin light material. It is perfectly good for someone to wear, I have just already torn mine in just a few wearings."
4,"Great fit, good looks",I'm giving this a four star review only because I haven't been out in the rain in it yet. But it is super light and packs down very small but also doesn't feel flimsy. Hopefully I get a rainy day to try it out.
4,prompt shipping speed!,"Very thin and light, yet very warm. So I doubt the so called breathable technology. Yet this could be a good thing when the weather gets cold. The appearance is not as fancy as I expected, yet good enough to wear. The details of the jacket is very professional. Overall it's a good jacket! I will see how it works in a rainy day."
3,great price,purchased used book; appearance was as expected. took a long time to ship but was coming from the UK. Give yourself about 2 weeks especially if it is a gift :)
5,Nice for sure...!,This is a nice blade for sure. It is very sharp and came very quickly after ordering. Packaging was kind of big but that wasn't a problem for me. I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to my friends.
4,Pretty good.,"My first draw knife, i consider it sharp, it feels solid. Works pretty good, doesn't take much strength to shave the trunk."
4,good,"it seems to work well enough. in some of the other reviews they said it was surprisingly sharp, but when it arrived it felt pretty dull. i tried using it on a stave i have for a bow im working on. worked so much better than i thought it would, given the fact that it appears to be super dull"
1,TRUELY AWFUL FRUIT SLICES!!!,THESE ARE SOME OF THE WORST FRUIT SLICES CANDY I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE!!! THESE HAVE NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER.....LIKE EATING PASTE.CANDY FRUIT SLICES ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A STRONG FLAVOR.........THESE BARELY HAVE ANY FLAVOR AT ALL...........TRUELY HORRIBLE!!!
4,"Good for Baby Boomers, Not as good for Gen X and Y","Browsing through these reviews, and having read the book, something dawned on me that's not been commented on yet: This book is very much written for those of the Baby Boom (and older) Generation. Things have changed dramatically in the mental health profession, and for the ""differently abled"" in recent years. I myself am a Generation Xer, and to me the author's voice came across as ignorant and self-indulgent. However, my mother-in-law, a Baby Boomer with a brother who has mild mental dysfunction, felt this book was incredibly enlightening for a person who came of age at the same time as the author."
4,Riding the Bus with My Sister Review,"I really thought this book was touching. As a major in Special Education, it was good to see what Rachel's thoughts were when it came to her sister. As for Beth, it allowed me to learn more about someone who has an intellectual disability. I recommend this book because it allows you to see into the life of a family who has a child with a disability. It also allows someone to see and understand a person who has a mild intellectual disability."
3,Good book everyone should read.,"I found this book to be very interesting and moving. It has really made a mark on my heart. I have a special needs child who unlike ""Cool Beth"" is not treated differently by many, yet sees some of the same prejudices. It was nice to read a book that shows how a person can live on their own and have the same things that so called ""normal"" people can. I appreciated that Beth knew right from wrong and is not afraid to express that to the world around her. We can all learn from that. The annoyance that Rachel gets from Beth is such a tough feeling for a sibling/parent, but a genuine one and written with such truth. This will not be enjoyed by all, but all can learn from it."
2,Thank God I Have a Car,"I got this book from our office ""library,"" where people leave off books they've finished for others to pick up. Opening it to the middle and scanning a few sentences, I thought it would be interesting. And it was, for a while. It's about the author and her retarded sister, who rides the buses in her city all day, every day. The author is trying to discover her sister by riding the bus with her. It holds up for about half the book, but after a while you realize the sister is lazy, obnoxious, and socially indifferent. She gets really tiresome after a while, and therefore, unfortunately, so does the book. I ended up being much more interested in the vignettes from the sisters' past life experience, especially about their mother. Now that would be a story worth writing--and reading. Better luck next time, author."
2,disappointing read,"I didn't really like this book because it got boring really fast. It got to the point where i just wanted to drop the book. It was repetitive, and it didn't go into details in parts where it should have. I thought it could have been a lot shorter also. It dragged out for pages about things it already said. I found myself always asking, ""What is she trying to say?"" It was kind of hard to follow at points because it some parts didn't exactly make sense. Someone else might like it, but i didn't."
1,Zzzzz...,"OK, first off I would like to say that this IS an enlightening book about how mentally disadvantaged people are treated in everyday life. For the first chapter. It should have stopped then. I'm sorry but the only thing I can find useful about this book besides that is that it is an AWESOME sleep aide."
2,...And Again,"The concept of this book, spending time with a challenged sister, has many possibilities. Unfortunately, the result doesn't follow the anticipation. The basic thesis of the book is that the author, a journalist, decides to spend one day per month for a year riding the bus with her sister ""Beth"" in order to gain some insight into her life. The author is introduced each month to a different driver who has various strengths which s/he shares both with Beth and the author. As I said, the concept is interesting, but after two or three months of bus drivers, I found myself thinking, ""Okay, let's get on with it!"" The reading became tedious not because of the style per se but because of the format."
2,Not for everyone,"While this book seems to have little but rave reviews, I can't say I was overly impressed by it. Frankly, I felt that I'd read the story before. Just because it's a true story doesn't mean that it can't be hackneyed and annoying, and this certainly was. Rachel was your typical clueless, booksmart girl, and Beth was your typical wise-beyond-her-years-if-retarted inspiration. The story itself is episodical--don't read this if you're looking for a coherant plot. It reflects real life, which appeals to some, but not to me. ""Riding the Bus"" is very well-written, which at some points was its only saving grace. But even the style can't save the disaster that was an epilogue, that completely threw me out of the story and had my head shouting ""where did that come from!?"" Overall, it may be someone's cup of tea, but not everyone will enjoy it."
2,Not very effective in our application,"My wife and I bought this for our insect problems with our indoor citrus trees in January, and used it about sixty days ago. While there was an immediate kill of most the fungus gnats and some of a type of scale insects or aphids attacking the trees, the problems were back within about three weeks (emphasizing these trees were indoors and ALL treated together).The applications were in accordance with the instructions. I rate the product as probably safe applied according to directions, but for us, it was not effective. It certainly might be effective on other pests, but we were, after all, indoors."
3,Bonide 202 Fruit Tree Spray,This product works OK but not nearly as well as the banned products I used to use. I keep hoping a new product will come to market that is as effective as the old banned products but until that happens I will continue to use the Bonide.
5,Perfect and original present for birthday,At the time I ordered this flowers I was far away in Moscow from my boyfriend. I wanted to send him something to make him smile! It worked! He loved it!
4,One Face of Ray Charles,"Not classic Ray Charles, not even classic Ray Charles blues, but a very interesting presentation. I am pleased that I purchased this and have added it to my music mix. However, I'll probably only play it straight to demonstrate to another listener. (I still have some Ray Charles' instrumentals beyond piano on 50s vinyl.)"
2,Empty message and hype,I read this when it first came out. The theme of the book is to save yourself for marriage and preserve your virginity for oh so long. IMO this is no guarantee of successfully obtaining or retaining a viable mate. Women who abstain for sex for too long outside of nuns are usually very cranky and unhappy. Even Brooke went on to say how she wished she had not waited so long in having sex for the first time many years after this book in effect contradicting herself. The whole sex/virginity thing is overrated anyway. This is nothing more than empty hype of saving yourself for marriage.
4,Great music...crappy guitar solos,"I bought this album when I was 13 years old back in 1986. I loved it then, I love it now. The music is very solid. The singing is better than Mark Slaughter, and the songs are very catchy. Vinnie's rhythem playing is very cool, but the solos [are bad]. His playing is sloppy, uncontrolled, and monotonous. I know of a million guys that can play faster and cleaner than Vinnie...That aside, the songs are really good, and Vinnie's rhythems are great. Buy this album, but don't get excited about the fast playing, because, believe me, it is very sub-par. My favorites include ""Shoot ya full of Love"", ""Twisted"", ""Boyz r gonna Rock"", and ""Do ya wanna make love"". The last 3 minutes of ""Invasion"" is the biggest waste of space."
1,Not pleased,"I ordered this 8 gig card with new horizons in mind. I shoot with a professional Canon 10D EOS. My camera, after 3.4 gigs was used up on the Lexar card, could no longer write to the card fast enough and all images become corrupt thereafter. Since I had only read positive reviews for the card, I was way to sure of this card and used it during a wedding shoot. I'm thankful I had plenty of 1 and 2 gig cards as back up. Further investigation opened up the notion that this card cannot be maximized by any camera other then the higher end SLR professional cameras that are new to the market - so if you don't own a high end SLR and just have a normal SLR professional like myself, this card isn't going to work for you. Atleast not past 3.4 gigs."
5,Speed That Makes A Difference,"I shoot a Canon 5D and work with dancers in performance. The shooting is quick, often strings of many frames with the camera running as fast as it will cycle. When I changed from 133x cards to 300x cards, I noticed a significant improvement in the speed with which the camera's buffer clears, allowing longer strings and better readiness for more shooting. This is only going to be more important with newer cameras having higher resolution and faster cyclic rates. This Lexar and the Sandisk Extreme Ducati series claim the 45MB/sec performance level. I use both with equal satisfaction. I have recently switched from 4GB to 8GB cards to reduce the number of reloads necessary during a job."
4,Dutch(1991)****,"This movie is awsome, one of my favorites. Ed O'Neil and Ethan Randal are great in this movie. Its a about goofy Dutch (ed o'neil) who offers to bring home his girlfriends cocky son Doyle (ethan randal) from his private school in Georgia . Dutch forces him to come (even after doyle throws a book at his head , hits him in the arm with a golf club, kicks him in the balls, and shoots him with a bb gun). As they struggle to make there way home (after Dutches's car is destroyed,and there money is stolen)they learn to respect each other and become friends. Ive loved this movie since ive first saw it about 7 years ago. Great comedy to watch on Thanksgiving. Definetly see it.Watch for the famous card trick scene;)"
5,A Christmas favorite,"My daughter loves this movie, so i put it in her stocking for Christmas. She was thrilled as you don't see it on TV very often."
5,Dutch,"I enjoy a good comedy, but this was a great comedy, it's a 5 Star all day long. Get this for your Library."
4,Be patient!,"This is a good movie that takes awhile to develop. If you don't sit through the obnoxious son showing how bad he is, then you will miss his transition to a pretty good kid. Dutch is what he is a blue collar guy that although hard nosed, has a heart of gold. This is one of those roadtrips that shows the seemy side of life and the school of hard knocks. Good family entertainment. I recommend for rental first. It may not suit all tastes."
2,Poor Quality DVD,I love this movie and watch it every Christmas. I was extremely happy to be able to finally find it on DVD. However I was very disappointed in the quality of the reproduction to DVD. I kept the DVD just because of my love for the movie. I have older movies on DVD with much better quality.
3,Ok.......seen better,"It was entertaining for about 20 minutes into the movie, after that it lost my attantion because of some of the slap stick humor, and crude humor. The ending was sweet as the two poeple came together. overal it was good, but really not the best I have sen from him."
4,Home Alone meets Maried With Children,This coming of age story combines hokey comedics with moving family sentiment as Doyle the spoiled 12-year-old learns to warms up to Dutch (Ed O'Neil) the father-in-law to be. In the process Doyle learns the value of hard work and tuff love.Wil Ranney
4,DUTCH,Every time I was flipping the channels and Dutch was on I would end up staying on the channel and watching it. I hated Married with Children so I was very suprised that I like this movie.
5,A great movie that everyone should watch.,"Ed O' Neil and Ethan Randall are great in this movie. Ed O' Neil(Dutch), has to go to pick up his girlfriend's son(Doyle) at his school for thanksgiving. Dutch takes him even though Doyle doesn't want to go. They end up having there car destroyed, there luggage gets stolen, and eventually learn to put up with each other. A great movie with a great moral. (In my opinion, the best scene of the movie is at the gas station after they get robbed.) Give this movie a chance. You will probobly be happy you did."
1,Very bad movie. Nothing happens.,"This is a very bad movie. Even if you are familiar with Ray Dennis Steckler you may get disappointed. It's about a woman, Carolyn, who inherits a ranch where there's a little shack. If you go into that shack, bad things will happen. Okay, so the people in the movie go in there and bad things happen. Sounds pretty much like your average Z grade horror movie, but this is much worse, because that's not really what the movie is about, except for a few minutes. The rest of the running time is made up of Carolyn walking around and looking at horses and things like that and nothing happens. Why would I want to waste time watching that if I want to see a horror film? It also doesn't meet the qualifications to be ""so bad it's good"", simply because it's so boring. Don't waste your time and money."
5,Best sun screen,"I am a very fair skinned individual and burn easily. So I use sun screens alot. My dematologist gave me a sample to try. It is much more liquid in it's consistency than many sun screens. It is very easy to apply, and has a pleasant fragrance. Best of all it works great! It stays effective even with activity, for quite a while. It is virtually impossible to find in stores. It costs more, but seems to last longer. I would definitely recommend it."
4,Good read - much better if read in order!,I read this book several months ago - and relly was quite confused - recently I read My Lady Notorious and realized why - these books need to be read in order. Why authors do not make this more clear is beyond me - one would think they would want us to enjoy them to the fullest. So much of what happens in Tempting Fortune is based on the relationships of the first book. Tempting is a good book - I loved Bright Malloren a lot as the male rouge hero - he had for me great appeal. There were many times though that I found Portia a little hard to take - she seemed attracted but so difficult. If I were Bright by the end of the book I would have told her to perhaps hit the road. I thoroughly do enjoy this series of Beverley books and I did the series of the Rouges. Jo Beverley is one of the best!
1,Tempting Fortune,"This book had one of the most asinine story lines and unlikeable characters I have ever encountered in any book of its genre. The heroine was totally unlikeable. (How many times do we need to have a character climb out a window?) I literally rolled my eyes several times at the absurd situations and dialogue. All the characters were inconsistent in motives and traits, wordplay with ""Maidenhead"" and ""The Thames"" was corny, the twists in the plot were exasperating rather than exciting and the love scenes were affected. I honestly read to the end in hopes that the hero would murder the heroine, Portia St.Claire and her brother so the story would have a satisfying conclusion. No, the ending was just as forgettable as the rest."
3,tempting fortune? more like tempting annoyance!,"For the life of me, I cannot understand why Bryght is with Portia. She's has a nasty habbit of running away (three times in the book!), she's rude to him, and she's extremely hot-headed! The herorine in this book really annoyed me. It took me two weeks to finish off this novel because I was too frustrated with her. Don't get me wrong, the storyline was interesting enough, but there were times when I just wanted to chuck the book at the wall. Maybe the next book in this series is better..."
5,My favorite,"I've read most of Jo Beverley's books, this one was the first one I found and I enjoyed it very much. Portia is very likeable. Bryght is utterly fascinating. I recommended this book to everyone."
2,Don't waste your time,"My advise to anyone looking to read this book, is don't waste your time. The plot of the story has real potential. A head-strong country girl is in the mist of trying to regain her family's home after her brother gambled it away.The down fall however, is not so much the story but the characters,with the main disappointment being the heroine Portia. The opening chapters you see a glimpse of strong a personality, however by the end of the book the few intriguing traits she has have turned the reader sour. This book litearlly had me shooting to Portia ""why are you so stupid."" Due to the lack of development of the heroin it's hard to follow why the hero fell in love with her or root for a happy ending."
4,"Nice story, strong message","In this book you will see how a woman who doesn't like any kind of bets, she bets not once but three times with Bryght Malloren and she lost the three times, so here we can learn that if you don't like to do something just don't do it.This book will keep you reading the story of super heroine Portia St. Claire who climbs all kind of walls and super hero Bryght Malloren who is always there to save her.This love story is kind of different from others, if I tell you why I will tell you the main story (the three bets that she lost) and I think that this is a nice book to read.In the other hand of the love story, you can see how gambling could make rich people poor."
1,"Tempting, balderdash","This book is not worth one star. I haven't even finished it, but I don't think I will. The characters are sooooo boring. I can't find the romance that I like about Jo Beverley's books. I am an avid reader and find myself diisapointed lately with the ""Historical Romances"" This book is not worth reading. Maybe if I had read the first book it might be different,but I don't think so."
3,Quick Once Over,"This book appears to contain a selection of recipes from an earlier book on Eastern European cooking by the same contributors.It contains recipes for the better known dishes of the region with some introductory prose. An attractive gift as an introduction to the Polish/Russian kitchen but less useful as a reference work for the serious slavophile cook.I have never prepared any of the recipes and cannot, therefore, comment on their workability."
3,More a picture book than a buyer's guide,"This is fine as an illustrated guide to the different models, as there is a large photo and usually a few smaller detail photos for each model, along with some technical statistics following the photos, and snippets of owner commentary. The introductory ""Buyer's Guide"" chapter is a good 5-6 page guide on what to look for when evaluating a used BMW, or other brand for that matter. The rest of the guidance comes in the form of a 1-2 page intro to each model in which the changes to and quirks of the particular year or model are discussed, and then notes on the photos with arrows pointing to the problem areas on the car.I guess I was expecting a bit more detail on what makes one BMW a better buy than another, comparisons of the different models, series, etc. Instead, I found the actual buying advice, while valuable, a bit skimpy."
4,A good read if you are shopping for a used BMW,"This actually is a pretty good book. There are a number of color photos for each car (it covers 2002's-e46 BMWs, even M models and the 8 series!) with text captions for problems to look for for each car. It lists the specifications for each model and provides a handy summary of repair costs and parts costs for items such as bumpers, fuel pumps, oil filters etc. I don't remember seeing a pricing guide for each car, but such information can easily be found in a bluebook or a website.This isn't a repair manual, but definatly gives a prospective buyer a number of things to think about and look for when shopping for a used BMW."
3,mmmm,See that book does what its design to but only that and with so few info its hard to recommends the book over all the info you can finds on the differents Bmw forums.
2,Not very informative!,"Nice photos but not very informative! Only has a short amount of info on most models. Could be better, not a great detail book. Not enough detailed information."
4,Excellent book for third-year medical students.,"This book gives a great overview of OB/GYN. It is helpful for the NBME shelf copies. Not very in-depth, desgined more for review as opposed to reference."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my four year old grandson, to help with letter formation. As your finger starts to follow and trace the letter, the voice goes back to the beginning and never gets to the ending steps. Also, it jumps around from one activity to another as you turn pages. Seems like there should be a separate ""story"" button. I had to send the first one I ordered back because the volume was too low and could not be turned up. The volume is o.k. on this one, but I wonder if the wiring is off in other areas. It's just not what I was expecting, as other Vtech items I have purchased were quite good."
2,Better off with something else,"This DVD has a number of very skilled ballroom champions showcasing different dances. I guess the DVD isn't bad for a beginner who wants a no-nonsense review of what each of the dances look like. But for someone looking for more, the performances lack the energy and technical proficiency of champion level couples performing in a competition setting.The set and the editing are also amateurish. Many times the camera angles changes and you are stuck with a view that is obscured by a flower pot or other ridiculous pieces of the thrown together scenery.The music is not good and often times it seems that the music that is on the tape is different from what the couples were listening to live.All in all disappointing."
2,NOTHING IMPRESSIVE,this DVD is really just scenes from some dances... but technique is not so well and the series are not so impressive... If you are watcing dance comp. on Eurosports than no need to buy this DVD...
3,"feeling to burn, unfortunately unnoticed outside Britain","I came accross this band while in Scotland in the late 80's, and was instantly taken with their silky pop lyrics, and underlying harmonic melodies. The title track ""Hue and Cry"" is probably the pick, though this is one of those albums you'll play start to finish, and it just grows on you. I've got to admit to a fair bit of nostalgic bias where this album is concerned, but if you enjoy good vocals based on serious harmonies, this ones for you."
4,Is that a GIANT SLUG in your pocket...?,"Great, traditional Doctor Who monster story. Genetic mutations are occurring within the population of Baktan and the Doctor has found out the cause (see front cover pic - arrrggghh!!!) You'll find the Doctor beaten up a lot more than usual, Compassion is changing slightly, and Fitz, well, it's revolutionary and girl trouble again for him. Baxendale has a great way in describing his planetary landscape, especially conveying the increasing need and survival the people of the desert city Baktan for water. Nice short chapters urge the story on, so it makes it hard to put the book down. RECOMMENDED to all!!!"
3,A New Author for the Eighth Doctor,"Trevor Baxendale does a decent job of writing for the Eighth Doctor. He manages to come up with an interesting Plot line, as well as using Fitz and Compassion in a decent manner. The only thing that I would say is that it would be best to read some of the other books, especially Paul Cornell's The Shadows of Avalon, to understand some of the things that are going on in this book. Overall, a well done book, and I look forward to reading more from this author."
2,The BBC Falls Flat Again,"Coldheart is the worst Doctor Who novel in about a year. The pace is extremely slow. Fitz is back to being an immature, sarcastic imbecile. I thought Mr. Baxendale's previous Doctor Who novel, The Janus Conjunction, was much better. What made the editors at BBC choose this book?"
3,Pretty Good Cage,"It's a good cage over all. Lots of things for your Hamster to explore and smell. You have a lot of space for chewing sticks, huts, food bowls etc etc.The bad part about it is putting it together and it's kinda a pain to clean if your hamster poops in every level or doesn't poop in the hamster potty you give it.But if you don't mind having to spend sometime picking poop of the two top levels and putting the thing together this is the best cage for you. =3"
2,Wrong size,"Amazon says this cage is 42x42x43 inches. If it was, it would fit several rabbits or a boa constrictor. Very disappointed to learn they lied about the size."
3,Good enough,"I bought it for about $40 (cant remember total now). I wouldn't want to pay more than that.Pros-- My hamster loves it! it is very spacious, very comfortable and cozy.Cons--The tubes are sooo annoying! I have to use tape to keep them together and attached to the rest of the cage. The wheel? too noisy! had to buy a new one. The bottle? too difficult for the hamster to use it...so, my hamster just drinks from the yellow container.If it came with a better wheel and bottle, I'd give it another star; and if the tubes were easy to install and easy to maintain attached and clean...I'd rate it 5 stars! But, to me, it is simply ok."
4,Tube Trouble,"This is an overall decent cage, but the tubes are extremly(impossible) difficult to set up. This was kids trying, but they still managed after at least an hour trying. The hamsters, which are dwarf, love the litter box and house. They found the tubes a little scary at first, but finally got the hang of it.We have not had the cage for that long but the cleaning looks pretty easy just the floors are going to be a little challenging.The wheel is like any other wheel it makes a little noise but definetly not bad.Overall, our three dwarf hamsters love all the space and It is worth the tube trouble! :) We would reccomend it and it is surprising how cheep it is! This is an awesome cage for everyone!"
3,"Great for base, but parts need improvement","I like the size of the cage. The plastic pieces that hold everything together break very easy. When I got the package one of the corner pieces was already broken and had to order extra ones. Luckily the costumer service was very helpful. The tubes are a nightmare. They are made of cheap plastic. The pieces don't stay together and don't fit in the holes. I had to buy different ones from the pet store that work perfectly. I also changed to water bottle, my hammies had troubles getting water out of it. The little house is very cute, but the top doesn't click in place either.It's a little expensive, considering that I had to replace the accessories."
1,Please confirm size,"HI,I bought this product because of the size you advertise it has but I checked other websites and I am told is not true that is 42X42X53 inch as you say it is.If is not 42X42X53"" I would like to cancel the order as the size was the only reason I ordered it.Regards,ioan mitulescu"
5,Sharing poetry and so much more,"This book takes readers inside a world most of us have never entered: a maximum security prison. But instead of showing the aspects of this world that we're familiar with from movies and TV, we see something different. By telling her own story -- the story of a poet sharing poetry with a particular group of prisoners -- Tannenbaum allows readers to look at our own assumptions about prison, prisoners and what it is to be human.This is a very important, and very moving, book."
3,Good but....,"The book is Good but the price is in real terms a rip-off, at almost 50 pounds in english money, is alot for someone on state benefits however i accept that the delivery costs had to be paid, one good point is it arrived 3 days after payment was taken? This needs looking into how it costs so much in a time of recession, and for a paperback, i wonder who is really gaining from all of this?"
5,Content,I have been looking for this book for some time. E-bay has it but bidding took it out of my price range. So I was pleased that it was published in an affordable way for me to purchase it. Even though it isn't an original it is still very well put together.
3,"good, but not great","louis logic has great flow, is an excellent lyricist, and usually has ill beats behind him. what i dont understand is why he isnt serious with any of the tracks on this cd. he is intelligently witty and has a dark, albeit appealing, sense of humor and he deserves the comparisons to the old em. however, in order to get serious respect, you would think he would have to make a single serious track, which he doesnt on sin-a-matic. everything is the same sarcastic humorous stuff. it is a fun cd for the mere fact that no one can spit wit with a flow that is as on-point as louis logic, but the homogeneity in style makes it somewhat bland. he has all the tools to be one of the best emcees out, underground or commercial, but he doesnt show the maturity to do so. this is closer to a jerky boys cd than a jewel from nas or eminem."
3,Hmmmmm does this require skill or good guessing?,"ASB2003 starts off like a regular baseball game. You pick your team, start a season, and you're off. The first thing i noticed about this game, is the large amount of information before, during, and after a game. Graphicaly, this game is very good. Most of the graphics are very solid during gameplay.The game looks and feels great up to the point where your batter steps up to the plate. I often felt that i got lucky when hittting the ball. The pitches are way to fast, and your target cursor way to slow. I found myself guessing where the ball would be thrown. Ok, now that you get lucky and hit the ball, now what? Base running is pretty simple in this game. And fielding and pitching are very solid. If it weren't for the awful batting aspect, this game could have been great."
1,Baseball Video Game from 1983,"This game has nothing to engage any player. The game interface is so hard to use that you will want to give up after just a few games. Once you do realize how to use the controls it becomes clear that the game is just slow to respond making it frustrating to play and a complete waste of time. I'm suprised they would even put this on the market when other far better games exist. This is like playing baseball on the Apple IIe. Don't bother with this game, just get Triple Play."
2,Why can't they make a good baseball game?,"This game is much more frustrating than it is fun. The main problem with the game is the batting. You can have the setting on easy or regular. On easy batting you hit the first pitch all the time, so the opposing pitcher throws three or four pitches each inning. On regular batting you are lucky if you can get three hits a game. Another problem is the pitcher's stamina. You can have a starting pitcher with a no hitter in the 5th, but he will be completely out of gas. Relievers can pitch about 1 inning before they are done for. Others have said this is the best baseball game out there, which is not saying much about these games.There are many great football and hockey games, so why can't they make a half decent baseball game?"
3,An improvement overlast year but some problems,"Allstar baseball 2003 is an improvement over last years title. The graphics are better and the gameplay is good, but some things hit a miss. Such as you have to play a 9 inning game evertime, which takes about 45 minutes. You can not alter the number of inning you want to play making it almost imposible to play a full season unless you have nothing better to do, also you can not play with your created player ion a regular game only in a season or franchise. Allstar baseball 2003 is an imporvement bu fails to reach th pinnacle of baseball gaming."
1,Short and Sweet,"This was one of the worst baseball games i have ever played. Granted i was very impressed with the features and the graphics, but the gameplay is just awful. When is Acclaim and 3DO going to learn from one another. If you put ASB03' graphics and features with High Heat's game play you would have the greatest baseball game ever!"
1,A VARY BAD GAME,The controlling on this game is odd. You can not hit the ball out of the infield unless you are vary vary lucky. You also can not field the ball vary well there is a star telling you ware to go but when you go into it the ball drops. So over all the game is bad and do not buy it.
1,THE MOST BORING BASEBALL GAME EVER,... I MEAN THE CONTROLS ARE REALLY HARD TO WORK.I PLAYED IT IN ROOKIE AND I COULDNT EVEN HIT A BASEHIT.THE SONG FOR TE GAME IS JUST OLD FASHOINED. YOU HAVE TO AUTOMATICALLY PLAY NINE INNINGS.THERE IS NO POWER SWING THERE IS ONLY NORMAL SWINGS.I WAS PLAYING HOME RUN DERBY I COULDNT EVEN HIT A HOME RUN WITH REGGIE JACKSON.DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Graphics but Needs MORE Options,ASB 2003 has really great graphics but it needs more options. When you play exibition you can't choose the stadium or time of day. When you want to change the line up you have to go through several steps to change. I have to admit that the game play is very cool. The graghics are great and the stadiums are very real along with the fans. It also has details with peoples stance and items they use in the feild. This is a gaame that should be played one game at a time after a while it gets boring. But the game is good along with the great graphics. I give it 4 stars and is a really good baseball game this out there!! :)
5,This Game Is The Bomb,"I love this game. It is the most realistic game for PS2 that is a sports game. The gameplay is awesome, The Hitting is Hard at first but then it gets easier and easier and easier just like the other AllStar Baseball games were. This one makes it better b/c the computer can come back unlike other games were it's 200 to 2 in the 5th inning. The Franchise is The best ever, you can play up 2 20 seasons and sign your free agents and stuff and your created player is 20 yrs old when you start and always gets better. They make a few glitches like catches that shouldn't be but have you ever seen a perfect game were there no mistakes. I have never seen one of those. This game is the best Baseball game for PS2 i suggest you should buy the game!"
2,Seems like a mid-1990's sega genesis game,"Yes, the graphics are decent, but the gameplay is awful. The pitching interface is very annoying and hitting is close to impossible. Maybe I'm just not a baseball-video game type person, but I couldn't get past an inning or two without getting bored and frustrated."
5,Real quick,Great Graphics! Great Game modes and the best overall game I have played for baseball yet. Get this game if you are a big fan of baseball not if you are a big fan of arcade games.
5,"ASB 2003, Best Baseball Game Ever!","ASB 2003 is the best baseball game ever made. The graphics are much better than last year, and now there is an expansion mode and 3 man commentary. Plus all updated rosters, and Home Run Derby. This is a must buy for any baseball fan. It blows away High Heat 2003!"
1,Major disappointment,"All-Star baseball 2001 & 2002 - best baseball games I have ever played. All-Star baseball 2003 - worst. It's simply too hard to hit, even at the easiest setting. Simply makes the game not fun. All you need to know."
1,return this now,Allstar Baseball 2003 was terrible. ASB2001 was the best of all. It was too hard to hit the ball even on rookie mode. The instruction manual told me nothing. It was so overrated. Too little gameplay and the person who made this game should be fired and thrown out on the street.
1,BAD GAME!,"THIS GAME HAS GREAT GRAPHICS AND THE GAME MODES ARE AWSOME,BUT YOU CANT SCORE RUNS.BASE HITS ARE EASY BUT EXTRA BASE HITS ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET,IF U COMBINED THE OPTIONS OF THIS GAME AND THE GAME PLAY OF HIGH HEAT,YOU WOULD HAVE A GREAT GAME.WAIT TO SEE WHAT MLB IS LIKE THIS YEAR BEFORE YOU BY A BASEBALL GAME."
1,return this now,ASB03 was the worst baseball game I have ever played. The graphics were alright but the gameplay was horrific. It was almost impossible to hit the ball. This game was so overrated and I think the person who made this game should be fired an thrown out on the street.
3,This game is ALMOST perfect!,"Pros:Realistic commentaryRealistic stadiumsRealistic playersRealistic gameplayReal mascotsRealistic stadium announcementsRealistic openingsCons:Crowd lacks detailMost of the fans are wearing white shirtsSometimes during an analysis (beginning of game), the analyzer and the stadium announcer are both talking and you can't understand a word they're sayingAnalyst talks like this: (with feeling) Caught by (without) Bonds.Fake advertisements. Justi? The Bay Area Fliers Report? Geez!You can't use historical stadiums in a real game! Only home run derbies and batting practice!You can't play as every team! Only one!You can't make uneven trades!You have a limited franchise term instead of a ""retire"" option!Rookies retire after 1 year!They only do the lineups and defence in the top of the first!"
1,"Graphics may be good, but playing [stinks]","The baserunning [stinks], the hitting [stinks], and the fielding is only marginally better at best. Players are hard to control on base paths, the only challenging hitting is on all-star mode and it [stinks], and the fielders do what they please ehre and there.I'd never buy this game after playing my roommates."
3,Practice makes prefect,When i first started playing i loved the piching and the fielding. The batting was a different story. It was so hard. The 95 mph fastball was almost to realiztic. I don't recomed this game to people who want to have a lot of home runs or to people who don't watch or play baseball much. Overall i thought it was fun but not fun enough to pay [money].
5,Great Game,"Although the players are a lot like they were in the 2002 game, this game is twice as good. There is now a franchise mode and expansion mode which makes the game even more fun. There are more replays and more sayings by the announcers. You can do a lot more with the pitching and the hitting. You can charge the mound, brush-back pitches, and pitch-out on the steal. There are the rookies from last year and the rosters are updated. This makes the game funner and you cant get bored. This is a great game if you are into baseball or you just like different video games. I definately reccommend this game."
2,"bad, stay away","This game is very poor. The graphics are pretty decent until you look at the crowd, then you realize your just playing a video game with a matted crowd, ruined the game. Baserunning is impossible to master, its like, to advance a runner use triangle plus the direction of the base that the runner is on, and some other garbage. You always get out as well when this happens because the computer is actually really smart. Which leads me to my next con. The game in general, simply put is impossible to win. I have it on rookie mode, with easy batting, and assisted fielding, and I still lose games 12-1. You may think this is great because its real, but you get tired of loosing over and over again. And thats with the easiest settings!!! STAY AWAY buy some other game, like ICO, or Jak and Daxter, or Kingdom Hearts or something.LATER"
2,"ok, but needs a lot of work","when i bought all star baseball 2003, i was expecting stellar gameplay along with great graphics and lots of options to choose from. this, however, was not the case. sure, the graphics were excellent, but that was to be expected. i found the gameplay mixed-up and hard to understand. the first ten games i played, i couldn't even catch a fly ball that was hit to the outfield. As for options... wait a minute, what options. this game gives you no way to customise the type of game you want to play. you can't make the game shorter by making less innings; you can't, in my experience, set the game options at all. overall, i would not buy this game. ..."
3,An Adequate Game...,"I haven't played this game enough to have made a final decision, but I want to comment on a few aspects. I don't have time to play full games often, and if you are like me and busy you can set the game to ""manage only"" and generate a count. Doing this, a game takes about 30 minutes.The game has tons of features, including a minor leagues and create a player. It bugs me though that the computer automatically subs for tired players and forces you to use that line up.Also, I don't think the graphics are that good because you only get one camera angle. Then the replay is shown after every play. This wastes time. I wish you could turn that off.I think as time goes by I will have more fun with this game because it has so many features and depth. I would probably buy High Heat 2003 for the PC if my computer was fast enough to run it because I enjoy the simming aspects of baseball games. I think All Star 2003 is probably the best of the console games for simming a season."
2,shiiiite,"Brad Laner should be bludgeoned for pulling Medicine out of the vaults and soiling its name. What an idiot for hanging out with too many IDM kids and thinking he can pull it off himself. If it aint broke, don't fix it."
1,I know garbage when I hear it.,"Oh please, you're from CALIFORNIA. I wouldn't expect you to know the difference anyways."
4,The 90s are over and rightly so....,"Within a space of weeks I got familiar with the Medicine discography. Surely, with 93's Buried Life CD a great shoegazer/noise album was accomplished. What remains to this day are -the weirdness, -sensuality, -occasional pop sensibility. Shannon Lee's vocals are frighteningly sexy and I think that her voice fits in better with this formula than Beth Thompson's, who was on those great feedback driven tunes of yesteryear. Let's face it: it's almost 20 years that Psychocandy from the Jesus & Mary Chain heralded the fusion of 60s melodies with wonderful walls of noise. Now Brad Laner surprises us with a fusion of 60s melodies with current day electronica with makes for a pleasant psychedelic audiotrip. It doesn't seem like The Buried Life, but I can understand that it's made by the same person. Medicine is Brad Laner. Check this out, full stop."
3,"Creative and interesting, but may disappoint old fans","It's hard to rate this one...big fans of IDM might really like it, but as a huge fan of Medicine's first few releases (Short Forth Self Living and The Buried Life) I was hoping for something different I guess. The ringing wall of distorted guitars have been largely replaced be a somewhat dry ""blip bleep"" techno-ish soundscape. Sometimes this sound works for me (Radiohead's ""Idioteque"" from Kid A comes to mind) but after a few listens I still haven't been able to get into this. I give Medicine credit for exploring new sonic territories, but it's such a departure that I almost wonder why they kept the name Medicine (most folks who recognize the Medicine name would also recognize Brad Laner's name). Listen to the samples and decide for yourself."
1,What happened to the old Medicine?,"I honestly wanted to like this album, I really did. Perhaps with a few more listens I'll be able to approach it with an open mind and appreciate it like the positive reviewers -- but at the present moment, I have to say after several tries, it's just as annoying as Bob Mould's recent ventures into techno. Sorry, but it doesn't do it for me. Perhaps it's the fact that when I think of Medicine, I prefer the psychedelic-noise masterpieces that were ""Shot Forth Self Living,"" ""The Buried Life"" and ""Her Highness"", and it's those albums I'd recommend to my friends for the classic and beloved ""Medicine"" sound."
3,Not what I hoped for.,"Just not the same as the first 2. The first 2 where all guitar noise, this sounds good but should probably been released as a new band. A totally different singer and a lot of studio polish make this one a let down of a come back album. It's worth it to seek out the EPs and the 3rd album if you need a fix."
4,Forget the negativity. It's actually pretty good,"I stumbled upon this CD by chance and bought it without knowing anything more than I like every other Medicine CD. Before I listened to it, I read several reviews and was prepared to hate it. I put the CD aside and gave it some time to ""mature"" (i.e. disabuse myself from any other conceptions of what it was like). I was prepared for disappointment. However, I must say that the CD is very good. It is not exactly like every other Medicine CD, for sure. But who wants that? Brad Laner has ventured some, but he remains true to the sound experiments that Medicine embarked upon originally.Fans of My Bloody Valentine, Yo La Tengo, The Swirlies, and The Lilys will definitely like this CD. Just go into it forgetting it is supposed to sound a certain way (which is good advice in general)."
2,Not so good,"I love Cat Power, but this CD/DVD is a real disappointment. The music is okay, but the video is awful. The whole ""Chan in nature"" thing falls flat. It looks like they filmed it in the parking lot of a city park. Probably the worst are the three ""music videos."" If Mark Borthwick is an artist I'm sure he'll be a starving one. His filmmaking style is sadly lacking. Anybody, and I mean anybody, with a video camera could come up with something more compelling than this drivel.Two stars because the music is marginally enjoyable. 0 stars for the video. Blech."
1,What could have been...,"In principle, the idea behind this video actually intrigued me; it's in the execution where it falls short. The thing that bothered me most: the crickets (background noise) and wind were often louder than Chan. While perhaps that might have been the intention to let some of nature's elements play a part, it doesn't work, as it washes Chan out too much. Chan is also shot at quite a distance, and even on my 36"" tv, you can barely make her out. Again, I'm sure it is as intended, but it doesn't work well.Haven't heard the CD yet, but most folks will be buying this for the DVD."
2,Angry Nap Time,"This DVD was extremely frustrating. It totally sucks. I got it thinking it would be really beautiful, but it looks like a home video, and Chan is standing a mile away from the camera. I would have found it alot more enjoyable if it was just a CD. That would be nice. But this DVD is not even worth your time."
1,Good review by Lawrence!,"One star because I'll probably only watch it once. And, I only made it through that time because it was playing on my computer, and I was doing other stuff while it was on.It is an interesting idea - but it is only one idea, stretched over two hours.It's still nice to hear the music. At least, you can hear most of the music. The microphone seems to pick up the insects as much as Chan's voice."
1,Not even a YouTube video...,"I love Cat Power, I truly do, but this DVD will really leave you wanting. Not for the lack of musical talent on display, but it is an experimental film in which nothing really happens. The sound and picture quality are perfectly acceptable - there is just so little going on, certainly not enough to hold a viewer's interest for the length of the film. Maybe when Cat Power releases another record and goes on tour, we could get an actual live tour performance on video. That would be interesting, and Chan Marshall remains a phenomenal talent. Frankly, I am quite surprised that a substantial record label like Matador would release such an inconsequential work of art. I normally look to the Matador symbol as a mark of quality, but this was a letdown."
1,wow,"Just heard ""Boycott"" on Live 365 Power Pop Radio. Wow. I don't know if they're better than that song, but Jebus, that song is bad. It took a few years offa my life expectancy.Just.... bad."
4,Ah! Hot!,"Soulstice has been rocking my world VERY recently. I just got into them and heard this remix album, LORD it is soooo tight. Every song on here bumps, and almost every single track has refreshing, very NEW ideas. The production is sooooo amazing. Wow. JEEPERS!I flip out so much because of the garage-2step stuff goin on in Lockdown, that first track, which as far as I can tell is NOT a remix, just a little gift that Soulstice threw in because they are so nice. A couple of the other later tracks we've got crazy syncopation in the rhythm, which is what I'm all about at this point in time. And as far as hiphop goes, anything with dj spinna on it gets me going crazy.Get the original too just to understand the beauty of Soulstice, plus their respective remixers."
4,Ambitious Ambience Album,"This is definitely a very interesting album. Whoever likes Sade will like the singer's warm alto tone. It's a great CD for creating atmosphere in the evening.However, for my taste the production is slightly over-ambitious, especially towards the end where too many ideas have been stuffed into one song. I think a versatile and experienced producer could have helped with trimming the album down to it's essence - and could have then created another album with the edits...On the whole, if you like electronica - absoluety worth purchasing."
4,Oooh yeah!,"I remember desperately trying to rip the packaging off this cd after waiting outside of Tower Records @ midnight. I ran to my car, popped it in my discman, pushed play, and glanced at the cd cover. The 1st and only new track, Lockdown, definitely satisfied the need to hear something fresh from this very talented group. The remixes are great, I especially loved the J Boogie mix of Illusion. Best of all, like the original cd-Illusion, it didn't stick to one genre. If you've bought Illusion this is a must have."
3,pros and cons,"I tested the filter with a Canon 40D on a tripod. The photos came out looking like they were shot through a diffusion filter, in soft focus. On one hand, you get an added feature. But then again, it defeats the purpose of putting plastic in front of expensive glass."
3,Archos Docking Adaptor Kit,"Does what it is supposed to do. Very helpful to have a way to charge my Archos 604 without connecting to the computer. However, there are several of these listed on E-bay and could have gotten much cheaper!"
4,"A reasonably priced, good adapter for the Archos 404","Its small, portable, and allows you to easily connect your digital camera to the Archos 404, and charge it directly from the wall."
2,"not really needed, more stuff to lug around","We just bought a 504 and decided to splurge on the accessories. In hind site the only things we needed were the original unit, which comes with a perfectly acceptable USB charger, and the DOC since we wanted to hook it up to our HDTV and the DOC has both a remote and component/5.1 out. Turns out we could have scrimped a bit more and just stuck with the original charger, but we also got the docking adapter which really only adds another power supply to lug around (you can easily charge the 504 from any computer). Same goes for the CODECS, but that is another story.It works but sits on the shelf as an orphan now, when we travel we only take the original USB cable, the AV output cable, and the travel case"
4,"Works, but still charges slowly","This is handy to have at home as it allows me to keep the USB charger/docking cable that came with the archos 604 in my laptop bag for charging while I travel. I bought this kit mainly because they state that the charging time is significantly decreased. Sadly, I haven't seen much of a difference. It still takes 3+ hours to charge a fully depleted battery. There also isn't a stand, so you still end up laying the charge and unit on its side. So, overall it works and I would buy it again, but don't expect it to be a quickcharger or anything. You'll only see a small difference in overall charge time. If you travel frequently though, it's nice not to have to worry about forgetting the USB cable at home and leaving it in your laptop bag."
3,Nice accessory for Archos 504,"You need this docking kit if you want to use your 504 as a external harddrive, becuase it has the usb plugin, so you can save photos/files/music/pdf from your camera, jump drive, card reader, or computer. Why the 504 don't have usb or firewire on it? That's because they want to make 504 as slim as possbile. You just need to plug it into your 504 when you need it, I think this is a good feature. Besides, you need this adapter to quick charge your 504. Way faster than using the usb to charge the battery."
5,A must read for those interested in race relations history,Well written and a tragic telling of another one of America's disturbing chapters in race relations. Highly recommended.
4,A nice blast from the past,"I remember the Four Preps when they were on The Ozzie & Harriet Show back in the '60s. Not only did they sing, but they also starred as Rick's fraternity brothers! This CD is a really nice flash back to those happy days. One or two tracks are a tad too ""Lawrence Welk-y"", but it's easy to gloss over them in favor of the really nice, nostalgiac tracks found here. I would very much recommend this CD for those who remember those days and wish for simpler times again."
4,CD Purchase,I am absolutely rapt with the service from Amazon. As a first time buyer I was surprised and impressed by the speed which the item was sent and received. Definitely recommend Amazon and will purchase again in the future. This is an old favourite album so was great to receive it as new and in perfect condition.
5,Sweet and Simple,These are the best thing I've found to wall mount my pots. I have several 4 and 6 inch mixed together on the wall outised my front door.
2,Not good quality,These looked great from the pictures but the quality of the product was not great. I thought they would be some sort of black cast iron but when i received them they were really a cheap metal spray painted black which chipped off during shipping. Since I didnt have time to return them I used a black sharpie to fill in the chips. I wouldnt recommend.
4,Good Stuff,I took it and it helped me out well. I gave to my mom and it also helped her out a lot. It helped me balance my energy. It helped my mom with stomach acid. It also the real product and not fake like many of the other coral calcium products out there that are claiming to be Bob's creations.
4,Seems to work as advertised,"I ordered this product to help my wife combat her restless leg syndrome. She has used one 90 count bottle so far. While I know there is tremendous controversy surrounding Bob Barefoot's claims about this product, when my wife uses it her restless leg syndrome does not bother her. If she misses a dose, it flares back up. It remains to be seen what the long term effects will be but so far the short term effects have more than justified the price."
3,So far I can't tell any difference,"I went through a 30 day cycle with this product. To be honest, I don't feel any better or worse for the trial."
5,Pans,My mom & I bought this product as an X-Mas gift. They loved it. Shipped much faster than expected.
3,Not Chunks,"Although it is called ""Chunk White Albacore"", the can contains small shreds mixed with water. It is albacore, and the taste is fine, but ""chunks"" is just totally misleading. It's fine for mixing up for a tuna salad sandwich. They just should not label it as chunks."
1,Bumble Bee Chunk White Albacore in Water,I've been tricked into buying this when they have this crap on-sale (not Amazon). I think it's like the pink slime thing - all the shreds that are left-over from their more expensive products shred it and pack it like it really is chunk albacore.I hate the taste of this product. It's gross to me so I'll never buy it again. At least when I buy Chicken of the Sea Albacore Tuna in water - it is in chunks and I can use it as I want and actually tastes so much better.
4,A good reference for big projects,"Perhaps the first attempt to put a professional, repeatable engineering process onto UI Design for improved usability of systems and products. It is unique because it tries for the first time to integrate UI Design with established software development methodologies. This is comprehensive, very readable, and a highly usable book. GUI Design for the professional. Another must have book for the serious HCI people. Rather too many models and slightly too much of a grand design for the practical developer"
3,Okay if you like adventure,"This review is from my nephew: The story is weak, not enough character depth, but the story does stay focused and there are lots of episodes."
5,ok,"this is an ok anime series. For its price its worth it. I guess its best for those whom has played the game, so you can relate to somethings."
3,Joseph very well could be the first hebrew Pharaoh.,"The author has impressive credentials as an Egyptologist but lacks clarity as a writer. Joseph is in the right place to become Pharaoh, but Mr. Osman doesn't convince me as when this all takes place."
5,so satisfied,because this product works as it says and i am a great fan of Black Opal for my skin care needs:)
5,Really Works!!,"This is a good product for oily skin. This product cleared up my oils, and I really do not have any breakouts like I use to I highly recommend."
4,Great product and price,This product came right away and it was just what my skin needed and the price was great. I could have bought from local store but when ever I go in store looking for this product they are out.
4,Good Product,It came very quickly and was packaged extemely well. The only negative thing about it is that the center needs a little more stuffing but our dog loved it right away and sleeps on it nightly.
2,Too big,"These run too big in size and don't offer cushion on the back heal, which could cause painful blisters for your active toddler."
2,What a waste,"I am halfway through this book and contrary to the other reviewer I am having trouble NOT putting it down permanently.Molly Beaudreau seemingly has it all yet she literally kidnaps a baby, quits her medical profession on a moments notice and leaves town having little money to support her or this baby. One has to think that her instability doesn't bode well for her career as a physician! And then, with no direct reason, she becomes paranoid and fearful that someone is after her and the baby (that no one can know she has.)Talk about making judgements and leaping to conclusion. I am not impressed with molly. Our hero is likeable and has some really cute dialogue. I could grow to like him a lot but can't see the purpose. Oh well, its your call."
5,Excellent Disk,"This is a terrific disc, good recorded sound, nice instrument by Clementi's piano company, and interesting music also, which is seldom recorded.Amazon - please fix the description however, it is Clementi (Composer), John Khouri (Performer), not ""Busoni; Godowsky (Composer), Carlo Grante (Performer)""."
5,Keeps me going!,"This is one of the supplements suggested by one of my best friends and it really helps keep me going. As we get older, things don't work as they used to, so we have to find out what will get us back to our old selves and not feel bad about it!"
1,Did not work,From the reviews of this product I was expecting big things for my lower back pain. Did not work for me.
5,Nice,The book contains very pretty pictures and wordings. I bought for my boyfriend on anniversary and he really loves it
5,ADORABLE,"This book was so cute!!! I gave it to my boyfriend, but really I didn't want to give it away, even to him! I would defiantly reccomend it. Sweet, creative, overall a great gift."
1,"Whoever says this is a masterpiece, or 5 star album does not know anything about RHCP music","I was fortunate enough to listen to this album in it's entirety on VH1.com on Monday 5/8/06. After a couple of plays, I came to the conclusion that I would do myself a favor and save the twelve bucks that I would have dropped at Best Buy to buy this the next day. This is without a doubt the boringest, dullest, and just down right dreadful music the RHCPs have ever released. Dani California is an awesome track, however it's a yawn-fest the next 27 tracks. It's like listening to Porcelin (from Californication) style tracks the next 2 hours. You will regret buying this if you are expecting the RHCP to rock, they have just sunk way down into the mellow out mode, with Anthony Keidis just Crooning his way through 27 songs Clay Aiken style.How can you rate this 5 stars along the lines of Blood Sugar Sex Magik? Buyer and fan beware."
5,Best thing since tube socks,"If you haven't purchased this CD yet, run, not walk to purchase it!!! What band could put out a CD with so many songs & hit a home run on every song. Chili Peppers are so diversified & capable of some of the best music in the industry!"
5,SA Is really good.,"As a bass player Flea is my idol, as an avid behind the steering wheel and in the shower vocalist I just dig these soulfull lyrics and tones. been a RHCP fan since the mid 90's good on amazon to offer this as I have misplaced my original album. This is a very good sample of what the RHCP are all about and the download version is great!! Top quality audio."
4,If your a fan worth the Money,"If your a fan, worth the money. I bought it on a whim and was not disappointed. Its a definite change over what I have the option of listening to on the radio in this city I live in."
5,NEVER Disappointed!,The Chili Peppers are definitely on top of their game on this CD. Blood Sugar Sex Magic is the only other CD that even comes close to this one. I highly recommend it! I also loved the rare ART Box and all the cool stuff inside. A bit pricey but definitely worth it. Delivery was very fast.
4,"Once a Pepper, always a Pepper","If you like the Chili Peppers, you'll like this album. The Peppers have a very distinct sound (some of my friends argue that all their songs sound alike), and this album is no different. I'm a big Peppers fan, and have really enjoyed this album...but if you're not a fan, and you want something that sounds different than their previous albums, you shouldn't buy this one."
4,One awesome cd,"It never ceases to amaze me how a band of RHCP's stature can still be getting new fans all the time and they have been out for over 20 years! I became a fan of the group when i began listening to "" dani california"". I thought the song was awesome, so i asked for "" Stadium Arcadium"" for my birthday. Overall, the album is pretty good. There are maybe a few songs that really didn't grab my attention at first but they have grown on me. This is defintely a cd worth getting. There are 28 songs so chances are that you'll like a few of them even if you don't like them all."
3,"Dosent ""Blow Your Socks Off""","This new double cd from the peppers is just ok...it isnt great but it isnt bad. there are some good songs and there are some crappy ones. To me ""By The Way"" is above and beyond better than this collection of tunes.........pick up PEARL JAMthats an album!!!!!!!!"
1,What happened?,"This album was a huge disappointment. The Chili Peppers had become more pop a little less funk in Californication and then when by the way came out it was very popish but this cd, Stadium Arcadium is like they were trying to do some good pop and trying to do some good funk to be a mixture of One Hot Minute and By the Way and what came out was bad lyrics, horrible (if any) rhythm and just an album I only bought because I am a fan and I THOUGHT it would be worth it. It isnt. Save your money. This is the only RHCP album I have ever disliked and it is a pity. You will gain nothing by listening to this album and it was supposed to ""knock my socks off."" As anticipated as this album was, the Chili Peppers certaintly messed up."
2,Boring,It seems that the less drugs they take their music is badder. I like dani california and thats about it. Rest of the stuff not memorable. Songs are really boring. You can say what you want about fantastic melodys but the fact is that i havent remembered a tune from any song on the cds except from dani which also may be a result from too much playing on music stations.
5,AWESOME!!! One of the GREATEST Albums ever made!!!,"I've never been an avid listener of past Red Hot Chilli Peppers' songs or albums, but let me tell you somethin'...After listenin' to this AWESOME Double CD Album, I AM ONE NOW!!! This is ONE of the GREATEST ALBUMS ever made in the history of music...I rate this together with Jimi Hendrix's EXPERIENCE, U2's ACHTUNG BABY - JOSHUA TREE - HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB, and THE BEATLES' WHITE ALBUM - LET IT BE... All the songs, I repeat, ALL THE SONGS are GREAT, HEAVY, DYNAMIC, CATCHY and WELL WRITTEN/COMPOSED... PLUS the BASS Lines, GUITAR Riffs & DRUM Beat are OUT OF THIS F*CKIN' WORLD...YEEAAAHHHHH!!!!GOD BLESS the RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS!!!! I predict STADIUM ARCADIUM, will win GRAMMY ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!"
3,"Missing the ""Red Hot""","If this is their new direction, maybe they should change their name to the Mild Chili Peppers or Sweet Chili Peppers. Definitely NOT Red Hot.While I am thrilled they made a double album, and are releasing new music, where are the all fearless jams? The in-your-face rockers? This high dose of safe, mid-tempo, non-offensive music that even soccer moms hum to is tolerable in small chunks, such as By The Way album, but over the course of a double disc it's just too much to bear.There aren't any bad tracks here, but there aren't too many ""classics"" either. I've only transferred 13 tracks onto my ipod, whereas I have all tracks from their other albums (91-02) on there.And Anthony Kiedis calling this album the RHCP's ""greatest thing they've ever done"" is a bit of a stretch and really more for the hype/sales machine than a true coronation of this album.Someone needs to give these guys some coffee or Red Bull to WAKE THEM UP!"
3,Are the Red Hot Chili Peppers really what everyone thinks?,"If you really love the Red Hot Chili Peppers go ahead and buy the cd, but if your looking for a veriety of sounds don't buy it. Someone can just download one of thier songs from itunes and not have to listen to any other song becuase they all sound the same (few exeptions here and there).The main point is:Buy the cd if you absoultly love themandif your looking for verity don't buy it. or just download one song, this will save you some money"
4,BACK AGAIN,"Speaking from the mouths of all Chili fans. This album is diverse in the idea that tracks are all unique, some more vocal and acoustic than others. We do not omit Flea's sick bass style playing. Although this album focuses its attention on Anthony's vocals more so than it does the musical efforts. A good double album, and worth the wait, thanks for the birthday gift guys!"
3,How can people do this?,"I will start this off by saying that I haven't listened to the entire album yet. This is more of a review of some reviewers that artificially inflate the ratings.How can people sit on amazon and give every track a score between 9 and 10? Realistically, is it possible for this (or any) album to be that good? I like the RHCP, but I don't know why some people think that anyone can take their review seriously if the entire album is rated so highly (every track). Maybe an album is generally considered one of the best in history, but I know many would not like every track so much that they would give it 9 and above throughout.Even though I haven't listened to the entire album, I gave it 3 stars since I had to give it a score."
5,28 songs? why so few??,"I absolutely loved the last album, By the Way, and never thought I would ever listen to a better album, but Stadium Arcadium certainly is. It's just fantastic!! It was so much better and diverse than I expected it to be. I love every song in it and I don't care how long it is. I don't get tired while listening to it. It's beautiful and fulfilling music. It made me very happy to buy it and I beleieve it can also make you happy, if you take the time to appreciate this wonderful work of art."
4,"Love the mellow songs, forget about the over the top funk","This CD is split into 2 clear styles, mellow alt-rock that we have heard from these guys recently like their stuff from Californiacation, and then there is like straight up rock-funk like songs ""Give it Away"" and ""Suck My Kiss.""The funk songs just arent for me, they are over the top and embaressing to listen to. However the mellow rockers on this CD are all amazing songs. Overall I like about 14 our of the 28 songs, which still is alot, I basically just like the alternative rock songs and one funkish song (Tell Me Baby). The great songs are:Dani CaliforniaSnow (Hey Oh) <----- Amazing guitar and verseStadium Arcadium <----- reminds me of the song CaliforniacationSlow CheetahStrip My MindEspecially in MichiganWet Sand <----- the end of this song is AMAZINGDesecration SmileTell me BabyHard to Concentrate21st CenturyShe Looks to MeMake you Feel Better <------- gets me in a good good every timeDeath of a Martian"
2,Waste of time---their time is OVER!!! Maybe 10 songs stand alone!,"AwwWWWW EEWWWW, another DOUBLE ALBUM---one side HARD, the other SOFT>? or kinda soft...leftovers from BY THE WAY?? They should have released this as a single album...with 14 tracks....the previous reviewers have it right about the songs they think are the best...I just will go listen to CALIFORNICATION and Mother's Milk....By the way, no pun intended...THEY ROCK AS A LIVE BAND so check them out!!!!!!! PEACE OUT!"
1,RHCP fans everywhere are insulted!!,"In the time it's taken for the Chili Peppers to release thier last two albums they've turned from one of the best bands of the past 20 years to a mass produced teen pop band! Anthony Kiedis sounds like he should be singing in an emo band and Flea's bass lines have about as much balls as the last James Taylor album (don't get me wrong, I love James Taylor). Also, a double album? There arn't enough quality songs on this record to make a single album! Now, for those people that say artist's music changes over time, you're right and a lot of the time it's a welcome change, but their music should evolve and become even greater than it was, not something that sounds like it's made for teenie boppers.Flea was quoted saying ""If you don't like this album, you don't like the Chili Peppers."" Well I loved the Chili Peppers and ""Heyyooo this is what I sayyooo, THIS ALBUM SUCKS MY KISS!!!!"" Stick with the first 7 albums!"
2,dissappointment,"For all of you who were looking forward to a chili peppers album that goes back to their funky roots like Mother's Milk and such older albums, prepare for dissappointment because the new cd is mostly slow, generic, pop-rock, failing to bring out the musical talent that the band actually has. Simple beats by Chad Smith and basslines using root notes for one of the best bassists isn't cutting it....this album deserves a two at the highest"
1,not the same chilis' anymore! age ? NO . $$ ? YES!!!!!!,"bottom line is the chili peppers have either sold out or are too old and are a different place in their lives. i'm guessing the prior. with the cross over multi platinum success of "" under the bridge "" (great song and a great disc ) it seems all they are seeing is $$$$$$$$ signs. sooner or later money gets the best of most people, ""so lets just write under the bridge over and over""!! now grandpa and grandma as well as "" soccer moms "" all over the world can enjoy listening to newer peppers discs or hearing them on their favorite easy listening radio station. too bad, i use to really like these guys"
1,Ewwww,"This was one of the most boring albums I've ever listened to, if not THE most boring. All the songs were so dry, weak, tame and bland that I felt like jumping off a cliff about half way through. It was extremely mediocre with almost nothing redeeming about it, except for the song Dani California, which was actually pretty good. Sorry if I offended anyone, but really, if I had to listen to it again I would probably die of boredom."
1,Smoked too much.....,"I am not sure about this one. Mostly winey and bizarre. Pay no reference to it's package design and title, the music within is more like it came from the backwoods. Perhaps someone didn't ask them how often you find barbarous hicks in the space arcade? Remindes me more of someone removing themselves to roam the wilderness...."
1,"Boring, drab, dreary, dry, dull, flat,.....disappointing","Nothing caught my attention on this album...Even Dani Cal is just OK. The Peppers mellowed some in their previous album (which still sounded great!), but this one takes it to the nth degree and is a complete sleepfest. They've lost that edge.I really regret not previewing it first (something I never had to do with their previous albums).I should have realized the songs they were going to be making when they added those two extras in their 'Greatest Hits' (Fortune Faded, Save the Population) which bombed."
1,Who care about California?,"Yes they are from California, yes Californians like their home state. Yes I am sick and tired about hearing about California and I would love for the Chili Peppers to release an album without a song about California because despite every Californian's beliefs most things that come from California arent very good. Inlcuding this album."
1,about 20 songs too long,"the Red Hot Chili Peppers had a moment in the early 90's where they connected with a Hybrid of Pop,Elements of Funk&Hip-Hop flavoring that made them cool for a minute.but they ain't been able to go beyond cliches since about 92/93&have been playing it safe&just repeating the same grooves,&the Production been the same over the past decade. nothing really stands out here. if this were a 8 song single album i might say average&even then that might be too much."
1,"They won't be playing ""STADIUMS"" anytime soon","Horrible. There is no better word to describe this over-hyped nonsense. What happened to these guys? 2 discs? They must be kidding. This is an EP at best. They have lost their ""stones"" completely. They should take the socks off their d*@ks and put them over their other head. It sucks!"
1,RHCP?,"Absolute waste of money! Hillel is spinning in his grave! Anthony needs to stop trying to sing and get back to the funk/rap that made the peppers. I'm not sure if it is their age or lack of drugs, but they should just hang it up."
2,28 original Tracks? i think not,"heres the deal, deal or no deal! well im not pushing the button! RHCP have been my favorite band for a while. They have a lot of talent but they aren't taking many risks. the entire album could have been predicted by a baby knowing that the angry old man was going to take his candy!While most of the tracks are uninteresting I especially like Johns solos. Its too bad he relies on tired four chord progressions. The harmonies are great as well but kiedis kinda sucks (lyrically and sometimes vocally)...i tried being in a band who idealized kiedis and he never sang on pitch.Dani California is pretty good for a pop song but we're all gonna pay for it when thats the only song in our heads for the rest of the summer.Listening to this album, I learned that they're a great ballad band. I guess whatever it means to you, good for it. I do like ""Hey"" and ""Strip my Mind"""
1,stupidity at its best,"A 4 year hiatus? They should have just stayed gone. Another band that cant sing, or play. Just trying the easy way to get you to give them money, after all, there are over one hundred used for sale already. That should say something about how bad this garbage is"
1,Worst Album,"Everything up to and including Blood Sugar Sex Magik are great. One Hot Minute had its moments, but Calfornication was bad, By The Way was worse, and Stadium Arcadium is just plain Garbage. Save your money."
5,Rock On!!!!!!,This cd is one of the best one I've heard from Red Hot Chili PeppersI love it and I suggest everyone listens to it the stadium arcadium rocks
5,Amazing Album,Probably the most listened to album of all musical albums on my iPod. SOOOO many songs and all of them are just awesome. I don't think you will see an output of such quantity and quality from another musical act in a long time.
5,Faith in Youth Restored,"I'm a 50-year-old man who still thinks the music made by bands such as MC5, Stooges, Trooper, Montrose, Humble Pie, Mandrill, Brick, Kleeer, and Lakeside will never be topped as far as hard rock and punk funk goes, and I received this album as a Xmas gift from my 23-year-old daughter, who still thinks she can teach an old dog some new tricks. I have no interest in inserting myself into the raging debate about whether this album represents a return, a departure, or a further slide for the RHCP. I'm only here to say one thing: ""She's Only 18"" is the best song I've heard in a long, long time. It's playful, raunchy, rockin', euphoric, and big-hearted all at once. The slinky little eye-fluttery wawaaing guitar riff mirroring the vocals on the verses shows perfect restraint, setting up the power chords of the chorus. Brilliant."
3,Pink Warm Cherry Tomatoes,"The Chili's continued to refine and repeat their accessibility factor by further streamlining once jagged and combative elements into a less resonant, though wider-appealing approach, to their credit still offering a very solid two-disc compromise."
5,Solid Chili Peppers,"If you love the Chili Peppers, this Special Edition album is a must have. There are video interviews, knick-knacks, and one of the greatest recordings from the band all wrapped in one neat little package."
5,Makes any day freaknfantastic,"I have purchased 3 copies of this double disk. Love, Love LOve the Chili Peppers. Any difficult day can be made better by sliding in a RHCP disk and this one is amazing. Every ordinary day becomes extraordinary with the RHCP. They get me through the rough times and elevate the good times.Makes me smile.Since I own all that is RHCP and am of similar age, I can tell you that this is different from early stuff... just a little. But life is a voyage and who wants to travel in circles revisiting the same ol'same ol'."
5,Fabulous,Great album. I have listened to it often since I bought it a month ago. Each time I play it I like it better and better. Good for listening to every word or for playing in the background.
3,Decent. The Chilis Lost Their Edge Though,"ever since Blood Sugar Sex Magik the chilis lost the edge they once had in my opinion. i realize the boys are off drugs, but they must have relapsed when they decided to make this bad boy a double album. def too much filler. they should have released a cd that looked something like this:dani californiacharliestadium arcadiumtorture meespecially in michiganwarlockscmon girlwet sandtell me babyhard to concentrateanimal barnow wouldn't that make the album much more impressive? yes, i think so.some of the songs on that list are friggen good with alot of awesome playing between frusciante and flea.they are still after 20 years one of the best bands around, their live act is sick as it always has been, and they still have a couple good albums left in them, just don't expect to be blown away by this one. rock on"
5,Fantastic,"This album is extremely diverse, fun to listen to, and sonically impressive. I'm not sure what more you can ask for.This is one band that has NOT lost even an ounce of enthusiasm for what they do, and it shows!"
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I got turned on to the Peppers in '92 when I was in the tenth grade. BSSM was in my rotation for a few years! However, as of late I had not listen to much of their music. Then I went out and bought this latest record.Man! It gave me that feeling all over again! The Peppers are a great band and this is a great album. Just put it on and let it play. Stadium Arcadium will not disappoint!"
5,Excellent Album,"In recent memory, very rarely does an album come out that works well as both an album and as a set of seperate songs by themselves. This is one such album. Whether you are listening to the whole thing as if reading a book or picking and choosing songs, you will get an incredible experience. Great album by RHCP."
4,"Stadium Arcadium...strange title, good CD","Actually, I'd give this CD 4.5 stars. I don't consider myself a diehard Chili Peppers fan. The only other Peppers CD I own is their greatest hits (purists disdain most ""hits"" compilations). Forgive me, but some of their hip hop music is hard for us ancient ones to handle in large doses. But much of their music appeals to a broad spectrum of music afficionados. They are one of the few contemporary groups that my friend's teenage sons and I agree on...and I'm pushing 60.I'd read other reviews that touted Stadium Arcadium as one of their best. I'd add my name to that list. There's not a stinker in the bunch...and this is a 2-CD set. I'm not sure the teenagers would agree."
5,Problems w/ the Mars Disk,After reading another review I guess that I was not the only one having problems with the mars disk. it played in my car and in my cd player but i could not get it to play in my computer. i did exchange it for another copy and it works fine now.
2,Today I am sad.,"I just heard this album won ""best rock album"" at the grammys. This record is at best the red hot chili peppers fourth best CD, and that is extremely being generous. How can an album with the same thing we've heard before, just in double LP format this time, win album of the year? Don't get me wrong, I love rhcp as much as the next Californian, but it's not THAT good. Please!I encourage you to purchase Muse - Black Holes and Revelations instead of this CD. For it should have been the album of the year."
2,"Im sorry, but VERY disappointing.","ok, i love the chili peppers. Blood Sugar Sex Magic and Californiacation are two of the greatest albums ever recorded so i am a big fan but i have been alittle disappointed in their direction. By the way was a horrible cd and too radio friendly. So when i heard this album was coming out and i heard it was more of their old sound i was very excited and it was a double cd....two helpings of RHCP, AWESOME!But you know what? this album sucks too, very bland sounding, very boring sounding and too poppy sounding. The chili peppers are a great band but they are going downhill fast. They wanna be liked by everyone and they wanna be played on the radio.listen to it before you buy it....i persoinally cant see how people are giving this album 4-5 stars. theres a few good songs on this album but 95% of it is boring."
2,Rip off of Tom Petty,"No doubt Tom Petty will be sueing over copyright infringement of his song, but I'll give the RHCP credit: they did a great job of ripping him off. That's why I upped it from one to two stars. Also, why do so many of their songs have to do with California? Been there, done that. There are 49 other states to choose from."
3,The Yellow Mild Banana Peppers,"I Love the Red Hot Chili Peppers! BUT... (oh, here we go...) this is not the Peppers I fell in love with in 1987 when I saw them at a local club, nor the fiery peppers from the Californication era. I've listened to both discs several times and the songs do grow on you and it is a decent album, but I am longing for the Pep in the peppers. There is no spark. I understand that bands ""grow"" and their sounds change. For most, it is a great thing. I probably wouldn't be a big Beatles, Rush, and Dream Theater fan if their sound stayed stagnant, but something about this album that just isn't there FOR ME. I liked the early RHCP sound and am yearning to hear more of it. A couple of years from now when I go to my CD collection to grab some RHCPs to listen to, this one will probably stay on the shelf."
5,Unbelieveable,"Jesus tap-dancing Christ I am in complete shock and awe when it comes to Stadium Arcadium. This is absolutely rediculous.... to have four people come together to create these 28 hits is unheard of. Both albums are amazing all the way through. Each song is perfect in its own right. Anyone calling ""Hey"" (track 14 on Jupiter) filler, is absolutely out of their mind. This is the greatest makeout song ever written! Plus, John's solo at the end has the most pure heart and soul that I have heard come from a guitar in a VERY long time."
5,A work of art,"I am a long time fan of the chili peppers but I don't think that biases my review of this product.Stadium arcadium runs the musical spectrum and is one of the deepest albums in the last 30 years. There is plenty of funk for the old school fans but also a fusion of melody that was lacking in many of the blood sugar sex magic tracks. The title track, stadium arcadium, is so beautiful that it could have walked off of Pink Floyd's ""Dark side of the moon."" Other tracks, my personal favorites ""torture me"" and ""hard to concentrate"" display a range and depth far beyond most bands. I challenge anyone to play both CDs through and not lose themselves in the music. Arcadium is a testament to the RHCP's ability to continually create excellent music and it may be there best effort to date!"
1,"Great album, sounds absolutely awful","This is one of the worst mastering jobs I've ever heard (and lately I've been hearing a lot of really bad ones). Whoever did this (or forced the engineers to do this) does not deserve to be involved in the music industry and owes a huge apology to all the fans. It's really sad to think that so many music fans are being deprived of hearing the music they like with the sound as it emerged from the instruments, rather than some stupid digital compression machine that belongs in a radio station, not a recording studio.Try to find the vinyl version of this album and listen to it side-by-side with the awful CD version. It will really open your ears as to what this music is supposed to sound like."
2,Pass This One Up,"There's only a few songs worth hearing on this album, the highlight being Wet Sand, but other than that, just wait and hope that the Chili Peppers deliver better next time.This album is not worth the money; it is a terrible album, and if you're new to Chili Peppers and have heard Dani California on the radio, get Californification instead. That album is what they are all about."
4,Not too funky,"This album is more pop/rock than a lot of their earlier funk sounding albums. I found that most of the track grew on me quite fast, and none were so strange to be almost unbearable to listen to like I found with many of their past albums. Well worth the money if you enjoy mild pop/rock or enjoyed any of the other lighter RHCP songs."
5,Chilis at their BEST!,"I love, LOVe, LOVE this CD. This CD is a bargain for the awesome music you get! The Red Hot Chilis are at their best!"
2,Not up to snuff--Peppers continue their downward trend.,"I became a fan of the Peppers when their first album was released. Having grown up in LA, Ive probably been to 30 of their shows. They were different and fresh and their distinctive sound was driven by Flea's driving bass and Anthony's sing song rapping.Well excepting a handful of songs on the two album disk, thats not who they are any more. Anthony is just a singer (and not an especially talented one) and Flea's bass is largely just another instrument in a solid but unexciting quartet. They are a solid rock group that stil has some of their original influences, but I have hundrds of CD's, I dont listen to them to hear a solid rock group. I listen to them to get up and jump.Flea, recently told a reporter that ""If you don't like this album, you don't like the Peppers"". Alas he may be right. I wont buy the next one."
3,way overrated,"i bought this album around the time it came out. they are a very talented band, but the songs are just not rememberable. the new single snow is more annoying than groovy. i hold rhcp high because of their past successes. fact is, if this was their only album they would be just like every other band out right now. that goes against everything they were. i know bands evolve. but they should evolve like every other good band did and come out with unheard music. they are following aerosmith's footsteps and writing filler music and capitalizing. i know they have to eat and they love to tour. so i can't knock them for putting out an album that keeps them out there. but for people to say that this album is anything close to being legendary or ground breaking is ridiculous. sorry, it's just not that good"
3,Exile on Sane Street,"There is a thin line between madness and genius. While they walked this line (or were close enough in years to channel it) RHCP produced songs of genius. Reading Anthony Kiedis' bio Scar Tissue shows how the madness of sex, drugs and rock and roll led to such masterpieces as Under the Bridge (note how its chorus echoes the Stones' Can't always Get What You Want).Now, also echoing the Stones, RHCP has produced its Exile on Main Street - to some it's greatest, to others OK, - a great band as a bar band. To me, it is extremely hard to imagine anyone playing any of these tunes 100 years after they were written, as will be the case of great rock songs.I think RCHP are nice middle aged men who happen to be rock stars. That's what this music sounds like. They no longer walk that line between madness and genius. They are Exiles on Sane Street."
4,Excellant CD!,Double album with all fantastic songs...no filler. I would strongly suggest buying it.
5,Awesome,"Incredible. I have been a casual RHCP fan for years. With this CD, I am now a full fledged fan."
5,Does it get any better than this?,"This is a double CD and I love/like most of the songs. I can't recall this ever happening and I grew up in the 70's so I have years to work with. It's just fabulous and I hoping the fab four will keep up the great work. John F just shines here, but then again he always has. I should not have to have my Rolling Stone magazine upside down. He should have been front and center..Oops I am getting off track. Death of a Martain, Storm in a Teacup, Strip My Mind and Make You Feel Better are favorites. Also purchase B side I'll be Your Domino from I-tunes (I love it)...I don't know why this is not included on the album, but I am glad it is on my Ipod."
3,NOT FOR GENUINE FANS,"I rarelly listen to rock music, so i liked this ""mainstream"" album. Most people will like its catchy choruses and great sound. It's an ""easier"" album, considering the band's previous releases, but the genuine and hardcore fans will certainly be dissapointed with this ""cosmetic"" album."
5,getting your moneys worth,"I'm not a die-hard fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and was a bit skeptical at first to buy a 2 disc cd set. I just had to have the song ""Snow"" and after listening to the music sampler I decided to give ""Stadium Arcadium"" a chance. Sure am glad I did!!! I'll listen to both cd's without skipping a song. I highly recommend adding this cd to your collection."
5,Mars!!!,The Mars disc is ridiculous! Every song is extremely catchy and a joy to listen to. The bass in 21st Century is amazing and the harmonies throughout the entire disc are awesome. I would say both discs sound like By The Way with cajones.
5,This is way better then the last one!!!!,I didn't know how this one was going to be because the last cd that RHCP put out there was like only one good song on the cd. So I was looking at tv at the song Dani California came on tv. I said to myself well if the rest of cd sounds like this one it will be way good. Sure enfo I picked it up today and played both of the cds the whole way throw and you know what I was right. If you like old RHCP then pick up this one you will not go wrong with this one!
1,Cotton Candy Pop Princesses,"I've loved the Chili Peppers ever since I was in 8th grade (I am now 29 years old), and it saddens me to say that this album was terrible. The last two albums (Californication; By the Way) since the return of John Frusciante have been beautiful, but I guess it now seems clear that they were building towards this cookie-cutter pop disaster. The Peppers seem to have left their integrity behind for this one, creating a radio-friendly collection without much merit. What's worse is that it's not only one, but two cd's of mind-numbing mediocrity. Save yourself some money and buy a Pearl Jam record."
2,"80 Percent Horrible, 10 Percent Decent, 10 Percent Good","Not much more to say besides what it says in my headline. 80% of the album is absolute garbage. B-Sides, at absolute best. I can't believe the Chili Peppers wasted their time putting out a double album, with 80% filler. What a joke!There are a few good songs: Dani California, Stadium Arcadium, Tell Me Baby. A few decent songs: Charlie, Snow (Hey Oh), and a couple of others. Then the rest is pure garbage. Filler, at absolute best. I can't even make it past most of the songs if I'm listening intently. If it's background noise, then I can make it through both albums in their entirety. Otherwise, no chance.The Chili Peppers downfall since Californication has been dramatic. I shudder to think what a follow up to this abomination will be."
5,"Better than BTW,Californacation,OHM and others.","This is probably as good as BSSM but in a differant sytle, Slow Cheetah is just an excellant song, and Wet Sand is brilliant especially the ending.Great songs on the 2 cds:Especially In Michigan, Wet Sand, Torture Me, Animal Bar, Readymade, Stadium Arcadium, Snow ((Hey Oh)), Hump de Bump, Charlie, Dani California, Desecration Smile, Tell Me Baby, Make You Feel Better, She Looks To Me, If, Turn It Again, Death Of A Martian, Slow Cheetah, She's Only 18, Strip My Mind, Hey.And the rest are good.Apart from Hard To Concentrate thats.... well thats quite boring.Overal a solid album which good match up on BSSM anyday."
3,Homogeneous Production Stifles Virtues,"The songs on this album are all 3.5 star songs. They're executed in a better-than-average fashion, and that's it. The production values don't merit much praise, since they strip the variety out of the album. Most tracks, despite having inventive application of standard instruments, see musical innovation stifled by a studio-imposed uniformity. ""Animal Bar"" is still the most original track in terms of its execution. Overall, though, since the whole albums sounds so much alike and drags on for so long, I still give it a collective 3 star rating."
3,Would Be Much Better As A Single Disc,"Stadium Arcadium is a solid cd,with a good blend of old school Peppers and new school Peppers.The biggest problem with it is the same problem that occurs on most 2cd sets and that is there are too many songs that just arent that good.If the Peppers had made this a single disc,it very well could have been their best since Blood Sugar.There are enough solid songs to make one pretty good disc.I love the fact that they brought back some of their old style to go along with their current sound.It makes for a all around listen which is nice.Highlights include ""Dani California"",""Charlie"",""Shes Only 18"",""Hard To Concentrate"",and ""If"".Songs such as ""We Believe"" and ""Especially In Michigan"" I could live without.All together though I put together an 18 track disc that is pretty solid,so that leaves about ten tracks on here that really dont need to be here.That is unless of course for some silly reason the artist feels the need to release a double disc."
4,Photoshop CS,It was just the right book to go with the program I have.I can now smoothly glide through the picture editing.
2,Heavy Reading,"I ordered this book because of the great reviews it was getting and hoped I would get some new and wonderful ideas for photo editing. There is no question that this is well written publication, but I found that it is probably more suited for the ""upper-intermediate"" and ""Advanced"" Photoshop user. The book itself deals with a lot with ""why things work the way they do"" as opposed to ""how to do it."" I know that I will need to read the book a couple of times to absorb all the information. I am definitely overwhelmed by the information."
5,Super speed,I use this card in my Sony Alpha 700. There is a huge difference in camera performance and in uploading to my computer using this card compared to slower speed cards. Your camera or device must be capable of using 300X or you won't get full benefit from this card. Check your device documentation before you spend the premium price for a 300X card.
3,Course book,"Bought this book as an alternative to getting the ridiculously expensive new edition. It is almost exaclty the same except for a few little chapter exerpts and special examples that I had to get from a friend's book, but other than that the vast majority of the problems and everything are identical. Some of them are numbered a little differently, like with the exercises switched places, but again, only a small percentage. The only thing I find annoying about this book is the few number of worked out examples. If you get this book, get the student manual that comes with it or that comes with the new version because I need a lot of examples to study off of and this did not cut it."
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"I saw Dana Fuchs this summer '11 in Seattle. By the end of the first song, the microphone stand had been kicked over and she was on the floor singing from her knees. Picture if Robert Plant and Janis Joplin had a baby. This is Dana. How she sustains her energy I do not know. The Live From NYC DVD effectively captures this. On stage she exuded honesty and sincerity - not posturing. We have bought copies of this to give to friends, and they are all blown away. I agree 100% with everything said in the ""Outstanding"" review from 10/12/11. After the concert, a friend said ""That is by far the best concert I have ever been to"". She is our #1 favorite artist, and my wife plays her CDs all the time. Like Amanda Marshall, her live music translates better than her studio recordings (which are still great - it is just that she sets the bar at an unbelievable height.) This is a Must See DVD."
5,"so hard aye, DOPE","hella hard, this dude's best work and check out DEEP ROOTED , his new group - new album out 2009"
1,Wrong information on the title,Although the title says Grand Prix Eurovision 2000 and should contain the songs from each country it doesn't. They are all songs from the German selection to find their song to represent them. With the exception of the last track which was the winner for 1999. Very misleading title. Be warned
5,12 points go to...,I'm sure that people who love the Eurovision song contest (like me! ) will adore this CD!It's wonderful how it can be good singers and musics in this contest! You must buy this CD!
5,Mother of 2,We keep this toy hung in our car above our 4 weeks old sons car seat and he loves looking at it and trys to grab it. It keeps him entertained during the drive since he doesn't like sleeping in the car. He loves the barking sound it makes. I would recommend this toy for little ones. You can tell that the colors stimulate him.
5,"5 stars for ""Big Red""","We call this dog ""Big Red"" and my 5 month old LOVES this toy. He will hold it up in the air and laugh at it and loves to play with ""Big Red""s crinkle ears. We can't go anywhere in the car without this toy. There is something about the way he feels and looks with the colors and the bells in his feet and hands and the crinkle ears that is just so fun to a baby. I highly recommend this dog. I happened to buy him for a lot more than this at an expensive baby botique but he was worth it."
3,not worth the money,"good qualities:- it is brightly colored,- each paw has a different sound/texture (rattle, crinkle, etc) -- when you press in the nose, the dog makes a barking noise that entertains babynot so good qualities:- most rattle type snap on toys have a ring on top that ""locks"" together so that you can snap the toy onto a toybar, stroller, etc. This toy has a ring on top but the ends don't snap together- it is surface washable only. you're not supposed to throw this in the washing machine (although some reviewers have indicated that it does wash ok)Is it cute? Definitely. Is it durable? Seems to be (we have only had it 4 months). Is it worth $12? No Way. These kinds of toys are everywhere. I found one in Carters for half the price that barks when you squeeze the paw, has the snap on ring AND when you pull the rope it hangs from the toy even vibrates - a much better deal.So, over all I would say, continue looking and you'll find a similar product at a better price."
2,Not right for my child,"I bought this toy because of the rave reviews, he was NEVER interested in it. But it seems that all of these other children like stuffed animals and my son couldn't care less about them. So if your child is like mine, don't bother."
4,Cute Friend for baby,"I bought this lil pup for my baby when he was 2 months old, now he is 8 months old and still loves him. His favorite is the doggy ears that make the crinkle sound and he loves to stick them in his mouth. It also has a cute little stretchy peice with a bone for them to chew on too. Each arm and leg make a cute little raddle or jingle noise. And by the press of his nose you hear a little bark(which would normally scare my baby) but he loves it. I recommend this toy for parents to buy b/c it is safe, cute, soft, does many things, and babies will enjoy this friend for awhile."
5,Pupsqueak is a must have!,This toy has it all. My daughter has loved this toy from the start. She is now 4 months of age and Pupsqueak goes everywhere with her. Her favorite part is the crinkly ears. The squeaker is great for distracting her when she is crying. And the bells in the feet are just now beginning to get her attention. I believe every child should have one of the Lamaze Learning Curve toys. I have read the reviews for the other toys and it appears that they are all as wonderful as this one.
3,broken bark!,"This toy is so cute and visually stimulating, my son loves to grab on and look at it. However, after only a week of owning it, the ""bark"" when you push the nose fizzled out. For $12 this toy should have outlasted the weeks worth of pushing from a 5 month old."
5,Adorable!! Great for the soon to be animal lovers!,"I purchased this toy for my god child. She was smitten!! But I think I played with it more!! All these adorable sounds, push the nose for a bark and crinkle ears! We both love it. It is a perfect fit for her too, she just turned a year old, when I read the previous reviews I was a little worried that it may be too young for her, but she is crazy about it, she carries it with her everywhere. I tell her to be nice to the doggie, and maybe it will even come in handy when she gets her own real dog!! Needless to say, it was hard for me to leave without it!!"
2,twist and lock fails to stay locked,"No matter how much I twist these to lock, 10-15 minutes into the trek one of the pole will give and it's suddenly shorter than the other. Kind of dangerous if you're relying them through challenging terrain. I figured I'd spend the extra money on MSR but I've found from experience, the push locking on other brands is way better than these unfortunately."
1,Not The Same Doll,I purchased this doll for two reasons - it supports breast cancer research and the doll was gorgeous with a very dark complexion. The doll I received did not have the striking appearance as shown online. She is a completely different doll that is rather generic looking and unfortunately it's going back.
3,A Decent Set,"This is Definately aimed at Jackie Chan fans, but not so much at those who are not. Master w/ Cracked Fingers is OK, but Jackie had done much better. FMF is also a fun movie, but only that. Neither are as exciting as some of his other films. For really good older Chan films, watch Young Master, Dragons Forever, Wheels on Meals, or Drunken Master. For the price, though, Jackie Chan fans will like this."
5,Box set nuff said,"Box set of this amazing series. Well maybe not amazing but still pretty good as far as a ""moe"" or ""harem"" type anime is concerned :)!?"
5,It's the best I've read so far!,"I received my Jump Into Janitorial book yesterday and just finished reading it! My wife, Pat, is now itching to get at it! Thanks so much! I like your style! Simple and straight forward!You have confirmed and reinforced for me many of the ideas I have been thinking about since we incorporated and started fulltime in January of 2004. Particularly, your ideas on niche job type, employee profile, overhead, quality of life, paying by the job (instead of hourly), $ per man hour, etc....I really enjoyed your chapter and thoughts on marketing.........Thanks again for doing the book. It's the best I've read so far! My sister lives in San Diego. Maybe we'll have the chance to meet someday!Sincerely,Eric DenglerLet It Shine, Inc.Fort Collins, CO 80525"
2,Needs a proper grind and an edge thinner than 2mm,"THe hatchet is constructed solidly, the angle of the bevel seems like it would be great for chopping efficiently, but on a plank of Alder, all this did out of the box was bounce off leaving a small ding. In comparison my other unknown brand hatchet would put a two inch deep cut in there. Its not a bad design, but just seems like something produced en masse and without care for an edge."
5,Great product!,"I love this hatchet! It makes short work of tree roots, and it's great for chopping firewood at the campsite."
2,Bad grind,"It seems that this brand has had a decline in quality in recent years. It arrived unsharpened, which was expected at this price point, but the grind was terrible. It was not even remotely even, and needed a good deal of time spent at the grinder to get it correct. Even though I took care to not ruin any temper the edge had, it still does not hold an edge well compared to other axes and hatchets. It gets a star for having a well-fitted head and haft, but overall I was quite disappointed."
5,Indoor use,I bought this to suspend a very large blown glass ornament in from of a window. Looks great–attractive and small enough to be unobtrusive.
2,Repetitive and over-hyped,"They say of Vivaldi that he didn't compose 600 concerti, he composed the same concerto 600 times. It seems that Bocelli sings the same song over and over and over and over . . . Moreover, while there were some subtitles when Bocelli said something, there were no subtitles during the songs, which were nearly all in Italian. Perhaps if I knew what he was singing about I would have enjoyed it more. It was also grotesque to describe him as the greatest singer in the world, no, in the universe, and the trumpet player he had on as the greatest trumpet player in the world - forget Domingo or Pavarotti (still alive when this performance took place) or Marsalis et al. Bocelli has a pleasant voice, no more, kind of an Italian Mario Lanza. Perhaps if he had sung familiar arias or songs (his Besame Mucho was in my opinion the best effort of the night), this might have been enjoyable, but as it was I was quite simply increasingly bored."
3,Misclassified,"This disc comes up when one searches ""classical music blu-ray"". However, it is not a classical music blu-ray disc. Rather, it fits into the ""Pop"" music category. As Mr. Bocelli is generally associated with classical music, potential buyers should be aware that no operatic arias are performed on this disc. I was expecting to find some, but I was disappointed with my purchase since I'm not really a pop music fan."
5,Vivere Live in Tuscany,"I'm a great fan of Andrea. This CD & DVD are one of the best. Unusual to hear him sing popular selections, but great. The accompanying orchestra, singers, & artists were overwhelming & didn't cover up Andrea's voice. Thank you Andrea Bocelli.Al WebsterSomerset, Wisconsin"
5,"This DVD/CD is a ""must have"" for any Andrea Bocelli fan",This is a lovely DVD. Bocelli and friends filmed on a balmy evening in Bocelli's home village in Tuscany at his Teatro del Silenzio. Be prepared to be engulfed by the music and the beauty of the scenery.
2,I got fooled again.,"Fool me once, shame on you.Fool me twice, shame on me.This time it's my fault.This is the second audio only so called BluRay disc that I've bought from Amazon, not realizing that they produced no video output.Amazon customer service was most courteous in refunding my first purchase.Amazon however has not yet indicated on their web pages that such discs are audio only prominently enough not to fool fools like me.My only excuse is that the music material is so very much to my liking that I ordered it too quickly.Hopefully, I won't do this a third time. Amazon could help more."
5,Highly recommended,"Excellent, the concert is great, the sale went very well, a very responsible seller, delivery was prompt. I'm very happy. Sorry for my English"
5,Just Buy It!,"I bought this after several of my friends recommended it. The setting, the music, the guests, perfecto. If you have a decent sound system, you will play this dvd daily and be enthralled each time."
2,fair,"vivere live in tuscany/ cd/dvd/the /cd/ has only eigth ricordings and not the entire program.the /dvd/will not play on some older /dvd/ player/ but will on newer one.It seems that that they are copys ,not the origenal."
3,DVD/CD inconsistency,The DVD was terrific. Unfortunately the CD was just a subset of theconcert selections on the DVD. Why?-- misleading.One of the missing is the terrific duet w/ Heather Headley-- Vivo per Lei which I would like to include in my music library but can't find anywhere
1,franco,"Amazon! You should have stated the dialog was in Italian! I owned A Night in Tuscany with English dialog, loaned and never returned.......The seller states it was your responsibility to post."
1,vivere live in tuscany (cd/dvd,I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY PURCHASE. i COULD NOT WATCH YOUR DVD ON MY WIDE SCREEN TV AS YOUR DVD IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MY DVD PLAYER. I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO WATCHING THIS WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS I HAD INVITED FOR DINNER AND COULD NOT WATCH IT.LILY
5,andrea bocelli in tuscany,I heard this recording before I bought it and it was so wonderful I had to add it to my recordings.Thank YOu
5,Must have!!!!,"This is the best andrea bocelli dvd, featuring many famous musicians. I enjoyed it very much!!!"
5,Fast and easy purchase. Saved a lot of money.,I purchased a CD named Vivere with Andrea Bocelli and other stars. It was in perfect condition and it was delivered in 24 hours. What a nice surprise. Thank you!
5,wonderful,"wonderful, this time excelled andrea bocelli, I have no words to describe, exciting, a program for all ages."
4,"In concert ""Tuscany""","This concert was amazing, what HIFI music not only that, but the people who has been invited to sing with Andrea was phenomenal.In my opinion any body should have this one in their collection.Eduardo."
5,perfect dvd,i loved the concert and so did all my friends. it is an amazing concert in Tuscany. loved it.
5,best one ever,heaven can wait i am in paradise the dvd is out standing in my own words this is his best
3,Solid,"I bought this book at a discount from a local retailer due to its age. After looking at some of Jakobs new material I was eager to get my hands of some of his previous work. Although I found this book useful, it was not as apporiate as some of his more recent work. Worthwhile all the same."
1,Disappointing,"I do usability inspections as part of my job. I bought this book based on Nielsen's reputation and the description of this book here on Amazon.com. I was very disappointed to find that this book was scholarly, not practical. After scanning the book, I returned it for refund."
2,"A Book of Research, not Ideas","This book is academic and a dry read. There are better books out there which address this same material that makes for an easier read. But if you want to read the original work that paved the road for those books and usability now, here it is. Academic research that is usability's foundation!"
1,USELESS,"This book should be entitled Oracle SQL Unleashed. It seems specifically geared toward Oracle, and it appears that Oracle has many extensions not found in Microsoft or Syabse (which use Transact-SQL). Therefore, you should purchase this book only if you use Oracle. Despite it being useless, I tried skimming through it, just in case something would actually work with MS or Sybase. I found the book poorly organized and poorly written. It was confusing, and I have never seen such poorly structured code samples."
5,Outstanding and practical guide. Many great examples.,"I have been using SQL Unleashed for over a year, and it is the book I consult first when I have a SQL question. It has hundreds of examples, all of them extremely well explained."
1,Skip on this book,I had this book for a SQL class that I took and this book was NO help at all. I learned SQL soley on the handout notes that the instructor gave out during class. This book is not easy to understand if you are a beginner and if you are one then pass on this book.
1,CH 1 badly written. Unless you already know SQL forget it.,Chapter One is so badly written without clear explanationsthat unless you already are very familiar with SQL AND have it loadedon a system at home/work you will be confused at what the author is attempting to convey. Further several of the illustrations do not match the actual program once loaded. Bottom Line: leave this book on the shelf and spend your money on something that will really help you.
2,better off bying something else,book was full of useless info. save yourself time and money and do not read this book
1,Not worth the ink printed on it,"Don't waste your time with this book. It contained so much useless information. There was hardly anything worth reading in it,"
1,Don't waste your time and money,This book was more of a knowlage book on how SQl integrates with nt. It lacks examples and true to life situations. Other than another paper weight for my desk it's useless.
4,Big improvement over 20 year old parts,"I recently replaced the lift supports on a 1990 Acura Integra which Amazon indicated these would be a direct fit. True to their word, the parts fit exactly. I was rather shocked to discover that the installation of these parts involved the removal of the oem mounting bolts. I assumed that this part would just attach to the OEM mountin bolts, but instead, new mounting bolts were provided. One problem with this is that the OEM mounts appear to be built of better quality, and they have a washer between the hatch and the mounting nut. I had to reuse the OEM washer, as the provided nut had very little grip on the original hole in the hatch. It would have worked without it, but it was apparent that the OEM setup was stronger in this regard.Bonus - I was able to reattach the original plastic trim to cover the mounting areas of the lift supports.After having my head whacked enough times, these struts are a great improvement. I wish I had done it earlier."
2,Arrived Damaged!,"This item arrived from the factory damaged. The box was pristine, but the metal bar that goes across the bottom of the fridge was badly bent, so that it wouldn't sit flat on the floor. The fact that the box was perfect tells me that it was damaged at the factory and still shipped out anyway. Then, when I called Haier, they wanted to charge me $15 to ship a new one out, even though it had been damaged at the factory!"
1,Don't waste your money!!!,Don't waste your money on this! It will break down in 1 year. It doesn't get cold enough and its a piece of crap! Their customer service is worthless as well! Stay clear of Haier!
2,didn't make it a year,"It worked great while it lasted, but it did not make it a year. I had sent in the warranty card after I purchased the unit, but when I called for support, they would not help without the original sales receipt. Apparently, the warranty card is strictly a marketing tool."
1,no customer service,Receved box in ok shape. Upon unpacking there was a dent on the side and bottom of the unit. Pluged it in and set the temp. After a full day the referagetor was warrmer than the out side temp. the motor on the back was hot. A friend who looked at it said the dent damaged the lines inside. I have sent three e mails to the company with no reply.To ship the unit back would be more than I paid for it.I can not recommended this company.
1,Not a good item,"I purchased this refrigerator for our office. As I had read in other reviews it was a little noisy. It was incredibly noisy. You could not talk when it cycled on. I left work on Wednesday, October 8th and returned to the office on October 14th to find the refrigerator had stopped working. All the milk products had turned sour and spoiled.Don't buy this item."
4,Just right and cheap,"I have owned this product for about two weeks. It was a little nicked up during shipping, but it survived intact.So far, I am completely satisfied with it. It was just the right size for my application and it works according to the manufacturer's specifications. The little ice tray is cute and the freezer effectively freezes water. It keeps my juice and half&half; cool. It fits easily under my work desk, which was a major requirement. I don't notice any obstrusive operating noises because of the ambient white noise in the building. Also, it was comparatively cheap at 89 bucks, including shipping. After reading the other reviews I was somewhat hesitant to select this product, but I considered the low risk factor and decided it was worth taking a chance on it. Also, I have never had any problems dealing with Amazon in the past."
1,seconds,"I am very dissapointed with this item! I makes a gurguling noise every time it kicks on. I have it in a building that is not attached to my house. It had a dent in the top edge when I opened it up. If I was told that I would be receiving a seconds item, then I would not have mined. NO WONDER IT WAS A GREAT PRICE! I have bought other compact refrigerators and you can not hear them running. I guess they were not seconds!"
1,poor service,The product was poorly packaged and arrived not working. The seller said if I sent it back and it did not work they would refund my money. If it did work they would refund 1/2. I spent $55 sending it back to the seller and they never contacted me or refunded any money.
1,Horrible Haier,"I had this delivered to my office and it did not work. The top of the unit became slightly cool, but the refridgerator (even after very carefully and precisely following the directions) stayed warm. I now have to go through the trouble of returning it and paying shipping fees. Stay away from Haier products!"
1,Fridge 12 cu ft,"We have bought 3 of those Haier refrigerators and all failed sooner or later.The 1st failed within less than 3 month of the purchase date and the other two in less than a year.Customer service is 3rd world (the most used excuse was that they do network maintenance or their computers had to be restarted. Agents are rude and unable to solve anything.Although Haier has replaced the 1st one after 2 months of repairs and customer service interactions, it has done nothing about the other two and it just dragged the issues so it could be claimed that the fridges went out of warranty.Do not waste your money on a Haier anything, it is not worth your peace!"
2,FRIDGE ARRIVED DENTED,"When my small refrigerator arrived FROM AMAZON DIRECT it was in bad shape. I could tell it was brand new by the smell and some packaging but the box it was in was terribly damaged. Oddly, the box was sliced open around the entire bottom (like maybe it was inspected?) and then strapped together with merely 2 plastic straps for packing expediency. Then when I cut the straps to lift off the box the door of the frig had a gouge/dent in it and paint pealed off there so it may likely rust. I don't know if Amazon or the shipping company are to blame. SO aesthetically, it isn't pretty but it does seem to be functioning ok so far. No, I'm not going through the hassle to send it back... I have more important things to do with my time. Disappointed Chris"
3,Good Enough,"I bought this Haier fridge for my smallish office, so I could have cold drinks all day (soda, juices). For the price (and the free and convenient shipping), it can't be beat. That's not to say it's perfect. Mine arrived damaged (the purely cosmetic triangular plastic cap for the door hinge, located at the top corner of the unit, was cracked and separated from the fridge itself, though it kind of clicks back on, though it's prone to falling off, as the greenish goo that holds it is kind of smeared off). Also, the cardboard box it's shipped in isn't really that well-made and was falling apart, so I wouldn't be surprised if the fridge doesn't work for the longish haul (never mind the long haul). The fridge is also pretty dirty and needs a wipe-down; there's a dusty film in places and it has a chemical odor to it. But again, for the price, this made-in-China fridge is just fine. Cold acai juice on the hour, every hour, here I come."
2,Strange odor,"I bought this refrigerator from Best Buy. The packaging was fine. However there has been a strange odor - chemical might be the right description from day 1. This is before I put bottled water inside, which is all it has ever had. I'm seriously concerned it's some kind of poisonous gas and will probably return."
1,"Horrible, horrible.","Do not buy this refrigerator! I bought this for my dorm, and I knew there was going to be trouble when the box arrived held together by a garbage bag. I plugged it in and left it for a few days, and it never got cold. A month later, still not cold at all. What a worthless piece of junk. I would send it back but the box was so mangled that it is impossible. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY!!!!"
2,Haier Refrigerator,"Unit is too small for what I need. I wanted to return it but you have to have a return code, which you get from the company that sold to Amazon, Computer Brain. You only have 5 days from the time you receive the code to return it. The shipping cost to return is more than the cost of the refrigerator so I now have a refrig on my hands that I can't use but don't want to pay more for the return than the refrig cost! I will not buy from the company again!"
2,Hoagy Deserves Better,"This disappointing, poorly produced collection is not worthy of Hoagy. If you are a Hoagy fan (as I am), look elsewhere."
1,Absolute Junk,This unit is about as useful and waving your hands over some cards and hoping that the correct answer falls out. The pH readings it produces do not match any of the more sophisticated equipment used to test soil pH. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this.
1,not worth the money,this thing only worked 3 times for me befor it stopped working. i used it as directed and it did work like i said 3 times. if you only want to use it once buy it. but if you are looking to use it on a regular basis. spend the money and buy a better one
4,works for me,just got this today and went to the internet to find common household ph standards. vinegar went to 3.5 and windex went past 9. the other review was right. it does need to be cleaned and they do include a small scottbright pad with. also bought the mositure meter it works as well
2,Indicator needle is slow to move and not very accurate,"I guess this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for, I bought a Luster Leaf 1840 Soil PH Meter made by Rapitest. I was kind of shocked to find out that it didn't need a battery but I didn't think about it much until I started using it, I also bought some PH testing/calibration fluid and it took several minutes for the needle to move and it never came close to reading what the PH fluid was rated for. I had similar experiences on speed of reading with both the fluid and soil tests.At best I would say that this meter will just get you in the ball park for seeing if the soil is Acid or Alkaline but its clearly not good enough to tell you exactly what the PH is by any number and be sure to give it 10-15 minutes to finally reach a final reading."
1,Save your money.,"Bought this tester as I'm somewhat colorblind and have trouble with the test kits using the powder. Stuck it in the soil after a rainstorm, and the needle didn't move. Cleaned the tip with the pad provided and got the same results. Took a scoop of soil, made mud in a cup, then put the probe into that. Needle moved maybe 1/8"" toward acid. Finally, I put the probe into a bottle of cider vinegar - needle moved 1/8"" towards acid. I resisted the temptation to stick the probe into a lead/acid battery!Figuring on a dead battery, I removed the back to install a fresh one. Surprise - no battery. Also, no electronics or circuit board. The two wires from the probe go to the meter, and that's it.Guess it's back to using the powder (get the wife to check the color) or send the samples to a lab."
1,Not a soil meter,This meter work when measuring pH solutions but not soil. Perhaps they need to create a standard procedure to make a soil soultion.
1,"If everything in the world has a PH of 6.9, it works.","Doesn't work right out of the box.Yes, I followed every detailed instruction. I completely cleaned the probe. I even went out and purchased distilled water for the soil sample. I paid attention to every review here and elsewhere and it's clear that this company sells two versions of this product:One that works (about 40%)One that doesn't work (about 60%)I'm not usually a gambling man, but for whatever reason I was convinced that I was going to purchase a version that worked. It didn't. I had a similar experience to others where it reads at something like 6.9 regardless of what you stick it in. I did the process several times, cleaning it several times, multiple soil samples, using the glass method and in the soil method it never changed the position of the needle. Really horrible quality control."
1,Nothing. Zilch. Nada.,"I tried what was suggested. I even put it in lemon juice. It still remains at 7. Now I don't have the receipt and I'm stuck with it. I tried a few others made by this company and still nothing. I'm going back to paper test strips.Okay, I am back again to review further. I scrubbed the tip with brillo and made it shine. It was now measure to 7.5 but still won't go lower than 7 in a glass of acidic fruit juice."
1,Garbage,"This product was garbage. I read the positve and negative reviews but thought I'd take a chance that the good reviews were more accurate.I will never buy from this company again. How can they legaly sell garbage, and preport that it works. This didn't work at all. No one buy from this company or any other that pulls this ""garbage"" on their customers."
1,Not for me,"The first moisture meter (this was not a pH meter) I received was defective (would barely register ""damp"" when placed in a glass of water and didn't budge when placed into wet dirt). I replaced it and got the same result with the second meter so sent it back for a refund."
1,Meter always shows a PH 7 no matter what you do,Had it all the way shipped from US to SG.Really not sensetive at all. Not sure is it spoiled since day 1. Follow the instruction manual on the probe cleaning and even try to remove any possible oxidiation that might case insensitive to the probe.Still dont work; the meter dont even move a bit after 1 mimnute after trying on different soil samples.Money go down the drain. :(
3,Luster Leaf 1840 Rapitest Soil pH Meter,"I saw all of the complaints against this meter. But because it was inexpensive, I decided to give it a try. I have found the readings to be highly variable and I have no way to determine their accuracy. Cleaning the probe does seem to help as some of the other reviewers mentioned and the soil must be moist. I have finally decided that I can at least get an idea of whether the soil PH is < 7 or > 7. This is enough to be useful."
4,Luster Leaf 1840 Rapitest Soil pH Meter,Clean it with fine steel wool before using and follow the provided directions and it works fine.
1,This Meter is Junk,"I have had this meter for two years and it is pure junk. I had tomato plants that were fed Miracle Grow for several months that were planted in peat moss and dirt. I know peat moss is slightly acidic, and the repeated use of nitrates in Miracle Grow every week for several months should have shown my pH was less than 6, yet this meter happily said it was 7.2. I tried testing pure white vinegar and the reading showed it was pH 7 (it should have been around 2). Finally, I had my soil tested professionally and found that my soil was pH 5.6 -- that is an error of almost two points!!! If this meter was simply broken, I would have replaced it, but in this case it acts as if it works, but gives an absolutely wrong result. If I could give this thing a negative star rating, I would do that. Do not buy this meter if you are looking for accurate pH readings! It is pure junk."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this meter because it was recommended (at a higher price) on a tomato-growers website. It never worked. Like the previous reviewer, I tried cleaning it. Still, the meter would not budge off of 7. Tomatoes are very ph sensitive. This was a waste of money."
5,Great way for kids to understand the parable of the vineyard,this is a very sweet story that depicts the Parable of the vineyard from Matthew (20:1-6) in a way that is easily related to by children. My son (4 1/2 years old) was delighted to read the bible version and connect the two stories. It helped him to understand the parable.
4,Isshinryu done right!,"If you are into Isshinryu Karate, you need to learn from someone who learned in Okinawa in the house it originated. Mike Reeves is just the person for the Job! Great way to learn the weapons Katas at home. Please make sure you move the lamp to avoid my accident!"
4,Good Wheels,"I like these wheels a lot, I bought them for an old school board I bought because I wanted that classic look. They are soft enough for cruising yet hard enough to make for easy slides. The only reason I'm not giving them five stars is because I haven't gotten the chance to see how long they will last, but they aren't too expensive so it's not that big of a deal if they don't last that long."
5,Excellent wheels!,"These are the best wheels I have ever had! I have had them for over a month and they are very durable. They are sort of an intermediate hardness. They're great for just cruising around town or dropping by your local park. They're big enough to absorb those little bumps and cracks in the road that cause you to ""eat it"" but still light enough for pulling off some flip tricks. Overall, they are excellent. I use them with some ABEC 9 Bullseye Bearings."
3,Self-help manual to overcome performance anxiety,"Combines anecdotes, clinical experiences, and the story of a psychotherapist who overcame her own anxiety and went on to a long career in treating anxiety disorders in people from all walks of life. Looks briefly into the childhood origins of social phobias. Definitely intended for people who have the problem, rather than a reference or introduction for outsiders. Probably worth a look if your concern goes beyond simple stage fright and approaches a social phobia that is interfering with your full enjoyment of life."
1,Warning: not original artists,I was very disappointed in this CD. Though the titles appear to make a great collection of 80's pop hits. Only when you listen do you understand that these are not the original artists but weak imitators.Not worth the money.
3,A decent movie!,"If you want to learn about his life its a good movie to learn from. Yet the movie its more of a narration told by narrator, where Pedro's life its shown to the viewers by pictures, scences and clips from a variety of his movies. There are no actors impersonating Pedro Infante nor acting out his life. Its a good movie just to learn more about Pedro Infante."
5,Super Cute,"This set is so cute, I love it. The envelopes alone are worth the price. The paper has ""snail mail"" printed all over one side and a solid colored animal shape with white writing space on the other side. It also comes with cute kitschy stickers for sealing."
5,Great,"I love the Bee Gees. I have the album that goes along with this book, and the book is in fantastic condition."
4,Never knew they had goods songs before disco,Nice book if you like to play chords and sing along. Guitar tab would have been nicer. Great older songs I never knew off. Talented song writers. Not really into the disco thing but some songs just great no matter what type of music it it.
4,Well written and compelling,"I just finished this book, and I'm going to remember this author's name. I do agree with the reviewer who said that Thorn existed solely to get beat up. I also think that the fate of some of the characters could've been better explained at the end. Another thing I liked was that the issue of endangered species trafficking was dealt with without the author being preachy about it. I also learned a thing or two about orangutans as well."
2,Crooked Fingers Must GO!!!!,"Saw Mr. Crooked Fingers over the weekend in San Diego. Had picked up this album prior to the show, but it was too late, the damage was done. The ticket had been purchased and unfortunately, I had dragged a loved down with me. This guy rots, and so do all his albums. I can't even begin to understand how another human being could enjoy this. The music eventually drove us to the far reaches of the club, like mice being repelled to edges of the cage by high frequency. i had to gut it out though, for he was the opening act. eventually, it became torture. needless to say, my date and I aren't together anymore, and I can only blame it on Crooked Fingers.Back to the album, its folky, stripped down, occasionally rockin, and very repetitive with miserable harmonies. there is hundreds of thousands of better albums out there. DON't DO IT!"
4,When are people going to herald Eric Bachmann as a genius?,"After the ascerbic wit and cacophony of Archers of Loaf and the lush yet bizarre arrangements of Barry Black, Eric Bachmann's new band Crooked Fingers proves that he's a brilliant musician with a firm sense of controlled ecclecticism - no matter what direction he goes, you know it's him.Crooked Fingers is melancholy yet inspirational. Twangy. Passionate. If you're only an Archers fan, you may not like this, as it's very different; just as catchy and melodic but not quite the rock-in-a-blender of AOL. But give it a chance. Please. You won't regret it.(It loses one star because some of the songs have a slight Pogues feel, and I hate the Pogues.)"
4,Ten Days That Unexpectedly Changed America,"I've only watched part of this tape so far, but enjoyed it very much. I think my students will enjoy watching it in class."
4,Whimsical and honest,"This playful, silly, all-too-honest book made my day. It's full of reasons to nap, excuses to nap, ways to make naptime more playful, and more. When I was done reading it, I went and took a nap (guilt-free, of course!)"
2,More of the same...,"I love SARK, her ideas and creativity, her wonderful books, and the way she can inspire. However, the nap book feels forced and ""old"". Its the same stuff from Succulent Wild Woman and the Bodacious Book... but re-iterated in a small, hard cover form. Succulent Wild Woman was so fresh and so exciting that the Nap Book definitely feels disappointing. Hopefully the next one will have some new ideas and some new insights."
5,I love SARK!,"I am the Nap Queen! I'm a children's writer and , thanks to SARK, I've written nearly all of my stuff sitting up in bed and wearing my jammies!This is a great book."
5,Nap Time!,I first discovered the SARK books when I was a junior in high school. Ever since then I have been in love with them! They are great inspirational self-help books. The pages are in full color and completely uplifting. This book is no exception.
1,Don't Buy,"This is the second of this same item I received. This cable does not fit my phone, nor does the software have anything to do with my phone. On my last review this company offered to replace the cables and provided a link to some free software stating that it would help me connect to my phone, however this ""free software"" does not support my phone. (sanyo M1). I checked with this company after they offered to replace my products to make sure that they would replace both of them. They informed me that I never ordered a second cable. How ever I am stuck with two cables that do not fit my phone and ""free software"" from another site that does not support the phones of today. Well guy's here is the feedback for the second order that you say that I did not order."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH KATANA 6600 PHONE,"I have the same problems, the connector does not fit the Katana 6600 Phone as stated by the item description. Save your money and the drivers will not install on a windows xp machine. Thank god this was cheap because you will lose your money. I wish I would have read the reviews be for I order this item."
1,sanyo katana,this product did not work for the katana...the cable was cheep in a good way(cost)...but the katana needs a driver to connect through usb..and sanyo never developed one...
5,Go Eagle rock,"For material that is over 20 years old this Blu-ray gives a compelling visit with the lategreat Etta James the Queen of the blues.Having seen Etta twice live this blu-ray did not disappoint either visually or phonically.It includes her hallmark cut At Last as well as my other favorites How Strong Is a Woman,I Got the Will,Tell Mama,,Come to Mama, and more.Eagle rock is fast becoming a trusted name for Blu-ray concerts of any vintage!For under 20 dollars this was a no brainer for me."
2,Picture Misleading,"I was expecting 3 rings, I just got one, the picture is missleading and it does not specify a quantity anywhere in the description, the ring is ok but in my opinion the price is too high for only one ring."
1,MISLED,"This is BS false advertising, I also expected 3 rings as shown in the pic!!!!Not worth the price for just one.Why would the other sizes show one and the 6"" show 3 and only include 1...fix this so more people aren't misled."
4,rings from Amazon... pots bought at local hardware ...sizing off on some,"take your rings with you when you go to buy the pots...I bought six 6"" rings , bought six 6"" pots at a well-known hardware store earlier in month...well some of the pots were less than 6 inches (even though label said 6 inches)....they would have fallen thru ring....not fault of ring maker...but to avoid frustration don't forget to measure both pots and rings !"
4,Great for non-financial executives,"I am a CFO of a public company as well as a partner in a CPA firm. The book was very informative but for me it was 75% stuff I already knew. The software chapter was heplful but seemed biased. The book has several minor technical errors but nothing that would really mislead a novice. I bought 5 more copies to give to my controller, board chairman and a division president, as well as to two clients. My six year old son gets a real kick out of the title and exclaims ""Sarbanes Oxley for Dummies!"" every time he sees it on my night table (could he be a budding SOX consultant??)."
5,Fabulous reading,Humorous treatment of the subject matter that does not compromise quality of info. I recommend it for anyone who needs to be up on this law.
2,too biased to be of much value,"This book is presented as a fair overview of the history and current situation regarding hemp. It is so biased, however, that one wonders what Bourrie is not saying. There are rather lengthy sections which delve into greater social concerns which really are wholly irrelevant, despite Bourrie's weak attempts at connecting them. The book is probably best considered a piece of propaganda. I took it out from a library hoping to learn some basic information about hemp and unfortunately, after having read this book, I don't believe that I succeeded."
1,did not send,I ordered two books and recieved only one as of yet 6 weeks out. Tried to contact the seller with no reply. It is very frustrating when you do not recieve the goods purchased
2,not that good,"This book was very repetitive and not well-organized. It should be about half as long as it is. The diagrams were not helpful either. A lot of the case studies offered no solutions or solutions that you could have thought of yourself, or solutions that wouldn't work in the real world."
3,Nursing School Requirements,I'm sure these book are great but I only bought them because they were required when I was in nursing school. This is not what I would consider everyday reading enjoyment but they served their purpose well.
4,It's Good,"It's a good resource and required reading, neither love it,nor hate it. As far as textbooks go the reading ""flow"" is easy, good. Some of these textbooks can be very technical (full of medical terms, and unnecessary jargon) and have horrible flow making it hard to read, but this was good."
3,Easy to use except capsules disintegrate,"Living in Panama, and have no state or local farm agency to test the soil here, so I bought the kit in NJ. It worked to some degree, but as others have noted the capsules are very difficult to deal with and some were totally disintegrated in the pkg. Needless to say, I was not flying back to NJ to return the product, but it is hardly worth the effort to do the tests, having been a gardener all my life I'll stick to the old method, if it's growing leave it alone, if it's not try cow or chicken manure, if that's not working try lime !!!!"
4,good,The kit is nice. The dropper is a little cheap but used it with no problems. Remember to use distilled water for better results.
1,Wasn't sure about the results,"I used this kit several times for each of the tests. I draw the sample and shake it well, allowing it to settle for at least a day. You then draw a small sample of the ""clear"" solution. After allowing the sample to mix with the precipitate, the particals coagulate and settle to the bottom. Then the solution is always on the low end of the color spectrum. Shake it, and the solution appears on the top end of the spectrum. I guess if you let the sample sit for about 4 days, or may be a week or so, and carefully draw the solution for the test, you might get a better result.I really question the accuracy of this kit based on this."
2,Soil Test Kit,"pH worked well. Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium tests were not as clear. They took longer to react. I used this in school and my students got impatient waiting for the results."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this test kit hoping to find out how my garden soil is doing. I had our land professionally tested several years ago and followed the directions for amending the soil, and wanted to see how well it was doing. This time, I decided to ""cheap out"" and buy a test kit. Bad mistake. I sampled from seven different sites on my land according to the directions. In each case, I have excess K, and no appreciable N or P. This completely defies logic, as there's plenty already growing there and it would not be if there was insufficient nitrogen. Don't waste your money. Use your state or county extension agency and have them do the soil testing. For about the same price, you'll get accurate information as well as instructions for amending your soil."
2,Worthless Nitrogen Reading in Clay Soil,We have clay soil that's amended with compost and manure. We found the test kit was easy enough to use but it gave us a zero nitrogen reading. So we further amended the soil and it did not improve. So we put a nitrogen granule in the test water and it still read zero. After 48 hours the water remains cloudy so this might affect the readings but I can't really trust any reading.
2,Not enough instruction for amount of water/soil,I have had to look for more instructions on how to use the kit. The kit only provided the soil/water ratio for ph. There was no indication on the proper soil/water ratio for the rest of the tests.
4,Good,Price is very good for the number of tests you get. I don't know how accurate the readings are but I assume (I know)that the readings are close enough for a home garden.
3,It worked,"It worked okay, my soil ph tested fine but the other tests take days and I haven't tested those yet."
1,directions in freakin' spanish,as the title says my directions and even the packaging were in spanish. i've looked everywhere on this site for somewhere to ask for english directions. am i going to have to return the whole thing. i tried the packaging feedback site but they say they just aggregate the responses and don't respond directly. any and all help will be greatly appreciated.
2,soil tester not very useful,I used this test several times each with difficulty. Tubes easily fall over spilling the content and a funnel seems to be the best way of emptying the content of the capsules.I will not know until spring if it was worth pursuing
1,Not Accurate,I tested soil samples from 2 garden plots. One sample was from my home garden where I knew the soil was fine. The second was from another location miles from my house. I was having growing vegetables at that location.Both tests gave the same results. PH OK and nitrogen and phosphorous depleted. The soil at my house is full of organic matter and everything grows great. So to have a test to say 2 nutrients were deplete tells me there is something wrong with the test kit.
1,"3/4 tests were useless, 4th was suspect","After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests, none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read ""6""... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon, so these tests give unreliably ""alkaline"" results). The purified water test also came out ""alkaline"". All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result, 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K, P, or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes, 20, 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read ""adequate"" for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either, so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So, all in all, it was a tremendous waste of money and time."
3,Fair to middlin,"I'm not really convinced that the tests are that accurate. I'm a biochemist so am fairly familiar with good lab technique. I gathered soil samples, mixed them quite well, then used this test on a portion and sent a portion to the Penn State agriculture lab for testing. My pH was lower than their measurement by about 0.8 which would cause me to add quite a bit more limestone to my yard. I wasn't able to get a decent reading for N, P, or K as my soil just wouldn't settle enough. (needed a centrifuge I guess) All in all, I'll use it again in the spring to see how the soil responded but I'm not confident in the results. The price seemed right but..."
3,Doesn't store well,"As others said, it works fairly well, although the process is a bit involved. A warning, though: the capsules do not store at all well. I followed the storage directions, but over the course of two years they pulled a lot of moisture in from the air. Once they do that, they won't dissolve well any more, making them useless. So don't buy more than you need for one season, and then just throw out leftovers at the end of the year. I'd even be a little nervous about a set remaining active over a single season.I also wish they sold replacement capsules at prices significantly less than the starter set. It offends my sense of ecology to have to buy a new set of the little containers each year. I'd actually prefer they raised the initial cost a bit and improved the method of getting the capsules into the right part of the container, perhaps by including a funnel."
1,Worthless,"Worthless for anything besides a grade school project. Ran several tests of same soil sample, results all over the place. Soil used is to small to get a good average. better to buy Scotts and send it to them."
4,Great and simple to use,"I have used this product for many years, I find very easy to use for my gardening and lawn maintenance."
3,Soil ph kit,"Not easy to use, I dont like it too much. It has to sit a long time after test for stuff to settle. There has to be a better way. The little color coded pills they give u don't dissolve right. It also has a short shelf life. Tried to contact with query, not response. Save urmoney people! Good luck, hope this helps."
1,Worthless. Use and Destroy your soil.,"more than loss of money, i wasted 2 hours testing, and had i followed the results would have wacked out my lawn and garden.have you soil analyzed by a lawn service, a private lab, or your local cooperative extension services[...]"
1,Soil test,I purchased your kit 1601 and followed the instructions to the letter. I could not use the phosphorus test due to the capsules crumbling in my hand or hand already crumbled in the bag. I also had difficulty getting the K test capsules apart. I had 2 friends try and had same result!!! I feel like I just spent a lot of time wasting money and my time!!!
4,Good for testing,Product was very good for testing the soil. It was eay to use and instuctions were easy to follow. The one draw back is the information on how to fix problems with the soil was not very good.
4,Exactly what I was looking for,Great item. It was exactly what I was looking for. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because they didn't offer the refill chemicals so I had to order two of these items.
4,Great purchase,Easy to use. Told me exactly what was wrong in the garden. I noticed the different within a week after following the instructions to correct the problem.
4,Fun!!!!,I love to travel personaly myself. This is a great game for children and all ages to enjoy. A guy named Fog and his pal Sidney are competing against his arch rival Hogsbreath to travel around the world in 80 days first. Hurry and buy this game before Hogsbreath beats you back to London!
2,"Boring , Lackluster Performance.","I bought several ice skating tapes from Amazon and I returned this one. The praises for it such as 'dazzling', 'lavish' and 'beautiful' are much more appropriate for another tape -- ' Nutcracker On Ice' with Oksana Baiul as the leading performer. This Ice Capades features Dorothy Hamill as a rather aged Cinderella who has lost grace and agility and her performance is technically unchallenging. I was disappointed not to see those spins ,jumps, loops, double& triple axels which are exciting and beathtaking.The pair skating of Cinderella and the Prince is uninteresting and bland. If there is not much to see from the main characters, what is there to see? I felt more delight in watching the skaters at Rockafeller Plaza than this."
5,Baby see 'n sign review,"I bought this video just after the birth of my daughter and let my boy's ages 4 and 6 watch it. They love it and sign words from it all the time. When my daughter was about 6 months old I started putting it on for her to watch. Right off I noticed that it held her attention very well. she is now 9 months old and is already signing 2 or three words (Eat, Baby, and trys many others). It's amazing. I can't wait untill volumn two comes out this spring. I highly reccomend this video to anyone who has any interest at all in teaching their baby to communicate early. Thank you so much Kathy Kronz!"
2,"Okay, but my baby wasn't charmed","I'm a big fan of signing with infants. I experienced the many benefits with my first child a few years ago. I was hoping this video would be cute, charming and engage my daughter, but it didn't. There are more charming videos out there that you watch with your baby but I think it would be tacky to mention them here -- after all, your baby has to like watching the video for it to work. However, Baby Signing is a great thing, do it no matter what products you use!"
4,Very good with room for improvement,"While this is a very good video, many of the signs are made at the BOTTOM of the screen and they are hard to see what she is doing. The signs SHOULD always be made in the line of sight, or at the main focal point - the center of the screen.Also they frequently fail to incorporate the appropriate activity or object in the picture, they just have the lady standing there saying a word and signing it. For an adult, or older child that is fine, but boring. A baby needs the object or activity, along with the spoken and signed word. But, overall, compared to most of this type of video available, it is good. I got spoiled with ""Talking Hands"" video, and wish others were as well done."
3,Needs more practical words,"I must have had too high of expectations for this video. While I was impressed with the repetition and clarity of the signs demonstrated, I was disappointed in the limited practical signs. I would like to have seen more ""food"" signs. Also, signs for ""thank you"", ""all done"", etc. were not included in this video. The farm segment could have been eliminated altogether and replaced with more practical words/signs used daily. I am currently looking for a more comprehensive video."
3,Pretty Good,"I recently purchased Signing Time and then Baby See 'N Sign Vol.1&2. Signing Time, I believe is better for younger children. My children definitely enjoy that DVD more. There are children doing signs and lots of music and it is very playful. However, the See 'N Sign DVDs have more signs and they are a little cheaper. If you are wanting to have a variety of programs to teach & reinforce signs to your child, then these are a good buy.Also, these are available on DVD at their website."
2,Okay...,"I found this book to have an interesting plot, but the characters were very shallow. I agree with a previous reviewer in that the main character, Rollo, is VERY, VERY, GOOD. He is too good, in fact. The evil characters are VERY, VERY, EVIL. The characters don't have any personal conflict(at least any that I noticed). I'm glad that it helped someone to learn to read better, but if you can already read well, then you shouldn't waste money on this book."
1,REALLY shallow!,"I read this book because it was a free book that I got from school. Now, I am a total fantasy nut, and let me tell you, this book was horrible! The characters are shallow, there is no personal conflict, and you know who is GOOD, and who is EVIL. I think that it is great that it got someone's son to learn how to read, but other than that, I don't think this book is useful for anything. If you want to read some good fantasy, try Tamora Pierce (she is my all time fav author), Diane Duane, Phillip Pullman, Eoin Colfer, Diana Wynne Jones, Gail Carson Levine, William Corlett, Madeleine L'Engle, J.K. Rowling, or A College of Magics (I can't remember the author right now), but don't try John Vornholt."
2,A waste of time,"I didn't finish this book, just skimmed over the last half. After the narrator found the money, the story really bogged down and became unbelievable. As for the humor, I didn't find much of anything above junior high level.The coverage of Huntington's disease is one of the better ones I have seen in fiction; it was generally clear and factual, but I really couldn't see how this issue pertained to the rest of the story."
2,Humor is out of place for a Christian book,"Book was recommended by a friend but I didn't get past the chapter called ""Church"" because I just don't think that we should have to be joking about things like like this. Why would the writer describe for instance a doctor who told people that they had a week to live so that he could witness to them about eternal life? This is not funny. This is tragic! We are to be sober and vigilant, not funny and entertaining. There is nothing humorous about church or the gospel message. We need to cut out this sort of thing."
4,A pleasure to read,"This is really the most fun I've had reading a book in years. The author is to be commended. I'll definitely be checking out his other titles. Some of the humor was a little over the top, but it's amazing how such a funny writer can also make you cry. Haven't had that happen before. Overall, a very very good book. Can't think of one I've enjoyed so much, except possibly one of Grisham's novels."
2,Cartirdge leaks,"The cartridge leaks and doesn't give me clean copies. It leaves a band of ink spots on both sides of the page. The low toner light is back on after only a few weeks of use when cartridges in the past lasted at least a year. It is not only a mess, but a terrible inconvenience. I have no backup at this point and haven't had time to seek a solution."
4,Replacement lights for a classic camper,I used the lights on a classic pop up camper that I am fixing up to use to go camping. They were easy to mount up and wire.
2,Interesting but poorly organized,"This is a nice book to look at, but the information is poor. There are thousands of typeo's and some breed photos are used more than once when explaining a different breed. I do not recommend buying this book, I recomend The New Encyclopeida of The Horse. This book was poorly organized, sloppy. Go spend your money elsewhere, trust me."
3,"Great Shoe, Terrible P","I was sooooo excited when I came across this shoe. I'm a pretty tall gal and I'm always on the lookout for a shoe that's cute without the skyscraper heel. I ordered this shoe in three colors: fuschia, black and khaki.They are comfortable and they look better in person. I'm very pleased with my purchase, but I'm not so pleased with the Amazon's quality control. The pair I ordered in khaki (tan) came in a khaki green. I thought no worries, I spoke to someone in customer service (very nice person) and explained the mix-up.I received the replacement pair today...another pair of the khaki green; Funny, because the green isn't a color option.Overall I give the shoe a five and the product oversight process a three.Oh well, you know what they say about the third time and all....."
3,Decent Regency...not Ms. Hazard's best.,"The storyline in this book is what threw me off.The writing is as usual exceptional and the characters, fascinating. I just couldn't really understand why Lady Juliet dragged her fears on and on when the Duke of Severn had shown himself willing to understand many many times.The 'misunderstanding' between them just didn't feel right and was very contradictory at times. The issue of her dark secret was also fairly anti-climactic by the time we were allowed to know what it was and didn't inspire me to like the character or believe in her any more than I already did.Not a bad Regency, but not the best either."
4,a keeper....,"Simple short story, please see product review page for synopsis.The story flowed well, better I think than the ""Singular Miss Carrington"" the preceding book to this one, were the ending just got tedious.Two things that threw me off1) Why was our Heroine ""LADY"" Juliet Manchester? There was no mention that her father was a noble man, supported by the fact that her only sibling and brother was a vicar.2) Why was the ""third"" son of the Duke given a courtesy title of ""Viscount""? When the Heir and the spare to the Dukedom were alive and well and touring Greece!!!Other than those two mistakes, I found the book to be very entertaining and I'm beginning to get used to Historical romance novels waiting till the last few pages before a declaration of love is made. Even then the whole story flowed very nicely with plenty of humor intermingled within each chapter as well as the plentiful escapades of the twin daughters of the duke."
2,dreadful sums it up,Why on earth would any woman fall in love with someone like the Duke? He is not likable. There is no believable chemistry between the two of them. We are not given any reason to understand how the two of them would fall in love with each other. The twins and the opening scene when the Duke finds her in the lake are the only enjoyable parts of this book.
3,Action & Adventure in Old Los Angeles,Zorro & the Dragon Riders is a good read. In the beginning it almost felt like an episode of the Disney Guy Williams TV show but then it got better with the introduction of the Japanese samurai. I liked the themes of honor and commitment throughout the book. Zorro has his code of honor where he does not kill and wants to save the people from harm while the Dragon Riders have their own code that is tarnished under the service of the Aztec villian. I don't know if this book was a continuation of another novel but it felt that way because Zorro was out of action in a small section of the story. It was a good story with elements of action and humor.
3,Zorro can make any story good.,Zorro and the Dragon Riders is a very detailed novel. Everything is adventerous and thrilling. The story was somwhat confusing now and then because it did not have a solid plot. This is only my opinion though. Zorro can make any story good............................................
3,Amazon Prime this one if you have nothing to do,"This is average at best, sometimes you might wince how off some of the voices are, but you get some decent guitar play. I just didn't think it deserved 1 star."
2,Morecambe and Wise,"purchased as CHRISTMAS gift, so I have not viewd it. But assume iy will be a hit when retrieved from the Xmas tree."
2,People can't hear me,"Another reviewer mentioned this before I bought this but I thought maybe it wa just one bad unit. No. People constantly tell me they can't hear me. I can hear them fine. This is a product defect. Also, my previous 2-line Panasonic had caller ID on the base. You must know how important that is; I can't believe they took off this feature. If privacy was their reason, there are ways around that (like having an option of no ID on the base in setup). I REALLLLY miss that!! Most features are pretty good but they are wiped out by the need to yell into the phone. Oh, also, the speaker phone part is bogus. That is fine to have it in the handset, but that is THE ONLY PLACE it is available. Shop further until Panasonic fixes this."
5,Excellent Manual!,Anyone planning to start a group for people with dementia should read this.Ms. Yale is an expert & this book is a must read.
2,"Scholarly, but not Biblical","He put alot of work into his research. He has a long list of theologians with impressive credentials. However, this book is not Biblical. He has so few Scriptures to support his belief, that he is very selective and repetitive about the Bible verses he talks about. Perhaps this explains why he spends so much time quoting theologians. He claims to refute conditional immortality, but he does not even touch it. It is clear that he does not even understand conditional immortality. How can he refute what he does not understand?"
3,For me these have been just average int terms of wear.,Hard to evaluate these pads because I think I may have brake system problems outside of the pads. Having frontmaster cylinder rebuilt along with front caliper seals -- 2004 Sportster.
1,"Save yourself, you're the only one who can","I hated this book for all the same reasons that the previous reviewer loved it. Latour's voice changes add some depth to the story, but are done in a manner so convoluted that much of the substance is lost. Using Aramis itself as the voice of martyred technology just becomes increasingly absurd throughout the book. There are much better books than this out there about man's relationship with technology, do yourself a favor and find one of them."
3,Political thriller,"Senator Nick Schlafer is trying to push through a Bill in Congress, legalising drugs and drug taking.The President and most of his political opponents are adamently against such a move and Nick is accused of using the bill to make up for his daughters apparent suicide from a heroin overdose.He becomes involved with a high ranking mafia member who agrees with the proposed Bill because it coincides with mob interests.Perhaps this type of writing will appeal to readers with an interest in political situations but I really couldn't work up much interest and was able to identify ""The Crooked Man"" of the title almost immediately."
3,Great potential but fails to deliver,"'A Crooked Man' features U.S. Senator Nick Schlafer who has proposed to de-criminalize drugs across the United States. Soon afterwards he is caught up in a confusing maelstrom of drug power players who may or may not want the bill to be passed, including the Drug Czar and mafia-types.Schlafer's difficulties are complicated by a messy family background, inlcluding a daughter whom police believe slit her wrists while high on drugs. Family politics and national politics become intertwined and the book really starts to lose its focus. Schlafer is confused about who to trust and family secrets are exposed that shake him to his foundations. However, so many different things are going on that Lehmann-Haupt does a poor job of keeping all of the strands moving forward in a credible and meaningful way.While a breeze to read, I was not terribly impressed. I give this one a grade of C+."
5,This is a book you can hear.,This is a book you can hear...the interviews with people who live in western North Carolina are so well done that as you read you can hear the people speaking. This book covers many topics from farming to history. A good cross section of people gives the reader the opportunity to read different opinions on the varied topics. The book is filled with excellent photograhs. Especially interesting are photographs of most of the people interviewed in the book. Putting faces with the 'voices' is a real treat! The reader gets a good overview of the history of the area and insights into often ignored aspects of the culture of this georgous part of the US. This book is a good research tool for anyone learning about the area and it is entertaining reading as well. I love it!
1,Alvin and the Chipmunks rock!...that's all folks!,"With the exception of the Alvin and the Chipmunks scene, this film is literally a disaster. Since I couldn't give it a zero, the single star goes to the Chipmunks. The rest of this abomination is a total waste of time."
3,Good,Got this for my son. Worked great. My son loved this movie. I have yet to see it. Thanks so much.
1,"Oh my goodness, how did this movie get made???","This move it just terrible. I mean really raunchy bad. Save your eyes, save your soul, DO NOT watch this terrible movie. It has no plot, no point, only teen sex, teen sex, teen sex... Over and over again. The only people who would enjoy this movie are desperate teen boys who have no life and can't get a girlfriend.Again,Save your soul, DO NOT watch this terrible movie!"
3,Disaster Movie : Not a Complete Disaster,"I just watched this movie today, because I read about how bad the movie is, and the people and the critics' ratings. So, I watched it. It wasn't that bad as what I thought. There's just a couple of 'funny' moments, but overall, it was just a plain movie."
1,Ghastly...,"I cannot believe how poor this movie is. I didn't expect anything as entertaining as Scary Movie, but I did expect that it would be roughly on par with Date Movie. Boy was I mistaken. If you really must see Carmen and Kim, go rent it for a buck; do not waste your money on this film. I bought it without having seen it, and threw it away after watching it."
1,This sucked,"After the Scary Movie series thses films went to total garbage. Meet the Spartans, Diaster Movie, SuperHero movie were all total tripe. This movie is not funny and the films title is self discription: it is a total Disaster in every sence. Whoever directed it should be shot for making such a waste of time film. This is one of those movies where you curse it and demand your wasted two hours of life back...it's that bad. To much dance off's and gay music just like Meet The Spartans.....just lame and stupid."
1,Trash At Its Finest,"How do these movies keep being made you ask...oh thats right because of a younger generation who have never even heard of 'airplane' or 'The Naked Gun', and presume this is spoof comedy. I have seen this vile garbage but I never gave the studio the money COUGH! COUGH!, if you know what I mean. This does not even deserve the title ""movie"" , as it is a 90 min cash cow of pure torture. These horrific spoofs must be stopped NOW!!!! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.You will like this movie if:A) Your very young [...] and have a no real knowledge of what a great comedy film is and laugh at every lame pop culture reference in this , I can understand that.B) You have a very special mental condition..."
1,this movie doesn't deserve one star,this is the worst movie I seen in my life. don't waste your time wiht this one...trust me!
1,Disaster Movie,"It was a DISASTER!!! I am a big spoof/stupid humor movie kind of guy, but this was really really pathetic. In fact, I gave the Blu-Ray away to a co-worker, wouldn't even want to re-sell it."
1,"Best ""Worst Movie"" Ever!","This is one of the greatest ""terrible"" movies I have ever seen. The production value is top notch- great dancing, stunts...Musical numbers are almost Broadway quality. You need to be a pretty avid movie goer to get the fact that every single aspect of this movie is making fun of some other motion picture.But, enough is enough- No matter how well you do this stuff- it has to turn out bad in the end. However, this movie is just about the best ""worst movie"" I have ever seen. unfortunately, in 20 years no one will will have any idea of what or whom they are making fun of.---- Keep an eye out for Crista Flanagan, who plays the role of Juney. I believe this girl has a future in the business."
2,Its a disaster alright.....,"Found the first skit, and the music the best parts of this movie...therest is not even worth talking about.and no......a 24 will not make it better."
1,Da Bomb. Kaboom!,"Yup, this movie sucks! That's all the time I'm going to waste on it! That is all the people need to know!"
5,Very funny!!,"Is a good comedy . I laught from the begin until the end !! Matt is a good comedian actor ,he`s very funny!."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"No plot. Horrible acting. And not ONE SINGLE FUNNY MOMENT! How do dogs like this get made? Who did the producers sleep with to get the money? Did anyone actually read the rag before signing on for this?Not Funny. Not funny. Not funny. Not funny.Avoid like the plague. Do not buy or rent. If you know someone who did, slap them until they wake up....then slap them again for their stupidity.One star only because Amazon doesn't allow a -10."
1,The title of the movie says it all,"Given the choice of again getting a shot under my fingernail (the only time I've actually screamed in pain and saw stars) and sitting through this movie again, I'll take the shot. How these guys get funds to make movies as awful as this and epic movie is beyond me. Not even a neanderthal could find anything in this movies to laugh at."
1,simple matemathics,"It's imples: while the ""movies"" made by this duo of ""directors"" make more money than they cost to be produced, they will continue doing them. Tragic."
1,I want my eyes back.,"Everything about this movie is wrong... and by 'everything about this movie is wrong"" I mean there is no excuse or punishment worthy of the sack of stupid that decided to put Kim Kardashian in a move that already sucked from the first frame.DO NO WASTE YOUR LIFE ON THIS AMAZINGLY TERRIBLE AND PAINFUL TORTURE SPIRAL."
5,Great for Photo Prop,I'm a photographer and am using this as a photo prop for the toddlers I shoot. Has been working out great. Got the oak and if it's not real oak it's pretty darn close. Not a cheap soft wood. Highly recommend.
5,Perfect!,I was looking for a rocking horse that my 18 month old could ride. She loves it. No complaints at all.
5,Rockin' Rocking Horse,"I first bought a rocking horse just like this from a baby furniture store for my first niece. When niece #2 showed up, my sister asked for another horsey for the other girl. I went back to the baby store and their supplier no longer carried the rocking horse. I was devastated! Until... I came to amazon.com and looked it up. I found a few different choices, but eventually found the exact same horsey! It was a shade lighter than the other horsey, but I think it's even from the exact same warehouse! I can't wait for niece #2 to start using her horsey. It's a GREAT present! My sister raises horses, so it's perfect for her, but her daughter spends a lot of time ridine ""Bullseye"" as she has named him! It's a well crafted horsey and definitely worth the money."
4,Not as big as it looks,"It is a nice, sturdy rocking horse. Was also easy to assemble, however it looks much larger than it actually is. I was expecting a rather large rocking horse that my daughter would be able to use for the next few years. When assembled, it looks like she may outgrow it as early as three. Just keep the smaller stature in mind."
4,My daughter loves it.,"We bought this for our 6 year old (she's pretty small for her age) and she thinks it's great. She fits on it with her feet on the floor (I don't see that a disadvantage). Obviously, she could flip it if she rocked too hard, but she's old enough to know better.The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, was that the paint on the horse had a strange odor. Most people probably wouldn't notice, but I get migraines and really sensitive to odors. I sprayed it with Lysol and set it in the sun for a couple of days and the smell is getting less noticeable."
5,So cute!,"This came in a box and had to be put together, which was fine because once together, it is the cutest rocking horse! The mane and tail make it so cute! Oh, and it was so easy to put together that my 13 year old son did it with no problems at all."
3,Horse hair,"Note: My child likes to pull the hair out, so just FYI, the string used for the hair (mane and tail) comes out easily. Other than that, my child likes rocking on it."
5,great choice,I did a thorough search when I wanted to get a traditional gift for a newborn that was not plastic and did not have 100 bells and whistles. I made a great choice. It arrived as predicted - all pieces in the box in perfect shape - and easy to assemble. The proof of its success was when the older brother took right to it and gave it the toddler seal of approval !
5,One Toy Worth Keeping Out,"If you're looking at the picture above and have mixed feelings about the mane and tail, don't worry. The horse I got had a deep red mane and tail that matched perfectly.Also, as long as you have a philips-head screwdriver you have everything you need to put it together. For something so simple to put together it is surprisingly well made and sturdy. The design of the runners prevent all but the most violent and deliberate efforts to tip over.Also, the lack of a bridle rope hanging down is a design advantage. It give the child no option other than holding onto the pegs or the neck, both more secure than holding onto a loose bridle rope.In summary, well made and a joy to the kids who ride it, this Cherry Rocking Horse is so attractive it is one toy you won't mind leaving out when company come."
4,Natural Wood is different than picture; Tail fell off!,"We had a hard time choosing which finish we wanted on this rocking horse. Most of our wooden toys are natural wood- usually a birch or maple. The picture of the natural horse looked almost white and the color of the yarn wasn't our favorite so we were a little leary. But we didn't want to go with the oak or cognac either b/c we knew those would be too dark. Well just in case anyone is considering the natural finish but unsure of how it will look, it's beautiful! It's a very, very light oak. And the yarn complements it nicely, unlike in the picture. We are very happy with our purchase!One month later, the tail came off! It's just stapled on and I'm glad I caught it before the kids started playing with and/or lost the staple for our crawling baby to find! Not sure how we're going to reattach it, but hopefully we can come up with something safer than a staple!Otherwise we still love this toy!"
4,Nice rocking horse -- and cheaper than most others.,"This is a really nice rocking horse, and is even better than that when you compare the price of it to many others. Assembly is required, but not hard. The hardest part of assembly is making sure the runners are set right. My 1-year old nephew loves his new rocking horse!"
2,cute but needs better screws,"My kids love the horse, but the screws are constantly falling out. The head and body become loose after pony a few times riding it. Pretty annoying."
2,Disappointed,"We ordered this rocking horse as our grandson's Christmas gift. When we opened the box to assemble it, one of the critical pieces was broken in two! I wish I could evaluate the assembled rocking horse, because although the product was not as substantial as it appeared in its photo, I would have replaced it for his occasional use at our house. Alas, it was out of stock and could not be reordered. On the plus side, returning it to Amazon could not have been easier!"
1,she loves it,my kids found it easy to put together and my granddaughter loves it. she climbed on and started rocking right away.
4,Great value and great fun!,"My husband had no trouble putting the horse together for our grandson. It was just the right size, he loves it!"
5,Quick and Easy,Item is exactly as described. I used them to hang a baby quilt on the wall in nursery and they work perfectly. They also arrived quickly with no problems.
4,I don't know about this song.......,Shakira's voice isn't like the voices of others pop singers.She has quite unusal voice that changes alot through the entire songWhat I can say about this song that it's a nice song that grew on me.
2,Straining to understand the words,"This album, while I enjoyed the photos in the CD jacket, is not a must-have in my book. Shakira is extremely easy on the eyes, but very difficult on the ears. She has an unusual and unique singing voice that would probably best be suited for singing in her native language of Espanol. I have listened to her in interviews, and her accent is both sensual and easily coherent. However, when singing, her lyrics get mumbled together. I, for one, am the type that likes to sing along with the radio, not strain an ear trying to decipher what is being said."
5,"Comforting, serene music",This is an excellent CD to listen to at home or at work or anywhere I am trying to relax. It is truly a good buy.
1,"this guy sucks, bad",Funky Cowboy is the stupidest song I have seriously ever heard in my whole life.you should probably re-think your taste in music if you even consider buying any of this guys albums.
5,The Majesty of Spain,"It is an excellent and easily understandble text on the court objects within a specific time frame in Spain, particularly the court of Charles IV. It is organized, colorful and well-written. I recommend it as a purchase for those who are interested in the court and art objects of Spain during the reign of Charles IV and his predecessors and followers."
1,MIB not so real,"So I receive my pets MIB costume and it no way looks like the picture.Where to start:1st: the material is odd.2nd: the tie is a ""strip"" of black material,were in the picture it has a in-dent by the collar to look real.3rd: the white collar is quite big and does not fully come around the back of the neck.A real picture of the costume should be used, not one from the movie, I feel it's miss-leading."
2,not so hot!,We bought this Frank outfit for our little Pug for Halloween. The material is cheap and doesn't look very nice. It is thin and of poor quality-certainly not worth the money!
3,Not the picture,My wife had to alter the tux because it looked like crap when we recieved it. Don't buy unless you sew.
3,Wyatt Earp,I love History. Any sought of history of this world i love. The Earps are part of the history and is written about and had movies done on them. They were men who served as lawmen but also had there other side where they had dodgy dealings. They all had to make there money somehow. An interesting DVD.
1,Worthless POS,"This piece of junk is made out of PLASTIC and the handle flexes when crimping an RJ45 connector. The result is an incomplete crimp and contact terminals which protrude further than they should. If you're careful, you'll feel the resistance when trying to insert your incompletely crimped male RJ45 connector into your (possibly) expensive networking device and realize that something is wrong. If not, you might force it in and damage the wire contact terminals in the female connector of your expensive device. Save yourself some money (in the overall sense) and get a proper ratcheting tool made out of STEEL from Paladin, Ideal, etc. Also, consider staying away from Gardner Bender (ie. GB). They're tools are mostly junk."
4,Don't forget to retighten the screws from time to time,"This table has been holding up very well, and looks great, but the veneer is a bit sensitive to moisture, so it is not exactly great as a bar type table. Also, the screws need to be tightened up periodically. Otherwise it is not bad."
5,An excellent resource,This is a superb textbook. Where it surpasses the most widely known textbook in the field (Futuyma)is in its detailed listing of original source material after every chapter. This makes it an excellent springboard into serious background study for virtually any aspect of evolution or the topics surrounding evolution.
1,Terrible textbook for beginners,"I don't have a lot of science background but I had to take an evolution class that required this book. I was excited to learn about the subject but this book is not written for beginners. It is written for people who already have a strong background in science. For me, the book went way too deep into the different aspects of evolution and was downright confusing most of the time."
2,Slow and slower,This book starts out slowly and get slower. The characters are hard to keep separate. This very early effort by Mr. Hill (one of my favorite authors) was tough to finish. Only for VERY dedicated Hill fans (to be kind).
1,Black Opal Fade Cream,"I have been using Back Opal Fade Cream for 2 mos. now and it hasn't done a thing! I'm very disapointed because the reviews were so positive. I have very light skin, I used it on my face and arm area. I think 2 mos. is long enough to use it. I will not buy again!"
2,Not a good book for the Comptia Test,There is alot of information in this book but it is too general and broad for the Current Comptia Network + Test. Covers all of the areas generally speaking but it is missing the detail needed to pass the test. If you want to pass the current exam find a better book with more details.
4,Dated/slightly incomplete but allowed me to pass,"I used this pack to pass the exam today (May 22) on my first try. I received a score of 814 (need a 752 to pass) which is pretty good. I read the Exam prep text through once while highlighting what I thought was important. Than I went through my highlighting and created a ""cheat sheet"" which was 2 pages of the information I had to memorize. I memorized that information and then took the 2 exams included on the book CD ROM then the 4 exam cram tests. I was scoring about 73/75 on the book exam questions, on average. When I took it today I got an 814. So this method worked for me with these materials ONLY. It should be able to work for you =D. Best wishes!"
3,interesting...maybe?,"On the surface, a quite interesting and unique album. There's not another band I can think of that sounds like Jucifer, but in the end, is that saying very much? Low, fuzzy bass/drum grooves born of a cross between Black Sabbath and Public Enemy provide the background for the female vocalist, who drifts freely from whispers to screams, sometimes in rapid succesion. The downfalls? The lyrics are the usual indie-rock pigf**k atrocities, the drummer sometimes has serious difficulties keeping the tempo steady (which leads me to wonder why they kept the tracks), and a rather monochrome texture over the whole album makes it at times a tedious listen. In otherwords, Jucifer are only capable of doing one thing. It's not a bad thing, but you may not always be in the mood for it. By the way, the acoustic number on the album is a throwaway, and adds no variety. This is a curious, if essentially flawed record."
2,Hard to swallow,I was fooled by the title of this book thinking that I would find more direct information. Some of the recomendations found here are quite dangerous in the wrong hands. The advice that I found related to clearing of sinuses actually did more harm than good and I missed several days of work as a result. Use with caution.
5,Great book at a great price!,"Everybodys Knife Bible is a gem! As an Infantryman and former Ranger Instructor, I thought I knew everything there was about survival, but I was wrong. Don brings us to a time before computers and techno-wizard gadgetry and teaches us to use our knives the way they were meant to be used! From telling time to navigation, this book will enlighten even the most field worthy enthusiast! Don's wealth of experience and humor make this one of the most enjoyable knife books ever. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the great outdoors. I eagerly await your new book: Conquer Crime, Be Your Own Bodyguard. God bless you, Don Paul."
2,There's got to be something better,"After reading through this sloppily-printed, cliche-filled volume I didn't feel like I'd learned much. The author sees knives as tools of endless uses and suggests that the knife owner make any number of novel modifications to the owner's blades. The fact that no knife manufacturer offers any blade with these modifications already incorporated testifies to the value most people see in doing so.Practical information on knife selection and brands is lacking as is any substantive background in history or metallurgy."
5,Wouldn't have gone without it,"This book was our bible on our 10 day excursion to Isle Royale (royal like a king, not like royale with cheese). Coupled with a good topo map, we were able to get around the island with ease. Was also great for planning our route before the trip. This book tells you everything you need to know for a backpacking/fishing trip to this beautiful place."
5,Great,As always RH is a wonderfull story teller. Never short changes or lets one down in story or the thrills.
2,Weak,"Nothing new here. You'd be better off checking out bands like Edguy, Blind Guardian, Mago de Oz, or Gamma Ray. Vocals are especially uninspired."
1,Is this a joke?,"This is some of the worst 80s metal. I expected to hear some wild 80s guitar solos but no, the guitar work is lame and silly. At least anything you listen after this is better.: <"
4,An Excellent Introduction,"""How do you do, Herre Mozart?"" ""Verr Gut!"" This compilation serves as a fair sampler to what waits in store for those listeners who are moved by the music of W.A. Mozart. The recording starts off with a bang (Symphony No. 25 G minor, K183), then moves into the most delightful, tender serenade. With helpings of 'Don Giovanni', the great Requiem in D minor, K626 and, of course, other choice cuts; this album is worth exploring for the Mozart newcomer. Caveat Emptor: Mozart is even more than this album suggests."
3,He's much better live.,"The problem with this album is that it sounds *so* over produced compared to the way he sounds live. Live, he was fantastic. He had loop pedals and he would drum on his guitar, and loop it, and harmonize with himself, and loop it, and it was absolutely fantastic. So I bought the album and was pretty dissapointed. He simply doesn't have the same feeling in the studio. It sounds too set up."
5,Howie Rocks my world!,"I purchased this CD and Chris Brown's Pugs and Puppies recently. I listened to the Pugs and Puppies CD first, and was really dissapointed. The CD [was really bad], but then I listened to the Howie CD and it rocked! I no longer cared I had wasted my money on Pugs and Puppies. I strongly urge you to get this CD, it's the best and so is Howie, go see him live..."
5,Must Have!,"He is the only artist where i like every single song on all 7 of his albums. He is so talented. He gives a spectacular live show so go see him. his cd's include in order of release: Australia, Howie Day Live EP, The Madrigals EP, Stop All The World Now, Live From From EP, Sound The Alarm, Ceasefire."
4,Love it!,"Like many, I heard this after Day's second LP, Stop All The World Now. I love this album - every song. It's a bit more unpolished than the first album - but I'm not a purist - I don't see that as better or worse - it's just good, good stuff. I recommend this & all of his material. I haven't liked a new artist this much in years. I feel like an enthusiastic about music teenager again."
3,Just ok CD,"I bought this CD after I bought Stop all the World Now and compared to that album,well this one doesn't even compare."
2,Bastard child of Dave Matthews,"I only gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because of Howie Day's young age. Its hard for an artist not to sound like his idols when he hasn't been around long enough to see past them. This album is like a jam-less DMB album. From the strummed guitar to the way he sings, Dave Matthews dirty influence is all over this album. Its sad because he sounds like he has some talent waiting to rise above his influences. Also, the verse section of the last track sounds lifted from Radiohead circa OK Computer. Please Howie, grow beyond this album"
5,Blown Away,"Howie Day represents a great new sound. This album is filled with songs that will blow you away, ""Ghost"" is just one of the many. This song has great musical content and awesome rhythym change."
5,Howie Day is incredible!,"Howie Day is the most talented performer I have ever seen. His lyrics are amazing, and his voice is so powerful. The CD is a must have, but make sure to supplement it with a live performance."
5,"Yeah, Howie...","What can I say? Howie's the best. For those of you who know him, you probably already own Australia, so why are you reading this? Addicted, I know, me too. Those of you who don't know about Howie, well, you should! Buy Australia, it's not nearly as wonderful as Howie in concert, but it is great just the same. Australia barely peeks at his genius, but it's a good jumping off piont for those new to Howie's music. I promise you'll quickly move on to his live concerts."
5,no words can describe,"i've been downloading his music since late 99 early 2000, and i tell you what, he only gets better and even tho the songs are still the same then as now, they get better and have more meaning as you understand the words. this album is brilliant and so is his latest EP and his other songs not on the album including buzzing,madrigals and sweet. If i was to pick fav's on australia then i'd get Ghost, She Says and Morning After, just pure brilliance. When you find out that Ghost is all about a break (and not a good one) with a girl then the song has a didnt look and makes more sense and becomes even better! The album is a MUST for any music fan and if you think this is good, then you you'll blown away by his live stuff! He is a live performer and the songs become even better and it may be hard to believe but once you've heard the live versions the album doesnt compare. This is a true talent and a must buy and a must see! GET HIS Madrigals EP!"
1,Confusing and to much going on,"I didn't really have high hopes for ""Lady Liberty"" by Vicki Hinze, I didn't even buy the book, but since it landed in my bookcase, I thought that I would read it. I got to page 117 and I gave up. The book was confusing, there were so many characters that I couldn't keep them straight and the plot seem so silly. Who ever heard of the Vice-President of having a bomb on their arm! I sorry, but ""Lady Liberty"" to pass on."
5,More than I bargained for,For the price it is way more than I expected - bigger bottle - I adore the fragrance. Delivery spot on and early.

4,A review from a colleague,"While you can find many books today on world transformation, Operation Terra is in a class by itself. Here you'll find clear words, deep ideas, and an unusually broad view of human soul growth and the Earth's own path. Whether you are new to the field, or you have already read dozens of New Age books, I think you'll be impressed with this book. I strongly recommend it, and I know you'll be pleased it came your way."
5,How does it feel?,"To attempt to para-phrase the essence of the information contained within this book is daunting, to say the least. To suitably review these communications through words alone does not penetrate to the heart of this issue. The messages speak for themselves, but are not intended as a particular 'authority'. Rather, they have been projected with the express purpose of triggering recognition within the reader. This 'recognition' has to do with remembering that which is normally veiled from us.Many who read this material will instinctively recognize the unique opportunities that present themselves now. This book is profoundly inspiring and uplifting. The authors do not preach their message, nor do they attempt to influence in a certain fashion. Rather, they wish to gently sound the great bell of Creation . . . a universal frequency that is infinitely connected to the familial light that lives within our own hearts."
1,Beware,"There is something very wrong with these so-called prophecies. I get bad vibes from anything to do with these people. If you want my advice, stay away."
1,To lead you away from the truth,"Any of this type of reading should be regarded as dangerous for the soul. Channeling=New Age=Deception=Satanic. In the last days everyone shall be deceived. These beings are the ""Fallen Angels"" and are here to lead you away from the truth."
4,Getting Grey here and there.,"Works well with good results, and I think looks good. Is easy to apply when taking a shower. I recomend it for ease of use."
4,Sometimes love stinks..,"This was a cute film made no less precious by the addition of Richie Jen as a handsome gardner and Miriam Yeung as the princess with a problem-a peculiar affliction- she stinks. Yes there are the inevitable jokes about bad body odor, and some slapstick comedy revolving around the princess' suitors and a few inevitable fart jokes, but overall this comedy was quite fun and light-hearted. The perfect antidote to the insipid and insincere hollywood films.If you enjoy Chinese romantic comedy, this is a fun, light-hearted romp sure to amuse you."
1,okay for really light stuff,"I've had these on my wall for about 2 years now, finally going to replace them. As others have mentioned the plastic is very light weight and I am always concerned everything is going to come crashing down.... And with a slight accidental nudge of a tool you can watch everything come crashing to the floor. (only to curse yourself for still having these in your garage.)"
2,Fragile & Too Light Duty,"I had high hopes for this system and bought quite a few units for my garage. It unfortunately turns out that essentially hollow plastic is just not a good choice for the basic structure of this kind of thing. I have been using the system for some time now for common garden tools, but it just doesn't hold up over the long haul and I have several broken hook holders, hooks that are too loose in their plastic hinge pockets to adequately grip the handles of my tools, and general sagging. I am sorry I went with this approach and will likely tear it out and either go with something stronger or put in a DIY alternative sometime down the road."
3,Harrison Muzak,"I guess I expected more. This is most obviously a homemade CD-R. Don't expect packaging on the level of a legit release (did the Harrison estate even authorize this?).All quips about the packaging aside, what you will hear is Harrison's songs, in piano muzak form. This is solo piano pieces of some of George's songs. There are no vocals. Pleasant, but not essential. Only for completists.No doubt that Danny Colfax Mallon is a talented piano player, but don't take this release for more than it is: a simple, light tribute to some great songs. There are--belive me--plenty of WORSE Beatles tribute discs out there."
1,HARRISON TRIBUTE,NOT THE QUALITY AND MUSICAL INTEGRITY LAUDED BY SO CALLED EDITORIAL REVIEWS. SIMPLE PIANO MUZAK OF GEORGE HARRISON SONGS.PRICED TOO HIGH. IT'S A HOME MADE CD AND IT SHOWS .
2,case of mistaken identity...,"I remember watching this movie when it came out. I thought it was ok. Until I read Billie Holiday's Autobiography. Hence, the two stars. I'm not sure anyone would want to make a movie about what Lady Day went through back then. She was young when she lost her life. And I don't know how she managed to live so long, with what she had to live with in those days. Which is still known to exist today! God Bless. When are we going to wake up! Lady Day is the Greatest! She could sing without even trying. And when she didn't feel like it, she couldn't. She has the most beautiful voice I've heard. Read her book. It's a beautiful, sad story..."
1,Awful,This is the sickest film i have ever seen in my life. And it's nearly all pure fiction. Billie Holliday fans should avoid this all together and read the book instead. It was an insult to Billie's memory and amazing talent.
1,A gross insult,"This film is the biggest insult to the great Billie Holiday's memory. The producers may well have just dug up her grave and kicked her corpse. And to add insult to injury, they had to get Diana Ross with her itsy bitsy tinny voice to play and sing Holiday. For shame! They ought to remake the movie if only to set the record straight; and maybe get someone more authentic to play Billie Holiday. Someone like Corrine Bailey Rae maybe. Shame on Diana Ross for agreeing to play Billie Holiday. She obviously did not know herself then."
4,"Not Billie's real story, but I give Diana props","I'm not a Diana Ross fan, but in this movie, she was excellent and convincing as Lady Day. Dynamic performances by Billy Dee Williams and Richard Pryor as well. My only fault with this movie that it was not Billie Holiday's real story. It was supposedly based on William Dufty's bio of Billie's life, but I saw very few similarities between what I read in the Dufty book and what eventually came to the screen. ""Lady Sings The Blues"" is filled with inaccuracies and purely fictitious situations. Even Berry Gordy, Ross' one-time lover and mentor, admitted that the script was bogus, but it still was very riveting. This was Ross' first film and even though she never took a drama lesson in her life, she pulled this off with no problem. Definitely worth checking out."
5,Lady Sings The Blues,"I saw this film about ten years ago and thought the music was fantastic as well as Diana Ross's performane, I have the cassette but unfortunately cannot find anywhere in the UK where I can buy it"
5,A Classic Movie!,I love Lady Sings the Blues so much that I purchase it on DVD. This is my favorite all-time movie. The acting in this movie was excellent. Diana Ross did a excellent job. I'm going to give her mad props for playing the role of the late Billie Holiday. Don't forget about Billy Dee Williams and the late Richard Pryor part in this movie. They both did a excellent job too. Billy Dee Williams was a very handsome man back in the day and he's still is handsome today at a mature age. If you never seen Lady Sings the Blues before. You got to see this classic movie. You won't be disappointed!
3,"SO SO SCRIPT, GREAT ACTING","This is a grossly inaccurate account of the singer's life that totally ignores her recording career and almost makes it look like she struggled for success. In reality, she was signed to a recording contract when she was very young and made a lot of money. However, the performance of Diana Ross, in her first acting role, earned her a well-deserved Academy Award Nomination, she is brilliant. Richard Pryor and Billy Dee Williams also turn in solid performances. Overall, this is an entertaining movie about one of the greatest jazz and blues singers ever."
5,ROSS AT HER BEST!,"we fans of ms ROSS have been waiting a long time for this masterpiece,it,s finally here.RUN & GET it.leandro reggiani"
4,UnMissable Ross,"Why has this been essentially forgotten for 30 years? It's as good if not better than Coal Miner's Daughter or The Buddy Holly Story -- very well-written and directed. Yes, it glamorizes Billie and ,more significantly her man, but it really holds up as a film. It's odd this movie isn't held in higher regard.Diana is really amazing. No, she doesn't look like Billie. No, she doesn't sound like Billie, but watching it I felt she captured something essential. Why doesn't she get props for this? It's like if Usher suddenly gave the performance Jamie Foxx did in Ray. It's astonishing she never went on to have a big film career. Today, people talk about Dorothy Dandridge getting nominated more - for a musical where she didn't even do her own singing.The eerie thing about watching this. I kept thinking, ""Who does she remind me off?"" And then it hit me. ""Oh yeah, Michael."" It's all here. You can see the birth of the whole affect of Michael Jackson's various screen / video performances."
4,Excellent movie,"I am a big fan of Diana Ross and Billy D. Williams. This movie was both happy and sad, but all in all I loved watching those two fall in love and end up getting married. It was very touching!"
3,"Inaccurate, but the performances are powerful","The complex life of jazz singer Billie Holiday cannot be summed up in a two-and-a-half hour film unless it's a documentary. Therefore, LADY SINGS THE BLUES misses the boat in portraying Billie's life, but hits the target in casting Diana Ross, Billy Dee Williams and Richard Pryor. The chemistry between these three thespians are a joy to behold. And Ms. Ross sings Billie's songs very well without resorting to imitating the jazz legend."
5,A CD For Everyone,I like this cd because it's something on their for everybody.I really like the way he put the short clips in thereI think it's a good cd for someone who is a PRINCE fan.He is very close to sounding like him.I wish him well
4,Realistic tale about ordinary people. A sedative.,This book is a difficult one to contemplate.If you have any good material about this book. Please state it in your review. I am a student studying this book and would like to know more indepth information about it.
3,"Good Idea for Story, but lacking in creativity and ending","Kevin J. Anderson found a nice idea for a story but his writing at times is droll and not very exciting. Also, i thought Admiral Daala was kinda cliche and i didn't like her much at all. Gantoris and Kyp were both great characters but I don't think Luke was portrayed very well. For the most part the story was exciting-but as all stories Anderson seems to write-he doesn't know how to end the book. The ending is dumb and i could've written a better one. I would rate Kevin as the 4th best SW writer, probably. If you want to read a good series read the X-wing series written by Michael A. Stackpole and then read Tim Zahn. They are both great even if i like Stackpole a little better."
1,Desktop charger not charging,I've recently purchased this charger for my Treo. The order wasdelivered promptly but the charger won't charge my Treo. It was supposeto charge with AC adaptor (which was included) or with USB. Nither oneworked so I've send it back.
2,Evil? Not really.,"This was a trashy but entertaining read right up to the point where you find out that the ""evil"" thing Jon Pear and Madrigal have been doing is dropping kids off in the inner city, locking the car doors, and leaving them to ...... have rats crawl on them.Yeah. That's it. Ooh, scary! With the buildup to that scene, I was expecting something more on the level of a gang rape. At the very least, some threats and harassment by gang members. Maybe a mugging. Something, you know, threatening. I have to wonder if she had something more realistic originally, and the publisher made her take it out."
4,Twins,"I don't know why some people don't like this book. I read it right through non stop. I admitt it isn't the best book I've read, but if I was to suggest a book to a best friend I'd suggest this. It really thrills you in a way. A teenager's life has much pressure like Mary Lee's did, if you're an adult that is reading this you might not like it as much, but when a teenager is reading it we can actually feel it so realistic and relate to it."
3,It was pretty good,"It was ok but not great. You know what I mean? I mean don't get me wrong it was a pretty good book, but I think Cooney needed alot more infromation to make the book compelling. I loved her ""The Face On The Milk Carton"" and ""Whatever Happened To Janie"" because she got so intouch with the characters. If she would just have explained a little bit more of the character ""Mary Lee"" instead of what Mary Lee's view of her sister the book would have been alot better. Also if she didn't wright so much about boarding school that would also have been an improvment. This is what I beleve and if others feel different about it thats ok because a book is like art work it is only great to those who like it."
2,I expected better,"I was unpleasantly surprised by this book. Because I am a big fan of Conney's work, I expected much better than this. Although Cooney has proven many times that she has the ability to get inside of teenagers minds and portray them amazingly realistically, ""Twins"" sounds nothing like sixteen-year-olds at all. The characters didn't talk, act, or think like actual teens.Furthermore, ""Twins"" was a revoltingly typical horror story. Good versus Bad, Bad is killed, Good prevails. There are no plot twists, nothing that seperates this book from any of the other horror books in the world.I was disappointed in Caroline Cooney for presenting such an inacurate and typical story. While I would reccommend many of her books, I would advise you against reading this one."
2,Not Good enough for Ms. Cooney,"The plot of this book is so confusing & unrealistic. Two twins are separated by their parents. Mary Lee is sent to boarding school and Madrigal gets to stay home. Mary Lee thinks her sister is so great but she doesn't even really Know her5. Madrigal comes and visits and dies. But they switched places so everyone thinks Mary Lee died. This book was hard to follow and you really didn't understand why the characters did what they did. Like why Mary Lee didn't know about Madrigal's secret life even when they went to the same school? And why exactly did her parents decide to just suddenly separate the sisters? Ms. Cooney has written better. Read: the Face on the Milk Carton Series, Losing Christina books, etc."
4,Twins are separated when one is sent to boarding school.,"Mary Lee and Madrigal are twins who do every thing together until there parents decide they are too alike and need time apart. Mary Lee is sent to boarding school where she is miserable, while Madrigal stays at home where she becomes popular. Mary Lee wishes she could be Madrigal. Strangely she gets her wish and the plot unfolds from there."
2,UNREALISTIC,"This book was fun to read, but it really annoyed me because i am a twin and this book was so incredibly innaccurate about what being a twin is like, it was so unbelievable. It was interesting, and I enjoyed reading it, but i probly wont read it again. It just really annoyed me, because it was TOTALLY false and misrepresents what being a twin is all about...even though it was interesting to read about how she switched and pretended to be Madrigal, because that would be interesting to do with my sister, but we have switched places a few times before, and people can tell the difference between twins, especially really close friends, so that wasn't too realistic. i know that from experience, my sis and i got caught every time we switched. and also, the other characters, especially jon pear, were so bad too! i had no image of them in my head, and jon pear was so unrealistic and totally unbelievable. he was too evil. good characters should be more complicated, not just pure good or pure evil."
4,It was good,"It was a good story, but the thing that really bothered me was that the book didn't say anything romantic about Mary Lee and Van in the end. Something like a kiss, Ms. Cooney should of wrote something about that but she ended it by saying I am proud of being Mary Lee."
3,Too twee by far,"I have to disagree with the other reviewer; this book is just a bit too twee and light on the history to be useful. The story of Hannibal is a great one full of excitement, adventure and cunning--this book renders it as an inept copy of a Warner Bros. cartoon."
2,not what I expected,"I bought this item but I didnot like it, as it looks in the picture. It has very less space in the tummy area and it tends to sit low on the waist area. Also the flare is not as much as it should be in a regular gaucho, it looks like it is made by amature tailor."
1,Not able to return,I tried to return this product and the phone number was out of order and no one responded to my email. This is terrible customer service!
2,Mobility Saddlebag used on Jazzy power chair,The picture seems to make the bag look larger. I will use it until I purchase another one. It is fine fora few smaller items.
3,Just Okay,"I ordered this directly from Discount Ramps have to admit, I was disappointed when this came in. It looks nowhere near as nice the picture. It's a basic unlined nylon hook-and-loop closed bag with a couple extra pockets. If it were priced at $10.00, it might be worth it. It will do until I can get something better, though, so I'm keeping it."
1,READ THE FINE PRINT!!!!!,"The item shown is not the item you will receive. The item you will receive will be the 'classic' 8 sided espresso maker. Read the discription, because it does say the 'classic' 8 sided espresso maker. The photograph shows otherwise. Amazon get it right!!! Look for model V003-41810 to get the smooth round stainless steel in the 10 cup size."
2,"Great value, not so sturdy","This bench is OK, but the wood is lighter than teak. It looks good (and is a good value), but for a long bench I feel a little nervous when 3 adults are sitting on it. Spend the extra money and get a real teak bench and you'll feel like you're sitting on something a lot more solid."
5,Love the colors!,"Oddly enough, these are my favorite pens for grading papers. For some reasons students are more open to criticism when it comes in the form of sparkly green ink, rather than dull red ink - even the boys! Go figure."
5,Best Pens,These pens work great and the seller shipped them very quickly. Smooth writing and no issues with lack of ink. Very pretty colors and they add a nice spice for scrapbookers or just individuals who want to add some spice to journalling or jotting notes during a boring meeting.
3,product ok,Ink not always smooth. I'm not thrilled with this product. Some pens work better than others. Not really satisfied .
4,Very good,"Very good book, and in great condition, except that the first page was, well, not exactly a page, more like half a page.Shipping took very reasonable time, but pricewise... The book itself costs less than $2, but somehow the shipping costs over $12, sounds a bit... far fetched.All in all, I'm pleased, so thank you.Sivan"
2,Half Bad,This book was not so scary but it is not a worst book for me. All though i cannot really understand this book.
3,Got a head to spare?,"Stephanie and Duane love ghosts and scary stuff. Most of all they love the local ghost house. The attraction has guided tours that they join ever so often. Among their favourites is the story about the headless ghost that to this day still is looking for his head.One day they sneak off from the tour to explore the restricted areas of the house. Could there be ghosts there?The story is okay, the ending is sweet."
5,WOW!,"This book is about two kids, Duane and Stephanie, who visit a haunted house in order to solve the mystery of a ghost. This is by far the scariest Goosebump ive ever read. And Ive read almost every one in the originsl series."
3,Purcelled,"good read, realistic yarn about relationships in evolution. I was somewhat disappointed by the ending"
5,I AM A BELIEVER,Years ago I read Bob Barefoot's book and it made sense. I am a RN so I talked a lot of my patients into taking it. The reason I believe in Coral Calcium is because my Dad got bladder cancer around the year 2000. He had to have a cystoscope every 6 months and they would remove the cancerous lesions. This is a painful procedure and he had the procedure at least 3 times with cancerous lesions removed. So I suggested he start taking the Bob Barefoot brand of Coral Calcium. He took 2 pills a day for 4-6 months and when he returned for his 6 month cystoscope there was no cancer. The only new pill he was taking was the Coral Calcium. He told the Dr. about the pill and the Dr. said he didn't believe it but to keep taking it that it wouldn't hurt anything. My dad continued the pills and no cancer returned. He got so he only had to be checked once a year. So me & my husband started taking it. We only take 1 tablet a day but we have stayed in good health and we are in our 60's.
3,Not seeing a difference,"Months after seeing his program, I finally decided to search for these coral calcium supplements. Much to my dismay, I found a load of extremely similar products that looked rebranded or fake. I trusted reviews on this product and bought it. Was I wrong? Maybe.It's been nearly month now and I'm almost out of my supply.I have not noticed a change in my health after taking this product. I'm still getting pains, I don't feel more awake or energized, less stressed, blah blah. Maybe I need to take double the supplement amount due to my hyperthyroid, who knows.I don't really want to fork over $20 for another bottle to see if more time on it changes anything, especially not with all these rogue products on the market.If someone could leave a helpful comment about coral calcium supplement brands, it'd be appreciated."
3,"So far, so good....I guess!","I've been taking this product now for almost a month now as prescribed. To be honest, I don't notice any real changes. I don't know...does that mean that my body didn't need it? I may just stop taking them, to see if I notice anything. I also take Vit. D3 and C."
3,Product description in error,"Disappointed in the descriptive verbiage used to sell this product. I cannot assimilate hard tablets and did believed this product to be soft capsules. Tables were delivered and then could only return one of the two purchased bottles, since I opened one of the bottles. Be aware that these are tablets."
2,It's Crap,"i bought the camera, it has problems with the auto white balance and with opening (both problems developed ater 2 months of use). DO NOT BUY"
1,!!! Do Not Buy !!!,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this camera. What you see in the LCD or Viewfinder is not what you get on print or PC. I have taken pictures on the outside, with the sun shining and they come out dark. The digital zoom comes out blurred. It sounds like a good buy but it is not. Stay away from it."
1,Trash,"I bought this camera when it was greatly reduced and believed I was getting something with a high specification. In fact from the first photo I took there were problems with the contrast - outdoor photos were over-exposed, so it looked like everything was white, and indoor photos were all tinted navy-blue. After hours of adjusting settings and re-setting the camera I eventually took it back. However, this was not before I got through 6 fully charged batteries, as this machine just eats them."
4,"Good Pictures, Battery Hog","This camera takes excellent pictures, and the LCD screen to view them is also excellent with its crystal clear display! I find the on screen menu and options to be very helpful, and the one touch flash is pretty neat too, no seperate option it is on the same button as the snap button.The one problem I run into with this camera because the lense moves in and out it tends to use a ton of juice right away and when it goes in standby to deploy the lense. Other than quickly going through batteries (and they are rechargable) this camera is makes great pictures, and hold a ton too! I have yet to use the video mode, but that is why I have a camcorder isn't it?"
1,NO CAMERA,"I don't know if this is a good camera or not since Concord has never sent me a replacement for the one I received that did not work. They said it took one week to receive replacement. After repeated phone calls, they said they were ""repairing"" it and would send asap. This was after more than 3 weeks. They would not refund my money and finally agreed to send a new camera if I would pay shipping and handling ""again"" since I paid when I first ordered, when I shipped it back to be replaced, and now for the 3rd time to hopefully someday get a camera. Customer Service was not helpful at all - acted like they were doing me a favor to send me a new camera."
2,Good pics but poor in mechanics,"I bought the Concord at a reduced price and have taken some excellent pictures with it. Then problems occurred. The camera just stopped working. I sent it back to the company and got a replacement camera--without the memory card, which I had in the original. This is a small irritant but seemed sort of chintzy of Concord. Now, I have a camera full of pics in the internal memory that I cannot download using both the Concord-supplied software or any other. I keep getting the error message that there are no pics in the camera, yet I can click on to see the pics are stored inside. I'm very dissatisfied with this camera."
3,bath time crayons,Super fun in the tub but crayons fall out of the plastic holder. Crayons will also melt a bit in the tub. Easy to clean off and toddler loves it!But kinda messy if the crayon breaks and you end up with little pieces of melted crayon all over your tub.
2,Bathtime Crayons,The crayons were very small and they kept falling out of the seperate containers they were in. It was hard for my grand-daughter to play with them because they desolved so fast. But the company was very good to work with and I would order from them again.
2,Don't last as long as some other brands,These crayons are a little softer than some other brands of bath crayon. It seems like they disintegrate in the bath faster than other crayons we have had. A little disappointing overall.
2,Meh.,"I purchased these along with Munchkin and Crayola to compare the three. Out of the box, these were the loser due to the poor fit on the adjustment button. Upon further use, none of the colors transferred very well to any surface in the bath, including glass, enamel, or the acrylic surround. After wearing a few down trying to color, the business end kept coming lose and retracting back into the plastic handle, making the crayon all but useless after the tip gets used up. Based on a cost of about a dollar per crayon for nearly every brand, go with Crayola first, then Munchkin. Skip this one."
3,It's an okay toy,My nephew used these and they work okay. It's more like leaving marks on the tube walls instead of coloring. The marks wash off easily.
1,Horrible toy!!!,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas, thinking tub time would be fun I decided to give him his present early so I can see him use them! Thank god I did! Not only did the crayons stain my tub on wet surfaces they wouldnt work! Im trying to find new tub crayons for him but im kinda hesitant since this had a bad review! Dont waste your money!!!!!"
1,My kid destroyed these in 3 minutes,"Lovely concept but the fact is that this product is cheap. Although it looks like you can adjust the settings to push the additional crayon up, the little plastic thing doesn't hold and it collapses. This happened on every single color in the pack so its not a fluke. Also, it gives the impression that the mess is easy to clean up. NOT SO MUCH! Think twice before wasting your money on this."
4,crayons,"It has crayons. They are decent crayons. Not bad ones. You can use them to color. Thats that. Wooohoooo. Whatever the case, why not buy them you cant go wrong. As long as they are cheap"
2,Wanted to like these,"These wax portion of these crayons falls out of the plastic holder with virtually no provocation--rendering them pretty messy and useless (wet soap crayons are not fun & easy to hold barehanded), and it requires a fair amount of force on the part of a small child to make consistent marks with these. I've been through 3 sets of these, all given as gifts, and they all fell apart in the first usage. While my 21 month old loves to draw in the tub he won't be doing it with this brand now that we're done with the last package."
2,Disappointing,I purchased these as a santa stocking stuffer this year for my son. I was super excited to try them out and was completely disappointed by them. They only mark on DRY surfaces which renders them pretty much useless in a bath tub! The crayon also came out of the plastic tube in th first use. I would not recommend this item.
1,JUNK,Dont waste your money! Most crayons dont even draw and others fall apart. We usually buy CRAYOLA but I thought we would try these. BIG MISTAKE!!!
1,These are Junk compared to others...,"These crayons were for Christmas - stocking stuffer - for my 4 year old. We have had other bath crayons so I thought we would try some other types for fun. They fell apart immediately, the length mechanism would not function on most of them, they did now write well on the walls of the tub and when scrubbed off leave all types of floating residue in the water you have to wash off your child and also the rub...a pain all around. He used them for 2 minutes, I explained why Santa would leave such junk for 10 and then it took another 10 to clean out the tub. There are good ones out there so do not give up...try the star crayon in the tub. It does great - goes a little fast but we were able to take turns drawing items and discuss them over about 5 baths....so we are going back to them."
2,Very lame but a movie to just be curious about,"As we all know that Anna Nichole Smith has no acting talents. She is just good to be a model with large assets. Skyscraper was lame and so was the plot. I am suprised that this has a R version as much soft core porn is in this. I have to say it is a cult classic and will be a rare DVD film. If you need something to have a good laugh and if you have the mind set, this is the movie for you!! I gave it two stars because I actually like Ms. Smith in her reality TV series on E!"
1,NOTHING BUT THE BREAST,"SKYSCRAPER is in one word, awful. Anna Nicole Smith wouldn't know how to act, and once you've seen her watermelons once, they're not all that attractive. The two love scenes with the wimpy background songs are some of the worst ever put on celluloid. The acting is all around atrocious, especially Charles Hubere in the role of Fairfax, the Shakespeare spouting rastaman. When Anna spouts off to her cop husband, that she wants a baby, you just wanna stick a binkie in her mouth, but not one as big as hers or she'd gag.Which is just what one must do to survive this horrifying cinematic waste!"
2,Better than her other movie!,"In Anna's final movie (why?), she plays Carrie the helicopter pilot with fake fingernails. ""Skyscraper"" (1997) is directed by the same genius who brought us Anna's other blockbuster -1995's ""To The Limit"". Both movies are similar(wow, really?) in that Anna uses a gun, she gets naked a few times, and attempts to act too much. Oh yeah, there's also a really evil guy and a lot of explosions. If I must choose between the two for entertainment value, I'm going with Skyscraper. Not only does Anna have more nude scenes in this one, her acting (and everyone elses) is even more hilarious (if you actually watch it with sound!). Also there aren't as many long stretches of ""acting"" and ""explosions"". Bottom line, a laughably bad acted movie with breasts, guns, and things exploding. Enjoy!"
5,Annie Got A Gun,This movie is amazing if you are any kind of fan of ANS.This is perhaps the best performance of her entire acting career.The zooming in closeups of her aiming that mini canon are worththe entire price of admission alone -- and the cleavage is a bonus.
3,A Slapstick Pasty Movie!,I have yet to figure out the plot. Anna Nicole Smith did fine as long as she didn't talk. The terrorists were scary. That may have saved the movie. Good action scenes with entertaining gunfight scenes. I never did figure out what the terrorists were trying to obtain. Was it nuclear in nature? The terrorists never did issue demands. Perhaps they told Anna Nicole Smith and she forgot. Her nude scenes were entertaining because she had no lines. Perhaps she shpuld stick to nudie videos.
3,"Well, it has Anna Nicole Smith naked.","It has a terrible story line, but it has Anna Nicole Smith naked in two scenes. It rounds out nicely"
2,Minor League Mayhem,"I am in agreement with several of the other reviewers of this film. It was mostly awful. It didn't even have the saving grace of unintentional humor as in ""To The Limit."" A big disappointment was this mindblowingly erotic ""shower scene"" I've heard so much about... was that it? I've seen scenes between Miss Piggy and Kermit that were more exciting than that!In an offside, I find it interesting that they've allowed Smith to keep her thick southren (Texan?) accent. Usually Hollywood drills accents out of leading actors/actresses and make them speak ""normal"" English, leaving accents for various supporting roles. I wonder if this has had an effect on people's opinion of her acting. It may be that people are struggling with that very regional accent of hers."
1,Um......Yeah. this movie sucked.,I thik this movie could have been better. But I really didn't feel that my $2 was worth it. I expected alot more from Anna Nicole Smith. but that is ok. I think it would have been better if Anna actually knew how to act.
5,One Rocket Charlie!!!,"Skyscraper is a movie starring Anna Nicole Smith, and it co-stars her breasts. I must say that Ms. Smith should be jealous of her co-stars, as they get all of the good scenes, while sadly she must stand behind them and deliver her lines in a kind of stuper. Also the movie has a great villain, in the part of Zorkov, I think, who pummels every line he delivers like a blow to the skull...""CIAO BELLO!!!"" When Carrie the helicopter pilot is in the helicopter, look close as you can see the REAL pilots shoulder in some scenes when she is suppose to be alone. Anyway, it's been a while since I have seen this movie, but I do remember the strong parts, that is: lots or running, lots of screaming, tons of shooting, and of course, Anna Nicole Smiths huge naked breasts."
3,an anna nicole smith movie...,"This is more of a movie to watch with friends and laugh out loud because it's so bad(like her ""reality"" tv show).Also if you are attracted to the way Anna looks(or at least how she USED TO LOOK)then this movie will not disappoint. Lots of nudity..."
1,Hoooooooooooters.,"Ok, this movie is garbage. But Anna is simply smokin'. There are a few scenes in here that really show off how gOOrgeous this woman was. Its a shame she has left us."
1,0 stars,"Oh for the love of God! She wasflying the helicopter with nails longer than a tree bark and ones that had just been freshly manacured. Her body didn't look like she was exactly a ""lethal weapon"" as the reviews claimed. The dialouge was so stupid(except the bad guys) and The actors stunk!"
5,Lee Strobel Film Collection,"The Case for Christ, The Case for our Creator, The Case for Faith. These documentaries are truly amazing and great viewing with the family or to share with others. They make valid points and brings to light, the wondrous facts that are there for all to understand if they are seeking for God's truths."
5,Straight and to the pont,The movies explains things in a very basic amd clear way. It allows for your to take what information was shown to you and allows you to make you own decisions. The information provided is stuff you can research yourself to confirm its validaty. Gets the point across whether you like it or not.
5,"Lee Strobel 3 Disc The Case for Christ, Faith and Creator",Excellent series; very stimulating information and conversation with our women's bible study group! Great for group discussion and will change a non believers mind or at least get them to thinking real hard about their own beliefs.
4,Just as I ordered.,Lee does a good job of expressing his findings for his beliefs. He does an adequate job of presenting some evidence.
5,Documentary was great.,Great documentary. The man who made these documentaries was a journalist so he knew exactly who to go to to get reliable information on the life of Christ. Misinformation wont be found in this documnentary. I especially recommend A Case For Christ to any beleiver or skeptic.
5,Excellent trilogy,"Reading books is fine, but I liked this DVD set for it's impactfullness, its ability to hold me at the edge of my seat waiting for the next bit of information to add to my knowledge. I appreciated the fact that the DVD's included not only Lee Strobel, but also comments by his wife, and experts in their various fields. It is not only about one mans spiritual journey, but also comments from others, commenting on Strobel's personality changes. God still touches lives! For additional critical information on evolution, do a web search on 'chirality'."
4,"Well done, but not quite what I had expected.","I really liked this collection of films. I appreciate Lee Strobel's point of view and the journey he's taken from extreme skeptic to devout believer. I am somewhere in between the two. The films were well made and informative and were kind of documentary-esque... except that some of the 'scenes' were recreated and kind of cheesy. Also, the films overall themes and information overlapped quite a bit, which in some cases was helpful and in others kind of annoying and repetitive. All-in-all, I enjoyed them and would recommend them."
3,Didn't work in my datacenter,"I was hoping to use this to set up my Mac Mini as a rackmount server. The product did not fit my Mac Mini at all, and did not have the proper mount points for placing in a standard rackmount server. I give it 3 stars though, because it made tasty bacon. Mmmm, bacon."
2,Be careful,"This thing actually attaches to the door at the top of the backboard, meaning the hoop itself is about a foot below the door. That's good news for little kids, bad news for big kids!"
1,Dissappointed,I expected a stronger backdrop. i ordered this for my 20 month old son. It's flimsy and he pulls it off the wall.
3,Casina Truffle Salt,Don't like the taste of this at all. Seems seal was broken when I got it to because I could smell this stuff as soon as I opened the box. Not worth the money.
1,Not Qi Gong,"If you're looking for qi gong, this isn't it. Mr. Holden has lost his clear-eyed look and even attempts some awkward Hollywood-style smiling during the workout. It may be a good workout, but I'm not sure it has much to do with qi. I think his best qi gong video is the one for upper back and shoulders. It was done back when Mr Holden had that clear-eyed look typical of qi gong devotees."
1,DVD has dead spots that pause and won't play,"The Lee Holden Qi workout is great. However, the DVD I received is defective and has dead spots and pauses. Just a bad DVD I'm sure. I'd like to have it replaced. Thanks."
4,Qi workout,"I purchased primarily for the PM workout. I like it and find it helpful. I do wish it were a shorter workout, 40 minutes is a lot of time when I'm doing it as a finish to my regular 45 minute workout. I often skip some of the sequences."
5,symphony:Live in Vienna,I like her songs very much. Make me relax during I have bad mood.I received this product very fast and good package for shipping.
5,Absolutely lovely,From the beautiful cathedral to her performance everything is alsolutely lovely.I cannot wait to see her in person in concert next year.
5,"Beautiful Concert, Beautiful Sarah","I attended the Symphony concert in my town, 2nd row, and it was outstanding. As is this DVD/CD set. Sarah's voice brings tears to my eyes and I never tire of listening to her CD's over and over.Fernando Lima's voice with Sarah's is a perfect blend. Gorgeous couple on stage, I might add. My favorite song on the CD was ""Pasion"". I was disappointed with Chris Thompson singing the part of ""I will be with You"", and think Paul Stanley's voice is much much better. I did not like Chris singing in ""Phantom of the Opera"" either. Too raspy and rough. Spectacular location, videography, lighting, outfits! Sarah is awesome!"
5,Amazing!,It is amazing to see how Sarah improves with the times. There are no words to describe the emotions that she sends out with her voice and her music. I have been listening to other women that sing like her but there is only one Sarah Brightman and this concert is living proof of that!!It is great to see how she sings with other people and despite that all of them are great singers she is too far above all of them.Viva La Sarah!!!
2,Why is the AUDIO volume so poor?,"The visual is great, the orchestra superb but the singer's audio volume is very poor. Listener must strain to hear the singing. Was this a voice over production?"
2,not good,"I ordered the DVD and CD some time ago. After a while the DVD is not working any more, the CD id stil working. I enjoy lisening to the music which is woderful. The setting is very good and I enjoied while the DVD was working. I am not very pleased with the product."
1,WORTHLESS,I PURCHASED THIS BOOK TO DETERMINE THE CURRENT VALUE OF MY COLLECTION.THIS INFORMATION IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE IN THIS GUIDE (WAS AVAILABLE IN ALL PREVIOUS GUIDES- 2003-2004.THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN THE BOOK IS THE RETURN POLICY OF AMAZON AND THE SUPPLIER OF THIS BOOK. WE HAVE TRIED FOR AN HOUR ON THE INTERNET TO GET A PHYSICAL ADDRESS FOR THE SUPPLIER WHERE TO RETURN THIS BOOK. AMAZON WAS NO HELP AT ALL. WE WILL NOT BE DOING BUSINESS HERE ANYMORE.
2,Not a journal,"This tiny blank book with paperback cover is not appropriate for journaling. However, I loved it for jotting quick notes and things to remember while I'm out and about. It fits anywhere, including a jean pocket with no bulge to ruin the streamline effect and you can't beat the price."
4,"Junior Brown's first and some say, still best...read on","I first became acquainted with Mr. Brown onAustin City Limits, which at that time (in myarea of the good 'ole US of A was still showingacts worth watching (Webb Wilder, et, al). Iwas blown away watching plunk the strings onthat 'thang' he calls a 'Guit-Steel'! It's soCountry, it's well, Anti-Country! But just toprove he hasn't strayed too far from the farm,Junior has Jimmy Rogers original cut as thecloser. I loved it! Pick Up On It!"
4,Get with Guit With It!,"Saw Junior et. al. on Austin City Limits and was slightly mesmerized. Definitely different, Junior's an acquired taste, an antidote to the poisonous commercial country that streams out of Nashville these days. Based on the quality of his playing, Junior takes his music seriously, but songs like You're Wanted by the Police and My Wife Thinks Your Dead indicate that he's not taking things too seriously. Junior's having a good time and the world needs more Juniors."
