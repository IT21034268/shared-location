4,Loved Taylor since Las Vegas....,"I watched Taylor on American Idol and instantly fell in love with his style, his voice and his personality. I bought his Under the Radar CD and fell in love with his music. I anxiously awaited his first CD. Although I thought that the songs would be more of a throw back to Ray, Sam and Otis, that was not the case. HOWEVER, I still like most of the songs on the CD.I didn't give it 5 stars because of remake of Soul Thing. It is one of my favorite songs on the Under The Radar CD. The remake...not so much.I was also disappointed to see no mention of the Soul Patrol. I'm sure it was just a slight overlook because Taylor doesn't seem like the kind of person who would not continue to recognize those who stood behind him and continued to vote for him while he was being verbally pummelled by one of the judges.Still..it's a great CD.."
3,"Taylor's voice, but not his soul.","The name ""Taylor"" and the word ""pop"" shouldn't be in the same sentence unless there's soda involved. He's not a pop artist, he's a blues & soul man, and that's who people fell in love with. It seems to me that this album is an obligation album, and his independent albums will be more of what we expect.Taylor's voice belongs to a real band with real instruments... not mixers and synthesizers. Real instruments would have made a lot of difference to this CD.I bought Taylor's original CD before he was overwhelmed with Idol success and I beleive he'll get to go back to his soul-speaking ways soon enough. In the mean time, fans who want to pretend the stars are singing about them in their lyrics will appreciate this CD, but the rest of us who just appreciate Taylor's music (hopping jaw harp and all) will be looking forward to the rhythm in the next one."
3,"Grows on you, but expected much more","I am still a Taylor fan. I think he has such a nice voice. While some of the songs can really grow on you, I expected the CD to be a lot better than it was. I don't blame him though, I think they just tried to make him sound too pop."
1,Do your research first!,I would highly recommend doing further research before buying -- virtually everything I have read on this comes from unhappy customers who say they never received anything of value. Check out all the reviews available on Amazon for the 2 and 3 year versions of extended warranties before making a decision.
2,Still no contract received,"Purchased the contract on 6/23/09. Followed up 30 days later and they said it was mailed to an old address and they would mail another. Pended for 30 days. Followed up August...they would mail another. Followed up in September..they claim there were 2 requests pending, they confirmed my mailing address and assured me it would be mailed.To date (10/1/09)...no contract. Maybe a non-issue as they say I'm covered, but will I get the same run-around when I have a claim?"
2,OK for a product you're not confident with.,"Try to become confident of your product before buying. An expensive way to assist with your purchase for possible problem items. Sort of like life insurance, you hope you don't need it."
1,Disappointed,"Very commercial - not what I had hoped! His voice is great, but the production of this CD was a real disappointment."
3,"Love the watch, love my team, but it was overpriced","It's a pretty, inexpensive watch (I don't accessorize much, but I do love my watches), but I found the identical item for $10 at Wal-Mart. Was a little disappointed to find I had been gouged (I paid $39). Watch works fine though."
3,"Nice face, band could be better",The face of this watch is really nice but the band ruins overall appearance. The band was very stiff and had black marks on it which would not come off. Would have kept it if it had a nice white leather band or if it was a bangle band.
3,Watch,"My daughter loved the watch......but it wasn't much fun on Christmas morning when she opened it and the battery was dead. There was no protective piece slipped in behind the watch stem to keep the watch from running...hence the dead battery. So we had to go out and by a new battery for a ""new"" watch!!!"
1,Very Disappointing,I bought this watch to give as a gift. It arrived at my home yesterday (the 2 day shipping was actually only 1 day....good service there). It looks cheap and very large for a Woman's watch. Unfortunately I don't have time to order a different one/get a different gift in time for my friend's birthday.
5,Looks good,"Haven't gotten that far yet, but it looks like a quality product. More later if needed. Service was good."
3,Would have been great if it came as advertised,"Ordered and received a Sigg Big Kids water bottle, but it did not come as shown with the flip top lid. It came with the loop, which would have been fine, except I already ordered a loop lid for it, so they would have both. The Hello Kitty Sigg that I ordered from another seller came exactly as shown. I am disappointed and have no way to contact Amazon other than sending back the whole item."
3,Not particularly durable,"We have 4 Siggs- 2 adult and 2 kids. They really do protect the taste of your water- nothing like drinking out of a nalgene bottle. However, all of ours have dented severely after just a few days of pretty light use. We haven't even used them hiking yet. I can't see these bottles lasting more than a few seasons."
4,Great for older kids.,"I agree with some of the other reviews. I bought this bottle because I was concerned about my kids drinking from plastic all the time. Pros: it's not plastic and it holds plenty of water for my 3-year-old. Cons: it's expensive, it dents easily, and if my 1-year-old gets his hands on it, the bottle's contents will be all over the floor. I see that they have a Sigg bottle for babies, but I would not recommend giving this bottle to a baby, since it has no valve or anything to keep water from freely flowing out of it.Because of the price, we only use our Sigg bottles at the house, and still take the plastic ones with us when we go out. I'd rather lose one that costs $3 than a bottle that costs almost $20!"
2,..All Their Hits..?,"..And Much More ?..They had almost 3 hits..The rest is..Ehh.filler.Lead Len Barry went solo and was a ""One Hit Wonder"" with 1-2-3..Even the used price here is crazy..Hardly a career..!..You can have mine..!"
1,Season Three - 2 VOLUMES ???????????,"I enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2, and was ready to order Season 3 until I saw it was in TWO VOLUMES. You have to be kidding!!!!! In these days of Netflix, they are cutting their own throats. Judging from the other comments, I and others will wait ten years before we will pay for two volumes of the same season."
3,"great show, distributed it poorly by USA","The Show is wonderful. You would think that USA would learn from others. The split season was tried earlier by the releasers of Touched by An Angel, My three Sons and others. It didn't work for the other shows, why do they think it will work for them. USA get it together and release Royal Pains as complete seasons."
2,"Unfocused This Season, Imploding","I've enjoyed watching this show for three seasons but this third season is problematic. Hank and his cohorts are all over the map. Also, the medical conditions are getting more and more bizarre. This episode of the man passing out every time he gets in front of his new painting is a case in point. The answer became so complicated that I began to lose interest. This is also what is happening with the characters' lives. Plus there are now way too many characters and plotlines. Someone needs to put on the brakes with this series before it implodes,"
2,Save the mumbo jumbo affirmation....,"The only reason this gets 2 stars from me is because it does indeed cause a good sweat. However, with all the positive reinforcement and self-affirmation I was wondering if I was even listening to an exerise dvd. I want to ride, and get a great workout on my spin bike. I don't need the existential motivation to get me up that hill...just tell me to stand up and turn it up and leave me to figure out my own direction in life. I'm already in a good place, I just want some kickin' music and a little direction to get me in the groove on my spin bike. Jeez, I felt like I was at a couple's retreat for spin therapy. Bleech...Seems all the Spinning DVDs follow Johnny G's pattern of gay (I mean happy!) riding to overcome life's challenges. Dude, I just want to ride and sweat without the sweet nothings throughout.... Who can recommend something like I get in a good NYC Crunch Spin Class?"
1,BAD-CHEESY,"My husband and I have been in spin classes for about a year, decided to buy a spin bike so we could work out at home. We looked on line at videos and selected Johnny G's video. Five minutes into the video my husband said that he would not watch this again. Johnny G. is more interested in listening to himself than he is in the participants in the spin class. The music is terrible, it's all the same. This video is cheesy!!! WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO. If we could get our money back we would."
5,A 'must' for any who regularly tackle woodworking projects,"Andy Rae's Taunton's Complete Illustrated Guide To Working With Wood is a 'must' for any who regularly tackle woodworking projects. A step-by-step reference covers different techniques for working with the wood, packing in nearly a thousand photos and drawings to show how to buy lumber, dry it, store it, join it, and machine it. Andy Rae has his own woodworking business and designs his own furniture; his extensive background making furniture and teaching woodworking lends to a splendidly simple presentation outlining different wood qualities and how to work with them."
3,Routine Journo book on a acquisition,"Having been involved in several US acquisitions, this books seems tame. Maybe by Japanese standards the book is an eye-opener, but frankly I was bored reading it. Spicing it up with a few suicides was interesting--so maybe in JP a merger like this was radical--but I doubt it (JP has a high suicide rate anyway).Of interest to me was how in the US shares and M&A fees are used as legal bribes for crony capitalism (Goldman Sachs et al), while in JP bank loans are used to the same purpose. It reflects the shares/loans mentality between the US and JP/Germany. Other than that, routine."
4,Fair Price,"The order came as described, the only thing I didn't like was that it came with the price sticker on the book, not on a plastic cover; wouldn't have been good if it was a gift."
4,A must read for all CEOs!,"Tett did a great job in writing this book. Collins, Flowers, Yashiro, Reed, Volker, Onogi, Jordan, Summers, Rockefeller.... read like a list of who's who in Global Finance.... It is a page turner. Ripplewood bought the bankrupt LTCB Japanese bank and turned it around. It serves as a blueprint for US and global investors. Tim Collins started this venture but there was little mention about his contribution in the later part of the book. The ending seems too short.Ripplewood Holding is traded on the stock market after Tim Collins raised $1 billion in IPO, the stock symbol is RHJIF, about $27 per share. This is a stock of a combination of Japanese firms. Will you buy it???"
1,Don't give your money to narcs.,"Ever wonder why Pickard and Skinner got busted? It's because of this troll Krystle Cole. To add insult to injury, she has the audacity to barely cobble together a book, then tries to pass it off as something worthwhile, when in fact it is a complete waste of time, no matter how you look at it. If looking for information on psychedelics, this is not the book for you. If interested in the details of the Pickard/Skinner bust, you'll still want to look elsewhere. You'll never get the real story from NeuroSoup.Reviewing your own piece of journalistic pulp is totally classless."
2,Strange life the Author led,"I was very curious to read this book. I had met the Author in the past, Only once though. She seemed to be quiet and shy.Personally , this book left me with a lot of questions.I found it to be many things. Sad would be just one description. To think that people actually do and create these drugs is totally beyond my comprehension.Proof that lives are destroyed. Born are weird beliefs and spiritual thoughts. AS a Christian, I stand in pure shock."
1,Waste Of Time And Money!,"Poorly written, amateurish, and incomprehensible! Stick with Strassman, Grof, McKenna, Shulgin, Oroc, and the rest. About as enjoyable and informative to read as a (C-) middle school essay. The author's website and youtube postings are no better (stick with Erowid). A total disappointment. The events ""described"" should be very interesting, but the author leaves you wondering WTF happened and why. The ""kidnapping"" is totally baffling; I had to do a google search to find out what really happened. A very childish failed attempt to be in the same league as the authors mentioned above. If Leonard Pickard wrote a book, it would be worth reading, but this is worthless. A total embarrasment. (I find it very disturbing and unethical when an author ""reviews"" their own book, giving it a 5 star rating!)"
4,Great Gadget,"I'm an English-second-language instructor, and one of my students bought a reading pen so she could efficiently get word definitions and pronunications.The pen works fine, but in learning to use it, rely on your own experimenting more than by reading the owner's manual. One trick I accidentally figured out (that is not described in the manual) gets the pen to read an entire sentence without the need for your prompts between each word. Here's how to do it: 1) have the pen read the sentence from right to left, 2) press ESC, 3) press left arrow key.It's a fun product, and seems to work reliably so far."
3,"Good, but not Rick West's best","I think I disliked this album for the same reasons the previous reviewer liked it. It wasn't the same Rick West I'm used to hearing. That's probably good for some, but I'm an old school fart, stuck in my stubborn ways. Flavored Beats 3 was the all-time best (for you old school folks)!"
2,Easy reading but not much in content,This book may be a good inspiration but it doesn't help much in terms of business start-up procedures. The tips given by the author are too commonsense. Not recommended for people who already have some knowledge in business. The tips are already so understandable that I feel like I'm wasting my time reading the explaination. Not broad enough for people interested in the fields other than media &advertising.
4,It's a horrible shame that this is out of print...,"... or it would be another of the books on my permanent gift-giving list.Reading this book is like rummaging through the proverbial attic. It's full of dusty, shabby notions that seem dated, broken, and discredited; what seemed enlightened in 1920 is disturbingly racist now, for example, and the veiled denunciations of Aleister Crowley are valuable only as historical curiosities.But in the dusty clutter, there are occasional treasures of inestimable value. Dion Fortune expressed, possibly better than any writer I've ever encountered, the extent to which mystical experience relies on the tension between the literal and the metaphorical. Buried in the middle of this book is an allegorical passage as deep and expressive as Plato's cave.If you can find this anywhere, it's worth the search."
5,Talkin' to Myself: Blues Lyrics,"If you like the Blues, you'll like this book. It's full of lyrics from days gone by. A real plus for your musicians library! A+++"
3,history lesson,"A very interesting history lesson. There were some good recipies, but most were hard to follow. Book two gets to sit on the bookshelf, all it is are the old untranslated recipies that you get to work out for yourself. Another thing you have to remember, is that medieval people were more often then not on lent, which ment no meat. And their palates were quite different. Which means that most of these recipies would probably make you sick just smelling them."
4,Good basic LCD,"I bought this as a demo, so felt pretty good about the price to start. However, I was more than pleased with myself as I realized that the monitor features a portrait mode capabilty and free software to make it work. Web browsing in Portrait, and doing word processing, it nicer than other monitors. I get the sense that this is a very decent monitor, but not the tops because it lacks a DVI connector and the brightness is a little on the low side."
2,Li-ion battery,I didn't get much more cell phone time using this battery than the one I replaced. I didn't return it because it didn't seem worth the trouble. I now have a new cell phone and get several times more minutes than on the cell phone with the battery I purchased.
4,Olympus is King,"This is my first digital camera. I have been waiting for a great deal on a 2+ MP camera. Amazon had it. The camera is great. I take it everywhere and have started to publish pictures on my web site.The only drawback seems to be the battery life. I went to Radio Shack and invested in 4 rechargables. This has done the trick.For [money], you can not do wrong. Upgrade the 128 card and you are set.Pleased in NJ"
4,How long the Rechargable Or Lithium Batteries withstand ?,"As per all the customer reviews, it seems that Alkaline batteries are not useful for this digital camera . Can any one tell me how long Lithium or Rechargable batteries able to withstand with this cameras ? Bec i am planning to buy this camera , it will be very useful for me.Shyam Prasad"
5,Just excelent,It is my first digital camera but i have friends with very expensive cameras ($3000+). So I spent a lot of time reading reviews and consulting my friends. I've chosen this one and did never regrett it!1. color balance is excelent2. with NiMh battaries (1700Mh) I make more then 50-70 shots with display and flash.3. the picture itseft is very sharpLook at my pictures I took with D-230.They were made with full auto modeI made NO changes on computer!...
4,Great Inexpensive Camera,"Very easy to use. Great picture quality.Built in lens cover. Small physical size.Would have given it 5 stars if it also hadoptical zoom.NOTE: All digital cameras burn up alkalinebatteries faster than you can say cheese,this is not a flaw in the camera, it is acomplaint voiced by those who have done noresearch prior to purchasing a digital camera.I am very happy with the camera.Also purchased 4 NiMH batteries and a 64MBsmartcard which will hold about 120 hi-respics..."
2,Dont Waste Your Time or Money,"i ordered the olympus d230 from amazon...when i opened the box, the camera had a blue blotch on the lcd display. although this has nothing to do with the cameras quality, let me go on, please.i very quickly found out the difference between digital zoom and optical zoom (which the camera does not have-optical). OPTICAL IS BETTER. digital only enlarges the picture which really makes the quality poorer. the body of the camera is flimsy and feels as if it will break easily. the batteries included in the box you say, dont last 10 minutes!!!! the lag time between pictures is about 3 seconds which [stinks] (and i am a first time user who isnt that picky, honest). the memory card was ok, 16mb. the options were poorly constructed.i returned the camera the very NEXT day. one GOOD thing is that the return procedure was VERY simple.overall, this is a camera i would buy for my 13yr. old brother. not for an adult."
4,Nice Camera,"This camera is a great camera for the price. Just set yourself up right with re-chargeable batteries, or lithium. The alkaline are ridiculous."
3,Not a best choice for this price,"... Compared to the Fuji camera, Olympus Brio D-230 is not a good one. The picture quality is not very good, especially when you take photos in not very bright environment. However, the pictures taken by Fuji are very good and real. The digital zoom is not a good choice either. Another bad property of this camera is its low battery life.I returned this item because it didn't meet my expection."
5,Great little digital camera,"This is a nice small camera, not the smallest but a nice size. It only needs two batteries. What you need to do is get a battery charger and some NiMN batteries, and you won't need to buy batteries all the time."
5,Great feature to size ratio,I really love my Olympus Brio D-230. It is small enough to fit in my purse and does everything I would expect. I took it on a cruise and my pictures came out GREAT!
4,Great first digital camera,The camera has many easy to use features and is great for sharing Email pictures. Eats up batteries quickly but with a charger and Ni-MH rechargable batteries the problem is solved.
2,I was really disapointed...,"Well, I wish I could say that I absolutely loved this CD and listen to it all the time, but I can't. When I ordered this CD I was so excited, because I really do appreciate everything Alanis Morissette does. I'd heard a few of her songs on the radio once or twice and loved them.Ok well here is the problem I have with it: All of the lyrics in each of the songs seem to be so negative. I never noticed it before I bought the CD but once I owned the CD and listened to each song a few times in a row I realized that they are all about something negative. Or at least most of them are. I am the type of person who appreciates meaningful lyrics, but these are not meaningful to me. They are all a bit depressing, really. I love Alanis' voice and I think it is very uniquely beautiful, but I am just disappointed in what she is singing ABOUT. It's not the worst I've come across, but I really wouldn't recommend buying this CD unless you are into the depressing, angry lyrics.~Peace out~"
3,Not much new,I have her other albums and was a little disappointed that there were only a couple new songs. The rest were just copies from previous works.
2,"do yourself a favor, don't buy it","Being an Alanis fan, or a former one, I recommend you not to buy this album if you have already purchased her previous ones. Basically the album contains the exact same songs in the previous albums; i thought she would revisit some songs and make new versions of them, which didn't happen. So, do yourself a favor: don't waste your money.As for the DVD, it is the only good thing about purchasing this. But still, it is not worth the money.Bad career choice, Alanis."
1,What's the point ?,"Right, I'll make this short : compilations should be illegal, it's really not nice trying to make us pay for a whole cd when there's only one or two tunes that aren't already on the original albums. And don't go telling me I can just download the mp3 from the internet, you'll really piss me off, or I'll have to start telling you about decent packaging and authentic hifi quality... Just can't be bothered. I have every original cd of Alanis', but this time I'll pass, I can make my own compilation and it won't cost me a dime. God how I hate these money making times we live in !! Alanis, I'm a little disappointed..."
4,Great Collection - but not at all extensive enough,"I must admit that this album picks up some of Alanis' many 'greatest hits'. Yet, although the album is called the Collection, I was again dissapointed that there was not even a nod to Alanis' first two albums. The ommision of her early 90s pop single - ""Too Hot"" makes this album more a mix tape of singles rather than a true Anthology-type greatest hits album.Mind you, there are many years to come along with many more great songs for Alanis to add to her canon. I can't wait to see a greatest hits cd 20 years down the line."
5,Rockin',This was one of my favorite CD's in Highschool and it was lost or stolen and I have been trying to duplicate it by making burned Cd's for years trying to get all the songs I enjoyed. This Cd is awesome and in great condition. I love it and am rockin' out to in now.
3,"I Don't Have This Record, But I Have Created My Own Best Of Album",1) You Oughta Known2) Hand In My Pocket3) Ironic4) You Learn5) Head Over Feet6) All I Really Want7) Right Through You8) Thank U9) So Pure10) Would Not Come11) Uninvited12) Hands Clean13) Precious Illusions14) Everything15) Out Is Through16) Eight Easy Steps17) Crazy18) Right Through You - Acoustic Version19) Your House - Acoustic Version20) You Oughta Know - Acoustic Version
1,Read to see why,"The reason I am giving this one star is because the hit, huge hit if I might add ""All I Really Want"" was left off. I remember buying this in the 90's and that song was all over the radio. It's also a great song. I don't understand why in the world they left it off. It's her best song. It's funny how you can go to i-tunes and type in Jagged Little Pill and all the kids download the five singles from this album, but not ""All I Really Want"" showing you they weren't around at the time to see how big that song was. They only look at this collection and take the five songs from Jagged Little Pill and download them."
4,Good Collection,This is a good collection of all of her music to date. No hits seem to be missing on this one.
4,Good collection,"This is the only place you can get the song ""Crazy"" (except for the CD single of the same name), the Seal cover that Alanis has openly named her ""favorite song ever"". If you buy it on iTunes, you can also get the ORIGINAL version of the song, the Tony Kanal mix (the version on the CD is the James Michaels mix that was released to radio)."
5,good artists not very good track listing,"I am a huge Alanis fan from Turkey and I ordered the limited edition so I will receive ""the collection"" on december. But as I know all of her songs I can write a goosd review. First I like to start with the cover. It is very well designed. There is a lack of new stuff (mercy and crazy are not enough. there should be at least 2 previously unreleased songs). And I think track listing is not well organised. The songs chosen from ""Jagged Little Pill"" are okay but choices from the other albums are just not good enough to be in ther collection. I would choos ""a man"" ""fear of bliss"" ""excuses"" and ""no pressure over cappucino"" instead of ""simple together"", ""so unsexy"" and ""sister blister"". I would give 5 stars to everything that Alanis made but I think buying the limited edition would be a better choice since you get a DVD and a 16-page-booklet."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!,"What else could you expect from Alanis!!??This album is full of great songs, I consider myself Alanis' biggest fan, I have every single one of her albums, which means I already know every song on 'The Collection', but it seems very convenient to have the bestest of her songs all in one album. I LOVE IT!!"
5,A Strange Collection...,"The Collection by Alanis Morissette is a weird batch of songs. I don't really find it to be the best representation of her, and it certainly is NOT a greatest hits package. And yet... it works that way. It is a bizarre, yet intriguing grab bag of Alanis songs that defies any category: Not singles, not rarities. I would only suggest this for somebody who is already a fan (better yet, the special edition, which has an excellent DVD). A ""beginner"" fan should buy Jagged Little Pill first, and then all of the rest in order. This is really good for those fans, like myself, who love Alanis but refuse to buy The City of Angels soundtrack (for instance) for one song."
4,"The Real ""Q""","The Real ""Q""Clayton Hutton's ""Official Secret: The Incredible story of Escape Aids Used During World War II"" is the account of the research and development program in England to produce aids, devices, and equipment that could be hidden or disguised for the purpose of assisting in escape and evasion. The discusses the aids designed and made in quantity for general issue included compasses of all sizes; some disguised as uniform buttons; silk maps, dart guns, boots with hidden compartments, emergency rations and many more bizarre items that would impress ""Q"" from James Bond."
2,Disappointing,"Not quite what I expected, and I would be hard-pressed to recommend this book (especially given what it costs, now way-out-of-print). Not very well written; tries to settle ""too many scores""; and is light on the gadgets of real interest. A much better choice in this genre is Nicholas Rankin's ""A Genius for Deception"" (2008), or, if you are into code breaking, David Kahn's ""The Code Breakers"" (1996)."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this from Circuit City today and it's going back tomorrow. The speaker quality is fair (not good, but not too bad), however the whole unit vibrates and jumps off the desk when you turn it up loud enough to not be right next to it (i.e., use it as a speakerphone!). The microphone is TERRIBLE and unusable. It is distorted and too quiet. When you turn up the level on the computer, you get an echo. No wonder the MSRP is $50 and everyone (Circuit City, Amazon, ...) is trying to get rid of them for $20."
1,worst microphone ever!,"This was on sale really cheap so I decided to get it because it looked neat and I figured it couldn't be that bad. As other reviewers have noted, the speaker on it isn't too bad but the microphone is completely unusable and this setup is worse than just using the built-in microphone on my laptop."
1,Worthless,This speakerphone is worthless. It provides no echo cancellation and has a very under powered speaker that produces distortion at moderate volume levels. I returned it.
2,Use with game consoles...,"The Xbox 360 does not recognize this device.This device is fully functional with the PS3, but it is very quiet. Too quiet. Unless you're gaming in silence, this will likely be as unusable to you, as it was with me. I don't plan on returning it because it was inexpensive and return shipping would cost more than I paid for it.Side note: The speaker looks very cheap. I'll try to take some pictures later."
3,"Volume 2 of a ""best of"" series, i take it","This is merely a collection of some of the episodes involving our famed young vampire. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a continuation of the series from its beginning. That would be the ""Dark Shadows Collector's Volume 2"". Certainly this series should be recommended, but any ""best of"" tape should never be given volume numbers when the whole series has the same titles. Sheesh. My mistake."
4,Great toy but quite small,"This was given as a gift and much loved by its recipient, but I was a little surprised at the size - despite the 12 inch tag, it looks smaller than the photos make it appear. Very cute though, and hard wearing."
4,good for the person cannot pitch for your kid,"I bought this item for my sister having a daughter who plays softball in junior high. My sister never played any sports and doesn't know how to pitch. But she wants to practice softball with her kid. So I gave it to her. And she likes it. She doesn't have to throw the ball to her daughter for batting. She doesn't have to run to get a ball. But in my opinion, This item is not for the high level ball players."
2,Broke within the first two days,"Don't get me wrong, the concept of the Zip and Hit is fantastic, but the quality wasn't there, it says for use with before and up to major leagues. i don't even play baseball so my swing isn't that strong, so it wasn't me... vie only had the product for a week and we have had to buy a metal clasp ( the plastic broke), the rope ( both the set rope and replacement broke), and the ball broke.... note again we have had this for a week and use it maybe have used it for a total of 3.5 hours. i hope you send me a refund , i am a consistent buyer here on amazon.com, in the past 2 months i have bought about 6 items for a total of 70 bucks, and i don't want to stop"
1,"Nicely promoted and packaged, product broken within an hour","A part of the baseball broke after the first hit, the string broke after 3 batters. I should have been suspicious seeing the spare set of strings. Definitely not for adults, may last 5 kids."
2,Don't overuse it,"My son hit .515 as an 8 year old last year. This year, he moved up a division and has struggled at around .250, even though he has a fairly nice swing. Using this device for two weeks, he suddenly can't hit anything. I pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60! The problem with this device is that the ball doesn't drop like a pitched ball, so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal. I'll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son's swing and confidence. Don't get me wrong, the kids love it. The entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it. It's great for use around the house - just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you couldn't otherwise. Beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and don't let it replace live pitching. Fun-factor is a 5, but as far as a training device, I have to question its value."
4,Zip & Hit Durability,"Durability seems to be an issue. The cord breaks or unravels much too quickly. The sleeve inside the ball becomes grooved and slows the ball's travel on the cord. A sleeve made of a harder, slicker material would improve both ball speed and reduce cord wear. Possible materials are hardened aluminum, stainless steel (polished), teflon-based plastic or polycarbonate."
4,A GOOD HISTORICAL NOVEL,"I really liked this novel. It was well written and It's about the conspiracy theory of Aaron Burr against Jefferson. It was a little long but well worth the reading time. A must for history buffs. It also mentions about Adams, James, and Dolley Madison, the Louisiana Purchase as well as the trial and other historical figures. I would rate it 4.5 stars."
4,just what i needed to sell my car,"bought this set to replace the 2 missing ones on my car before I sold it. The buyer never noticed that the 2 on the right weren't the same as the 2 on the left, but then again, they look great on the car. great price too."
3,Nice looking but a bit flimsy,"These look really nice on my 98 Camry. Gives it a bit of an updated look, and certainly at a good price. Just be warned that they are pretty flimsy. One of them cracked on me without much force when putting it on the wheel. So overall - they are better looking than the factory hubcaps but are not nearly as sturdy."
4,a fine replacement.,"I have a 2004 toyota camry..the wheel covers from toyota are 73.47 ea. the price is way too high..and they realy don;t look that good..the 15"" wheels from drive accessories are easy to clean..they cover the rims the way I like..oh!and under 30.00 is nice for a set of four..I am pleased with both the fit and finish..I only hope the Co. keep making this type of after market wheel cover.thanks.p.spivey"
5,Looks great,"Looks good on a 2000 camry. Isn't too flashy but still looks nice, definitely better than the factory hub caps. They are not very glossy but also not dull. The silver color is bright which I think looks good. Excellent price too. I would recommend to anybody looking for a replacement set of hub caps."
4,Nice Surprise,"The first two stories in this book were wonderful - beautifully crafted, warm and empathetic. The others were a little disappointing, but I'd say the first two stories are worth the price of the book."
2,Stick with their stands and drums,"Not the best PDP product. (I have a kit and extra boom stands that are fine+.) These cymbals are awful, though. You know it's bad when mom begs you to replace the hats!!! Said they sounded like garbage can lids. Ha! (Got some new hats, BTW.) Actually, though, if you hang the hat like a crash and use the 16"" as a crash--they sound ""more bronze"" than Meinl HCS and other brasses. That's why I give it 2 stars and not one. There really are no hats out there that sound worse than these! If you buy them, be sure to play them for mom (a lot) to get some good stuff... ;D"
3,Is this true?,"As most of the reviews state, this is a thinly disguised history of events from 1945 - 1985+ written by someone who wants to reverse the changes of Vatican II, including returning to a latin mass. He has an intense dislike for Pope Paul VI and virtually labels him a heretic. Having said that it presents an interesting slant on history and if true, wow! Are there freemasons in the curia? Did the Russians kill John Paul I? Did Freemasons or some other powerful American-West European power group try to kill John Paul II in 1981 and blame it on the Russians? So, the author would have us believe."
4,Vatican,"This is one of those books that you either get very bored with or which you are totally captivated by. Being a book of over approximately a thousand pages, there may be those that say Malachai Martin has gone into too much detail in many areas, however I feel that with that detail comes a very full reading experience. Mr Martin has written a book that - like no other - captures the intricacies of Vatican politics at the highest levels in a way that is fully interesting. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a full, interesting and informative read. Is a shame that this book is out of print!DV"
4,A Tedious Read...but Rewarding,"Malachi Martin has once again demonstrated his ability to situate facts in plausible, indeed prophetic, fictional narratives. A good read for those who are passionate about the decline of the Roman Church."
4,china mountain zhang,this book was written by a former high school friend - she is as amazing as an adult writer as she was as a teenager
5,A different view of the future,"Wow, this one really has a different view of the future; it really made me think. In McHugh's future, a communist revolution has taken place in America, and China is the dominant superpower! The interesting part is McHugh's details about living in this very different future. The characters are interesting and very believable. The book reads like a series of short stories, not a novel, although eventually all the sections about the title character do tie together into something like a plot. In general, this isn't the one to read if what you look for is cool tech, but nevertheless the section about a holistic engineering is pretty neat, and rings very true-- if McHugh isn't actually an engineer, she does seem to have a feel for what it's about."
2,"Good world, weak plot","McHugh has a gift for character and world-building, but the rotating points-of-view contributed to burying an already weak plot. While a writer like LeGuin can marry sociological observation with a thrilling story, McHugh succeeds in only the first of these, and I only made it halfway before setting this one aside."
5,"Plotless? Yes, but so is life...","Commentator Dick Oliver faults the book for having no strong plot elements - but that's exactly why this book is so revolutionary.You can take or leave all of the characters, situations, actions and locations because they don't really matter to ""China Mountain Zhang."" What's really happening here is one of those exceedingly rare stories that reads like real life - the main characters move and grow throughout the book, never knowing exactly what's going to happen next. By the end of the book the characters are older, more mature, more confident, and you have come to care about China Mountain very deeply. No dragons have been slain, no worlds saved - just life and living the best one can. Does this mean his story is over? Not at all. You know life will go on.This is a book that screams for a sequel."
3,Interesting but flawed,"In the future-as-awful-but-technologically-advanced tradition of William Gibson, Maureen McHugh offers us a glimpse of life following a takeover of the earth -- and Mars too -- by the communist Chinese. New York City is a pit (this is science fiction?), yet people commute from as far away as Virginia. The best place a person can live is in China; the worst, the south pole on Mars. Plastic surgery is very common. Doctors can do miracles with custom-made viruses. People have jacks built into their wrists for accessing, and being accessed by, big-brotherish computers. The techie parts and the visons of life on Earth and Mars under Chinese rule are interesting and rewarding; without suffering through the extreme negativity and hyperobjectivity of Gibson, the reader gets that juicy taste of what the future might feel like. What's weak is the guts/emotions/human aspect. In particular, the ending fails. Good for science fiction addicts, not so good for general readers."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"China Mountain Zhang explores the future when the Chinese way has taken over, and not just on earth, but other parts of the solar system, as well.It follows one character in particular as he moves from place to place, working and living, and dealing with the fact it is a no-no to not be hetero in this society."
1,"Over-hyped, plotless and ultimately pointless","Harlan Ellison raved about this book on the Sci-Fi channel when it came out, calling it the best book he'd read that decade. Harlan is well known for his enthusiasms, but something is missing here. I don't know if he and I read the same book because he's much smarter than I am and I didn't like the book at all. What's extraordinary is that the book has no plot and it has two graphic male... ""love"" scenes that serve no point other than they fill space. They certainly don't advance or enhance the story, what little there is of it, and it tells us nothing about the character of China Mountain Zhang other than he likes boys and not girls. I don't know anyone who personally liked the book, but Tor apparently did. They published it, after all. But I've no more interest in the author because of this book. She can have my money, but she can't have any more of my time."
1,Olympus Camedia C-3020,"The camera appeared to work great. We were in love with the pictures and ease of use. Within 6 weeks it just quit working. Warranty support through Amazon.com is impossible to locate. So, am I stuck with a waste of money?"
1,Nice while it lasted,"Loved my camera while it lasted...but now, just one month after the warranty expired, the camera is completely dead. I have been unsuccessful thus far in getting Olympus to honor the warranty and fix the product. I'll think twice before buying an Olympus product again."
4,Nice Camera,"My father has a Nikon Coolpix 5000 (5 megapixels), my mom an Olympus C-4040 (4 megapixels). Both of those take awesome, awesome pictures but are very pricey. After reading reviews and searching the internet I settled for this one. According to Megapixel.net it had the best image quality.It certainly is rather easy to use and figure out. The manuals for the camera and software,however, are painfully inadequate. I ended up going to Olympus's website to get better detailed instructions after having problems installing the software into my computer.The different modes all take really nice photos. The sound of the lense as you power on and off is really grating, really sounds like it's sick or something. Batteries don't last too long when you use the LCD.But overall very nice camera that takes beautiful pics."
1,camedia is an ... clunker.,"After reading glorious reviews, I ran out and paid top dollar for a Camedia. After using the camera for six months, all the pictures produced a red splotch in the upper left corner. Fixed under warranty but repair person said this was a common problem. Could happen again. After repairs pictures now washed out. Lens cap is easy to loose and you must remember to take it off before turning on the camera or lens motor will grind. Camera has many bells and whistles. Unfortunately, they are not intuitive to use so one is constantly reading the manual to operate this camera. I take most of my pictures outdoors and this camera is just not as rugged as some cheaper models. Not recommended for rugged outdoor use. Many features may appeal to expert indoor photographer."
4,Wonderful Book!,"I use this book every day in a multi level classroom. The book is available on a shelf and the students can choose a response and then walk themselves through to the finished project, following the clearly written instructions. It has increased my student's interest in reading, and has helped pre-literate students respond to literature. The grades that have used it are from K - 5. I hope that Ms. Witmer will do a follow up book that will be as interesting to upper elementary students."
4,Check this book out!,"I was glad to see a book like this. All you have to do is copy and off you go!! I haven't started using the activities, but I plan to use them with our AR program at school. I think these activities will help the students really take the time to read the book and respond to it, rather than just read for the test. If you are looking for a good reading activities book, this is your book!!"
2,Cheaply made edition dealing with Meissen portrait figurines,"Anyone wishing to delve more into Meissen should avoid this title. Everything about this edition -- text, photographs, binding, screams cheap. No substance. Not recommended."
1,"Good movie, horrible service",The movie was very entertaining.... when it was not freezing on the screen during amazon instant streaming. Not to mention the 5 minute screen black-out in the middle of the show.
5,Coming of Age,"Pucker Factor 10 was a very enjoyable journey as the author turns ""of age"". It flows extremely well, and has a good balance of humor and sobriety, peppered with perspective. It, of course, will resonate with the Vietnam era helicopter pilots but with those who served in any capacity in the Vietnam War---as well as those who didn't. It is entertaining, in a ""Mash"" sort of way."
4,Helicopter work,"I liked this book because it typlified a lot of our service for a year. Some was exciting, some scary, some was just work and hard work it was. Not too glamorous, just serving. Never too relaxed to forget the pucker factor."
4,One of the better books.,I have read numerous war memoirs. Pucker Factor 10 is not one of the glorified kilometers that you will find. Quite a bit of the book is spent discussing his pre and post Vietnam days. It gives you a decent insight on the mindset of the day. I would recommend this book to just about anyone.
2,You gotta be joking!!!,"It was a fair read until the author's story of he and his friends showing up at the airport, with beer, renting an aircraft and drinking said beer in flight.The author's comment about drinking and driving being illegal, but drinking and flying NOT being illegal, is totally INCORRECT. On top of that, I know of NO self respecting aircraft operator who would rent an aircraft, a second time, to someone who, dropped empty beer cans on the ramp at the conclusion of his first rental flight!! This totally negated ANY credibility as to the veracity of the author. By the way, the Cessna 172 does not have a ""choke"". At least the author admitts he has no business flying an airplane."
5,Long Life Battery,"This battery lasted over 25 years before I had to replace it. The standard line of ever-ready and duracell are crap. Not this one, built not to leak. Use in Simpson VOM meter."
2,Cheap price - cheap build,"At about half of Dremel's price for their rechargeable unit, you would think this was a good deal. However, you will need to buy AA batteries (not included). If you don't use it a lot, then that's not much of a problem.Build wise, it feels cheaper, and will probably break if dropped. I am using it with a long diamond ream, and it oscillates pretty bad at the tip, which makes it a little difficult to use. I have to put the ream inside the small hole(1/8""), that I am trying to clean, before turning it on, because the tip of the ream oscillates about 1/4"" of an inch.If you want to just clean golf balls, which is what they sell this as, then it should be fine. If you also want to use it for any other kind of detail work, go with their better units."
3,Golfers Dremel Tool,"Loved the great price, but was disappointed that the plastic casing on the tool itself looked as if it had been used as a football and was all scratched up and had dents in it. At least the case itself was still intact, so there was no doubt it was a new item. It was a gift, so that was an embarrassing situation."
5,Book for the beginner,What a great book to get started on a new hobby. Simple but with details at the same time.
5,Excellent,"Very good reference for the newbie beekeeper. There are so many opinions and so many contradictions among beekeepers and it is such a regional variance that all the reference you can find is always helpful. No 2 beekeepers are alike and figuring out what you should do where you live can be a challenge, but this is a good book."
4,Good starter information for the novice beekeeper,This book contains most everything that you'll need to know to get your first hive up and running.The format is nice and easy to use for a beginner.
3,you need to have good vision to read this,"This book has a lot of good information in it, the Photos are great, but the small and light print on the glossy pages make it very hard to read unless you just happen to have a magnifying glass."
5,My husband loves the book!,Delivery was fast and my husband had to wait for the book till his birthday but it was well worth it. Thanks!
3,It's Okay,But I wanted to read about Top Bar Hives and this book didn't really go into any detail about them.
3,Great Pictures vs. Poor Organization,"This book has fantastic pictures of everything from lighting a smoker to waggle dances to frames of capped brood. I've read many beekeeping books, and none compare. The text, however, leaves much to be desired. As mentioned by others, the type is very small and is often printed over other items and hard to read. The subjects don't seem to be logically organized, and the index is insufficient. When I noticed many bees fanning on the front entrance of my new hive, I couldn't find any mention of ""heat"" or ""temperature"" in either the table of contents or the index. I stumbled across a mention of fanning being common behavior in queenless colonies, and panicked until the afternoon shadows cooled the hive and the fanning stopped! Enjoy and learn from the pictures, but don't count on this as a comprehensive reference."
4,Good book for beginners,"I bought this book last month. I had hoped that it would be a complete guide for bee-keeping. It is not a complete guide but it is a complete introduction.So, now I am looking for a bee-keeping guide with more detail. And I think that anyone who seriously wishes to pursue keeping bees will want additional resources beyond this book. As its title suggests, this work is just the ""bare bones"" of beekeeping and lacks the detail or depth that a beekeeper will need. Still, overall, I found this a good introduction and would recommend it to others starting up a backyard apiary hobby!The Backyard Beekeeper: An Absolute Beginner's Guide ... gives the beginner an overall feel for what he can expect from bee-keeping, both the hard work and the fun."
5,Great book and great information,This book is full of all the info a person wanted to know to start seriously thinking about beekeeping. From a beginners standpoint this is an excellent book. This book is packed full of information and an excellent reference.If you're rally interest in becoming a beekeeper you must read this title:The Complete Book Of Beekeeping
4,Join a beekeepers club,"This is good book, but hands on instruction with a expierianced beekeeper is something that you can't get from a book. Find a local club (do a google search) and go to the meetings. The people there can tell you things you need to know about the local environment, Like how much honey the bees will need for the your winters. Ask to come along when one of them go after a swarm."
4,Excellent book for Beginner Hobbyist Beekeepers,"When we became interested in keeping bees we checked out every book at the local library and spent hours on the internet for information. It is hard to find a modern, in print book that is affordable and aimed at the hobbyist beekeeper. We found a copy of this in our local library and within a few pages we knew we had to have it. Although its written in the USA we found it to be one of the most relevant to our situation here in New Zealand as he refers to the seasons as opposed to months of the year which can be confusing when you are changing between hemispheres.Well written with loads of colour photos and things to and make with honey and beeswax at the end.I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who is looking at getting bees or has already got one or more hives in their back yard."
2,Give it up..,"their first cd was very funny .. unfortunately, their second attempt was a stretch, to say the least...it sounds like they ran out of material."
2,I've heard better,A friend of mine had this album and I listen to it and it was fair. Jerky Boys are funnier.
5,DHA100,Great stuff. All NEW CHAPTER products are great;it has been over a year now that i have been taking DHA100 and i'm feeling great.
3,powerful but deeply flawed by its own ideological agenda,"This is a powerful book; the writing is quite extraordinary at times; the arguments impassioned. and sometimes too much so. I agree with the reviewer above who is disturbed by Ophir's absolutely one side treatment of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict with Israel totally and always in the wrong and even coming close to his idea of absolute evil. As an Israeli himself, Ophir has adopted a left-wing stance that leaves no room for anything but outright condemnation. a pity because Ophir is brilliant and provocative and his long analysis of the Holocaust, esp in the last chapter, is nothing short of dazzling."
4,Good Buy,I had trouble in using S-Video to RCA converter(box model). So i chose this one and it worked really well for me. So i highly recommend this product if you are using Inspiron 600m series laptop.
4,Self education,Wonderful book on self-education through reading -- particularly interesting for its ambitious forays into science and mathematics.
5,rec'd on time and packaged well,"bought these for my very large hubby. He loves them, he calls them his every day suspender. He likes them because the clamps are heavy duty. they also wash up very well"
4,Huge!,"I bought these for a nerd-themed 4th of July party, but they are more serious old man suspenders than decorative suspenders. the elastic is like 3inches wide. Not exactly what I was looking for, but very formidable if you're looking for hefty suspenders."
5,Suspenders,"This is not a heavy duty suspender like the description says. They're a good light weight suspender that stretches good which makes them comfortable. I like these for small, light wight jobs that don't need a heavy tool belt or just for your pants if you don't wear a belt."
5,Great suspenders for the price,"I'm very pleased with this product. Lots of quality here for relatively small amount of money, equals great value. I've been wearing them every day since they arrived. They're very comfortable to wear, even shirtless. The straps are wide, thick (and soft to the skin when shirtless). The clasps are thick and strong and would probably hold up a lightly loaded tool belt without a problem. Dunno, I bought heavy duty, padded suspenders for that task from Amazon,Custom Leathercraft 5121 Padded Work SuspendersThey work great, so I have no need to try the USA scheme suspenders on a tool belt.I like these so much, that I've ordered their tape rule suspenders.Custom LeatherCraft 110RUL Heavy Duty Tape Rule Elastic Suspendersand I wish that they had more choices of nice colors and color schemes in this style of their suspenders."
3,ok functionally - terrible packaging,"I couldn't believe the amount of heavy duty stapling and the little plastic thingies stuck through the material in at least two places. It was like trying to break in to Fort Knox. In the process of trying to remove some of the heavy duty long staples, one cannot help unraveling some of the suspender material. Why on earth they package it like this is beyond my imagination. But past all that, they seem fine as functioing suspenders - at least they keep my jeans up!"
5,"Simply, a marvelous ""little book.""","I absolutely loved this book. Working in one of the most competitive industries out there, I am always searching for the best written on the subject of selling. I found Brian Tracy's maxims and thoughts on selling to be incredibly refreshing. The real beauty of the book is its simplicity, written in true ""little book"" form. We write a different quote from it on our office board every morning to ""fire us up!"" Definitely a book to read every time you need a little inspiration. I know I do!"
5,Nice Router,"I really like my new router. It will do everything I need it to do. The adjustment and tightening lever are the way to go. It comes with a 2 1/2 inch base you should know the 1 3/16ths base is what is needed to use any guides. Nice adjustments and easy use, plenty of power."
4,Where's the variable speed?,I really wanted to buy this router but went with the Bosch 1618evs. You need to slow the router down on hardwoods to prevent burning. I own several Milwaukee tools and find them to be of excellent quality and design. Why did they miss the variable speed?
2,Far Behing la diva Tina Arena,I give Belinda credit for the attempt but this attempt pales when compared to Tina Arena's venture into French-language recordings. Belinda's American accent lacks any charm or exotic appeal. And her selection of French songs is pushing the envelope for francophone audiences. Even many of France's top singers dare not revisit the songs of Piaf and Ferre as their versions are revered. This recording is not for anyone who understands the French language and its musical traditions!
2,"Tu me pèles le jonc, Belinda!","Bearable as the muse for the grooviest all-girl band to ever come out of LA, she's given us one dishrag album after another in years that she's become a menacing solo `artiste'. But one doesn't need to comprehend the idiom to instantly recognize the tinny vocal styling (pure Piaf thievery), her clunky French diction (moving to Paris hasn't helped the argot) or dizzyingly ditzy arrangements (e.g. ""La Vie En Rose"" as Euro-gay camp disco? Mon dieu!!). I surmise this could all be a lot worse (it could be ""Heaven On Earth"" or ""A Woman And A Man"" or ""Live Your Life Be Free"" or, worst of all, heaven-help-us, ""Runaway Horses"") but rather than Chteau Lafite, we are left with escargot on the breath. My grade: C"
2,mediocre in any language,"this is a perfect example of how people with ""clout"" get to indulge themselves in little fantasies. belinda carlisle was/is a mediocre singer in english and she's a mediocre singer in french, too. if this is somehow supposed to be an homage to edith piaf, it's way short of the goal. singing in another language and spicing up your band with the likes of brian eno and sharon shannon doesn't guarantee anything. a big snore"
2,"Oh boy, that pronounciation.....","If you are used to listening to French songs sung by the French, and you know French, this disc will .... startle you. Still, I was looking forward to hearing ""Merci Cherie"", which was originally sung by an Austrian (Udo Juergens), winning the annual ""Eurovision"" chanson contest in the late 1960s. What a disappointment Belinda's rendition is- I wish she'd stuck to English songs! I love her solo work from the 1980's. The only thing I like about this album is the cover art. She continues to look marvelous! Try Mireille Mathieu, Francoise Hardy, or France Gall."
1,Merde!,"I was looking forward to this CD and it's just awful! Her American accent was grating, the arrangements other than the first track were dreadful.Isabelle Boulay's ""Avec le temps"" is a haunting, lush rendition, Belinda's was NOT. Jacques Brel and Edith Piaf must be rotating in their graves with their songs being butchered too. ""La Vie en Rose"" in disco tempo?? Mon Dieu!Belinda needs to be Walking Like An Egyptian - right out of this realm!"
5,Back with a surprise,"Great, great album. And great selection of songs, too. The version of ""Jezebel"" is one I'm not particularly fond of, but the overall is very good. Nice to hear Belinda back."
5,"""Fan-tastic!""","This is a wonderful CD. I'm a huge Belinda Carlisle fan, and if you are like me, you must listen to her sing French before you die. Difficult to choose a favorite cut on here, but I'd have to go with ""Jezebel"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" a song that used to get on my nerves when Luna sang it, but with Belinda's vibrato, it becomes near ethereal. I went with the Bonus CD edition, but I have yet to take the French version out of my CD player."

4,Heart sutra explained,"Any Zen student could benfit from reading Bernie's analysis of the heart sutra, which is the subject of the first half of this book. Bernie throughly analyzes the sutra somtimes going as far as to analyze every syllable of a word. This may seem like it could be very dull. 70 or so pages of analysis on a 24 line sutra might seem a bit excessive, but Bernie some how keeps it interesting.Considering the importance of the heart sutra in Zen practice it seems to me this book should probably be considered for required reading for all beginning Zen students. All of that withstanding there is still the second half of the book in which bernie offers more of the same insights on the identity of relative and absolute and the bodhisattva precepts. This is good stuff and a pretty easy read so I'd highly recommend it."
1,Would help if we knew what songs are in the set!!,How about putting a list up of the songs that are in the cd set. I really like to kind of have that information first before I purchase it.
5,365 Days of Power,"Rick Renner has really out did himself on this one, I start every day with this book! Thank you Mr. Renner"
5,365 Days of Power (Kindle/PC Format),I enjoyed this daily book of prayer and devotion which I purchased in 2008. I recently purchased the kindle/PC edition. The kindle/PC edition didn't list each devotional prayer and confession with the month and date of each prayer. I recommend you purchase the book instead of the kindle edition. This book will truly open your heart and mind.
4,scholarly Believer,"This is a great book, but you're got to remember that its an excerpt of a far greater book called Sparkling Gems from the Greek. Go ahead and get this one -- but DON""T STOP UNTIL YOU'VE PLACED YOUR E ORDER FOR SPARKING GEMS.... a book that will just blow you away -- a fact evidenced by nearly 300,000 people who have already brought that hard copy book.The book above is a good start, but it's a far cry from the real Sparkling Gems from the Greek. Start with this one above -- but keep your eyes out for the day that the e-version of Sparkling Gems is announced. Sparkling Gems is a book you JUST MUST HAVE in your e-library. Hope this helps.... Scholarly Believer"
4,Good basic planer,I had this for a while...it works fine. It should have included the dust chute though.The surface finish is ok...but you will need to plane/scrape/sand any wood run through it. I get some snipe but nothing unexpected.
4,"Good planer, but get the 13"" 2-speed","I have used this product extensively for about a year. I have run some pretty heavy stuff through it--8/4 maple and a fair bit of 8/4 and 6/4 teak. I am on my second set of blades and have not had any serious problems. The stand is a nice add, but it is difficult to put on wheels without spending a fortune on pre-made caster set up. I ended up building a solid wood box with casters from home depot that is much sturdier. All in all, I think for the extra 100 bucks, I would go with the 13"", 2 speed. It makes the 12"" width stock work much better and it looks like a slightly heavier product, which is usefull when running 8/4 or any long stock."
2,not very impressed,I just fired up this planner for the first time. everything worked fine for the first 10 1 X 6 cedar boards. then the feed roller stopped. turns out the drive sprocket for the roller is in about 8 small pieces; after only 10 boards! not real impressive to say the least. will see what delta has to say tomorrow.
5,A Great read!,We selected this book for our monthly book club comprised of 10 women and we all loved it! Made for some interesting discussion regarding families and mariage.
3,Enjoyed it in spite of itself.,"I found this book to be a ""comfort"" read. Not that bad things didn't happen, some did, but it was such an easy read that I was always eager to pick it up again. I could pick it apart but giving it 3 stars while really enjoying the story, in a way tells you that there were things about it that were annoying but I overlooked the annoyances. I liked it."
3,Not the best book I've ever read...,"but not the worst either. Some parts were so interesting I couldn't put the book down, some parts were so dull I couldn't wait to be done with the entire thing! In general I'd say the book was alright, although I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, there are too many other great books out there to read!"
2,good for a light beach read,"This book will keep you reading pretty much all the way through. I read it in two sittings, and I would have read it one if life hadn't called.The characters are interesting, at the very least, but I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. Some of the characters that have the most drama/trauma in their lives are the ones least psychologically exposed to the reader, so it's really difficult to give a darn. Kind of strange given how long this book was.I think that this book was also cleverly written around book club suggestions, but would have been much more intelligent and fun had it really linked the novels to the characters' lives in a more meaningful way.Still a fun read. I wouldn't pay the B&N; $15 price tag, though."
3,Not as good as I thought,not holding my attention.I find myself wanting it to be further along than I am. I will not finish it
3,Solid chick-lit,"This book is solid British chick-lit for the crowd who is a little older than the Jane Green fans may be. It was interesting enough to keep me entertained on a boring business trip and plane ride, but overall not a big intellectual thrill. The list of books that the club read, the little descriptions, and their discussions of the books gave me a few good ideas of books to read (some classic). I would have liked the book discussions to be a little longer, and segue into their personal dramas a little more cleverly."
3,The Reading Group,"It was a fun read but lots of fluff! If you like the TV Series ""Desperate Housewives"" you will love this book! The author creates a relationship with the reader and the characters, though some are difficult to like. I am not sure I would have finished it if I were not reading it for a book club."
2,what a soapy boor,"I am an avid reader and it takes a lot for me to pan a book, but pan this one I will. It was like reading a bad soap opera. I didn't care about the characters-they were fake and dopey-and certainly didn't care what happened to them. The best part of the book was the last page-it was over!!! I only gave it two stars because someone actually took the time to write this stuff-albeit badly."
1,Too many characters-weak women,"This book was a chore to get through, there are 25 characters in the beginning to keep track of, had to keep flipping back to the first page to keep track of who is who. Characters are also not developed enough to care about them, they come across as whiney and spineless. Am taking this book to Goodwill, not a keeper."
3,Well worth the visit,"I visited this trading post during a motorcycle trip in June, 2005. After reading Elizabeth Hedgemann's ""Navajo Trading Days"", I did some more research and purchased this book. Good photographs and historical data on the surrounding area. I plan to return to the Navajo Nation in 2006 and revisit this trading post and others."
3,Probably something else out there that is better,"I received this program as a gift when I first began learning Flash. I tried it out for awhile, but found it difficult without knowing the flash environment very well. About a year later I tried it again, and got a solid beginning to Actionscript. I find it very helpful to have someone speaking and showing you what to do over simply reading direct from a book. There are several lessons and excercises from learning about variables to creating a space game to beginning XML.However, when I received it more than a year ago, it was dated. It is based on Flash 5 I believe, and the quicktime video isn't always sharp. Livingston is pleasant to listen to and reasonably easy to understand, but I don't feel after completing the program that I learned enough to make this actionscript applicable. I would look for a more current training course, this one will teach you some of the basics, but will not give you much more experience than many online tutorials."
3,Snooozzzzze!,"Admittedly coding is not fun. But come on. Not only was the CD-ROM boring but the quality was not good. I respect the power of actionscript and it was a nice idea to record a tutorial on CD but at least use real life workflow situations rather than some corny poorly drawn cartoon's. Unless there are better CD-ROM's out there on actionscripting, I would inform anyone to stick to reading the books or go oline and read free tutorials on actionscripts. And no, I am not a hater of Dan Livingston's work or do I work for a competing instructor."
2,You call this a Biography?,"This isn't a biography at all in the truest sense of the word. What it is is an in-depth analysis of his discography and studio habits. We get very little of his personal life in these 500 plus pages. He barely mentions some of his girlfriends or his only daughter for that matter. He seems to have written this book with an obvious bias against Van Morrison for whatever personal reason. He never misses an opportunity to reiterate ad nauseum to let us know he is difficult and moody. We get the picture already, move on. I'm sure people in the music industry might be able to comprehend all of the technical studio jargon and keep track of the endless stream of musicians and managers but not the typical fan. He did not address the fact or rumor about ""Brown-eyed girl"" originally being titled ""Brown-skinned girl"" and unexplicably he doesn't even mention Bert Berns in the Dramatis Personae. I give him two stars mainly for the interviews and quotes."
2,Does not reveal the man,"I'm a long time fan and was well aware that Van Morrison is not a very likeable individual. However, this bio seemed a compilation of public information about Van Morrison with nothing really revealing about the man who has written such great music. There's no way to reconcile the despicable person presented in this bio with a guy who writes the kind of great, humanistic songs that fill the Van Morrison portfolio. Unfortunately, Van isn't talking and given his apparent desire to paint a distorted picture of his past (one of the few good revelations in the book), we'll probably never know the real person."
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother reading this book. It offers no insight into Van Morrison the man, and very little into his music. The author's negative bias is obvious on every page. In every instance, he seems determined to put VM in the worst possible light. He cobbles together quotes from some musicians Morrison has worked with, and since Morrison did not authorize this biography, some obviously very important people's voices are not heard, yet he seems to give the impression that these people offer the last word on Morrison. He couldn't even come up with some interesting photos for the book. Equally annoying is the pompous tone Heylin adopts when discussing the music. In all, the book seems to offer only a timeline of when various albums were recorded,along with some boring business details. If you want to know about Van Morrison, listen to the music, and relegate this book to the remainder bin."
2,"Good vibrating cushion -- not ""massaging""","This product is a good vibrating cushion, but it does not do any ""massaging.""My chief complaints are:-Does not massage-Straps used for securing to the chair are too short for a normal office chair, I had to use rubber bands to extend it.-The leg vibrator was uncomfortable. It's in an awkward place and kind of dug into my legs more than helped.-The cushions on the back made my chair feel much smaller.Overall, if you have a good chair (that doesn't already feel too small) and some extra rubber bands, this isn't too bad. But it is just a vibrating cushion."
2,Factual but dry-valuable for history buffs,"This book is not a techno-thriller, but it documents in excruciating detail the process whereby the Russian govt. agreed to establish the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) in Moscow. Note: continued US funding for the ISTC remains in doubt, given the budget hawks in the US Congress"
2,Disproportionate water to sky photos,"Unfortunately, the number of water vs. sky photos is quite disproportionate in this book. Only the last chapter (out of five) pertains to skies. Yes, there are many very nice water scenes that, of course, have a sky in the picture. I was, however, hoping to see more photos that emphasized the sky as the subject. If you want water photos this book provides many lovely ones. However, if you need skies and thought this book would provide a fair amount, you would be disappointed."
2,Outdated,"I was very disapointed with this book. I felt that it was way too expensive and very outdated. The book takes about an hour to read, as 2/3 of the book is old black and white photos. There may be more value, if you are planning to ride specific routes as detailed in the book, provided that there have been no changes in them over the past decade (unlikely)."
5,A very practical and helpful resource.,"I this this is a very helpful book. Highway conditions and distances and where to buy gasoline andwhat to expect as far as camping or ""motels"" along the way is great. Photos are black and white, but the beautiful color scenery on the DVD Alaska by Motorcycle makes up for that. I found the DVD inspiring and the book very practical. Since I sell the book at [...] my opinon could be slanted toward the book and DVD because of that, but I don't believe so. I know reading it makes me wish I could take time to motorcycle to Alaska myself, but maybe when my husband and I retire. The only thing that makes me think twice are the mosquitoes. I hate mosquitoes."
2,DVD not worth the effort,"While the book may be considered a decent read, the DVD is sure a waste of time. It consists of a series of slides while Greg talks over them. Some of the pictures are nice, but as far as a useful preparation DVD for your trip, forget it.I thought it would consist of some reviews of equipment, views of how to prepare for the trip, highlights to look for, recommendations for places to go and how to get there, and at least a little useful info. Instead, it is a slide show with a narration over the top. Save your money and just buy the book. If you MUST have it, buy it used so you won't feel so bad when you view it....."
2,Not the most helpful book,This book was not as helpful as I had hoped with our trip planning. Seems like he dwells on the negative things that can happen while traveling. I expected more encouragement. Lots of black and white pictures. I guess it would depend on how much you are using other resources for information.
3,"Decent Quick Read, nothing too insightfull",This is a quick read on a possible way you could motorcycle through Alaska. There is not a lot I couldn't think of before going. The maps are primitive and only cover certain areas.The author is knowledgeable and includes lots of pictures. I just felt uninspired and not much smarted after reading.
2,Lee jeans-bootcut flare,"Picture on the web page makes these jeans look white. But they are tan instead. The jeans, themselves, are nice. But thought I was purchasing white. Plus the description of the jeans does not specify exactly what color they are. This is an ""Amazon"" error."
3,Competent if unexciting.,"As much a history of the Antiquities Act of 1906 as the national monuments themselves, Preserving Different Pasts is overly concerned with turf battles, especially those of Frank Pinkley (1881-1940), superintendent of the southwestern national monuments. The book does not attempt even an overview of the individual monuments, which are a grab bag of smaller NPS sites both natural and historical. The research is thorough and the writing is workmanlike if unexciting."
5,This is AWESOME!,"Really easy to put together and take down. It is sturdy and looks hard to break. It's big enough for my '04 girl, but not too big to be a pain. Good price for the quality!"
5,just right,"my boys havn't used it much in the snow, but it seems to be sturdy and well built goal for the money."
5,nice product,Very easy to put together and take apart Will be great for backyard soccer gamesIm glad we purchased it
4,Great product for the price and very portable.,"This SKLZ Kickster goal is very good for the price. The thing i like about it the most is the portability. You can just bring it anywhere and setup it all up. Some people complain its not as sturdy. You can't really expect a portable one to be really sturdy. If you want sturdy you need the heavy kinds which defeats the purpose of this being portable. However, when i tried it out it seems to be withstanding really hard ball strikes. I definitely recommend this product."
5,AWESOME!!!,Great product. I have a U8 Boys & U10 Girls and this works awesome. It's super easy to assemble and take down. I would recommend this product...
3,Fun but fragile,You will enjoy these goals. They are fairly easy to put up but a pain to take apart. The parts are fragile so they may break. I had parts breaking within a month. We use them about twice a week and have had them for three months now. They have about 3 more months left in them. Need better metal or materials because they are weak.
2,Goal Breaks Easily,"I ordered two of these goals in February for pick up soccer once a week. After a couple months, one of the goals is completely destroyed. The top corner of the goal (that connects net to base) is made out of cheap plastic and broke as soon as a soccer ball hit it. This, in effect, means that one entire side is now broken. This doesn't seem like much of an issue (seems logical that you could get replacement parts for cheap plastic pieces) until you go to the product's website and look under the replacement parts section, and discover that there are no replacement parts for this sort of thing."
4,"Easy to set up, durable and fun; hard to re-pack","My two sons are in AYSO soccer and a travelling team, so we get a lot of soccer action around our house. We found this practice goal to be very convenient - packed down, it's small and light, easy to carry even for an 8-year old. We found it simple to set up with only a cursory glance at the instructions, and once set up it was reasonably stable and strong given its size and shape. I.e., if a player bodily crashes into it it's going to react poorly, but it shrugs off hard shots on goal with ease.The only problem worth remarking has been that it's devilishly difficult to fold back up as originally shipped from the factory. That makes it kind of hard to get it all back into the carry sack, especially if you're playing in cool weather because the metal parts drain heat from your fingers like nobody's business. Apart from that issue, an excellent product for the price."
2,Absolutely delicate goals two broke in matter of weeks,"We Initially got a set of these goals one of them broke on the very first day when a hard kick crashed into the side bars that connect the base and the goal, its made of cheap plastic ; Amazon was kind enough to accept the return and ship a replacement. The replacement lasted over a 3-4 weeks but yet again the same thing again happened this time one of our heavily built players fell over it.Now we are stuck with one goal . I would NOT recommend these goals at all , at the most these are for good for under 10 or even younger kinds , but not for kids over 10 and over.ThanksAp.s I resisted writing a reviews thus far , but I am finding it difficult to sell the 1 goal I have on Craigslist even at a cheap price, cos people know that even though these goals are easy to set up, its by no means value for money , I am disappointed to say the least."
1,Shoddy,"Cheaply made, I should have known better. The hinged lid gaps with the main body. Of course it is just a game of cards."
3,Good product but a little bit uncomfortable,The seat massager is a good product but it makes the chair very uncomfortable if you just want to sit and work. I do not recommend it if you want to use it at work.
3,"Not really permanent, purple at first","My hair is very dark brown and gray. It covered both at first, in a dark, purple color, which I liked. However, it quickly washed out and faded my hair to a brassy, reddish shade."
4,Slightly red but beautiful,This product worked very well for me. It's a bit redder than it is in the picture but it's a purplish-red and my hair was a dark blond when I dyed it. It gradually gets darker as it gets to the tips and it looks really cool. I love the way it looks and I love this product.
3,It's nice enough but it's shedding!,"Every time I pick it up from the glass shelf where I store it, a few more bristles have fallen out. It does a nice job but I can't say it's well made."
4,Hair looks great!,"I am already very fond of this brush. When used for normal brushing (as an experiment), it made my hair soft, smooth, and super shiney. When used with a hair dryer for a nice blowout, my hair comes out fantastic. I haven't had the bristle issue that I saw mentioned on here, yet. My only complaint about this brush is the fact there there isn't a nonslip grip. The handle is glossy, so it is easy to slide when turning in your hair. I didn't feel that the handle was too small either, which was a commom complaint that I saw on here. Over all - a great brush and almost perfect!"
3,"Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter","I was really excited to try this brush and find out if the natural hairs are worth the hype. It seemed to smooth my hair and grab it to help style. One negative was that the brush shed more than I did! I would find pieces of the brush hairs on my clothes, floor, and throughout the house. Also the printed label on the handle rubbed off onto my hand within the first two weeks and I transferred this to my other brush handle and other areas in the bathroom before I realized what had happened."
3,"Nice brush, but quality of manufacture questionable","The texture of the brush is nice on my hair, and the size and shape were as expected, but so far (3 weeks) several tufts have come out - the nylon bristle and the boars hair bristles with it. If this continues, it won't last long."
4,Brush,"The brush works well and arrived on time. I kind of wish I'd gotten a larger sized one, but it is a good product."
3,Fairly good,"Good brush, perfect diameter.I wish the bristles were slightly softer as it tends to pull the hair sometimes.I'd definitely recommend this product."
5,Round Brush,"I love this brush. The synthetic bristles are great for gripping my long, coarse hair, while the natural bristles smooth my hair.The one-piece construction means my hair doesn't get caught.I read a couple of reviews where folks didn't like the way the synthetic bristles hurt them. Well, just don't hit yourself with it. I hit myself the first few times I used it, but I quickly learned how to use the brush without hurting myself. :-)"
5,This brush is INCREDIBLE!!,"I love this brush! I have medium length hair and this brush is great with its' boar bristles, but also nylon bristles as it grabs the hair more. Now that I've used it, I can't imagine using any other brush out there. I would definitely recommend this brush."
4,Nice Brush,"I bought this brush because the boar bristles are supposed to distribute oils and grip hair better for blow drying. Sure enough, it works. I blow-dried my permed hair straight this morning in a matter of 50 minutes ( i have thick shoulder length hair that is semi-coarse). I was very pleased by the performance of this brush and I LOVE the nylon bristles. Some people may not enjoy their scratchy feel, but I am accustomed to brushing my hair with a metal bristle brush so I really liked it. The reason why I gave this brush four stars is because I question the quality of the brush...I had some little black bristles all over the floor after I was done blow-drying my hair and I know that another reviewer has had the same issue. I have never used another boar bristle brush before though, so I guess I can't really compare the quality to other brushes."
4,Useful tool,Perfect for styling medium length hair. Your hair can get stuck in it if you don't know how to use it properly. Always leaves my hair soft and frizz free.
1,HP Media Drive,I fell into the same category as some of the other writers. The HP Media drive failed and I have tried just about everything listed on the internet to get it restarted. It is gone. Seems to me like this device should last more than a couple of years. I decided I would not try another so I purchased a couple of WD external. Lots more capacity and thus far both are working fine.
2,Buyer Beware,"Like the other reviewer of this product, I too had a Personal Media Drive fail well before the 12-month warranty ran out. Calls to HP yielded no less than 12 transfers to different departments, none of whom were able to assist in getting this defective brick repaired/replaced. The unit worked flawlessly to backup important business data (along with music files), but when it failed, it failed miserably. I purchased this to go with the HP Media Center PC I purchased a few months before (w/ built-in drive bay to handle ""the brick"").Will positively NOT purchase another, and urge others to consider a more reliable product before handing over your $$$ to HP."
5,Sensitive and Provocative Flute and Harp and Oboe,"This combines three of my favorite solo instruments, flute, harp and oboe. In Mozart's Flute & Harp Concerto, he certainly explores the range and sound of these two, juxtaposing the two in great register leaps and ebb and flow with the orchestra.Salieri's Oboe and Flute Concerto one finds the marvelous Viennese operatic rendering of these two premier opera performers, with a most dramatic and sensual Largo.Milan, Kanga and Theodore are equally good, as well as the support of the English Chamber Orchestra and Chilingirian Quartet."
5,I LOVE this book,"This book is great and worth the investment. Not only is it a great resource, but it's also fun to read."
2,Round up the usual suspects,"Ah,yes. It's all the fault of those nasty patriarchal corporations (again). And the solution is so obvious! Live like a third-world peasant! I love it when first-world academics who enjoy all of the priveledges of high technology (medicine, air travel, food surpluses) advise others to live at the subsistence level. How terribly condescending to all of the REAL third-world peasants who desperately want to escape the subsistence-level life...the ones who vote with their feet by immigrating in hordes to first world, hi-tech capitalist countries. If the authors weren't so deadly serious, this book could be mistaken for a satire."
1,Much more violent than you would be led to expect,"Unless you are the type of nature lover who enjoys the Trials of Life videos, there is nothing at all to recommend this movie. There are some truly brutal scenes which both my husband and I found horrible to watch. I wouldn't let a child see this in a million years. It's so disturbing that I would worry about scarring them. In addition, all the scenes are extremely staged-looking with ridiculous sound effects and jokey voice-overs. I had really looked forward to seeing this (based on the title) and it was a disappointment in every way imaginable."
4,Garmin Bracket,"It works perfectly on my bicycle. It makes it easy to mount and remove the GPS, while placing it in a place that makes it easy to see while riding. I rated it 4 stars rather than 5 only because of what I consider to be a ridiculously high price. I will say though, that Amazon's price was the best I found."
4,A good 5th,"Segerstam has recorded these twice, once in Helsinki, and the earlier one in Denmark. Not that much difference. I think the Helsinki box set is still available new, so it should be a first choice. Then get these others individually.The 5th is well done. The tempos are slightly slower than the Helsinki disc. The 7th is OK, I can't really pick one 7th over the other. If you are a fan of the 7th, by all means get this disc.If you are interested in the Danish box set, they are fine, but you don't get much over the Helsinki set. I would settle for just a few discs of the Danish set, they are coupled with shorter works. Valse Triste here is just extra. No opinion on that.On the other hand, if you just want tone poems, they are on a disc separately, with the Danish orchestra."
3,worked but not for my carpet,"I wanted to run a flat cat5/6 cable under the carpet but I think it's the carpet that I have which this thing doesn't work well with. The end of this fishtape actually puncture the carpet padding and I couldn't get anything to work. In the end, I reel it back and it took a chunk of the carpet padding with it. I'm not going to diss it since it may be user error due to me being inexperienced with this type of thing."
2,Just a trickle of usefull info,I was new to this field and found this book to provide only the bearest of information. It is not worth the money. In fact the new identity game is full of money grubbers who give you a little advice and then recomend ten or fifteen other books that will help you through the process. This book mearly outlines the process with no real meat!! I give it two stars because there are a couple of items of minimum interest.
3,Tends to clog up a bit with sappy wood.,"This works well on hardwoods where you are taking 1/32nd or less of a 6"" board . . . much more than that, or on a sappier wood like Pine, it will plug up.It can be modified . . . but by the time you do it, you could just make your own out of a piece of HVAC register from the BORG. ;)"
3,Dust connector,"Taking the collector off and on is pretty easy, but the thumb screws make it a slow process. I have a dust collection system hooked up to it and have never had a problem with it clogging. My only real concern with it is that it hangs too low, when the stock is going through the planer it hits the fitting and causes some sniping problems. I have to tie it up with a rope in order for it not to interfere. Its actually the weight of the hose that casues the problem, but who dosn't have a 4"" flex hose hooked up to it? Unless someone out there makes a aftermarket one, its almost a neccessity. The chip debree would be overwhelming otherwise. You probably won't want it, but you have to get it."
4,"A ""must have"" accessory","After hooking the dust hood up to my planer and running one board through, I wondered why I didn't have this before. This is a ""must have"" accessory. It should come with the planer as standard equipment. I hooked it up to my shop vac and it worked fine, you just have to make a lot of dumps. The only reason I give it 4 rather than 5 stars is because the 4 inch outlet doesn't hook up well with other 4 inch connectors. I purchased a 4 inch to a 2 inch adaptor and had to butt the adaptor to the dust hood and duct tape it together. It works fine this way, but I wish they would just make it work the right way to begin with. Plus, if you like to have a nice looking shop it looks kinda bad to have a nice planer like this and then have duct tape holding the parts together. But again, functionally it's great."
5,A worthy investment,This dust collector port is a must have accessory for your delta 22-580 planer. The time you will save cleaning your workshop will pay for this port after just your first major project.
2,DESIGN FLAW,"I was disappointed to learn, upon mounting the Delta 50-446 Dust Connector that it sags down into the outfeed area. The method of connecting doesn't allow for any correction of this problem. Boards passing though the planer will always rub against the dust connector."
4,Dust Collector,"Easy install, good product. Wish there was a way to fold up the outfeed table without removing the dust collector."
1,I spy...........,"This Romper Room was B-O-R-I-N-G!!!! It will definitely put your kids to sleep by watching this. I watched for 5 minutes and shut it off. Yes, it was THAT bad!!!! It is nothing like the Romper Room that I remember. Please don't buy this! What happened to the magic mirror? Am I mistaken? Is the magic mirror another show?"
1,Terrible!,"I went to a seminar where Michael Depasquale taught. His technique was fair but his ego was way over the top.When I got back I received his book from my friend who bought it for me as a surprise for me and my kids.Well to see the least it wasn't a surprise because the information in the book was recycled, outed dated, garbage. I always respected the DePasquale name because on the father but after attending the seminar and reading the book I must confess my opinion has changed.Don't waste you time or your money!"
5,greatest show on earth,My husband and I really enjoy the older moveis. This just released and I bought it with the other items I purchased the same day.
5,An Endearing Classic,"I have seen this film many times, and still i come up with the quality of endearment given to all classics. With it's genre of the great Bible movie over voices and the emphasis on the fact that the cirus is life. It keeps audiances captivated throughout."
2,The Blandest Show on Earth,"I can't believe that this movie won the best picture Oscar for 1952. The DeMille touch is evident in many scenes but the dialogue is trite, the acting is flat and, in the case of Bette Hutton, the character is irritating."
4,Life on the Rock,"Ever wonder what it would be like to do time in Alcatraz? To live behind bars with some of the most notorious gangsters that ever lived? If so, then ""On the Rock"" is definitely your book.Alvin ""Creepy"" Karpis, a former Public Enemy Number One who spent 26 years at Alcatraz, tells us firsthand what it was like. The reader is given an insider's perspective on every prison fight, strike and attempted breakout that occurred at Alcatraz between 1936 and 1962. Karpis had strong opinions about his fellow inmates, like ""Machine Gun"" Kelly (""a bullsh*tter""), Robert ""The Birdman"" Stroud (""a b*stard"") and Al ""Scarface"" Capone (""completely insane""). It's a gritty story told with a fair share of gangster lingo and foul language. Karpis was quite a character, very intelligent and completely remorseless, and his personality comes through - raw and unfiltered - in ""On the Rock"". If you have even a passing interest in gangsters or prison life, you won't be disappointed."
3,Loved the dishes.....hated the packing job,"The plates are fantastic and I believe the price is very reasonable, BUT there were a number of broken plates and cups in the first sending....I called and complained and they resent them and packed them the same way and HALF of those were broken. They were very good about sending the replacements and in all I'm only a piece or two short of what I paid for, but it was frustrating."
5,Great for kids!!!!,This is a great BOOK!!!!-I bought it for my son and he loved it!!Shows kids exactly how to build some really neat things. We won't go wrong with buying this books!!
5,Great soccer training tool,"I first bought another brand of this type of training device for my 6 year old daughter to work on her kicking skills. After only a couple of hours, the other brand broke in half. The store replaced it with this version and it's worked well so far. Just a tip for those concerned about holding onto the cord: We bought a metal dog stake that you can twist into the ground from the local pet store and then you can put the velcro waist band around that. This allows you to work on kicking the ball on the ground without getting tangled and it leaves your hands free as well. This solution has worked very well for us."
3,Great while it lasted,I bought this for my 10 year old daughter to help with her soccer kicks. She loved it! She practiced with it all the time and really saw an improvement in her kicks. The negative is that it didn't last. A month later and the velcro won't hold the ball anymore and the strap disconnected from the belt around the waist. It's taped and tied together and my daughter still wants to use it. It's a great tool but I wish it lasted more than a month.
4,great bang for buck,"The SKLZ Star Kick Soccer Trainer is certainly an inexpensive way to improve soccer skills. My 10 year old daughter found it very helpful. However, if you are willing to spend a bit more, the Epic Soccer Training Program ([...]) really helped her get to the next level."
2,Very poorly constructed,This product in theory is a great idea. However the way it is made is so poor it came apart at the seams within minutes of use.
2,Cheap / Poor Quality,Not impressed with the SKLZ soccer trainer. It's made up of cheap elastic. Expected a better quality product from SKLZ.
2,breaks,"Damn thing has broken twice. Just not quality to me, plus its not really effective. The zero g soccer trainer my friend has seems way more effective for actual first touch."
3,Hmm its OK,"It seems to work pretty well, however my 11 year old has a strong kick and I am pretty sure that the cheap plastic connectors or the elastic cord are going to break after a little use.I guess for the price you cant expect much, but I would pay more for something designed to last. This is more a toy than a serious training aid."
2,Very weak bungee cord!!!,"This would be an excellent trainer, however, the bungee cord is very weak and has broken twice. I wouldn't recommend buying this product the way it is made. Why should you have to buy a stronger bungee cord after you have purchased a product? It didn't last an hour. It was a complete waste of money and a lousy Christmas gift for my son."
4,Works great. Son was having a good time,Only downside is that my son is a little to thin for the belt. Would work for anyone with probably up to about a 30 waste.Hopefully he will grow into it. I just have to feed him more.
4,Secret Santa,Bought for a secret santa gift for a child in my son's U11 team - they loved and so it gave the coaches a good laugh
2,"An easy read, but not that great...","This book was added to my fluff reading list, and it wasn't that great. The main character is a neurotic twenty-something bent on having a boyfriend. And you guessed it... she works in journalism as an editor. She isn't entirely happy with her career, so much of her life revolves around finding a boyfriend. The book does have some humorous moments, but it just wasn't captivating. Interestingly enough, the plot was set in Boston instead of England like some of the other books in this genre for young professional single women."
4,"Jackie isn't Bridget and thank you, Sarah!","Oh, please, spare me the quickly written review of any novel involving a single woman since the publication of Bridget's adventures in boyland. Not all single women are named Bridget and not all tales can be measured against one experience. I'm single and I don't tire of reading about the diverse trials and tribulations of what we women encounter; how we mend from dating disasters; how our friends rally to our aid, which is a constant because there is the pre-dating the guy advice, the during the dating advice and the break-up advice. Jackie is part of our lives' rich tapestries and her adventures are lush, humorous and oh-so-familiar because they aren't about Bridget they are about us! Must read and a quick cloud lifter--you'll laugh too often to feel that dink of dating depression."
5,A Must Read!,"I started reading this book late one night and after the firstchapter, I couldn't put it down. The author displays a remarkable understanding of relationship issues affecting young adults. I can't wait for the next book in this series!"
3,"Cute, Funny","I was interested in reading this book since the writer comes from Montreal, as do I, and I reside in Boston. It was very cute, pretty funny, I could relate to the type of humor Mlynowski uses. Definitely for a 20-something group. Congatulations to the author on her first book."
4,Likable,"I liked this book. I noticed a few spelling errors which was ironic because of the narrator's job. It was a quick read but I loved how quick and neurotic she was. I, too, would have liked more at the end."
4,Fun Chick Lit.,"My first book by this author and I was not disappointed. I enjoy chick lit and have been increasingly frustrated by all the dismal examples of this genre out there. Milkrun was fun, entertaining, fast paced and believable. I got a little annoyed with the lead character as she tripped in and out of some stupid dating encounters - but then reminded myself that heck, havent we all done similar stupid things?! Especially after having our hearts broken. LOL The first person narration worked really well and Mlynowski does dialogue exceptionally well. A very good piece of chick lit. Will defn be reading more by this author."
2,Blech.,"I've read a few chicklit books in my time, so I'm not particularly surprised when these turn out to be formulaic and derivative. But what really set me off in this book was the fact that the main character was a copy editor -- and the book was rife with misspellings and misused words! (""Jeffery"" instead of ""Jeffrey"" comes immediately to mind). Don't waste your time -- there are plenty of other books in this genre that will make you smile instead of make you pull out your red pencil."
4,As (or more) satisfying as a glass of milk with cookies,"As yet another fan of the Bridget Jones genre, I found this book to be a slight but breezy and enjoyable read. Autor Sarah Mlynowski has a unique voice and a sassy sense of humor, both of which flow freely through her pages. While I myself have never been--and never will be---the bar-hopping type, I found it easy to identify with protagonist Jackie and her search for a mate, and I loved the many references to her work as a copy editor at a romance publishing house."
1,Lactose Intolerant,"...Milkrun was among the most painful reading experiences of my entire life (and I am a rather promiscuous reader). It was entirely predictable (the only chicklit trope not trotted out for our delectation was the fabulous gay friend), clunkily conceived, poorly edited (as many others have pointed out), even more poorly imagined, and the writing was just bad. There's no other way to say it.I loved See Jane Date, and I really admire RD Inc for publishing young female authors who might not otherwise get the chance, but you've got to think--there are reasons they might not otherwise get the chance. ..."
5,A terriffic read!,"This is not my first venture into Chick Lit, nor will it be my last, but Mlynowski is bar far one of the best writing in the genre right now. She has great character development, and some of the moments will literally have you laughing out loud (I would know, I got some weird looks on the plane while reading it). Sure, the story is familiar, but when is it not with these kind of books? This is Mlynowski's first novel but she already puts herself leaps and bounds above some women writing in the genre, such as Clare Naylor. Enjoy this one, and do what I did, which is run out and buy Fishbowl, her second novel!"
4,More Bridget Jones girl power!,"Apparently I am an avid reader of the ""Bridget Jones"" genre of books. I really enjoyed this book. The characters were real and likable and the emphasis was on girl power. Its great how the main character can over come the heartbreak of her jerk bf Jeremy and move on... but without a hilarious and haphazard journey. Definitely good read especially for single gals in their 20's. Makes you feel like you arent alone!"
5,Milkrun is adorable!,"This book is a big favorite of mine. So far it is in the top of it's class compared to all of the other ""life at twenty-something"" books out there. REALLY funny!"
4,Quick Read ... One day engrossed in what is way too familiar,"wow! great 1st book for a new author .. rivals the british authors .. read in one day while travelling .. quick, interesting read ... not too far-fetched and some scenes are just way too close to home ... couldn't put it down"
5,Hilarious!,"Many ""chic lit"" books claim to be ""funny,"" ""witty,"" or ""humorous"". And of those I've read, it's true some have made me laugh, laugh out loud even. But Milkrun had me ROLLING on the floor!This is a hilarious look at dating and guys. I was reading it before class one day, and after a quiz before other students were done I decided to pick it up and read a little more. Unfortunetly, I had to put it down because I couldn't stop laughing out loud!Mlynowski has a witty writing style and a humorous look on life. The story isn't half bad either, not to say it has much of a plot, but the humor carries it. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a light read that will make them laugh HARD."
2,"Sloppy, vapid chic's lit","Normally, I enjoy a light read of this genre, but this book doesn't stack up. The plot was uninspired with a totally predictable ending. The characters were unsympathetic. But the poor editing (misspellings, etc.) was almost humorous in light of the fact that the protagonist is a BOOK EDITOR!I am accustomed (and expect) to non-American English language from novels based overseas, but in this book, it made no sense... i.e., ""University"" instead of ""College"", ""Call Display"" instead of ""Caller ID"" - a minor nitpick, but I think shows the attention to detail the publisher used when getting this book on the market.Pass this up - there are more than enough good books of this ilk to occupy your time!"
1,low-budget Bridget,"I have to agree with the Dallas reader. Maybe I shouldn't have used this book to crush out a cigarette at page 63, but man, it's too painful to read any further. All this book really seems to do is babble about stupid minutiae. Hey, I like chick lit as much as the next, but come on. Don't insult me with this dribble. Read The Parker Grey Show instead. The editing is much better and the main character is so much more interesting."
4,Another winner from Red Dress Ink,"These little books are highly addictive! Milkrun is another novel about a 20-something single, professional woman. This novel is set in Boston, and I enjoyed the change of setting. (Not that I'm tired of reading about NYC or London!) Jackie's roommate and her boyfriend are a source of many chuckles, as are her two best friends. I enjoyed the characters in this book, and while the plot is pretty run of the mill, this is an enjoyable read."
3,Amusing though not original,I enjoyed reading this book but it was predictable right down to the last page. This genre is getting played out.
1,Was this book edited?,"On pp. 14-15, the author has the narrator reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in a ""Twentieth Century American Prose"" class. The author supposedly has a degree in literature. God save higher education!"
2,Milkrun,"I bought the book as listed ""New"" to replace a book I lost from the Public Library.Unfortunately at the Library did not consider the book new and I have to pay a lot more. Sorry, not happy with the purchased."
5,Extremely relate-able,"I am not a huge reader, but I found myself constantly wanting to read this book to see what happened next to Jacqueline, the main character. I could really relate to her story, as I myself am going through a breakup and don't have many single friends of my own. Her experiences reminded me of my own, and I pictured that Jackie is someone I would be friends with. Despite some editing mistakes (spelling, grammar), this book was a playful, light read which made me feel a lot better about my own experiences and realize that I'm not alone. I would definitely recommend this book to any newly single twenty-something year olds having trouble identifying where they belong."
5,LAUGH-OUT-LOUD FUNNY!!!,"This fast,funny read grabbed me from page one. I loved being in the twenty-something mind of Jackie Morris, whose buoyancy in the face of her break-up was inspiring. Bring on the knee-high boots, I'm ready to face the world single again after reading Sarah Mlynowski's book!!! Looking forward to more from this talented writer."
2,Good first attempt at a book,"I agree with ""how did this book get published"" (Dec/2001). Through the beginning of this book I thought I was going to die. The writing style reminded me of the first short story I ever wrote (when I was 8). There was not enough content, and way too much babbling.Luckily, the author's writing style changes at some point & then the book is just a cute story. If I'd been the publisher, I would have demanded the beginning be re-written, but hey, I'm not them.This book is a 20-something Sex in the City / Bridget Jone's Diary wanna-be. It does an ok job at doing that too, but is not extremely original."
2,Boston??,"To be honest I couldnt finish the book. It supposedly took place in Boston - all of these supposed bars don't exist - which being a resident of Boston made it very frustrating. It should have just taken place in Springfield, USA. It was very generic and ruined the story. For all Bostonites its easy to know that no DQ exists in the city nor parking anywhere! I hope no one who reads this book thinks any of these places exist. I recognize its a ficiton book but there have been many books that take place in Boston (ie. Living Single) that use actual places. Tsk tsk!"
3,So so if you aren't looking for much,"This isn't a bad book, it's just not interesting. Jackie, unfortunately, isn't particularly likeable. She's not a bad person, she's just self-centered and shallow, and her affairs are pretty boring, so you can't find yourself rooting for her. An adult who looks forward to an evening out by saying ""Yay, I'm going to get drunk! I'm going to have fun!"" doesn't really rate an entire book, not even chick-lit fluff.Mlynowski probably has a decent novel in her, and since this is her first attempt I will check back in the future when she's gotten a bit more practice. She's got the talent to write; she just needs to find a story."
4,A tragic-comic love story....,"Jackie's boyfriend went away to ""find himself"" and she is determined to not let it get to her. She will become a party girl in her gorgeous new boots with her gorgeous friends and love will just....find her. Only what does find her is a few really bad dates, traumas in the love lives of her friends, a few sloppy drunk nights, a bad idea trip to New York to see the ""ex"", and a chance train wreck that makes her rethink where her heart really wants to be. This is a very cute, often funny, and very fast read. Enjoy!"
2,"I'm not a copy editor, but...","Plot-wise, Mlynowski's novel is cute, a typical entry in the single-girl genre. The only thing that stands out about it is the INCREDIBLY shoddy editing! I find it ironic that a book with a protagonist who is a copy editor is so full of errors: ""you're"" used for ""your,"" ""their"" used for ""there,"" etc. Frankly, I just couldn't get past the errors to enjoy the story. Maybe if the story had been stronger, something more than just ""cute,"" it could have overcome this major hurdle...but I doubt it."
2,Sloppy Story and Writing,"This is easily the lousiest ""chic lit"" book I've read. The writing is bland and the characters are poorly fleshed out. More than once the author gets lazy and doesn't even bother to create a character herself but invokes a well-known character in pop culture and expects the reader to just insert that well-known character into her novel. For example, the main character is ""Sarah Jessica Parker, but prettier."" Her office mate is ""Lillith,"" from Cheers and the show Frazier.The main character is the least endearing of any I've seen in a ""chic lit"" book, which is a bad thing considering that so much of the pleasure of reading these novels hinges on the ride the main character takes the reader on. I would analyze the storyline for you but it's so weak I've nearly completely forgotten it already."
2,milkrun for another book,"I must admit there were a few instances in ""Milkrun"" when I laughed, but for the most part I was disappointed. Jackie repeatedly describes herself as ""intelligent,"" yet I didn't see any actual proof of this in her behavior. For instance, how could she not guess that her copyeditor-superior (I forget her name) had written a book she had Jackie review? Perhaps Mlynowski was trying to give only subtle hints to the reader, but to have Jackie act so obliviously makes me think Jackie is kidding herself when she thinks she's smart.My advice: Run for another book."
4,Very useful product,"I bought it for my mom and she has been able to use it well. It does wrinkle up in some places, but that maybe due to incorrect usage."
3,Weird sizing,"I wear 8.5/9 (US) shoes. I bought the medium regular stockings. The toe was a giant mass of flapping cloth. If I put the heel over my heel, I had floppy flippers at the toe (the tops did stop just short of my knee, though). If I put my toe in the toe pocket, the heel was up past my ankle, and the compression was not in the right place on my foot (the tops also went well above my knee).If you have really looooong toes and/or feet, this may be perfect for you, but they didn't work for me."
2,Buy Jobst Brand Instead!,These stockings are not as durable as you would think. They wore a hole in less than a week. Buy Jobst brand instead!!
1,"poor quality, uncomfortable.","You get what you pay for. I returned this product. I recommend jobst brand, excellent quality worth the price."
5,Relife for my legs,These are the best Anti-Embolism compression stockings for the $$$ I have used. I used them on a resent cross country driving trip and they worked great.I recommend them to others.
1,THIS DVD IS TERRIBLE !!!,"Don't waste your time with this DVD.The ""hyphy"" movement is not ""exposed"" here. It's just an hour and a half of cars doing donuts in the street. And that is it. Almost nothing else.There is very little dancing, no good music, no girls getting funky, ZERO fights, ZERO car crashes, and almost no entertaining ""hyphy"" action.The DVD case says ""Fights"" and ""Car Crashes"" and there are NONE. Zero.Someone should open a class action lawsuit against Figure 8 Productions because this is blatant false advertising.This is just a repackaged ""sideshow"" DVD. Cars, cars, and more cars. This video is beyond boring."
4,Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!,"This warts-and-all autobiography traces figure-skater Galindo's life from early childhood to his turning pro. Not too long ago Rudy was the no. 1 male figure skater in the USA and no. 3 worldwide; the story of how he triumphed over a dysfunctional, near-povery-level background is inspiring and uplifting. Although gay, Rudy perpetually casts himself as the ""All-American"" kid. Time and again the conservative skating authorities told him his costumes were a bit too flamboyant, his wrists too slack to win the big-time points; to his credit Rudy ignored them and won anyway. Though some may find it a bit too emotional, ""Icebreaker"" is a winner, and anyone who still thinks gays lack grit would do well to check it out."
2,Poor quality latch,"The ""antique brass finished"" latch that is supposed to hold the umbrella closed is cheap pot metal that is so poorly fit to the shaft that it only barely holds the umbrella closed. A slight jostle and it flies open, showering you and your friends with water. This is the second of these in a row that has had this defect. As with other things in life that are attractive but lack substance, don't let yourself be tempted."
4,Quite good for the price,"While mine broke thanks to gale-force winds, it held up admirably in the meantime. It is so hard to find a full-size umbrella that's not a golf umbrella. All these collapsible ones are trash, but you don't get that with a full-size one. Plus, this looks classy as you can get for under a hundred dollars"
3,Excellent Design But Had Excessive Vibration,"This router is a well designed unit ergonomically, with excellent height adjustment and quick locking lever. A trial run on my unit revealed what I considered excessive vibration. After some investigating I discovered that the tapered I.D. of the collet holder had runout of .005"" to .006"" when checked with a dial indicator. This was a disappointment to discover but probably was the cause of the abnormal level of vibration. I didn't have the luxury of time to contact Milwaukee customer service to resolve the vibration problem as I was in the middle of a project and needed a router that worked properly. So I returned it and purchased a Porter-Cable unit that had the same base plate mounting hole pattern. I really believe the Milwaukee 5615-21 is a better router and would have preferred to keep it had it not had the bad collet holder."
3,Up in smoke,"I have always believed in spending a little more money to get a higher quality tool that will last for a fair amount of time and Milwaukee has had a reputation of making if nothing else a high quality motor for their tools. well I bought this routher about 6 years ago when it first came out and it worked great for the first 6 years. I am an ocational wood worker........router got used a dozen time a year average. Then one day when routing a channel in some wood it started to smoke and make the worst noises, then with a big flash of blue electrical light it quit. So much for milwaukee having great electrical motors. I'm still on the fence if I will by another milwaukee product again. Sad, but I have to have a tool that will last me more than 6 years will the kind of use I put behind it."
5,Excellent piece of equipment!,"I was in the market for a router and examined several brands. After checking them out I found that the Milwaukee was the easiest for me to use. I've had very good luck with Milwaukee tools and this router is no exception. When I examined the router everything on it made sense and was easy to understand. The height adjustment was the easiest I'd seen. The router came with both 1/4"" and 1/2"" self releasing collets and a hard shell storage case. This is a great piece of equipment. I use it all the time making projects out of oak and it always easily does the job. This is the first router I've owned, and I wasn't sure how well I'd be able to use one. This router is so easy to use and it has allowed me to turn out such nice results that my confidence level has risen dramatically. Just like all my other Milwaukee tools it's built solid. If you need a router you can trust this one."
5,bien en todo,todo bien y en tiempo de a cuerdo a lo planificado el precio bueno y util para lo que lo compre.grasias
4,back to the 60s,"The Mod Squad was a challenging show that I enjoyed as a youngster. The vulnerable Julie, the exiled Pete, and the thoughtful Linc were so cool. We bought this set to see if we would enjoy it even now and still do. Clarence Williams III's (Linc's) perceptive, thoughtful, and athletic portrayal are especially enjoyable. We have found it a vehicle for discussion of drug use, Hollywood's portrayals of certain points of views, of history (ancient since there were no cell phones) with our twelve-year-old daughter. Most of the episodes are high quality, feature good photography, and demonstrate a well-written story. The acting, especially Clarence Williams III's, are excellent. My husband considers Linc's character as the foundational character of the series. If you want a series to discuss and enjoy with your kids, you might try this."
1,USELESS!,"This book was completely, and utterly useless. The 'book' contained absolutely nothing about how to plan a destination wedding. No mention of photographers, Videographer, cake.... This book is purely advertisements for resorts. Excluded was ALL of europe, and 43 states(only 7 states included). The travel tips included were ridiculous, such as ""get two room keys"" DUH"
5,This book helped me figure out where to go for my wedding,"I could never figure out the difference between all the Sandals hotels and the Beaches and Breezes and Superclubs places and this book had each one with a photo and comments from people who had gone there and told me what the difference wasand what was good about it and what wasn't like a small rocky beach or that a place is far from town. I didn't find that type of stuff on websites for the places and Ifound that very very helpful. Also, it is really beautiful looking (the cover anyway) so I keep it on my coffee table and people comment on it. It looks much more costly than the $... I paid for it."
1,Don't Buy This Book,Provides even less information than you can find on the web. Black & white pictures and super large font make this book little more than a paperweight. Don't waste your time.
2,Only buy this if interested in a Carribean Wedding,"This book is okay if you are interested in a Carribean wedding (most resorts are in Jamaica), however, the pricing is already off if some cases up to $1,000. I was very disappointed to see that there were very few destination sites other than tropical. The title should be The Most Romantic Tropical Resorts for Destination Weddings. However, there are a plethora of resorts listed and if you are aching for a beach wedding it gives you plenty of options."
2,Not what I was looking for,"This book is basically 2 pages each for 135 resorts in the Caribbean & gives descriptors like locations for wedding (beach, gazebo, etc), room rates (not helpful at all since it depends on time of year & you can get group rates if you marry there), etc. . Without using this book, I booked my wedding at the Westin in St John & now that I look at the book, some of the information is inaccurate& not really helpful now that I know what the important things to know are...I could've gotten better information about the resorts on fodors.com and definitely got better information by going to resorts' websites (which are easy to find if you can use search engines).This would be more helpful for planning a honeymoon, as you can see all the resorts that are out there but as for planning a DW, it is really not useful..."
2,Don't waste your money,The book uses large fonts and superbig headers. all the info can fit on a half a page but they spread it across 2 pages each. I would not mind this if it had useful info but the stuff is mostly general that you can find on any website and gives one line drab reviews from other people.
1,Don't bother,"This looks like a nice big 3-D book. Actually the top 3/4 of it is a regular picture book of Finding Nemo, with only so-so illustrations. The 3-D pictures are on the bottom part, & are only about 2"" big. It's hard to get the viewer lined up right to see it, & even when you do, it is a very poor 3-D effect. This book was a waste of money."
1,Fiction at Best,"I met and worked with Pascucci years ago and the ego and arrogance he portrayed in the book are very accurate. However the details of his career are full of fiction. Although he did rise up high in the Marshals Service, he ended his career in disgrace when he was arrested by the FBI for extortion. (a subject which he just glossed over at the end of the book). He was convicted of that crime and did time in the federal prison system. As I read this book years ago, I got disgusted with his twisting of the truth and his self-glorification, because I knew better. Pascucci might spin a good action tale, but he is absolutely not a hero. With that being said, the book is full of action and is not a bad read if taken with a grain of salt."
1,Manhunter: He should hunt for the truth.,"I will keep this short. Being a police officer with over twelve years of experience, having worked with U.S. Marshals, and having been assigned to a Federal Task Force, I can assure you there is more fiction than truth in this book. I read this garbage and immediately gave it away to a charitable organization as soon as I finished it. I wasted money on this one."
5,Enjoyed the book,"That the author gets the job done in landing some dirtbags is admirable. That he had great passion for his job is exemplary. That he pissed some people off is expected. That he crossed the line is unfortunate--especially for the bad guys. These elements add up to an entertaining book. --Roger Weston, author ofFatal Return"
4,for $0.01 - nice variation on Cop-Autobiography,"While the other reviewers may call the author names, none dispute that he actually was a US Marshal etc.If you had to read only one cop-autobio, I think you'll get more enlightenment from John Douglas' MINDHUNTER. But having read that, you would get a broader picture by reading Pascucci, rather than getting more-of-the-same from say one of Douglas's sequels.EITHER of these quality-cop-autobios can be had for less than a dollar used - great bargains, relative to say pure fiction."
1,Good deeds ruined by bad writing!,"I actually enjoyed some of this book. That is only because I blanked out the fact this book was written as non-fiction. As a dime novel, this book was only lacking good artwork! I'm not sure if this book was written in Pascucci's own words, or ghostwritten by Stauth. For Pascucci's sake, I hope it was simply embellishment by an enthusiastic co-author. Phrases such as, ""I like to blow big holes in bad people,"" had me cringing. This guy should be writing scripts in B-movies. Unfortunately, the cartoonish dialogue detracted from what might have been an interesting read."
2,He was good but.......,"Basically Pascucci was one hardcore marshal, and did things most of us will never do. He went into great detail about his adventures, but he also tried to B.S. his away around the reasons he was kicked out of the Marshals Svc. Other than that the book was a decent read. The only other complaint was his rip-off of John Douglas' ""The Mindhunter"" cover. Was it just a coincidence..Manhunter...Mindhunter..the cover of the books are to similar to be accidental."
3,Advanced Algebra - I don't think so!,"This book places more emphasis on the calculators ability to do the work for you, it doesn't explain what the calculator is doing in order to get the solution.Its really aimed at high school kids who don't have any knowledge of calculus and the mathematical jokes don't win any prizes. Overall I would reccomend you go for a maths book and not this book."
1,not worth it...,"this is just a documentury that you hear no full songs by korn and no members of korn are even in this talking or anything... if you're a korn fan and know thier ""basic"" past and rise to fame than their is no need buying this dvd... ...STEVE-O..."
1,Nothing special..,"This book is a joke! All of the exercises are the beginning basic Pilates mat exercises, with slight variations. The exercises and photos are repeated 2 and 3 times throughout the book. There is nothing special or specific for post pregnant women...I was very disappointed since the author was supposed to be an expert in the field."
5,A Superb Book,"Most informative and well written, the editor is to be congratulated for compiling this interesting collection."
2,great for a while and then the infamous static problem,"These speakers are gr8, while they work. After about a year, I started seeing the first signs of static problem but it used to go away after a while. However it got progressively worse over time and now its just unbearable. The loud sudden booms from the woofer are scary as hell when ur not expecting them.Ill talk to Logitech customer support, but I doubt they will do anything after 2 years. If they do replace them, then im gonna bump up the ratings to a 4."
5,Long Term Review,"Pros:I am pleased to say that these speakers have been pumping sweet highs and throaty lows consistently for the entire year I've had them. This is this first product I've ever felt strongly enough about to actually write a review on amazon. They are just that good. I've got them plugged up to a zd7000 HP laptop and they reproduce great sound from just about anything I throw at them; they've been able to handle music from iTunes, DVD movie soundtracks, and f/x from pc games. I've also used them to play music straight from portable cd players and every once in a while from BOSS sound samplers. These speakers are quality built, durable, and overall a good value. The included headphone jack on the remote is an added bonus, and the setup was quick and easy.Cons:Although the subwoofer is more than adequate to shake the room, they can be boomy on certain types of music (hip hop, heavier rock). I usually handle this by adjusting some equalizer settings."
1,4 days later and mine still hasn't shipped,"True, estimates aren't guarantees, but - in my experience - this is typical. Annoying. I guess it will be a LATE birthday present."
1,17 days later and mine still hasn't shipped,They just give me the run around when I call or email which I have done several times now. And it's STILL listed as shipping in 24 hours. I think Amazon doesn't have enough competition.
5,Freaking amazing.,Power! I can only turn this thing up 1/4 way before my ears are hurting I have yet to turn it up halfway. The satellites are clear and the bass is strong and deep. The remote is very cool the blue LED is strong and the bass and volume knobs are very handy. There is a headphone jack on there also. Just what i expected with THX and logitech
3,Good for the price,"This is a nice speaker set for the money (I paid $109), but I am not quite as enthusiastic as most other reviewers seem to be. If you dig into the specs, you'll see the advertised wattage output is with 10% THD (distortion), which is absurdly high (most systems are well below 1% THD). Additionally, since the cords are integral (attached) to the speakers, you are a bit limited in your speaker placement options.The construction is solid and well finished. The wired remote with volume, bass and power controls and headphone jack are nice. The blue light didn't bother me. The sound was good at the desk, but not great in the rest of the room (probably due to speaker placement)."
3,Died within 2 months,"After researching dozens of products I decided to go with these and skip a 5.1 setup. Sure, they sound good, no complaints really. The only major one I have is that I live in an apartment. The bass is too loud, even when turned ALL the way down. This makes it very annoying when playing games at night.After 2 months I started to get extremely loud static/popping in my left speaker. Even with the volume ALL the way off. It's the LEFT jack on the subwoofer that went bad. It's not the soundcard. It does this if I switch around the speakers and even without it connected to anything. I've also tried moving the speaker far away from anything else and still get the same thing.I'll probably go out today and get a different brand. Anyway, these are great i'm sure if they last. If they died for you, i'm sure you'd be giving them the same review."
2,Speakers and Static,"Initially i was quite impressed by the quality of sound from these relatively in expensive speaker but as some one else pointed out, with in weeks i started receiving static from my LEFT speaker (why only LEFT.........I dont know) but it is terribly annoying. Now i am back to listening my music on headphone and i wonder why i bought them. I visited logitech's product support site and that was no help. I guess there is reason why they are discounting these speakers so much.Be informed about the static problem while making your decision."
5,Size does matter,5 Stars says it all. Very good for the price (...). These speakers and subwoofer are bigger than I thought from looking at the picture. I love the blue LED on the remote; it matches my power/HD LEDs on my case :)
5,completely phenomenal!,"Opeth has become my favorite band over the last year, and if you check this release out, you'll see why. mikael ackerfeldt has got to be one of the best vocalists ever! there is never a dull moment on this album, or any opeth releases. if you like metal, CHECK IT OUT! i can't stress enough what an intense and awesome release this is. opeth magically finds a way to make death metal musical and progressive, never ceasing to amaze me with their keen musical skills. this album is flawless."
4,"quite different style of music, but I love it...","This was hard to get into at first, but it truly is a great work of art. I love songs like April Ethereal, Madrigal, Demon of the Fall, Karma, and Epilogue...the vocalist has a very smooth voice which anybody singing classically can learn a thing from somewhat....buy this!"
3,Has Its Moments,"This album is not that bad and there are a few good moments, but for the most part, it just doesn't gel with me. My biggest problem is with some of the longer pieces and the guitar meandering that just doesn't sound right.The musicianship is excellent and there are some pretty decent tunes, but overall, this disc just didn't blow me away. Maybe some of their other material will sound better but I can't say this was the best introduction to Opeth."
3,Not as good as said,"I really love Opeth. I do. But this album is no masterpiece. In fact, it's pretty much their lowest point. There aren't any great melodies or guitar solos (except 2, which i'll get to in a second), the production is crap, and the whole album is a whole lot of the same. I do give them props for the lyrical concept, but that still doesnt justify calling this album ""great"".The albums shining moment, however, is the song ""April Ethereal"". This is one of the best, if not THE best, song the band has ever done. Great melody and solo. The other song i liked was ""Epilogue"" and their cover of Maiden's ""Remeber Tomorrow"" is great as well.If you're an Opeth fan, buy this album. If you're getting one for the 1st time, buy ""Still Life"" or ""Morningrise"" instead."
2,Utterly disappointing,"Having absolutely loved the previous Opeth albums Orchid and Morning Rise (maybe in my top 5 ever) I am incredulous that this album was so disappointing.Instead of the beautifully crafted, complex, atmospheric, variety of their previous works, I was constantly frustrated by the 'wall-of-sound' production, the blurred regression to black metal rather than their previous ultra crisp and clearly defined heaviness, contrasted with ethereal acoustic breaks.The drums are in the background, the guitars are a blur of buzzy sound-the whole mix and production sounds awful relative to their previous masterpieces.Ironically-Still Life, their next album, recaptures that Opeth sound that I love-weird but true.Give this one a big miss or approach with caution-it is NOT like their other albums, and the change i feel does not work at all."
5,Outstanding,"Opeth's My Arms Your Hearse is a dark, brutal, conceptual album. Production was improved dramaticaly since Morningrise. As many other reviewers said before, the bass is actually buried under the other instruments while the guitars sound in front. So, there's no bass like in Morningrise (too bad).The riffs on MAYH change rythm constantly and show some interesting technicality, first Opeth virtue: the amazing use of octaves and full chords, not ""power chords only"". Not too much guitar solos, as always in Opeth albums, in fact, this is one of their greatest virtues: Not showing off!!!The vocals are just right, i really DO think that growling is necesary. The effects on Demon Of The Fall are so well used, they fit incredibly well in the context of the song.The ""clean vocals"" passages are beautiful, really.Outstanding performance, this band has become my n1 band of all time, moving the always-talented-always-showing-off Dream Theater to a second place."
2,Display Quit Working,As others have noted - the display quits working after about 12 months. Worked great until then but don't recommend it now!
1,Display went out completely - avoid this one!,"My display also quit working just after it went out of warranty (1 year). There is obviously an issue with these. Since Panasonic is not addressing it, I suggest you avoid this one!"
1,Blank Display and just about worthless,I've owned this product for 14 months and it's had no display for a month and a half. The display just went blank just after the warranty went out(12 months) I bought this system for a nice little sound system for limited use but it's a pig. The remote is a CF with no easy way to get from here to there. Getting the DVD's out is a pain too the thing either spits them all out so you can't any but the top one out or you have to guess as to which slot is empty. Now it's going to cost me 1/3 of the purchase price to fix something I barely used. It works but you have to guess as to what the thing is doing and with the miserably put together remote ... is just sucks... I replaced a cheap Sony unit for this ..BAD MOVE ! Zero STARS
1,Panasonic SC HT830V,Panasonic SC-HT830V 5-Disc DVD/VCR Combo Home Theater SystemI bought this system because of favorable reviews on the web.Unfortunately the people that rated it did not have long enough for thedisplay panel to die.I got 14 months out of mine before the display diedalmost impossible to use with out this.Replacment board is not availableDo not buy this product.
1,Display not working,Just like many others are complaining the display stopped working a few weeks before warranty expired. I did not have a chance to call tech support to get it fix and now they won't fix it. I thought panasonic made good products and in fact they were on top of my list until now.
3,Did manage to get my display fixed,Not sure how he did but the local tv electronics guy managed to fix my display when it went out without any problems for around [...]
1,Display problem is typical,"I have had my SC-HT830V system for just under three years (almost to the day). It has not been on my primary TV, so I would say that this system has had extremely limited use, compared to a daily user. Today, the system's display has gone blank - just as so many others have reported.I called Panasonic and was instructed to take it ot the certified service center, who will evaluate it and provide an estimate. The customer service person said Panasonic may provide help in paying for the problem.We'll see how the service center handles it. I'll be pretty angry if Panasonic doesn't step up and cover this, considering the problem is widespread with this system.Otherwise, I've been pleased with it. Great sound, pretty easy to assemble, but a nightmare of a remote, frankly. Will be next to impossible to use without the display though, since all sound functions (bass, adjustments to sound type, etc) are through that."
2,Fails after a year,"The 5 CD changer refused to close after 1 year two weeks. I eventually had to forcefully push cd tray # 1 back in and just use trays 2-5. (Yes I know you are not supposed to force it back in, but I ran out of options.) After two more weeks the LED display went out. All I can use it for now is sound. The lack of a display makes its really hard to tell what mode you are in or how loud the speakers are. Looking for a replacement."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I bought this book at a traditional book store -- it was on a discount to only $10.00 and I still think that I overpaid. I found many of the questions irrelevant to the step 2 testing environment, and some of the answers were just flat out wrong, and the book is only one year after publication. Explanations were also inadequate.I would recommend purchasing one of the online question banks if you have the means - Q-bank is most like the boards, USMLEworld is significantly harder and less relevant, but both are far superior to this book. Save your money."
1,This guy knows so little about Nietzsche...,"When you read isolated phrases from Nietzsche, it's easy to misinterpret him. Just read a little further though, and you'll start getting a clearer picture. That's what the nazis didn't do (being handed edited material by his nazi sister). Neither did this liberalist documentarist."
1,Five minutes in and he's full of it.,"The narrator starts off with the typical anglicized version of history, and therefore lost me immediately. In comparing how some cultures rise and some don't, he asks why did the French Revolution result in a bloodbath while the American revolution didn't, which of course ignores the Second American Revolution(The Civil War) completely.Then he talks about how Hitler killed 20 million, but ignores Britain killing the same amount in India. This is one of the most amateurish productions you can imagine, its not something you spend money on(I saw it on Netflix) its something that should be free on youtube. You've been warned."
1,Nietzsche and the nazis,The sound does NOT work on the entire DVD. Turning the sound up does not help. Please advise. Thank you.
1,I wish I could give it a 0 out of 5,"Simplistic argumentation begins at the outset with his refuting of ""weak explanations"" for the Nazi regime and continues throughout. It's shocking that the writer maintains a position at a university, given his third-rate philosophizing. This is seriously terrible. It's on YouTube if you need to confirm, but don't waste your money on this."
1,I cannot recommend this book.,"I obtained this book expecting some real help to understand the financial implications of Alzheimer's Disease. Instead what I got was a simple recitation of what any Senior Citizen already knows that applies to all elderly people. Mainly, get rid of your assets before entering a nursing home. The ""legal advice"" in this book is of the most simplistic nature. I feel misled and out another $25.00 I can't afford. AARP sends out free pamphlets with better advice."
2,Not Non-stick,"Though the description boasts of a non-stick surface, it is anything but. The coating seems to be nothing more than gray metallic paint. Oil of some sort is necessary to get the eggs to release - spray is the easiest. As others have mentioned a large egg is pushing the capacity of the poacher. It does work, but not much better that a pan of water.One bright spot - the slots in the top do work well, allowing a fork (placed into the slot) to be used to remove the poacher from the pan."
3,The eggs still stick sometimes,"I really don't use this much, because the eggs still stick, and I just don't want to fuss with it."
1,Eggs stick to so-called 'non-stick',"It's really simple - don't call it non-stick if it's not. I washed the item, then used it to cook two eggs. They stuck. If you have to spray anything on it first, the it's not non-stick. I'm so tired of being lied to. It's a PoC pure and simple."
2,3 egg poacher is an odd number,"I have had this poacher for awhile now and no matter what we try the eggs leave a film that is very hard to get off, tried sprays, etc. But what is more interesting, or not, is the 3 spots. Not sure what we were thinking when we bought it. For the two of us, one person has to eat while the other ""set"" is being made."
2,Not the ideal poacher,"I have tried different poachers as I am looking for one that is definitely non stick. This one is compact and fits into a small pan but even using spray oil or butter, still sticks and is difficult to clean. Have to leave to soak. Hope I can find a better one."
4,A sleeper book of poetry.,"I bought this book in a general store in North Carolina and I must say it is pretty good. Hubinger uses a wide variety of nature, social issues, emotion and pop culture to weave his poems together. Some highlights of the book are ""Sea Drums"", ""The Chapel of Memories"", ""Do Miss the Cormorant"" & ""Catman"".As for a contemporary poet, some of his poems have a Billy Collins feel to it. Others might even have a throwback element to some poets such as Plath or Dickinson. However, being an amateur poet and photographer (another one of Hubinger's skills), I found this book entertaining."
3,Ok if you are new to jazz piano,"I was looking for some ideas to improve my solo jazz piano playing, but found that if you are in any way a performing jazz pianist, you will find most of the exercises in this book are already familiar to you. It focuses a lot on walking bass lines. I was hoping for a little more in the way of ideas for intros reharm and such. A good book if you are not all too familiar with jazz piano playing, but not for anyone who is at more than intermediate level."
3,Poor Binding! Careful!,"When a book is focused on teaching jazz piano you would expect it to be able to rest easily on a piano or a music stand in order to be read. Unfortunately the binding is such that the book is always closing and the pages never stay open. The first time I used it I tried to ""open the book"" just a little bit so that the pages would stay open and I wouldn't have to hold them. Much to my surprise, the very first time I LIGHTLY folded the pages back, the pages fell out of the binding completely! It was like snapping a dried twig. Now I have a broken book with pages falling out of it.Bottom line: Content is decent, but the binding is horrendous and renders the book useless."
4,Great beginning!,This is a good book for someone with basic Jazz theory knowledge. You still need have some foundation of Music Theory. It's a good book to be taken with supplemental teaching! Great recording eventhough does not follow the book(mostly his own voice leading).Thanks for creating effort and teaching for those of us that involve with music and love of it!
1,olmstead jazz book,"This book contains no sheet music improvisation recorded on a CD, which is a pity because they are interesting, this is the biggest mistake of the author;"
3,Good Value,"Rug is nice quality, nice size. My only complaint is that there was some small black oil spots on the front of the mat. The spots were very small and you couldn't notice them when they were on the floor so I didn't try to scrub them off. Also the mat had an odor like gasoline sort of. I like this mat and would buy it again, but that is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5."
5,Chris Isaak Wicked Game,This was my second purchase from amazon.com and the experience was a pleasure. My purchase came a full day early and in perfect condition. Thank you once more amazon.com.
3,"Great music, but CD is too short!","After he has recorded for 20 years, ""The Best of Chris Isaak"" is finally released. Cause for celebration? Yes and no. Chris Isaak makes vibrant, terrific music, but to have a best-of CD clock in at under 63 minutes is just shameful. Where is ""Don't Make Me Dream About You?"" That song was a hit, for Pete's sake! And it's a great tune, to boot. Excluding this song would have been somewhat forgivable if the CD didn't have 17 minutes of unused space on it!This CD is a let-down. Long-time fans like me (and new fans!) should have been treated to a true restrospective of Isaak's work form the last 20 years. Instead, we get short-changed.On the plus side, the CD's remastering sounds great. It's good to have those old songs with great sound quality."
2,Sound Check For This CD Please!,"I have all Chris Isaak CDs in my music library. 02 of them are HDCD encoded (Speak Of The Devil & Baja Sessions). The studio has finally released this title CD ""Best of Chris Issak"" even without HDCD logo printed on the CD cover, the CD is HDCD encoded which is a plus for critical audiophiles since most Chris Issak CDs have great sound! Unfortunately NOT in this case! All original songs were badly remixed and remastered even though they were encoded with HDCD! A big disappointment for Issak fans and critical audiophiles like myself! Anyone can make a much better compilation out of Isaak CDs than this compilation! This CD is NOT recommended!"
1,Dissapointing compilation of a great singer's career...,"Unfortunately, living in South America (this is my case) forces you to buy what the local market has to offer.Got this CI Greatest Hits compílation in a edition... made in Colombia.The sound is terribly high-pitched. The booklet print quality is miserable (imagine the worst bootleg version).The song selection is also bad... Not included his great performances of Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"" and ""I Want Your Love"".Think that the 'great' compilators at Reprise Records, made one of their worst works with this album... Chris Isaak, being an awesome singer/performer, deserves a much better compilation work than this!!!!"
3,"Not MY Favorites, but a good CD","I wrote an earlier review of this CD (now deleted) in which I groused that many of us old fans might not be satisfied with a ""new"" CD with (mostly) songs we have already paid for on it. This might be true especially since those of us out in the middle part of the country never get CI concerts ... however...CI and Silvertone came out to OKC and to Kansas City this past summer, and I was fortunate enough to attend both. Great shows - really. If you are a CI fan like myself, the recharge obtained from going to those shows can hold you until a CD of new music comes out (which I hope is soon). Thanks, guys, for coming out to see us. And, yes, this is a good CD. It doesn't have my personal favorites on it, but that is one of the nice things about CI and Silvertone. Everyone has different favorites."
5,wonderful cd & dvd of Chris Isaak,Received on time and very enjoyable movie and music of Chris Isaak. I forgot how much I enjoyed his music. Thank you.
4,"""Almost"" Best Of...","Chris is such an amazing singer and musician. I've been ""driving"" to this dude's music for years. This album is a keeper because it contains ""most"" of Chris's best tunes. Not all of them. That's the ""curse"" of ""best of"" compilations. But don't worry; this record has enough pure gold to cover all of your teeth.Really, if you have any sense at all, you'll acquire his entire back-catalogue. The guy is beyond magnificent. Get this album if you're just discovering Isaak, but get the first four albums to REALLY grasp his greatness.An American icon."
5,Very enjoyable CD,"I have been a fan of Chris Isaak for a long time. Most of his popular songs are contained in the CD. His style is very versatile, from country-rock to blues. Fast songs and slow songs. He is a terrific lyricist. I ended up playing this CD on vacation in California and it suited the trip perfectly."
4,Best of Chris Issak???,"Huh? Best of Chris Issak?I own every Chris Issak album and love them all, but this compilation is ""odd"" to me. I had to look up a few of these songs because I couldn't remember what album they came from. I'm giving it a 4 because it's still good, but definitely not the best of Chris Issak.If you're new to Chris Issak, buy the following 3 albums San Francisco Days, Forever Blue and Speak of the Devil. Then, for a special treat pick up Baja Sessions."
5,Love this artist,I love this artist and everything he does. This album has all my favorites on it. I love it. I am definitely loving the fact I bought this.
5,Best of Chris Isaak,"After listening to a partial duet of Somebody's Crying with Michael Bublé on his show, I decided to order one of Chris' CD's. This is the first CD I have of his so I figured I couldn't go wrong with getting a ""best of"" selection. I love most of the songs. Love the style and sound of his voice!"
3,Milwaukee 1 3/4 HP Router,"I purchased one of these routers and installed it on my table. It performs average but lacks power when trying to raise panels with an 1/2"" bit. I have to make three passes to complete a cut. The adjustment mechanism tends to bind when trying to raise the bit and most of the time I have to pull out the router and ""help"" the adjustment mechanism. It probably is better suited for edge routing and wouldn't recommend it for a router table. Go for the 3+ hp machines like the Hitachi."
1,Watch out for the gottcha,"The reason I bought a new router is that my old Skil had an automatic chuck that extended to far and I could not use threaded guides to to make dovetail joints. I read that the Milwaukee router has a sub-base that will accept standard 1-3/16 threaded guides so I bought A NEW 1-3/4HP Router. Well, the router doesn't come with the sub-base you have to buy it as an accessory. Amazon doesn't carry it. The milwaukee web site doesn't even mention it. (you can't buy direct from them anyway) So I go to an authorized dealer. They didn't stock it. Their regional warehouse didn't have one. They contacted Milwaukee Tool and the item is back ordered and no one knows when it will be available. GOTTCHASO NOW I HAVE A BRAND NEW ROUTER THAT I CAN'T USEP.S.I was going to buy a Bosch but their system will not accept standard templet guides you have to buy a new set of their special templet guides . GOTTCHA DOUBLEDI SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A PORTER CABLE"
1,Does not hold up,"I am a fiish carpenter who uses 4 routers set up with different bits most days. I have owned this router for nearly 2 years and find myself reaching for any other router other than this one. The strap idea is great, however it takes longer to pick it up, get comfortable and go. The height adjustment is also a good idea, but in the everyday world doesnot offer an advantage over other systems, unless you dedicate this to a router table.My big gripe about this tool is the bearings have failed on me twice in the past nine months. Keep in mind I use this tool only when another router is not available and I have not experienced this problem with my other routers."
1,Major disappointment,"You have major Spanish actresses here, and they are burdened with a shrill, unfunny comedy that turns gay men into sideshow freaks. There is not one believable character in the whole film. It's an unnmitigated disaster."
4,fue muy divertida,"What can I say? This movie was fun, fun, fun. Smart and witty in places, too. Those looking for something serious or more ""true to life"" are missing the point entirely. With high production values, and some of Spain's finest actresses, this film is bound to have a wide base of appeal. And for those of us dependent on subtitles, I can only imagine it would be even more clever in its native tongue."
3,Interesting but infrequent,"I subscribed from late February to mid-June. While the writing was interesting and well done, and the topics were varied, the infrequency of the blog makes it not worth the money for me. There were postings on 4/30, 5/8, and 6/4 as the most recent, and just 15 posts since 2/17 (over a 17 week period in other words). It think to be worth subscribing to, even at the very reasonable 99 cents Amazon charges, publishing frequency needs to be picked up. If you are reading it on line for free, the schedule is fine. For May I paid about a penny a word, given the length of the post made on 5/8. That's not acceptable."
2,Very graphic,And kind of drawn out. It did not hold my attention very well.The Very graphic part turned my stomach even tho it was true.
3,Against All Odds,"The ordering experience was great. The products were delivered in a timely manner and received in great shape. The movie itself was not quite the quality that I would have liked. It was dark and hard to see what was going on in places But the content was great. The amazing power of God and His love and protection of His people is a real comfort. As a child of God I know He is in charge, watching and taking care of me."
5,Great Purchase!,"I bought this as a gift for my mom for Christmas and she said it is absolutely fantastic. My brother even loved it, and he hates watching movies. Can't wait to see it myself. Great history of Israel."
5,Against All DVD,"Great History. Great compilation, great editing, great collection of real clips and narration. This DVD is a collector's edition.Thanks to AMAZON."
3,Bad switch,I would love to give this product 5 stars. My other Milwaukee tools are great. This is a great router when it works. But if you check other Milwaukee router reviews you will find lots of people complaining about the bad switch. Its true. I had to send mine back. Lucky it was still under warranty. The switch has a design flaw and Milwaukee refuses to acknowledge it and fix it. I guess this will be my last Milwaukee tool (sigh). Looks like the bean counters are running the company now and are going to run it into the ground. Sell your stocks!
4,pretty cool huh,"wasn't a bad book seen better. Wish it was like the other zelda game strategy guides, a good thing is that it shows all the seashells"
3,"OK Guide, but don't spoil the fun!","I'm against game guides altogether...I belive they are for losers who don't feel like actaually trying to figure out the game itself. That's supposed to be the fun part. And man, was this game fun. AFTER I beat it, I picked up this guide to see if I missed anything and played through a couple of times over. The fact of the matter is, all I really used the guide for was for the seashells and the heart pieces. You really don't NEED a guide for this game. On top of that, I've seen much better guides than this one for other Zelda games (Versus Book's Perfect Guide for Zelda 64 is awesome). I'd say if you are totally stuck, than this will do the trick, but will it be you who beat the game or some writer at Prima?"
2,Don't seem to be Martex pillows,"We ordered the Martex pillows because we'd had them in a hotel and really liked them. But these arrived, they don't seem the same, and they're not labled Martex anywhere on the pillows, leading us to believe we received a substitution without being informed."
2,Way too fluffy,"Pillows are a nice quality, but too stiff and and firmly fluffy for our tastes. Had to sleep on the corner or make sure you are positioned directly in the middle to avoid neck ache."
1,Too cheap to be true,"The old adage "" you get what you pay for "" is true here. These pillows flatten after one use.... spend your money elsewhere!!!"
2,So so... got flat pretty quickly,"These pillows started out fine, but got flat pretty quickly. I'll probably need to replace them soon, since i was hoping to use them in the guest bedroom. Now the 2 of them are about as full as 1 was in the beginning. I'd probably buy different ones, given the chance again, even at this competitive price."
3,Nice pillows,"Good Pillows, had to switch from down to synthetic, was putting too much strain on my neck, these are doing the job though !"
5,How to Survive in the Puzzle Palace,"If you ever wondered about what it is like to work inside the Pentagon, or what it takes to work on a high level staff, then this book is for you. Although primarily written for Pentagon staffers, this book applies to all staffers at all levels of the military and civilian/private sector. Not a whole lot of theory, just a lot of good, first-hand experience and common sense. This book helped me in previous assignments, and now I refer to it often while assigned to the Pentagon."
3,Of limited value,Good price. flimsy stakes. If you are sticking these in soft earth they are fine. Otherwise the stake is too weak to penetrate grouind
3,Cheap and Functional,"These reflectors work fine for guiding me out of my long unlit driveway at night. Only complaint is that they lack any kind of anchor in the pole so that they do not twist while in the ground. When an extended wind comes around, the wobble in the hole in the ground which widens it and allows the reflector to change direction over time. But, then again you get what you pay for."
5,Rubis Tweezers,I have used this brand for years and wanted a second pair to keep in another room for convenience. Sturdy and very effective!
1,NOT GOOD!,"I RETURNED these back the the retailer. The tips appear to be some kind of High Carbon steel in the photos, BUT instead are plastic. Bad News, They do not work. Best to stick with finely ground Stainless Steel. Germany makes good Tweezers and Scissors."
4,One of the best so far,"I really liked this one. I thought the plot was better developed than the others I have read in this serise (Books 2&3). It was amazing really, the plot kept thickening and thickening until I thought she would never be able to pull it out but she did manage remarkably. Only the fate of Jennifer's family was left out. I enjoyed the main love interests in this one as well. I do tend to go in for tortured lovers but they were really a solid pair. I thought that the superstions of Cornwall made a nice background to the story and were a pleasent change from her usual settings. This book also answerd some questions I had after a previous book. All-in-all a good read but I would definitely recomend reading it in order in the Serise."
1,Seller disregards customer requests when shipment never arrived,"I was super excited when I placed this order, thinking I got a great deal on something I used to have, but my ex-sister-in-law took it when I moved into a condo six years ago ... but anyway ... I waited and waited and waited for the UPS man to drop this new floor mirror by my doorstep. That never happened. I then looked the crazy routing it went through, having never made it to my town or my doorstep, then promptly sent the seller a kind email, explaining the possible reason that it was sent everywhere but to my doorstep. I made it very clear that I still wanted it. The seller never even responded to this email. A few days later, I noticed a refund on my credit card - which is NOT what I wanted. I will never purchase anything from Frenchi again!!! I advise others against it, too!!"
5,AN EXCELLENT READ,"MRS HOWARD AND MR WIMBISH DO A SUPERB JOB IN TELLING THE LIFE AND CAREER OF FORMER YANKEE GREAT ELSTON HOWARD. ELSTON DESERVED A MUCH LONGER LIFE. THIS IS WRITTEN WITH MUCH HONESTY AND SENSITIVTY. . FROM THE JIM CROWE LAWS TO ARROGANCE AND PREJUDICE, ELSTON HOWARD FACED MANY BARRIERS ALONG THE WAY TO STARDOM. HE WAS QUITE A PLAYER AND DESERVED MUCH MORE RECOGNITION. THIS BOOK BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBES THE TRADGEDY, TURMOIL, AND TRIUMPHS THAT CAME TO HIM AND HIS FAMILY. A MUST READ FOR ALL YANKEE FANS AND HISTORIANS OF BASBALL. A GREAT READ."
3,Does not fit Kramer guitar,"This skin does NOT fit the Kramer guitar. It would have been nice to know that before purchasing. Otherwise, my nephew loved it until he discovered he'd have to exchange it. I cannot rate this item overall or for it's ""fun"" factor since it was a gift for my nephew; but since a rating is required, I gave it an average 3 stars. There were no other problems with it that I know of."
2,"surprisingly not very good, unlike previous four seasons","I own the dvd sets for all five years of the Dead Zone, and I am a big fan. However, I was really disappointed with this set. First of all there are only 9 episodes (3 dvds x 3 episodes each) as compared to maybe 16 episodes in the other years. Second, is that the stories suddenly quote weak and far fetched. It seemed like the show got better and better from years 1-4. But then suddenly its not believable. Also, there must have been some contract dispute with Sarah Bannerman because she almost never appears in any of the episodes."
4,Dead Zone Season 5,"It's a lot like the other seasons, but with a darker plot and an even more unsure Johnny Smith. If you like the other seasons, check it out, because there is only one other season after this one...The Dead Zone - The Complete Fifth Season"
2,Sad Little Season 5,"My family have been fans of the Dead Zone for its first 4 seasons. I would give each of those seasons 5 stars, no problem. But this season! Ack! The writing is so abysmal it's really quite funny, and ludicrous episodes like ""Panic"" (which make no sense whatsoever)kept us laughing for 30 minutes until we couldn't take it anymore and turned the DVD off. The Great Conspiracy Plot is a no-brainer and rather dull, the assassinations just plain silly. Who wrote these scripts?? I feel sad for the excellent cast, many of whom are notably absent in this series, perhaps they read the scripts and bailed out before humiliating themselves?"
2,Dead Zone Died,"In the beginning this series was enjoyable. They should have ended it with season three. The Fifth Season is the worst. Anthony Michael Hall (or should I say Johnny Smith, not sure which one I'm watching) BELIEVES he's something special. It's become so cliche taking stabs at politicians, religion... ENOUGH!!!"
3,Already been said...,"This fifth season was a bit disappointing. I mainly purchased this season because I loved the first 3 seasons and then kinda put up with the 4th season. I needed to see where the story was going and if you have the compulsion to finish what you've started then get this season and the next. The show picks back up in the 6th season and you'll possibly be disappointed where the show ends but they get a chance to tie most of the loose ends up which is nice. Anyways, the 5th season is mainly for the fan who has followed every season not the casual fan."
2,How dare they,mostly silly shows and plots. time to kill this series. how dare they make a joke out of a very strong Stephen King character. This series drifts so far away from the Johnny Smith depicted by Christopher Walken in the movie.
5,Dead Zone is anything but Dead,"Some series improve and grow. Andy Griffith did, Perry Mason did, Mash did. It takes a little time to find your stride. By Season 5 the stories are creative and the writers spend less time rehashing old storylines. We learn a little more about Johnny's lineage, and it is a well done episode. I knew that house was older than they made out."
2,40 Years And Still Missing Some Of His Best,"OK, there are a lot of movie composers that you could call the Big Leaguers. John Williams, Elmer Bernstein, and Jerry Goldsmith. I don't know who was in charge of this compilation, but I can't believe they would cull the ""essential"" music of such a gifted composer but overlook one of his most stirring and moving soundtracks. I'm talking of course about the 1970 war epic ""Patton"". To not include any of that music is just a travesty and that's why I am only giving this collection a 2 star rating."
4,Enjoy his music,I enjoy his music from the movies. Purchased the album to continue listening to the movie background music wherever I go.
4,"good, focused study","Strong concentration on the 1907 Czernovits Language Conference which assembled a large range of Yiddish writers and Jewish activists, and which proclaimed for the first time ""Yiddish is a national language of the Jewish people."""
2,doctor review,The ties are very difficult to tie the patients need to be helped. The ties are not on the side they are in the back. The old gowns with velcro are much easier.
4,"Excellent controller, but not for small hands!","First off, logitech makes great stuff. Their PC peripherals are the best in the market right now, and their xbox equipment is the same way.Pros:-Great price-Coolest looking controller out there-Excellent button placement-Joystick is amazing, very loose and smooth-Triggers have a good feel to them-Great solid feelCons-Not for people with small handsFor most people, this is an excellent controller. It's smaller than ""the duke"", but larger than the xbox controller s.Personally, I really liked the look and feel of this controller, but had to switch back to the xbox s because my hands are a bit on the smaller side and I just couldn't get used to it."
5,Excellent controller - probably the best in the market,"This control is very good. The handling feels great, very ergonomic and the buttons are placed in an excelent ditribution. The construction seems very durable, made with high quality materials. At this price I think it's worth every penny. The only ""bad"" thing is that it may be too big for small hands..."
3,Only a slight problem for FPS games...,"I was hoping for an excellenet product, and in fact this controller feels very solid and durable, and performs as well as the Controller S in every game, except....clicking the Analog Sticks down is extremely difficult when tilted, expecially the left analog stick wich doesn't even clicks down in any other position that in the center, which renders it unusable in most FPS games where it's mapped to crouching."
5,Great Controller!,"este es un control excelente, desde los puntos de vista costo,funcionalidad y calidad.Recientemente he comprado dos de estos, despues de probar con varias marcas, y puedo decir sin temor a equivocarme, que es uno de los mejores controles disponibles en el mercado para la xbox."
2,Great Idea - Need to reengineer,"I bought this toy for my lab who constantly needs to be entertained. He picked up on the concept of the toy immediately. I even Trained him to find and bring his ""treat"" toy.Unfortunately, the treats would not come out no matter how hard the toy was dropped on the floor. I tried every size treat. Grant it, a pea size morsely of a treat works, but it comes out too fast defeating the purpose of the toy. Recommend the inventor go back and revisit the treat dispensing mechinism."
3,Just not durable enough,My 8 month old labrador retriever absolutely loves this toy. He's been having a ball with it for the last two hours. Unfortunately it's already being destroyed. Our dog is an aggressive chewer and this just doesn't stand up. I'll have to go back to the Kong toys.
2,Poor Food Control Design,"The unit is shipped with little rubber-like tines that prevent treats from coming out the ends. You are supposed to trim the tines until the food comes out at the desired rate. However, the difference between the tine length that lets food out and the length that doesn't is small. When cutting it down you can easily go from no food coming out to all the food falling out too easily. Obviously, there is no way you can then increase the length of the tines. After the first few attempts at triming the tines, my dog couldn't get any of the treats out. Then after my last tine trimming attempt, he emptied it out in less than a minute."
2,Maybe good if your dog isn't a chewer,"My dog could not figure out how to get the treats out. I tried cutting the tabs shorter but he still couldn't get them out or figure out how to shake it so all he does is chew on the end. Unfortunately, not for my dog."
5,I'm the one chuckling...,"I was excited to get this for Hemingway, our husky mix, because he just LOVES treat toys. He has almost destroyed his Kong (heave duty my foot) and I can't find the right treats for his Holee ball. This seemed perfect because I could use the treats we already had and stuff them in the Chuckle toy.Hemingway would throw the toy all around the house unable to get the treat out. He would then bring it over to me to take it out for him. I love the toy BECAUSE it's hard for him to take out. This is what keeps him busy for longer than 10 minutes. I can see where it would be difficult to clean (a complaint I saw in another review) but I can probably figure out a way to get most of the grime out (either by soaking or using a small thin brush). Otherwise, I'm very happy with the toy. I love watching Hemingway toss the toy around...and the joy of him eating bits and pieces that may fall out. I can be messy this way...but worth it. I will probably get the other variety of Chuckle toys."
2,Indestructible BUT Ineffective,"My lab/shepherd mix is a voracious chewer and this ranks up with KONG and West Paw products as indestructible (+2 stars). However, this doesn't do the job I need it to, which is entertain her for hours by challenging her to figure out how to make it dispense treats (-3 stars). We've had this for three years and it absolutely never has dispensed what I've put inside, no matter how small. She doesn't get it and neither do I. We've both given up on it. You can't take it apart to clean it out, either, so you have to stick things into it to get them out. Lame. Looking for good treat toys that won't get destroyed by an active chewer? Lulu loves the JW pet amaze-a-ball, her Kong, and her Kong wobbler and they've all stood the test of time."
2,Not a favorite for my dog,"My dog likes squeak toys and likes chewing... so I was happy to find this toy which combined two favorite things. However, it has been a disappointment for me and the dog. He isn't interested in chewing on the hard rubber; he knows there are flavorful treats inside, and that's what he wants to taste. To get the treats, the dog has to grasp the rubber toy and shake... but when the food is released from the toy, he would have to put down the toy to go after the flying kibble. He hasn't been interested in all that effort!"
4,What is Social Constructionism?,"This is a great book for a number of reasons. Gergen is a great writer, historian, and activist. He takes and uses the greatest hits of postmodern thought to craft an argument for radical constructivism. Many may disagree with my comparison, because Gergen grounds his self-organization in social or interpersonal grounds, but I cannot yet see the division line. If you are interested in seeing how one bases a theory on critical theory read Gergen who gives it a go. Does he suceed? You be the judge."
5,This CD rocks so freaking hard,"Not only do these guys rock so hard, but they are cute too! The music is very inventive from a young band influenced by radiohead, jeff buckley, muse, and the like. they also have solid, pensive, yet convicting lyrics. and they rock hard."
5,Love Paddington,My daughter and I collect Paddington so it was nice to find a bear that is hard to find in the stores.
5,A True Guide to Spiritual Growth,"For those whose hearts desire a relationship with God; to know Him, to hear Him and receive from Him, this book is for you. I am blessed by the way this man carefully explains through the book, The Song of Solomon, the way we must take to come to those places of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ."
5,the secret of the stairs,awesome!!! it was actrately described sent quickly. i will be looking for this sellers items in the furture!!! i highly reccomend!!!
5,litedisc reflector,"This works fantastically. It folds into a very small case so it iseasy to carry around. I have the translucent and also the gold/silverone and find them very useful in the field (shooting wildlife, nature, etc.)Carry both in your camera bag!"
3,Informative but dull,"I am fascinated by the transformation of the Western Roman Empire into Medieval Europe and the early Christian church. That's why I expected to immensely enjoy this ambitious book. I did not. Ms. Herrin has an impressive, even intimidating grasp of a vast amount of information. Unfortunately, her presentation is dull and leaden. I could only read a few pages at a time before my eyes started involuntarily closing. I have read many authors who were able to present even relatively specialized history in a vivid exciting manner. Unfortunately, Ms. Herrin, although clearly a great scholar, is not one of them. If you read history for pleasure as I do (as opposed to using it as a resource for your own book or article) you will be disappointed and to a certain extent exasperated by this book."
4,Serious History,"This is a scholarly work about a fairly obscure subject. It isn't about the spread of religion. Instead, the book deals with the transition of the various political entities of Europe from secular states into Christian ones. It describes the increase of the power of the Church as it fills the vacuum left by the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Activities such as looking after the poor, maintaining public buildings and organizing and regulating commence became the domain of religious leaders. By undertaking these actions they gained the popular support of the people. They soon established the right of the Church to advise and even make demands upon secular leadersThis is not a casual beach book, but for those interested in European history it provides an interesting look at the transition from Roman authority to feudal suzerainty."
3,Could Hold Better,"I purchased this ball head for a mono pod. It does not hold as good as the ""SLIK Compact Ball Head"" I bought for a small tripod. The force needed to really tighten down the ball movement is excessive. I would say it takes at least twice the pressure on the turn screw then The ""SLIK"" does and probably more. I use a mono pod for fast wild animal shots and the excessive tightening is a distraction that causes me to loose shots or have the camera move on the ball if not tight enough. If I keep up with this hobby I will probably replace it in time. The two compact ball heads looked the same, and I probably thought it was the one I bought before, but the difference is night and day."
2,photoirguy,"Sunpak has a nice finish but doesn't lock well, still has some creeping movement when added pressure is applied not so with the Slik SBH-100 ball head which has a better locking lever."
4,Archaeological evidence paints the picture,"Reading accounts of the Battle of the Little Bighorn sometimes leaves a mass of confusion to the reader. Even visitation to the site does not always enable oneself to clearly picture the events of that day. This book, which does not attempt to explain why things happened does much to set the scene and completes the picture that is painted by the numerous accounts of what happened. The reader may find this book to be dry, perhaps repetitious in some place, but in the end, will appreciate the information that is provided. Be aware that reading this book will forever cause the reader to imediately reject any printed material on The Battle of the Bighorn, that is not properly (and correctly) researched. This book is a good reference for any library."
3,"Another ""what if"" Little Big Horn Book","I was looking forward to reading this book. I thought, at last a final verdict on the battle. But what I got was just another ""expert"" view of what might of happened. It is interesting & maybe an accurate account, but the author seems to have gone into the project with his preconcieved notions and went about trying to prove them. Much like Kuhlman's early work. (Which this author ripped without mercy)"
2,Hard to read,"This is a nice looking measurer, but the markings are so small and light they are just about impossible to read. I think I'm going to have to return for something with better markings.Also, it is only marked in mL and oz, no cups."
5,dirt devil filters,"I received this package faster than I expected. The value is extremely good for 4 of these. They are washable and they will last longer. thank you for the wonderful pricing, we senior citizens do appreciate that very much."
4,Dirt Devil F8 Type Filter,"Shipping was very timely. Performance fine.Reason why I'm rating it a four star is the price.It could be cheaper, in the $9.00 or $10.00 range."
5,Cheap filter! Works great!,This filter was much cheaper than buying one in the store.It works just as good as the ones in the store.
4,Very Good,Pro:Very Fast DeliveryCon:But it is not the Original Filter and after using it only once i noticed a lot less suction when using the nozzle part of my vacuum. Which is annoying because I use that fairly often.All in all..I still think it does a great job...
4,Good retail filter,My vacuum needed a new filter. I am not even sure if any of the local stores carry this particular filter. I purchased it from amazon for a decent price and it is the factory brand so it fits perfect.
2,Just right,Just what I needed to install Gas Log set to sch 40. PipeHad to get shutoff valve but no big deal
5,Tang Wipes!!!!,"Its fantastic that these are coming out. I hope season 3, 4, and 5 all come out within the next year or so. I picked this up the afternoon it came out, went home, and have been enjoying it over the past few nights. It brings back so much of what TV doesn't have today: great sitcoms that make you laugh. You didn't have to think when you watched the Bundy's, you just had to laugh. Tang Wipes, the physical humor, and how can you not laugh at Buck? The hidden easter eggs are outtakes from the reunion special, and while there are quite a few, most are just uninteresting. But the episodes are great. Especially the one where Al and Steve go looking for Marcies Barbie. Just the montage with the Glen Frey song ""you belong to the city"" is worth the whole price of the set. Go pick it up today, along with the new Tesla Cd, Into the Now!!!!"
5,Great! We want more!!!,"Well, does this show even need a review???????Stop reading now... I said NOW.. and hit the ""Add to Cart"" button or something... Didn't I tell you to stop reading???"
4,Better set than Season 1,"Not that I like this season more beacause its just as good as Season 1, but the screen quality is much better than the S1 set and it has better menu's. This set has 22 eps but the Special Features are pretty lacking, all that they had was excerpts from the Reunion Special they aired on Fox and on the S1 set in the form of Easter Eggs. If you're a Hardcore MWC fan, this should be enough for you, but some might be turned off by the lack of Special Fetures. If you're new to the show, watch the season first, or rent the DVD's from Blockbuster if they have them."
3,Wonderful scent....but doesn't last long.,"This is a great smelling perfume. I'm not usually one for flowery scents, but something about this one just appealed to me. Unfortunately, like some other reviewers have commented, the scent doesn't last very long. I spray it on in the morning before walking out the door and by the time I get to work, I swear the scent has disappeared. Granted, my commute to work is about 2 hours but, come on, that's not long enough for perfume (it's too long for a commute though!). Is asking for at least 10-12 hours asking too much? So, only 3 stars from me."
2,Disappointed,"It was the product that I ordererd, however, it was the ""Tester"" bottle. The ""Tester"" bottle, really???I was expecting a new bottle of perfume. No where in the description from the seller did it say that I would be recieving the ""tester"" bottle. The word ""tester"" was written on both bottle and the box. And, there was no cap on the valve, either. To make matters worse, I purchased this for a gift. I never did give it to the recipient. I couldn't imagine doing so.Extremely disappointed!"
4,Burberry London,"My girlfriend bought this, she had this to say:The covering of the Burberry is really nice. The scent is a classic and Burberry is a must! Any woman would appreciate it as a gift =)"
5,great scent,"this was recommended to me by a friend as a gift for my girl. she wears it all the time now, and i just cant get enough of that classy smell"
2,Great Price - Definitely Not The Best Burberry Scent,"I was very happy that I got this for a great price ($42), especially with all the hype the departmental stores created about this being the best Burberry for women. As early as the second day, I felt nauseous and the scent still gives me a feel of wearing a very strong smelling hair oil!!!! The same day, I decided to pass it on to my family and friends if by any chance they like it (:~()To me, the regular Burberry Brit and even Burberry Weekend are way better choices than this one! You get almost the same deal on those easily."
2,Not what I was expecting,"This perfume smells really good but as many others reviewers said, it does not last longer than 1H.I hate the fact that i paid $35 for one perfume that is just a Counterfeit!!!!!Don't waste your money on this One.Anyway, the perfume smells great, I will probably go to some store that sells the original Burberry London and buy one that lasts on me.I hope it helped!!! :)"
5,Love the fragrance,I was well pleased with this product. I especially was impressed with the fragrance and the cost of the product. I would definitely purchase it again.
1,Unhappy Customer,"I purchased Burberry London and never received it. I had to go and buy it from JR. a local store.Thanks, Amazon."
3,"not, what I spect","The shiping was fast, nothing to complain about the servis, just it wasn't, as good as I expect, the fragance is to sweett when you try it on, I start getting headeches, even if I use very little, to strong."
2,SURPRISED AT LACK OF QUALITY,"THIS DOESN'T SMELL NEARLY AS NICE AS THE LAST BOTTLE I BOUGHT. HAS THE QUALITY CHANGED?PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN SMELL IT ON ME, I USE TO GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS."
5,Wife Loves it,I got a smaller bottle of this for Christmas 2009. She liked it so much she asked for it again. I hadn't seen the price for this anywhere near what I got it from here for. She still likes it and I think it smells good on her.
5,the good stuff for half the price!,I was amazed and thrilled when I found my fave parfum on amazon for half the price. Hooray! Was worth the wait instead of instantly buying in the store. Fast shipping.
3,Burberry,Love this fragrance. It is easy to wear and not as heavy as the other Burberry scents. It seems lighter and younger.
2,"Not pleased, win some and lose some","I purchased this perfume cause its the only one my wife wears, When I received it the spray valve did not work, I had to rig it in order for her to use it then to our surprise it smelled of alcohol with a hint of the original scent. This Perfume must be extremely old and dated."
4,Wonderful Fragrance,Burberry London By Burberry For Women is as the title states! Very pleasant and not overpowering.
3,My 2 cents,"I recieved my product very quickly. No complaints about the service at all. The fragrance is wonderful. However, it's not long lasting at all. I spray it where I can check out the sent later and there is nothing there. If I had to pay cash I'd rather go to the mall and purchase (I've made perfume purchase before on this site with another vender and my complaint is the same,,,,fragrance don't last). Would I still purchase? As long as I recieve gift certificates I will because I love designer fragrances and would use them for purchases. I give the 3 star because the fragrance simply don't last."
3,Nice,"The table runner FINALLY arrived today, it's pretty nice, just as the photo depicts. My only small complaint is that the s&h seemed a bit high, $11.99, I ordered this item on January 4th and it just arrived today, January 19th, for $11.99 s&h you would think it would arrive in 2 to 3 business days."
3,I have used this book for College Classes.,"This book is OK. The graphics are great but the concepts are not layed out in the best possible format. Several times I got confused at what the book was saying and had to take it to my teacher. If you have a good teacher though, this is a great book."
5,"New Shoes, Red Shoes Shines!","New Shoes, Red Shoes is currently one of my almost two year old daughter's favorite books. Although the reading level is listed at 4-8, it has been the first non board book that has been concise and colorful enough to hold my toddler's attention as I read to her. I suspect it will also be a great book for her when she begins to read herself. The concept is one that is simple and familiar, and is written in language that she can easily understand, and repeat as she begins to speak. The text is accompanied by fabulous colorful pictures which are like candy for the eyes. We read it every night!"
5,Our 15 month old loves this book!,"We received this book as a gift a couple of months ago and we had no idea how entranced our daughter would be. The photos are big, bright and uncluttered. The text is simple and rhythmic. She sometimes asks us to read it to her three or more times a day. We're ready to buy a second copy, because our daughter's enthusiastic page turning has taken a toll on her copy. We highly recommend this book for children as young as 12 months old."
4,Shoes Book,"As baby gets those new crib shoes, she/he will start to observe that they come in various hues. This book helps baby to learn colors."
3,Lots and lots and lots of shoes!,"This simple story is great for toddlers. The words bounce along in a catchy ""peas-porridge-hot, peas-porridge-cold"" rhythm, and the bright colors are attractive without being retina thrashers. There's no need to wait until your child can read, or even talk. She'll love this one, if you read it enthusiastically. Heartily recommended."
4,Go for it if your not so sure !!!,"A lot of people are not decided which course they want to pursue, they are just about a better degree. This book gives a lot of flexibility for such people. Moreover, now a days, all the tests are becoming computerized, so the real-life setting from these CBTs help a lot. This is one investment, that shall not go waste."
3,Not as Good as I Thought It'd Be,"Kudos for the good advertising on Myspace, where I found their page and heard some of their better songs. Unfortunately, I thought all the songs would be good... some of the songs are butchered with what I would guess is a cheesy, accordion-like addition to some of the classics. I bought this for my son because I was tired of replaying the regular Vivaldi, Bach, Mozart, Tchaikovsky. It's a hit and miss with kids, but overall is a decent collection of remixed songs I play in the car when my son is there, but I find myself skipping tracks to the 2-3 on each CD that I happen to like more (there are 2 CDs that come with this)."
4,Copyright Issues,"Tremendous music. But the glory of the Kwai music was the counterpoint of Colonel Bogey and Arnold's March. We are told on recordings like this, that because of copyright reasons, this arrangement can only be heard in the context of the original film.What kind of obstinate dog-in-the-manger philistine situation is this? Who is responsible? The Kenneth Alford estate? Whoever owns the film rights?Colonel Bogey should go into the public domain soon, so I hope we will then be able to hear Arnold's tremendous arrangement and blending of the two marches."
5,Classic Film Scores,"Malcolm Arnold's film scores stand on a par with his concert music; they are of equally high quality. Of the five films represented on this CD, the most prominent would have to be the 1957 best picture Oscar winner, The Bridge on the River Kwai. But, having said that, it would at most have to be considered as first among equals, as the other scores represented are also well-done and well-performed. For film score buffs, this CD should be a keeper."
1,This book must have been written in a day,"The book has several typos and uses terrible examples. I did not like the flow of the book at all. Even some of the basics (like variable declarations), were not properly explained. The bottom line is that the book was obviously rushed. I wouldn't recommend this title at all."
2,"""Dummies"" are usually good, but this one...",I found it not very useful and I couldn't keep reading the book after the first 2 chapters!
1,Not OEM Quality,"I purchased two of these chargers because of the price. As soon as I plugged them into my iPhone, I received an error message that the phone was not charging. I contacted the seller and they said that because the charger is not OEM, the phone displays the message, but it will still charge. That's true; however, it charges so SLOWLY that you need to have it plugged in all day for it to charge adequately. If I wanted to be tethered to a wire, I would just use a land line..."
1,Disappointed,"Great service from the company but, very poor product. I guess the old addage, you get what you pay for, applies here. The charger worked for two cycles then stopped charging. My iphone thinks it is charging but, never gains battery power and eventually shuts off."
1,Avoid This at all cost if you want your iPod to live,"I got this charger today, and plugged my ipod (which was working just fine) into this. the screen went black and now it doesn't work at all"
2,Would not suggest this,I would not suggest purchasing this item. For whatever reason it will not stay plugged into the wall - I have to keep pushing it in to be sure it is connected. The way they made it - a small white piece sticks out so it does not fit flush to the electrical outlet. I charged my phone all night long and realized it never even charged. Plus it has a BRIGHT light that lights up your entire room while it does charge - not a good purchase at all. I got what I paid for.....
1,AWFUL,"This product does not work AT ALL! It will not charge from the wall and when it does, it messes up the phone. I had to completely discard the large white part that connects to the wall and I can only use the computer to charge my work phone. The price was small so I should have expected it."
1,Pure Garbage,if I could give it no stars I would; Almost burnt my iphone and ipod without even charging them. pure garbage bought from a seller called HandHelditems.... don't ignore the negative reviews or you risk losing your much loved apple gadgets.
2,Don't waste your $$!!,"It's a good thing I only paid $.01 for this! Even so, including shipping (which was nearly $4.00!!), this was a waste of money! I bought three, and the first one I used completely fell apart the first time I disconnected it from my iPhone! And why are iPhone chargers so SHORT??!!"
2,"Delicate, perhaps overcharges batteries","This iPod charger functioned for a while, but it is delicate. Even with very careful use, the outer cord covering detached and opened up where it entered the plug that attaches to the iPod.My iPod Nano battery seemed to loose capacity too quickly and died about the same time the charger's cord split. I did not frequently top-off the Nano's battery, but followed the recommended protocol of charging only when the battery was fairly low. Total life span of the Nano's battery was under 15 months, and it was not used heavily. I suspect, but do not know, that this rather short battery life might have something to do with a charging voltage that is a bit too high. This charger is probably best suited as a secondary charger for occasional use.I suspect that Apple chargers do a better job of maximizing the life of the very expensive iPod batteries. FYI: A famous auction site has Hong Kong suppliers selling Apple wall chargers for less than $10 delivered."
1,Don't Buy This,I plugged my Nano into this charger for about 10 minutes and picked it up to check it out - it almost burnt my hand. My Nano is now Toast! I hope it just toasted the battery and not the whole device.
1,Junk,"I purchased this charger to replace my original that came with my iPhone 3G. I had it a week, worked fine, then magically stopped working. The quality of the charger is cheap plastic. If you're looking for a charger that only lasts a week, it's a great buy. Other than that, it's a piece of crap. Don't waste your time."
2,"Works good for a while, then dies...","I liked this when I first got it... very cheap, handy to travel with or leave at work, etc. After a couple months, it died completely... the little power light wouldn't even come on. I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work."
3,Great Product - Not so great Service,"This charger works great. However, I ordered two chargers on 12/4 and received only one in the mail with no indication as to why only 1 was sent (invoice confirmed 2 were ordered). Phone calls to this company were futile as no one would answer and the answering machine was full. Company responded to second e-mail attempt and indicated second charger would ship mid-Dec. Finally received 2nd charger on 12/27, two days after Christmas."
1,price too good to be true,Good thing I did'nt spend alot of money on this product. It is not compatable with my son's 8gb 4th gen ipod nano. The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.
5,Alpen Zoom Binocular,"Bought Alpen because of past reviews. Did not regret listening to other customers.I use them for football games. They perform as stated. Excellent optics and the zoom works great.At 21 power the field of view is reduced, that is expected. You can hand hold at 21 power if you are steady. Most of my viewing is from 7-10. I only use the higher power for checking on a given situation, then back to lower power. It is nice to have that capability. And by the way, I wear glasses and they work fine.I would recommend these for any viewing use."
4,Not for Those With Glasses,"I saw these at a home show. The one's I used there are eactly like these but you could turn each eye cup left or right depending if you wear glasses or not. I thought I purchased the same but the eye cups turn down for wearing glasses and it does not help.Otherwise these are very nice, clear, easly to use. I will be using them a lot on some trips."
1,Not a good book,"This might be the most self-absorbed, self-aggrandizing, hypocritical book I've ever read. For one, the book is 109 pages with 16 full pages of pictures for a price of $15. Second, the man acts as if taking care of your family is the most important thing in the world, yet he abused his wife, he wouldn't get a job to take care of their bills, he specifically talks about how to ""manipulate the system"", by using students loans to purchase a Land Cruiser, jewelry, and electronics. Finally, his boasting takes on a ridiculous level when he talks of being one second off the World Record time as a freshman in high school in the 400. Oh, did I mention R.Kelly was watching from the stands! I believe that DCFS is a flawed system, but does the best it can with what it's given. I just hope that this system does not continue to produce people of this character. Buy the book at your own risk."
2,Doesn't really work,This product didn't perform the way it was advertised. I have been working with it and following the instructions carefully. Do it three times per week and still waiting for results. I wouldn't waste the money.
2,I was looking for TI-89 help not Calculus help.,"This is a great book if your looking for help in calculus and have a TI-89. If you are looking for a book that will simplify your TI-89 from that nightmarish tech manual it comes with, this is not it. This book teaches you how to do calculus, but not how to do it on your calculator."
1,very disappointing,"I bought this calculator for my 16 year old son who is taking calculus and physics in high school this year.He has had nothing but problems with it,even though I bought the handbook for it too.Currently,it is frozen.It will not perform any function at all,and he can't even shut it off without taking out the batteries.He had good luck with a TI-81 that I purchased for him on Amazon,but the TI-89 has been very disappointing."
3,Careful about measurements,"It did not fit my door. Nowhere did it mention the distance from hole to whole, and I thought it was standard. But no. I've bought other reinforcing hardware and it all fits except this piece. So I know my door and door jamb is standards, it's the piece that doesn't fit."
5,a good stove companion!,This item fit my oil bottle perfectly and pours perfect for my tastes. I leave it by the stove for convenience but not too close to the heat. Heat isn't good for good oil.It is a slow pourer which I happen to like. I use it for my olive oil and wine. They don't leak and are well priced. It beats pouring from larger containers when I am cooking. I would definitely recommend
4,"Lots of fun, and good quality DVD","The reviewers are right-- Juan and Diana are a kick to watch. I've never met them (no, I'm not a groupie), but seeing them in action makes one wish one could be in New York checking out their dance troupe. So much energy! The steps are explained clearly with memorable (if non-standard) names, and the DVD is of good quality. For a beginning salsa dancer, I would recommend this DVD, the steps are explained extraordinarily well and there's everything one one tape to make a guy (or gal) feel amply ready for the clubs. This video's timing is ""on one"" rather than New York-style ""on two"" timing, despite the ""New York Salsa"" name (so it's appropriate for those in other parts of the country as well). Recommended."
5,Excellent to begin with,"I and my partner, after a taking couple salsa lessons, decided to improve our practice with videos. I think this one was a very good choice for what we aimed to do. Compared to most other instuctional videos, Juan and Diana use the time very efficiently. They first teach the basic movements and terminology then proceed with partner work and end up with 15 different figures in 52 minutes."
2,Not a Good Deal!,This DVD cost a lot and you get so little. I was not pleased with the quality. I could buy 2 other DVDs for the price of this one.
1,Poor quality DVD,The DVD skips so often with loud noise between the cuts. You can't see all the steps and moves.
1,don't buy this cd,"new york salsa is title -- teaching on one, real new york salsatheir dancing is atrocious, you will pick up many horrible fundamental dance habits you will have to unlearn later. this dvd is dangerous for a dancer to buy. starting with the cbl, male's huge back step on 5.don't buy this dvd and if you have it, throw it in the trash."
1,beginner salsa,Please don't purchase any dvd from this comapny cal bookmiest or you will be sorry you did.
1,Poor Quality.,This DVD was of poor quality when you consider how much it costs. I found other DVDs that were more professionally done and really helped me to learn how to dance salsa.
1,watch youtube instead!,"I read the reviews and decided to buy. This product was for people who have never seen a salsa move in their lives. There was hardly any music backround, which i find helps to learn steps. The DVD is just a variety of steps, shown once or twice and then they move on. It was poorly done, and memorizing all the steps they showed, is imposssible with the combinations (like 3 steps in 3 different combos) that they show in the end. This was a very poor buy, I know basic salsa, and I was very disappointed with this tape. I learned nothing, and I have learned more from watching free videos on youtube. Hence my review: Watch youtube!"
2,Amateurish,Amateurish video. There are many that are more well made and really teach you the fundamentals for Salsa dance.
5,A real page-turner,I read the book in a day and a half... could not put it down. An amazing adventure that puts you right there with Owen as he experiences a myriad of unusual and exciting situations in far flung parts of the world with only his wits to rely on. I highly recommend this book and look forward to the next one.
5,An Engrossing Tale,"A thrilling, fascinating story with wonderful detail and personality. We are deeply drawn into identification with the central character during his lonely odyssey. I cannot imagine how anyone could read this novel without being quite emotionally affected. In fact, the book was so absorbing that I read it straight through, with barely a stop for sleep.A brilliantly written book, which I highly recommend!Maria Murphy, Sweden"
4,Way above average for a chick band,"To my surprise, this CD had very catchy lyrics with non-corporate music content. Rose Colored Glasses cleverly written with a great mix of lyrical genius and musical content. Also the song Ruby makes you really think about situations in life and how your smallest actions can turn someones life upsidedown."
3,no one mentioned the Indians!,"If you like this disc, well, this was her first and only solo record after the Indians broke up. You can buy that disc for a dollar here at Amazon. Highly recommended. The Indians - Indianism."
5,Rules were meant to be broken !,"Even though some of the reviews here are totally negative, I still think this is an excellent read. It is a wild romp through the wild side of crime and the U.S. Marshals Service. As far as Pascucci telling the truth, who the hell cares. My mother always said, ""Believe none that you hear, half what you read, and all that you see."" so if at least half of this book is true, it is worth it and Pascucci has evey right to brag (which he does) about the things he has done. It also shows that sometimes you have to ""break the rules"" in order to get the bad guys. Well I can say one thing, if this book is acurate then the bad guys have the break since Pascucci is no longer with the Marshals"
1,"Pascucci's picture is beside ""egomaniac"" in the dictionary","Pascucci was a pompous egomaniac who lived in a fantasy world. He was summarily fired from the Marshals Service after being convicted of using the U.S. mails to try to extort money from a married businessman he had videotaped having sex with his (Pascucci's) girlfriend. He served time in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and is now a convicted felon. That he attained such postion within the Service remains an embarrassment to Deputy U.S. Marshals everywhere.His book is his own weird view of his significance to the cases he discusses, and much of it is unabashed lies. I urge readers to pass on this one, not just because it's a load of crap, but because I hate to see someone like Pascucci benefit from other people's gullibility."
3,Oscar's Grouchy Sounds,"ISBN 0307123197 - Standard sturdy board book pages and standard Sesame Street quality illustrations don't quite overcome the average-ness of the book.Oscar, in rhyme, tells all about the noises he likes - from off-key marching bands to the sounds of collecting the trash. All of the sounds are loud, of course!Just kind of nothing here. Not terrible, and Sesame Street fans will find more in it to love than I did, but it's just too standard all around for me.- AnnaLovesBooks"
4,"oscar rhymes (raps?) about ""noises grouches like""","A board book with simple cartoons of basic events -- ""trays crashing, drinks spilling"" etc. Might prompt young listener to imitate noises and activities described -- or if your child is quieter, he might like analyzing the details in the pictures. It's mainly about activity, not words."
2,NOT Bonus-sized,"Oops. The pictured product is bonus-sized, the product received is not. Also, my cories appear to be completely nonplussed about this food. And it smells bad. And my tank started clouding up the day after I started using it. This has been an unusually negative fish-food-buying experience."
3,Ok book,"I have just moved to Colombia and was really looking for something that would give me ,ore ideas of what to do around Bogota and surroundings as domestic flights are expensive for the whole family. Wish someone would write a book about more local travel within driving distance of Bogota.I actually meant to buy the new Viva guide but somehow got them mixed up. It adds a few different things to the Lonely planet book and the Bradt guide, but they're all same same really. I don't like the small format, but if you're backpacking it may be an advantage. Info and numbers appear accurate."
2,Uninspired,"This is the most unenthusiastic guide book I've ever read.This is how it reads: If you are in city A, you have the option to go to see X, Y and Z. This is what you will see at X... This is what you will see at Y... This is what you will see at Z...The least they could have done is throw in some pictures to accompany their lackluster descriptions, but they don't. This book might help you if you already have an itinerary planned out and you want to look for specifics of how to get around or where to eat, shop or stay. If you're looking for a book to recommend where you should go, what you should see and do, and how to decide between the options given a limited amount of time, this is not the book for you."
1,Title Mistake,"This is NOT a 120 volt solar panel but a 12.0 volt panel, which will NOT charge a 12.0 volt battery (need 14.5 volts minimum to charge a 12vdc battery). Basically, well, it's pretty useless. at 6W / 12V it produces 1/2 amp of current which would take 230 hours of sunlight to charge a 115 Amp Hour deep cycle battery. At best, this *could* be used to keep your car's battery alive in long term parking at the airport with all the computer drain but even there a 1 AMP panel (12-15 watts) would be more ideal given the few hours of light during the winter and shielding from the glass windshield."
5,This works great for me,"In all fairness, I never expected to charge a dead battery with this. I leave my boat parked in the desert and I leave this plugged in. Week after week, I go back to the boat and it the battery is fully charged. I was worried that without a trickle charger that I would be ""stuck"" constantly looking for a jump or have to carry another jumper battery. With the SE-400, this has not been the case. I did buy the small charge controller (probably not needed) as well as the mounting equipment. The mounting arrangement was overpriced for what it was, but it works very well and is probably the simplest way to go. If you're handy, you could easily make your own. (This should be a separate review.) If you are looking for a trickle charger, I think this is an excellent solution."
4,Well made charger,"Well made and does the job just fine. It will work on almost any 12v battery. Naturally it does not replace what an electric battery charger can do and in the same amount of time, but as a trickle charger for car and boat batteries this is all you need (other than some sunshine). The only negative is that tese Sunsei solar panels are far more expensive than they need to be. They are made in China and a 6w panel of this quality should be 30-50% less than what the Sunsei brand demands. Coleman is pretty much the same product, all coming from ICP Solar in Canada, however the Coleman panels cost much less."
3,Hard to use,It sounds like a good idea to have metal ducting all the way to your machine but I found that its hard to setup and becomes a nightmare if you ever want to move the machine a little. I do now use the hose adapter instead and add a small fexible pipe to the machine. For those that still want all metal this does the trick
5,Vanitas,"I feel Vanitas deserves every star. A chilling horror story, it keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat with amazing suspense. It's like you are standing there next to Timmy Valentine, Angel Todd, or Lady Chit. A book of passion, hatred, revenge... and a lust for mortal blood. Although it is a wonderful book, Vanitas should only be read by adults or extremely mature teens. Perfect if you want a scary story for bed reading."
3,Books,"I order books through Amazon for my son who is prison. I so far have been very happy w/ my purchaces. He always recieves them in a good timely manner, and the used books are in awesome condition."
1,ew ew ew,"I think this book is too graphic. If you love bloody, gory, just plain sick books be my guest to read this. I would have given it a 1/2 star for tryng but that is no possible."
2,low value,"I borrowed this book from a library during graduate school and found it to be very helpful in reviewing plant biochemistry. It is well written and has a fair amount of detail. The illustrations were well done and helpful. In spite of all the book has going for it however, it is outrageously expensive. In fairness, it is a fat book at nearly 1400 pages. Nevertheless the content does not justify the extremely high price tag, and I am disappointed that the publishers expect students to cough up this amount of money for a single text."
2,I don't know...,This is not Mulgrew at his best. His previous release on the MaxJazz label was better. Maybe because of the tune selection. Concerning the Live at Yoshi Cd the arrangements were so so and that Bass player was rubbish. The format was the same for all the tracks. No solo mulgrew just solo intro. then bass and drums. Mulgrew is still the one though. I would like to hear an all solo mulgrew album.
2,Listen to the fat bass,"Everything else in this produc is fine expect the subwoofer. Well it really has a fat sound, in matter of fact it is too loud and the annoying thing is that you cannot even turn it off. Even on the lowest bass settings it keeps annoying rumble and will annoy the hell out of your down stair neighbours... If you love fat bass and concert house reverb this is for you but otherwise get anoyher one!"
4,Decent for the price,"I picked these up for about $20, and they're very much worth that (and maybe a bit more). The bass is nice and deep, but the mids are thin and the highs could be a bit clearer. If you're broke and are using these for gaming or MP3's, they'd be pretty good so long as you're not too picky with sound. They cost a bit more, but the Logitech Z-3 series gets much fuller sound."
3,Live Powerpop,This CD deserves a wider release. It is currently only available on import from Japan. Before a dedicated audience in a small club The Rubes run through numbers from their Crimes against Music album and earlier Beserkley albums. Top powerpop played with fire and skill. A+
3,. . . AND OTHER STORIES,"Although I have always loved Moorcock's work, and these are fine stories, I believe that a buyer's warning should be attached. The only Aubec story is one that was already in a previous Elric book,and is about 12 pages long, and the rest of the volume is filled with other old short stories. All good, but nothing new, as I was hoping when I bought the book."
3,fish can not finish,"I dropped in my fishtank. all of them go down to graveland fish can not catch completely. If it is lotting, it is better."
1,Sinks immediately,Others have said these float but for me they are immediately reaching the bottom of the tank and staying there. Uneaten.
2,Only for specific fish,"My assorted tropical fish don't seem to like the granules all that much, so I won't purchase such a thing, again."
5,some sinks some floats,Adds wonderful color to my Geophagus Tapajos and plecos love it too. Great food for bottom feeders and smaller fish can even mortar and feed to baby fry
5,Tetra color,"Execelent product, super complete food for discus fish. It arrived very wel packed in time. I'll certainly buy tetra color granules again for may discus fish."
2,"nicely packaged, but.....","Bought this on sale in a (Target) store. I would have been more disappointed had I paid full price. The knife blade and the scissors were very dull. The knife blade appears to be too soft to be used as a cutting tool. It won't hold an edge. The mis-alignment of the scissor blades prevents them from making a clean cut. The flashlight that came with it had switch problems out of the box and spontaneously came open (unscrewed) in my pocket. <br /><br /><br />The Phillips screwdriver is very good and the pliers are fair. I bought this to replace a small Swiss Army knife that I lost. I'm going to get another. The $10 Swiss Army knife (Victorinox) does fewer things, but the blade and the scissors hold an edge and cut very well. It has a toothpick too."
4,Good but difficult to paste on PDA,"The first time I try to use it, I failed as I paste with wrong position. Then I took it off and tried to paste it again.But unfortunately, I found that it is impossible to do it twice. Because the overlay sticked on the screen tightly and the overlay has been bended after I took it off sucessfully.So I took another new overlay and try again. This time I paste it on very carefully. After I pasted it on, it is very good. The screen is sharp and writing on the screen is smooth too.There were two very small bubbles between the overlay and screen(I don't want to waste an overlay again), but after one day, the bubbles disappeared!This product is good but don't think you can wash it and use it again."
4,GREAT PAPER CUTTER!,i am so happy with my new paper cutter. it is so light. i can move from one place to another without fear of injuring myself. so easy to use. very convenient.
1,Amateur Hour Extreme,"This is perhaps the most amateurish movie I've ever seen. It's so ridiculously bad, that I had a hard time believing it was released on DVD. Horrible sound, bad acting, stupid story lines.......no redeeming fun at all. As far as being a kids film....it's too lame for that. Stupidity does not mean kids will like it. Stay away!"
5,Rockin' Ninjas!!!!,"Dave Eddy has crafted one of the most intense ninja movies I have ever seen. The fight scenes were brutal and realistic, to the point where I almost shut it off so I wouldn't get nightmares, just too much gore. Other than that it was a fine film with AWESOME editing, great directing and spectacular acting (especially the hot austrailian teacher and Big Jaw) as far as the fight choreography goes, p*** off Jackie Chan, Dave Eddy is the new king! The movie is practically flawless, I dare you to find a continuity error. The fight scene involving the balloons was highly clever, inventine and INTENSE!!!! If you haven't seen what's quite possibly the best movie with ninja in its title (sorry American Ninja) then you must buy it now. Not for the squeemish or unintelligent.Treat yourself to the best action film since Last Action Hero and buy Pocket Ninjas now!"
2,Martials arts cult film not to be missed.,"When I visited the set of this production way back in 1993, it was entitled SKATE DRAGONS and was being photographed and directed by Donald G. Jackson (RETURN TO FROGTOWN, ROLLER BLADE WARRIORS). Looks like another director took over mid-way,but the visuals directed by Jackson are his cool style. He even left them with Robert Z'Dar who's appeared in many of Jackson's new movies. Check this out to see what might have been. -Writing from the CyberPhrog Cafe in North Hollywood, OneShotSam"
4,Good for it's price.,"Not a bad product for it's price. Only bad part is setting up the speakers. Can be a bid difficult. But once you read the manual 1-2 times, It can easilly be set up."
1,Great idea that does not work,"I bought this for my grandson who wants to become involved in robotics at 12 years old. He put it together, but the plastic gears failed to work--they jammed, they skipped, they only worked intermittently. The quality simply was lousy."
1,Not for tweens,"I am a Girl Scout leader with a now 11-year-old daughter. When the annual magazine sale came around last year, GL was listed as ""the only magazine for Girl Scouts"", ages 10-15. When the first issue arrived, I flipped through it and was very disappointed with what I saw. Articles & letters about teen pregnancy, being sexually active, Dad/Mom is having an affair--the list goes on. If it was just one article I would have ripped the pages out, but that wasn't the case. My opinion is that this magazine is completely inappropriate for any pre-teen, and depending on your own daughter, 14 or 15 may still be the wrong age group. I recommend getting an issue from the library first and doing your own review -- wish I had done so and saved some money."
1,Definitely NOT for pre-teens!,"Makeup, skimpy clothes, articles about boys, kissing, and cutting? As man others have said, this is NOT a magazine for pre-teens!I would have no problems with this magazine if they advertised themselves ONLY for teens, but I am BEYOND pissed that they advertise that they are ""age appropriate"" for ages TEN AND UP!"
2,I Don't Think So,"I'm only giving GL two stars because I used to like it. Sort of. But it was really superficial. I never really loved an issue, I just searched for some articles that were okay. The real turning point was when it changed its look. Instead of Girl's Life, it was GL. Okay, I thought, this could be cool. I soon thought again. The editor's note is usually funny and nice, but this time, she was saying how all other magazines are bad, and that they are the only ones who care about you. Whatever! They dissed other magazines that I like, and their new look was all about looking like all the other magazines. I cancelled my subscription, and I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,Not As Advertised!,"This magazine is advertised as targeting 'tween' girls, but as others have mentioned here I think it is totally inappropriate. I am the father of a 10 year old girl and thought she would enjoy getting a magazine in the mail. Imagine my surprise when the first issue arrived and I saw the cover stories on kissing and how to flirt. Call me old fashioned, but this magazine is not for my daughter."
1,Inappropriate for 10 year olds!!,This magazine should change the ages to at least over the age of 13!! Young girls get thrown info on obsessing over boys at way too young an age!!
1,Inappropriate for girls in middle school,"My 6th grade daughter subscribed to this magazine through a school fundraiser. This magazine was suggested as appropriate for girls aged 10 and up. The first article that my daughter read to me had information about teenage pregnancy, abortions, and the pill. And it was inferred that this is acceptable behavior. It is not acceptable behavior in my opinion. I cancelled the magazine subscription and I plan to contact the editor of this magazine. I do not recommend this for a middle school daughter. I suggest you read a few articles before considering to get this magazine."
4,This magizine is great for girls to get ready for life,This magizines knows every thing about girls it's the perfect magizine to help girls with their problems I get a new issue every month and I can't stop reading it I never get bored I read it over and over again.
4,Good Choice,My 12 year old daughter really enjoys this magazine and the articles in it. It inspires her to take better care of herself and make better choices.
1,so sad,"As a young woman in my twenties, I remember reading magazines like American Girl and Girls Life for the activities, quizzes and fun articles. This magazine has gone WAY down hill. instead of encouraging girls to develop character, and to enjoy being a girl, this magazine pressures girls to grow up WAY TOO FAST, and to develop all the wrong character traits as a young woman- fashion obsessed, gossipy and boy-crazy. Whatever happened to encouraging honesty, respect and independence in an age appropriate way?"
2,more like under 10,"ok, i read this magazine when i was 8. its definately NOT for anyone over 12 (and that wuld have to be a very immature 12 year old) this magazine doesnt take anything seriously- its all jumpy and sweet. and anyone whos concerned about ther 10 year old daughter reading this, trust me, its better that they learn about sex from this dumb magazine than the kids at school. the only time i ever boght it over the age of 8 was at an airport where i was bored out of my mind. so basicallly, this magazine sucks, but if your on a 10 hour flight with nothing to do, itll pass the time."
2,..........,"this is s[o weak]! i mean itz okay, if your like 7 but, they advertize it for 11-15 yr. olds and only goodytwoshoes' type grlz would agree. its [junk]. its for grlz who wish they were 10 years older. please don't buy this UNLESS ur imature or 7 yrs. old. but, stick to YM, teenvogue, etc. but dont waste ur time on this mag!"
2,er...,"Three bad things:1. It focuses too much on boys, making some girls feel bad for being single.2. No one would wear the fashion; it's expensive and the outfit combos are ridiculous.3. It's pretty one-sided about things like hair removal.But GL does try its best, despite its flaws, to promote a message of self-esteem and female empowerment. It isn't superlative, but worth a shot."
1,Content totally inappropriate for age range,"This magazine was advertised as targeted toward 10-15 year old girls. I canceled our subscription early due to the content I found objectionable. In the advice column, Dr. Carol dealt with a girl who had ""gone too far"" with her boyfriend (and it was a little too explicitly written) and now she feared pregnancy. Not only do I find this type of content inappropriate for this age group, the advice was very disappointing as well. Not only did ""Carol"" advise the girl to contact Planned Parenthood, but she never even mentioned talking with her parent."
1,Bad magazine!,"This magazine talks about boys and other teen stuff. I was reading the magazine and it was talking about inappropriate stuff, I was surpised! How could a ten or eleven year old girl read about boys and kissing(how to kiss) or other inappropriate stuff. Parents if your looking for a for a magazine for your daughter that doesn't talk alot about boys, kissing and other teen stuff, DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE!!!! I recommend buying American girl magazine instead! This is mostly a preteen magazine! The ages are 10-13."
1,Don't make a mistake!,"Unless you want your daughter to learn about ""how to look hot on a date"", ""breaking up with a boyfriend"", etc., do not order this magazine for a girl under the age of 16. Promoting the show ""Pretty Little Liars"" is not my ideal of helping young, impressionable girls to be true to themselves."
5,IT'S SO AWESOME,"THIS MAGAZINE IS FUN,COOL,AND HELPS YOU WITH PROBLEMS.THIS IS GREAT FOR10-15 YEAR OLD KIDS.THIS MAGAZINE IS AWESOME!!!!!!"
1,age inappropriate,"The target audience for this magazine is way off base. On the Girl's Life Magazine website, they tout this magazine as for 10-15 year olds. My daughter received this magazine as a Christmas gift. When she received her first issue (Feb/March)I was appalled at the content. The Dear Carol feature had a girl ""writing in"" about having unprotected sex. Another girl ""wrote"" in about a guy friend that wants to be friends with benefits. Maybe I'm naive, but I'd like to think that this is not material for the majority of 10-14 year olds. Please seriously review the content of this magazine before purchasing."
1,Totally Inappropriate - should have zero stars!,This magazine is NOT appropriate for tween girls! My mother bought a subscription for my 12 year old and thankfully held on to it for us to review before giving it to her. One one of the columns where people write in it talked about a 16-year old having and abortion! NOT FOR 12 YEAR OLDS!!! It's unfortunate too because the Boys Life magazine which is published by the same company is actually very good for young boys...
2,not diverse,"I've noticed that this magazine is only featuring skinny white girls on their cover. Only once I've seen a African American teen on their cover. The note from the editor continously says that GL is designed for ""real girls""! Real girls are all different colors and sizes.They also should tone done on the make up and boyfriend talk!"
1,definitely not for a ten year old.,"Thia only encourages the behavior many 14 yr old wants to exhibit, but doesn't lend a lot to the air of caution. No to teach what will come naturally when maturity levels are ready for it."
4,Girl's Life Magazine,"I love Girls Life magazine because there are so many helpful coulmums & articles. There is 1 artical which is an advice coulmum where girls can send in a question, & Carol will respond to your questions and put them in the magazines."
4,good,i thought it was a little tacky for my age groop (11) i'm not a tacky person but some things i thought were a little inappropiate. i also thought it was good because it covered real issues not what j lo is wearing to the new movie screening or whatever. i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys like girl stuff and hearing about boyz and stuff but if your a tomboy this isn't for you.
2,WAS good,"First, I want to mention that I DID like the December-Januaray 2003 (Chrsitmas) issue of Girls Life, because it was focused on gifts to make or buy for friends, plus there was an article on ways to be a better friend. True, some parts of the article could've been done without, but in general, it was a well thought out article worth reading. After that issue, however, Girls Life went downhill from being focused on friendship to being boy, fashion, and beauty oriented. In short, if you are a girl who is interested in world issues and how to get involved, or if you are a girl who is interested in athletics, Girls Life is NOT the magazine for you!"
3,For the Girly Girl Only,"I subscribed to this magazine because it looked good-it had won the Parent's Choice Award, and it was ages 10-15. I've only gotten about 3 issues of it, and I don't like it. Most of the articles about crushes and fashion and dating, and the magazine usually displays parents (or should I say the ""rents"") as bad guys! Some parts are good, like GL Fun and Short Stuff. But I'd have to say that this magazine doesn't talk too much about sports and crafts and other stuff that girls like. If you're a girly kind of girl that's obsessed with boys and fashion, then you'll LOVE Girl's Life. Otherwise, skip it."
1,change the age range for this magazine !!!!,"I was looking for a magazine for my niece who is 11...I have boys...so this was fun and difficult at the same time...I was reading the articles...some are great and appropriate for ages 14,15 ....but for 10 , 11, even 12...I personally would say absolutely not....I am all for the latest fashion...which they do have in the magazine and for ""girl talk"" ..but when I read some of these things, all I could think is ...these girls are focusing too much on boys, boobs, and kissing for 10 and 11 year olds...does her mom want this? Is this what all the girls this age are focusing on? their articles on celebs was good..but not enough substance for me to say this is a good buy...****they should change the age range for this magazine*****...I am so far from being prude...but this is overboard for GIRLS...but ok for young ladies !!!"
4,Everything a 12 year old and up needs!!!,"I'm 12 years old and I think this magazine is awesome! I gives advice for hard times, and it shows a great way how to take care of yourself (such as your hair, face, makeup, fashion and attitude)! It gives you great, embarassing, tragic, and funny real life girl stories. The only thing I did not exactly like was all the things about guys. I have absolutely no problem with a few tips on how to pick the right guy or anything like that, it's just that almost every page you turn, there is something on how to get guys. Besides that, I think this magazine is great for anyone 12 or older."
2,times are a changin',"Thinking back i only have fond memories of when i spent my summers laying on the lawn in my backyard reading this magazine when i was 11-12. I'm 21 now and one night when i had to baby sit my 10 yr old cousin she had this magazine. I hadn't read a girls life mag since i was 13, so i flipped through it and was surprised at the change in content. Instead of having real girls on the cover its all these prettied up disney stars, and about how to look hot at a party, how to get a boyfriend , etc. What happened the days when it was about the top ten movies for a sleepover, or how to have a fun filled summer, or reviews on the latest toys, hair and beauty products, books or gadgets. I'm sure they still have some that, and even though I can't put all the blame on the mag, they could just be reflecting and following the changing times. But still..."
3,Another great mag to check out...,"Another great magazine to check out, for girls 8 & up, is Discovery Girls. It has tons of great age-appropriate advice/articles on family, friends, sports, & school. Parents: check out Discovery Girls before buying it for your younger daughter to make sure the contents go along with your beliefs (especially about makeup & fashion). My mom thinks it's a great magazine for me!"
1,Not the magazine 11-13 year olds,"Girls Life is a great magazine for girls 14+. It has talk about emotions, friends, and has great advice. The worst is that it talks too much about boys. Sometimes it gets so way into it that I've seen some issues with headlines like, "" Be an AMAZING kisser!""I'm 11 years old and in the age they say is for the magazine and oh my gosh, I do not have a boyfriend, I've never kissed a boy, or had a major flirting session. The other thing is fashion. Some of their fashion is good, but can be two dramatic such as wearing a super short short that practically looks like a bikini bottom and they say it is the look to wear that short with neon tights under it! If anybody wore that to school, they will be laughed at. The other thing is that everything they feature in the magazine is body-bearing!In the swimsuit's section in one issue, they only showed bikinis that all were expensive! One word for this magazine: Yuck1"
1,found a appropriat Mag for 10-12,"Try Discovery Girls.....more appropriate for younger girls. Girls on cover are same age group.Not celebs,etc.... Reg everyday girls."
1,Really???,"My wife ordered this subscription for my 13-year old thinking that it would be a little more tame than Seventeen. Boy, were we wrong!!! This magazine is full of obsessing on guys and (...crushes on girls), very little on fashion, and friendship. This magazine is targeted for teens that have no home life and are seeking their identity through who they've kissed and how popular they are. We're canceling!!!"
2,NOT for American Girl magazine lovers,GL is in the children's room at our public library which goes through the 6th grade level. The articles on kissing and boys are not appropriate for at the very least ages 7-10. The girls are showing lots of skin in popular styles which more conservative families would avoid. Not good role models that way. Just another way to sexualize our kids.shar
2,WHAT HAS GONE WRONG????,"When I was in 6th grade, this magazine was excellent. It had all I wanted to know about boys, party stuff, friends, cooking, etc. But now that I am 13, I wanted to subscribe but I have heard all of this crap about fashion. What has happened to the GIRL""S LIFE I USED TO KNOW?? AND WHY IS IT CALLED GL??? Everyone should write an email to them telling them to change. That's what I did. And give them some ideas why, be persuasive, not forceful."
1,Age Inappropriate!,"I would have given it zero stars if I could.My daughter (11) was flipping through this magazine and I decided to see what it was about. WoW, I thought I was reading a young adult magazine. Publishers ""Girls Life Acquisition Corporation"" if your reading this not all parents are to busy to ignore what their kids are doing. If this is the type of trash you let your young daughters read you need to work on your parenting skills. My daugther has been raised properly and does not need the degenerate morals of todays current entertainment/society snuck in on her by a magazine that says its for ages 10+. Sure there a many many parents out there who don't parent anymore but I'm not one of them. Your trash is no longer welcome in our house."
2,Not for young girls,"I subscribed to this magazine, sight unseen, for my daughter who will be ten soon, thinking it would be a safe alternative to the teen magazines. Big mistake! I thought it was aimed at the ""Tween"" crowd. But with the advice column letter from a girl asking whether she should lose her virginity to her boyfriend before her family moves away I see I was very wrong. The editors need to figure out once and for all who their target market is. All of the articles on boys are way too much for 4th and 5th graders, and from the comments I have seen from older girls, they think the magazine is lame and for younger girls."
2,Too Mature!,"I agree with other writers. I was looking for a magazine for my 11 yr. old daughter--I though she'd ""outgrown"" American Girl. This isn't the answer! Very heavy on boy/girl issues--I also found most of the ads were inappropriate--heavy makeup, sexy clothing. I'd say this magazine is better suited to 13 to 14 year olds. As for our family, we'll stay with American Girl for the next couple of years!"
1,GL not for girls,"If your daughter is younger that 14 or 15 do not get this magazine. The articles are not meant for girls but for young women. Also, the clothes shown in ads and articles would be offensive on a 10 year old. If you want a magazine for your preteen daughter try American Girl instead."
3,1/2 and1/2,"This magazine was ok. Some articles are good,but you dont get much out of it. My advice is to get one from a store and if you like it, subscribe to it on Amazon!"
5,GL magazine rating,"I love this magazine, and I recommend it to all girls age 9-14. It's an awseome read!"
2,Eh...,"Cutesy, fluffy, but of no use to girls who actually have problems in life. When girls are at the crucial age of 11, 12, or so, and when they are just starting to discover their interests in boys, when they are just beginning their journeys towards womanhood, it is no time for them to be bombarded with information on how to kiss a boy. That comes much later.Girls who act so mature, kissing and dating boys when they are so young, are doomed to a life of divorce and unhappiness. THey will think that every cute guy who comes along actually cares about them. Girls that age have more important things to worry about than catching a cute guy. I am very disappointed...I thought this magazine would deal with issues such as grades, building better relationships with your parents, dealing with your raging emotions. But GL is all about cute styles, bikini-worthy bodies, little blonde girls, and boys. Yuck.That said, it does have some cute quizzes. But again, totally useless entertainment."
1,Less than one (1) star! Awful Magazine for the recommended ages!,"As a parent of a ten year old girl, I feel this magazine is inappropriate in that the first and LAST issue we will ever purchase discusses kissing boys and suicide and self injury. While the subject of teen suicide and self injury is not one to be ignored, it is not appropriate for a ten year old nor is the issue of kissing boys, in my opinion. We will not be purchasing this magazine again nor recommending to anyone else."
2,Gone Downhill,"I got this magazine for 4 years. I agree with others reviewers when I say that with every issue this magazine just goes downhill. I stopped my subscription last year. Instead of encouraging girls to be themselves, this magazine added more and more things to the contrary. Why do you need celebrities on the cover? And and article on how to kiss? Don't waste your money on this magazine."
1,too much information for a 9 to 12 year old!,This magazine is is too old for my nine year old. One of the articles discuss Breast enhancing cream. I do not want my daughter obsessing about her breast size at this age. Theres too much pressure on young girls as it is about how they look. It should be talking about who they are on the inside not how big their boobs are and if they need enhancing cream. What are you thinking!
1,poor moral/ethics with this mag!,"A relative ordered this mag for our 10 year old daughter. There was no way I was letting her have this magazine. It is about dating, big nite looks for under $35, and flawless skin. Really? For a 10-15 yr old? The advertising in the magazine is horrible as well, PUMA ad with some female soccer person COVERED in tattoos! UGLY! And not what I want my kid thinking is ok or appropriate."
1,White? Skinny? Puh-leez!!,"If it wasn't bad enough that the media says that all girls should be skinny and white, why did you guys start? A few years ago my daughter got her first GL mag, it had a very pretty colored girl on the front, and she was very pleased. Lately you guys have acted that we were colored like dirt for a reason! My daughter told me about those girls that spoke up, that actually got in the magazine, I felt sorry for a moment but then I realized that they had a good point! This magazine is great and both my daughter and I enjoy it, but folks, I wouldn't subscribe for a few months - at least until these letters get to them and they do something about it."
3,"uhhh..okay, I guess","First, I have to say that I don't think GL is 10-15 years old-appropriate. They have too much of a focus on guys and dating and relationships and all that stuff. I mean, I'm 14 and I've never even been kissed. On the positive side, it has cool stuff about clothes and make-up and celebs. Order this for a 13-16 year old girl."
5,Best Teen Girl Magazine Out There,"I picked up this magazine at the airport just so I could read something while I was waiting. But I couldn't put it down. Unlike ComsoGirl, this magazine has nothing inappropriate, and can help with a girl's personal issues. Also, the magazine's site is amazine, with moderated boards that people can ask questions about their most personal issues and not be demeaned. I will definetly keep my subscription for a long long time.http://www.girlslife.com OR http://www.girlslife.com/g-blog (moderated blog)"
5,Excellent Bundt Thermometer !!!,"I didn't buy this thermometer from Amazon, but from a retail store, and my experience has been awesome !!! It works perfectly with bundt cakes, I have always had problem with baking times for bundt cakes, but now I have made 3 or 4 using the thermometer and the results have been outstanding."
4,Great smelling,"I read that cinnamon neutralizes the smell of cigarettes so I figured I'd try this out, since the smell comes into my apartment through my vents from the man that lives (and smokes) under me.I don't know if that's scientifically true, but it seems to work!! This fragrance really smells great, and it does seem to cut through the faint odor of smoke that I always have to deal with. My only complaint is that it doesn't last long enough! Other than that, while it is working, it definitely makes my apartment smell wonderful instead of smoky!"
4,YUM!,"I do love this scent! I don't know how well it really removes odors, but it sure does smell nice. :)"
4,nice deal but confusing,"This, as reviewed by others, is indeed a good buy so I won't go into details about the music. It isn't the very best but it is one heck of a good buy. The performance is very good but the quality of the discs is not top notch and the menu is maddening. The disc, when first inserted into the player, goes immediately into the music and must be manipulated to choose titles, etc. If you want to begin at any other point it takes some doing but this admittedly amounts to a bit of nit picking. I have listened to the whole cycle but even so, it is still not easy to play these discs in the way I would like it to be done, using a menu that makes sense. But aside from being a bit cumbersome with the menus I am very pleased with the purchase."
5,TNT Tweezer,Great tweezers! I like them better than my stainless steel Tweezerman slant pair. I am thinking about giving them as a stocking stuffer gift for Christmas this year.
2,Disappointed in these tweezers.,"These tweezers suck for plucking my hairs. Tips are too soft and not very sharp. I use them to pick up small stuff I drop such as needles, pins, mechanical pencil leads. Oh, I also use it to untangle necklaces that have tangled during travel."
4,Good Book for study,This is a useful book and cards tolearn from and so I do recommendit to anyone interested in learningand growing spiritually.
3,There are better references,"This photo reference is adequate, however, there are much better resources for the artist out there. For example, ""Paradise on Earth"" by Jim Thorsell puts this book to shame. It is not intended as a photo reference, and I came upon it by accident, but it is a far better reference. The photos are diverse and they are of superb quality. In addition, this is a coffee table sized book so the photos are of adequate size- often in the ARtist's photo reference series the photos are just too small to be of any practical use. Also, the photos just aren't that striking- they don't excite at all. Paradise on Earth will get you feeling creative guaranteed. The bottom line is that there are many books often at bargain prices that don't purport to be artist's photo references that do a better job than this book. I just wish I'd looked around before I purchased this book."
2,Variety Missing -,"When I need a reference book it is because I want to see the different angles, and a wide variety of types of animals and activity. This book ventured off too often into a lesson and show and tell for one piece of art. I think that is where the effectiveness is lost. If I want a ""how to book"" for an art project, I'll get a more descriptive and helpful book. If I want a reference guide to see angles, I am probably going to opt for a photographic books. I still was able to find some of what I needed, but was overall very disappointed in the content of the book and some of the subjects (whale tails and wet otters). I'm not sure I'd waste my money on another from this series."
5,Love this book,I love my art books and plan to keep all of them. I was in a bad accident and hope one day to return to art.
3,Does not include the companion CD,The ARRL Handbook is excellent as always but the book asSold by Amazon does not include the free CD.
5,2006 ARRL Handbook,"I've had this book for two years now and find it to be indispendable. I regularly use it as a reference due to the well organized format. As a matter of fact I use this as my first reference on almost any RF design subject. It's just easy to find information in it. The accompanying CD is a great bonus with some very useful software for filter design. If you're going to buy an RF design reference this is a good one, but I'd recommend the newest version for all the latest technology. Very good, highly recommended."
2,unsatisfactory,The zippers were poorly made I washed them and The zippers pulled right out 1st washing. I went to close them and zipper just broke.
4,New Insights on an Old Favorite,"Growing up in NY in the early 1960's I remember Casey vaguely as the manager of the Yankees (really Ralph Houk was manager in my early years) but more as the comic elderly leader of those miserable Mets. While I learned later of his great career as manager of the Yankees, somehow he was always portrayed as the marginal player who excelled as a bench leader. Creamer works hard to dispel this perception (which maybe only I had) and repeatedly stresses Casey's fine playing career. I appreciated gaining this new insight and found it a valuable addition to our understanding of Casey's wonderful career as a manager and ambassador of the game."
2,Disappointing,"I had read such glowing reviews of this book, and had enjoyed other Creamer works so thoroughly that I was suprised how uninspired I was while reading this. Perhaps I failed to be dazzled by Stengel the man. Perhaps I grew tired of the predictable retelling of Stengel's life, season by season, many of which held no remarkable events. Baseball in '41 is a much more rewarding book, full of wonderful anecdotes well recounted."
4,Dark Legend,"I really enjoyed this book. In this book, his lifemate is already Carpathian. This is a change. In several of the books, the lifemate has to be converted. I also love how the brothers are so close in this novel. Even though they are fighting, they still look out for one another."
2,Dark Disappointment,I have come to the conclusion that same phrases and scenerios are being re used. If I find myself in a dark unground cave once more.....Christine please brainstorm new places for romantic interludes.....
5,She did it again!,"I have read all of the ""Dark"" series and in fact everthing that Ms. Feehan has written. I think that ""Dark Legend"" is the best of the ""Dark"" series so far. Gabriel and Francesca's relationship was I think believeable because she had been so independent prior to meeting Gabriel so it makes sense that she try to remain as independent as possible. The feeling that Gabriel had for his brother Lucien just made him more ""human."" The only part of the story that strained a bit was Francesca's refusal to see Brice for the kind of person he really was - but we've all been there before. Up till now, Gregori and Savannah's story was my favorite but this one is now tops."
5,Can't wait till the next one!!!!,"Ahhhh!!! I wonderful addition to the ""Dark"" series. Riveting! Another wonderful book to be absorbed into."
1,I'd rather drink Turpentine and pee on a brushfire.,"This book was excrutiatingly bad. bad writing, terrible dialogue, no setting at all. It was supposed to take place in France, though you'd think they were in Ohio for all the description given...none. The ""hero"" was so one dimensional it was painful. The heroine could have been interesting if she wasn't such a wimp. The teenage girl is an almost interesting addition to the non-existant plot, but even her storyline was made childish by the amount of unrealistic coddling and her wimpiness. A girl who has been through that much is NOT that wimpy, or she wouldn't still be alive. Save your money and read Amanda Ashley instead if you like the vampire-damsel in distress genre."
3,Predictable,Feehan started me on my love for paranormal romance. But she paints herself into a corner and you know the outcome of the book before you read it. I will still always buy her books because they are interesting reading.
5,Fantastic,"""Dark Legend"" by Christine Feehan was great! Gabriel and Francesca are wonderful. I started to write a brief summary of the book, but I don't want to ruin anything for anybody. I'll just say that it is great. The main characters are a great match and Feehan introduces several secondary characters and the suggestion of one that leaves me anxious for the next two books in the series.After her last book, ""Dark Fire"" which I thought was a bit predictable and poorly written compared to previous books in her series, I was worried that she was writing this series too fast, and had lost the magic of the series. It was just a small blip though and ""Dark Legend"" is everything that I could have hoped for from Feehan, dark, sexy and mysterious. I'm back to anxiously waiting for the next installment in this fun series."
1,Contradictions and exceptions that don't make sense.,"Francesca is Carpathian. However she is almost as weak as a kitten, and she walks in day light.So...Feehan broke all her rules in order to make Francesca fit into her trademark heroine mould of a independant and strong woman who is then reduced to a defiantly, pitiful creature by the Carpathian male.NEXT...it makes no sense that Gabriel didn't know his lifemate when she was near. Hello?? All her other books are based on them knowing right away.It is also the same repititive descriptions that don't differ from book to book. Her books are less about the romance of the characters (except in the very beginning of every book) and more about the man protecting his helpless female who constantly gets into trouble because she won't accept his control."
5,Dark Legend,"I have never cared for romance books, but I am hooked on the Dark Series. You can't put the book down and after your through reading the story, you'll want to read it all over again. Keep those stories coming Ms. Feehan!"
5,Great Book.,Has good strong characters with lots of action. It also has some fun to it. But the main reason is because it's by Christine Feehan. Nuff said.
4,A lost lifemate and a Carpathian to boot! Oh Wow!,"This was a great rebound for Ms. Feehan. She started to come back, in my eyes, with ""Dark Fire"" but this completed it.Gabriel is an ancient who was sent out by Mikhail's, ""Dark Prince"", father to rid to world of vampires. He and his twin brother, Lucien, left together but his twin turned to the dark side..or did he? The brothers are finding it hard, still after hundreds of years, to break the bond between them even though one is the hunter and the other is the hunted. After a horrible fight together, Gabriel wakes and is looking to feed when he runs into a woman, Francesca Del Ponce, who offers her assistance. What comes from the chance meeting sets her life out of kilter and gives his a whole new meaning.I cant wait for Lucien's story!! *kicks the publishers in the pants* HURRY UP!"
4,"My favorite of the series, so far.","So far, this is my favorite of the series. It felt like this was the first time that the woman made the choice and did not have it forced upon her. I also felt like he was, by far, the nicest of the males. Nice is not really the word. Less alpha, is more accurate. Which is sort of odd since he is, by far, the most powerful and the eldest of the characters so far. I ""read"" this via audiobook and felt like it was very well done."
5,Dark Legend,This is a non-stop action book from the beginning to the end. I loved the book like all the other Carpatian books and I couldn't put this down.
4,I liked it!,"It was simple but interesting! I liked Darius story.I was sort of straight to the point. It brings you back to those days when the carpathian story was rather simplistic. If you have just started reading this series however, this is a book that will definitely grab your attention."
2,This story is an energy vamp,"The plot is ok for a cheesy story, but the writer repeats the same words over and over and over and over again until a 100 pages story takes almost 400 pages to finish.Reading it felt like you are spending too much energy for too little reward. Toward the middle of the book I tried to skip pages, and I find if you skip two in every three pages you can get a much better reading experience."
1,The worst Feehan book I've ever read,"How on earth can this book have gotten as high of a rating as it did? It was TORTURE to get through. When I'm in the mood for a happy little vampire romance, I pick up one of Feehan's books; but this book was excrutiating! It went on forever. I'm serious -- about 60% of this book was one of the 2 main characters professing their undying love, admiration, lust, or tormented desire for the other. The plot sounded like something someone came up with in about 5 minutes -- ""Quick -- in 5 minutes or less come up with a plot!"" It was stupid and made ZERO sense. The sad part was it started out with promise -- that was probably the one and only thing that drove me to finish this book. By the final half of the book I was basically scanning the pages instead of reading; searching for any key words that would lead me to believe that the plot would pick up at some point. This book was TERRIBLE!!!"
1,Blahhhhh,"I just bought this book after hearing great things about Christine Feehan work, I started to read the Dark Legend but found that the plot was so dull that I couldn't read it anymore. The actual theme of the story was great I really wanted to finish it just so I could see what happened, however I just couldn't do it. Maybe one day I will be able to finish the book, but as of right now I not going to even try."
2,it's ok.................,"as a huge fan of the anita blake series, this was poor in comparision.the story was good but i found most of the conversations between the 2 main characters repeating itself over and over and over and over again. it didn't give you a great background of what the differnece between the vampires and the carpathians were but enough to enjoy the story. guess i'd need to start start the series from the beginning to get it.i'd be interested to read another in the series to see if it's just this book or how the author writes. JMO"
3,We'll always have Paris?,"This may sound like a quibble, but DARK LEGEND is set in Paris, Paris is mentioned on several occasions, yet for all the local color and feel that I got, it could have been Baton Rouge! If Feehan is going to set her books in interesting places, she should visit them and make them a part of the book. It's more than atmosphere. We all know that in many ways her books and characters are interchangeable - in fact, that's why many of us return to them. Changes in setting and in atmosphere would really improve them."
5,Phaedra in a widescreen DVD -at last!,"For years I tried to track down a copy of this wonderful, powerful film (it's on my diverse TEN BEST list, need I say more?). This is an excellent transfer, superb tonality & sound. For me, it was like reliving the film when I first saw it in 1962!Now to the technical side. First of all, regardless of what Amazon say, ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD Video \""play only\"" devices, and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives"", you can probably ignore this warning (unless you're very, very unlucky). It plays with no difficulty whatsoever in my two Panasonic DVD multi-region recorders (one old, one newish). Secondly, although not mentioned, PHAEDRA is presented in 16:9 widescreen (1.77:1). Although the theatrical release was 1.85, even after having seen it a dozen times in the cinema, I still can't see anything that's been cropped."
2,not for kids,"very thin skins for wii remotes that see moderate usage, two have already ripped in parts. liked Nintendo's clear heavier duty cover much better."
4,"I've been living in the ice age, I just want to go to school...","My 3 yr old daughter got obsessed with sabertooth tigers after listening to the song ""Sabertooth Tiger"" by Breathe Owl Breathe. I found this and now, even a year later, she still loves him. He is the perfect size for cuddling and is really soft and cute too. I also bought a llama stuffed animal by the same company, and he is perfect too. This company makes great stuffed animals. It's fun to teach your child about the animal and then they carry them around for weeks!"
3,my opinion,"I'm using this joystick on a flight simulator, my only complaint is the stick angle, it is slanted forward at an un natural angle, straight up would be a lot more comfortable."
2,Needs re-engineering.,"I've had two of these and each time the z-axis (twist) control fails. I've read alot of negative reviews conserning the same. Two thumbs down for this product, I'm extremely unhappy with it."
5,Good Joystick,"Everything Works great, but the only downfall I have to say is that the throttle is really touchy. But it might be the games I play with it. (BF2)"
2,Logitech Extreme 3D pro joystick is so so,"Logitech has replaced 3 of these Extreme 3D pro joysticks for me under warranty,they all developed the same problem,a ""tick""in the joystick.I solved that problem by purchasing a CH Enterprises joystick,much better product,Logitech always took several months to respond to the problem,then after some roaring and snorting at me,they would replace the joystick."
2,I am returning mine to Amazon Today!,"I read reviews about this joystick both good and bad and still went ahead, took a chance and ended up wasting my money on it. On the first day use, it had lost it's calibration to the right as others have already mentioned before. I found a quick fix to get back calibration was in mid-game, to quickly remove and reinsert the USB plug and it would be good for about 10 more minutes before the right lean would go again. What a hassle. I am returning mine today to Amazon, then I am going to purhcase a Saitek Cyborg EVO Jpoystick. They have to be better....but I guess I will see. Too bad Microsoft isn't making Sidewinders anymore, this controller replaced a great Sidewinder Precision 2 that the hat switch went bad on after many years of use. Such a shame for an otherwise great controller. The stable, heavier base is nice not having to worry about the thing moving around on my desk. The button layout on stick for a right hander felt good."
4,Everything great but...,"I have had this joystick before and it lasted 3 years, which is pretty good for the 20$ I paid back then. I recently bought this. Right out of the package I hooked it up and in calibrating it, it showed me that it is always pulling up with no user interferance. It is a great joystick, and this didnt have to happen in my first 3d pro. It is easily fixable by trimming you plane up! Just thought people should know..."
4,Good,"This item is very nice. It works very well. Of course, I still need to get the software that I want, but that is another story..."
3,Seems like a good product.,I'd like to say l like this but never could get the program it was to be used on working. What what I can tell it would work great
1,"No way to calibrate, low life expectancy.","Don't waste your money on this one:-No way to calibrate.-Very unstable.-Will only for a few months (if you are lucky enough), then it won't center anymore, so you will have to end flying compensating the pull, thus, giving you an unfair handicap.Put in a few more $$ and buy yourself a Saitek."
4,Great joystick for the money,"- Joystick works great. Buttons 1 through 6 and the hat switch on the joystick have a great tactile feeling. Trigger pull is light.- The buttons 7 through 12 on the base are stiff and indistinguishable by feel. My left hand uses the keyboard instead of these buttons.- Because my left hand uses the keyboard, the reach to the throttle is a bit far, but the design of the joystick leaves little choice. The throttle feels well lubricated. (I've owned the Thrustmaster Cougar, Saitek X36, and CH Flightstick)- Base is wide and stable. It doesn't tilt even if you move and PRESS the stick to the limit.- There is a bit of wiggle, but it is still zeroed within the smallest deadzone limit in Freespace 2 and Wing Commander Saga. No wiggle in the twist axis.- The wrist rest is convenient for long flights.- The joystick fits in a 20 inch suitcase. Just pad the joystick with clothing."
5,Great price for the quality,"I am not a big gamer, just bought the joystick for a space flight game, but totally satisfied with the product.On a mac no install of software was necessary, just plug and play.In general I would expect this joystick to cost more, great value."
1,Worked great...for a month or so.,"I bought this joystick because of the great reviews. My experience however, is much different than most everybody else. It worked great for about a month, except for having to reinstall and recalibrate after two days of moderate play (2 hours). Now nothing seems to work. I have tried it on two different computers (both Windows 7), but the stick will not center. I have tried to recalibrate it time after time, look at online threads, kept on hold for 20 minutes on logitech's customer support line (I just hung up). Now I am waiting for a reply from an email I sent. This could take up to 48 hours. I guess those logitech guys are busy. I guess its time to move on to another manufacturer. Wish me luck."
5,None Better,"Good price and fast shipping! This is by far the best joystick I've ever used, and I have used a few. The control is excellent and very sensitive. It makes the games more enjoyable. It's well worth the price!"
1,Calibration nightmare,Bought two of these joysticks. After 2 months they both lost calibration and started drifting to the right. No means to recalibrate them. Save your money for something better.Cheap axis circuitry is to blame. Logitech will not fool me again.
2,Logitech xtreme 3d pro.DO NOT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've had this stick for about 10 months now,and i'm not too crasy about it.In the beginning your'e happy with it,it's your new joystick.But the stick itself is stiff and the buttons on the base are just plain hard to reach without looking down."
2,make sure its what you want.,"thought i wanted a joystick as a product it is well made arrived as promised well packaged in good condition,but do not beleave everything you read it is not compatable to multi app just because it has software install instruction and a usb cablke end. do your research before purchase."
2,Uncomfortable grip,First joystiick in a long time. Seems well made but the flange at the bottom right constantly hits against my wrist and after a while pretty painful. It is made for a right handed person and because of the pain I tried it left handed but the buttons on the base are on the left side. I will probably cut the flange off. Seems over sensitive with the DCS A-10C Warthog game and constantly activitating the side button with my thumb.
1,it didn't last 3 weeks,"When my Microsoft Sidewinder finally gave out, I needed to find a replacement for my Battlezone (I/II/TRO) and Flight Sim X PC addiction, since that make/model joystick was no longer available. The Logitech looked similar, and had the same basic functions - even tho I didn't like the button under the thumb grip ... but it started to input a slight right turn (X-axis) on its own after a week or two. I tried setting a dead zone but that didn't work, and I resorted to decreasing axis sensitivity within the game. I thought that was lame, but then it completely locked into a full left turn, which made it totally worthless! I tried unplugging/rebooting, but it was shot, after using it for only about 3 weeks."
5,Gamer,My last one stopped working after 3 years of use... It drifted in one direction.Got a new one and no complaints. WWII online player.
4,Does what I want it to do,"I'm reloading old games and needed a joystick. This one had enough good reviews here and on Newegg to give it shot. Turned out Amazon was about $10 cheaper than Newegg so I ordered it from Amazon.I reloaded Starlancer and have been bagging Coalition bad guys at a furious pace.While the throttle isn't in the most convienient location, this joystick does what I bought it for. There are more buttons than I need, but that doesn't bother me. For those who want everything on the stick, this will do fine for you too."
5,Joyous Joystick,Working in a USB lab I was able to test this device extensively before purchasing it. I'm using it with the X-Plane 9 program and it works perfectly. Being able to assign specific functions to specific buttons is a key for it's functionality. The item came very promptly in a box that was definitely bigger than it had to be. A great product from a great seller.
4,"Great, but a little hard on the wrist","First off, the joystick does everything it's supposed to. I have no complaints whatsoever about function.My only issue would be that after about 10-15 minutes, my wrist starts to cramp up. If I want to use all of the buttons (always :) ) then I keep it centered in front of me, but that means I have to hold my wrist at an angle. If I put the joystick a little to my right (and my wrist straight) then I have to reach across with my left hand. Either way it's not terrifically comfortably.That said, this hasn't discouraged me from using the joystick at all. I don't play enough for this to be a major concern. I won't replace it until it no longer works, then I'll look for something more ergonomic. Until then, I'll just take a breaks."
5,Will be buying third so old man can fly with my boys,"F22's for everyone. This thing is like a trainer without the giant cost, or a military conscription. I have enjoyed many Logitech products for years without any regrets."
4,Great Control.,"I used to play BF3 and works perfect, but in Bad Company 2 works so poor, maybe some configurations at game, I dont know. I dont have too much games to test it, but I'm happy if works in BF3, thats enough for me."
1,I would rate this zero stars if I could.,"I bought this joystick a few years ago (from Wal-Mart) and it was good for a while. I used it predominately for Battlefield:1942. Eventually it became so finicky it was unusable. Even with installing Logitech's crapware, I couldn't get the thing to stand still. I read somewhere that the rheostats that sense the movement are cheap pieces of crap, so I opened the stick up to check it out. Nothing I could easily repair.At least the throttle still works..."
1,Flight Sim 2004 Fans Beware!!,If Microsoft Flight Simulator is your main game like it is mine DO NOT buy this joystick or anything from Logitech period. The elevator and aileron controls work backwards and there is NO way to fix it. Yes I tried the software and it is no help. Logitech's support is a joke. Ask any any veteran Flight Sim. user and they will confirm this.
3,It's Okay,"It is not the best joystick I have ever used,but It work well for most games. I tend to wear out fiarly easy if you use it a lot so just have that in mind."
5,Great!,"I bought this joystick for use withMicrosoft Flight Simulator X Standard DVDon my PC. It shipped quickly and arrived within the acceptable period. It was in the original box and was packaged well. It came with a setup DVD but I did not use it. It worked perfectly and set up itself right out of the box. I now use it very frequently with my flight simulator, and it works excellently. I would recommend this product to anyone with a flight simulator."
5,"Outstanding, great functions and price.","I upgraded to this from a Logitech Attack 3, For just a few bucks more this is a very nice joystick. I got this for the hat, and for the twist roll function. The throttle is much more responsive than the attack 3, and has enough buttons that I don't run out. I have used thrustmaster, and a few force feedback joysticks, this is by far my favorite. For a full functional joystick on a budget, you can't go wrong with this one."
4,Good joystick for the price.,"Setup on Win7 x64 was easy. I got the latest software from the internet instead of using the CD, but it works well and lets me customize a lot which is great.My only con would be that the stick is a bit too firm for my liking and the Z (twist) axis is a little bit too loose. Neither of these are bad enough to give a bad experience, just minor annoyances.For the price, you can't go wrong with this joystick."
4,good control for different games,"I bought this controller and am quite pleased with it's reaction time and multiple button assignment. I mostly play racing and third-person games with it. It works great with 'Mashed', 'LOTR Return of the King', 'Star Wars: Rogue Squadron', etc. It doesn't lose button functionality quickly through hard-core use. It is for right-handed users only but has a comfortable hand-rest for long game-play time. I've used it practically every day since I bought it and it still is working fine. You may need to clean the gunk 'round the buttons from dirt, grime, or dust ever-so-often but so far it hasn't given me any trouble. I would recommend this controller for beginner gamer's and experts alike. The buttons are in a comfortable formation and easy reach access, especially when trying to press two buttons at once."
4,-Logitech 3D pro Joystick,This is a very satisfactory stick for MS Flight Simulator. And the price is right!
4,Logitech 3D joystick,The 3 D joystick works well. Would be nice if it had info on all the buttons. Some buttons are duplicate to others that work. Takes time to look for what you want the airplane to do. Do not see it as any better than my old msn Sidewinder Precision 2 joystick except it is heavier.
3,Easy to use BUT----,"I'm using this joystick with my X-Plane 9 flight simulator on my iMac. The basic design is sound but there are some issues with setting up and using the joystick. In the X-Plane 9 program one can assign different functions to different buttons, triggers etc on a joystick. Unfortunately, most of these assignments are not possible as this joystick with its 13 buttons makes the assignments not the program. There are a lot of buttons on this device that therefore remain unusable. For example, (unless I'm doing something wrong) I'm not able to control the flaps with a button on the joystick as I am not able to program it to do so. (If anyone out there in the flight simulator universe has a suggestion, please be my guest.)All in all this joystick seems to be well made, reasonably inexpensive, comfortable to hold and use and is able to control basic flight inputs (roll, pitch and yaw, trim) easily."
2,Worked great for a while,"This was, I repeat was, the best controller I had used. Sadly it lacks durablility. First it developed a downward drift. Then it had interfacing problems that required me to disconnect and reconect it numerous times while starting and exiting the game I was trying to play so that the throttle would work properly, it wouldn't go in reverse. Lastly, which made the controller unplayable, the downward drift exceeds the upward pull, so you can pull it all the way back and still be looking at your boots. Overall I liked the controller but it just doesn't stand up to long usage, not abusage."
1,Do not buy if you plan to map the buttons.,"This joystick feels nice in the hand, but it has serious flaws. Every time I spent about 10 minutes mapping the buttons to a game, the joystick would lose this information about 30 seconds into the game. I then went to the Logitech website, installed the latest drivers, and downloaded their pre-configured game maps. I still got the same errors. It had this mistake on over 5 games, both old and new. I even tried it on 2 different computers with no luck.It's a shame it has this fatal flaw because otherwise it was very decent for a cheap joystick. When I asked for help from Logitech, they kept telling me to ""download the latest drivers"" over and over, which I had already done.I must give it 1 star because I used it primarily for flight/space sims. It just can't give any functionality in that role."
4,i like it,"I loved it, I bought it to play mechwarrior online and doing well has a large capacity and buttons ."
5,Look Mom I'm a pilot,Just like being in the cockpit and flying a play your self. Can't imagine anyone not liking this. Try it!
2,WARNING!,"The Logitech Extreme 3D WILL lose center calibration over time. The more you use it the worse it gets. It was ok in the begining. I was able to get one for $5 (usa), and i'm glad i got it for that. I would not pay $40 for Logitech."
2,Good while it works,"My 5th one just started the dreaded left drift, so I'm through with Logitech. I love them while they work, but I can't keep buying a disposable $50 joystick!"
1,Has serious calibration issues...,"After just three days the stick began to behave erratically and randomly de-calibrate. Unplugging and reconnecting the joystick, or rebooting the computer, can sometimes restore calibration -- but only temporarily. At one time the Logitech forums were littered with posts from users experiencing similar problems, and a quick Google for 'Logitech joystick problem' will unearth hundreds of such testimonies.This defect exists in Logitech's entire range of joysticks -- they are an utter waste of money.Do not buy!Do not buy!!DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,disapointed,"The Logitech line of joysticks leave a lot to be desired. They work very well for a VERY short period of time. I have had 4 of them & every single one started spiking after only a few weeks. Flight surfaces started fluttering wildly & this would cause the planes noze to bounce around making it difficult to land shots on an nme plane. If you're playing a FPS game it might be ok but for flying, forget about it"
2,No Vista Drivers,There are no Vista compatible drivers for this device as of May 2007. Even LGS version 5.0 has problems.
4,Logitech Extreme,Great joystick. Very affordable and that 3rd axis really helps with rudder control. I am extremely pleased with it.
3,No way to calibrate....,"I've used this joystick for about a year now. Originally, the joystick worked perfectly with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004. But after about 9 months of moderate use (4-6 hours/wk), the joystick began to lose its calibration, especially in the twist portion. Having owned 3 joysticks previously, I was expecting this to occur because of typical fatigue on the spring. What I did not expect was that Logitech does not provide any software to calibrate the joystick, which is necessary to compensate for the inaccuracies caused by the fatigued spring. I tried to search online for any calibration utility, but to no luck. I don't know; maybe Logitech does have calibration software associated with the stick and I just missed it. But at this point, the stick has becoming annoyingly unaccurate that I'm almost ready to purchase a new stick...and I'll make sure ahead of time that it can be calibrated."
5,Great Flight Stick,"This is a sweet flight stick. easy to set up and calibrate. really a no brainer to use. feels really smooth, and the throttle and programmable buttons are all really easy to reach and use. No complaints. I use this to play MS flight sim 2004, and it works great. You just load up the game and go."
1,Short Lifespan,"Buy a Saitek. I have no had three Logitech Joysticks, two of them Extreme 3D's and all three have burnt out in no more than 6 months. Both times, the device will fail to be recognized in a fully functional usb port making the joystick useless.I've had a Saitek now for over a year and have had not a single issue with it.Avoid these unless you're looking to buy another one in 6 months. Along with the USB issues, this stick becomes loose and drifts after minimal use. If you're a heavy Flight Sim junky, this stick is poor quality. Recommend you spend the 100 bucks on a better stick as you'll be spending that much anyway to replace this stick."
3,break out forces,The springs on the stick are too strong and the break out forces are bad. The feel is not like on an actual aircraft. It would help if the construction of the unit allowed a peson to instll ther own springs to their own experience in an actual airplane. Note I have 6000+ flying time including stick and side stick controllers.
2,They say all things break eventually,"That stament is especially true with this joystick and when I use the word eventually I mean within a few weeks. Worked just fine until it started to loose calibration slowly. At first I could just unplug the USB and plug it back in, now even doing that does not appear to fix the problem. I've tried everything possible."
1,No Title,"Since the game I had purchased to use this controlled with didn't work on a laptop, returned the controller and never took it out of the box."
2,Looks Good But....,"I've used the wireless version of this joystick with no problems and I thought this unit would be just as good. The install was pretty easy as logitech have good software technicians. However, even though the joystick is recognized by the control panel in vista 64, you need a second piece of software to make the joystick work called ""the profiler"". This software wouldn't recognize the joystick and that renders the joystick useless in game. Though logitech support is the best in the industry in my opinion, after 30 plus hours, I've (we) failed to make the profiler software work. The support process caused several errors elsewhere on my computer that included corrupting my boot sector. Fun fun fun. My seller, Datavision, has a 30 day return policy that is coming up so I'll be returning this hardware.I've been a logitech customer for 12 plus years and I will still continue to be."
2,A loosen Joystick,I bought it for just 2 months and the stick is loosen now.The throttle control locates in a ridiculous place. Your wrist can move it when playing. Don't buy it.
4,Logitech Joystick rocks and fires,I purchased this to have a spare joystick. My current Logitech Pro works fine and the many configurable buttons are a hidden blessing as I can configure a button to perform all manner of things in various games. Recommend it as a good product which will last a good long time.
4,Works well... but...,"This was listed in the category 'Force Feedback'. It is NOT a force feedback device. I was very disappointed after I received this unit. Though I was disappointed because it is NOT a force feedback device, I decided to keep it."
4,Logitech 3D Pro Joystick,"Excellent product. Solid construction. Better than expected in this price range. All I had to do was plug it in and it was ready to go, no calibration need. Only thing I would like to see is a little less pressure need to move the joystick, maybe this will change as the product is broken in."
4,Very good,"After expending almost one hundred dollars on a Saitek X45 and having to throw it in the garbage, this Logitech joystick was a great relief."
5,Phil's Review,This product is really good. I use the joystick as a contoller for my Microsoft Flight Simulators and it works really good. I like the eight way hat switch and the throttle is in perfect position for the flight simulator.I also like the turn and maenuverability of the joystick. I would definetely recommend this joystick to anyone in search of a great joystick!
5,Joshua`s joystick review,"It works well,its shiny, its strong, its brilliant overall!!!!!!!!!! and and I use it on flight simulator 2004 A century of flight."
3,Decent bang for the buck,"I actually owned this same product in years previous, and knew kinda what I was getting when I bought this second. I had gotten my monies' worth out of the first before it went out completely so got a second. Basically its your standard cheap joystick. Probably not going to cut it for a hardcore simmer but for random fun it fits the bill. Not perfect by any means. The stick I just received is a little too sensitive on the left Z axis. An extremely slight twist to the right will net you next to nothing as expected, but the same force to the left will nudge it almost 1/4th the power of a full twist. Recalibrating doesnt fix it either, so I'm assuming its a flaw. To me its minor, but I'm sure to someone else it may totally break their experience."
4,Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick,"Great product, very reasonably priced. Buttons are well placed, & very functional. Buttons feel very strong & well built. Would definately buy again."
5,3d joystick review,"I bought this for my husband for x-mas to go with his Flight Simulator 2004 and he really enjoys it. It took a little while to get use to all the different controls, but once he did he was quite happy. Now to just get him away from the computer!"
3,"ok for flight sim, not great for anything else.","I have flight sim 2000 and it worked seamlessly with that. However, I made the mistake of trying to use it for shooters and some other games. It is cumbersome to assign functions to the buttons if they are not already bound. to many keys to remember if you are just going to use it for flight simulator from microsoft, fine. But beware w/ other apps."
1,10 to a lump of junk!,"Bought the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick.Pluged it in and played Battlefield 2 for months...The TWIST began to pull to one side...Attempted to calibrate, and IT DOSENT CALEBRATE!Contacted LOGITECH SUPPORT... and got punked!The automatron on the other line just kept repeating himself.""your warranty is expired, but we can offer a 20% discount for your next Logitech purchase""Are you kidding me!!!!!!!!!!!! LMFAO!!!!I explained again that the Joystick is not functioning...The tech repeated that he cannot help me...When Logitech gets your money......... they dont care thereafter.....Went on line and found videos how to attempt to fix your POS 3D PRO.Took it apart,,, and found hat the little chip that controls the TWIST was broken.Of course LOGITECH cant replace the joystick, or even send me a new $1 part.Their customer support is HORRIBLE... THERE IS NONE!!!!NEVER AGAIN LOGITECH.,. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"
2,Not very stable,"Stability, especially when using the twist function, is poor compared to more expensive sticks (Saitek, CH FighterStick, etc). In addition, long term reliability is poor (my X axis no longer tracks properly nor centers correctly).I'd skip this one. CH FighterStick Pro or Saitek X54 are good candidates."
1,Dont buy it,There is no way to calibrate it and it suffers fron axis problems. Logitech support is non existant.
1,Look Elsewhere.,The whole joystick worked well for a short while (2-3 months) until it started going off center. You can watch it go off center (Windows XP) in the control panel and see what your range of use is without being able to correct it in any way. The only way to recalibrate is to unplug/plug back in. Sometimes works...most times doesn't. Gets VERY jittery and forces you to use a high x/y dead zone. Throttle and twist never gave me problems.It would be a great joystick if it didn't break so fast.
1,who took the Logic outta logitech,"This stick loses its calibration every 5 mins, the rudder dosent work right and the pots are spikey, and thats after 1 month many others have had similar problems and Logitech dosent respond or says we need more info LOL. Do yourselves favors and DO NOT get this stick."
2,Don't buy it!,"Simple as that, look for another stick!It's beautiful, it feels great (if you're right handed) and it's cheap.BUT after 2-3 months of regular, not hard, use, the stick will go off center and won't be able to turn left anymore. Logitech knows this issue and suggests to run their calitration utility and recalibrate, but it doesn't fix the problem at all.If you're going to buy it prepare yourself to a continous unplug-reboot-replug-recalibrate routine."
2,not good for flight combat games.,"Well at first I want to get this joystick because it felt a lot smoothly. I purchased this stick so I could use for 3D space flight combat type games. But now then I hooked it on my computer, I noticed the X axis did not stay steady, along with the Z axis. There was no way re recalibrate it. I had a lot of trouble aiming steady with this stick in any 3d space flight combat type games.I tried everything to recalibrate that thing out but it never seem to work. I returned it back to the vendor and thank god I got the full cost of it back."
2,"DO NOT BUY, unless:","You don't mind replacing them every 1-6 months. Apparently I don't, since I've owned a half-dozen logitech joysticks.The pros:Great feel, nice arrangement and quantity of buttons.The cons:Logitech joysticks all suffer from faulty hardware. The joystick senses movement with potentiometers mounted on a gimbal, and it's these potentiometers that wear out. They get very noisy (which translates into my airplane starts spinning uncontrollably at random intervals) and drift, and there's only so much contact cleaner can do. However, Logitech will replace your faulty joystick (to my knowledge). Alternatively, I've just been exchanging them at a 3rd party retailer."
5,computer joystick,I was really surprised at the size of it and how many functions there are. I'm really enjoying it. Thank you.
3,no good for left handed use,"title says it all""upgrading"" from a very old wingman digital extreme with a bad buttonalthough right handed, i use the stick on the leftthere's a prominence on the left side to rest the right hand thumb.when using the stick with the left hand it sticks out into the handuncomfortablywould appreciate lefty stick suggestions with many buttons up top"
5,Great Product,"I purchased the Extreme 3D to use on my MS Flight Simulator- The product is all and more than what is advertised. It is metal, very sturdy and is extremely easy to set-up. In fact, all I did was plug in the cable and did not even run the software. It loaded and the flight stick was already calibrated.It works with precision accuracy - I am extremly satisfied and would strongly reccoment this product. You cannot beat the price for what you recieve from this Loditech product.AJC"
5,Great Joystick,I'm having a blast with this joystick. It's easy to customize and fun to use. Amazon's price (including shipping) still beat out Best Buy.
1,Too stiff to control... wrist pain as a result.,"the major thing i didnt like about this joystick is that it is too stiff in the x axis or controling the ailrones.after some time of using it i developed pains in my wrist.also the controling the rudder in the yaw axis is hard cause it is too sensitive even i lowered the sensitivity in fs 2004 to the minimum and also the rudder control doesnt have much distance to move .i tried to calibrate ,trying to find tips for improvement until i found more complaints about how stiff it is so i'm not the only one.it has also an inclination forward and so i had to hold my palm pushed forward so it is more comfortable to put it on a small chair or something like that to ease controling itwell after this first and short exprience ,i think that a good and serious hotas systme is prefered in order to enjoy flight simming experince through joystick."
4,Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick (963290-0403),"IT WORKS WELL , AND IT IS VEREY SMOOTHCANT WATE TO TRY IT ON A AIRPLAINE FLYING GAME"
3,Good cheap/short term joystick but...,"I have to say this is a good cheap, short term joystick if you need a backup one. If you want to use this for longer, I wouldn't advise it. I've had mine for about 4 months now, and the springs are fairly worn. I'm not a hardcore gamer, and certainly don't thrash on my equipment so I was disappointed to see how fast the springs wore down. With the springs worn down, the joystick doesn't quite self center accurately causing me to have to enlarge the dead-zone so inputs don't wander. This reduces precision, and really makes it hard to be smooth with inputs."
3,Pretty good joystick but there are a couple problems,This joystick is pretty good overall. It has a large base so it stays stable on your desk. It's well constructed. I haven't had any calibration issues like other people have. But you can't program mouse functions to button commands. It also has a very strong spring which wears my arm out very quickly. Overall I recommend this joystick. If you want a basic joystick. Personally I'm going to get on that has a seperate throttle and more buttons.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"I have exchanged this joystick 4 times at Walmart due to the calibration loss issue. 4 JOYSTICKS in 4 MONTHS. You will be sorry you bought it I assure you. people recomend Saitek, Microsoft, or CH joysticks. Find someone who recomends this Logitech and I'll show you someone with a dusty stick."
1,Garbage!,"It doesn't take long before it becomes uncalibrated. Uninstalling and installing it will correct it for a while, then it fails. Mine won't move but 67% to the right. It's a total waste of money!!!!"
4,Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick Issues,"The Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick is quite useful but has issues. I'm an experienced gamer and owned a number of Logitech products. However, this version of the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick is not quite up to previous versions. After using it a couple of times the joystick screws loosened. The unit did not calibrate properly; and using the twist control feature, it could not make accurate right turns compared to left.Absent these issues the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick is a good joystick for the price."
5,Best Joystick I have ever owned; flawless.,"I do not purchase high-end flight sticks; in the past, I have owned joysticks similar to this one, but never with as many features. You really get more than you pay for with this stick.The rudder control (twist axis) is an absolute necessity. The throttle control is very handy. I have had NO trouble whatsoever with this joystick - not one calibration issue (heck, I didn't even have to calibrate it). The only way to make this joystick better would be to add force feedback - but who needs that."
5,"Good value, good joystick!","I'm using this joystick for Flight Simulator X, and it works wonders. My friend uses the Saitek X52, and I prefer this. It's simple, and works great. I would definitely recommend this joystick."
2,Loses Calibration about every 2 min,"I will admit I am tough on Joysticks. I picked this up about a year ago and I have just ended up trashing it because it has gotten worse and worse with keeping calibration. I have even noticed that when setting the calibration in Windows the stick no longer does full movements all around the box and the Twist axis also will not max out to both sides. I also HATE the throttle control on this thing. I have had more problems trying to keep the throttle perfectly centered so I am not moving planes, Choppers, and vehicles in forward or backward direction. If you are like me and tend to max out the different axis on you joysticks and tend to push a little harder than normal this stick will drive you nuts."
4,so far so good,"An exceptional feel for a cheap stick, very stiff very precise.Im playing IL-2 Forgotton Battles and the precise aiming is a terror.(i am replacing a MS sidewinder precision pro 2)and this stick is far superior."
2,Will not center,No matter what I do I cannot get this joystick to center. From the door this joystick would not calibrate properly.
2,"Solid to start, but don't expect it to last...","I have two of these. Neither of them work very well anymore. The twist function, which was important for the games I wanted to use them with was inaccurate at best. It wasn't bad when I first purchased the joysticks, but about 6 months to a year later they had degraded to the point that the games were no longer enjoyable...more like frustrating because of the joystick.You may get lucky and get one that lasts, but even though I said 6 months to a year it was very infrequent use...perhaps once or twice a week at the most."
4,"Awesome, makes for a more realistic experience","I purchased this controller primarily so that I can use it within Microsoft Flight Simulator X and some combat flight games. Overall I am satisfied and recommend this controller as a relatively inexpensive way to get your flight hobby started. I've heard reports of its accuracy failing over time, but I've had mine for awhile already and I'm very satisfied with its performance."
4,great for my uses,"i dont like how thin the base is cause i use it on my lap, but everything else works great, calibrated perfect, works with all my gta series great!"
1,Dead joystick,My Mac recognizes the joystick but it does not registers any movement. I noticed that all questions in the Logitech forum regarding Mac (I found them thru Google) were no longer available. I guess that now this is a PC only device?I am returning it today.
4,flightsim joystick,works very well but I find the centering spring pressure is stronger than is realistic.
1,Not Great,Bought this for husband. does not work well connection point to computer did not last long. Broke in a few days.
2,"Not sure ifit just me, but...",This thing absolutely does not work with my Mac. I tried every program I could find and it is still pointless. I'll be selling it on Craigslist.
3,"cheap, only worth that","no driver for mac,and there is a little difficult to control when you want to yaw & roll at the same time"
2,Nearly Unuseable,"Like everyone else says, It tilts to the left on the game's I've tried it with (BF2 and Flight Simulator)"
1,Junk,No way resembles how an airplane flys. Removed mine and gave it away. Easy to install and use. I would not recommend.
1,Not for Macs at all,"This is the biggest farce from Logitech. Apple OS 9 requires an inputsprocket or config file for this joystick. Logitech does not have one. Contact Logitech support to get this to work and they tell me that they do not support Apple OS anything, that the USB and joystick are ""Mac Compatible"" which is like saying that you can use a tennis ball to play golf if you wanted.There is no support for this. There are no Mac users that have ever got this to work without dumping time and $ into configuring a third party app to interface with this. I have returned mine and am looking into something that actually does work with Apple OS (X or 9)"
1,Poor construction -- Bad software,"Summary: This joystick is junk. Spend a little more money and buy something better. Although it has a great feel, the hardware is of the lowest quality. They don't last and are constantly loosing calibration. Furthermore, the certain features like the throttle slider, never work properly (full throttle on the joystick doesn't make full throttle in the game). Also, the software is poor. Both the drivers and their task-tray application are sub-standard. Looks like Logitech outsourced everything about this joystick. Cheap junk!"
5,Not a better joystick out there,"I have had this joystick for 8 years now and have had no problems with this joystick at all..It is just the best one out there...I paid back in the day 80 dollars for it...This thing has out lasted some of my friends very expensive models and they can't believe it so they also bought one from Amazon...They are very well made and heavy..You think buy looking at it that is is just very light cheap plastic..But it's not..This thing is heavy duty for sure...And it is very easy to set up you go to the Logitech website for the new drivers for whatever system you have and download it..This thing works on all systems...XP,Vista,Windows 7 you name it...I can't believe it is only 25 dollars now..It is worth more for sure..."
1,Disappointing,"After just a few uses, it stopped recognizing commands properly and in a couple of instances sent the wrong command to FSX. I reinstalled the Logitech software twice and reinstalled fsx as well...all to no avail. It is currently awaiting garbage pickup. I am switching to CH products hoping to find a better solution. BTW, I am fairly savvy and am running these applications on a brand new and quite robust laptop. Bummer."
4,Great Buy for the $,"I bought this joystick because I had one before and it worked great for a couple years. My last one got fried some how but it lasted a while. This joystick is great for someone who wants to play around with a flight simulator. It may not be the best joystick on the market, but it's a great buy for the money!"
4,Good solid purchase,"This was a good solid purchase. I bought it for CD/DVD PC game called ""LOCKON"". Easy to use and configure."
3,Well made but high price tag,"Well made and does the job just fine. It will work on almost any 12v battery. Naturally it does not replace what an electric battery charger can do and in the same amount of time, but as a trickle charger for car and boat batteries this is all you need (other than some sunshine). The only negative is that these Sunsei solar panels are far more expensive than they need to be. They are made in China and a 18w panel of this quality should be 30-50% less than what the Sunsei brand demands. Coleman is pretty much the same product, all coming from ICP Solar in Canada, however the Coleman panels cost much less."
3,Good but delicate,"This panel seems to be well designed and works well. The connectors are very functional and allow you to easily interconnect a number of panels. I particularly like the indicator light on the panel that lets you know that it's working. However, the solar cell is covered by glass that is very delicate. I once picked up one of these panels by the corner of the frame and this generated enough stress to crack the glass. I don't know how long the panel will last now that it's cracked."
3,Excellent sourcebook for the experienced sewer.,"I would like to start by letting all who got here by looking for a hakama pattern know that they have not found one. The first review of this book is a tad misleading in that respect. What they have found is a valuable resource for making a kimono. I bought this book looking for a hakama pattern and was sorely disappointed, but enjoyed the detail on technique so much I cannot bring myself to return it. I am an experienced sewer, though I do not design my own patterns. And I am looking forward to my first attempt at creating one of the pieces described in the book. But the 3 rating I gave it is because of the complicated descriptions. If you have no patience with detailed instructions, do not buy this book. If you are looking for a more authentic kimono pattern than is commercially available, you found it. Good luck! If you try any of these patterns, I think you'll be pleased with the result."
3,Making Japanese Clothes.,The book is well written and very complete in the detailing of Japanese clothes. The title is a bit misleading though. It implies that there are patterns in the book although this is not the case. There are instructions on how to create your own patterns. While this may not be too difficult for an experienced seamstress it may be a bit disconcerting for a beginner.
3,so-so book,"Has some helpful information but there seems to be too much emphasis on westernizing the kimono look. The helpful illustrations are rather crudely done and not as helpful as they could be, except for the pattern for making and the steps for sewing tabi (traditional Japanese socks)Unfortunately this is the only book availible in english showing all the steps to making Japanese clothes. A number of necessary clothing patterns for making a real kimono set are not included in this book."
5,"Comprehensive, thorough, well-written","I already had a copy of this book and showed it to a Japanese friend who does a lot of traditional Japanese fabric arts. She knew of the author, had met him, and was very impressed with the book. It contains patterns and discussions of all the traditional Japanese articles of clothing and their construction. There are many good photos. It is written by an American who studied the subject in Japan, and geared toward Americans who want to make these clothes either by strict traditional methods of hand-sewing or by modified methods with a sewing machine. The paperback edition I have is 20 years old or so, and I bought a used one just like it for my Japanese friend, and it arrived in very good condition. She loves it and plans to use it for inspiration in her work."
2,Good for general ideas.,"I bought this book hoping it would guide me through making a hanten jacket. I used the measurements to make a pattern and proceeded to make a muslim. The results were totally unsatisfactory. I recommend this book as a good idea book, especially the photos of garments that have adapted the traditional patterns to modern garments. However, as a book of techinical instructions on how to make a hanten or a wraparound jacket I found the system very unsatisfactory for me."
1,Make Your Own Japanese Clothes,"I was not happy with the information in this book. I was looking for simple pantsuit type oufits; short tops and ankle-length pants. A simple kimono design would have been nice. I resold this book a while back so my memory is not perfect, but I recall a lot of kid clothes and the photos were unappealing. Most of the clothing looked uncomfortable and fussy in that there was a lot of detail."
4,Handy,"It's a nice summary of issues, not too much ramble as with some books on the subject. I found it offered a great deal of support. Worth getting. Only thing I saw as a downside was the overly optimistic view that if you try hard enough with schools, they 'get it'... Maybe some do. But that wasn't our experience. We've been continually dismissed and treated like idiots. Unfortunately there's no chapter on homeschooling."
4,This Book Is Absolutely Perfect...,"...especially if you are a film student and/or studying for a movie trivia game show. I love that it has loads of pictures and tables/lists. Plus, it has any and everything you need to know about the movies. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who would like to know more about film. I promise, you won't be disappointed! :-)"
5,Relatively comprehensive look at the American Film Institute,"There are plenty of good books available on what films are out there and other books of the art of making films. We can find vertical market books on specific subjects that are film related. However this book is exactly hat the title implies. There is more depth to this book than just an overview or an introduction book. Although this book could be a good coffee table book it also makes a good desk reference book.With 608 pages, most containing partial if not totally glossy color snaps from the famous and obscure movies of our time. The different subject or chapters have color coded tabs on the edge of the page allowing for quickly finding the information sought.Although designed as a reference I found it more fun to read page by page picking up gems here and there that would never have been found by just reference searches."
5,Love This Belt,"This belt was one of the best purchases I have made I a long time. I have added this belt to many outfits making my wardrobe come alive again. I love the fact that it had so many belt holes making the size of the belt limitless. The only problem I had was keeping the excess of the belt from flapping around so I had to clamp it shut. Otherwise, it has been a great addition to my closet."
5,This is a great bag for my Steiner binocs,"This product is well made, and my Steiner 7x50 marine binocs fit in the bag perfectly."
4,Bag,I got this for my husband Steiner binoculars. He preferred this bag over the one that came with the binoculars. Very convenient and portable.
1,Bad Service. Late Arrival. Overall HORRIBLE!,Bought 1 book and it was supposed to come 3 weeks ago and never showed. They gave slow responses to e-mails and false information. I do NOT suggest this!
1,Horrible. Just horrible.,"I have no clue why my high school depends so much on these books. I show these textbooks to my family members (who happen to be from Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Spain) and we all just laughed at the sheer lunacy of these textbooks. We'd learn more Spanish in ""America: The Book"" than from the Holt books. The translations, dialogue, reviews, and examples were all trivial and laughably disorganized. How do they expect students to learn Spanish when 60% of the text is in English? There are much more efficient and easier ways to learn Spanish, the easiest language on Earth, than from an arbitrary slop of Holt publishing. I recommend Rosetta Stone, instead."
1,This book teaches nothing!,"This Spanish book is extremely hard to understand and it is also pretty useless. Sure, it will teach you some words and phrases, but it is not good al ALL if you have to have a conversation. There is barely (or no) explenation as far as how to use certain things. I have been using it (sadly) for 3 years now, and I have not really learned anything. The only thing i know know are the numbers...but they are very easy and don't need any skill to learn. Sad, isn't it? Although it is inexpensive as far as textbooks go, I highly advise you NOT to purchase this book, for it teaches nothing! This book is aweful!"
2,Too easy,"This past school year I took Spanish I with this textbook. I was never so unchallenged and unmotivated in my life. I gave this book 2 stars for vocabulary building, but don't count on it for anything else."
2,A decent Spanish textbook for average-slow paced learners.,"In my school they used this book for Spanish I. I found that although it was adequate, it went at a pretty slow pace. Throughout the entire book, as far as verbs go, it only teaches the present active verb conjugations, the simple concept of being going to do something, and at the very end, the present progressive, which translates to I am running (etc.).One of the better parts of the book was the vocabulary. There were a good amount of nouns (although not as many verbs), and they were grouped somewhat coherently."
2,Very Poor,"I found this book to be very poor in the teaching of Spanish. Most of the teaching relied upon vague references and much guess work. Many key areas of the spanish language were very briefly covered and had little to no explanation for the usage of words. Most of the teaching was with examples that didn't seem to follow any rules. Ultimately, I disliked this manual and the course using it. The ONE good thing about it is it teaches numbers very well and basic greatings. However, I wouldn't expect anyone using this book to ever learn how to converse in long conversations. Ultimately, if it wasn't for a few saving factors, this would be at the bottom of the barrel.- Travis"
1,No wonder Holt is discontinuing this book,I am a high school Spanish teacher. If only my school had enough to buy new texts. This one is very poorly done. I thought the old Vallette-Vallette Spanish for Mastery was bad until I saw this one.
2,Disappointing,"The Ven conmigo series seems to be quite extensive and presumably it is widely used. I have the level 1 book which has a lot of attractive illustrations but there are many places where the reader is given the direction ""Escuchemos"" and the set of CDs or audiocassettes for Level 1 is listed on the publisher's web site at over $250. I can purchase other Spanish courses for a lot less."
5,So Excited!!,"This was one of my favorite books as a kid, and my favorite author. It started a life long love of Frankenstein and I was sooooo effing happy to finally find a new copy!! Could not be happier"
2,Too Much Like HIs Other Books For Me,"What I start I finish and I did finish but really bland, vanilla and nothing new worth taking the time on ... if you hadnt read any of his other books, or any self help books for that matter it might be okay ... but weak at best"
3,A simple story with deep emotion behind it,"Paper Nautilus is a simple story of simple people which takes place around Jack and his niece , Penny . Written in Flashback , the story started with the end : a marriage between Penny and her boyfriend . Although the story is not at all breathtaking or fabolous , it is a very emotional book , where the story show how ""boring"" Jack and his brother Peter (penny father) contrast each other . Where Jack chose to be responsible and "" boring"" and Peter is born to be ""special"" and adventurous . Peter is loved by everybody and Jack is just an ordinary guy that most do not even pay attention to. However , in the end , Jack unselfishly dedicated and gave his WHOLE life to take care of Peter's daughter (whose own mother , peter's wife , ran away with other man )."
1,Buy something else,"This was a big disappointment and I was very grateful to receive a refund.The canvas bag is very lightweight and rough, cheap material.The metal parts are flimsy and tacky looking.It is wobbly when assembled.I would advise anyone to spend their money on a different product."
1,Don't Buy It,The top of the bag is made of cardboard and bends. It wobbles. Extremely flimsy. There are many other choices out there. Don't waste your money.
5,Laundry hamper,"I am very satisfied with this hamper, absolutely durable and a great item in the house. The size, length and height wise was perfect in the corner of the bedroom. I am very happy to found such item through amazon and for the price that I paid. I been using this item for more than a year now, I've washed the hamper numerous times and carried it with full loads, still looking brand new."
5,follow the instructions,as long as you look at the diagram (unlike I did) it will take you 5 minutes to put together... adds a vey nice touch to the bathroom or wherever you decide to place it.
5,The Largest Folding Hamper I have ever seen,This canvas hamper is very large and will hold lots of dirty clothes. They look so professional in style with all of that chrome and does not require much care; an occasional dusting will do as my washing units are in the basement. I also like the great idea of being able to take the canvas bag off the unit and machine wash the bag.
3,Fun Book,I love to listen to Jeanne on Laugh USA and Blue Collar Radio and this book is filled with her fun stories. It is the perfect airplane companion.
3,"Good build quality, poor mounting design","I got this stock to mount on my Spyder. The stock itself if well built, lightweight, easy to fold/unfold. My biggest problem with the this item is that it mounts to the grip with a single screw, allowing it to pivot under force. It was provided with two nylon set screws to keep it from moving rotating, but they are insufficient. I would recommend looking for an alternative design if you plan on using this on a Spyder."
1,Died in under a year.,The power supply died in ten months. It was covered under warranty but this is a common problem I've come to find out. This shouldn't happen.
2,Avoid this like the plague,"Three months and it died. Even though Toshiba has made good on their in-home warranty, there is no excuse for such a failure. Spend the money; go into debt, but get an LCD instead. This line of Toshibas is riddled with problems from the picture quality (which mine was fine) to power supplies dying. I've read these complaints online repeatedly. Toshiba should be ashamed of such poor quality. Supposedly, Toshiba didn't even make these - Orion did, if what people say is true."
4,Old School Great Buy..!,tube technology is a proven science thats been around for 50 years ...you won't find the problems of the Plasma and LCD tv in a good tube television....!!!! i had this baby for some time now and i don't regret anything ...! i have direct tv by way of HDMI cable to the tv and the picture quality is great...! i wanted a little more so i hook up a indoor HDTV Terk antenna to my SAT. box then on to the Toshiba and it was worth every penny ... i recorded off the antenna the Macy's thanksgiving day parade and the opening Olympic ceremony's and the picture was absolutely beautiful ... every color was ROYAL ..!!! you had better buy one while they are still around ... you won't regret it ..!!!!!!
1,Broken within a year,"I own a Toshiba 26HF84A. It's a very good TV for the price, but it stopped working only 10 months after I bought it. I turned it on one day and it blew out. No picture. No sound.My friend owned a Toshiba HDTV and said the same thing happened to him less than a year after he bought his."
1,Obsolete text -- don't waste your time,"Once upon a time this book may have been useful, but now this text is more than 20 years old and badly in need of a revision. You would be better off to read a more up-to-date work instead, such as the books by Rothman and Greenland, Clayton and Hills, or MacMahon and Trichopolos."
4,Behind Enemy Lines: The True Story of a French Jewish Spy in Nazi Germany,"A really good book, well written. Really held my attention. Gave a good insight on life in France during the Nazi rule."
3,Much improved,"The negative comments re the first edition are justified, but for this much better second edition clearly a lot of work has gone into improving the Yunnan section (the bit I can comment on)."
2,Nothing New,"I had been eagerly awaiting the 2002 edition of this guidebook to South West China to help me plan my upcoming trip throughout Sichuan and I was very disappointed. All it did was lift the section on Schuan out of the Lonely Planet ""China"" guidebook and reprint it. Most of the smaller towns and attractions that I was looking for are not even included. If you have any other decent guidebook of China already, this will be a waste of money."
1,So BAD!,"I really like Maryam Rajavi until I actually got to know her. Here, don't buy the book, let me just tell you the only thing that is repeated in there the whole time:Islam is Evil and condemns women; lets all forget God.Honestly, I don't need to spend even 6 dollars to get a nice novel to say that.If you want something good to read, try some of Harun Yahya's books. The changed my life, and if you give it a chance to just read ONE book, they will change your life too. Guaranteed."
3,Sweetness w/o Equal,"Funny that ""Vanilla"" should be such a rarefied taste, yet seekers of information on the musically arcane have few other places to turn if they want to learn more about Claudine Longet, Curt Boettcher, the Mike Curb Congregation, Harpers Bizarre or the Doodletown Pipers. The man who wrote the definitive volume on elevator music is back with a survey course on the sweet AM radio fodder that has been unfairly dismissed as MOR schlock but has come back into vogue thanks to folks like the Aluminum Group, Cinerama and even Belle & Sebastian. I find the writing at times somewhat ponderous for a sound that is lighter than air, but Lanza's sly wit helps alleviate his pedantic tendencies. He titles his chapter on the sweet'n'sour sound of the Carpenters ""Someone Left the Cake out in the Rain"" and his chapter on ABBA is called ""Vanilla Ice."" You'll likely learn something as you read both."
4,Tradedy & Hope,I read Tragedy & Hope a second time this summer and found it even more compelling this time than the first time through it. It is by no means light reading and takes an effort to stick with it. The copy I recently purchased was for a friend who showed an interest in the book from our talks while I was reading it this second time. I highly recommend Tragedy & Hope to anyone interested in a somewhat different explanation on how western civilization arrived at where we are today.
5,Tragedy & Hope: A History of the World in Our Time,"An amazing book that gives you the big picture only just started reading it an no doubt it is something you could easily spend 1 year reading, there is so much to think about and do further investigation into. I would advise anyone thinking of taking some time out to go on a long holiday to a desert island as long as it has the internet to do further investigations and enjoy it!"
4,Tragedy and Hope,"Interesting, informative, well researched. It should have been bound in 2 volumes, as a one volume edition it is too thick, heavy and cumbersome to handle and interferes with the reading enjoyment."
5,200 years of western civilization in a single book,"This is a long book, still it is a very concise analytical resume of 200 years of western civilization around the world. It is the life long research of the brightest historian in modern times.I studied history during 13 years at school, wasted time. A lot of propaganda and a few distorted facts to prove it. Get your history straight.The only issue: it does not cover the last 43 years.If someone knows a recent history book as good as this, please mention it."
5,CLINTONS' MENTOR !,"The late Prof. Carroll Quigley,of Georgetown University taught former President Bill Clinton ALL he knows-or so said Clinton at the 1992 Democratic convention.I've had this book for 30 years and its contents NEVER fail to amaze me.If yiu want to know the truth about the Cecil RHOADS sociey,Clinton was a member,or the anglophile Council on Foreign Relations(CFR),Bill was a menber of it too,READ THIS BOOK.Prof Quigley,who died in 1978,was an insiders' insider,he also had an influence on the late Sen. Joe McCarthy.The author of this review is very much a leftists."
5,Don't stop here...,"Line up some free time for this tome of dangerous ideas. Carroll Quigley is undeniably one of the greatest mind expanding double agents ever. As soon as you're finished with this one proceed directly to 'Weapons Systems and Political Stability', Quigley's final writings in a loose collection. Packed with many a memorable line."
4,"Interesting book, daunting task to read it all","I would consider this to be the best reference book I have encountered. The problem is, it is soooo long. It has taken me months to get the point I have reached in the book. It's not exactly a children's book. Very good source of information however."
4,Get It.,"BTW. If you want the book now, the John Birch Society, aka The New American book store sells the book too. It's usually availabe right away--in stock.Good Reading."
5,an absolute must for any bonanza fan,"the audio and video are both excellent. but thats second to the actual story content. rose for lotta was the pilot for the series and shows ben as a bible quoting patriarch and almost too harsh a character to be likable. a far cry from the warm nurturing father figure he evolved into. the difference in the other characters is not quite as noticable. but its really interesting to compare all 4 of our heroes in this episode to the ben, adam hoss and joe of the early and mid sixtys. the scenery is specactular in both episodes and the stories both well written. the truckee strip quest stars a young james cobourn and is every bit as enjoyable as rose for lotta. watching these episodes a trip down memory lane even for non bonanza buffs."
2,Out dated,The blank album is beauiful however the advice in the book is greatly outdated and to be expected since it was published in 2000. Note you can't find protective sleeves for the pages since it's an off size and the advice for genealogy software is outdated. It's a good buy for the album and it does contain good ideas to get started but she really should have left genealogy alone...hasn't a clue.
1,Mediocre,"Content is biased towards medication use first, psychotherapy is presented as secondary. The opposite is true. Most of these kids are greatly helped by the right type of psychotherapy and do not require medication. What parents need to be guided is to find the right therapist, one who is experienced in the practice of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with children. Service was excellent (the people who sent me the book)."
3,Book is Ok,"CVS is a pretty simple and good enough version control system compared to the likes of ClearCase etc. The book is fairly complete. Wish it dealt a bit more with security of repository.Regards,Rahul Bhargavahttp://www.wandisco.com/cvs"
3,mixed bag,"This is one of the Irma label's least successful compilations. It's not bad, just not as consistent as others they have put out. The music on here is a mixed bag of ""soul"" spanning the 70s, 80s, and 90s. It starts off with a really nice version of Stevie Wonder's ""Golden Lady"" by Jose Feliciano, but then come the jarring presence of Driza Bone and later Lisa Stansfield and even Me'Shell Ndegeocello. Again, none of this is awful, but it just doesn't flow or fit the mood of the rest of the album. Tracks by Beats International, Omar, and the Blow Monkeys are better, but not really prime soul classics either. An interesting idea for a compilation, but not one that works that well."
1,Worst book ever,"Do not waste your money on this book. I was so excited when I bought it, and couldn't believe how disappointed I was. Boring and illogical, a very poor writing style. Save your money and your time... this isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
1,Bad Marks Not for the Original Author but for Tuska the collector,"The stories in this book are all Classic L'Amour and are excellent! However, they are NOT presented as Louis L'Amour would have wished them to be. ALL of the short stories in this book are available in AUTHORIZED editions from Random House - Bantam Books.You see, when the author decided to release his very early works from the Pulp Fiction era in book form, he carefull chose the version of the story to be printed. He also chose the publisher he wanted to release them.This Collector, John Tuska, and his publisher, Leasure Books, chose to ignore Louis L'Amour's wishes and have published this book. Not only that, but the collector John Tuska has the unmitigated gall to criticize the very author he has re-published for the sole purpose of making money!!I have boycotted this book and I recommend any and all Louis L'Amour fans do the same in memory of a great American and out of respect for his wishes!"
3,Information Overload,"I felt like this journal had too many questions. ""Who were the teachers you didn't like,"" ""Were you ever lost while traveling?"" ""Do you remember the first hotel you stayed in?"" ""What is the best restaurant you've eaten in while traveling?"" ""Have there been times when you questioned your religion?""The book is 143 pages with an average of 3 questions per page. The grandfather book that I purchased was so much better. It was much more to the point and had questions that my parents could still answer. My mom doesn't remember which local political candidates she has supported and why. The questions are too much. The book seems more like an interrogation than a loving memory journal."
5,Great gift,This was the perfect gift for my perfectionist mother! It asks for details that she wouldn't think to record. She was so excited she started on it that day and says Ill have it by the end of the month! Now I'm excited!
1,A Grandparent's Book,"This book was returned as it had no space whatsoever in it to record any information about the grandchild's parent's life, or the grandchild's life. I can't imagine my grandchildren being so enthralled with my background to want a book only about me. Other memory books have a nice mix of info on grandparent, parent and child making them a much better read. I turned this in and bought Grandmother Remembers instead.Grandmother Remembers a Written Heirloom for My Grandchild"
4,Exactly what we needed for moving!,This product was thick and easy to use. Great for large furniture and delicate items...especially if you live in a rainy city like Portland where inevitably you move during a downpour.
3,The hole is huge,"I was going to improvise a handle but the hole is stud size. If you are buying this to move, I would recommend the one with the handle."
2,Not for Dualshock 3,"I was looking forward to this, but alas it doesn't charge the Dualshock 3. I hope this helps someone with a newer controller -- try something else."
3,"Received item different as advertised, but it works","Playstation 3 Dual Charge ACI bought this product last week (sold by Amazon.com, not third party) and I had a very unpleasant surprise: the charger's output current here at Amazon's site is stated to be 1000mA but the unit I received is only 800mA. It's a little hard to find this information at Nyko's website, I found it only at the product's enlarged image (http://www.nyko.com/img/nyko/products/large/DualChargeAC.jpg , better seen in: http://www.k-netsystems.net/images/83015.jpg)This 800mA unit charges my PS3 joysticks, GPS (Mio C220), PSP 2000 and portable speakers, but do NOT charge iPhone (1st gen), the phone fails to recognize the USB energy from this charger (weird but that's what's happening)."
1,Dont Work,Just got it in the mail and took a long time to get here. doesnt work it dont charge anything :( bah no sense to send it back it would take weeks round trip. ill just chalk it up as a loss. wasted the money to get this. i wont hold it against amazon though they have always had good service so this wont detour me from shopping here they are not responsible for junk others sell. ill just end up tossing it in the trash. just warning people about this item if mine was defective i bet at least 80% will be. it was a good idea but probably needs a better company to accomplish it.
4,thank you,Sorry for the delay. I received the item in a timely manner and was in great condition. Thank you!
5,Great Item,"I purchased this for my husband and he loves it. Holds a lot, does not take up a lot of space and it has great organization. Additionally, it is not the dreary black or grey or dull colors that toiletries kits usually are."
3,"A nice bag, but not that useful....","This bag was pretty sturdy, but I was a bit disappointed. For one, the mirror was fairly cheap and barely usable. Second, while it's not really the bag's fault, but the ample space for toiletries is pretty moot, since airport security now restricts all liquids to 100ml / 3oz. This meant I had to carry all my toiletries in a separate plastic baggie anyway, so all of the bigger elastic straps went pretty un-used. I would have liked a few more slots to hold razors and/or the blade cartridges.It was probably more useful before restrictions, but it could now really use a redesign, at least if you're flying. The one thing I did find nice were the noticible colors (I got yellow). The color made it easy to find among your other packed items."
4,Perfect size and holds just the right amount of stuff,It appears to be small but this bag holds more than you think. It's a little pricey but it's worth it. I've already put stuff in it and it looks like it will hold a lot more than I imagined. It's just perfect for those items you don't want crushed in a suitcase or if you just want to keep things together. Well worth it.
5,"Rick Steves 9"" Traveling Toiletries Kit, Black",The kit was exactly the same as on the RS website. We used it in Italy and it came in very handy in those small bathrooms that have no place to set you things so I hung it from a towel bar. It worked great.
4,More than a biography,"In the emotional fervor of revolutions, the protagonists are often portrayed as larger than life creators of history. In The Persian Sphinx, Milani restores humanity to the story of a man who is more notable for what he could have done than for what he did.Hoveyda, like so many Iranian politicians through history was complicit in betraying his ideals through silence and acquiescence in the face of encroaching authoritarianism. The haunting story of Hoveyda shows us the paramount importance of integrity in leadership.With a tumultuous period in Iranian history as a backdrop to the story, the reader gains insight into much more than Hoveyda's life including: the incompetent regime of the Shah, the causes of the 1979 revolution, and the barbarism of the revolutionary period.A great read"
5,I was blown away by how much I enjoyed this book.,"I found this book to be very fascinating, fair, and extremely well written. Like other readers (below), it was hard for me to put the book down once I started reading it. Through the life of Prime Minister Hoveyda, we learn how and why the Iranian Revolution succeeded and understand the reign of terror that followed the collapse of the Iranian Monarchy in 1979. I must say I did not expect an easy read when I purchased the book as I had read Dr. Milani's ""Lost Wisdom: Rethinking Modernity in Iran"" and found the book to be fascinating but truly academic in language and tone. Simply put, this is a very readable book and I was blown away by how much I enjoyed it. Wonderful writing!"
3,Better off having lights tinted,Bought these for my 04 black expedition because I didn't want to tint the tailights because I need the visibility in the winter months for work. When I test fit the covers they didn't quite cover the whole tail light but I figured once I permenantly installed them it would look better. I was wrong and they did not cover the whole light and there are areas of red on both sides of the light. They attach with velcro which I was not too thrilled with either but I do like the fact that they are easily removable. All in all I would just have them tinted instead of using these since they are not a good fit.
3,A PI reader from Nova Scotia,"While I enjoyed Knief's previous two John Caine books, I really can't get too exited about this one. The plot has a number of holes in it, particularly the relationship between Chawlie and Margo,and why Caine would want to get involved with this conniving,bossy woman is anybodies guess. Still, there's a lot of action and good use of local color. We could probably do without Caine's talking to that voice in his head all the time, and if you,re going to use the names of real historical people,get it right. The Secretary of the Navy under Truman, who killed himself, was not Vincent Forrestal, it was James Forrestal."
5,cacharel for men - sexy,"The first time I smelled this fragrance on a male client of mine, I almost attacked him, it had such an effect on me. After asking him what it was, I actually bought a bottle and started wearing it myself, then felt so guilty I went back to my Shalimar. A few years later, I met my soul-mate, and yep, the first thing I bought him was Cacharel! 17 years of bliss later, he still wears it, and it still drives me crazy. I use a lot of lavendar in my house, and since this has a smoky lavendar base, that's probably why I was drawn to it. It's like no other masculine fragrance. Enjoy!"
3,"Nice Fragance, but it doesn't last long.","Nice sweet and spice fragrance, but it only last about 1 hr after spraying a quite good amount of it."
2,Disappointed!,"So here is how it all started. I had this fragrance years ago, and I wanted to change it but I found that it is still my favorite. I bought the fragrance and was really excited to smell it again. Well, I was really disappointed with the smell, it smelled different, plus my friend cannot smell it unless I kind of pour it all over my cloth!I was getting another one for my dad, but I believe I should always smell the fragrance and how strong it is before buying it. I think you cannot get these kinds of things over the internet. Who knows!"
5,Excellent and Thorough,"I'm going to the Canadian Rockies for my honeymoon, and I couldn't ask for a better guide. The author includes every detail one could want. I'm looking forward to using it on the trip. I can tell I've chosen the right place, because the author himself has chosen to live there!"
2,Harmonic Balancer under tolerances,"I placed an order for this balancer for my car, I really needed the part as soon as possible. I placed my order and paid for next day delivery, I received my part 48 hours later (two days). As soon as the part arrived I opened the box and compared the part against the original balancer from my car, the timing marks were fine and I decided to install the balancer using the tool that I have to hold the balancer for torquing (I have used this tool before with no problems). The hexagon in the balancer it is TOO SMALL for the tool I have, I needed to make some modifications to my tool to install the balancer.I will never buy these kind of parts from this manufacturer."
1,A hodgepodge of pseudo-science thought,"I recently moved and when I did found Lightpath, previously unread, as I was unpacking. Since neither my phone nor my cable were hooked up yet so I started reading this book. I was amazed at how poorly the author manages characterization and kept waiting for the real ""meat"" of the book. I reached the end without finding out what the book was really about except a paycheck for the writer.The silliness of most of characters emotional and sewual interactions and the Barbie doll descriptions of most of the women -- even the ""smart ones"" -- makes me wish that this writer was more in touch with the real world and less inclined toward sophomoric philosophy.I understand this guy writes short stories -- and he probably had 4 or 5 good short story ideas in this book. But he should never have made a novel of this length out of those ideas. To recover from Lightpath I re-read Pride of Chanur the nexy day."
1,You would be better off to read most anything else,"I bought this book because I was in Switzerland and it was in a bargain bin for 1/4 the price of your usual English paperback. I'm not at all sure how I managed to finish it, in that it seemed terrible in every possible way: I found the characters artificial and a lot of their actions and dialogue terribly contrived. For example, what sysadmin would allow an unknown computer to freely interface with her system, which is the main computer controlling all aspects of a space station? At several points the characters seemed to be simply giving speeches of the author's own views. Better novels about utopia and man's interfaction with computers abound."
2,Not very engaging,"The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it had a couple cool ideas and I like the book cover design.Some interesting ideas but the author spent the whole novel explaining things to the reader. As soon as there was some plot twist or mystery the authorhad another charecter call up an explain how they figured out what was going wrong. None of the Charecters seemed very realistic. The main ""plot"" of the book was only indirectly dealt with by any of the main charecters. And then when some of the main charecters stood face to face with the ""problem"" at the climax of the book the ""problem"" basically explained what was going on and then solved itself. And to think I continued reading it to the end."
2,Boring,Perhaps this book was a little heavy on philosophy and light on the story-line. Fairly good character development. I prefer a more engaging writing style. I'd spend my money on Gibson's Idoru first.
3,Trashy self centered unfulfilled women stumble through life.,"These are unhappy, ego driven unsatisfyed women. Very sad and morbid lives. Mallory is selfish and is pathetic, our other ""hero"" leads an equally disfunctional life. This is a manipulative writer trying to cash in on the trendy 90's speak."
2,How 90's can you get?,"Come on now, this a minipulative text, trying very hard to be fashionable, give me a break. Why not try a real writer and get some depth. Do you really care about Mallory? This is not great literature, don't fall into the publicity trap of hired PR's."
1,Disjointed and disappointing,"A big fan of historical fiction with strong female protagonists, I had big hopes for this book when I stumbled across it on a library shelf. But the style was simply too jarring - it didn't transition from the various vantage points well. None of the characters garnered my sympathy, because they just didn't emerge as ""real"" to me. I abandoned the book about halfway, skimming through in a quest for improvement. I didn't find it."
1,HIgh Expectations Disappointed,"The premise of this book is excellent; unfortunately, the novel needed better editing, both in content and in style: at one crucial point, a villain-type is described as being down on ""all fours,"" with his hands behind his back -- that impossible position makes the rest of this very important scene unbelievable. Also, better editing would have corrected such obvious and disappointing errors as the constant misspelling of ""all right"" and the erroneous use of the past tense form of the verb ""lie."" I was so looking forward to this book, but I couldn't finish it."
1,"Cheers to the reviewer from Boston, June 7th",I was going to write a review but the Boston reviewer did a perfect job ! My feeling exactly!
3,Hidden 80ies Fantasy Gem,"This historical fantasy-retelling was made in the fantasyboom of the eighties (just as Conan or Excalibur). But then it owes more to arthouse cinema with long, scarce shots concentrating on the beautiful irish landscape and the two quite exceptional leads (Waltz later went on to win an oscar - this one was his first role - still in his teens). There are three things going for it: strong acting, beautiful photography and a truly great syntheziser-score in the vein of Tangerine Dream. There are some things against it: It's very early eighties (which means slow-moving and brooding) and it's not really faithful to the tristan-legend.The movie was not successful and quickly forgotten. Here it is on a decent (not perfect, but good) DVD.For everyone in to Waltz and early 80ies Fantasy.And what a soundtrack."
3,Useful for the beginner!,"If you know how to scrapbook pretty well and experienced, then you really don't need this book, but it's great for the beginner in me. I understand how to do the simple stuff and really get a understanding in how scrapbooks should look versus how I just cut and paste. My girlfriend who is another Martha Stewart didnt find this useful.Useful!"
4,good book,"This book provides great ideas for a beginner, I really like this book. When I'm stuck I can just flip through the book and find some good inspirations. I also picked up several new techniques that I didn't know before. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who is just picking up scrapbooking."
2,300 pages of boring,"I recently purchaced this book, and i was very disappointed. I have some of the other Creating Keepsakes books, such as the ""Scrapbooks tips"" and ""Scrapbooking Family heritage"" (I'd give all of them 5 stars). But, the Creating Keepsakes Encyclopedia has half the images and examples as the other books. After about 1/2 an hour of reading through it I was done for good; whereas with the other books every time I open them I see something new that I didn't notice before. I was extremely disappointed with this book. I would not recommend it to anyone. And it shouldn't be called an ""encyclopedia""-it only explains the MOST BASIC of scrapbooking techniques. I mean, it takes 4 pages just to show you how to tear paper!!! PLEASE don't waist your money on this-instead, try some of the other ""Creating Keepsakes"" books. This one is the worst of the bunch. All the other ""Keepsakes"" books I own or have read are terrific."
5,Answers All Your Questions!,"I've been scrapbooking for a few years. There are several things I've wanted to try, but didn't know where to start.This book has answered all of my questions and then some. It does so in straight forward answers, in many cases with step-by-step pictures. They have lots of page ideas with ""how it was done"" text so you know just what to do.Excellent and would recommend to all levels of ability."
5,Great ideas for scrappers!,Lots of creative ideas and well detailed instruciton. A must have for your collection.
5,Great Book,"I love to scrapbook, even though I have only been doing it for about 6 months. This book is a perfect guide. I often find myself looking in the index to find ideas and examples for using embelishments. Even for a more experienced scrapbooker this book has many tips you might find useful. If for any reason I can't find what I need in this book (which is very rare), I can always go to on of the many websites listed in the resoures section in the back of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to scrapbook."
3,Perfect for a beginner,"This is a great book if you're new to scrapbooking. All the basic tools and techniques are explained, you'll also get to know the scrapbook lingo. The layouts are great and sure to inspire. However once you get past the beginner stage there's not much for you in this book. This book does not go too deep in the techniques and the layouts get lost between two page explanations on how to use a paper trimmer."
3,Not as many ideas as I would like,"I don't think I am creative enough for this book. I wanted a book that would give me more hands-on, how-to for putting together my scrapbook. I think that they look so nice when I have seen what other people have done and I was looking for a book that would walk me through it. This book tells you all about it and shows what other people have done, but not enough step by step. There is a lot of information about all of the tools, gadgets available for scrapbooking, but not how to start your project and what things to consider when you put it all together. This may be perfect for other people, but I need more help with the basics of laying it out and how to get to the final result."
2,Glaring errors detract from the info in this book.,"This book's glaring errors(saying that Muslims only pray 3 times a day,etc.)(Muslims must say them 5 times a day,according to Hadith) hurt this book. False assumptions(Sunnism is devoid of warmth, women's emancipation means ""emancipating"" them from the Sharia(Divine Law)run throughout this book.Love and emotional feeling for Allah and the Prophet(saws)are at the root of Sharia:this is what compells people to submit their wills to Allah.The only way women's due rights(the ones in Qu'ran and Hadith) can be guranteed is through Allah's Law(Sharia). Interesting information that this book gives us on recent and previous "" Islamic Fundamentalist"" governments and groups is the highlight of this book. If you're looking for this kind of information and not an Islamically correct view, then I'd recomend this book,if you can't find many books with both."
2,Not bad if you don't have other books to read,"Compared to other authors of the same genre, most of this book is quite far-fetched and unbelievable. This is the only Rollins book I have read to date, so maybe I am putting unfair judgment upon his writing, but I was not able to develop a bond with any of the characters or really get into the story. While the story itself was intriguing, some of the other plot points I found to be too ""out there"" compared to the rest of the book. I can believe in a lost, sunken city that existed thousands of years ago and I can believe many of the other archeological aspects, but the turning back time thing didn't sit well in my stomach. But if you're bored on a Saturday, it's an easy read for a day. If you like this book, then you'll love Clive Cussler. He writes along the same level, but with a more realistic and historical appeal, plus his characters are more appealing and you become attached to them."
5,DEEP into the heart of an ancient mystery,"I loved this book. It combines world tensions, ancient mythology, lost worlds, cutting edge science, while maintaing a pace that kept the pages turning all night long. I want more!"
3,"good story, mediocre writing","I found this book to be engaging, but in spite of the fact that the story had some great elements I wasn't really impressed with Rollins' writing. He's not quite a Clive Cussler, although he seems very much to want to be."
5,WONDERFUL!!,"Deep Fathom was the best story I've read all year! What really facinated me was that the places are real places, and RongoRongo is an actual language found in the places noted in the book. I'm a very picky reader, but Rollins current book puts him in the same category as Cook and Koontz. This book will capture, and keep, your attention throughout. I'm thrilled to hear that Rollins has taken the year off to work on his next book, and I can't wait to read it--so WRITE FAST, JIM!!"
5,A thriller with non-stop action,"Wow, This was a great action book with plenty of mystery. I have read all three of James Rollins books and I consider him in the same category of Koontz, Crichton and Cussler. The story was easy to follow yet hard to predict. It's one of those books that anyone who likes a good mystery or thriller will enjoy. It even gave up a look at what happens when you unlease the dogs of war. I hope someone considers making a movie out of this story. I will buy the first ticket."
3,Nice story but gets facts wrong again,"Good book, but whenever Rollins writes about Alaska he always gets his facts wrong. A trip to Alaska would do him a lot of good.1. There are no Inuit in the Aleutians. Only Aleuts who are not related to the Inuit.2. There are no trees on the Aleutian islands, black spruce or otherwise.3. There are no totem poles in the Aleautians because there are no trees and the Aleut have no tradition for carving such things (or the Inuit for that matter).4. There are no bluffs or hills in the Aleutians that would allow you to see the entire strech of the islands. The Aleutians are so long they go beyond the curvature of the earth.5. Having an Aleut with a dog named Nanook is strange since that is an Inuit word meaning polar bear. Unlikely.At least he put a lot of effort into his facts about the Polynesian islands."
3,"This is a stretch, even for an avid Sci-Fi reader","I like Science Fiction, specifically space opera and future tech stuff. Unfortunately, I felt that the storyline behind this book was a bit far fetched, even for me.The big differnce I'm sure is that the far future sci-fi is so far in advance, that we cannot gainsay what the author has thought up. Furthermore, when an author starts writing quasi sci-fi that changes some of our preconcieved notions of science, it can still be believable and enjoyable, if there are some grains of realism behind them.However, to try and change the powerplant of the earth (i.e. the electro-magnetic field) from the liquid core to this just didn't really fly with me.Now, don't get me wrong, James Rollins can create characters in his book almost on par with the great one, David Weber. The majority of the characters in this book were very well developed and did the things they should have done.All in all, not a bad book, but not his best either."
1,Terrible. Dreck.,"Unlike most, I found Excavation to be much better than Deep Fathom. Rollins' strengths are in plot twists, engaging premises, and strong, stock characters. Unfortunately, he leaves all of this on the surface for Deep Fathom.In all honesty, I did not finish the book. I couldn't. It was simply too awful. Too many details rang untrue. Many of the stories premises were beyond the scope of believability. The characters were uninteresting, and the tensions between the characters was simply laughable. You can enjoy a book for what it is, but only if it is true to itself. This book came up empty on all counts.I have no problem with suspending disbelief. However, a book of this caliber has me running, not walking, back to better crafted novels."
2,Too much make believe,"This is the second book of Rollins that I have read, I was hoping that it would be better then the first one, ""Amazonia"". I was wrong, follows same style, too much science fiction. The books are well written, and have some interesting parts that keep you interested, but the story line just gets too sci fi for my taste. I was given multiple Rollins books for Christmas, hopefully one will be a winner."
2,A fairy tale,"Definitively this book is a very bad fairy tale. For instance: The prologue has three chapters and the only one that matters is the Air Force One's chapter. So you can skip the other two chapters as well as the epilogue.Once you just skip those three chapters, the book goes fast paced until the persecutions began. How many persecutions can you read in a book? So to keep this review short. After the third persecution you'll start to bore of reading.But the book's finish is utterly preposterous. I don't know if there is or not a lost world -myself wrote a book about that- but traveling in time is just distraught."
5,Great entertainment!,"I bought this book solely because it was written by James Rollins, and I remembered how very much I had enjoyed his previous book, Subterranean. I must admit I found this to be another action-packed thriller which entertained me thoroughly. It's a near future almost science fiction tale that somehow comes off as entirely believable while you're reading it. If you like high-paced adventure at its best, this book will not disappoint you. It started out just a bit slow, but after a few chapters I was enthralled by the story and remained on the edge of my seat throughout the book. The ending was spectacular! So often, authors fail to tie up loose ends or I am unhappy with the ending situation, but in this case, the ending was as satisfying as the rest of the story."
3,"Good, but not great","This is my second James Rollins book. The first was ""Subterranean"" which I thought was much better. ""Deep Fathom"" was interesting, but seemed to drag in places. It had an ""Indiana Jones"" feel to it since the characters could get out of any situation unharmed. Mr. Rollins seems to knowledgeable about his subject matter and the descriptions of the scientific phenomenon that appear in the story are interesting. It is difficult to pin down, but for some reason this story just did not move along as well as did ""Subterranean"". I have not yet read ""Excavation"" but plan to soon."
5,Excellent Rollins novel,Another excellent Rollins novel. Having read most of the Rollins newer workwent to this early novel and was happilly surprised by it. Very interestingpremise and fast paced thriller.
2,Way too much going on,"Hold on to your hats, Mr. Rollins finds more ways to spin your head around than any book I have ever read.We find dark matter, bad presidents, volcanoes, ancient societies, lost loves. Way too much going on here."
2,not all that impressive,"I have read previous Rollins books and thought they were really good, so I bought this one thinking it would be as good as the others. I was wrong. This book is too deeply involved in science and history. There were a few really good action parts and a few cool murders but besides that it was mostly boring. so if you like really fast-paced, action packed, suspense filled, adrenaline rush books check out Amazonia, but in my opnion skip over this one."
1,boring beyond belief,"I am a huge Rollins fan and i am eagerly awaiting his new book to hit at the end of June,I knew this was a reprint from 10 years ago and it shows.His writing and stories have gotten much better,sadly though this book is so freaking predictable it's like one of those movies you see on sci-fi tv octo-shark vs lobster man.I usually plow through his books and get mad when i'm done because they ended.Not here though I am skimming and skimming waiting,waiting and still waiting for it to kick into high gear sadly there isn't one.I just threw it across the room and gave up if you don't have me by the 300th page then i'm done.."
2,Deep Fathom,"This book attracted my attention so vividly at first due to my personal experience in Japan on 3.11.However as I went on , the story turns too unreal just like a fairy tale.That's why I gave this book only two stars."
3,Strange Ending!,Typical Rollins book but the ending was really strange! I had to push myself to finish because the ending was so outlandish.
3,Not up to His Earlier Works,"Rollins is a great writer of pulpy action-adventure books. But this entry was not quite up to the standard of Excavation and Subterranean.Here Rollins is shooting for larger scale, including a variety of apocalyptic scenarios. His cast of characters is once again diverse and diverting, and he keeps the action cliping right along. But where the other works tied everything up neatly at the end, this book loses its grip in the final act.In the end, the centerpiece of the book is a Mysterious Something which is never really defined or explained, and which happens to do just the right thing at the climactic moment for no readily apparent reason. This little Deux Ex Spacerock finale annoyed this reader immensely."
1,Reader warning,"Iam a fan of Rollins' work but I feel duped with the release of this hardback. We should have been told it was a reprint of a past book that was already in paperback. Wasted money. I read so many books that it wasn't until I was in a few pages that it all came back. PLEASE check your author libraries before buying because you WILL NOT be told. Live and learn, but keep reading."
1,good idea--very poorly executed.,"I recvd this book with great enthusiasm expecting a highly enjoyablesci-fi/techno thriller.what I got was a script for one of those network TV or Sci-Fi channelmade for TV disaster ""epics"". (you know--the ones with Kim Delaney asthe bainy and beautiful scientist--perhaps Thomas Gibson as the stalwartex-military reluctant hero--and of course,the anagonist---an ex-militaryhit squad leader with a grudge against our hero--plus the evil,opportunistic politician)get the picture? this is the same recycled plot and people we have all seen dozens of times.the techno parts of this novel are simplistic and condecending.in short,my friends---you can do much better.if Mr Rollinsis taking suggestions--allow me to remind him that if he wants to writea 3-4 hour television show--please be my guest.the dwindling number of us folks that enjoy a good novel expect and desrve some thought and somedepth. this book has very little of either."
1,Uggh.,"Sorry folks: cornball dialogue, tired old SF elements, and a cop out, made-for-TV ending. Unredeemable."
1,pass........,"I have read and enjoyed a few of James Rollin's other books, so I was really looking forward to this one.I literally had to drag myself through it! I kick myself for not just giving up on it, this is not a book thatflows at all, it is like riding a wooden roller coaster up the clanky track! I prefer my books to be like theride down, smooth with well executed turns and surprises. This was not. There are many other booksout there, take a pass on this one. Two on my reading list; The Breach by Patrick Lee, and BeneathDark Ice by Greig Beck."
5,one of the worlds best writers.,I have read this book before. It was so good I saved it and reread it again. It was even better this time.
4,Another great adventure from Rollins,"This is another great adventure from James Rollins, who's the Jules Verne of our days. Full of action, it is a non-stop, chapter after a chapter adventure tale. Natural catastrophes occur one after another, bringing the world on a brink of destruction and nuclear threat. The secret lies at the deep bottom of the ocean, left by ancient civilization and if it isn't solved, world will cease to exist. Very well written."
3,Great 440 pages! Awful last 10.,What is with the ending? I don't want to ruin it for anyone that hasn't read it but...awful ending! I did give it three stars though mostly for the very creative history of this missing contineint of peole. I really enjoyed his first two books and was enjoying this one until the last 10 pages. Read it for the imagination the author put into a lost civilization just be sure to have a grip ball or something to take your frustrations out on when you get to the dreaded...What day is it????
2,Promising start-ridiculous finish.,"I picked this book out of desperation for something to entertain me while on vacation. The book did not grab my attention at first, but at least the premise sounded plausible. However, as the plot unfolded, it grew more outlandish by the page. Mr. Rollins clearly does not have a good grasp of technology and science and therefore should refrain from writing about those topics. He is no Michael Crichton. He falls back on the lazy plot device of a supercomputer with artificial intelligence to fill gaps in his story. It is so convenient to ask the computer to do any task or find any information much like snapping your fingers or rubbing Aladdin's lamp. The climax was just plain dumb and made me angry. Skip this stinker."
4,Good Adventure!,This is a good adventure. Drags a bit in the middle but if one wants to read something fairly light this is as good as any.
4,Another excellent novel by Mr. Rollins,"While similar in nature to his two previous novels (Subterranean and Excavation), Deep Fathom is still an easy and entertaining read. While all his novels require the reader to suspend some belief, he does provide ample reasoning to support the events occurring. I won't go into details to avoid spoiling any of the plot for future readers.All his books have a little Cussler (adventure), Ludlum (espionage) and James Bond (hero avoids being killed). Of his three books published in paperback, this one is the best of the three. All grip the reader from the start (eclipse, earthquakes, etc. in this one) and don't let go until the end. The major knock on this one, and a reason I gave it four stars instead of five, was the somewhat ""hokey"" resolution at the end/prologue. Aside from that, this is a excellent novel to fill some hours of reading time."
5,LOVE JAMES ROLLINS,"Another great book by James Rollins!!! What can I say, he is one of the best suspense,thriller and mystery writer. LOVE ALL HIS BOOKS!!!"
4,Italian American,I found this an extremely insightful look at what Italian Americans experienced while growing up in this country. It brought back memories of stories I heard or things I experienced while growing up.
2,Received a Library Book,"The price for this book was great, it was inexpensive, but I was surprised when I did receive the book, to find it was a library book. The book is not written as well as I hoped, and the condition of the book was average. I guess you get what you pay for..."
1,Photoflex on camera soft box,I cannot in good faith recommend this item. The quality is at best marginal. The construction of the seams is just sub-standard quality.
5,Great Music from a Great Movie,"I was given this thing for my birthday, and have loved every minute of it. I loved the film, and the music is great. The only qualm about this disc is that it isn't in the order that it was in the movie, but who cares??? I liked it just fine. A great buy. Definitely worth it."
5,This book strengthens the soul and spirit.,"There is a heartfelt need among women and girls to celebrate women's history. In her outstanding work, Katherine Martin has put before us a diverse group of role models from which every woman can learn and be proud."
1,Women of Courage?,"WAH, WAH, WAAAAAAHHHHHH! A bunch of whiney little babies. These women weren't courageous in my view. They were in situations that they had ""no choice"", so sure you're going to do what sounds courageous.And the stories were incredibly boring. How in the name of all things good did this woman get published? What a piece of crap!And Amazon is making me choose at least one star. SERIOUSLY? It deserves none!"
1,Doesn't Exist,I never received this product and therefore have nothing to say about it. Some sort of inventory mix-up and now the product seems to be unavailable.
2,Missing Pages from the Glossary,"I enjoyed reading the first chapter but I soon discovered two pages missing from the glossary. Ordered another copy, same issue discovered with missing pages from the glossary. Disappointed."
5,Fantastic cake baking!!!,"This book was first lent to me and now after a few weeks in my possession, I've realized I can't let it go. Of course I'm buying it before I Give the original owner back his.The recipes describe over 200 recipes including Chocolate cakes, Meringues, tray bakes, cheesecakes, scones biscuits and shortbreads and on and on..In this 2003 edition all measurements are both in British and American units making every recipe accessible to anyone.This is definitely a MUST BUY baking cookbook."
3,Appealing recipes with a fault,"First of all, I have to admit I have yet to try my hand at any recipes. Let me say, though, that there are beautiful color pictures and delicious sounding recipes that appear to be of a medium to hard difficulty. Any accomplished baker would likely achieve delicious results. Unappealing is the fact that all recipes are measured in ounces being that the author and book are both British, which either require a scale, which not every home baker might own, or neccesitating conversion of weights to what is commonly used in the United States. All in all, I love any kind of baking book, so I'm still extremely happy to add this book to my collection."
1,Sizing was COMPLETELY wrong!!!,"I researched this and another harness on the company's website before purchasing here. The site stated that the xxs size would fit a dog 2-5 lbs. My dog is around 3 lbs, and both of the harnesses are way too big. There is no way that it fits the smaller end of the weight range. I was excited to find something that would supposedly fit my small dog, but I'm left without a harness that fits properly. I'm very unhappy with this item. Do not purchase products from this company because their sizing is completely inaccurate."
2,Maybe I've Been Unlucky ...,"... but I have purchased two of these from this seller. The cane part works fine, but one to all the lights stop working before too very long at all. If my wife wanted just a cane, I would get her just a cane."
5,A Great Magazine,This is a great magazine that gives the reader great ideas in the workings of a small farm or ranch. A very good overall go-to publication to learn new skills and ideas about what works and what doesn't.
1,GARBAGE!!!!,"I had the grave misfortune of picking up a copy of Larry Quirk's ""book"" on Bob Hope a few days ago, and was simply blown away by the amount of garbage I've suddenly digested. Coming away from this book I wondered did Bob Hope really hated homosexuals, or is this volume truly about a homosexual author (Quirk) who just simply hates his subject because he made gay jokes---in the 1940's? Hack is too good of a description for Quirk.... sleaze bucket sounds just about right.....This book has been returned-----AVOID"
1,No thanks for these memories,"A book promising the ""real story"" of Bob Hope's rise from struggling vaudevillian to American comedy icon has a great deal to offer, but Lawrence Quirk's book fails to deliver on that promise. Among other things, the book is badly written as the author repeatedly goes off on tangents; One moment we're with Bob on Broadway, and then we're suddenly on the set of one of the ""Road"" pictures. Quirk seems to have an agenda with regard to sexual interests, suggesting that many stars thought to be completely heterosexual were, perhaps, not. However, these claims are attributed to no one and seem to be tossed in on a whim. A badly edited book (typos and contradictions about) I can think of nothing to recommend The Road Well-Traveled. I await the publication of a definitive Hope bio. I suspect that will come following the passing of the legendary comedian"
1,Bad as others have said,"This book is truly as bad as others have said. If you want a worse one, try Quirk's book about James Stewart -- long on innuendo, but no proof."
2,A Biography or a Gossip Column?,"This book seemed to have nothing to do with the life of Bob Hope. Quirk seems to have choosen a star who was connected to many people and then dug up every piece of gossip possible on them. The book has all of the bad things about Hope, the people surrounding Hope and the way Hope lived his life. Nothing is less satisfying than spending your money on a biography and getting a gossip column about stars and producers sexual preferences, which is probably the things most promintently described throughout the whole book. If you want to get the real, true biography about Bob Hope, by the A&E video biography, legions better."
2,Not very bright,"It is not as bright as I thought the original bulb was. I don't have a reference as to the brightness, but, I won't buy another one like this in the future."
4,impressed,the booklet was small simple & informative... what more do you need.. oh yeah just to put it into practice. we are working on that have noticed a difference in under 2 weeks just needs committment!
5,It really works!,I followed the recommended program and really saw results in my thighs. I did not do it every single day but when I did exercise I did all of the thigh sets. After the first time you exercise you may feel sore but you most likely won't feel any of this until the next day. Once you get used to it... it won't be that bad. If you are consistent and willing to put in the effort- you will get results.
3,This is NOT a joke review,"Thank goodness for freedom of opinion!All that I can say is despite what you may see to the contrary, I found this to be a pretty good album. By no means great, but pretty good. Stand out tracks include the title cut ""Former Child Actor"" co-written by Rick Springfield, and Feldman's cover of ""Imagine"".I can appreciate how many people do not like the album, and I imagine that these people are likely not fans of Feldman himself, but do feel that it may be getting unnecessarily bashed on this forum.Anyway, I liked the album, and actually have it converted to mp3 where I can carry it around on my phone whenever I need to."
3,Just for fun,"I bought this as a joke for my girlfriend. We laughed at how horrible it was. Seriously, bad bad stuff. Anyway, I had it in the car changer and the music was turned down and we were talking. We both started to get angry until we finally realized it was because this tripe on a silver disc was playing. Thanks for the laugh Corey. Watched Lost Boys last night, you'll always be a Frog brother to me."
1,A potent diatribe in the manacle of life,"The best metaphor to describe Mr. feldmans work is cheese, this is the worst thing that has ever been commited to any recorded media....Please somebody rip my ears off so that I don't have to suffer anymore......."
1,Are you kidding?,"I really wanted this to not suck.I would like this poor guy to suceed.Honestly though, how did this get released?This is so bad I dont know how anyone involved could not have said at least something.It is that bad.If this is not the worst CD I have every had the misfornunate opportunity to listen to, then I forgot something that should have personally scarred me. I know this album did.They make you pick at least one star. Sorry...it would not get any."
1,Make it stop!,"Anytime a washed-up celebrity tries to grab the spotlight again with a music ""album"" (and I use that term loosely), it inevitably results in disaster. This is no exception. What hubris it must take to put out crap like this.Oh, and quote: ""Corey's legendary acting ability has been well known for years."" Corey - is that you?"
1,I am kind to give this 1 star !,"The ""wanna be"" cannot sing! The production is cheap and the cover art work appears to have been produced by a cheap knock off artist.People, this is the winner of the worst CD of the ALL TIME. You know that a CD must be HORRIBLE when AMAZON believe it best not to place sound bites on their site to assist in promoting sales for this CD. This CD would be the perfect tool to use as a weapon to torture criminals."
3,THIS IS AWESOME,THIS IS ICP'S WORST JOKER'S CARD BUT IT'S EXTREMLY GOOD! ITS SO AWESOME THIS IS A MUST GET FOR ALL THE JUGGALOS OUT THERE! 2 WORDS BUY IT!
5,It's the shxt plain and simple,"I think that CARNIVAL OF CARANGE is better then RINGMASTER and RIDDLE BOX(don't get me wrong those joker cards are still da shxt).It's tied with GREAT MILENKO and THE AMAZING JECKEL BROTHERS. The best thing about it is all the song are pure rap! Cause ya know ICP likes to mix rockin roll in a few songs.Every song on here is da bomb my favorite is REBEL FLAG. so go out and buy it, it's well worth the money for eny juggalo or somebody who loves rap! STAY DOWN WIT DA CLOWN 4 LIFE JUGGALOS!"
3,It's OK!,"The first Joker's Card. If you didn't start with this one, you may be dissapointed. It's a lot shorter than the other albums, and that Dark Carnival ambience hasn't quite made it's way into the music yet. Most of the stuff is performed by Violent J, who sounds somehow different on this one. It does have some good songs though. ""The Juggla"" is the best, and contains a Prince sample. ""Red Neck Hoe"" is pretty funny. Overall this isn't a bad CD. But not nearly as great as Riddle Box or Amazing Jeckyll Brothers. You should get this one after you've gotten the others."
3,The Beginning of all things to end,This is a really good cd. It is the beginning of all things to end. The first jokers card brings forth the messages that the ICP tells us.
1,ICP SUCKS!,"ok, these guys, CANNOT rap, they are pathetic, if you wanna hear some real rap, listen to some 2pac, or to for those of u who are inclined to do some research to find good music, look into like underground stuff. but this is just seriously trash."
1,there is far better in this medium to listen to,"There are far too many young people listening to this music who have not already heard the prerequisite James Brown's Funky People vol 1, 2. Public Enemy. Souls of Mischief. Pharcyde. DeLaSoul. Tribe Called Quest. Eric B and Rakim. DJ Red Alert. Wu-Tang Clan. Search Amazon for one of these other artists and buy a record from black rap artists and not white boys (apologies to Beastie Boys and 3rd Bass). Then there are Funk essentials also: Isaac Hayes. Curtis Mayfield. Barry White. mid 70s Marvin Gaye Temptations. Bootsy Collins. George Clinton. Funkadelic. Ohio Players. and more. Please do not buy any ICP records until you know the roots of the medium that they are trying to ""Pat Boone."""
1,Carnivale of SHIT,just some more white boys who can't rap any plenty of white fansto buy there albums
3,"ICP's First Album, But Not Their Best...","While this cd does contain some classic cuts, it's just not up to par with nearly all of the releases that follow this. Having said that, this is still a good debut that shows some promise. I mean you have to take into account that ICP had a very limited budget and limited studio technology. If you're a juggalo, then you already have this (or you should!). If you're an ICP fan who is more into rock/metal aspect of ICP and music in general (like most of ICP's fan base, then be forewarned that this cd was made before ICP starting introducing rock elements into their music. Since i'm a completist(and a big ICP fan), this is a must own.Top Cuts:Carnival of CarnageThe JugglaWizard of The HoodGuts on The Ceiling"
4,theier debut,this is thier first album.it was cheaply recorded and doesnt have a lot of the cool background noises like the other album for atmosphere.the songs i liked best were wizard of the hood which was a wizard of oz type story only very vulgar and told from a ghetto point of view.there was also guts on the ceiling about a guy who is blown up but lives and goes around town trying to piece himself back together.they have a racist song called your rebel flag also.
5,1 of ICPs best albums,This album is probably ICPs best albums other than there stuff they made before it. The 2 best songs on here are Wizard of The Hood and Is That You. By far the best joker card album. All of ICPs stuff is really good I don't care what people say about there newer stuff it is still good. Another album I should suggest is The Amazing Jeckel Brothers. So buy this album if you really want to it is really good
3,Not ICP's Best,"Not their best. The production is kinda crappy, but i understand that. Buy this albumFinal thought: Buy this album"
4,wickedness rating,i like to rate each joker card by how wicked it is.1 coc: dont have it yet2 ring master: very very wicked3 riddle box: pretty dam wicked4 great melinko: its wicked5 amazing jeckel brothers:pretty wicked6 shangrila:fairly wickedhells pit: very wicked
1,This album stinks,"I expected waaaaay more from this album, but once I got it i wanted to puke. It sucked so badly that I stopped listening to it all together. I hate every song. Espeacially ""first day out"" and ""Is that you?"" These songs are a disgrace to rap.Insane Clown Posse made the worst rap cd ever."
3,where's all 15 songs?!?!?,"although i have two versions(old 15 song and remastered 13 song), it is a disappointment that two tracks were taken off. two good tracks: night of the axe and blackin your eyes.if you can get the 15 track version, GET IT!! if you can only get the 13 track version, you're outta luck!!!!"
5,ICP Classic,This is ICPs first album as the Insane Clown Posse and one of there best. In this cd they go back to the old school rap and tear it up. This album is truly horrorcore as ICP should stay. None of those guitar riffs will be found on this cd. Jus pure ICP during their early years. A must buy for any juggalo!
5,THE GREATEST JOKER'S CARD OF ALL!!!,"If you wanna be down with ICP, this is the album to buy. It is the absolute wickedest, freshest, phattest shxt ICP has put out! The best songs are the hilarious ""First Day Out"", the wicked ""Psychopathic"", and the bass-boomin' ""Never Had It Made"". Bottom line is, if you don't have this album, you're a bxtch!!!"
5,Wicked!!!!!,"It's hard for me to ""rank"" the ICP CD's, because they're all so different and have a distinct sound. I don't like this one as much as the other 3 Joker's cards, but it deserves better than 4 stars. I still love it, because rather than crazy clowns, they sound like really ""bad"" white boys. The hardcore gangsta rap sound is cool. Never Had It Made is as good as ICP gets. Check it out!!!!!"
3,ok,icp is ok but they swear too much.It has cool sounds and beats but they swear too much so it's not the best but it's still good
5,"Nabokov told her, ""You have very nice legs, my dear.""","I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir by one of the female pioneers in film and television. Joanna Lee (writer/director/producer/actress) has struggled against a male-dominated Hollywood for years and has never lost her sass, her style, or her stubborn determination to follow her passions. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the inner workings of the film/TV business, and particularly to any female aspiring to a career in Hollywood."
1,Astro Pneumatic 5820 Review,"An important decision, if you decide to replace a transverse engine's clutch, is what engine support to buy, since they are not readily available to rent. I recently used an Astro Pneumatic 5820 Engine Support, which was a huge mistake. The base of the AP5820 was slightly rounded and spiral-wrapped with cheesy nylon, to keep it from slipping. All of this made it somewhat unstable. New rubber feet had to be fashioned. Additionally, the cables provided were way too long to be useful. They had to be considerably shortened and re-looped, using a Fastenal 43383, 1/8"" x 5/8"", Aluminum Hour Glass Swage Sleeve. It takes a swage tool to properly crimp the sleeve--such a pain. A chain would have been so much better. To make matters worse, the middle support arm was shaky and had to be reinforced. Needless to say, this is not a professional piece of equipment, in my opinion. I realize not many people change their own clutches--this may help someone, however, avoid making a mistake."
3,O.K.,I purchased this support bar to remove the engine from a Ford Escape. It worked as advertised. I did put some rubber hose on the feet to lessen the likelihood of damage to the inner fender.
5,The demonstration of real power of STL,"I salute this author with his kind of patience to walk through the implementation of the tiny PIM with the STL and with very detail and clear explanation. He has started his plan well with the class diagrams. I have learnt and pickup a number of good programming techniques (as simple as the various way of string manipulation) from this book and going to try as many STL as possible in my project development using Borland Kylix 3 Professional (C++), GNU g++/gcc, Visual C++ Professional 6, Borland C++ 5.02 and Borland C++ Builder."
2,Not a celebration of our troops,"I read this book with great interest, having just finished Mike Jackson's exciting and inspirational Naked In Da Nang. This book also features Lt. Col. Jackson's story as well as his father's (Edmund Jackson served in World War II, hence the father/son connection). But I was terribly disppointed. Brave Men is disjointed and awkward and it seems to play to those who want to believe that veterans are semi-dysfunctional, given the horrific acts they experienced. Instead of humanizing our fighting men, Mr. Takiff's book seems hell-bent on showing only the grim and disturbing side of military service. While Jackson's book doesn't sugarcoat the realities of war, it maintains a very optimistic stance -- one that leaves the reader proud of our men in uniform, not concerned about sitting next to them on a bus!"
5,Sensitive and caring,"Michael Takiff clearly understands the men he interviewed and whose sagas he reports. He is sensitive to their manner of speech, their language and their feelings. I can't wait for his next book about Clinton!"
5,Profound Truth,"Heckler's introductory work on the ""embodied"" life. He explains the view of the human experience from the ancient wisdom of the profound connection of all things with the body. Describes how our relation to changes in our lives and to experiences with others may be made more meaningful through acknowledgement and understanding of how the body is the basis of all experience."
4,Vaughan Williams with some steel in its spine,"However much some of the other complete Vaughan Williams symphony cycles have to recommend them, I don't know that the composer would have cottoned to their tendency to either sentimentalize the music or play up its lyrical elements at the expense of sterner stuff. The late Bryden Thomson did neither, and the result is one of the most clear-eyed, tough-minded, and convincing VW cycles available--comparable to Adrian Boult's almost-complete 1950s series. Paradoxically, that sharp focus actually heightens the sense of mystery in passages such as the opening movement of the Eighth Symphony and the enigmatic final pages of the Sixth. Only ""A Sea Symphony"" is less than a total success, and even there the expansive final movement impresses. This 5-CD set omits the shorter works that served as makeweights in the individual issues, but Chandos has reissued some of those recordings elsewhere."
5,sweat sweat,this book is great. this book will give you some helpfull tips in between the chapters. they've got some of his worst injeries ever. this book is great i think everybodey to read this book
2,Beautiful (if unexceptional) rehash of the typical Authority plot,"This is a prime example of a title slowly descending into senility and decreptitude.In this ponderous storyline, the superhero team has to fend off an 'extinction-level' event while dealing with their personal/emotional/romantic entanglements. Essentially, it identical to every other post-Warren-Ellis Authority storyline.Ridley is a talented screenwriter, and this reads too much like a neatly-contained, solved-in-90-minutes blockbuster, and not enough like a continuation of one of the (formerly) best titles on the market.The art - Ben Oliver is terrific - has earned this book a place on my bookshelf, but otherwise, this would go straight back to the shop."
1,NOT WORTH THE $.,"This book is a bunch of one liners by 1001 different men. A few of the suggestions are intersting. The rest are nothing new. If you want a quick meaningless read, this is it."
1,This Book Is a COMPLETE Waste of Money!!,"This book was incredibly stupid and was a complete waste of money. It just lists 1001 things that some men find sexy, such as ""short hair"", and then another guy will say ""long hair is sexy"". The guys don't even agree on what is attractive and the book is just boring and dumb. I think the title of the book is decieving, and that it shold be called ""1001 things that random guys like about women"". Don't waste your money on this horrid book, go buy one that is actually useful, or at least amusing. My suggestion is The Guide to Getting It On by Goofy Foot Press. That book has everything you would want to know in it, from how to turn a man on (or a woman), protection, AIDS, keeping your sex life interesting, and tons more. ""1001 Sex Secrets Every Woman Should Know"" does not even deserve one star, but amazon wouldn't let me give 0."
4,straight from the mouths of men,"i found this book quite entertaining, reading it on a dark stormy night. i gave it four stars -maybe three-and-a-half - because it actually contains 1001 testimonials from 1001 men, telling you straight out what they'd like. i never will quite have 1001 lovers! of all ages, so nearly every page has a new suggestion from me."
5,Love this brush!,Best proffessional brush to use with blow dryer once your hair is about 75% dry for desired effect. Makes my hair smooth and straight with just a touch of under curl on the ends how I like it. Couldn't beat the price.
1,don't buy this hair brush!,"cheap quality, it seems made out of a soup can. the picture looks a lot better and you can confuse it with the same brand hair bush that has combined brissels (natural and plastic). Sadly, I couldn't return it because they did not send me paid return label, so if you decide to buy it don't go with this link."
3,"ok round brush, healthy though","I did expect more out of this round brush, but it is gentle on the hair. It will smooth it out . i purchased the jumbo 2.5 and a smaller one. The jumbo works to smooth hair out while blowdrying quicker and can handle more hair than the smaller sizes. They didnt add much volume like I hoped , but it is a good brush that will most likely keep hair healthy if you blow dry a lot."
2,False Advertisement,"i specifically ordered through this vendor because they offered a color i had not seen anywhere else. However, when the product arrived it was the original colors i could have ordered anywhere else for a lot less. False advertisement!!"
4,Very good quality,"This is a very good quality, light weight durable hairbrush perfect for getting my very curly hair straight and smooth! I have bought many of these type of styling brushes and they just do not last very long and are not as well made. I will be ordering other sizes very soon. The shipping from this seller was very fast and I am very happy with this product."
3,Barrel is good except where it meets the handle,"The barrel of the brush is nice, good bristles but where the barrel meets the handle seems to grab and pull on my hair. It's not a deal-breaker but it is kind of annoying. I have other Spornette brushes and haven't had this problem with others.Seller was prompt, no problems encountered."
3,Great brush,"This brush overall is wonderful, the only thing i have to say about it, is that while you are turning the brush (like you would to straighten your hair with a round brush)the hair gets cought in the handle, and it hurts :( I own many other branded round brushes, and this has never happened!!But overall it's light weight and easy to use."
4,Viewers Choice,"The movies are great,my reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the movies are stacked on top of each other in the case,we take care of our movies and this is a big no no."
1,not compatible with all manfrottos,This is not compatible with all manfrotto tripods. I recently purchased the 4 section CF 055cfpro4 tripod with the q90 system and thought this would be a neat way shed more weight. it doesn't fit and was able to confirm it with manfrotto. ah well.can't really rate it but forced to throw a star up for customer service on amazon.com and manfrotto's ends.
5,Good product,Another good product from Manfrotto. It allows me to take photos at ground level. It is plastic but it is very resistant.
4,Pun Filled Dog City doesn't disappoint!,"Dog City- a Henson classic. Full of puns and running gags (literally) if you are a Muppet/Henson fan you have got to get this show that has gone to the dogs! Hero Ace You (gesuntight) beats the bad guys, claims back his Uncle's Bar and wins the girl! Don't worry cat lovers, there is even one cat in this show. Would have given it 5 stars but it is too short! :)"
3,Good but no extra features,We have been looking forward to the release of this DVD for many years. I however am very disappointed that the DVD contains none of the extras that were part of the Jim Henson Hour television production. Items in that production that are not on the DVD are:1. The Jim Henson introduction.2. The Muppets skit.3. The two Bean Bunny skits.4. The making of Dog City skit.5. The Lee Majors skit take off on the Six Million Dollar Man.These were half the fun of Jim Henson Hour television show.
5,This is really awesome!,"This special is so dog-gone funny! I love it! I recomend it to anyone who likes dogs, or likes to laugh. It's hilarious and has good music. The best gift you can give someone."
3,Highly disappointed for only the movie.,"So not a whole lot of people would remember this but this was a great film, but the film was introduced through a Jim Henson Hour deal. It had a lot of great shorts and the making of dog city (shown by dogs). It was great. My sister got me this when I was in the hospital and was stoked and brought a smile. The movie is great, but not having behind the scenes, bean bunny trailers, kermit going crazy trying to find the reel to the film, and a robot guy or whatever is just highly disappointed. But shouldn't let it stop you from seeing this."
3,Hilarious dog story,"Dodge, I mean dog city is another of Jim Henson's funny tales with the furry muppets. Pretty good story plot. My husband and I enjoyed it."
2,Not good for toddlers,"My son *loves* the Muppets. However, this one is a let down. The Muppet Movie (new and old versions) and Space Muppets are his favorites."
2,dog city,I wasn't that thrilled with this dvd.It was far from one of Jim Henson's best movies. I didn't rate this very high.
2,Good for the basics,"While this is a good resource book to sit on the shelf, it is not an interesting, insightful, or enjoyable read. It is one of the most boring textbooks I have ever had to read. My professor was right: I will use this when I am a practitioner, but as a student, it is tough to get through. There are MANY, MANY spelling mistakes. Whoever edited this book should be ashamed. I can't wait until I am done this class so i never have to read through the book again. STUDENT TIP: Don't bother reading each chapter in its entirety; only read the summaries at the end of each chapter."
2,Authors need to reevaluate this product!!,"Lots of fluf, hard to read, harder to generate interest. 90% of this book is useless content, written only for the author's self-gratification and an egotistical infatuation with admiring their own complex writing style. Good opportunity for the writers to show off at a cocktail party among other PHDs, not very good for students."
5,Extremely helpful text!,It is always hard to keep personal bias out of the picture when evaluating an employee or coworker. This book understands that concept and goes beyond other books to demonstrate exactly how to do just that!
2,A large and bloated sleep-inducing book,"The prose in this book is so convoluted and each point takes so long to develop that you'll be soon asleep.What's worse, the book is neither a solid academic overview of the field nor is it a useful handbook for the practitioner.Rossi and his co-authors make many attempts to give us the grand theoretical frameworks but they quickly get lost in qualifying themselves into a tepid soup in which nothing is ever black or white, hot or cold, true or false.Although there are some capsule summaries and references to real programmes, these callouts are helpful only to break the tedium. They are not presented in sufficient detail that normal people could ever learn from them. There is never any clear instruction about how one should begin an evaluation or how one should proceed.Possibly this book is useful for an intermediate-to-advanced evaluation practitioner who is interested in comparing his broad generalizations with Rossi's."
1,didnt fit my 40gb - lost my money for nothing,bought this nyko intercooler and didnt fit my 40gb ps3.just lost money for nothing.
1,"Good initiative, bad judgement!","Fan blades were unbalanced and made horrible noises unless knocked around. If you want to charge your controllers you need to leave the fan on, not ""cool"". If something like this is ever engineered correctly I would love to buy it. Until then, don't waste your money, or time on this."
1,A fan to overheat your PS3,"I bought this product thinking that since my PS3 would be in a console cabinet with good circulation, this would help it to remain cool. In fact I have since removed this product beacuse it was overheating my PS3. Without this ""fan"" my PS3 runs cooler than ever before. Additionally, with this system installed you have to physically turn on/off the system every time you want to use it. It is a good way to make more noise, heat up that PS3, and waste money."
1,Piece of Junk,"Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. I am on my second Intercooler which has just recently broke. The first Intercooler worked fine for about a month and then started making a God awful noise. I paid for the postage and sent in the first Intercooler to Nyko and they sent me a brand new one. Well, that one worked okay for a few weeks and then started making the same God awful noise.Save your money or buy a game instead of this piece of junk."
2,For the First and second Gen PS3,The Intercooler will not work if you have a 3rd Generation or later Playstation 3. The fans block the HDMI and a few other ports
5,Stone cold,"This cooling fan is great, but do realize that you are adding fans so it will be louder. If you sit real close to your ps3 while playing it may be a little distracting but if you have a surround sound you won't tell much of a difference. Without any scientific numbers a can feel a difference in the temp. of the air coming out when the fans are on. It seems to be much cooler."
1,"Good Concept, BAD Quality","Updated review: Don't waste your money. It did not last through the end of the month.Original review:This product pushes more air into the unit and you can actually feel the hot air being pushed out and away through the back of the unit. An intercooler is especially important if you have the PS3 in an enclosed area such as a wall unit. The installation is easy, no tools required, simply align and push into place. The design compliments the PS3, it puts the power button in front of the unit and it has a knob to adjust the speed of the fans. This unit does increase the noise level but after a couple of days I got used to it and it's a non-factor. As you know, when you turn off the PS3, the PS3 fan also turns off; however, the intercooler fans keep running until you turn off the power button. Once I turn off the PS3, I leave the intercooler running for a couple of minutes to allow it to completely cool down the PS3."
1,Do not fit the system,"I purchase and when I get to install it, all the connections in the back are covered by the Intercooler.....That's really lame.....I strongly suggest the guys at Nyko to redesign their product. I am forced to send it back for refund."
1,READ ALL REVIEWS B 4 U BUYING THIS ITEM!,"I REFUSED THIS ITEM AFTER SEEING IT RATED 1 AS BAD ON EBAY & 2 1/2 HERE.1. IT TOO NOISY2. IM SURE IF IT CAUSE YOUR PS3 TO OVER HEAT, BUT IT""S DIFINATELY MAKES TO MUCH NOISE.3. IF YOU BUY THIS MAKE SURE IT'S VENTILATED, OWNERS COULD BE CLOSING THE CABIN DOORS TO REDUCE THE NOISE WHICH WILL ALSO CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO OVER HEAT AND BURN UP!"
1,continues to be delayed,"I have not yet received this intercooler, as it has been delayed 7 times! Why can't Microsoft and Sony just include better cooling to start with and stop gouging us for ""better"" performance."
2,JUNK,"I had high hopes for this device. It worked well for 2 weeks. Now, when I turn it on, it whines VERY loudly (a little less than a blender) and I have to bang it to get the noise to settle down. It's not a lot of money but it sure is a waste of it.It would NOT recommend this AT ALL."
2,"PS 3 Intercooler,",This item is not up to what it should be. I makes too much noise during use.That being said. Shame on Sony for making a product that needs this additional device. I have had to buy this just to cool the product so I could use it safely. Turning off the PS 3 without the intercooler is almost like cooking the electronics. A redesigned PS 3 or intercooler would be a marked improvement. I give both items a negitive feedback for it's cooling capacity and poor hardware design. The system does work other than that issue. Thanks for listening.Russell
4,PS3 Intercooler Works,"I find it hard to believe that this Nyko Intercooler would damage a PS3 like some people are saying, first you need to use it correctly in an open enviroment, not in a cabinet shut closed. I bought one and it looks like it will do just fine.I also took a Nyko PS3 Intercooler apart and found that it has it's own little fuse inside, so if there was ever a short circuit in it would stop at the Intercooler first.Now, I would of given it 5 stars, but because it does generate a bit of noise, it gets 4 stars.Other than that it does what is suppose to do."
1,Unnecessary,"I'll skip over the hardware problems with this product since everyone else has already mentioned them, and explain the biggest problem of all with the Intercooler - it is completely unnecessary. The PS3 has one of the best cooling systems ever put on a gaming system or computer. It has a huge 8"" fan, liquid cooling cables, and an enormous heatsink that takes up most of the bottom of the unit. It has been out for a year now and there have been no reports of the unit overheating. There is absolutely no reason to buy this or any other external cooling system, and this company is simply trying to sell you a product based on consumer's fears that they will overheat their PS3s."
1,Nyko Intercooler does not fit new Playstation 3 40GB,Just a word of warning to anyone who has recently purchased a new Playstation 40GB the Nyko Intercooler does not fit anymore. Playstation has redesigned the air slots on the back of the Playstation 3 and the clips on the intercooler don't line up properly. We called Nyko and they are aware of the changes and in fact informed us as to why it would not work. They are in the process of redesigning the Intercooler and said it would be another 3 to 4 months before they had a new one ready. So my recommendation to anyone looking to purchase one would be to call Nyko and find out if the new one is on the market before purchasing if you have a new Playstation.
1,"Unnecessary, causes more problems than it solves","This actually came bundled with my PS3; I certainly wouldn't have bought it.This cooler is loud, prevents you from really using your controller to turn the console on and off (you can, but the fans run all of the time if you do that), and it might even be causing more problems than it solves. Personally I would rather not have extra dust being blown into my PS3, especially since it doesn't seem to have any overheating problems to start with.I advise saving your money and not buying this product."
2,noisy but effective,"it really groans when you power it up for about 30 seconds, even on the lowest setting, it is loud enough to hear over the tv as background noise.but it seems to work pretty well."
1,Only a 1 star because there is no 0 star rating.,"Absolutely awful. I had to sand down pieces of it, so it would actually fit the PS3. It is also obnoxiously loud. It is really loud and squeaky if it has been off over night.DO NOT GET THIS!!!!!! If you want one....contact me..."
1,Not worth the money,"Mine worked 120 days running 24/7 and then quit. Of course the warranty is only 90 days. It did however run good when it worked. I can't comment on the noise level as I have a lot of other computers and fans running so it was barely noticeable to me.Another drawback is the lack of clearance between the unit and the network cable connector. No room for fingers to squeeze the little tab to unplug it. You have to use a small tool, knife blade or credit card. It can be done but not all that easy, just a minor annoyance because normally you do not unplug this cable all that much.I can say however the unit looks sweet. It matches the color and contours of the PS3 so it looks like it came as part of the unit and not an add-on."
3,Great Deal,"The PS3 Intercooler is amazing I still find it hard to believe that this much technoligy was that cheep. It has 5 fans to move the air and moves the main power switch from the rear of the PS3 to the front. I would have paid the same amount for a switch kit (to move switch from rear to front) as I paid for the whole Intercooler, great bargan. I have read the reviews where people complain about the noise and I don't see the problem? I do hear the Intercooler hum (louder then the PS3) but unless you are playing with no sound, you should not notice it. I play with TV and Stereo on but not with room shaking volume."
1,Intercooler,This Intercooler does not fit my PS3 the back is designed wrong and will not work with my PS3. I would like to know which PS3 this product would actually fit because ever PS3 I ahve seen is the exact same design as mine!?
1,Worthless - doesn't fit.,"This product is worthless because it covers up the plugs that all of the cables plug into. I don't know if I got a unit that was built backwards, or what. I see pictures of PS3s (like the one this site has), and they show the plugs on the right side of the unit (as viewed from the back). My unit has the plugs on the left side."
2,**WARNING** Can be annoying as hell,"I had read the reviews before buying this product. I thought I could put up with the noise, but now all I want to do is run it over with my car. For the first five minutes before the ps3 gets warmed up, the noise it makes is incredibly annoying, after that a slight tap and its like nothing ever happened. I blame cheap manufacturing.... BE ADVISED if you don't have the patience, seek an alternative!!!!"
2,Loud fan - needs a tap everytime,"This intercooler fan sounded like a great investment - it does it's job but it's SUPER LOUD. After turning it on, I always give it a good tap on the side to put the fan in the rhythm so it doesn't make a sound.I wouldn't recommended it - just leave your PS3 at least 5-6 feet off the ground to avoid unnecessary dust but not to close to the ceiling that it's just sitting in hot air. If you really want to help your PS3 vent hot air, clean and clear out dust from the ports at the bottom."
4,Best cooling fan ever,"I have the first PS3 system (don't know how many gigs it has though) and I had gotten this fan or an earlier version to go with it. My system has lasted for about 6 years due to this fan and I only had to clean the fan once! My current fan has just died after 6 years of hard core gaming this morning. Thank you my precious Intercooler for making these many years of gaming worth wild. O and I plan to get this one to replace my old one.Reasons for liking this fan:1) adjustable fan speed2) it actually works to reduce heat3) the ON switch is in the frontReasons you might not like the fan:1) can be loud at first but keep playing, you'll forget it's on2) slightly difficult to put on, be gentle though and don't loose your temper!3) plugs will be a tighter fit4) after three-four years it will begin to fade5) after three years the label will begin to peelOther than that it will be worth the purchase!-Bubbles"
1,doesn't fit,I ordered this for my 160 GB PS3 but no where in the description does it say it won't fit a 160GB. The access port is on the wrong side. Just some advice!!!
4,Keep your PS3 Cool!,"After reading the previous bad reviews, I had to say something. As an Electrical Engineer and someone who does electrical circuit and mechanical design, this is not a bad product. I knew before I even hooked it up that it would add an additional level of noise! It's something that I've learned to tune out and doesn't really bother me. What many don't realize is that heat is a semiconductors worse enemy. Just because the PS3 doesn't warn you, it doesn't mean that an accelerated degradation of the internal components is not taking place. The nice thing about the unit is that I can allow it to run a few minutes after shutting the system down. This prevents the internal temperature from rising due to residue heat once the PS3 is powered down."
1,Do not get this waste of space and money,"Anyone who owns a PS3 who knows a little about it's architecture, knows that the heat is dispersed very effectively away from the CPU and GPU. While it will be very hot on the side where the disc tray is the system itself will remain cool. This Product displaces that heat and draws it back over the CPU and GPU which are why the fans are needed in the first place making it counter productive to say least and is the only way this machine will come close to over heating unless you put it in a box, or cover it in a blanket. If you are smart and you want your PS3 to last then do not buy this product. It's not as bad as their 360 intercooler apparently but still a waste and more likely to do more damage then good."
1,Waste of time and MONEY,"I bought the Intercooler with my PlayStation. I'd heard they put off an incredible amount of heat and was concerned about it. However, the Intercooler is disturbingly noisy. The bearings in the fans go out quickly. and then you have an annoying useless shell encasing your PlayStation. Topping this all off I discovered that while the PlayStation does put off an incredible amount of heat, this is because it's pulling that heat safely off the 8 processors and venting it. Just don't keep your PlayStation in an enclosed entertainment center and it'll be fine. Oh, ... and don't waste your money on the Intercooler, just buy another game or movie.Oh .. and if anyone from Amazon actually reads this .... why am I reviewing a cooling device that's categorized as a GAME !!!!"
2,Not really a game,"It is a pretty good idea. However, it didn't really fit on the PS3 like advertised. It did not fit into the right slots on the side of the machine like it was suppose to. Now, it just kinda hangs on. It still does the job... sorta"
1,Don't buy these products.,"Adding 'intercoolers' to your console can void your warranty and interfere with proper proper air flow and voltage -- causing damage instead of preventing it. The Playstation 3 has passed very extreme environment testing well outside the suggested temperature operating range, and doesn't need an external cooler. Using this product will likely cause problems instead of preventing them.If you want to protect your console ensure you are using clean voltage ( avoiding spikes, sags, and surge ) by using an approved surge protector or Uninterrupted Power Supply. Also dusting off your console ever so often ( as you should ) for any other electronics device. If you keep the outside clean less particles will be sucked inside. Enjoy your consumer electronics longer by following proper maintenance guidelines, and read your instruction manuals for details."
1,PS3 Intercooler,"I love Intercoolers. Have one for My XBox 360. Works great. This one though. Well it seems well engineered and also seems to do well. The problem is well whats the deal with it not being compatible with the 40 gigabyte model. ARE YOU SERIOUS. THEY ARE ALL THE SAME EXACT DESIGN! THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE 2 USB PORTS INSTEAD OF 4 AND THE LITTLE DOOR IN THE FRONT! NO MODEL DIFFERENCES AT ALL. NEXT THEY WILL HAVE CERTAIN GAMES THAT WILL ONLY BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE 80 ANS 60 GIGABYTE MODELS. O COOL SOUL CALIBER 4. WAIT LOOK WHAT IT SAYS ON THE CASE. ""ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE 80 GIGABYTE PLAYSTATION 3. SO ANYONE WHO DIDN'T CHOOSE TO SPEND THE EXTRA $100 OR $200 TO BAD. YOU DON'T GET TO ENJOY THIS GAME."" MY RATINGS FOR PLAYSTATION IN GENERAL HAS GONE DOWN A GREAT PERCENTAGE.SORRY PS3 BUT YOUR RATING. 2 THUMBS DOWN AND STOP. THE NEWER THE PRODUCTS AND MORE ADVANCED YOU VIDEO GAME SYSTEMS GET THE WORSE AND MORE UNSTABLE THEY BECOME. I TAKE THAT 1 STAR AWAY"
3,"Inexpensive, effective........LOUD!!!!!!!!","The Intercooler plugs on easily, looks great on the PS3 and I believe does an effective job doing what it's suppossed to: cooling the PS3. My only way of telling this is that the PS3's fan itself didn't seem to kick into high gear while this was being used. I bought this because I mainly use my PS3 for watching bl-ray movies and the PS3's fan, when on high, is fairly noticeable during quiet scenes. Buying this made that issue even worse. Even with the Intercooler set to the lowest fan speed it was far louder than the PS3 itself in high fan mode. So, if you have a noisy environment anyway and just play loud action games, this is a great inexpensive way to assure your PS3 stays a little cooler which, as with all electronics, will increase it's life span. If you use your PS3 for movie watching, this fan is completely unacceptable. I'm returning mine, but I give it 3 stars because it does cool the Ps3 and it's only 30 bucks."
4,Timpa Duet Lace bikini,"A little tight, very low cut, not too good underneath jeans which match thongs better for their higher showing on the hips."
5,Worth the effort.,"Nothing I can write can either do justice to this collection or convince you to read it. Those goals are simply out of my persuasive power.All I can say is that Melville is one of those rare writers who works in the aggregate. He does not hit the nostalgia button like Twain, or compose a jaw-dropping sentence every other paragraph like Dickens. However, after reading much of Melville, a quality of reflection and thought is induced that is equally as valuable, if not superior, to some of his more immediately gratifying contemporaries.The LA Times stated that this collection ""Should find a place on every civilized person's bookshelf."" They were spot on.Combining this collection with Moby-Dick will make you more well-read, it will give you a greater depth to your literary knowledge, but more importantly, it will make you a better human being. And that is worth more than any pretty turn of phrase."
2,confused,"an interesting subject. but i found i had alot of questions after reading it. i feel it wasnt as ""beginner"" enough. it was written supposedly in that direction. but i felt it could have simplified even more so for the rank beginner such as myself."
2,A Waste of Your Time,"I was assigned this book as the only text for my ""Global Politics"" class. While it does a good job of explaining a few very basic theories in terms of levels of analysis, its descriptions of these are redundant, and the author makes the material seem irrelevant to the real world. She uses movies to explain the main ""myths"" behind the thoeries, but it's just a distraction so she doesn't have to address the real material. This book hardly talks about events in the real world or issues in international relations -- just theories! So do not expect to walk away understanding world politics -- but should you ever be caught in a discussion with institutional academics on realism and social constructivism, you'll at least be able to identify who came up with the theories. Don't waste your money."
5,Five Glorious Symphonies,"Don't miss these magnificent and sadly neglected symphonies in excellent performances and good sound. There are a few other recordings (the 2nd on Naxos, for example, and an old record of the 5th by Boult), but these either hold their own or beat out all competition. These works radiate a joy in being alive and are unmistakably English. If you love English music, you will love them."
3,Great art. Okay writing.,"Great art and cinematic staging make this book worth it.The characters are a bit flat and the action sequences are a little confusing at times, but all in all a pretty good read."
5,Brilliant! Glad it's on KINDLE!,"This is one of the seminal series ever to come out of Japan. What seems like a simple story, a man and his on on the road to revenge, is deceptive, as is the beautiful black and white artwork. Don't sit there reading any more of this review, RUN and go download this volume as well as 2 and 3. I am so happy these are on Kindle as I had to sell my collection a few years back. Brilliant!"
2,boring,"this manga is boring, and i didn't like the idea of putting so many nude pictures. so it is not suitable for kids and i don't like the stories that try to attract attention with this picture. the art is fine. the hero love to kill but still is a hero and we Supposed to love him and accept any thing comes from him. so this type of stories are very negative and only leads to gloomy and depressed world."
3,A good beginning to probable greatness,I wasn't all that moved to adoration by this first volume but overall I was entertained and interested enough to pick up the second volume. Vol. 1's artwork is much more interesting than the story therein. The second volume is where the series begins to come into its own.
5,sequential art classic,"It doesn't really matter if you like Japanese comics or American ones, in this case... This is a book you should read reguardless. It really is a classic.For those of you who don't really dig the whole manga thing, don't worry. There are no big eyes, cute mascots, or bouncy schoolgirls in this series. The art is gritty, and the stories are dark. Some will stick with you for years after reading them, and the two main characters are unforgettable as well.There's a reason why this series has the reputation it does. If you have any interest in sequential art or comic books at all, and if you can stand blood, gore, and some dark themes, you should without a doubt read this series. You won't regret it."
3,"great series, awful format","Obviously this is a classic. That's undisputed. However, why in the heck did Dark Horse put it out in such a tiny, tiny size? It would have been an amazing series if I didn't have to read it with a magnifying glass. What was the original format in the Japanese publication? I can't imagine the size was so small. The amount of detail in every frame, yet the tiny size of the book, makes it far less of an enjoyable read."
1,Lasted all of 5 minutes,I brought this for a birthday gift for my daughter who is pig obsessed....It broke the 1st time she used it... Shotty construction will never purchase from the manufacturer again....
3,don't waste your $,broke after 1 use and doesn't squeel...hand detached from rubber band. Also too diffucult for a child to pull back the elastic.
3,Fling Pig,"This toy is a lot of fun however only after a couple of uses, it no longer makes noises and the leg material came detached from the rubber bands underneath."
3,Not very impressed,I bought 4 of these in different styles for stocking stuffers. They are not very durable and two broke the same day. They are difficult to maneuver even for adults and impossible for small children. The sound only works occasionally. Not recommended for children because they are not strong enough to shoot them. Not worth the price. Would not purchase again.
3,incorrect photo,The photograph that you have of the product is not the one of the model that they have like reference. that produces bad reference to the buyer
5,God is crazy about you,"I heard her speak at a retreat. She has a horrendous story of living on the streets, but shows how God has always loved her. She is a true inspiration."
1,What happened?,"Where are the heartstring tuggers like ""falling down"", ""home"", and ""it's been awhile"" that you're known for staind?Not on this record, thats for sure.I couldn't find one song on C5 that i found the least bit interesting. Alot of them sound like older album rehash, but some are just too experimental for my tastes. This truly isn't a great album, and I'd recommend cold's a different kind of pain over it.14 shades of greay was emotional, well written and soothingDysfunction was brutal, hard hitting and unwaivering hard rock.Break the cycle mixed the best of both worlds with an original sound.Chapter 5 is...er, generic?Too bad, i was really looking forward to this one."
5,Great Investment,This Cd was a great investment. I love this Cd. I am really glad that I bought! You should buy it if you like this kind of music.
2,Staind - Chapter V,"well, sorry staind fans. i used to be a staind fan until i bought this one. it seems to me that staind has done the same thing as LB. every album after the first has steadily drifted away from their first image. i used to be able to classify them as a hard rock/metal band. however, the constant barrage of slow acoutical songs lull me to sleep. wouldnt bother me if the songs were the same caliber as ""So Far Away"" or ""Outside"", but quite frankly they are not. next time, i will wait to hear samples of their next album before purchasing on impulse."
2,No progress,"The early work from Staind was more aggressive and progressed into more positive and somewhat lighter music more recently. But on all of the previous albums, the mood felt honest. You really got pulled in by it. This one feels contrived, almost as if they didn't know how to move forward, so they went back."
4,"A step up and a mix of everything, which is very very good","This cd is great. I am really happy to hear staind put out a great cd after ""14 shades of grey"" which I honestly hated (yes hated). This is the redeeming cd for them. It is more like break the cycle and while some songs are very soft, some are heavy as well. Its a real mix of everything they've done, starting off with a typical staind sounding song ""run away"". ""Right here"" has really great verses, but the chorus reminds me of nickleback and it annoys me. I'm quickly sucked back into the music in ""paper jesus"" which instantly brings ""Dysfunction"" to mind. Its very heavy. Other songs I love are ""falling, Devil, Please, and King of all excuses"". Although those are my favorite songs, the whole cd is very good. Break the cycle is my favorite staind cd, but this is a close second. If you were dissapointed by 14 shades of grey, fear not this time around. No complaints really."
1,Staind?,The only song thats any good is right here.Ive listened to the cd over and over nothing really grabs me. Ive been a staind fan for a long time and i dont understand what they where thinkingon this record.
3,Decent album,"I have the previous three Staind CDs and while this one isn't the best of the bunch, if you're a Staind fan then it's worth getting."
4,Chapter V,"Wow, It looks like rockers staind have done it again. With Chapter 5 comes an album that has a distinct staind sound, yet a musical maturity. The album is all in all a good album, the one complaint I have is that it is at times too polished, the music seem too perfect at times. This album has everything, from hard rocking angst ridden songs to lovely soft songs, with a little edge of course. I would recomend this album for all staind fans and for anyone that wants a great rock album."
1,Horrid,"Stand should just break-up now. Nu-metal went out with Bill Clinton and Pokemon, I used to like staind, That was before i discovered elctronica."
3,Half hit and Half miss,That's what you should expect. Because that's what you will be getting. Only slightly better than 14 Shades Of Grey and not quite as good as Break The Cycle. Should you buy it? Of course. Because what's good here is great (as is always the case with this band).
4,Worth the money,"This is definitely a great release from the band. They perform at a level that to me, only Staind can perform at. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is almost simply because you about can't beat the immortal ""Break the Cycle"" album. This album is close. It's not as ""hit"" oriented as say 14 shades, the focus is more on making every song as passionate and fulfilling as the next. For the ballad fans, not any songs quite as strong as Zoe Jane or Outside, but Everything changes (the acoustic based song of the album) doesn't disappoint. I believe this album is worth every penny."
1,another garbage cd,"my friend copied this cd for me and i threw it out 9 mins later, i wanted to see if it was worth buying but like every other cd since there first one this was crap too, They need Fred Durst back to help them out. Unless your a teenaged girl you won't like this staind sold out again for the teenaged girls just like nickback did.... very sad"
2,Heard It All Before,"Ok. We get it. Aaron Lewis has had a a few bad girlfriends that he lets influence his music. That might have been enough for the first 2 albums, but for all 5. It gets a little old. I've always been there with Staind since I got Dysfunction, but I'm gonna have to pass on Chapter 5. It only gets two stars b/c I like their older work and well... I like their mainstream single Right Here. I love every cd that they've had before, especially Break the Cycle and 14 Shades of Grey and Staind is a great band. They just need some knew material and life experiences (or whatever they use in their music)"
1,This band really needs to get back their old sound,This band used to be heavy metal and s***. Heck they even used to remind me of bands on headbangers ball.now with this crap I am really dissapointed. Aaron Lewis used to be the most hardcore bada** I can think of and now he is the most biggest crybaby I have ever and will ever know. I don't know what made Aaron Lewis sad enough to make him ruin his music career but whatever happened he REALLY needs to get over it and make more records like 'dysfunction' and 'tourmented' because those records were some of his best workIf U agree with me press 'yes' under the thing that asks if U found this review helpful
3,its...ok...,"umm...i think staind is ok. i dont have the cd but ive listened to it many times...umm, i dont know if id reccommend it to you. only if you like punk rock, kind-of type. its not my fav band. but maybe top 20. i hope this is help ful to you."
3,The pity fest must end,"When will Aaron Lewis just quit whinning about being alone and depressed. Everybody treats you poorly, we get it."
2,I really wanted to love this album,"After the lackluster 14 Shades of Grey, I really hoped that Staind's new album could blow me away like they did the first time I heard them in my local music store. Unfortuantly, I realize that the band I love doesn't exist anymore. At least I still have Tormented, Dysfunction and the memories of the times I've seen them live. Now, this isn't an awful album but there's nothing that can separate them from the rest of the sludge you hear on the radio. If you want to hear music that really rocks, do yourself a favor and pick up a Local H album."
1,Where did they go wrong?,"What happened? Staind used to be all hardcore and everything and now they are soft rock and on this album they are stooping to soft high pich voices (don't know what I'm talking about? listen to 'Right Here' from this album) I don't know why they changed from hardcore good music to this soft crap but all I have to say is that I would like this band better if they made more albums like 'Dysfunction' and 'Tormented'. I have Dysfunction and I have a friend that let me borrow their rare but first record, Tormented. I think that Tormented is what introduced Staind's TRUE talent and Dysfunction is what proved Staind to truly to be hardcore and the rest of their albums they are all just get more soft and slow as more albums are released. The more they change themselves the harder it gets to like this band. Do you want to hear Staind when they were good? Listen to Tormented and Dysfunction"
2,Eh....,I only like 4 songs on this album and the tracks are 1 2 6 and 11 the rest i did'nt like so this was an okay allbum.
5,well worth the wait!!!!!!!,"this cd was well worth waiting for!!!!!i can't pick a favorite song,the whole cd is awesome!!!!anyone who has ever been a staind fan will surely love chapter v. and anyone who may not have listened to them in awhile should definitely pick up this cd!i have to say i don't agree with some of the other reviews.and no,i'm not an angry teen,but a 31yr.old married mom who loves this cd!"
4,A small step back to form.,"To me, Staind really fell from grace with 13 Shades of Grey. I loved Tormented, Dysfunction, and Breaking the Cycle. 13 SHades was just watered down to the point where the only reason you could tell it was them was Aaron Lewis' vocals. The hard edge that was evident on their previous efforts was all but gone.Chapter V is a step back towards Breaking the Cycle style Staind, but in no way comes close to the caliber of record that one was. Oh, well. I think we have seen the end of heavy Staind and will only see a more mainstream version from now on. As long as they stay similar to Chapter V and don't water themselves down any more, I will stay a fan regardless."
1,"Meet The New Dork, Same As The Old Dork","How could the powers that be possibly believe that lunkhead metal from five years ago has relevance in 2005? Aaron Lewis over-emotes more than Chris Carrabba, while the crunching of the chords and the smashing of the drums give their teenage fan base all the reason in the world to believe the lies. But the dullards who buy into this are the same dimwits first on line in the 'I Hate Emo' bandwagon, the 'Boy Bands Suck' collective. Well, kids, this Boy Band sucks too. My grade: C+"
1,This album SUCKS!!!,"All the songs sound the same, and they all suck. They suck bad. Boring, boring. I tried to force myself to listen to the whole CD, hoping that eventually I'd find something worth listenting to. But after the first 5 songs, I couldn't tolerate the monotony, so I gave up.Don't waste your money, or your time."
1,WTF happend to this band,"The first Album rocked. I saw these guys perform 3 times that year and insisted on being in the front row.Now....... they just suck!!!!Its just been one horrible transition after another with this band.Must have been invasion of the body snatchers or somthing, because this is not the same band that came out with an awesome debut album.Wasted time... I didnt buy this P.O.C.A.I would have been really upset if I would have.Another one bites the dust!"
1,More Shades of Gray? UGH,"The fall of Staind is very astounding. If you put Dysfunction in against Chapter V you won't even hear the same band. Please Staind, give us more mid-tempo rockers with Velvet Revolver type solos in the middle. Or please serenade us with another ballad, since each album you must put on more and more ballads. ""Right Here"" sounds like ""So Far Away"" or any other song from Chapter V/14 Shades which are basically the same album and are interchangable. Or you can listen to ""Everything Changes"". Too bad you already heard it on 14 Shades and Break the Cycle.Staind really has turned to garbage. I am ashamed to say I used to work promotoions for them back in 1999. They have truly gone down the sewer hole. Even the supposed hard songs like ""Run Away"" are garbage. And dont get me started on ""Trippy"" another joke of a song. The only thing Staind has to worry about is tripping over their own feet to cash the checks of gullible MTV kiddies.SELLOUT LOSERSOverall Grade: D/D-"
4,Gilbert and Sullivan meet the Soviet Union,"I do not know how much of this music is Shostakovich and how much is the Pimlico production. But it is fun to listen to--raucous, satirical and fast-moving. Most of the performers are very good."
4,A good start.,"Despite what's been posted here, this isn't an album of ""sunny pop songs"". Ralston dwells in break-ups, death, failure on Needle Bed. And it's pretty good stuff, despite that it sounds like it was recorded in a home studio (it partially was). Some of the turn phrases (see No One Said..., Avalanche) seem like abortive attemps at ""hooks"" - I prefer it when he plays it straight, as with the album's gem, Gone Gone Gone, which with any luck will break into AC radio. Buy and enjoy."
5,Good CD,"If you get this CD for a penny on the used tab it's a good deal. Even if you paid full price for it there are great songs on this CD. No One Said This Was Easy and I Believe In Ghosts are two of my favorites. Saw him open for Dashboard. Dashboard had the better show, but I appreciate this CD more than any Dashboard I've heard recently. I agree with an early review comparing JR to Elliott Smith. There's a bit of Ben Folds (a bit) as well as a song that sound very reminiscent of Dashboard. Bonus tracks you can download. CD is too short. Looking for more in the future."
2,Beware: allows for easy dumping of liquid,"The quality of the spouts is great, but I was unaware that when using these spouts the child can dump an entire cup of milk by simply turning the cup upside down. The liquid just pours out of the spout. I guess I didnt read the description well enough to understand this before I purchased them."
4,Anti Semetic?,"A truly laughable conclusion. You might as well accuse the book of being biased against accountants, women at work, cavalry officers... etc. etc. add infinitum.Good, rich, readable stories offering a glimpse of the vast expanse of Spanish literature. I liked it so much, I also bought the second book in the series (which I can also recommend, though I enjoyed this one more). A agree somewhat with A. Reader from Connecticut that the translations are not literal, but literal translations result in non-English - English which makes for poor reading. The stories loose very little, if anything, in the translation."
2,Marred by anti-Semitism,"My reading pleasure was marred by the fact that at least some of the stories in this anthology reflect none-too-subtle and gratuitous anti-Semitism. The first story, for example, amounts to an attempt to justify the murder of a Jew. The second story, a generally humorous and wry commentary on the bureaucracy, specifies, in an apparent attempt at humor, that it was a Jew who acquired the books purchased by one financially over-extended bureaucrat.Only if Spanish literature was, at the relevant time, profoundly anti-Semitic do these stories provide a fair and representative sampling. If so, perhaps the forward should warn the reader. If not, then the replacement of the anti-Semitic stories in this anthology with non-racist stories would be a most-welcome improvement."
5,Most Romantic Movie Ever,"This is a movie I grew up watching every year with my mother and sisters. It's a tear-jerker, classic Arturo de Córdova and Marga López, the most romantic couple ever in Spanish films. My mother is now 82 years old and I can't wait to receive my movie so that we can watch it together on New Year's Eve--just like we did when I was a little girl!"
1,Does Said Product Exist?,"I am usually not one to write negative reviews, but I have been particularly frustrated with my experience with Adorama and since several other customers have experienced the same issue I thought it should be addressed.Last month, I ordered this Small LiteDome Softbox and instead received the XS LiteDome Softbox. After returning the item to Adorama and receiving my refund from Amazon, I re-submitted an order for the Small LiteDome Softbox. Again, Adorama shipped the same incorrect item- an XS softbox. I have heard and read reviews of other customers who experienced this very same problem.I was on vacation so I have passed my 14 day grace period for refunds and returns, but I am hoping they will extend some courtesy.I am going to pay a premium and buy this elsewhere."
3,Not bad,"This book is really funny in parts. The twelve step approach was a neat spin on the whole idea of women's empowerment; there was a nice satiric bite to the concept. Overall, the book does have some serious moments, in with the humor. The insights just aren't deep enough to really stick with the reader. The book is very easily disposable. She doesn't really have alot to say that hasn't been said before, and parts of the book drag, or are a bit more crude than I like. But the Krispy Kreme stuff is hilarious (I'm now desperate to try them!) and there were other parts where I definitely laughed, which I can't say about every humor book I've read. There are moments in this book where Michon's own Grrrl Genius shines through, but she can't seem to sustain it.Worth it if you see it in a used book store or a garage sale, but don't go out of your way to track it down."
5,Cathryn Michon IS a genius!,"The author of this book has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of identifying and then demolishing the myths and misconceptions which hold back women from their teens onward. Body image, intelligence, relationships-- she explains with dead-on humor why grrls need to shed their insecurities and rejoice in themselves. Parents of teenage daughters should make this required reading for themselves and their children. I laughed with every page, but I also carried forth a determination that from this point forward, my daughters will regard themselves as geniuses!"
1,Not worth it,Don't even bother reading this book. (...) this book is a waste of time. Of course its very repetitive since there are many books out there on the market like this. Three Black Skirts by Anna Johnson would be a better book to read.
1,Sell Yours Quick!,I was excited about getting this book as I thought it would be hilarious and uplifting. Notice how everyone is trying to get rid of this book way below cost- this tells us something.
3,Same Old Story,Based on other reviews I watched this movie not expecting much. I've seen this same basic story with a twist here and there many times before. The acting was OK but for the most part this story has been told over and over way too many times. OK to rent but not recomended as a keeper.
4,"Not the Best, Obvious Copycat, Low Script, But Did Surprise","As with another reviewer, I got the movie because of Morgan Freeman. It was a three a third of the way through the movie, as Benderas carried out a light-weight rip-off of the scene fromEntrapmentin which the female star navigates randomly moving red lights--as others say, a lot of this is light-weight rip-offs from others movies.HOWEVER, the movie began to surprise two thirds of the way through, I stayed with it, and it ended VERY strongly, almost but not quite enough to bring it up to a five.Lots of other movies are better, apart from all others by Morgan Freeman, this one is definttely a ""sideshow"" in his career, the following come to mind:Firewall (Full Screen Edition)Live Free or Die Hard (Unrated Edition)Lord of War (Widescreen)Face/OffBasicSmiley's PeopleCasino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)Rising Sun"
2,Another Formula Heist,"The first 120 minutes unfortunately presents a poorly scripted formula heist where the dialogue was juvenile simplistic and unrealistic. You get plenty of stereotypic bad and good guys - Russian mob, dumb cops and a sophisticated art robber who teams with a mistake prone street robber to pull off the ultimate heist. Then there are all the standard tech talk and props to make the movie look impressive but come off as old-school '80s shtick. As far as acting Freeman is in a rut neither detracting nor adding much to his character or the movie. On the plus side the obviously expected twisted ending was fairly well done."
2,Just another typical heist movie,"Just another typical heist movie, without any interest, except for the fact that the great Morgan Freeman stars in it.But that isn't enough to make the film move forward to, at least, becoming entertaining, what unluckely never happens; and Antonio Banderas role doesn't add anything to that purpose.If you like good heist movies, you should move to last year's English film ""The bank job"", instead."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this movie because I read that Tom Hardy was in it but once I watched, I learned that it was for only 2 minutes!The movie was ok... Pretty predictable."
2,"Like ""Ocean's Eleven""...","...but not funny. Like ""The Usual Suspects"" but not clever. ""The Code"" is a lame attempt that limps along through a contrived story to a weak ending. Even with one good and one great actor, the movie still can't find it's way to being interesting. Of course, they do throw in some gratuitous sex scenes with a hot blond to keep people's attention. Honesty, that was probably the best part of the movie...Not recommended."
2,A waste of film,"An inferior and fairly unbelievable heist picture that substitutes style (a la CSI-type garbage) for substance. It is redeemed only by the ever-watchable Morgan Freeman.If you want to see a really good heist movie, try 'Heist' with Gene Hackman or 'The Score' with Marlon Brando."
4,GUILT IS NOT IN MY VOCABULARY,"This is one of those crime thrillers that screams, ""See how clever I am."" You know from the mild beginning twists to expect more plot twists. The game I played was ""How many twists can you identify?""Famous art thief Ripley (Morgan Freeman) recruits jewel thief Gabriel Martin (Antonio Banderas) to help him pull an impossible heist. Gabriel falls for Alexandra (Radha Mitchell) a friend of Ripley's. Meanwhile Lt. Weber (Robert Forster) is investigating Ripley, knowing he is going to rob a rich Russian living in NYC.The film moved quickly and kept me entertained. I enjoyed the acting and the dialouge with its innuendos. It is light enough of a crime thriller for the ladies to enjoy. The characters remind you, ""Don't assume anything.""Parental Guide: Brief F-bombs, sex, and nudity, but not excessive. Each in itself might constitute a PG-13 rating but collectively they would get an ""R."" Was that Banderas' naked butt in that love scene or a body double? I am guessing a double."
2,Dragged,"Antonio Banderas? He mumbles so much I needed the close-captioning but that isn't available on Amazon On Demand. The plot was ok - I give it one star above the bottom because the twists were good. Honestly, it just had the wrong cast. This is a movie that needs someone mysterious or a a little more action. Basically, it just needed more of everything. It was like chili with no spices."
1,Why was this book ....,"...printed? Parts are so utterly simplistic to deserve the title ""dumb"". I suspect the writer is in the throes of a severe clinical depression. The world has come to an end for the past several thousands of years and look where we are. Many of the serious problems we are having are addressed as we speak. Just remember: after every ice age there was a warming and vice versa.Remember the spate of books just before 01/01/2000, predicting every computer would be going gaga? Same here. Nice try, Sierra Club; you just gave me another reason to take you much less serious as I once did.Ah, yes.The filthy lucre...."
5,Excellent Dinnerware!,"I was very pleased with the looks and quality of this dinnerware. Good for every day use, but also good enough to use in formal dinners. Don't hesitate to buy it!"
3,An overview in pictures.,"Basically, this book is an overview of Canada's role in the Great War through pictures. Each page has a photograph or two along with a somewhat detailed caption. Anyone who has researched the topic has probably seen many of the pictures before, and the information is obviously not useful. But this does make a good introduction for students at the high school level and below, although there are a few photos depicting the grim realities of war."
5,Save the day,"This was perfect! Exactly what I needed for my class reunion! I searched every store around town and couldn't find anything. I looked online and found this in a matter of minutes. When I received it, it was exactly what I was looking for!"
4,Captivated but not Captured,This video is a rarely spoken truth that will set out future course --- sad. Can we change the course?
2,Inconveniant,Thise pipe hanger are somewhat inconveniant. You need to add to prepare two pipes (not provided) to mount the hanger to the ceiling. A much simpler and conveninant solution is to use instead a small metal tie around the pipe to provide only one anchor which make installation much easier.
4,Well written and only necessary gunplay,"Worthy, I ordered season one, watched it, ordered the next two seasons immediately. Nuff said."
5,One of the greatest TV (Western) series ever.,"Always well written and acted. So, when do the next 3 seasons arrive on DVD. I'm ready now!"
