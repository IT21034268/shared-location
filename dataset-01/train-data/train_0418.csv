2,there has to be something better,"i find this casebook to be very disorganized, unclear, and repetitive. there has to be a better sec reg casebook out there somewhere."
3,"It stinks, but it is thorough","I am currently taking Securities Law and we are using this book. It is highly dense, and the authors are poor writers. They clearly know the material and understand the distinctions, but I am often frustrated that they simply do not make their points more clearly. My advice is simple: if you are required to use this text, get it, but also use the Examples & Explanations book by Alan R. Palmiter because the prose is much easier to understand. I cannot speak for the other study aids, but they may work too. The key is getting one to complement this book. I think the E & E is a good choice because securities law is easier to learn by tackling problems and the E & E book has problems and answers (the casebook has problems too, but no answers -- you get those from the prof). Good luck!"
4,Nice and absorbant,"I also have eczema, and have most lotions to be ineffective. Usually I use a very heavy cream or something like Vaseline to keep my skin in somewhat good condition, but in the summer these can be sticky and uncomfortable and I always have a sneaking suspicion that bugs are going to stick to my legs. Complex 15 is very light and absorbant, but it still moisturizes very well. It's a little thin for the very worst of my rashes, where the skin is already cracked and thickened, but for the rest of my body I think it works really well. I don't feel sticky at all, and it's non-irritating so I can put more on throughout the day. It's also light enough to use on my face. It absorbs quickly, so I don't have to wait long to add sunscreen. All in all, it's the best thing I've found for overall skin moisturizing for my eczema in the summertime."
2,Not that great,"I ordered this lotion because a friend said it was fantastic. I have really sensitive skin. It burned and itched my face. I had to wash it off right away.,so I use it on my hands. Not very good moisturizer. My hands were dry again after a few minutes. I wouldn't recommend this for really sensitive skin. My husband likes it ."
4,great moisturizer,Have been usnig this for years. THis is the only moisturizer that I can use regularly and not break out.
5,Best face lotion on the market,Best lotion ever had. It is not greasy and is truly fragrance free. My husband uses it as an after shave lotion and says that it makes his skin very smooth and soothes after shave irritation.
5,Moisturizing Lotion,My friend tells me that this is a very good product and does what it says on the tin!!! Everyone is happy. Thank you.
1,?????????????????????????????????????????????,I've never realy even seen this movie so what should i be sayin
5,Great anime,This has to be a good dvd since the whole oav series (which I saw on the sci fi channel lots of years back when I was 10) introduced me to anime (and since it was up really late got my mom mad at me for staying up) but its a good movie so it should be a great dvd. :)
4,^_^,"8-Man After - Perfect Collection is a great story. Though it cuts out a few parts from the multi-set OVA, it does such a good job, you don't miss much. No matter your taste in genre, this movie has something for you."
3,"Pretty cool, but pretty off base from its origin...","There are three kinds of 8th man fans. Those who followed the original Japanese, those who saw the original Japanese series in English so many years ago, and those who saw this movie. Standing on its own '8 Man After' is a well drawn yet cliche middle of the road anime. The typical cyborg enemy taking over a slightly futuristic society is a pretty well trodden road, yet the cool design of 8th Man huimself entertains and transcends the hokey sci-fi stylings of the old TV series. The DVD gives no special features. If you like this movie, go back and try to unearth the 1960's American dub TV episodes....and prepare for a trip into the absolutely ridiculous which empowered this character since its debut."
4,good guide,I agree with Maltin's reviews more times than not. Many times he has steered me towards a movie that turned out to be enjoyable.
4,A decent reference book.,"This is a very handy reference. I don't believe Mr. Maltin actually saw all 20000+ films reviewed. Nevertheless it gives just enough information about each title to let you decide whether it's even worth your while to rent it. You don't have to agree with each rating, but I find myself more often than not agree with Mr. Maltin's."
4,"Closest Thing to a ""Bible"" There Is","When it comes to rating judgments I don't always agree with Maltin and his crew, but who would? I don't think there are any video guides that come close to matching the Maltin series for comprehensiveness and user-friendliness. I always reach for mine when an unfamiliar movie looms, and I often check the rating when an old favorite comes up--more often than not Maltin or one of his editors will offer some beguiling bit of production gossip or shed some other light on a favorite film. Yes, the book is so big it's getting hard to deal with but that's because it's an embarrassment of riches.One unusual feature of the book is its alphabetization system. It uses a STRICT letter-by-letter system where spaces don't matter; in other words; ""Intermezzo"" precedes ""In The Line of Fire."" Really, it's quite a rational system once you get used to it.Some of Maltin's judgments make me hoppin' mad, but overall the book is a gem."
2,"Good lists, bad reviews","It's great for a quick look-up for movie titles and actors, but as far as the reviews go: what an idiot! He gave Dark Star ""**2 1/2"". The man has no sense of humor, and wouldn't know a great movie if it was playing in his tuchas."
1,Rated B for BOMB,"THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE BOOK EVER WRITTEN.BUY A COPY,THEN BURN IT! RATED B FOR BOMB!"
1,This book is Rated B for BOMB!,"One word describes this book-HORRENDOUS! Leonard Maltin is no longer a good film critic and should sit down and watch a movie with an experienced critic so he can do another book with more information,longer reviews and being more sensible.He gave practically all of the Halloween films bad reviews,including the original! He gave all of the Phantasm films a 1.5 and gave practically every Friday The 13th film bad reviews! shame on you Leonard Maltin! Want good,sensible reviews with better information? Leave it to me! Rated B for BOMB!"
3,"FINE, BUT WHERES THE SERIES?","I am a HUGE fan of Dark Shadows...and this collection of some of MPI's compilations and documentaries is a nice start....but who wants a Spanish episode on a Region 1 disc? I could see it as an extra on the disc of the English episode....oh well, very informative programming for those into the series. I have one question for MPI: WHERE'S THE ORIGINAL SERIES ON DVD? With DVD18, they could fit the entire series on 50 volumes or less...but nothing is scheduled....MPI: fans are waiting"
3,I agree a good start,"I don't have any new imformation to add. I just wanted to also express an interest for MPI making the series available on DVD. I would add that I enjoyed the Nightmares and Dreams section. It brought back memories from the show, though there were some that needed more of the storyline to remember what was taking place to bring on the dream."
2,house of glass,"The back cover makes the story sounds very interesting, but the dialogue has no life, in fact the whole content of the book is boring. I couldn't make the effort to finish reading this book. Michelle Reid must have wrote this book in her sleep. It doesn't have her usual hot intensity like ""A Passionate Marriage""."
5,Replaement camera batteries,Batteries arrived timely. I charged them and immediately put them to use. Everything is fine. Very good experience.
5,perfect,"The Spectra Premium HO12A Fuel Tank for Honda Integra, is the perfect fit for my Acura Integra 1998, now my integra can run every day."
4,This is a very nice watch,I have always loved watches that provide utility. I normally don't spend much on watches. This time I splurged and I am glad I did. The watch is very professional looking. The functions are very nice. It has the perpetual calendar which I find indispensable. If you are a person who has had watches that don't have this feature you will love this. The watch does not need a battery. The watch is a bit complicated to set at first. A CD is provided that makes it very easy to follow. After initial setup it there is no maintenance except for DST or if you change the alternate time you set. You can set two times on the watch but this is only good if you are staying that time zone. It is not good for quick reference. The watch provides day of the week and calendar date. The alarm on the watch only works in the master time zone not the alternate time zone. It is a bit quiet if you are a deep sleeper but works admirably. I think you will enjoy this watch.
4,"Nice Lookng Watch, But Not Very Accurate","Everything good written in other reviews is true regarding the looks and unique features of this watch. My only complaint about this watch is its accuracy; it loses about 15 seconds every month, which is not so great. I've owned it for about a year and all functions have worked as advertised."
2,Not what you would expect,"I have owned the Citizen Calibre for a couple of years now. I have only worn it as a dress watch. The stainless steel scratches easily and quickly loses its luster. The real issue, however, is that the computer will no longer keep the date correct. I have system-reset the watch several times, but it just keeps showing the incorrect date after a month or so. Now, in calendar mode, it will not even allow December to be set. I guess it needs another reset. I would have to say that the watch just did not meet expectations commensurate with price. Initially what appeared striking and gorgeous, now simply a paper weight. Alas."
4,"Pretty watch, pretty complicated","I have found this item to be very functional, but changing from one mode to another is time consuming (literally). For the most part, I leave it in the local time mode and have GMT as ""TIME"". The alarm works well, but I rarely use it. Setting and changing anything on the many readouts requires reading the thick booklet; nothing intuitive about it. I did not like the original leather strap (too bulky at the clasp and too small for my 8"" wrist) so I have replaced it. Overall, well worth the price paid; not having to change batteries or maintain a mainspring by winding or wearing is a tremendous convenience (compared to my Rolex or Omega)."
3,Complicated.,"Although it looks classy and has that expensive feel to it, it is extremely complicated to set the time. I have never worked with more complicated system! I ended up returning it and buying something more self-explanatory. Its not good when you need to read the full manual to understand how to operate a watch..."
3,Very user-unfriendly,"It's a quality watch with nice features, but I don't think you should have to read a user's manual to simply set a wristwatch- but with this model, you do. It's the only electronic device I've run arcoss that I absolutely needed the manual to figure out. It's frustrating enough that I wouldn't buy another."
2,pretty but complicated,i just found this watch more watch than i needed !! dont need alarms two time zones---- the booklet is like a phone book of instructions-- everyone else seems to love it-- it is pretty to look at-- but way too much watch for me-- and who could read that booklet of instructions ??? not me----i was intimidated by this thing !!!!!!!
5,Nice!,Great looking watch. Neat leather strap with an interesting buckle. I love the perpetual calendar feature and the ecodrive. I thought initial setup was interesting and enjoyed the initial set up. Felt like figuring out a new gadget.
4,Bargain of the year,"I paid $179 for this watch from Jomashop and it was worth every penny. I just got it today. I was a little worried that it would take a long time to figure out how to set it up but the cd that comes with it made it easy. First, the pictures of the watch are a little misleading. The bezel has a shiny chrome finish (it looks flat in the pictures) and the numerals and face are silver (in the picture they look black). The band is good quality. It has a clasp fitting which makes the clasp somewhat bulky on the wrist, but not a big deal to me so far. I think the lense is mineral and my guess is it is lesser quality than sapphire, but still is very good for the price. The watch automatically sets the day of the month and adjusts for leap year, but I don't think it handles daylight savings. The size of the watch is good as it is not too big or too thick. I also like that the hour and minute hand glow in the dark."
4,It's great..,"This watch is really good. Looks great, is pretty accurate (I've only had it for a month now). The only issue is that if you have to set or check the alarm, it could take a couple of minutes to do so depending on the current time and when the alarm is set. This is particularly not useful for quick setting. Also, if you want to set your ""other"" time zone, can only be done in 1 hour inc/decreements. So forget about 30 min differences.But these are trivial issues, the hour/minute have very good visibility even in low light conditions: reflected light from these hands make it easier to read."
2,Strap broke in less than six months,"I usually don't write reviews but this could not go unchallenged. I bought the watch to wear with business attire, in turn, used twice a month. The strap broke near month 6 of my ownership.. Twelve times worn and it breaks!? Warranty doesn't cover straps.. then good luck trying to find a replacement as they are proprietary 20mm straps at 50 bucks a pop. Check out other citizen watches.. they all have complaints about the straps."
5,Citizen Eco-Drive Men's Calibre 8700 Watch,"This was a 28-years anniversary present. My husband is very pleased with it and that makes me happy. It is a beautiful watch, and the different functions it performs intrigues my husband. The pictures of the watch and the previous posted comments were also most helpful in making a selection."
4,Great watch,"I bought this watch as a gift for my husband who was very particular about what type of watch he wanted. He never wore a watch before, and he loves this one!"
5,"I love this watch, 4 years and still perfect","I bought this watch while my wife and I were on a cruise down in the Cayman islands about 4 year ago. I had always wanted a nice watch and always settled with Timex, so to step up to a citizen was great. I've had the watch for the past 4 years and it's still in great condition. I love that it's light powered so there is no messing with a battery. It's entertaining to get up in the morning and turn on the light and see the hour and minute hands start spinning to catch up to the current time. I love the technology on this thing. Not once have I had to adjust the date, replace a battery, or the wrist strap and I wear this thing 5 days a week to work. I've dropped it a few time and even hit it pretty hard on metal cabinets on accident and there are no scratches on the face. It's a great watch, it's a touch watch, I really do love this watch. Highly recommend it."
2,"Nice, but not lasting","Got this watch in 2010. Very classy looking watch with great functionality. Now, it's a paperweight. The eco drive must have gone dead...even after charging in bright sunlight, dead. I think this will be the last Citizen watch I purchase. I will be contacting Citizen, and will update the post if anything changes; however, at nearly a $300.00 price point...I expect to get more use than just over a year and a half. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a watch that doesn't need to be ""serviced"" in such a short amount of time."
4,Citizen Men's Calibre 8700 Watch,"Generally, a well made and great looking watch. However, I've got 2 minor gripes. One, the day is difficult to read, letters are too small and etched on a shiny surface. Basically, cramping too many stuff on a small watch face. Two, the strap is loose even when set at the last hole for those with small wrist. This strap has 7 holes for adjustment compare to the usual 9-10 holes for most other leather straps."
3,Good price,Great price. We could not beat it anywhere! But we did but 2 of them for our daughters phones and one of them did not work.
5,Its the best!,Hi. Sailor Moon Volume #1 is great. The manga is way better then the anime. This one is very good. Once you start you won't want to stop till your finished. I know cause I couldn't! The pictures are great. They would be even cooler in color but there still great. It is a wonderful story about a girl that finds out that she is destined to be a sailor scout. Its very good.
1,DISHONEST SALES,"This seller changed the volume # of the book I ordered by handwriting ""8"" next to the ""1"" sending volume 18 rather than the 1st book of the series. To make matters worse, they did not respond to my email or attempt to make any effort to rectify this situation. I will never buy from them and highly advise others not to as well."
4,"Good manga, not-so-good translation","Sailor Moon Volume 1 is the thing that started it all. The original.But TOKYOPOP's translation was all but the original. All the sound effects were altered, and sometimes the words got cut off the page. Also, the worse thing was that they CHANGED THE NAMES!!!For you people who are curious, here is the original:Bunny = Tsukino UsagiAmy Anderson = Mizuno AmiRaye = Hino ReiLita = Kino MakotoMina = Aino Minako"
5,I loved it!,"It was a very nice book. Unlike the American Manga, I could actually understand it. It covered the story up pretty far, and was very interesting to read. I suggest this to all Sailor Moon Fans! It's really great!"
4,Not bad...,"All in all, it's not bad for a dub. Not quite the original, but great for those of us who can't read Japanese. It's a must-have for any American Sailormoon fan! Those who only know the DiC dub are in for a big (and pleasant) surprise. The storyline of the manga is generally more intense, but I prefer it to the anime. Mixx has done a much better job than DiC or CWI (no ""Mini-moon"", they stayed true to Chibi). I own the original, and the translation is mostly accurate other than the name changes. A few mistakes, but nothing that completely changes the storyline."
5,I don't know how many times I've read this book !,"This book is really great. I've probaby read it a million times trying to save up for the next ones. Naoko Takeuchi did a great job on the drawings, esspicaly the romantic seen between Tuxedo Mask and... Opps said too much.(You probably all know who it's with)This book introduces the first 4 scoutesand is much different from the choped up DIC version America gets shown.Everyone go and search for S.O.S(support our sailors)and get Japan to bring over the other episods. All in all it is a great book for any Sailor Moon fan."
4,A good beginning,"A good beginning to the Sailor Moon storyline. Yes, it is very similar to the beginning of the English anime version, but it gets different soon enough. I like the books because the pace is quicker than the anime (they originally came out at the same time and the anime had to space out bits of story so as to not outpace the manga). Takeuchi paces the story well, and even if you have seen the anime there are enough changes that if you want to read the manga you should probably start here. There are some humorous moments not included in the anime, for instance. If you would like to see the Sailor Moon storyline without the Monster Of The Day, get this book."
4,"Comedy,Romance and all of the above!","Enter Bunny. A ditzy,homework-hater and food lover. On the way to school one day she runs into this cat named Luna. Luna tells her that Bunny must become Sailor Moon, a champion of justice. She must find the Princess and protect her. That is her destiny..."
5,AWESOME...just completely AWESOME...it blew me away!!!!,"This book is a MUST HAVE for any sailor moon fan! It is funny, romantic, and it has its fair share of action! I know I loved sailor moon anime before I read this, now I also am into the manga! If you do know sailor moon, get this book! If you dont know sailor moon DEFINATELY get this book. I dont think there is ONE unsatisfied customer out there!"
5,FABULOUS JOB! BEAUTIFUL ART WORK!,"THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR ALL TRUE SAILOR MOON FANS! It isn't the original, but it is better than the anime - Bunny is more mature, and the characters don't act as silly or dumb. Best of all, the romance between Bunny & Darien is apparent from the first chapter!"
5,sailor moon 1,this book talks about sailor moon but in a different way from the tv show serena's name is changed to bunny .and the sailor scouts appear in each chapter one after the other.and sailor mars destroy jedite from her attacks.this book is a great book but if your scared fo skeletons don't buy book 2 or 6
3,Sailor Moon. Vol 1,"Everyone's favorite school girl turned superhero! Join Bunny/Serena,Luna,Tuxedo Mask and the scouts in there exciting adventures. This is the orignal Sailor Moon comic from Naoko Takeuchi that launched the mega hit TV show everyone loves! Designed to be pocket sized so Sailor Moon can go everywhere with you! ages 11 and up"
4,Pretty good,"It works as described. I am hanging a Fuji road bike, weighing about 30 pounds and it seems secure. I've even done some minor repair work on the bike as it's been hanging and it held up even then. My only complaint is that the rubber cover on the hook slides off easily. Every time I remove the bike it gets closer and closer to falling off, but if you are conscious of this and simply slide it back your problem will be solved!"
4,Strong,"Works great, I have 2 of them hanging side by side, My only word of advice: Double check that you have found a stud mount this to. I'll be reviewing a new stud finder because of this soon."
4,Racor Solo Bike rack,"Easy to install, shipped quickly, solidly constructed. Attractive and simple bike hanging solution- product does what it claims.The only reason I didn't give it ""5 stars"", was because I bought three of them and the two mounting screws were missing from one of them. It wasn't worth complaining about as they were 2 simple wood screws, but a minor annoyance.FYI: This item is listed all over the internet at 2-3 times Amazon's price!"
4,Does the job.,"I looked at several similar products before I bought the Racor Solo Bike Racks. The Racor racks from Amazon were the least expensive. The white color of the ones I bought look the most unobtrusive in my apartment. Although the instructions say the racks must be mounted to a wall stud with included hardware, I mounted mine to sheetrock (wallboard) using two large moly bolts for each one. (Do this at your own risk.) My two racks have worked quite well at holding my fairly light road bike and my heavier commuter bike. I docked one star for fit and finish. otherwise, I'm happy."
3,Bike hanger does what is should,"The rack is sturdy, works and goes up with two screws. It is an average bike hanger. It would be nice if the rack had a bigger loop so a 29er mountain bike would be easier to hang and the hanger accommodated wide tires. I don't think the padding will last very long either.Overall, it works well for 26 bikes unless your tires are 2.4 inches or wider. 2.2 inch wide tires are fine. I would not recommend it for 29er mountain bikes."
3,Cheap Mounting Screws Racor B-1R Solo Vertical Bike Rack,"18 February 2011: Racor B-1R Solo Vertical Bike Rack is designed for installation on walls with wood studs. The instructions are not too bad, but you need to locate wooden studs in you wall or install it on the wooden wall. The main problem is that mounting screws are cheap, strip easily and break-off. You need to buy Two stainless steel screws for this work or use common sheet rock screws, as I end up doing for installation."
3,okay product,"Works good with my road bike, easy to hook tire, On my Mountain bike its a different story, With a larger tire you have to really angle the wheel to get it to hook the tire and just as hard to get the wheel out. Protects the wheel fairly well."
4,Efficient,Very good product. Does exactly what it promises. The rubber tip is worseless as it lasted two days but in reality there is no need for it.
2,Did not fit mountain bike wheels,"Had to purchase an alternate rack, unfortunately. The bike we were hanging was a standard bike, nothing too large but it still didn't fit."
4,Does what it's meant to.,"I use 5 of these racks in a backyard bike shed, offset from each other to allow me to place bikes closer together without hitting handle bars.These racks hold bikes easily, although it could be difficult to lift a heavier bike upright to place it in the rack.Mounting them on the wall was very quick and easy.My one complaint is that the grey rubberized grip that touches the wheel comes off very quickly. All 5 had fallen off within 6 months of regular use. I replaced them with electrical tape to keep the metal from scratching my hubs."
4,Nice,"This is exactly what I needed. Small, does a great job holding the bike up and it's not too cumbersome to get the wheel in and out. The aperture for a bike lock is a great addition."
4,Does the job,"I had no problem installing this bracket on the wall, but I did have an electronic stud finder to help... The only negative is that the rubber on the catch hook does slid off as other people have mentioned. I will be putting some crazy glue on the inside of the rubber sleeve and reinstall, so no biggy."
4,Bike Rack Review,"The Racor bike rack was easy to install and takes up very little space in the garage. It allowed me to get our bikes off the floor and free up floor space. The only downside is that my wife has trouble getting the heavier bikes down off the wall. Also, our ""cruisers"" with the big tires are hard to hang. It would be nice to have a rack with a bigger hook for those bikes with bigger tires."
4,"Good solid rack, easy installation","I agree with the previous reviews that this is a good product. As noted by others, the one weak point of this product is that the wood screws that come with it are a little small for the job. I used some #12 x 2"" pan head screws I had lying around. These fit the rack perfectly and the added length made the job more secure. (The screws that come in the package are 1.5"" long.) I drilled 5/32"" pilot holes into the wall studs and then screwed in the racks.I installed 4 racks side-by-side and offset every other rack by elevating it by 12"" to make sure the handlebars from the bikes cleared each other.The racks feel very solid and all the bikes hung easily from them, including bikes with off road tires.I would happily get these again, if the need arose - but hopefully the manufacturer will consider sturdier screws."
2,"Great idea, but the rubber coating rips after a few uses and bunches up","Nice, clean-looking white bike mount to hang your bike vertically. The product is relatively easy to install and it's nice that there's a plate that covers the screw heads. However, after a few uses, the black rubber coating split in half and bunches up. Frustrating and poorly designed rubber coating!"
5,Excellent...,"Easy to install. Real easy to mount bicycle. Mountain bike tires required me to slide wheel onto the rack at an angle and then straighten the bike out to hang, but otherwise no issue at all. If you intend to install rack on a wall with sheetrock, do yourself a favor a use longer screws. The ones in the box are only 1 1/2"" in length. I bought two of these so far and now that i've used them I'm buying more. Definitely recommended."
4,Very Well Constructed,"The item is solid, however the cover plate is a little loose when the wheel is resting on it. The instructions said to mount the hanger on a stud, however I used two 50lbs drywall anchor screws. So far so good, my bike is only slightly lighter than 40lbs.The white color can get dirty quickly."
5,Just getting started!,"I just love this book! Finally something that makes sense and is easy to do. It's great having the ""all in one"" tablet rather than calculating the vitamin supplements myself and taking 6 different pills! I highly recommend it!"
3,I thought this book was too basic,"The most I got out of this book was exercise, in the sun and then rate your moods. Please- I thought maybe it would get into more foods to eat, to help with the overeating. I wouldnt waste my money.Go to the Library and take it out for free!~"
5,Body Blues-- Holistic science,"I was very pleased to find out that someone has looked at women's health in a holistic fashion. The authors have done their homework and integrated information about exercise, light therapy and vitamin therapy so solve a problem that is pervasive and brings together a whole constellation of symptoms of malaise.The Body Blues book not only is easy to read, but it is based on real verified science-- something one rarely sees in the self-help category. As a scientist myself I especially appreciate this.With the exception of vitamins (which can be bought at any drugstore), all the authors' recommendations can be followed at no cost to the individual. This makes it even more surprizing that the authors have refused to sell or be involved in the sale of the vitamins they recommend.Not only holistic thinkers, but public-minded too. A breath of fresh air."
5,When Your Body Gets the Blues,"This book is a rarity - science-based,yet easy to read, and loaded with helpful examples. Dr. Brown, the author, writes with compassion, and enthusiasm, sharing some of her own experiences with the program she and Jo Robinson devised. It made me wonder how many women might have been misdiagnosed as clinically depressed, and medicated, when only their BODIES were ""blue"". This is a cheerful, inexpensive, and eminently do-able program that makes sense and works. I received a number of inquiries from friends who'd seen my copy of the book, so it's making the rounds now!"
5,Body Blues overview from a Nurse.,"...After reading this book I know we can offer more choices and options for our needed patients. The material is sound and it falls into line with healthy eating, and positive exercise, using more light is the same concept we have been offering to patients for a some time now.My only negative feedback about this book is they do not offer any assistance with light therapy products and devices, or locations to purchase them...I think the authors did a great job with the book. I feel strongly enough about this book, I recommend it to the patients at our hospital for review to help in their recovery."
5,They do not sound like slipknot,"I don't see why they are always compared to Slipknot, to me they sound more like Tool meets Factory 81. The vocals are incredible, they range from violent screaming to beautiful singing. The bass is awesome. The drums are great. Guitar is adequate. Overall this definitely the best album released in 2000."
1,I would rather sell insurance and listen to Yanni,I am completely serious. Music like this makes me want to dry heave and look in the mirror at the same time.
1,"Excuse me, but what is this garbage?","Add another band to the trend metal list. Mudvayne is allready in the same league as Papa Roach, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Korn, P.O.D., and all the other recent bands everyone is jumping on the bandwagon for. If the cookie monster singing isn't enough, the music itself isn't anything not allready done before. They're not exactly geniuses in the songwriting department, but ""Death Blooms"" is an actual good song, and its no surprise it got released as a single. Seeing the makeup and getups that the band members wear makes me laugh a lot too, and what gets me is the kids think that this is hardcore, that this is metal, and it's not, it's all been done before, and done a lot better. Don't believe me?, then go listen to older Slayer or Morbid Angel or Nile and you'll see what I mean. Than again, if you need a coaster to put your drink on, then by all means by this."
4,Signs of things to Come,"The debut album was snatched up by folks looking for more stuff like Slipknot. They found this in ""Under my Skin"" and ""Dig"", but found a gem in ""Death blooms"".Death Blooms was the first song to let people in on the true ""Mudvayne"" sound.""Severed"" showed what promise Chad's voice possessed, and Nothing to (K)now Forever showed the complexity to the sound that was evolving.A great album that foreshadowed the coming of their next album ""The End of All Things to Come"""
1,Loud isn't Talent,"There is nothing progressive about downtuned power chord riffing coupled with ferocious growling. There is nothing metal about clean riffing coupled with emo-reminiscent vocals. And putting the two together is ugly, especially when mixed with several short tracks of irrelevant noise. This in a sense, is LD50.Mudvayne has only mixed up their generic numetal formula with the inclusion of a downtuned slap bassist. This does, without argument, create a clever sound and a bit of a groove, but does little to save the songs. The vocals are either weakly sung, or loudly roared. The lyrics aren't memorable in the slightest. The riffs are unoriginal, no matter how heavy, and the drumming is generic. Dig is the spotlight on this album, but loses its luster by the uninspired songs after it that sound similar. Don't buy this."
1,Posers!,"a band that cant play their instruments. MUDVAYNE! I'll give them credit, because they look cool, but thats it. I love the song DIG, but the rest of the CD sucks. Its either horrible (just pure Noise and screaming and same drum beats), or slow (to slow, slow beat, his voice doesnt get heavy). I thought this was going to be a good buy. examples of Horrible are Internal Primates Forever, Under My Skin, Know Forever, Nothing to Gein. Examples of Slow, -1, Prod, Pharmaecopia, Severed, Cradle. The only songs i actually liked are Death Blooms, Dig, and Severed. The rest is crap. Trust me, if you like Korn, LInkin Park, Slipknot, Papa Roach, Deftones, You wont really like this. Dont get it to look cool either."
4,Great debut,"Mudvayne shows its interesting style on their major label debut (though this isn't their first album). They share a distinct likeness with Slipknot (not surprising since Shawn from Slipknot is an executive producer for the album), Deftones, and Tool. Lyrically, Mudvayne brings a different type of message, something that is not found in many of the bands out there today. Overall, this is a great start for a band beginning in the short-attention span of the nu-metal scene."
5,Wow...,"I only listen to a handful of NuMetal...and I tell you what...this is by far one of the best CD's I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. The song ""Dig"" hardly gets old and I often find myself singing it over and over again in my head. Even being a person more fond of the harder stuff like Lamb of God and Slayer this is just awesome. I definitely reccommend this CD to anybody who likes any type of metal."
4,MuDvAyNe RULES!!,"THIS BAND HAS THE HONOR TO BE PLACED AS ONE OF THE BEST NU-METAL BANDS OF ALL TIME. YOU CAN HEAR HOW TALENTED THEY ARE ON EACH AND EVERY SONG. I HAVE EXPERIENCED GREAT MUSIC AFTER LISTENING TO L.D 50. THESE GUYS OPEN SO MANY DOORS IN MY HEAD, IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN. I SENSE THE MESSAGES THEY TRY TO DELIVER TO ANYONE THAT DEARES TO LISTEN TO THEM. MUDVAYNE AT FIRST SEEMED SO DULL AND BORING, BUT I KNEW I HAD JUST PURCHASED NOT JUST A HEAVY CD; A LINK TO LIFE OVERCOMING DEATH. SUBLIMINAL IT IS. EVERY INDIVIDUAL THAT AGREES THAT THIS BAND STANDS ON TOP OF THE WORLD LET'S CHAT..."
5,Tons Of Talent!,"I'm not going to get into the fact that they sound nothing like Slipknot and are not ripoffs, because anybody who has heard one song from this cd knows that they dont. They only have 4 people, none of them wear masks, and there sound is completely different. So, moving on... this band has some real hardcore tracks on top of some mellower tunes, which makes this album so great. Buy it today!"
1,for some reason people pay more attention to - reviews,"having bought this cd after hearing dig on the radio, i was expecting a cd full of songs like dig. i was wrong, none of the other songs sound like dig, which is a good thing because i hate dig now (too much airplay hint..hint..). Being a bassist myself the first thing i was attracted to was the bass lines in the songs. they were absolutely incredible, he has so much talent and is not afraid to make the music more interesting by using slap and pop lines kinda red hot chillipeppers style. the songs themselves are nice to listen to, they are well arranged and the time changes make them interesting to listen to. the only con to this disk would be the filler tracks which seem to be ripped off of a tool cd, but tool at least has something to it's fillers. overall great! hasn't left my cd player."
2,Too Overated,"These guys are all gimmick now. they used to be good. But now that they have frickin 2 videos, a DVD!, their own frickin monster truck, and are well on their way to having way to many t-shirts (like Slipknot). dont listen to all the good stuff. People that like them because they heard dig, arent real true fans, like the ones that bought it the day it was released, and followed the band mature. Instead of helping it become more hated by underground music listeners (because EVERYONE knows about them). call me a sellout hater, but in my book, that isnt kewl. If u rely on MTV so sell your records, and millions of screaming fans that dont know the first thing about heavy music (just that slipknot is kewl, korn rocks, limpbizkit is in da' house, and coal chamber is underground).lol."
5,best metal album of 2000!,"if you're ANY kind of metal fan who REALLY enjoys brilliant, well arranged music - you've found it. this could be the best metal album ever made. its packs the brilliantness of tool with the mayhem of slipknot. this guitar-driven album is packed with wicked slap bass and percussive-assault, along with brutal vocals accompanied by soft, high-pitched vocals. if you like system of a down, tool, deftones, pretty much ANYONE, you're going to like mudvayne"
2,Okay. Im not impressed,"I like the song Dig from a while ago, and i do mean a while ago (october). So i got the CD then. I liked it, but not enough. I only liked 5 songs of the 12. They were Dig, Severed, Pharmaecopie, Everything and Nothing, Death Blooms, and Negative One. Plus their is also like 5 filler songs which make the album drag on, although, some songs fall right into the next. If you like Dig, i wouldnt buy this album right now, i'd go with Slipknot, Spineshank, Nothingface, or Machine Head."
3,Slipknot/Tool,"Mudvayne is a mixture of Tool and Slipknot. From there long and unpredictable songs to there often gruff but sometime beautiful music. This is definately not a dance cd, the beats change so often that its hard to know when song song ends and another begins. Its not a ""sit-down and listen"" cd either. This cd will make you want to get up and move around. Real good driving music. They come so close to being rip-offs of Slipknot but they aren't, they pull back just a hair and throw some Tool into there music which makes for a ineresting music experience. All and all, the cds not that bad but its not that great either."
2,WAY OVER RATED,A few good songs..dig and l.d 50..the rest are [garbage]..most of the songs are just pointless screaming with no direction...kud ( the lead singer) does have a voice on him..but the majority of the songs just have no structure..
3,Please don't compare them to Slipknot,"The first song I ever heard by Mudvayne was Death Blooms. A few months ago, I heard Dig for the first time. I really liked the sound of Dig, but was pretty surprised when I listened to LD 50. One thing I don't like about the cd are the 5 filler tracks(monolith, golden ratio, lethal dosage...you know what I'm talking about). I really like the guitars in 1. Internal Primates Forever is a pretty good song, but I didn't expect to hear Kud singing and even (gasp!) almost rapping. Some other cool songs to check out are Cradle, Everything and Nothing, Severed, and Prod. All in all, this was a slightly above average cd of the nu-metal genre."
4,THE REIGN OF MATH METAL!!!!,"""LETHAL DOSAGE 50"" is MUDVAYNE'S debut album... this album is great... it has a lot of good tracks, like DIG, CRADLE, PROD, DEATH BLOOMS, -1, NOTHING TO GEIN AND PHARMAECOPIA, but it has also fillers which is very annoying, makes you want to push the next button... anyway it's DEFINITELY a good buy..."
5,Good Nu-Metal?,"Yes, reader there is such a thing. Unlike many nu-metal bands, Mudvayne's members are talneted and don't have their songs played every 5 minutes. To Geezer ""Geez"", if you REALLY listened to the album, you'll know that Kud is a great singer, just listen to ""-1"" and tell me he constantly screams! Yeah, Mudvayne rules! Best songs- Dig, Death Blooms, Iternal Primates Forever, -1"
1,How can you give this 5 stars?,"Only the Limp Bizkit Korn Posers can actually give this band 5 stars. Because they saw them on MTV. WOW. I bought this a while ago and its horrible. The singer should be in another band, instead of this one. If you people can see, its a 3 1/2 star rating. I still dont see why this is selling good though. If you want to look cool, it wont make you, because everyone already has this CD. I guess the first real 4 songs are the ones that set the mood. The CD is weird, not heavy. If you think its heavy, download Prod, Cradle, or Everything and Nothing. The only songs that are good are -1, Dig, and Severed. The rest is either a filler track (1,6,9,12,17), or a dull, noisy song. With that said, most songs are just screaming, loud guitar, and amplified bass. No musical talent whatsoever. Another MTV sellout band that's going nowhere."
3,Something seems to be missing...,"Mudvayne has talent thats not even questionable, but L.D.50 seems a bit unpolished for my tastes. Their songs range from brutal to ballad like. Some great potential for these guys but they need a better overall feels, it seems almost rushed. Good songs are Dig and Prod."
1,No comment....its just bad,"Well, i bought this because of Dig, but it turns out to be the only descent song. the rest is weird. Its almost gothic. Some songs are fast, but songs like Everything and Nothing, -1, Cradle, and nothing to gein makes this a waste of money.Please, dont buy this. It's not good.Get someSnot Glassjaw Hatebreed ( real heavy) Machine Head"
2,In response to Ashton,"Just because they play ""math metal"" like Tool does doesn't make them the master musicians that Tool is. Dream Theater also uses mathematical signature changes and I don't see any comparisons. I'll admit that the bass player is good, but as for the other musicians... well, they aren't the ""best"" as you claim. Check out Peter Lingrine (sp? sorry) and Mikael Akerfeld from Opeth for two amazing guitarists, and Slayers Kerry King for another amazing guitarist, Slayers Tom Araya for a better screamer, and Slayers Dave Lombardo for a better drumber."
1,Technically impaired progressive mock,"Sad is the day when the only requirement needed to be considered technical metal is simply stating, ""We are a technical metal band"". This ""music"" is about as progressive as Limp Bizkit in reverse. To me, this band depicts a failed attempt at the once unique sound of such bands as Meshuggah, Dillinger Escape Plan (who, contrary to what Mudavayne claims in various interviews, coined the term ""Math Metal"", and fit this description much better), and Strapping Young Lad. The band arrogantly compares themselves to the like of Frederik Thordendal (Lead guitarist and songwriter of Meshuggah, for the metal-ly challenged). Fred could wipe his a$$ and pull off more talent than this."
3,Not as annoying as I expected,"When I first heard Dig on the radio, I was very disturbed. KUD wouldn't stop cussing and so forth. But when I gave this a try I changed my mind. There's sometimes where it sounds like Nonpoint (Death Blooms) and where it's exactally nu-metal (-1). Get it and be shocked."
5,"Very good, original CD","Incredible vocals, beats Slipknot IOWA into the ground and gives self titled a run for its money. My favorite song on here is death blooms, especially the end. They remind me of a mix between KoRn's life is peachy and slipknot self titled. Go buy it right now."
5,Forget the reviews that say Mu Dv Ay Ne is like SlipKnot.,"Forget the reviews that say Mudvayne is like Slipknot. Mudvayne is somewhat like Slipknot but not as much as people said they were when the album was first reviewed. Mudvayne is the best metal band that has come out in quite a while. Their bassist is one of the best i've ever seen in front of my eyes. The song ""Dig"" is the best way to start out an album with this much intensity and emotion worked into it. If you don't have, buy it. If you like Slipknot (and I know many of you do) you'll be blown away by this one. And go see them live. It's better than the album."
4,Mudvayne is like no other....,"This is a great debut cd of a metal based band that sounds like nothing else out there. I mean, sure...you can hear the Slipknot if you try, and other new metal in it if you really want to, but these guys are a new breed. Their songs pretty much all have the low tuned guitars and angry vocals, but they put a high level of technicality in their songs. Many of them have odd time signatures and a bunch of tempo shifts. The only thing that brought this cd down for me was all of the little minute long breaks on the cd. I just think that they could be taken out and it would flow much better. But the vox are great and the music blew me away when I heard it. They are definately gonna be around for a while, and I can't wait to hear some of their stuff after it's matured a bit."
5,More talented than Slipknot,"For the past year I have been looking for a CD that really holds true to the roots of Metal. I FOUND IT!!!!! MuDvAyNe Tears everything apart (this includes all of that RAP METAL that is everywhere) with their powerful sound. It's not as insane as Slipnkot, but nowhere near as sloe as Taproot. Please look into this CD."
1,Dire,"More hyped up nu-metal with little style yet even less substance. This band are obviously being touted as the next Slipknot, but where as Slipknot backed up their laughable image with some of the fastest and aggressive nu-metal around, Mudvayne just churn out familiar riffs and unoriginal songs. Mudvayne are just a boy-band for metalheads and the music on L.D. 50 is just as weak, formulaic and easily marketable as your standard pop band. `Dig' is the closest to being a decent song but the rest of the album is just bland and, surprisingly, inoffensive. Don't believe the hype."
1,Little child has a temper tantrum,An hour of some guy screaming into a microphone backed by wimpy Gwar wanna bees.The only artistic redemption is that it 'moves' me to turn it off.
1,HAHAHAHAHAHA the WORST piece of SH*T I've ever listened to!!,"This band.. it's SOOOO bad that makes me laught, ohhh NO musical direction , just garbage all the time, the lirycs are TERRIBLE, the instrumentals are even worst and the vocal line are the same with the instruments... maybe the WORST cd ever made... absolutely terrible band and garbage (cd), It's hard to believe that someone support this mindless garbage."
4,very very good band,This band is a very good one. i saw them live and was surprised. they have an enerjenic and powerful sound but they are very straight forward and easy to catch onto. this is a very good cd. buy it!
3,Different from current Mudvayne,"I bought this album because I really enjoyed Mudvayne's 2008 album, The New Game. But L.D. 50 is very different music, stylistically. It's much less melodic and mainstream than The New Game...to me it's much harder to listen to. I like listening to The New Game when I'm running and lifting, but L.D. 50 just isn't working for me. It's not to say it's bad music, it's just not my taste. And it's definitely different than the current Mudvayne. However, I want to listen to it more...I'm hoping it will grow on me."
3,"Not bad , not bad at all","Frist off,this sounds nothing like Slipknot,o.k, the songs dig and internal primates forever (tracs two and three)do but the rest don't. The singer Kud has a good volcal range form pretty good singing to kick a$$ screeming ang the lyrics are good too. The problem is their gitar is kinda sh**ty. It's also really dark and slow which is cool but you con't really mosh or get pumped to it. I don't like the way they mix the tecno and metal sounds together. It's really chappy and gets annoying.bands like Ultraspank and Static X do a better job."
4,"Not a debut, but that don't matter! Still Excellent!","Mudvayne brings together an edgey mix of grind metal and lyrics that can only described as smooth. They take the style Slipknot started and flip it around and make it sound so much better. Some of the best songs are ""Dig"", ""-1"", ""Cradle"", ""Nothing to gein"", and ""everything and nothing."" While this isn't thier debut album it certainly is getting them the attention they deserve. The other album, ""kill, i bought"" is pretty good from what I hear."
4,Great!,"Very heavy, different sounding then all of the nu-metal clones. The best rhythym section in metal. An album that actually grows on you and gets better the more you hear it!"
5,Real Death Metal,"I love this CD, it is excellent, filled with great screaming and singing mixed, every single song is full of what Mudvayne does best. My favorite song on this CD has to be Cradle, it is slow at the beginning and blows up with awesome verses. A must buy!"
4,About 4.5 Stars - Mudvayne's Greatest Album,"This album is somewhat heavy in some parts and emo in others. In songs like Death Blooms, there's both. Even though lots of people say that these guys are just like every other nu-metal band, THEY ARENT."
1,slipknot (....)!,"This band is not original, they sound like a watered down version of slipknot. This would not necessarily be a bad thing if this album was done better. The songs are written almost lyrically like slipknot, they sound exactly like slipknot, they even look like slipknot, but lack the punch and direction of slipknot. Another problem is the songs last a tad bit too long. This would not be a problem if their songs actually had focus which they don't. At times even their best songs fizzle toward the middle or end and become flat and boring. They are good at times with initial leadins though. My suggestion buy slipknot not this. These guys could have potential if they changed their focus and tried to be original and tried to create music of their own. Avoid this album or download it from (....) This is my advice to all, take it or leave it."
1,"If this is Music, then Videodrone is the best band","god, i have never heard something more horrible than this. This has no effort put into it whatsoever. It's just another Emo-rap metal influenced band. This has no originality since Primer 55.spend money onSnot Machine Head Crazy Town SlipKnot Orgy gODHEAD Soulfly (if you like Slipknot)Dig is the only descent song on this CD. But the rest are all kinda slow and dark. Definetaly not for moshing."
4,"Metal mastery, but not as good as ""The End of All Things...""","Mudvayne show that they are metal gods on this album and it's pretty badass. There are some pretty good songs too, but personally I'd have to say that they have reached a new level on their newest album. On the newest album they're stronger on song writing and weaker on showing off."
3,"Great start, they've got a lot of work ahead of them","Mudvayne have entered the metal scene with a great deal of hype, and as such have recieved a lot of success. They deserved this, but nonetheless, they aren't the cream of the crop. Mudvayne's songs are too devoid of the greatest things in metal:speed, darkness, and ultimately, the high-pitch ravings of a deep voice. There are plenty of good songs, though. Other than the poor excuse for one, Dig. Well, you're probably gonna buy this anyway. So go ahead. Buy it...but Linkin Park are much better of a new band(for bands that don't sound the same, they are much darker)"
2,Slipknot's better,"I bought this CD after downloading Death Blooms. That song has a good contrast between beautiful singing and hardcore screaming that I admire in bands like Deftones, System of a Down, and Nothingface, so I naturaly loved it, and got LD50.What a waste of money. Mudvayne is like Slipknot, but not as aggressive, which is its downfall. While listening to Slipknot, I can feel the intensity of Cory's vocals, and the intensity of the band combining to form the ultimate angry album. This is just long, drawn out songs that have no real energy, except for Cradle and Death Blooms. Yes, there is melody, but there is too much pointless screaming to make it sound worthwhile. Mudvayne has nothing Slipknot doens't have in heaviness, and is inferior to Nothingface in the soft department.Instead of buying this, download Death Blooms and Cradle. If you need a CD like this, get Violence by Nothingface, or System of a Down's self-titled album. Those are two great metal albums that I enjoy listening to."
2,Mudvayne.........hmmm...,"I thought this cd was very weird. I like alot of the songs on this cd but some were just weird and boring. The best songs are ""Dig"", ""Prod"", and ""Death Blooms."" The band members are really freaky and look cool....but I hate their name. Alot of people say that Mudvayne is a Slipknot wannabe band but they are not, at times they do sound like slipknot....well...actually only in dig....everything else sounds very different. I say that if you dont have anything else to buy then buy this but dont make it a ""must buy""....alot of songs just are too weird..."
4,Good Mainstream Metal on the way from mudvayne,"If you are into all the new mainstream metal bands out there (slipknot, korn, linkin park, etc.) will love this album. This band blows every other nu-metal band out of the water. With a crazy lead singer, pounding double bass from the drums, strange guitar and bass riffs, you will be screaming for more. Check out songs like -1, death blooms, dig, and cradle and you will know what i mean. Mudvayne is often compared to slipknot, but after listening to this record, slipknot should be compared to mudvayne. ROCK ON!"
1,I cant really get into these guys,"these guys are pure noise. they rip off of Tool and Slipknot. Okay. Call these guys original? wtf? Then, i see them on mTV, okay, now everyone likes them. Bad. Whats a good song? Dig, because its the only one you've heard and you dont know a thing about music. So you buy the CD so it makes you look cool, only problem, when everyone has it, its WONT make you look cool. Its horrible. Dig is nice and fast. the only songs that are actually in the style of Dig are Internal Primates Forever, and Under My Skin. The rest is slow, and copying off tool. Songs like Prod, Everything and Nothing, Cradle suck. and not to mention 5 of the tracks are fillers. Bad CD, save your money for Spineshank. A great up coming band."
1,Not as great as I hoped,"I saw these guys live last year with Slipknot and Dope, and i was impressed. Highly. They played Dig, Internal Primates Forever, -1, Under My Skin, and Cradle. I bought the CD and i found that the only good songs were Dig, Internal Primates Forever, Death Blooms, Severed, and Know Forever. The rest didn't live up to the live versions. Also, i hoped this band would have been harder. That way, this CD wouldnt be bought by a bunch of Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit posers. Who will later, put them on TRL, and make all the original fans of this band get mad because they sold out. So, actually, i like this band a lot, just dont make them sound so good, because then EVERYONE, (including Carson Daly) will want a piece of them. And we dont want these guys becoming sellout now do we?Back to the CD. It was ""horrible"" *wink Wink*.and yes, i bought this before the Dig video on ""MTV2"". More like October."
5,Metal at its best.,"This is metal how it always shoud've been: creative, relentless, and powerful. Its a shame that this group's later efforts have fallen short of the incredible standards they set on this record.5 of 5, incredible."
4,A Cut Above The Rest,"I know there are a lot of metalheads out there who dispise nu-metal and only like the real stuff. Personally, I don't care what kind of metal it is as long as its good. I agree that many nu metal bands out there do kinda suck because they're too simple. This one, however, is the good kind of nu metal. It is a cut above the nu metal bands that are ridiculed most (they are a hell of a lot better than Linkin Park). They have talent without a doubt, and it shows very quickly. Dig is a really awesome song, and even so it is still definately not the best one. I like all of the actual songs a lot (I find the interludes boring, the CD could do without them). This is a great album, regardless of what type of metal it is. 4 and a half stars."
4,Space between a blink and a tear......,"I would have to say that Mudvayne is one of my guilty pleasures. I love putting this CD on when working out or running...gets me pumped. I have never heard a band with such hard and grinding guitars and yet the lead singer can switch from an all out scream to a ""maynardesque"" harmony. Mudvayne is not for everyone. I am not a big fan of Slipknot and these guys are often and unfairly compared to them. Let me just say that Mudvayne is a much better band and is nothing like slipknot except they are in the same genre of music."
2,Could have had a better CD to match the live show,"I saw them with Slipknot and Dope a while ago, i loved them. But still, i liked every song they played, including Death Blooms, Internal Primates Forever, -1, Under My Skin, Cradle. So i got it as soon as it came out. I was a little dissapointed. The only songs that actually sounded good wereInternal Primates Forever, -1, and uNder my SkiN. The rest was bad. Dig is all screaming, and could have been a little bit more melodic. If they try harder for the next CD, i might see them again. If you like Dig, this isnt the CD to get. Get Slipknot or Spineshank instead."
1,It's all been done before,"It's all been done before. This is just another group trying to cash in on the recent outbreak of bands that like to wear makeup. They may seem or even act like they are original, but they aren't. It's worthless. I know the geeks and outcasts at school will love this and rave about its originality and how great it is, but really it's just proving that they don't even know what they are listening to. It's the same old thing over and over. What was started by Marlyin Manson, Metallica, and the other hardcore originals will be ended by these copies of copies of copies."
1,"If you like SlipKnot, dont get this","/i dont have anything against these guys, but i just dont like this CD. These guys look cool, but they can't make a decent song. The only good songs on this are -1, and Dig. Download the songs, it will save you money. People say they are like SlipKnot, they really arent. They are far from. They sorta have a Static-X meets Primus type sound. But its not great. They just play Drums really fast, and theirs way too much Bass. Listen to Monolith, or Internal Primates Forever, especially #3. It's a very bad song. So dont buy this, just borrow it from a friend, or download -1, and Dig."
1,no talent,"simply, worthless music. Bands like Deftones, Tool, and even Slipknot know how to make music. These guys literally put (seriously) 3 guitar notes into a riff, Play drums fast, and scream really loud.Its Static-X gone bad."
1,The Beatles are better than this,"I seriously dont like this. Dig is okay, but if you like them because of the Dig video, dont get this.Its horrible. Its got 2 good songs. #3, and #2. What do you know. Only at the beginning. This isn't a copy of SlipKnot. Its a bunch of crap put onto a CD.Spend your money on Machine Head Liguid Gang, Nickelback, and even Sevendust.So you like Spineshank, Slaves, and Taproot. But atleast they got talent."
2,Dig is a good song but...,"Well, i got this cd...and it's really not that good. I just cant get into the album and listen through it. People have said they are the best band of the year...but i dont agree. It looks like the Tool aspect of this has already been covered but i'll do it anyway. Tool is the BEST BAND. If you dont have their cd's make sure you get them, because they'll be your favorite band after you hear a couple songs. Umm dont buy this cd, it's not worth it. Nothingface is an excellent band, they ARE worth listening to, better than mudvayne."
1,Marked,The book has many marks in it. I hoped that it was just pencil and I could just erase it but much of it is in pen. I will have to buy another one.
1,very temperary,"I bought this same product at target for $5. It was a so-so item for a little while, and I knew not to turn the volume too loud; but even though I took care of the product,it only lasted a very short time before it wouldn't work at all. Not a good buy."
1,False advertisement,"The tape measure I received isjunk.It does not stand out to 9' like advertised ,and is very flimsy.It's junk.You ought to send me a full refund for both tape measures I ordered ,and issue an apology."
3,Plastic Jesus,It was fine for what it was. You can immediately tell it is influenced by the Beatles which are as always amazing.
3,Homage to the Beatles,"Poppy Brite's novella Plastic Jesus is her homage to the Beatles and the culture of the 1960's. It is not, however, about the Beatles. Make no mistake there are simalarities but Seth and Peyton are not John and Paul. Brite uses the love story between the two founders of the group to explore issues of prejudice and acceptance.Peyton grows as a character by reflecting on his life as a member of the most important rock group of the decade. In doing so he must also reflect upon his life in general, the issues of fame, and finally his ability to go on after a startling tragedy.This is not profound reading but the book makes some interesting points."
2,NOT a good Poppy book,"I'll start by saying that I love her work. I'm not gay, never interested in gay fiction whose only distinction lies gay themes, but her writing superlatively defines a voice in horror that is distinct and unique. I like her stuff.But Plastic Jesus (Amazon couldn't obtain it for me, a website had a signed copy sent to me within a week) was just not good. For the first time, her writing strayed into that '...only distinction' zone and I was left asking, ""so what?""Now, I'm a Beatles fan, but if John and Paul were lovers, I'll leave you with the same question : So what?"
3,Qualms,"I found the book to be quite informative, however there is one problem that I found. The reader/rider can only do the tour in the direction in which the tours take place in the book due to the fact that the directions are given one way. I just finished a tour using this book and thought that I may be able to maneuver from the end of a tour and go toward the beginning with the help of some good maps. If I had a one Euro cent for every time I got lost I would have been Trump by the end of the trip. I did a tour in the U.S. with maps and directions that went both directions... north AS WELL AS south and east AS WELL AS west. The directions are impossible to follow unless you are going in the Whitehill's prescribed direction. Aside from that, information regarding campgrounds and distances is extremely on target and helpful."
4,Best Flat Iron. Minus 1 star for longevity.,"This is my favorite flat iron. I have had 2 and am on to my 3rd now. The reason it's not 5 stars is because (like the other reviewers say) it only lasts 1-2 years max. I had each for that period of time and towards the end, it just isn't reliable. I would plug it in, and it would lose it's connection. After my 2nd HAI, I got tired of the problem and tried to switch I got theFHI Heat Platform 1 Inch Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Styling Iron with Nano-Fuzeion TechnologyI have been disappointed with that flat iron from day 1. I am now heading back to the HAI.Buy a HAI. Enjoy it for 18 months. Consider each additional day as a gift from the hair straightening gods."
4,No Complaints,"It is definitely one of the best hair straighteners I have ever had, not the best I have ever used though. I would recommend it because for the price I got it for it was well worth it."
1,What?,"This is the worst music i have ever heard. anybody who compares these yelling kids to the great old school rappers is an idiot. go waste your money and get this album, its great at causing migraines.its a good record if you have no musical taste whatsoever."
1,A wolf ain't the word,"African-Americans have come along way from the days where we were called all sort of names that dehumanized us. Now here comes the underground black people with words that were buried and now resurrected again. The artist of this cd needs to read the Scriptures because YHWH says we are wonderfully and fearfully made, we are not animals, but was given dominion to rule animals. We were made in the image of YHWH so how could we be m...........f.....? It's a shame so many are LOST and can't find their way back home."
5,One of the ABSOLUTE classics from the underground. Disagree? then disappear!,"Yes, even though ""Flavor of the Month"" made some waves and ""The Choice is Yours"" is murdered at countless parties under counltess sampling and remixes, the majority of this record was made for the heads to bump as they ride around in a cloud-filled Pathfinder. It is a lesson in sampling. There are layers upon layers that mash jazz and disco in an ingenious way. None of that SWIZZ Beats or Kanye nonsense. No puffy jackmoves, either. Dres and Lawnge are charismatic womanizers that blend perfectly with beats that could double as a p0rn0 soundtrack. I got this record in 1991, when it came out. I have thus worn out six CD copies since then. The only way this album could be any better is if they include all the insane remixes they made for the singles. If you ain't possessin' this fly hi-fi compilation, you are a straight up nerd."
4,Laidback rhymes and music - several classic cuts here,I bought this when it first came out and only started listening to it again frequently and it still sounds fresh compared to some other early rap albums i've bought. the lyrics are nothing clever but these two guys can rhyme well and the music is just right for kicking back and relaxing. You won't find any macho posturing or political musings on this (not much anyway)but don't let that put you off. This album features several great cuts although it is maybe a little long at 22 tracks.
5,You can get with this or you can get with that!!!,"This cd is the bomb!! It takes me back to the real hip hop days. Be aware of the Explicit Dirty Lyrics, It's hot and out of pocket fun. Yo, this cd is the truth. Get it now u won't regret it.!!!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"When ""The Choice Is Yours"" came out, I was in second grade, and growing up in Stamford,CT which picked up all of the NYC stations. Naturally, I loved the song, but it isn't until now, my junior year in high school, that I have learned to respect and appreciate East Coast Rap at it's best (era 89-91). I was listening to my radio at sonicnet.com and I was able to hear more and more songs from their first debut cd, along with others I haven't heard. My favorite is ""Strobelite Honey"". I am probably one of the youngest people to review this cd, but because my musical preferences have always been of East Coast music and its style, Black Sheep is definitely a must have."
3,Pretty Good,"This one started out pretty good, I just thought that it kind of slowed down in the middle of the series and then it picked back up toward the ending."
5,Season 3,"24 Season 3 is a great roller coaster ride!! Don't leave the room for a second or you'll miss something important. Kiefer is stellar, as usual. Carlos and the rest of the cast are priceless. They draw you into the story, even more when you think you know what's going to happen. There are many new faces this season and they do their parts to fill out the story with emotion and drama. The commentaries alone are worth the price of the box set. I purchased a USED box set, but it looks and plays as new. Season 3 is well worth the money either way."
2,I'm really busy right now so I'm haging up,"This show is dumbed-down tripe. The 24 hour time frame is a clever twist, but the ludicrous plot twists, inane tactics, and stiff soap opera characters are too much to stomach. From the babysitter turned top level analyst to the absurdly scripted presidential ex-wife one is forced to suspend all intelligence at the door and the repetitious suspense payoffs are just not worth it. The manner in which CTU is run defies belief - spouses and offspring working side by side, constantly understaffed with employees seemingly unaccustomed to stress, oafish security just waiting to be tasered and an endless stream of myopic bureaucratic bosses hell bent on hamstringing the field operatives. Since when does the ability to shout qualify you as an actor?Frightening indictment of our society that this show was so popular. Save your money."
4,"Still Good, But This Season Slipped","Much like Alias, 24 slipped in it's third season (2003-2004). Both set themselves up with a challenging plot line and didn't plan their story arcs out ahead of time. In the commentary for 1 a.m.--2 a.m. in this set, the producer explains that, ""for the third season we were behind on every single episode, stilling writing it while it was in pre-production and even shooting. We just had a vague idea where we were going in the next few episodes.""This is the root of all the problems; continuity issues, random twists, and a slow first half.I must say though, the second half is quite good-- and if you ignore a few issues-- contains some of the best episodes of the entire series. Michelle's hotel storyline comes to mind as the best of the season."
1,Never buy from this company!,I ordered from this company they had very good reviews. When my DVD never came I went back and read some more reviews and nobody is getting what they ordered.Stay away from them!They also failed to respond to any of my emails. Ver frustrating!
4,"One of the best Dramas, not the best season","24 is one of the best dramas in television now, a very good plot, all the right elements (intrige, action, drama), and of course superb perfomances.But Season three has not the same pace as the first and second season, the first half is a little boring (except for the 4 first hours), the threat is too personal and not in a very wide scope.The second half improves when the treath becomes quite clear and the mayority of the caracthers have to do very dificult decisions, old grudges become a mayor part of the plot and the conflicts are resolved, of course new conflicts arise for season 4, for until then we will have to wait for them to develop.In conclusion, is a very good Drama, but not the best of the season, lets hope that Season 4 could improve just a little bit."
4,"Entertaining, but not perfect","This season was entertaining and compelling viewing. Chase and Chloe were interesting new additions. I am so glad Sherrie Palmer and Nina were killed off. They were getting old. Will miss President Palmer next season, although his story lines weren't the best this year. With Tony in jail and Chapelle killed (by Jack), next year will offer almost a totally new cast. I think this is a good thing and might reinvigorate the series."
4,"Great show, but realize that....","The republican from Dallas doesn't realize that this is a Republican show. It's pro-Bush and propaganda. He should be FOR this show!Like I said, it's a great show but it is on Republican TV (Fox) and it depicts terrorists as if they really were sophisticated with CIA type technology and resources. Why? Because as long at American's really believe terrorism is that much of a threat (it's not) then they will continue to be afraid and that is how fascist governments rule their citizens -- with terror. Bush and his cronies will continue to get away with their attack on our freedoms and their imperialistic wars for oil as long as Ameicans believe their terror propaganda.Enjoy the show, but don't believe ANY of it. The so-called terrorists don't have all those 007 toys and technology. They got lucky once. That's all. If you want something to fear, fear the USA's current administration's war on your rights and their goal of world domination."
2,Worst season yet--I _will_not_ be watching season 4,"Though this series had an excellent beginning, it has been going steadily downhill with each passing season. I stopped watching about mid-season (SPOILER: Jack and Sandobar had just been outbid in negotiations to buy the biological weapon). I gave up because the last five or six major plot twists required that someone in the cast do something UNBELIEVABLY STUPID and unprofessional to bring it to that point. If, during such a crisis, the fate of our nation is in the hands of such a group of emotionally friable nimrods, God help us all. It'd lost so much credibility that it became unwatchable.As I stated in the title, I won't waste my time on season 4. I gave it 2 stars because, as always, it did have excellent production values."
1,"Glorifying torture, murder, and plain ole bad decision-making","I found Series 3 to be *extra shocking* in its cavalier disregard for human life -- too much torture, too much murdering and just plain ole stupid bad idiotic decision-making from ""higher ups"" who should know better. I felt this series contributes to the ""normalizing"" of abnormal behavior by agents-in-charge who can and will do anything to ""follow orders"" unless, of course, the orders might adversely affect one of their own loved ones -- then it's ""break every rule."" Ridiculous!.............. and damaging to the American pysche..."
1,Bad Service,It took a long to receive my product (over a month). I will never order nor recommend this vendor to anyone... Bad Service!!
4,Shipped to me in error,"The only reason I own this is because a friend used my computer to order this to be shipped to his own vacation home address, and Amazon shipped it to me in error. I could not contact Amazon about this because this was not my order. My friend ended up buying it again in the store while he was on vacation and told me to keep it."
5,"****Word is out: Scarlett Johansson on ""24.""***","Be sure to check out the latest season of 24 becausehollywood beauty Scarlett Johansson(lost intranslation) will be appearing on the next season of the hit TV Show. She will play (i believe) some lady named ""naomi myers."""
4,good stuff,"24 is a classic.Season 3 amps up the stakes, from an entertainment point of view. Still no HD, it was only 2003. Very entertaining nonetheless ."
5,great products,Very good condition and arrived quickly. I work full time and know I can trust the products and sellers from Amazon.com to save me time and always give me the service and quality like. Never a hassle with Amazon.com A company I can trust
5,Got here at the same time as sea.2,Everything looks in really good shape.Thanks for the fast service!The disc's all look ok.Look foward to watching as soonas i see sea.2.ThanksMEB
4,24 - Season Three,An excellent production. My only complaint with this DVD is that the closed caption displays often overlap which means that a lot of dialog is not readable. Seasons One and Two had the same problem. Except for that I would give it a five.
1,More Weird Pricing,"Rating based on the pricing of the slim pack version, not on the show iteself.Season 3 (Slim Pack) = $53.99Season 3 (Non-slim Pack? ) = $34.99So what makes the slim pack worth an extra $19.00. There's no mention I can see of any extras. The same weird pricing existed on Season 2.Buyer Beware(Prices current as of the date of this posting)"
1,Used quality said 'very good'. It was not. Scratches & stains.,DISCs were scratched & stained. It said it was 'very good' it was 'very poor'.We'll never buy used from Amazon.com again.
4,Exactly what I ordered,"This series and show are full of intensity and excitement. Being that they are in Season 8 now, going back to season 3 has been awesome as I forgot alot about the original viewing. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the series, or just like great excitement and on the edge of your seat energy!"
5,"Intensity, Excitement, Unpredictable","Each season gets better, even though you complete a season with the confidence no one can top that one. Each session is a cliff-hanger, making it extremely difficult to wait for the next installment. There is no better way to watch 24 than a weekend marathon. And what a weekend it makes!"
4,Loved it,"decided to watch seasons 1-4 while recording season 5. that way I could catch up sequentially. It was worth it and I have enjoyed it. The show itself is somewhat predictable and not quite as good as all the hype (thus the 4 stars) but it is a good show. If you have watched part of this show and are looking to catch up with the past season, it is worth buying."
5,Would be terrorist take notice Jack Bauer is in town!,"After surviving a crazy season 2, Jack is back! It seems that each season rises to the occasion and only gets better. Season 3 kicks off, Sherry is out of the picture, President Palmer is nearing the end of his first term in office. With the threat of an extremely dangerous terrorist organization, the emotions are running high, and the suspense could not be higher. Get this today and get in on the action!"
5,"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant","I have to say, I'm one of those people that stumbled on the show 24 because I was bored stiff. This got me hooked for the rest of the seasons. The suspense is powerful, the action scenes are spectacular, and the emotional values are at a maximum. Kiefer Sutherland delivers his most superb yet. Nothing is overdone, except maybe the cinematography, but that's just a minor flaw. Watch it if you are obsessed with action and suspense."
5,Great from beginning to end...,"The only thing that's better than owning Season Three of 24... is owning Seasons 1, 2, and 4 as well! This is by far the most compelling television series in recent history. It's an absolute 'must-have' for anyone who appreciates overall greatness."
2,G Mark,"The 3rd season of 24 arrived on time however, the package came damaged. The deadline for return past. The dispute was settled to the satisfaction both parties involved."
5,Super fast shipping!,Product was exactly as described and seller made sure it got to my dad on time for his birthday! Fantastic experience!
4,"The worst of all, but still worth four stars...","24 hit our screens hard with the intense, fast-paced and emotionally charged first season. Its second season forwent a lot of the personal involvement for even more intensity and some truly brilliant plotting.But 24's third season ... at least to begin with, is fairly standard fare when compared with its forebearers. This is a spoiler-free review, so let me just say that 8-10 episodes in the middle are pretty ordinary and uninspriing for 24. However, this series ends with a BANG that rivals and in some ways, surpasses any ending they have done before, so it's all worth it in the end.And a bad season every now and again can be a good thing, because the writers and producers know which pitfalls to avoid now.Let me just say this: 24 season 4 is all the reason you should need to watch season 3!"
5,Been waiting a long time,"I havent got the money to go out and buy it yet, but trust me, i will. Ive been waiting to see the final episode for whats probably around a half a year ever since a thunderstorm came the night of the airing and knocked out the cable :( so ive been patiently waiting to see what actually happens in the end. I saw they had something about 4'th season preview so i guess jack is still alive, i have no idea. All i know is i hate the weather, never comes at a good time :)"
3,A (Re) Mixed Blessing,"Sony's entry in the Now and Totally Hits series is a mixed or should I say remixed blessing. Whereas the Now and (99%) of the Totally Hits series have been the original hits, Sony has decided to throw in some inferior remixes on their outing. So, Destiny's Child, Maxwell and the Jessica Simpson song have been remixed and are sure to remind of you of how much better the original mixes were. There are good tracks here: Blaque, Mary Mary, Madison Avenue and Chicane w/Bryan Adams are great singles. But why did Sony have to include old songs by Lauryn Hill, Shawn Mullins and Ricky Martin? Overall a mixed blessing. Buy it only if you are looking for some good singles from mediocre albums."
5,"More than it seems, as magical as the title","Like Lonesome Dove and Deadwood, Warlock takes the western genre and refuses all the cliches, creating the possibility of actually understanding history in the terms of men, women, their frailties, and the power of the land. It goes beneath the obvious surfaces, reweaves actual history, and adds a level of writing expertise that makes it an American classic along the lines of what Hawthorne does to the Gothic in The Scarlet Letter. I couldn't put it down. In it, you see the roots of McMurtry's work and Deadwood, and even intersections with John Ford. For those who love the Western, you must read it. For those, like Pynchon, who want to groove on characters, sentences and a fictional world made vivid and compelling, check it out. A wonderful, satisfying and heartbreaking read."
4,only the beginning,"Warlock is the first in a trilogy by author Oakley Hall, the second novel in the trilogy being Badlands, followed by Apaches. I was simply awed by the writing of Mr Hall, and the universal human truths he reminds the reader of. I can see that more than a few writers must have read Oakley Hall's novels, most especially Cormac Mccarthy. Warlock was published in 1958, and Badlands was at least 10 yrs later, followed by Apaches, which was at least another decade later. Mr Hall also does the fine Ambrose Bierce series of novels, and with a career spanning 5 decades, he is still underated and underapreciated by the general public. do yourself a favor and discover this most excellent writer."
5,Poetry for teenagers of all ages,"Talking about tipical teenage subjects, but based on his 37 years old experiences, Renato Russo, the powerfull vocals and band leader, still touches our hearts with his honest, poetical and straight-forward lyrics and great sounds of Legio Urbana. This cd is an Unplugged for Brazillian MTV, and it was a big hit despite the fact of the end of Legio, with Renato's death, in 1997 (if I'm not wrong...).Definitely, this is a great way of knowing one of the best bands that Brazil ever had, and noticing that Brazillian music goes far beyond Bossa Nova, in fact, we can rock a lot!!!!"
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I live for music, day in and day out. I bought this product on base because I did not want to spend over $20 and by the end of that day I wish I had spent more on something else. You can barely walk with this item, it skips very easily. I tried it in my backpack, but the motion of my walk was just too much, I ended up having to walk to where I was going with the device in my hand. The volume does not get loud enough with the headsets and if you are using the mini-speakers, make sure there is absolutely no other noise in the room and keep your windows closed, because you can barely hear it. It's worth the price however, and if you are just lying in your bed or sitting on a train or bus, this is good."
2,"Skip, Skip, Skip","I bought this CD player to listen to books on tape while travelling, so sound quality wasn't that important to me. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the sound quality was actually very good. However, this player skips with the tiniest of bumps. It's a great low-cost player IF you can keep it perfectly still."
1,It ruined my 11 yr. old Niece's Birthday,"I had the system shipped to my niece because I wasn't sure if I could make it to her party. I did make it to the party only to find out that gift I had sent her was broken! It played..which I suppose is important...but none of the other functions worked. It wouldn't rewind, or fast forward or even stop! The only thing I could do is play and eject. Talk about a bummer. I will never buy an electronic device from Target.com again. And to top it off, I couldn't return it to Target I have to pay to ship it back and then the Target gods will decide whether or not to send me a refund. I guess I have learned my lesson. If it seems like too good of a deal, it probably is. Always be cautious when they are offering free shipping...maybe they are just trying to get rid of them and hoping people will be too lazy to jump through the hoops to return them when they are broken!!!"
1,This is a piece of junk,I bought this thinking o this is so great its so cheap. When i first got it worked fine but then a month and a half later it would turn on i bought new batteries put them in made sure they were in the right way and it still didnt work.
1,buy another one,this cd player is horrible! don't buy it. ull just be wastin ur money. i got it and it didn't even work. i got another one and same tihng. just go buy a $40-$80 dollar player from sony.
2,British English / Castillian Spanish,"I am a great fan of the grammar books by Raymond Murphy. While this text would have been excellent when I was teaching in Spain, my students from Latin America find it cumbersome. The reason why it is not particularly useful is due to the spelling, word usage and idiomatic phrases of British English. In addition, the use of the Spanish ""Vosotros"" is not used in Latin America. I would love to get my hands on a Standard American English / Latin American Spanish version."
1,Don't buy it,This is not even close to black metal. It has no feeling of darkness to it. Varg might as well be a Christian.
2,Not a great biography,"I remember Bobby Knight when he played (or more accurately warmed the bench) for the great Buckeye teams of the 60-61. The early part of his life was interesting, but after that I found myself skipping much of the book. If your a huge BkB or IU fan and have read no other books on Bobby, you may enjoy the book. I only read the book because I saw it available through a library. Most interesting part of the book was the statement by a neighbor of his when he grew up saying that his 1st wife and he were the most mismatched couple she ever meet after they announced their engagement. Their marriage lasted 22 yrs. That may say a lot about their personalities."
5,"It's a great self-help book, too. . .","You know a book is working when you find yourself laughing and crying over and over, and loving every minute of it. No matter what your age, gender, or musical interests, this cuts right to the heart and soul. There's not much more I can say, except ""Read it -- you won't be sorry."" Thanks, Doc! Luv, Nap"
2,WARNING!!! Read this before buying...,"I bought this book thinking it would at least have some explanations. But no, it just is a picture book showing pictures of the different skeletal structures in the body. Buy this book ONLY if it is required for a class that you are taking on this where a teacher is there to fill in the explanations as it is USELESS without them.If you are a pianist who wants to self-study body mapping to prevent injury and improve your playing, take a look at the far better ""What every Pianist needs to know about the body"" by Thomas Mark (ISBN 1579992064) as it has very detailed descriptions on the movements that you should use and should not use (and also includes pretty much the same pictures as this book does)!"
2,There must be a better book out there,"This book is very cartoony and seems almost like a handout you might get at a seminar or a class. It is not necassarily bad, but it doesn't really give you detailed explanations on what you should do. It is more of an illustrated tour of various Alexander concepts. I am still searching for a good Alexander book, but I haven't found one yet so I can't recommend one, but there must be a better one out there, so try a different book."
2,Just skip this book. Too costly for too little information.,"I took a class centered around Alexander Technique concepts for musicians. This book and ""How to Learn the Alexander Technique: A Manual for Students"" were the two required books for the course. My suggestion is to skip this book. It's essentially a picture book with incredibly weak explanations. I should go into more detail about why this book is weak, but it has been awhile since I have used it and I rarely look through it after my first few experiences reading it. ""How to Learn"" is better overall and the preferred book, but has some seriously poor writing within it. I will leave comments about ""How to Learn"" on that review."
5,"Great, however","it is useless without the ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE.That is why some people love it, some don't.Just knowing the structures won't help if you don't know what to do with that knowledge, and that is where the alexander technique comes.Off course you could just look at an anatomy book instead, that would be great, but it would not be the same. Conable gives valuable observations on the structures that would take an inexperienced observer longer time to see. Not to discourage observing anatomy books, that will invariably add priceless info to your knowledge."
2,Lacking any practical help,"In a nutshell, the book provides a set of musculoskeletal drawings with some elementary-school-level text and tells you that if you are experiencing pain while playing, you may have a problem with your body mapping. Most pages include text that (1) exhorts you to be loose in the joint being discussed and (2) tells you to congratulate yourself if you are. Unfortunately, that's as far as it gets. There's no guidance on how to measure or improve. For that, you're referred elsewhere.I'm not sure of the target audience... Music teachers might find it useful for discussing posture (a ""bad"" word in the book) and relaxation with their students."
5,THE book to read!,"Thre is an old Chinese saying... ""Do not read Romance of the Three Kingdoms when you are old"". the implication is, you will already be very wise from your years, and to read this book then will make you almost superhuman. This book is one of the greatest novels ever written. It is a lesson in human relations, in war, in startegy, in emotion, in man management... it is so many things. Luo Guanzhong deveoted his entire life to writing just this one book, and his careful effort can be felt through the book's emotion. Today its characters are revered as gods and sages in much of the Chinese speaking world."
5,The best book i ever read!,"This is the book you have to read. Honor, glory, fame, courage, you'll see them all in that chef-d'oeuvre. This is truly the best book I have read: so good I read it trice!"
4,Important book for Americans to read.,"As I write this, we are at war in the Balkans. The cost of air strikes and further military actions there will all have to come from extra billions of our tax money--the Pentagon budget already goes to the gigantic weapon systems that Grieder's book pictures so effectively. The U.S. public has little awareness of how our Cold War level defense budgets robs our society of social programs such as good schools and health care. ""Fortress America"" is a rare inside look at how a handful of corporations keep their stranglehold on our society in peace as well as war."
5,BREAK THE IRON TRIANGLE,"Congress must be made to know that this vast military spendingmust be hewn down. The current ""defense"" spending is notabout making us a secure nation but about keeping the corporate welfare hogs...LockMartin, Northrop-Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, and others pacified and happy. Mr. Greider shows us the overall picture of this collision of corporate-military-legislative arena in FORTRESS AMERICA. Is there anyone else out there who feels that $300 billion dollars can be spent somewhere else?"
4,Fortress America: Weapons for yesterday's war.,"The book is ahead of its time. The problems that the book identifies are (somewhat) being addressed by the Army Transformation toward new technology and new types of weapons.If this book reads like the tabloids, then please tell me which newspaper. I'd like to read related facts.A puzzle still remains: How to keep weapon production ready for war without overproducing? Some old weapons are being upgraded or retrofit. However, obsolescence remains a major issue. Parts are really hard to replace when the vendor no longer exists, etc....-Nomadder"
4,Tears Shouldn't Cry Anymore,"In the 1980's, there were so many guilty pleasures that really meant something to each of us in our communities, and nobody showcased that theory better than Tears For Fears. With their blend of Rock, Pop, and a dash of psychology, they climbed all the way to the top.The 1992 Greatest Hits Album, Tears Roll Down, was the very first reflection of Tears For Fears classic songs. The songs are strong and enduring as you could ever expect from them. Each song tells a ""Freudian"" kind of story that still keeps acting like several therapy sessions. From Shout, to Head Over Heels, and their biggest hit, Everybody Wants To Rule The World, each song still as authentic as it was originally released back in the late 80's.Although Tears For Fears never regained their exposure, every song is truly worth the listen to, and that is still no reason to shout."
4,UNDERRATED GROUP,"I got this compilation of hits from the 80's band TEARS FOR FEARS because of the cult movie DONNIE DARKO. I never was a fan of 80s music coming from a background of jazz and classic rock, however the soundtrack of the movie was so musically in gear in what was going on from that time, I thought what the hell,let me pick this up. Upon playing the set, I was totally chagrined with the bouyant hooks and melodies these guys churned out. Mad World is probably the highlight of the set and also the one song that really knocked me out in the movie that warrented me to search this CD out."
4,A Decent Collection Of Well-Crafted Songs,"All in all, this is a worthy greatest hits package. I've never been a real large fan of this group, but I do have to admit that they knew how to write some good songs. ""Advice for the Young at Heart,"" would have to be my favorite song. They should've left off two or three songs on this package though; the songs don't sound like hits and are prosaic. I'd rather give this album three and a half, but since Amazon doesn't allow you to grade that way, I'll give it four. A hits package that shouldn't disappoint."
3,"Good, but ""Shout: the very best of.."" has 5 more hits.","Although this is a very good CD with all the ""Greatest Hits"" unfortunately it only has 12 songs. If you get their other CD called (released in 2001)Shout: The Very Best of Tears for Fearsyou'll not only get these exact same 12 songs but you'll get 5 more, 17 songs total! Get to most bang for your buck."
5,"TEARS ""rule"" down!","This was the hippest band in my teenage years. The first time this album got released, I grabbed it fast and never cared about the outrageous price. I just had to have it and it still works magic on me to this day. The danceable songs get me going on my workouts at the gym. You'll never regret getting this gem."
5,Great CD,I just bought this CD and it's great. It's got wonderful lyrics and well arranged melodies that will reach your soul. I strongly recommend that you buy this CD. It's really good music that should be enjoyed for all eternity.
4,Very good,"I love Tears for Fears. My favorite songs are Sowing the Seeds of Love, Everybody Wants to Rule the World, Shout, Head Over Heels, Mad World, Pale Shelter, and Change. I really don't care for the other songs on the album so that's why I am giving it 4 stars. Very good new wave 80s music."
5,Amazingly speechless.,"There's just a few albums so emotive they can even tarnish my eyes, as I listen to... and this is one of them.Just dimm-off the lights, pump up the volume and let it take you out."
5,"Had it, then lost it, now I'm buying it again...","I bought this CD on a trip to Ireland in the fear that it wouldn't make it to the US. I had it for years, before I lost it to a roomate. I have all the Orzabal/Smith original albums (pre-remastering, non-import), so I didn't really, really need this. But for one thing, Laid So Low is a really cool song. For another, sometimes it's nice to have a greatest hits CD instead of the Hurting on CD, and Songs from the Big Chair on tape, and Seeds of Love on CD... So here I am, to buy it again. I'd recommend the same to anyone who liked the band. Here's hoping for a reunion tour...."
4,No Need To Look Elsewhere...,"Everything worth listening to from this band is on this one disc. Lush vocals and pure 80's synth-pop. A trip down memory lane for some, and great example for others on the soundtrack for a decade of oblivion."
1,well...,All I have to say is: Everybody wants to rule the world. That is THE ONLY song really worth the room this CD takes up on your desk
1,Elementary,"This book reads like it was written by a child. It seems like the author was trying too hard to be scary, and it just didn't work. Maybe someone new to the horror genre would find this one scary, but for anyone who does a lot of reading this one is just elementary. I think I wrote better scary stories when I was 12."
1,Truly awful,"This book stays with you. I'll probably remember it forever. I wish I could say that was because it was so good. But it wins the prize for ""The Worst Book I've Ever Read."" Hands down. This book is unspeakably bad. Poorly written, contrived, awful characterizations, unintentional hilarity...this book has it all. It is a very easy read (it took me all of three hours from start to finish) so if you're looking for a laugh in the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" style, then this is your book. They don't get any worse than this."
4,Nice chairs,"My wife liked these chairs because they fit with the brown wood cabinets and stainless fixtures we have in our kitchen. The chairs are as slick as they look in the pictures. The leather is also conducive to wipe-downs after encounters with eating children. I was a little skeptical of the design - the seat backs appear that they would collapse. But, the chairs are very steady for sitting (at least if you are a sub-200 lbs person). My wife even stood on one to reach a cabinet, although I wold not recommend that."
4,Love the Chairs,"We were shopping for this modern look chair that would go with our rustic wood table for a while. We ordered a few other chairs that where more in our budget but how they say ""you get what you pay for"". This chairs were a little high for our budget but we do not regret the extra money we spend. This chairs are great, very solid and feel very comfortable.Shipping took a few weeks longer then we expected and that is the only reason I will give it 4 stars instead of 5. I guess we are getting spoiled with how fast Amazon is shipping their own products."
4,White Leather Chairs,"I was looking for modern leather chairs to go with a glass table for my kitchen. Searched quite a while and found these Italmodern Grace Leather Chairs. After reading the reviews (which I find very important), I ordered and glad I did. Leather is very durable and chrome legs are very sturdy - good quality for the price. Easy to wipe down if they get soiled. They look great with my table. Ordering was a breeze and arrival time was early. I would recommend these."
3,Angel - 'White Hot' (MCA),"Originally released in 1978,this was Angel's fifth album.Overall,it's decent glam/glitter heavy rock.Always heard that with the RIGHT promotion,Angel could've easily been one of the '70's greats.Guess we'll never really know.Cuts that sort of made me sit up and take some notice were ""Don't Leave Me Lonely"",the Rascal's cover ""Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore"",their ballad ""Flying With Broken Wings(Without You)"" and ""You Could Lose Me"".Could appeal to open-minded fans of Cheap Trick,Status Quo,Kiss and possibly even Aerosmith or Van Halen.Can't go wrong with this title's price,that's for sure."
4,very good new item,this item was what i expected of a new item . and it was good to be notified when it was recieved and shipped .
4,The Best Album From An Otherwise Forgettable Band,"White Hot contains Angel's two most memorable songs--""Got Love If You Want It"" and ""Broken Wings""--both of which I just downloaded on iTunes. Both of these appear on ""Anthology"", Angel's greatest hits CD. White Hot was another in a long list of albums I purchased at yard sales and was worth the price at the time I purchased it, but has lost its nostalgic flare, save for the aforementioned songs. Just as Cinderella will always be remembered for riding Bon Jovi's coattails, Angel will, unfortunately, be remembered for doing the same for KISS."
4,classic white hot band!,Angel was one of the mostunderrated melodic hard rockbands but because of the imagethey were ignored by media &radio because of KISS i think.The music was good but i knowsome people who hated it. Iloved it. This album is oneof the best with a classichard/pop rock sound. Theband was great all beinggreat players. I think morepeople should give them achance and check out thismusic. I would start here.Very very good rock n roll.
2,The reviewers have it right.. stay away,I was given this book as a gift and even after reading these reviews I gave it a shot since I like the premise. I tried to get into it but I just couldnt. The reviewers are right. There is just too much unnecessary round table discussions about useless stuff and it really gets old. Please pass.
4,Novels of Adventure and Archaeology,"David Gibbins' two novels reflect an unusual ability to craft a novel around unfamiliar facts in archaeology and history. He does the serious reader a service by distinguishing in his Author's Note historical fact from literary invention. As an amateur historian, I appreciate this specificity.The characters and their technology in both Atlantis and Crusader Gold are a reasonable means for conveying select bits of history in an entertaining sequence, rather than [by themselves] being the center of drama.Gibbin's description of Atlantis' time, location, and historical contribution in this novel is not unreasonable. The only other work of reason on Atlantis years ago was that of Otto Muck, a geophysicist who approached the topic in a scientific manner looking for geophysical facts as opposed to cultural beliefs.I look forward to Gibbins' next novel."
2,A history lecture trying to be a novel,"This book was a dissapointment to me. While it is full of some unusual theories on a possible Atlantis - and the author certinaly knows his history and archaelogy in depth - I felt like I was being bashed over the head with this information while reading this book. At every junction our good guys stop to have a conversation - in depth - on the possibly history of everything - and they are almost always right.Despite the authors knowledge of the topic he is writing on his characters come across as lacking in depth, and full of cliches to some extent. I found myself hard pushed to finish this novel, and it was somewhat depressing to read the usual formula of a great find in history only see it destroyed."
2,Had high hopes for this...,"... But unfortunately was very disappointed. Supposed to be full of new theories in an exciting story, but reads like Clive Cussler trying to write a history of scuba diving."
3,Dirk Pitt-ish Science,"Yes it is the character Dirk Pitt merged with Tom Clancy's tech speak. To some degree the scientific explainations were necessary for the believability of Atlantis being truly found - but they easily could have been scaled back and still worked. That was not a detractor to me. More of bringing the civilization of Atlantis alive would have been nice, since all the scientific buildup preped you for it. This novel is better than many that I have read even with the pacing slowing down for science explanations. I prefered the main character, Jack Howard over Dirk Pitt anyday everyday. But - the plotting had huge holes in it, believability is stretched beyond reasonable limits, characters were too superhuman in intelligence and unrealistic. The premise here is a great one - if the plotting holes, pacing and believability had been shored up it would have been a contender for DaVinci-esque success."
2,I dunno,"It's a great book if you are looking for theories on Atlantis but it's a pain in the neck if you are an ordinary reader thinking you are reading a great adventure book.It's full of facts, fiction or real and it's chock full of info. Info I wasn't looking for. Therefor is was a drag ploughing through this book only to have the story fold on me as a: ""ooohhhh humanity cannot bear this kind of knowledge"" kinda book.If you are a trivial persuit player: buy it!! If not....Nice to know, but not nice to read."
2,James Bond Archeologist?,"The first chapters are very interesting and educational; the author creates a plausible theory for the existence of Atlantis. However, in later chapters, when the bad guys show up, the story degenerates into a James Bond like script losing the scientific edge that makes the book interesting. The hero performs unrealistic and improbable acts of valor, there is a megalomaniac millionaire, the hero suddenly is an expert helicopter pilot, etc, the only missing element is a hairless cat! For a first book the author shows some promise, but he should work on his plots."
2,Barely Readable,"As a previous reviewer has mentioned, the back cover made this sound like a really great novel, similar to the DaVinci Code. The blurb couldn't have been more wrong! The basic premise of the novel, the mystery of Atlantis, was facinating, but the writing itself was just one page after the other of detailed technical mumbo jumbo. Instead of simply mentioning that a bomb was particularly volatile and had caused an explosion and such and such a submarine, the writer went into detailed description of what the bomb was made of, it's designation, how it created the explosion on the submarine, etc. And page after page was exactly like that. YAWN! The characters were boring, the action a bit contrived.I just kept reading it to find out the total story behind Atlantis."
1,Really wanted to like it but.....,"I really wanted to like this but it was just not very interesting. Other reviewers have said it better than I could but the long and short of it is this book is boring.The thing that really sealed it for me was the phrase ""There was a collective gasp of astonishment."" I hate this phrase, and the auther used it several times thoughout the book, once just a couple of pages apart. When he used this phrase it wasn't even for anything that special even. Very lame usage indeed. Please don't buy this book spend your hard earned cash on something better. Get a Jack duBrul book, or a lee Child, or Douglas Preston/ Lincoln Child, anything but this. You will waste your time and money, and that sucks. I keep hoping that this author will improve but after reading all the reviews for his other books I doubt it."
1,ATLANTIS - More than the City was lost...,"I read about 20-25 books a year. My favotite authors are Preston & Child, John Grisham and Dan Brown. I enjoy both history and adventure novels so I thought ""Atlantis"" by David Gibbins had potential...WRONG!I cannot even decide what about this book I disliked more. The characters are unappealing and unrealistic. I found myself rooting for the bad guys after a while. The ""filler"" in the book was a bunch of deep sea language that only a college professor could understand. The plot was absolutely boring and predictable. The only reason I did not stop was because I paid $6.99 for it.I realize that book burning is terrible but in this book's case I would be more that happy to throw my copy on the pile."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I am unable to make it to the half way point. I've continued reading this far because the author's knowledge of history, archaeology, and underwater exploration seem very strong (to me, who knows little about any of them). But the plotline is so contrived, and the conveniences are so numerous they've become an impossible to ignore irritant, that I am not able to read another page. Maybe my hopes were too high, but the general idea of the book is fascinating to me and I really wanted it to be better."
1,"Promises much, delivers little","The book Atlantis promises a story of great wealth and depth with a lot of adventure. Instead of discovering Atlantis, we instead get involved in a pseudo military combat with characters we could care less about due to a poor character development on the part of the author. We find out little but tantalizing glimpses of Atlantis and instead focus more on fire power and fake technology.First book in my entire life that I have literally not been able to finish for sheer boredom and lack of interest."
2,Disappointing,"Reading the book description on the back cover made this sound like a good adventure story, the type of fiction I like to read. However, the 1st half of the book was pretty boring. Way too much talking between the characters, way too much historical and scientific detail that at times made it difficult to read. Characters were one-dimensional. Book was a poor imitation of a Clive Cussler novel. I forced myself to read the book because I paid for it. The 2nd half was a little better, but nothing great."
2,not her best,"ouch... okay, first of all i have to state that in my opinion, melissa is THE greatest rock singer in recent history. there is no one with a more awesome voice and knack for lyrics. HOWEVER, ""Never Enough"" was THE worst cd she's ever released. i would have only given it 1 star but ""Ain't it Heavy"" deserved one all by itself. Don't get me wrong, Melissa's the greatest female rock singer since Janis Joplin and every home should own piles of her records but my advice would be to purchase a different one."
2,Overrated,"I am so sick of Melissa Etheridge, I can't stand listening to her music any more. I used to buy all her CDs strictly because it was the lesbian thing to do, but now I refuse to waste my money. There's nothing spectacular about her voice, it's average at best. All her songs sound the same, there's not much diversity to her songwriting skills. She's pitifully weak when compared to such incredible voices as k.d. lang or Karen Carpenter."
5,Can never get enough of ME,She is one of true talent in song writing. This one I had on cassette been a long time fan. Time to get the CD. No complaints.
4,Rich for the ear.,"Some very beautiful songs on here that should be included if there ever put together a best of disc.Should include:Ain't It HeavyDance Without SleepingKeep It Preciousthe Letting GoIt's For You.Worth picking up, hetero or not."
4,pretty good,"This soundtrack is good but I gave it four stars because to me it is not as good as the first one. At first I really enjoyed the title ""Tell me what the Rain Knows"" but it is very short, barely over a minute i think, it ends before it really starts and after a while i started skipping it. There are lots of good instrumental music on it which I enjoy more than the actual pieces with lyrics. Overall its pretty good, if you like the series then you should know what you're getting into."
4,Classics Lover,"Petronius is something quite different than any other Latin I've read. There are words in there that I will NEVER need to know again in my entire life, but it was entertaining to be sure. The reader itself is very good - set up a bit like Pharrs Aeneid - vocab on one page and text with notes on the other. It's great if you are looking for something easier and lighter than Cicero or Casear."
1,I just did not get it...,"I'm originally from the UK and look forward to 'fixes' of UK comedy and drama whenever I can get them. 'Shameless' is excellent, 'The Office' is priceless and I was looking forward to this as it had been recommended to me by my brother.I tried, but this seemed immature and poorly acted. In fact, it really started to annoy me after about 10 minutes.Lots of shouting, over dramatization and a reliance on slapstick left me cold."
5,A Treasure of a Book!,"As the other reviewers, I was given the book, by an aunt, back in the 60's when I was in seventh grade. She said she had been searching for a copy for me to read because she had loved it. I remember doing a book report on it for my 7th grade English class (I got an A)--and it was one book I never forgot. I thought it was out of print & had been looking for it for years at garage sales and used book stores. Now I will have a copy to pass on to my new grandson. It is a special treasure of a book!"
2,DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS YA,BEAUTIFUL STORY FOR A YA I GOT IT ON RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT REALIZING IT WAS YA NOT FOR ME BUT IT COULD TRULY MEAN SOMETHING TO A YOUNG CHILD AROUND 10 OR MORE
5,excellent book!,A very facsinating book based on the ice road. A documentary based upon this book was on TV and I had to buy it. It was enthralling.
1,I do not feel this book is a good educational tool,"I have recently taken Macroeconomics and Microeconomics. The subject was difficult, but able to be grasped with some study. (I am an adult student)As for the ""International Economics"" textbook, I feel it is very poor as an educational medium. If you ever really sit and attempt to read this thing, all you are reading are a bunch of letters. There is no sense to the material and very little attempt to clarify anything. It is confusing enough to learn a difficult subject without having to decipher every letter of the alphabet into a different word or variable. I understand brevity is necessary to avoid repetition, but please! This is to be a learning tool. There should at least be some attempt to 'spell out' the information once. I feel this book was a very bad investment on my part, and would never have been my chosen text for this topic. I wouldn't even give it one star, but that was as low as I was able to select."
2,Too Theoretical and Useless!,"This book is very difficult to read as far as the main text is concerned. The graphs do help students understand the concepts but the organization is poor. After reading a chapter, I still do not get the ""big picture"". The authors do not attempt to provide any type of guide or roadmap for us to follow. You cannot learn anything from this book unless you are going to your prof's lectures."
4,Very good learning medume with a suffecient in-depth covearg,"Im a Computer Sceince student. Recently, I took an economics cource titeld ""International Trade"". This book is the text book for our class. I found it very easy and clear to understand ( there is no doubt that you really need to have a very solid Idea about macro and micro economics befor reading this kind of a book). The book is deep enought to servee as an educational media, it is no to little and not too much. I recommend this book"
5,One of the Best Of Y2K!,"I brought this CD On July 22, not knowing very much about Jill with the exception of her work with the Roots and her track ""Dreaming"" from the In to Deep, SDTK. I can honestly say that this has quickly become one of my favorite CD's. Jill is a true artist, an it shows on every track on this CD. I don't think I could pick a favorite because, I love them all. I can't wait till Jill come to the Washington, DC area. I will be first in line to see her! Do yourself a favor and pick up the CD, if you haven't. Peace & Blessings!"
5,"Now this is ""MUSIC""","I bought this CD based on word of mouth great reviews and damn, I'm mad that I waited soooo long to figure out who Jill Scott is! She is amazing, her work is absolutely incredible and irresistably addictive! You Go Girl, you have combined every inch of funk to surpass a level of music that hasn't been acquired by other great artists - including Michael Jackson, Lauryn Hill, and Marvin Gaye. Every single track and every single poem will make every single other CD that you've purchased seem like juvenalia compared to the quality that this dynamic woman has produced! Highly recommended!"
5,An Aural Masterpiece,"I first heard of Jill Scott through the Chris Rock show. I loved her performance so much that I went on the web and downloaded a few mp3s to see if the one song was a fluke or if the album was truly worth buying... well, I went out the next morning and bought the disc. It's the best album I've heard come out this year and perhaps the best acid jazz album since The Brand New Heavies debut."
5,Relax the soul and ease your mind with the sounds of Jill!,"I remember hearing the name Jill Scott, but I couldn't put a face to the voice, until I saw her perform on Soul Train with the Roots. Then I started seeing her name in magazines. I was an immediate fan when I heard her voice on Soul Train. Then I was looking through our school paper and there was a Review on Jill Scott. My mind went blank, I didn't know her CD was out, the next day me and my 14 dollars went to the Record Store and purchased a CD that is so magnificant, very relaxing, very soulfoul, poetic, and something I could relate to. This CD was like the medicine my soul had been feenin for. If you want a CD that is good from the beginning to end, buy Jill Scott, if you want a peace of mind and some relaxtion, buy Jill Scott. She is the voice that needs to be heard. We have lost touch of the word love and she brings it back to the soul. CONGRATULATIONS ON A WONDERFUL CD, and lets let the world get a taste of ""WHO IS JILL SCOTT?"""
5,Don't Sleep...,"I first heard Jill Scott during a Roots concert in Washington, DC. I must admit, I wasn't too impressed. Then I heard her spoken word, she's laid-back, yet edgy, earthy, and every sophisticated. Her sound and presentation is polished. I was blown away. All I could think was, ""ooh, Lauryn and Ericka better drop somethin' quick!"" Jill has the potential to dominate. Unfortunately, she isn't getting the publicity she deserves. I hope she blows up, and I hope that you all support her. Buy the album!"
5,Who Is Jill Scott?,"I purchased Jill's debut CD today and I can't stop listening to it. She is a gifted sister, that can relate to the feelings of so many of us. Her writing is hip and intuitive. This CD has to be one of the best I've heard in a while. So many artists now are trying to revert to what would be considered mainstream, while Jill is keeping it real. She has a range and can really SANG!! Congratulations to Jill and thank you for the great album."
5,We've Got a superstar Here,Jill scott Is maybe the greatest singer to grace the tracks of plastic (CD) in the 21 century. This is the frist time in a long time that I have purchased a cd and enjoyed every track from 1 to -44 May you give us many years Ms. Scott.
5,THIS IS THE GIRL!!!!,"Yes, finally a good musician who know what and who she is. She conveys her thought and emotions over melodies you can't help but love. This is a must get for you music collection. Who is Jill Scott? The start of a new generation of musicians."
5,This album crept into my soul,"I can honestly say that this is the best cd that I have ever purchased. The first time that I heard it I didn't really feel it, but when I put it on again it got me. This is one of those cds that you can never get sick of. I find myself singing along with her in my car, in the shower, and in my mind. She is a wonderful mixture of jazz, hip-hop, and soul. If you like The Roots, Johnny Coltrane, and good music period, this is the album to get."
3,overrated,"Who is Jill Scott?, with luscious vocals is not as good as i expected. the lyrics were lacking any true soul... and anyone who has to call themself a poet in their songs... obviously isn't one. overall, this cd is good pretty much only for background music."
2,"""Who Is Jill Scott?""...A Long Walk from Impressive","There has been excessive ""HYPE"" centered around the release of: ""Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1"". The fact is, the albums vibe is very inconsistent. O.k., great, she sings the hook for: ""You Got Me"" better than Erykah Badu, that does'nt mean her album is any better. Beneath the hip-hop influenced, bluesy tempo, is the same ""brokenhearted"", ""sensually-based"" drama. The only track to truly look forward to, and find a sense of ""refreshment"" on, is the bueatiful: ""A LONG WALK"". It's groove is rich and inspiring, accompanied by Jill's powerful, crystal-clear alto, which strongly emphasizes, that a true relationship is not only ""mutual edification"", but ""power"" and ""influence"" as well. Unfortunately, ""Who Is Jill Scott?"" DID NOT impress my listening ears. It will take a bit more than ""unorthodoxed grooves"" and ""spoken word"" to stirr this soul. Better luck next time."
2,who is jill scott? she thinks she's badu,"I bought this cd after listening to all the hype. For the life of me I can't figure out what the big deal is. Jill's voice is nice, but the music is derivative. Buy the new Erekah Badu cd for the real thing. One thing that might have helped is if the music had been more varied. You can only sustain a mellow groove for so long until it gets boring. Check out the Kelis cd to see a perfect mix of tempos."
5,If you don't know now you know,"I just picked up Jill Scott's debut album and I was very impressed. Ms. Scott has a refreshing mellow sound. Every song is awesome and the CD is just made better by the fact that Scott penned all the songs on her debut. If you like Badu, Angie Stone, Maxwell, D'angelo, and Amel then you'll be more than happy to add Jill Scott to your collection."
5,Wow!!!,"I remember when this album first came out, I thought, who is Jill Scott indeed? I figured, oh boy, here comes someone else jumping on this neo-soul bandwagon or whatever with too many tracks on their album and a lot of gratuitous swearing. Then my friend bought it and let me borrow it along with the Alicia Keys album. Well... Alicia doesn't really do it for me (and is quite guilty of the gratuitous swearing thing), and I figured this Jill Scott album would be pretty boring, but, wow, was I wrong. I mean, just the intro alone is off the hook! I was so delighted with the whole thing I immediately played it again once it was through. You know you really like an album when you play it two times in a row the first time you hear it. If I ever give this thing back to my friend I'll be definately getting my own copy."
5,"Jill Scott, I know her and where she's coming from","Jill seems to be giving listeners the word and sounds needless to say fresh tracks that makes it easy to do what ever. Should be who's (Badu).She took over and it's only Vol.1(Badu, come out,come out where ever you are... and it better be fast and strong."
5,she must have come to my house a read my journal,I just don't know what to say. I am completly amazed by the kind of artistry this woman has shown us with this lovely collection of music. I am a singer myself and I hope that one day I too will make a CD that will touch one person as much as this cd has touched me.... If you don't have I dont know what ya waitin' for cause it doesn't get better than this
5,absolutely awesome,"This has to be the most awesome piece of music that I have ever purchased. I find the lyrics are mature and reflective of someone that has had a life. It is incredibly refreshing and I enjoy every single cut whether I'm relaxing, studying, or hanging out at Starbucks. I agree with the other reviewer who thought that other performers were emulating this style, like Alicia Keyes."
5,"""WHO IS JILL SCOTT?"" will soon be a redundant question.","This debut CD is one of the most original recordings I have heard in quite a while! Mixing her poetry and neo-soul melodies have created a sound that brings realism and honesty to music that haven't been heard in a while. Not since Erykah Badu have a disc garnered so much attention, and once you listen to what Ms. Scott has to offer, the only question left is ""Can you do this again?"" I am hoping the answer is ""yes!"""
5,New Neo-Soul Queen,"All I can say is thank you Hidden Beach Recordings. Ms. Scott's music is poetic like Nikki Giovanni and soulful like Erica Badu. If you love the combination you are going to love her. By the way Ms. Badu you better drop some product quickly cause this sista is coming for your crown. Well produced and I hope well marketed because Jill has platinum skills. You will not be disappointed. My favorite tune right now is ""Gettin' In My Way"" but the whole product is banging. You gotta BUY this one as I plan on doing."
1,Generation gap?,"I bought this because I heard Jill Scott sing at a tribute for Stevie Wonder, one of his works. So without hearing any of her works I bought this. I wish she would do a disc of oldies, especially Motown."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Nowadays if you have alittle Groove with a Touch of Jazz you have Talent? I still Stick To Sade.But Jill Scott ain't even Anita Baker.this is 2nd tier Mary J.Bliege,Erika Badu Letovers.how many tracks have that click clack sound that the Roots Questlove&D'Angelo use? I heard her on The Roots&on The WIld,WIld West Soundtrack&she was just Like Faith Evans a Mary J.Bliege Clone.this is Why R-N-B is in The Toliet Now,No Challenges.Jill Scott Needs To WOrking WIth PRINCE or SOmebody that has Real Talent instead of the same old Tip/Tap.She is a Good Writter.but the Music is Boring&Predictable.this isn't the Philly Era of Gamble&Huff.when Philly use to Rock.Jill Scott is Closer To Deborah Cox or TOni Braxton(Boring Predictable Music)than Sade."
1,can't listen to the whole cd,"i didn't like any of the songs. They all sound the same. If you like listening to more then an hour of slow songs, then go ahed but this isn't for everybody."
5,BEAUTIFUL!!!!!,THIS IS A WONDERFUL CD. THE BEATS IS OFF THE HOOK AND THE LYRICS IS REALLY ON POINT. GOOD JOB JILL!!! I WISH YOU THE BEST.(SMILES)
4,Really good stuff here; a great debut.,"Best described as a mix between Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu - think Macy Gray with a more traditional voice. It's more R&B than Hip Hop, with lots of great writing. ""Exclusively"" has a great hook, ""She sniffed"", ""Love Rain"" has the line ""Now, me not clairvoyant and in love made the koochi easy and the obvious invisible"", while ""Watching Me"" has this gem: ""Excuse me miss/May I have your phone number and your social security/Who me? When all I came to do was buy my double or triple A batteries?/Please, I decline."" This is a great, modern, hip romantic disc."
5,Who Is Jill Scott?,"A phenomenal talent, that's who she is! This CD has a groove to it that will truly capture you. I can't stop listening to it! I love this CD! I've tuned others onto it. Her poetry is too deep. You have to listen closely to truly get an appreciation for her writing. Her music embraces me. Her voice is strong and powerful one moment and soft and delicate the next. Truly a work of art. If you are a mellow music lover, you need Jill in your collection. Who is Jill Scott? Sheer perfection."
4,Very Impressive!,"I expected this album to be good and I was not disappointed. IMO, Jill Scott has released the best R&B/Soul album of the year. I can't see anything being released this year that will surpass her debut effort. The tracks Do You Remember, Gettin' In The Way(my personal favorite), It's Love, Love Rain(even the RMX w/Mos Def), and Slowly Surely are all beautiful tracks. A Touch Of Jazz is a wonderful production team whose creative sound fits Jill Scott's vocals and spoken word perfectly. While this album is great, it has it's Baduizm moments, which takes away from Jill Scott's originality and it is also a little too long. Jill Scott's vocals are amazing and the production is incredible, but most importantly, this album is great because it is the best R&B/Soul release that you are going to hear anywhere for a while."
5,Love It!,"I love this cd! I have played over and over again! Similar in style to Erykah Badu, but with her own unique flavor. Jill Scott has become one of my favorite R&B artists."
5,the girl can sang,"this is a most soulful and and thoughtful cd. with each lyric and tune jill sends you to a new depth of soul. loved it all of it. ""BROWN SKIN "" was the bomb."
5,Intoxicating,"I bought this album last October from a guy in Virgin Megastore who called her the ""other Erykah Badu"". A week hasn't gone by that I haven't listened to this album, cover to cover, at least once. Her voice is mesmorizing, the lyrics reach down to your most intimate of places and brings out feelings you share with only those very special people.I went to see Jill live at Radio City on St. Patrick's Day. It's unfortunate because, like it says in the writing under the CD (it's difficult to read, but it's a good read none the less), her album doesn't even come close to preparing you for the live experience! You are doing yourself an injustice if you don't go and see Jill in concert. Her background singers are better than 99% of the R&B; singers out today (no exaggeration). If Jill is performing within 100 miles of NYC, I will be there to listen. This sister is a gift to the ears, mind, heart, and soul. Open your present."
4,Had to change my review,"Okay, I'll admit that when I first got this CD, I really didn't see what was so special about it. I gave it a so-so review here on Amazon because at the time, I wasn't really feeling it. But after hearing some cuts from her excellent live CD, EXPERIENCE, I took another listen to WHO IS JILL SCOTT? Now I understand what everyone else was raving about. I found out that she had written some songs for Erykah Badu's first CD, which I loved, and a song by the Roots called ""You Got Me""...and I became an instant fan. Jill has a sweet, beautifully melodic voice, and her poetry, real and earthy, touches your heart. I especially like the songs ""A Long Walk"", ""Do You Remember"", ""He Loves Me (Lyzel in E Flat)"", ""The Way"" and ""Gettin' In The Way""....just gorgeous. Her music, which has the neo-soul vibe that I love, is refreshing, soothing and honest, hip-hop with ""A Touch of Jazz"" (smile). Who is Jill Scott? Someone who should not be slept on!"
5,Jill or Erykah?,"It is not often that a chanteuse comes along with such depth as Jill presents here with her debut effort. Ms. Scott writes,sings, and composes beautiful music with heartfelt emotion. It is obvious that her life experiences take the forefront of her sound. That is why we are so easily moved by her vibe...we can relate to her! Yeah, God made us funky but leave it to the artists to pen the vibes. ** As for comparing her to Ms.Badu,Davina,Grenique, or a host of other Neo-Soul pundits, don't bother. Each one has a sound that is refreshing in its own right. Jill is not Erykah is not any other! I would easily recommend this album to music purists of any genre. It will serve as a welcome addition to any definitive music collection!Watson"
5,love at first play,"Her beats are crisp and deep. She has so much soul and lets it go at the perfect time. This CD needs to be played on a really good sound system, its a whole different experience that can entertain 100% of your attention. Perfect for waking up to or getting down to, both in the sheets or on the dance floor;)"
5,Who Is Jill Scott? CLASSIC MATERIAL!,"What is there not to say about this album? Jill Scott exemplifies the true essence of what real soul music is with her debut album Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds, Vol. 1. Classic tracks like ""Gettin' In The Way,"" ""He Loves Me,"" ""The Way"" and ""A Long Walk"" certified Jill's career in the R&B music realm. Album cuts like ""Watching Me"" and ""Brotha"" were socially conscious and conveyed a message. Others like ""Exclusively,"" ""Honey Molasses,"" and ""Slowly, Surely"" give us a heavy dose of her poetic expressions set to soulful melodies. But it was truly all about the slow songs, and cuts like ""Show Me"" and ""I Think It's Better"" stand out as album tracks just as worthy of being released as singles as her other classic material. If you don't own this album, then you should really be ashamed of yourself if you consider yourself an R&B fan. Who Is Jill Scott? If you don't already know, then maybe it's best that you take a long walk to the nearest music shop."
5,it gets better every time,"I got this album when it came out, but only listened to the 'popular tracks'. 4 years later, I am a little more mature, and I have to say that this CD is flawless. I've grown into Its Love, Love Rain, and Slowly Surely. I guess you never really appreciate the lyrics of a masterpiece until you can relate to them. The experience and insight of Jill Scott are infinite and is reflected in the depth of this CD. 10/10."
2,Another Listen,"I don't know, I listened to the album...I read the reviews. Maybe I need to give it another listen, because frankly, I could not get into her music. For lyrics, I go to Meshell Ndegeocello...for voice, I go to Rachelle Ferrell."
5,Fab Jill Scott,"This album is brilliant, Jill Scott has such an array of different vocal ranges that it would be extremely differicult for anyone to dislike her style. The album incorporates elements of funk, jazz, reggae and soul with a touch of Judy Gardland. Go buy it you won't be disappointed."
5,Calming but yet groovy,"Man if anyone doesn't have the Jill Scott cd...man go get it."" The cd is mainly about love, and life ..and Jill keeps it real with her words. Check this out if you love music like I do you'll feel me ...If I want to chill I will put Jill Scott, Maxwell, Miss E. Badu in my cd player...now do you feel me when I say go get Jill Scotts' CD...and when you do play ""The Way"" first that song is the sh....Peace Yvette G.B. from San Frncisco,CA"
5,all of them,"OMG!! Jill Scott is Hott!! All I can say is that this woman is fierce! I have been enjoying this CD for over a month now and enjoy it from beginning to end...I just cannot get enuff of it! I havent heard someone so real in such a long time and you can definately relate to the lyrics. I can sense her strong poet, chill, coolness in her being, she is so deep and it feels so good!! I tell you, this CD will just enter your system like none other. I think what I like about it most is the non-commercialized approach to her music. She is just so real. I also liked the fact that she is associated with The Roots, so you know definately that her music is tight. Unfortunately, I did not see the Chris Rock show, but if she has a concert close to where I live , I will definately go see her. Enuff Said"
5,I needed a cigarette after listening to this & I don't smoke,"This CD is awarded BEST CD OF THE CENTURY in my book. I finally found something worth listening too! I bought a copy for my computer, car, and home. I bought copies for my friends and enemies. Trust me your money will not be wasted."
5,Vinyl Please!!!!!!!!!!!!! Album of the Year!!!!,"I'm a DJ whose always looking for hot sounds..not trends..Jill Scott is a God send to this so called industry...I hope all you people recognize true talent and show respect...If You wanna know how this album sounds.. THink of that far away place where there is nothing but peace..SLow and smooth, fast paced and exciting...It leaves a smile on your face-ah refreshing to taste something so juicy and untainted....It's the best thing i've heard in a long time...Tell all about this one!!! ANd Jill if you're out there can i get a copy on vinyl!!!Please!!!!fatt_88@hotmaill.com"
5,Refreshing!,"A friend of mine told me to check this CD out; I came to Amazon.com and listened to the sound bites and said to myself ""maybe""... But then one day a song came on the radio that stopped me dead in my tracks -- I couldn't get to the phone fast enough to call the station and find out who it was. It was Jill Scott, and the song was ""The Way"". Needless to say, I ordered this CD the same day. Since then, I have been playing this CD non-stop -- while working, while chilling, in my car... AMAZON'S SOUND BITES DO NOT DO THIS CD JUSTICE! I love every single track on this CD (even the intro) -- no ""filler"" material at all. Jill Scott is extremely talented and creative; her lyrics are origianl, deep, funny, real... her voice is smooth and so full of flavor. It is so refreshing to hear her sound when it seems like everything else on the radio sounds the same."
4,Who is Jill Scott...,"Who is Jill Scott? A talented artist, that's who! There are people out there who've never heard of this hard-working individual. Give her a chance and listed - you might like what you hear! Four stars!"
5,"A WOMAN WHO KNOWS WHAT ""REAL LOVE"" IS","HOW SWEET IT IS TO FINALLY BE BLESSED WITH MUSIC THAT SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO MY HEART. ""WHO IS JILL SCOTT?"" JILL SCOTT IS A FANTASTIC ARTIST WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK HER HEART IN A WAY THAT TOUCHES THE SOUL. THIS MIXTURE OF JAZZ AND HIP-HOP WAS DONE TO PERFECTION. I APPRECIATE HER SOFT SULTRY ALTO VOICE AND THE SOULFUL POETIC WORDS THAT COULD ONLY COME FROM REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES. HOW CAN ANYONE COMPARE JILL SCOT TO ERYCA BAHDU? THE TWO ARE NOT ON THE SAME LEVEL AT ALL. THUMBS UP TO JILL SCOTT. PLEASE KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO BEST---KEEP EXPRESSING THE LOVE AND SHARING IT WITH THE WORLD."
5,great cd # 7 i is da bom,"excellent cd, I especially love #7 , the words in her song make you just want to grab unto hubby and cuddle for while, she is the female luther with the words in these songs, keep up the good work, great job"
4,Who is Jill Scott? The Next Big thang!,Even though this was released way back when. The hype is starting to build up just now. This girl is as soulful as it gets. Stand-out tracks are: Do You Remember and A Long Walk. Listen to the CD on a rainy day and listen to her voice soulfully glide from track to track.
4,Excellent Debut,"This is an excellent debut by Jill Scott. This CD is beautiful, soulful, artistic. It's definitely worth listening to. Jill Scott has so much variety with this album, not only in the songs but with the way she sings. At some times, she sings staight from the diaphragm with a resonant deep tone; at other times she is light and airy with an almost falsetto voice; other times she is smooth and kinda jazzy. She also has a unique ""flow"" in a couple of the songs (Love Rain, Watchin' Me). If you're into mature, soulful R&B with great variety and real instruments (i.e. Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu), you'll love this album."
5,Great mood music,This is a great CD for get togethers or for riding in your car. Jill Scott is a fantastic lyricist and has a sultry voice that appeals to anyone. She is also down to earth.
4,THE BOMB CD,"I FOUND THIS CD TOTALLY REFRESHING,SHE HAS HER OWN SOUND.It'S SO NICE TO KNOW THAT A YOUNG ARTIST CAN MAKE MUSIC THAT's original and unsampled.It IS TRULY FROM THE HEART."
5,"Can you say ""Double-Platinum""","Over the years I have collected over 500 CDs. This one, WHO IS JILL SCOTT, has found a spot in my top 10 of all time. I won't bore you with what the the other are. Suffice it to say that Jill Scott's debut release will likely win a Grammy for Best New Artist and, at the very least, be nominated for Best R&B Album. I am so fascinated with this release that I had to buy a second copy just so I could have access to it at home and in the car. It's extremely rare (for me) to want to listen to an album from start to finish as is the case with this one. Jill mainly talks about love -- something we all need. Her lyrics, her groove, and her depth will draw you in and elevate you to a higher state. My personal favorites are #7, ""He Loves Me"" and #9, ""The Way"", but there are plenty of other GREAT tracks. Take it from me, one satisfied customer, you will LOVE this album. Peace"
5,Excellent Music,"This CD is a classic. Now a days, not to much music stands out from the rest. But every now and then an artist comes along and let's us know what good music is all about. The perfect word to describe this CD is PERFECT. Believe me you don't need to worry about who Jill Scott is before you go pick up her cd, just go pick it up. Once you listen to the CD you'll know all about her...."
5,WHO IS JILL SCOTT,"THAT RIGHT WHO IS JILL SCOTT WELL IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOU NEED TO BUY THIS CD AND FIND OUT. JILL WILL MOVE YOU LIKE KNOW OUTHER ARTIST OUT THERE. I JUST PURCHASE 5 COPY OF THIS CD TO SHARE WITH MY FRIENDS THE CD IS NICE VERY NICE SOMEONE GOT A GOLD MIND ON THERE LABEL.CSHAW Greensboro,NC"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this watch about a month ago and am very disappointed. One of the gold bees came off of the watchband this week, which left the band with a big rip where the bee was. The watch hands come out of the middle of Eeyore's head, so it is impossible to see all of Eeyore."
2,REJECT THIS JUNK,"Anything having to do with Ron Wyatt, Bob Cornuke, Michael Rood etc. Reject! These are ""Headline Indiana Jones"" Wannabee's. There are many fine Bible Believing Archaeologists but they are rarely interviewed or acknowledged.My List of Credible Organizations...- The Near East Archaeological Society- The Associates for Biblical Research- The Institute for Biblical Archaeology- World of the Bible Ministries"
2,Excessive rather than expressive,"Bell's prodigious technique not withstanding, he continually approaches the repetoire as a personal Rorshach, rather than a journey to the composer's intention. In concert, he bends and sways like a fiddler at a Hungarian restaurant. Judging by this Sibelius, he's never met a ritard he didn't like. All of that herky-jerky stopping and starting all but ruins the gorgeous through line of this miraculous concerto. Sibelius may have been a romantic, but his Finnish personality was cooler by many Celsius degrees than the stereotypical sheen given by Mr. Bell. By contrast, Salonen's accompaniment with the L.A. Phil may be even more persuasive than his work with The Philharmonia for Cho-Liang Lin. But Lin's absolute understanding of the work, his intelligence, clarity, beautiful tone...his total approach makes this the recording to own. Lin has unjustifiably never attained the superstar status of Bell, but he is by far the greater musician."
2,somewhat lost in expression....,"Bell starts the Sibelius quite beautifully. It is full of poetic beauty with delicate nuances. However, as it goes on, the true beauty of the music gets lost in his too much coloration in each phrasing. A bit too much of shading in each phrase he creates, and the scale of the music is not outlined well. It is well expressed, but somewhat it sounds like the music was broken into pretty pieces.The best of Sibelius will be Cho Liang Lin, Kyung Wha Chung, David Oistrakh and Heifetz. All of them have the inner strength in the thin line of Sibelius' beautiful melody. Bell completely misses the mark.Also, Salonen is terrible here. He was very good when he did with Lin. But with Bell, there are some dull moments in the 2nd movement. Just there is no magic between the two.Goldmark, I think Bell is quite good here, but I strongly recommend Sarah Chang's Goldmark.I know Bell is a great violinist. His recent live performance of Vieuxtemps No.5 proves it, but not this disc."
3,"Lovely, lovely sounds but not involving as performances","Bell doesn't know how to make an unbeautiful sound on the violin, and he plays an incredible Stradivarius. The recorded sound of both soloist and orhestra is super-clear and detailed, one of the best to come out of LA from Sony. But as a peformance the Sibelius in particular is uninvolving, sounding far too careful and fussed over. Too bad, becasue both Bell and Salonen are major young artists. I had hoped for better."
5,Fantastic Book on GT Diffraction and UT Diffraction,"This book is great!!! If you need to know UTD and GTD this is the book to buy! It explains Why!! And does so in a clear understandable way. This book is for graduate level electromagnetic scattering students or graduate level physicists, or mathematicians in the field of scattering. It is also a great reference book! When I teach this class, I will definitely use this book!!!This book will ease the process of learning uniform theory of diffraction and how to use it!!!!! A++++++++++"
4,none,just an FYI for the reviewers who sais AG died as a result of drugs..he did not...he died as a result of a viral infection in his heart.not drugs!
4,"one great ""greatest hits"" collection","some of the late '70's and early '80's best pop songs are here in this collection, which thankfully includes the album version of ""(love is)thicker than water"", and not the edited single version.this would have been a 5-star album if ""all i have to do is dream"", his #51 duet with victoria principal from 1981, was included.nonetheless, this album has its place among the best ""greatest hits"" albums in history. s"
4,delightful,"The Impossible Woman is Emma Darcy's 8th romance novel. When budding landscape gardener Judy Campbell delivered some turf to a new and very impressive mansion, she didn't realise the gorgeous hunk in shorts in the backyard was rich architect Malcolm Stewart. By the time they have laid two truckloads of turf and had a swim in the pool together, Judy finds herself succumbing to Mal's attractions. But as things develop, she discovers who he is and that marriage is the furthest thing from his mind. As stubborn and persistent as each other, this is a slightly different take on the Stewart/Campbell feud. Delightful."
3,I think I out grew Al,"I picked up this CD as a blast from the past and ended up giving it away. I still am amazed at his ability to transform a song and make us all laugh, but I guess I just kind of out grew his antics."
3,Funny he may be ...,"...but nowhere as funny as the review above, which is supposed to be a review of this CD from Gramophone magazine! I guess even Amazon makes mistakes - but you guys ought to have caught this one! Read the review in the spirit of what Weird Al generally does to such pomposity, and it's a laugh anyway. Oh yeah - about the album; the man's been making music to laugh by since the days when Michael Jackson didn't even know any good plastic surgeons, so go out and buy it."
3,"Fun and laughter, tongue in cheek","Your typical Weird Al...Well, what can I say? I love to have a couple of funny CDs in my car, when I plan on a longer road trip. It helps me stay awake, to listen to some really fun-poking songs in between...It is unpretentious and hilarious... for the price, you can't go wrong if you like a little musical chuckle or a good laugh from time to time..."
2,"All of Al's early hits, yes, only 2 stars.",This collection is pretty bad. The second hits collection is better. It's not even really that funny.
5,Parody Paradise,"Weird Al's ""Greatest Hits, Volume 1"" lives up to its name. A collection of admittedly can't-listen-to-them-too-often hits, what you have here are some of the best examples of parody songs you'll find anywhere. A send-up of Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" (""Addicted to Spuds"") and the original song ""One More Minute"" are gloom-busters of the best kind. Also included are hilarious takes on Madonna's ""Like A Virgin,"" and Michael Jackson's ""Bad"" and ""Beat It.""""One More Minute"" is as dead-on a spoof of 50's angst/love songs as you'll ever find, right down to the sob in Al's voice. True, you can't listen to albums like this too often or they wear on you, but try taking it off the shelf every once in a while for a listen. It's almost guaranteed to brighten your day."
4,LOVE IT,"I love this CD. I wish there were more hits on it, but hey. I like The Allman Brothers Band loads better than Greg Allman on his own. It took me awhile to finally find the song/s I like, done the way I remember them. Glad I finally found this one."
3,A Decade of hits 1969-1979 The Allman Bros,The quality of the recording could be better. Great tunes from a great band.
4,Great Southern Rock Band,"This is a great collection for those wanting to revisit or update their collection of Southern Rock. It is also an excellent introduction to the Southern Rock of the late sixties/early seventies, since this was one of the signal groups of the period."
2,"This album is not the ""Best"" of the Brothers","This CD is not the best of the Allman Brothers, but is an O.K. CD all the same. Unfortuantely, it focuses more on the post-Duane era than when the guitarist was with the band, and when their best material was produced. Instead, for a true best of album, get ""Beginnings"" (their first two albums on one disc, or ""Live at Fillmore East"", which shows off the jamming side of the band better and includes some blues tunes never recorded in the studio (by the Allman Brothers)."
3,NOT ENOUGH,"Sure, the Allman Brotheres Band is the greatest southern rock band of all time, and my personal favorite. Sure, every single song on here is absolutely amazing, but unless you've never even heard of the Allman Brothers before, you need more.Instead of this unsubstancial collection of some of the hits, I would recommend ""Stand Back: The Anthology"" This overview really gives you a better portion of what you really need.If you like this and are interested in more, ""Live at Fillmore East"" really shows off their jamming talent, and ""Eat a Peach"" is their most solid studio album."
5,speedy delivery,"I CHECKED THE EXPRESS SHIPPING BOX JUST TO CHECK THE PRICE AND DECIDED TO GO WITH REGULAR MAIL, BUT WHEN I FINISHED MY ORDER THE EXPRESS SHIPPING WAS STILL SELECTED SO I GOT IT IN A HURRY. THE MUSIC IS REALY GOOD FOR CRUZING, AT THE BEACH OR DOING HOUSE WORK. IT REMINDS ME OF LINERD SKINERD ON STEROIDS."
5,Great CD ~ Great Price,This CD has all the classic Allman Brothers hits. All top hits at a top price. What more can you ask?
4,Love It !!,I always read Amazon reviews before purchasing something and I was not led astray. They all said it was great and I have to agree. This has so many familiar and great rock songs. It brings back fond memories.
5,A masterpiece of southern rock,"The Allman Brother's Band, as exemplified in their Decade of Hits Album, quientessentially define southern rock. Drawing upon influences from country, blues, jazz, and rock, these incredible musicians produce a greatest hits album superior to its peers. Very few albums can be played all the way through without even an urge to touch the skip button. Anyone who appreciates music will love and admire this great album."
4,A Good Example of Life Within Nazi Germany,"This is a surprisingly informative book that covers each aspect of German life in the beginning of the 20th Century. It is not the most comprehensive book on the subject, but it gives the reader a good deal of information to go on for further research.Starting with a chapter on Adolf Hitler, the book describes economics issues, Hitler Youth, the women of the Reich, genocide of Jews and others deemed racially inferior to the Nazis, and other topics of home front Germany.It is chock full of photos, and the text is quite interesting. I knocked the book down one star because it's not a comprehensive read. It's really a well-written picture book with the kind of text normally found in school books.In fact, to give people a better sense of how an average German lived, this is a great place to start."
1,Worse than AA batteries. Suddenly dies.,Tried this as a possible improvement over using AA NiHM batteries in my Olympus D-524 camera. Turned out to be a DOWNGRADE. Did not stay charged as long as my Panasonic 1950 mAh AA batts. It would die a sudden death -- no low battery warnings before the camera shut down. I have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the AA NiHM batts. The CR-V3 now gathers dust. It did not even improve the flash recycle time. Just a waste.
4,Better than NiMH batteries for cameras that will fit this,"Li-on batteries have no memory, like NiMH, and work in colder weather and also do not lose their charge as quickly. They also take more pictures on one charge. Note however that different Li-on chargers do not work with different manufacturer batteries. In the end, this will cost you less than an NiMH."
3,Short life - check the data sheet,"The data sheet on this battery indicates 1200 mAh. It's lithium, so it holds up better than NimH, but there are lithium rechargables available that offer higher mAh.For the price it isn't bad, though."
4,Very useful. Must buy.,These batteries are great. They last very long. Great performance. Low charging time. The normal batteries that came with the camera were dead in an hour. But these batteries last about 3 times of filling the whole memory with photos in the camera. may be more.Definitely a must have for A Nikon 3200 Coolpix.
3,Who wrote the instruction manual????,"The bike came without screws to attach the front fender to the frame and wheel mount, and I still haven't found anything that fits. Also, the tube in the front wheel was defective and wouldn't hold air so I had to purchase a new one before I could even use the bike. The instruction manual for the bike assembly is TERRIBLE!!!!! The written instructions are useless (I think it must be a translation from another language and something definitely got lost!) and the pictures are not far behind. As a single women, it took me 3 evenings to figure out where things went and how to put everything together - very frustrating. The frame was scratched in shipping. On a positive note, I can say that the bike is very nice looking."
3,Did it fall off the truck?,"When I saw the condition of the box with bike parts sticking out of it I thought it had fallen off the back of a truck onto the railroad tracks and hit by the 3:10 to Yuma. After unpacking found plenty of scratches and a couple of bent parts but didn't want to hassle returning it. Fortunately no parts were missing. The assembly instructions are worthless but I managed to figure it out. It took about 2 hours to assemble. One tire would not hold air so I had to take it to a bike shop and have it repaired. In the end it is a nice bike, I just wish it wasn't all beat up."
5,"Joe Anthony, San Antonio, 1975","There was something going on in South Texas in the mid-1970's that will forever change the way I think of rock music. My Mexican friends made it happen. Angel, Lone Star, Budgie, Moxie, Rush, Gamma, Starz. Forget it Kenny Chesney, this is what takes me back!Listen to ""Rock and Roll"" and imagine yourself 17, and driving to the Municipal Autitorium, in a traffic jam, with every other kid in town playing the same song."
5,ROCK HISTORY CAPTURED ON VINYL -THE 70's ROCKED,"I got into ANGEL in the mid 80's so I really don't know how big they really were,but this first effort by the band was enough for me to go out on a quest to go out and get everything I could get my hands on by this group.Progressive rock like this is truly a timeless art ."
5,Angel album,"I first heard this album as a kid in early 1970-something. I as riding my bicycle down the road and came upon a radio station promotional event at a place of business. The guy at the booth gave me this album and I liked it. Decades later after loosing the original, I found it on CD here and got it. A great memory and pretty good progressive music with a unique sound."
5,Perfect Fit,It only took about 15 minutes to replace this fuel filter on my 1998 Cadillac Eldorado. It was a perfect fit and the car runs great after its replacement.
2,just not an enjoyable storyline,"John Irving is a good writer, self-indulgent at times, but very readable nonetheless. This book was recommended to me by my boss who absolutely loves it. Unfortunately, I thought Irving tried too hard here and the book is actually borderline perverse. Crappy ending as well- I'd look elsewhere for your reading pleasure unless you enjoy pornographic romance novels regarding the issues involved in swinging."
4,Typical Irving,"This was a typical John Irving read, though there seemed to be a lot more sex in this book than others I've read. The plot centres on two couples that are each having some measure of marital problems. They embark on a special relationship, that's all I can say without giving away the plot. I doubt that it was the point of the book, but Irving doesn't come close to capturing the complexities of marriage. It's a light read about some people who get into a lot of twists and turns because of some of the mistakes that each couple has made in their marriage. It's written from the point of view from one of the men, a writer, and he's a very odd person."
4,Good offering from Irving,"If you count some of Irvings other works, this might mot be considered up to par with the rest. However, I strongly suggest this to anyone looking for a book with adventure, hijinks and mission fulfillment.The mastery of this story, I think, is the way that the two 'periods' (or three) in the lead characters life run in a sometimes zig-zaggy line throughout. As the stroy progresses, you begin to see the links between the two, so As if the same lessons are being learned in different ways. It's great how it lines up in the end.A fit of giggles is a sure fir gaurentee for the Irving fan, and the part-time fan will see the beginings of his later greatness in this work.The character here is very well developed, in the ackward Irving sort of way. I have to admitt that there were times where I was led away from the real story and my faith of the autor waivered, but is was roped in by the end, and I'm True believer in the Water-Method (and its man)."
2,This may be good by only the most narrow of definitions,"By ""good,"" I mean it is gramatically correct, contains appropriate punctuation, etc. But hey! What book ISN'T ""good"", provided it has been in the hands of a copy editor or ten? I read this book only because it was bound into one hardcover which also contained _The Water Method Man_ and _Setting Free the Bears_. I am grateful to have read _Setting Free the Bears_ since I feel it is a masterfully told story. As for this one, though, it engaged me the way the enlarged print condensed books I find on the tables at hospitals and the dentist's office engage me. Don't waste your time. Floss your teeth instead."
1,"Tedious, tiresome, mysogynistic little book","One might say that about all of Irving's books (ok, maybe not the little part) but just about all of them have some redeeming qualities that make you overlook his tedious, heavy-handed style and reach for metaphors. However, I couldn't find them in this book.Like all trashy novels, this was oddly compelling in a voyeuristic sort of way. But whenever I thought it would improve and become a creative and interesting character study, it headed further down some disgusting path (not just the sexual content). Some reviews describe this book as erotic - to me it was just lewd and gross. WHO would want to have sex with any of these people? or read 245 pages about them?"
1,"Worse than trash, it is BORING trash",How could such a titillating topic be so boring? This book could interest only holdovers from the sexual revolution who want to relive those freewheeling times.
2,eh,"The silver ""metal"" paint wore off within a few months and the plastic clip broke off so it can no longer be clipped to a pocket. Also, the turning mechanism that exposes the pen tip no longer turns without great effort. I bought this for my boyfriend and he got a few months of use out of it, but now it's basically junk. Neat design and fine quality of sound, but not lasting."
2,digital voice recorder pen,"This pen keeps falling apart. Also, it is difficult to use the recording part because you have to almost shout to record anything. I am sorry I bought it."
1,Don't waste your money,"The recorder/pen looks nice but doesn't work very well. I could never get mine to turn on without taking it apart, jiggling the batteries and then trying to turn it on again. Your money is better spent on a non-China made product."
2,glad I didn't buy,I borrowed this from the library before I bought. Turns out it was a good idea. I only found 3 recipes I would actually make for our dog. too bad... the pictures are super cute.
1,Not thrilled at all,This one was a flop. I bought one for my son and one for my daughter. My daughters stopped working right away. My sons will play but it skips a lot. So I am looking to replace them with something with a little better quality.
3,eh... so-so,"i'd hafta say that this cd player is only the average. it doesn't have any special features, it isn't particularly great, etc. and so on. But, on the flip side, it's got all the basics and so it isn't completley bad."
4,Very Good,"I am happy with the CD player, I only wish that it had a clip. So I could clip it to my pants. Other wise it's great."
2,Changed my mind,"Now I'm dissappointed in Memorex. My Memorex TV broke. And now, my CD player from Memorex broke as well. Doesn't close. Latch is broken. Well, it's good while it lasts. Also other people have the same problem on circuitcity.com too! I agree. Don't get it. Get the RP2472 made by RCA instead. Works gr8 for me."
2,to each its own with this product,"Like all other women trying this, I took it in hopes of getting a normal period and hopefully falling pregnant. You have to rule out major health concerns, and if there's no bigger issue, this can aide in pregnancy. But for me it did nothing, so i stopped taking it, however, that doesn't mean it cant work for others, as i have seen,"
4,Very helpful and detailed,"This was my first trip to NYC and I found the Rough Guide very helpful. There were detailed maps of the bus system, the subway system, lodging and places to see. There was also information on the outer boroughs, useful for my trip into Brooklyn. The one thing I didn't like was that restaurants weren't listed in the index. You had to go to the restaurant section of the book and look in the neighborhood, then under the type of cuisine. Which meant when my friend recommended a specific place, I couldn't look it up in the book easily, or even be sure it was listed."
3,"Fun read, once, I guess.","True fans of TV Nation will enjoy this book but you won't go back for quotes and lend it to friends like ""Stupid White Men"" and ""Downsize This!"" Just anecdotal details from the filming of the late, great ""TV Nation"", one of television's finest shows."
4,Fun read explains some of what went into TV show,"This book is a great, easy read. I read it in about three hours in an airport and on a plane. Short, light chapters explaining how many of the most famous ""TV Nation"" stories, episodes, and the show itself came to be. Appendices log every ""TV Nation"" episode and story that got on the air for fans that want that. Some interesting insights from the authors about entertainment, TV, politics and our social condition."
4,We need Michael Moore Moore than ever!,"As another unarmed American, I could not believe that NBC (and then Fox) would put Michael Moore's commie self on national television, but they did. When I saw this book I wanted to find out how this decision was made. I found out, and you can, too. This book is for people who think Dilbert has sold out, and that the proletariat will eventually rise up to overtake the means of production. Michael is gifted, persistent, and wrong about everything. His is the voice of a victimized America - offended and self-pitying, but with a good reason. Enjoy this book as much as I did. Once voices like his are silent, we're greatly diminished as a nation, TV nation or not. And you can get the communist party's website from the appendix for the price of the softcover."
2,just an episode guide,"I am a huge fan of TV nation and assumed this would be the book for me. I thought this book would be a sort of ""making of"". However all it does is retell certain segments from tv nation, with little extra added. Having just watched the all the tv nation episodes, this became tedious. I am unsure who this book is for, as if you like tv nation you find this boring, and if you don't like tv nation you certainly wont like this book."
2,an incomplete work,"This text reads like a loose collection of notes, not like a book. Nearly every page contains multiple footnotes, some of which take up more space on the page than the actual text. This greatly interferes with the flow when reading. If that information is truly that relevant to the text, then it should have been written into the text. Run-on sentences and poor grammar and editing further impede reading. It seems like an incomplete work.Some parts of this book seem to be a thinly veiled advertisement for the new Bibliotheca Alexandrina, which is of questionable merit: several decades and hundreds of millions of dollars for a grandiose building housing a mediocre library. This book leaves out those details, presenting an obviously biased view that calls into question the author's motivation as well as the remaining content.With apologies to the author, I cannot recommend this book."
4,An instructive approach to the ancient library,"I have just finished Derek Flower's book which I thoroughly enjoyed - it is easy to read, full of information about the Ancient Library of Alexandria and one of the few books to be so clear on the story of the lost library. An instructive and entertaining approach to this subject."
5,The True Germany in WWI.,"I find this book to be very well written. The author shows that Germany was by no means in good shape during the war.Towards the end of 1914 the author tells of the just begining, but never ending, problem with supply reserves. It shows how Germany was starving in 1918, and still Ludendorff attacked France. It shows that this lead to the German defeat. It tells you the many actions Germany could have, should have, taken to secure a reasonable treaty giving them territories taken in 1871 and Belgium.I find this book to be a very detailed look at the most overated man of the German army(Hindenburg, and the true leader of Germany(Ludendorff). From their rise to their ushering in of the Nazi party. A book fitting of 5 stars."
4,One of the principal publications on 20th century,"I would recomend this book to any history buff and also to general public who on armistice days pretend or impersonates ?? to shed ""genuine"" tear for impression of youth on imaginary toomb of unknown victim. Poppy vendors and perpetuators of myth - I would do it ,too! Again, and again and again.. for any king , country , yahwe or act of parliament. In time when glorification of something purposeless as break-down of human communication takes place by celebration of bloody sacrifice on small screen by Band of 1/2 brothers, Young lions , Pacifics or imposing scenarios for Ethernal freedom on Colombian and Afganistan coca and poppy cultivators , the book is sane reminder that war is something completely else than Spilberg's glorifications presents.Or CNN Pentagon spokesman/woman says."
5,at last!,"I have been reading Peter Orner's work in literary journals for years and am so happy to finally have it all collected in one volume. His stories are so quietly beautiful and devastating. The characters are alive, the prose is dead-on, the love of language apparent in every sentence. Orner's stories portray a very real world, flawed and heartbreaking, but joyous nonethless. These stories make me feel like people really are good underneath it all. I think Peter Orner is maybe my favorite contemporary short story writer. It might be a tough call between him and Stuart Dybek, but that comparison alone is the highest praise."
3,It's OK,"My wife loves this film. It was fun to remember the way we dressed and cut our hair back then. Also, the older technology used brought back some memories. I give is 3 stars because there are so many movies out there with better effects."
3,"My husband's movie, not mine.","I bought this for my husband's Kindle Fire. He likes the movie a lot. I do not, so I'm probably the wrong one to review this."
4,Oldie but Goodie,"It starts slow, but builds up to a good finale. After arriving at the entertainment complex of Westworld, our main characters explore the offerings and meet the real star of the show, Yul Brynner, dressed as the gunslinger. While they mix it up with staged bar fights and shoot-outs, things slowly go wrong at the complex and the robots begin to take on a life or their own and turn against the guests. The final segment is Brynner stalking Richard Benjamin, leading up to the much-copied ending. Not a great movie, but my kid enjoyed the second half. Spend the money and kick back."
4,Dated? Sure. Boring? No way!,I watched this with my 6 year old daughter last night. She was into it (with her short attention span) for the whole film. One pleasant surprise...it has a pretty good chase scene. I like chase scenes. Any SF fan will welcome this in his/her collection.A few good comic shots. Watch Richard Benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the Jail break.
4,westworld,"i always loved that movie,i have it as a tape vhs,so i knew that product .this is the reason i bought as a dvd."
3,Brynner saves this film...score: 60 (out of 100),"Yul Brynner will always be remembered as the robot gunslinger in Michael Crichton's WESTWORLD. His performance is the only thing that saves this movie from the trash bin. In fact, the last half hour is VERY creepy!!! Brynner's performance is so good that I got nightmares for many years thereafter - I was chased through underground tunnels by Brynner's evil gunslinger. THE TERMINATOR AND TERMINATOR 2 are much better films.Pros: Yul BrynnerCons: Everything elseSCORE: 60 (out of 100)"
2,A slow motion sleeper,"I remember being taken to this picture at least 3 times when I was younger, and after last night's viewing, I asked my parents ""Why?"".Yul is kinda going through the motions of hiss ""Magnificent Seven"" routine, James is kinda annoying, and Richard is really the wrong actor to hold this snore-fest together. Now if the dad from ""Eight is Enough"" was cast as lead, instead of the dufus minor role he had, then I could see the humor come to life, and maybe keep me awake long enough to care till the end, but it doesn't happen that way, and boy-oh-boy, is this movie SLOW!!Be warned."
1,WTH,Clearly there are hundreds of people who wish you ill. Do not watch this movie... It sux through and through.
1,"Great beginning, horrible end","The beginning of this movie is wonderful. The entire premise of an adult theme park manned by robots is very interesting, and the beginning of the film is effective.Unfortunately, the end is painful to watch. The movie degenerates from its strong beginning to a 20-minute chase scene between two characters. 20 excruciatingly boring minutes of walking/running through scenes cluttered with already dead people. Yawn."
4,YUL TIDE GREETINGS,"If WESTWORLD was made today, the guests would more than likely be taking virtual reality trips into their fantasy worlds. Given that this film is over thirty years old, however, one must credit author-director Michael Crichton with his imaginative premise. WESTWORLD is still an entertaining film, but seems a little dated in its concepts. However, it entertains and Yul Brynner as the gunslinger is icily effective. I would have liked to know a little more about James Brolin and Richard Benjamin's characters, so that more empathy could have been invoked for them. Some glaring plot holes, though: why would the park give the gunslinger a gun that could actually kill? Why would they trap their technicians in a room without emergency power or exits? And what happened to Dick Van Patten's sheriff character?A tidy little thriller, that over the years has amassed too much of a classic status. But it's fun while you're watching and I guess that's what matters most, right?"
3,Uneven but still good,"What's uneven about it? Well, let's see. The robots talk for a while in in full sentences then all they can say is ""draw"". The gun Yul Brynner uses suddenly has a light on it blinking words. Ridiculous! The visitors would see this on his gun and shatter the old western illusion. And there is a little luck in addition to many, many uneven elements. When Brynner goes after Benjamin it was just luck a robot horse was around for Brynner to hop on and pursue ashe'd have a hard time pursuing the also robot-horse riding Benjaminif Brynner had to walk.In spiteof many problems the film is still very genius. Music score, excellent way it is filmed and acted and all the great action and imagination. Still a winner."
4,A classic,"While its technology is dated, this remains a classic SF film dealing with the consequences of our technology getting beyond our control."
4,Westworld,"I had seen it before, and wanted it in my collection.- Act;ually got a dvd this time instead of blue ray"
4,70's Sci Fi,If you are a fan of the old 70's sci fi with no computer generated crap - you will enjoy this movie. I am a big fan of the 70's disaster/sci fi movies and this is a good one.
3,Great and not-so-great,"I loved this film when it was first released in 1973. In many ways it still works very well, especially when juggling the varied moral implications. I guess as audiences we have become more critical of details. As such, I noticed flaws this time that were significant: Why are the revolvers possessed by the guests incapable of firing at a warm target, but the one that Yul Brenner has can? Why does Brenner's infrared sensor allow him to ""see"" Benjamin's boot prints on concrete? They certainly do not emit any warmth. Worst of all, how does Brenner's ultra-sensitive infrared sensing manage to miss Benjamin on the gurney when Brenner walks by? Why does Brenner become an instantaneous inferno when touched by the torch in Medieval World. Are we to believe such an ultra-modern amusement park really has oil-fed torches?All of these errors combined to put me off a bit. Still, a good film and well worth revisiting."
5,As Good As I Remember,I love older movies and remember seeing this one at the movies. Got it on time and in excellent condition. The DVD played well and it looked at good as I remember it in the movies. I have watched it a few times and it still is one of my favorites.
3,Vintage Robot Scare Film,"This film is one of the classic stories about robots developing their own thinking, and revolting against their creators. A pretty good film, with a somewhat anticlimactic ending. While the premise is a good one, I think that there could have been more done with the interaction between robots and park guests after the revolt began. Overall though, not a bad movie."
3,science fiction from the 70s,"It was a long time since I saw Westworld for the first time. I remember finding it exciting with a lot of tention, thanks to the great performance of Yul Brynner as the menacing robot. It's still a nice movie, a bit dated today, but funny and near the end with some striking scenes. I don't find it that scary anymore, but the performance of Brynner is convincing."
4,Oh my!!,"I remember being packed up in the car and going with my parents (I was about 3 and they couldn't get a sitter) to see this movie at a drive in!Drive in's are, sadly, pretty much a thing of the past but I'm glad to see this movie's still around! This is the first movie I remember seeing, and if it's been stuck in my head for all this time then there's got to be something good about it!!"
3,"No flash photography, please","Average everyday joe is persuaded by a friend to come with him to amusement park styled in the old west where the people there are robots created to serve the guest anyway they see fit. Their vacation, however, is cut short when the robots go on a murdeous rampage and start killing the guests. Very good suspense flick is surprisingly violent (not including the ketchup blood) and unpleasent but very entertaining despite obvious short comings. Don't miss the SIMPSONS parody of this movie!"
5,"When no one has it, just go to Amazon.com","We have a machine shop and have to have a airtight, metal can to put dirty rags. None of the regular catalogues carried them any more. They only had plastic cans. I went on line to see if I could find them. Not only did amazon.com have them, but they were even cheaper and larger than the ones we already have. So we bought two (2)."
5,Quality in a product,"It's hard to find product these days than have some quality to them, this however is one that does. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs some fire protection for flammable rags used in one's garage next to a water heater."
2,21 Gal is MASSIVE and Absolutely Horrible Return Policy,"This 21 gallon version is half the size of one of those big, round Rubbermaid Roughneck trash cans you get at Home Depot. That is to say it is massive, and the photo appears too narrow and tall to be the picture of this item. It's more stout and wide. For anyone but the foreman of a massive manufacturing floor this thing is virtually useless.The construction actually looks pretty good and tough, and it reads ""Made in USA"" on the label. I rated it low because of the misrepresented photo and the return policy.IMPORTANT: RETURNS PROHIBITED. Amazon won't let you return this even if you don't use it because they classify it as a 'Health and Safety' item and prohibit returns on those items. There is absolutely no notice through the entire checkout process about this return policy."
4,as expected,just as described! Arrived quickly and serves it's purpose.Why do I have to type so many words about a trash receptacle?
4,home shop,"I have a home shop, wood/ metal. Build lots of picture frames, small furniture, and metalsmithing. this is about the right size for a small home shop to dispose of for oil rags, solvents and epoxies."
1,Blah!,I was hoping for images and unfortunately this book was a huge disappointment. Not only that the plates are printed poorly.....a waste of time and money....I would not reccomend this book to anyone interested in his work. Tobey's work is exciting and this book doesn't represent that at all!
5,Classic Rock Defined.,"ANGEL is a great band that only caught on within it's very hardcore fan base and that's all well and said, but the whole album and the ones before cement Angel in all our heart's. I only wish that the band member's try to get in touch with thier fan's that hung out all these year's waiting to hear whether on disk or LIVE! I think you guy's should consider a Tour there would be no problem booking the gig.I am not a crazy person, but as a very good bass player here in new jersey I feel you guy's should try one more time!"
3,helluva band,this is a cool record.hot on the heels of kiss this is not a glam band of the 70s.the best to songs on this is fortune and mirrors that is one haunting song great vocals in that one cool cd to pick up if your into the hard rock of the 70s
1,This music makes me feel strange.,"I bought this when I was in my early teens because I saw their pictures in Creem or Circus, and they looked so cool. Kiss was the band in black, and these were the guys in white. (Would be interesting to know how much influence the record company had in the choice of costume.) The music is interesting only because of what it says about the era. This is not good music. The delivery is just fine, but it's all so meaningless and soul-less. Much great music is one or the other, but not both! Still, I hope all these guys are doing OK; I'll never forget Angel."
5,'10' IS NOT EVEN HIGH ENOUGH FOR THIS BOOK,"This is by far the greatest book I have ever read. ""Weaveworld"" was my first Barker book, and I was absolutely mesmerized. Barker's imagination is equalled by no one. The thoughts, images, stories that came out of his head for this story are unbelievable. Barker is a master storyteller, allowing the reader to enter the story through the eyes of the characters. Everyone should read this book, everyone."
4,My 1st Barker attempt.,"It's a good book, though this reader here does not particularly like to venture into grounds of ""Magic n'Fantasy"", however, this book showed itself as a good one. There were the traditionally violent scenes this Liverpudlian is famous for conjuring, and good writing above all. Maybe, it was a tad too long, but I read it anyhow, and was not in the leastest disappointed."
5,The Most Visual Book I Have Read,"Reading this book is like taking a hit of acid and entering another world. Clive Barker has long surpassed any other fantasy/horror writer I have ever known of. This book is not a book-it is the doorway to another world-hence the title! I am ""HOOKED"""
5,I've Read It FOUR Times!,"This is one of the greatest books ever written. King and Koontz (the latter I despise) pale in comparison to Barker, and particularly, Weaveworld. I first picked up my brother's hardcover version about ten years ago, and actually gave up reading any other books, because I knew that no other book could ever be as good. Some of Barker's other books have come close, but Weaveworld remains my all-time best. READ IT! You won't regret it."
3,Not Barker's Best Book,"I was not terribly impressed with the story line. I usually love Clive Barker, but this was not his best book by any means."
5,"A mesmerizing weave of a tale. Busting at the seems with cosmicly lush landscapes,enchanting magic and unforgettable characters.","Having just finished this book minutes ago i'm somewhat at a loss for words in a sense.Weaveworld is certainly an epic dark fantasy that will leave the reader with hands nearly in a feverish shake as they turn the pages. An excellent book that i highly recommend.Though I found the beginning somewhat too slow and a little perplexing this story slowly began to unravel and before I knew it seized my imagination. Are their any downside to the tale? Well...yes. Their where things I felt held it back a little but my oh my is the book worth the journey you take. You'll certainly be for the better after diving into such a spell binding adventure filled with nameless Lovecraftian horrors,heavenly delights, and cosmic perplexities ever so breathtaking and bizarre.Read it!"
4,An excellent read,"Oh my, what a read. What an exhausting journey.I read this book filled with magic and horror, hope and lack of hope..and the always menacing Scourge, and felt all of these things.Suzanne carries the strength of mankind, and the magic of her grandmother.Calhoun is sincerity personified. And that is just the beginning, or would be if there was a beginning. Or for that matter and end.I think this was the story of what we each carry within ourselves. And the fear of losing it. I was left feeling lonely, bereft and yet hopeful. Is that possible? Is anything impossible? The story is also a reminder that no one of us can stand alone."
5,Barker's best; also why I don't read Barker anymore...,"Weaveworld must be recognized as perhaps the best contemporary fantasy work written in some time, and probably will continue so. I feel it is Barker's best fantasy, with the one outstanding quality being the prose itself. Written with true British leanings, it gave the story an extra mark of clarity and power. Sadly, this strength has lacked in all his other contributions. I've tried his other books, but was not impelled past a third of thier bulky lengths. With the exeption of perhaps Sacrement, which I haven't read yet, I've kept me away from Barker's novels. But Weaveworld, ultimately, delivers"
4,"The reviews are right, this is a great novel!","I almost gave up on this book, as I was having a hard time getting into it (as opposed to the other Barker novels I have read, which sucked you in quickly). I figured I should hang in there with the book, as so many of the reviews said I was going to enjoy this. I'm glad I kept going, as the book pulled me in after I got a feel for what was happening and got used to the idea that a carpet could contain a world within a world (very creative thinking on Barker's part). I really enjoyed this, and will read it again some time to pick up on all the subtleties I missed the first time through..."
5,This is my favorite story ever...,This is the best book I have ever read. Clive Barker is a master storyteller with a killer imagination!
1,Kindle Edition Needs Work,"I've been a fan for decades, but when I bought the kindle edition I was very disappointed. The invocation/motto text was smashed vertically down the page and for several pages. This was not the first time this has happened on rushed kindle books. I returned the book, as I did the others, for a refund. I will continue to do this with poorly formatted books."
3,Remarkable,"The writer has demonstrated the ability to something that is truly unique in literature, He takes the classic story of good fighting against evil and is able to give a unique and riveting insight. He creates an entirely new world which has been woven into a rug, The inhaiants of this wrld once shared their world with the human race. As the humans grew in size, the Seerkind were forced to flee from one place to anoher. In their new homes, they were able to weav their magic spells or raptures and, when danger was upon them, they returned to the Weave. There are numerous characters in this book and it is not always to keep track of them as they appeae to drop in and out of the narrative. Although this book is mot in one of my favorite genres, U am able to appreciate the ork done by the writer."
5,Will keep you up at night...try to find a previous edition,"There's a frightening picture in the 1980s edition of this book I found in my grandmother's boxes of books. My grandfather was always the fantasy type...and so am I. The picture is as rich and detailed as this book. Visit The Shrine of the Mortalities, marvel at the female power of the Menstruum, and help a London bloke make sense of life as reality unravels and knits up again and again. The cuckoo is a metaphor that turns up in Neil Gaiman's A DOLL'S HOUSE and Clive Barker did a forward for one of Gaiman's SANDMAN oeuvres."
3,Good but not Barker's best,"Weaveworld is a combination of horror and fantasy and is an interesting read (as almost all of Barker's books are) but it's not nearly as good as some of Barker's other works. Imajica is another tale of a fantastic realm (or realms) populated by Barker's rich imagination but it really WORKS. I would suggest Imajica first and foremost before Weaveworld and after reading Imajica, Weaveworld isn't worth reading. I see this book as a stepping stone in Barker's development- but one that might best be skipped by the reader."
3,Weaveworld,Clive Barker has an amazing imagination. This book is not my favorite but is worth reading.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Carpet world conflict.This is a bit more fantasy, a bit less horror. A bunch of supernaturals decide to hide themselves away in a carpet, hence the title. This is looked after by a woman. All goes well, except for that annoying trait that humans have: they kick the bucket eventually.The death of the rugminder leads to a conflict and chase for possession of this magic stuff, between our protagonist, and a human agent of the scary non-human woman Immacolata and her rather nasty agents. A bit on the dull side and not as good as that sounds, really."
4,Fall into the rapture of Weaveworld,"Cal Mooney looks into a carpet and in a split second, realizes that all his childhood dreams and fantasies were true. He's drawn into this magical carpet world which has awoken, and in doing so, has attracted the attention of the powerful evil forces that seek to destroy it.I was completely captivated by this story, drawn in from page 1 and kept rapt until the last line. I can't say much about character development, which is usually my #1 interest as a reader, because I was too busy being swept along into this magical world that Barker created. Not a short book, I wasn't aware of the length because I was so involved in the storyline and rooting every step of the way for the survival of this magical world."
1,Dispicable.,"Creepy News Network: ""CNN just interviewed a 28 yr old solider about to go on his 3rd tour of duty...a Ron Paul supporter...that Dana Bash pointed out how some people think Paul's ideas on military are dangerous...solider started complaining about picking fights with other countries and noted that Israel is capable of defending itself...then TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES!!!"" says David Schatz.http://youtu.be/Br5I3UcB5-A"
1,Something went horribly wrong,This is the first time I've ordered something for my Kindle and have received the wrong thing. I ordered the 6th Eclectic Reader and what I received was some kind of google scanned pdf of the 4th Eclectice Reader... it's a landscaped PDF that I can't even zoom or use how I intended to use.I've sent email to get my money back... we'll see if that happens.
4,A bit heavy handed but interesting,"I found ""The Phoenix Code"" to be a bit repetitive and heavy handed throughout most of the middle of the book, but the beginning was skillful enough to capture my interest, and the ending was exciting, well done and sufficiently rewarding that I can recommend this book.The characterization was very well done, with Megan, Ander and Raj quite fleshed out (an android pun?) and believable. The plot was not very complex, but I found it intriguing and worthwhile.All in all, not an important read, but a good one."
3,Average,"The romance of the story didn't bother me. I was more interested in the mystery of the story. Asaro keeps the ending a mystery almost to the very end. Once she reveals the 'who dun'it' the plot barrels along with almost no sense. Characters acting with seemingly one motivation suddenly reverse course. Minor characters become major factors etc. Overall a book that I wouldn't read again, but makes a good book to pass the time on say a long plane flight."
3,Not your average sci-fi,"Being different isn't bad, but I didn't enjoy this book. The mix of romance and sci-fi just didn't work for me. The only character I found interesting was the MindSim android Aris. In particular, the lead male character seemed very wooden. (Perhaps turn-around is fair play given how often male writers portray women as one dimensional) Regardless, the read was easy and the story fast paced. I just couldn't relate to it."
5,priceless,i can scarcely imagine a superior set of songs.perfect for listening while:1-starting a new relationship.2-ending an existing relationship.3-driving.4-pining over lost relationships.5-fretting over existing relationships.6-eating.7-crying.8-falling into a restless sleep.9-self-deprecation.10-witing online cd reviews.
5,I am jealous,"This EP is great. Its that simple. Great lyrics with harmony and a Knapsackish sound. Everyone says that knapsack should not have broke up, and I agree, but them doing so leads to NEW lyrics and also most important, NEW sounds with DIFFERANT bands. So all of those out there that are mad that Knapsack broke up, be happy that they decided to continue to make music. Snatch this and any other titles that they make up."
5,Seeing Stars,"This EP is absolutely phenomenal in my opinion! As a big fan of indie I think this album rates up there with the best. I really like the intensity in Blair Shehan's vocals, as well as all the instrumental work. Normally only one or two songs on an album will stand out, but on The Jealous Sound's EP, every single one is gold."
3,short but good!,"I have only two complaints about this album: the first is an criticism. Despite often being labeled as an emo band (and emo is short for emotional, is it not?) these songs are delivered with a lack of fervor. While musically and lyrically well-crafted, there seems to be little enthusiasm from the singers. In all fairness, I have heard that they are a good live band, so perhaps it is only on the recording that the band comes off as disinterested in it's own work.The second complaint is that the album is too short. Although the lack of emotion bothered me, I was still captured by the songs, especially by the lyrics, which are usually the main reason I find myself liking or disliking a song.In summary, it was a good debut though there are areas for improvement, and I'd like to see more from them in the future (emotionally and song-wise!)"
1,"The lead vocals are nothing to be ""Jealous"" of.....","This EP is dreadfully akin to Knapsack...except it is more mind-numbing and there is a lot less screaming and blairing (no pun intended) vocals. Blair Shehan continues to annoyingly over-enunciates his lyrics. I am no psychic, but I see a retirement requirement coming soon. I will give props to the drummer."
1,SO Played out it should have it's own funeral and be buried,The music on this EP would have been good - if the EP was released in 1995! Nothing new is accomplished musically or stylistically on this EP. Many bands before them have done this style better and EVEN THEY moved on to create music for the year 2000. Trying to be Radiohead coming from an EMO band doesn't work - ask all the others who tried it after The Bends came out. ... . This EP is lame.
4,I wouldn't be without it,I started studying Kendo with Dr Donohue after the purchase of this title. The class and thte book really compliment each other. I feel that this is as much about the art of the discipline as it is about the initial rudiments. I felt that this was a worthwhile read. It has definitely enhanced my practice.
2,Not a technical manual.,"This book is more a literary piece rather than a technical book on Kendo. I've read the book of Five Rings and I'd prefer the original work.I would reccomend this to those interested in the literature on interpretation of the ""Five Rings""."
5,New to the Blues start Here,Willie Dixon was the Driving force behind Chess records from putting pen to paper writing the music to teaching Howlin'Wolf the words to the music ...This boxed set is the sound of 1950's Blues
3,70's Glam Rock!!!!,"This is a fun 70's Glam Band. The music isn't the best or the worst. I do think that the band didn't get propper attention for its efforts though. It is a very solid 3-1/2 stars kind of a thing. If you like to listen to ""The Sweet"" you'll like this stuff. Their other albums fair about the same...good but not great."
5,It is a perfect fit for m daughter's dance practice.,I checked several sites for these shorts and could not find them. I believe it was because it is winter already. Excellent site to find items out of season!
5,Great to embarrass someone,"Due to the way the shorts fit, I would not recommend them for any male who does not wish to show off his ""Y chromosome."" However, if your goal is to purposefully embarrass a male friend, they are excellent."
2,Unattractive fit,I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform. They are a terrible cut. They look really like old school gym shorts.
4,Wrong size,"These were for my daughter. I ordered a small, the shorts arrived and were as advertised! however the bag said Small but the label on the shorts said Medium. Received a refund and reordered again. The second pair were sent quickly however same scenario......bag labeled small,shorts labeled medium. Talked to customer service at Amazon they advised NOT to reorder as most likely it would happen again. I ended up going to Sports Authority and getting them for less money."
4,"Comfortable, not very flattering","These shorts are true to size and comfortable, I'm fairly short but I'm not skinny so I ordered a small hoping they wouldn't be too tiny and they weren't. They're true to size but somewhat unflattering, I would never wear them out of the house."
3,"Soft, but loose!","I needed more running/work out shorts, and I couldn't find anything to really beat this price. I love soffes, specifically because they ""move with your body"". They're normally not too baggy, falling down, or not fitting in those ""awkward"" areas.Either I've gotten to be a smaller size, or these shorts are knock-offs...because these shorts don't fit me like my other soffes. They're awkwardly baggy in the crotch, the bum isn't defined, the legnth is a bit longer than the others (even when ""properly"" rolled up).The main pro is that the material is very soft and comfortable. So I could see myself wearing these to the gym, and maybe even to bed on a warmer night.So bittersweet? I guess."
2,Be careful,"The way the products are linked together is misleading. All the sizes on the page make it very hard to tell what are the junior and what are the kids sizes. thought I was ordering one, got the other. Price and quality where great though. I would have spent more sending them back than I spent buying them. So I have 3 pair of worthless shorts now."
3,"Nice quality, but sizing isn't too accurate","I wear a size 4 - 6 or small in misses' clothing or a 5 - 7 or small in juniors' clothing. Because these shorts are made of a 50/50 poly-cotton jersey knit, I ordered them a size larger than I normally wear--medium--thinking that even though they initially might be a bit big, they would shrink enough to be a good fit on me. Unfortunately, the medium was far too small for me. In fact, I'd guess that the medium would be a perfect fit for someone who normally wears a small. I have reordered the shorts in a large because they are nicely made and exactly what I need. My only complaint is that the sizing seems very inaccurate. They definitely run about a size smaller than other knit shorts in the same size."
5,Great item,These shorts were exactly what my daughter needed and they arrived very quickly. So easy to order them from Amazon.
4,loose,"If you are a skinny person, then the shorts would be loose on you, even when it is XS. If you lift up your leg, your undies would show."
1,WAY TOO SMALL,Is this a joke or what? These aren't an adult X-large they are a childs medium. It won't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $7.99 on a cleaning rag.
3,Careful with the size!,"Overall Im happy with the shorts... I mean, it's really a piece of fabric to cover part of your legs.I have to say thou, one must double clarify the size thing on these. I read the reviews on this product before making the purchase and ordered an L size and frankly they are too small, I'm a 4 and these shorts squeeze my love handles so, that I cant really wear them with a tight shirt without looking like a fatty.Other than that they'r fine.I would recommend them however make sure you get the size you need."
4,Perfect fit,I bought this to go with a Dora the Explorer Halloween costume but I still use them to work out. They are comfy and fit perfectly.
3,"Ok, nothing special","I needed to order these shorts for my daughter to fit requirements of a fitness program she was going through. They fit her a little shorter than pictured on the manaquin (why don't they use real people in these pictures?), and so they didn't meet the requirements.Material is just your basic, thin stuff. But they have held up ok and work well for working out/jogging. I could see how they would be good for 'camp gear' for cheerleading (or similar sports where you order matching gear for all the girls).., because, if you have to put in an order for several girls these might work as are very simple and have strechy waist.They are OK, nothing special.Update 1/30/12: I see they are using a human model now... yeah, they fit about like they do on her. I'm glad they are now using a read model. They held up for a few months before they ripped. They served their purpose."
2,EXERCISE OUTSIDE,"IT WAS MY MISTAKE. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS ITEM WAS ""JUNIOR"" SO OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T FIT. I DIDN'T HAVE A PACKING ORDER SO I COULDN'T RETURN THEM. I'LL FIND SOME SMALL PERSON TO GIVE THEM TO."
3,Misleading picture,"I ordered these shorts in black and rouge red and neither of them had an exposed waistband like the description stated. Otherwise, the size seems right, ordered a small, looks like a small womens. Just don't go by the picture."
3,may not last long,"looks good, cheap and may last for the summer but it may not last till the next summer. but for the deal its ok."
3,"Scratched, but replaced",The DVD's I initially received were scratched and the box looked worn. I emailed Amazon about a replacement and they were very courteous about it.
3,TRUST ME,"I am going to have to say this is by far the weakest season of 24 to date. Jack goes from being Rambo in Season 3 to a cross between Superman and John Wayne. Makes me sad to give any 24 product 3 stars but this one deserves it.Not only is it way over the top, the dialouge sounds like it was made by about 50 words, and 25 phrases placed in a hat. A writer grabs a handful then begins to arrange them and presto! We not have Jack saying. ""You're gunna have to trust me"" and ""I can't do that"" along with ""Thank you Mister President""Yeah, go ahead and let those quotes swew in your head.I will add though, that the side characters are pretty fun to watch this Season, so at least that's a plus"
4,Jack your life: Cause and effect!,"This saga explores the deadly threat and dark blackmail of a bunch of terrorists who have planned sinister confabulations in order to generate chaos and destruction in the country.One of the most interesting issues concerns the lack of authority and weak attitude of the vice President made President by reasons you'll see.Bauer will have to infiltrate himself into China Consulate to rescue a vital witness who will allow him to follow the lead to catch Marwan, the prime sinister brain of the conspiracy with catastrophic consequences for him.A treat all the way through, despite of the fact this is the weakest saga of the series until now."
2,"Love the series, but...",Disc 3 of 6 was damaged. Kind of a pain to be in hour #11 and have to stop until a replacement disk is procured!
2,hard to swallow,"A pretty gripping read back in its day (1966)--but in the 40 following its original publication, plenty of evidence has surfaced strongly suggesting that self-confessed killer Albert deSalvo WASN'T the real deal--or even close. (According to some reports, author Gerald Frank later admitted he'd been conned by deSalvo's bogus admissions.) Creepy reading--but file this one under FICTION."
2,Sensationalized and one-sided,"While this book is interesting reading, one can only wonder at the overly one-sided tone. This is not just a retelling of the facts. This author, while using true sources, obviously has a certain idea in his head as to how to present the material. Granted, all historical writing has a bias to it, but this one seems written more for the hype than the truth.Despite all that, the book is an interesting read and an informative look into the details of the horrendous murders and the detective work employed to find the killer(s)."
3,another one bites the dust,"i was reading this book all about this psycho who no one can catch that strangles chicks.the cops cant pin it down on anyone so they start getting thier suspects under hypnosis and seeing what theyd say then.but as everyone knows......post hypnotic suggestion is very powerful and thats exactly why albert desalvo ""became"" the boston strangler.just another cop book where someone goes down for something he probably didnt do at all.its pretty sick and graphic as the killer had a thing for kinky details,so be afraid!be very afraid!"
2,Not their best - and that's saying something,"James has always produced until this album. Laid is outstanding and their previous albums have more of a full connection, but this is definitely an attempt to assemble Booth's poignant lyrics with music...all in vain. If you like James and lyricist Booth, get the sheet and read that greatness!"
4,Great album. Pity most James fans are lonley losers,"Ugh. We don't wanna know which record you had your first time with. Records aren't meant for fu*cking. Girlfriends are. That's why she freaked out when she caught you with it. The sight of a boy doing his record would be unsettling for anyone to walk in on. Please keep what you do with your records on those long summer nights to yourself.But anyway, this is James' best album. ""Born of Frustration"" is the best song on the album. Very hummable. Or in batz' case, very fu*ckable to. batz even sounds even sounds like he was ""Born of Frustration"".If you think this review was uncalled for, please keep in mind the guy below detailed which album he lost himself to, which is much more innappropriate."
2,A Good Starting Point,"I have been doing research for a senior thesis on Southern Illinois regarding its involvement and possible support of the Confederacy in the Civil War. While this book was one of the first I read in an effort to go deeper into the politics and mindset of the south I found several items almost unneeded in terms of the fork lore and the way of speech. While it does provide interesting background imagery of the people when trying to get the facts these items seem to create hills which must be scaled in order to engage the material you want to read. Furthermore he goes on to reference people such as Wyatt Earp, who while born in Illinois only lived in this area for a very short period (2-3 years) before his family moved to Iowa where he truly grew up. While Allen's book does have interesting insight on many historical events he seems to get stuck in reliving the better times of the old ways of Southern Illinois."
1,Watch out for a fake!,"If you are really serious about Japanese PVC toys you need to do your research. When I bought this item it turned out to be a fake reproduction of the Enter Brain item. Enter Brain did have details about the fake and what to look for on their site as bootleggers (typically Honk Kong and Tai) had replicated everything down to the box art. There are a few tell tale signs to look for. Chances are, the seller doesn't even know they are selling a bootleg. Buyer beware? I kept the fake to remind me about what happens when you rush into something that looks too good. $99 for a fake...?"
2,warning,"CC has replaced this item with a slower version. The original had a cl rating of 2.5. This has a cl rating of 3.0. The smaller the cl rating, the faster each command is accessed. The picture is of the original chip."
3,Disappointing,"I love most of Georgette Heyer's books. However, I thought this one dragged a little in the middle. You could see exactly how it was all going to end from the very beginning, and the plot was a little boring. The sarcastic humor that is so prevalent in her other books was absent in Bath Tangle. Worth reading once just for the sake of reading a Georgette Heyer book."
2,One of these things is not like the others,"I like Heyer's novels, but this one is nothing like the many others I have read. The main characters are terrible people and the others are mostly either boring or terrible. Or both. A few amusing characters and situations don't make up for the bad. I barely finished it, which is unusual for me. My advice: give this one a miss. There are many more enjoyable Heyer novels out there."
2,My least favourite,"Leave this way down on your list of Heyer's books to read. Heyer's usual virtues of good writing and period detail can't make up for characters who are unpleasant (Rotherham), unlikeable (Serena), or just boring (everyone else, with the exception of Mrs Floore). The story is as slow as Serena finds life after her father's death. Read ""Black Sheep"" instead for a fun tale about romance in Bath."
4,a novel filled with terrific characters,"I adored all of the characters in this book. In many ways similar to other Heyer works, this one stood out to me because the cast of characters was so rich and deep. There are no real villains aside from Emily's mama (who cares about nothing but marrying her teenage daughter off to a wealthy peer of title and rank, despite the girl's wishes). I loved the sparring between the two main characters and was additionally moved by the star-crossed love story between noble Hector and gentle Fanny. Perhaps the most entertaining part of the story were the extraordinary efforts to which Lord Rotherham went to extricate himself from a regrettable betrothal he entered into in a state of vengeful anger. Hilarious man!"
2,Not one Heyer's better efforts,"Although Ms. Heyer is one of my favorite authors, and IMO her works transcend the romance genre, I found reading Bath Tangle an unpleasant experience. Hero and heroine are both self-absorbed, savage-tempered, sneering ... they richly deserve a lifetime of bickering with each other. This book has a mawkish, overwrought flavor -- quite missing are the humor and charm of Ms. Heyer's better works."
3,"An ok book, but not upto her mark","A good book, but not what was expected out of Heyer. As a reviewer has written above, I would have dearly loved to know the circumstances surrounding Lady Serena & Rotherham's first wedding & how it got broken off. The dialouges, as always, are witty & so is Lady Serena. But the story gives importance to unnecessary details & ignores the important ones. I feel that this isn't one of her best novels, but an ok one, nevertheless. It's not a book i'd recommend you to buy, but you could borrow it from the library & read it."
3,Long dragged out story,"It was easy for me to get into this book. Quickly I was hooked into the story line. However, I felt that the middle of the story really dragged on and on. Closer to the end it was again enjoyable. At many points in the book, I felt as though I was just trying to get through it, not savor it."
4,Bath tangle by Georgette Heyer,I am recollecting novels by Georgette Heyer and it is a joy to have this newer format. The old fashioned language is lovely and has through the years improved my English.
1,only worked for 7 months!,"Got this set last X-mas; used it approx. 30 times always with new ""AA"" Duracell batteries. I didn't use it for a month or so then in August I tried to play a CD (not a copy-an original!) and it only plays for the first 40 seconds then just spins and spins and spins.....no sound, no new track song plays, nothing!!! I am an adult who takes very good care of electronics....there is no explanation for why this CD just quit in such a short time! Sent e-mail to Coby cust. svc....no replies as of 2 weeks ago! Stick with the ""real"" brands!"
3,"Battery life, etc.","I purchased the Coby CX-CD1234 Portable CD Player with FM/AM Radio and Mini Speakers and wouldn't recommend it. The battery power didn't last long. The batteries recommended are rechargeable, but the cord to recharge them doesn't come with the unit and is an extra expense. I wrote to the company regarding this and never received a reply. Also, the instructions aren't very good.Regarding the accessories: I've purchased headphones at dollar stores that weren't as cheap as the ones that came with this unit. I wasn't expecting Bose quality, but I wasn't expecting the buzzing sound they make, either. The speakers are just as bad. I gave an overall rating of 3 because the CD player itself seems to do well if you use more expensive headphones. I will try very hard never to purchase another Coby product again."
1,"*PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CD PLAYER*","I bought this portable cd player based on the reviews and the affordable price. First, it's super sensitive, just pressing the buttons causing the cd to skip. The digital display is so faint I can barely see anything and I'm still trying to figure out where the AM/FM radio is located on this thing. **I beg you, please do not waste your money on this cd player**"
1,What a piece of crap!,"I have not baught this cd player, but I do have experience with them. I have owned at least three of them in this price range and I am distrought about the lack of options that come with this item. I looked at the technical information on this, and saw some of the basic functions like hold, and resume as a no. If I were you I would not purchase this cd player."
1,Never again,"I too bought this lamp thinking I was getting an OEM replacement lamp for my NEC LT240 projector. This lamp only had 40 hours on it when it stopped outputting any light whatsoever.I have arranged for an RMA but would have preferred to have had a lamp for the next 2000 hours of enjoyment. Now I am more likely to spend my time searching for a different projector, as I cannot seem to find a reliable replacement lamp for the system I have now.Completely disappointed. First I bought a Chinese fake from eBay $200), I thought Amazon would be more reliable. Goes to show, you never know."
5,A MASTERPIECE,"This is simply a Masterpiece. And to set the record straight, this was produced by Michelle Shocked herself, contrary to what has been said before, the only song produced by Don Was is Come A Long Way (brilliantly produced by the way). Recorded in interesting places like an antique store, a Riverboat and some living rooms,with some of Michelle's own heroes. A lot of history in this record that tells you that ""bluegrass music is not only white poeple's music, but black people's music as well"" I have been listening to this record since '92 at least once a week. Can't live without it."
2,A waste of money.,There is only one good song out of the entire CD- Strawberry Jam. This CD will be donated to charity for write off.
1,Don't bother!,I bought this for my Sony HDR CX 500. It was worthess because itdid no focus at the camera zooms. I sent it back and bought the Soundy lense which i a littl big but works fine.
3,Too much detail,"A mass of research with the result that there are too many names, ships and events to follow the trail. One can see where Patrick O'Brian got a lot of his themes, even personalities. But a good, if tiresome read. Particularly if you are a marine history buff."
3,"This is history, not a story.","If you are looking for an adventure at sea in napoleonic days you should read Lewis and Pope and Kent, Showell and O'Brian.If you want to find out where these writers found their inspiration look no further than this book.It is an account of the dashing frigate captains and small flotilla commodores who fought the small actions of the Napoleonic years. And there are hundreds of them.Because there are so many actions this book does not flow easily. It leaps from description to description, and there is not room to map each engagement.However, the research is excellent, the ships are well explained and for the budding historian or writer this book is an excellent resource for the library shelf."
2,"Could be much, much better","I was ecstatic when this book arrived in the mail; a tour guide for Wisconsin's fascinating geology was like a dream come true. Unfortunately this book is not nearly as readable as it should be. It is far too heavy on scientific names and proper nouns, reading more like a dry list of facts than a guide to the dynamics of geology. Compare this to the WPA Writer's Guide to Wisconsin and it doesn't hold a candle.Normally the folks at UW Extension are masters at making their expertise accessible to anyone, but they sure didn't do that here. I'm going to keep reading through the book because I want to learn the information inside, but it's a rough slog. Here's hoping a better writer attempts the same project soon."
2,Beware of bias,"It is clear that the authors of this book question labeling what they consider normal childhood behavior with a mental illness. If you are the parent of an ADHD child, their stance is insulting. ADHD is a physiological disorder disrupting executive functioning in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - brain scans have been done to show the underarousal in ADHD patients in these very areas of the brain. ADHD is being increasingly diagnosed because as a society we are increasingly requiring children to unnaturally sit at attention for longer and longer periods of time - 100 years ago, children did not sit at desks all day long. I encourage alternative treatments to the disorder - many random controlled trials have been done on homeopathy, essential oils, biofeedback etc. But this is a real disorder - all you need is to live with a child who has it to understand."
5,FANTASTIC SOUNDTRACK!,"Jeff Beal offers Nawang a great backdrop of music for his spiritual sounds. Although there are parts that include sounds from the movie and voices, this album is a great one to inlcude in your collection..."
4,bongos and a2yr old,this works way better than those plastic ones.. it has way better tone and is more tollerable to listen to for me that a dull thud sounding hunk of plastic.this is closeer to or is a real instrument and i'd rather my kid play with a scaled down version of the real thing vs. a lame imitation.definately worth a look if you think the same way.
5,Great quality drum,"This drum is a great size and quality for my 7 year old son. It's well made and has a wonderful sound. It has the sound of a real drum, not a child's toy. My son is very happy with it and I think it'll last a very long time."
3,"A Masterpiece...la la la lally la la... well, not really.","Is there a novel of greater literary merit than Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings""? YES, the harrowing yet subtle ripoff ""Bored of the Rings"" surpasses even the original masterwork in imagination and characterization. Names are altered to give them greater significance (Frodo->Frito, Sam->Spam, etc.) But the real masterstroke is condensing the epic into a mere 160 pages (for those of us whose attention spans have decayed from TV and computer games). And the poetry is... oh, who am I kidding? It's a load of crap, but there are a few laughs. If you take Tolkien too seriously then you might want to skip it though."
5,Shakestoor It Isn't....,"But it is rollicking good fun! I bought Bored of the Rings years ago, shortly after I had read the Lord of the rings, and I was rolling on the floor laughing, like the Nozdrul in the book were when Stomper was doing his insane antics.Of course, some who think Tolkien's work is a sacred text will be offended, but I think Tolkien himself would be honored by the parody. This comes from one who has been brought up reading MAD magazine, and knows the ways of good parody. The jokes are late 60's and are now quite dated, but it is still good.The authors were lovers of Tolkien's work, and intended it to be a good-natured poke at it. Goodgulf the wizard is delightfully funny as he tries to be serious, but nobody is taking him seriously. But as he said when Frito was eyeing possible exits, ""Cease thy eyeing of possible exits,..."" and read this book!"
3,Wander far off of the beaten path,"Lampoon aficionados, look no further! If you enjoy Tolkien,and also enjoy alternative viewpoints, consider this classic."
2,So so.,Read. Laughed. Yawned. Chuckled. Fell asleep. Finished.Can't say much more. This book had a few funny spots -- a few. So there.
2,"Waisted money, no laughs","Tolkien's books are amongst my favorites so i was looking forward to read this parody. What a disapointment! Not one laugh! Well ... i smiled 3 or 4 times. I laughed more at some parts of The Lord of the Rings! The authors simply rewrite the characters as complete morons and losers and tell absolutly the same story as Tolkien. Not one bit of originality! Waisted money, ... and unfortunatly a waist of time!"
1,J.R.R Tolkien,"First of all, I do not even give this book a star, I give it no stars at all I only put it that way because there are no ""no stars"" in the menu,second, I agree with Gloin of Bag's-End, J.R.R Tolkien wrote 4 simply glorious books and I sincerely do not believe that Mr. Tolkien the true ""father of fantasy"" deserves to be mocked or parodied in this or any other way, I belive that those who like this book are showing disrespect for the man who virtually created the fantasy genre. Let us hear it for J.R.R Tolkien!!!!!!!!!!"
1,No stars,I don't think that the lord of the rings should be turned into a parody or into other thing... it's great and Imortal as it is.
4,christmas gift to my self,I have not had the time to seat down and read this yet. I was pleased with the prompt delevery I recivied as this was ordered a couple days before Christmas and came the first delevery day after Christmas.
3,wow!! quite a controversy,"I've gone through the reviews and see a lot of raves and a smaller but significant number of scornful dislike. I find myself in disagreement with both these extreme points of view, probably because, while I recognize its humor, I prefer something more subtle. I enjoyed the book 40 years ago in the light of those times in which it was written and it has some amusing elements which rise above the general trend of the book. There are many tomes I have read and enjoyed, and which I find occasion to reread and enjoy. This book is not one of them. If you are thinking about getting this book, consider reviewing the reviews first to get an idea whether you would likely give it 5 *'s or 1."
4,This is one of the most funniest books ever written!,"I recomment this book to anyone who won't take it seriously. I haven't red the English version, but in the finish version all the names were so funny that every time I compare them to the original ones, I can't help smiling, or laughing. Everything was turned abolutely upside down! Songs! Yes! The were incredibly crazy! But anyone who thinks LOTR as a Bible, don't even think of reading this book. -Simon the Half Elf"
5,Thought this was out of print,"A bit dated, and probably only really funny for those who have read Tolkien, but unquestionably one of the funniest books ever written. From the picture, it looks like they've changed the cover from what it used to be in the olden days. That's too bad, because the original cover was a parody in its own right of the old Lord of the Rings paperback covers."
1,A bit too gross,"I like parodies as much as the next person, but this book is just too much of a gross-out to be funny.My dislike for it has nothing to do with how big of a Tolkien fan I am; I'm a huge Star Trek fan, and I loved Star Wreck. I have a degree in English History, and I loved 1066 and All That. That's why I read this book, because parodies of things I'm extremely familiar with are the best kind! I was disappointed to find that this book goes for the lowest common denominator to get laughs: Dildo Bugger? Come on!"
2,Bleh...Yuck...Ick...,"I did not like this book at all. I'm not a fan of Tolkien's trilogy (though I loved The Hobbitt), but loved the movie trilogy. I found the writing in this to be sophomoric and many of the lines to be idiotic. I don't recommend this for anyone who is NOT a fan of the written version."
1,!!!,"IN THE NAME OF ELBERETH! The Lord of the Rings is a beautiful, magical story, and I do NOT approve of people making stupid parodies of it! I hope that not all people in the world have such a twisted sense of humour! I mean, even the names utterly stink! Frito? Pepsi? And how do you get ""Pepsi"" from ""Pippin"" anyway?!?! I am utterly disgusted!!!"
1,s---u---c---k---s,"I can't believe ANYONE would make a parody out of The Lord of the Rings! The thing wasn't even funny! It is as disgraceful as ""SpaceBalls"" was when it tried to make a parody of StarWars. Tolkien was a genius, and one of my most favorite authors (the others being CS Lewis, Jack London, and Douglas Adams) and his great work DOES NOT deserve this kind of s***! If you want humor, read The Hitchhiker's Guide."
1,Can anything else be a bigger load of garbage,Please can a book get an more stupid. By my opinion this book is a sorry excuse for a book. Anybody who reads the lord of the rings should see my side of this book.
1,SKIP THIS!,"SKIP THIS! This is obviously a very bad book. Most of the jokes aren't even funney, even if you've read the origanal book and understand all the jokes! I do NOT recomend this book escpecially if your a Tolkien fan!"
1,I wouldn't even think of reading it,"Any author that pokes fun at Tolkien's masterpiece ""The Lord of the Rings"" should be horsewhipped!I haven't even read this book(just flipped through it)and I still have no intent to do so.It's not that I don't like parodies,in fact I love them(like ""star trek"" parodies)but Tolkien's books should absolutly NOT be ridiculed!"
1,....without comment,"yeah sure like MINIMUM 100 WORDS, like i have the time to write all that mm... I DONT THINK SO PAL not this time nor another nor here nor anywherel, do you understand me young man??!! jeje, bye (i hate the man who wrote this book, how those he dare to interfere to magnificent tolkien???!!!) babay"
1,This book was horrible!!!!!!,"This book was an arrogant criticism of Lord of the Rings. If the writer felt that Lord of the Rings was so insufferably boring, they could have put the book down and read a different one. Perhaps in their ignorance they didn't understand that The Lord of the Rings was a bedtime story told by Tolkein to his children. I find it to be quite fascinating and I think that the author of the carping book ""Bored of the Rings"" should try to accomplish more reasonable and less immature things than writing a foolish book making light of another man's brillance."
3,"Lese-majeste, but laughable","The first time I read this book, as a young Tolkien fan, I was horrified and unable to finish it. How could anyone scrawl such graffiti over the runes of Middle-Earth? I picked it up again ten years later as a more mature and sophisticated reader---and laughed until I choked like an overfed boggie. (If there's any such thing.) Yes, Tolkien's high, bright, puissant fantasy world is worth cherishing, but if anyone had to lampoon it, the Harvard boys were the ones to do it. The humor is a little dated, but the original LOTR was at its height of popularity in the States during the '60s and '70s, and the acid-edged parodies of Tom Bombadil and Gandalf benefit from it. The raunchily revised Bilbo and Eowyn are timeless. Is it worth your money? Yes, if you ever spent more than five minutes wondering why there manages to be no libido or sex whatsoever in LOTR's few romances."
5,Classic National Lampoon,"As a long time LOR fan, I first read this many years ago, shortly after it's initial publication. I found it highly amusing at the time. Time has taken some of the luster off as many of the references are to products a large number of current readers will be unfamiliar with. In spite of that it remains a very witty and amusing book and a quick read. Still enjoyable after all these years!"
4,Amusing satire,"If you take Tolkien's originals as Holy Writ, then just turn around and run. This will look about as witty as painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa, or maybe less.But, if you have the sense of hunmor of a twelve year old boy, someone not too old for potty jokes and with a fair reading vocabulary, you'll find it a hoot. A few of the cultural references have aged badly in the forty-plus years since the original publication, but the authors add footnotes for people too young to remember Brylcreem and such.I enjoy the originals, but I like this too in its own way. The originals stand so tall and strong on their own that something like this really has no power to tarnish their image. So, go ahead, laugh a little. I promise you, the original texts won't even notice.-- wiredweird"
2,Just Not Funny,"For the first 40 pages, Bored of the Rings was amusing. After that, it just became (ironically) tedious and repetitive. Yes, the names were clever, and the fantasy genre could stand to take itself a bit less seriously. But for me, it just didn't work. As a stand-up routine, it would be great, but a full-length book needs something more than [adult]-toy jokes to keep itself rolling..."
2,As boring as a college reunion,"I thought this book was a scream when I first read it in college in the 1970s. We had a whole cult built around it, much like kids do around ""South Park"" or ""Beavis & Butthead"" today. However, on re-reading it last month for the first time since those days, I was reminded of the old axiom that ""you can't go home again."" Virtually all the humor fell flat, even though I still understand the many references to now-forgotten people and consumer products."
2,Too much,"The book could have been written better, without the extra ludeness and idiocy. Some of it was clever, but the authors could have frankly done a better parody. I can understand people who like this book and LOTR, but I have read LOTR and find this in no way compares too it. A little too disgusting, and it turns the characters into mush. The original was a fantasy epic and although I dont hold it Sacred and all that, this spoof was just a bit too silly. True humour should be written without the extra slapstick comedy. Wordplay and Satire this is not."
1,You are better than this,Highly overrated. Humor fans deserve more. Very lowbrow and unfunny compared to books like Hitchhikers Guide.
2,Waste of time,"I like a good sex/dick/fart/drug joke as much as the next guy.. but it has to be done well, and this book just isn't. Granted, it has a couple brilliant moments where you can't help but laugh, but it's not worth all the filler. If you want a good bit of rotten comedy, go watch some South Park or Beavis and Butthead because, honestly, that's more sophisticated. The humour in this is dated and just isn't very good (it's like the Air Farce is to Rick Mercer). Plus, this is a kids book we're talking about(albeit a very good one). As far as I'm concerned any book that could be read by children should be off limits for this kind of parody.*"
2,Lame and not very funny at all,"I'm sure that most who read this book are fans of the ""Lord of the Rings"" as I am. The idea of a parody seemed clever to me back in 1993 and I thought that I should buy this book to complement my complete set of Tolkien's brilliant works. I couldn't even finish half of it. It really has very little to recommend it."
2,A Comment...,"I have a good sense of humor, and I love a good laugh, but this is not my kind of book. However, I could not help but notice a comment made in a review a little farther down the page. The writer claimed that without this book, Tolkien would have long been forgotten. I could't disagree with his statement more. Most of my friends and I have grown up loving Tolkien and his Middle Earth, yet I had never heard anything about this parody. There is a reason Tolkien has been dubbed ""The Father of Modern Fantasy"". He was the first author to sucessfully take classic myth and legend and shape it into the fantasy novel. The genre of fantasy could not be where it is today if Tolkien hadn't paved the way. There will always be room in people's hearts for his stories.In contrast to that statement, I believe it is the other way around--this parody could not have existed without Tolkien. =)"
1,This isn't funny: it's an insult to everything I believe in!,"Number one: the parodies are tired and predictable. Changing Bilbo to Dildo (Just sick, if you ask me, and could you have made that a little more subtle?) and Frodo to Frito is something even a baby could have come up with. Number two, as a devoted Tolkien fan, I was insulted by some of the things that were clearly meant to be funny. It could have been a little more subtle. I love LOTR and I can't stand anyone mucking it up and trivializing it and ridiculing it! The authors must really hate Tolkien to defile his work like this!!!! They as good as stripped him of his clothes and put him out on the street for public ridicule! This is the worst book ever. I could puke!"
1,Aappalling...,"This is one of the most disgusting books I believe was ever created. Lord of the Rings is (other than the Bible) one of the greatest books ever published. Tolkien had a brilliant mind unhindered by perversion(which this book is filled with). I wish this book had never been created. It is an insult to the most perfectly written story of all time, and I don't see how anyone could find it humorous."
5,very silly book,"I thought this was an enjoyable read and laughed out loud. It does stick to the story line pretty good. For a good time, read this book if you like parodies."
2,Worth Reading,"I bought this book when in came out in 1969 and enjoyed it then. By then I'd already read The Lord of The Rings a couple of times and loved Tolkien's work. I thought this book funny and enjoyable and, while not high literature, I do think it worth reading if you're a true fan of the Lord of The Rings. Since then I've read LoTR probably a dozen times, but I still find this book amusing.As another reviewer, J. D. Heise says, this book ""takes Tolkien's trilogy(sic) and spins it, flambes it, purees it, folds, spindles and mutilates it"", but, unlike the recent movies that did the same thing, it was intennded which makes it much easier to enjoy. If you're a diehard fan of the LoTR book, buy something totally useless (this book) and have a laugh."
5,Not for the Hobbit-Lovers,"This book is a must-read for those of us who find Tolkien's epic tedious as well as smarmy and twee. This parody is, as a parody, excellent, with even the characters' names laugh-out-loud funny, and it follows the plot of the original closely enough to demonstrate just how padded and over-written Tolkien's books were."
4,"A slow start, but funny book","I listened to the audio book on a road trip. At first I was bored and just about the time I was ready to give up on this book it picked up and I found myself laughing continuously. It turned out to be not only entertaining, but it left me wanting more in the end! I'd recommend it!"
4,If you love Raymond - you'll love this book,"Like most comedians that have made the move from stand-up to small screen, Everything and a Kite rehashes some of the topics and story lines from Ray Romano's show but I must say that it is still funny.Ray mixes up his feelings of inadequacy with the joys and pains of being alternately a child, single, married and a parent. I laughed aloud several times while reading the book and had to repeat several stories to those around me while I was chuckling.My only gripe is that I wish the book were longer, Ray Romano spent much of the book changing the fonts and joking about having to write filler (which served a dual purpose) as well as hemming and hawing and apologizing for things until he finally spit the joke out. I did love the footnotes through out the book.All in all, a very quick but very funny read!"
5,Stand-up funny. It's a family funfest !,"Ray is now a familar face. You can't help but picture his t.v family playing the real-life Romanos. Ray has a talent to pick the little everyday things and make them funny. They're funny because they're true. Funny, and an easy read."
1,"Like the show, it's ""not about the kids"".","I forgot to assume that this book, like the TV show, is not about the kids. I found the book generally disappointing and was distracted by the author's use of profanity."
3,Funnier in the beginning,"Dry, sarcastic humor abounds...and if that's what you appreciate, then you'll enjoy this read. I didn't need all the swearing and sexual comments though. Still recommendable though."
5,Very Funny,"Everything and a Kite is the funniest and most entertaining book I have ever read. Granted this is the first story/novel/book I've read willingly since 7th grade (I'm a H.S. senior), but I know a good book when I see it. I can't really relate to the married life with all the kids, but it's hilarious to read about his take on these things. Ray's stories about his twins and his wife are entertaining and really seem true to him. That's what I like. It's just him. I didn't even know an audio book existed, but I'm definitely going to pick that up right away. And also, his cd Live at Carnegie Hall is awesome, though much of the material is in the book, it's still great to hear him do stand up."
2,Bill Cosby he's not.,"After 209 pages of, ""I have to fill 209 pages"" I was very unimpressed - and these are double spaced pages so us readers really only get 104 1/2 pages. Only twice did I actually laugh to myself with maybe 4 chuckles. I enjoy comedy, but mostly when it's funny. This book read as if it were put together in a hurry so that Ray Romanno can now add ""author"" on his resume'. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it, but my thoughts while setting it down were: ""This book is well worth $4.95,"" and ""Hey, anyone can write a book."" Yes, I will continue to watch his TV show."
2,A Woman's Perspective,Another reviewer had concerns that he would appear chauvinistic for saying the book was a regular guitar book with girly designs. I have to say he's not being a jerk. I picked up the book wondering what unique insight it had for female guitar players and was a little put off to find that they drew hearts and flowers all over the pages and then called it a girl's method. It's insulting.
5,great collection of memories,"a wonderful collection of memories of Pretty Shields life- as soon as you start reading you will love her. A strong, smart woman from the last generation of native people who lived by the way of the earth. you should read this!"
3,A little disappointing.,"Based on the title and the editorial reviews, I was expecting (and hoping) to read about Pretty-shield's life as a healer, and more about the customs of her tribe. Instead, a lot of the stories were about things she did as a child and teen, mostly how she got into trouble and silly things she did with friends.On the positive side, it's an easy read, and would be a good introduction to Native American life."
5,Very touching,Was referred to read this book and while the beginning was a bit lagging it picked up and turned out to be worth the time. I learned much and have re-read it as one of my favorites.
2,Misleading,"This album certainly delivers on something, just not what I wanted. For those who think of ""bayou"" music as cajun, accordian/harmonica/thumping bass type stuff, as I was looking for, only about 1/3 of the tracks here deliver. The rest is the same type of rockabilly/honkytonk stuff that I don't necessarily associate with ""bayou"" - more like ""anywhere in the 50's, moreso in the South."" I was looking to inject some cajun into my cd collection. I'll keep looking!"
2,Not worth the money!,"Looking at the high praise this mediocre recording receives in the other reviews, I'm wondering whether I listened to the same one. I bought this recording with high hopes, but having never listened to her voice - I regret it. The material she performs is good (if somewhat standard), but her voice is really...weird. It has a Beverly Sills (past the golden years) wobble in it that she seems to think is a healthy vibrato. I know she was pulled out of Indiana U early for a Met contract, and I think they did her a disservice - her technique is horrible. She does have good control of her pianissimi, but as a whole, the recording is most disappointing. In the Rach, her fortes are frighteningly bad, almost embarassing. How does this woman sing at the met?"
5,"facts, facts, and more facts","Sharon O'brian replaced the juicy radical language of most books written on American Indian-US government relations such as Custer Died For Your Sins with the text of acts of congress, Supreme Court decisions, and presidential administration policies. Included also is a chapter on European land claims and conflicts that arose between them and the Indians and amongst themselves. It is none of it controversial, all of it educational. It's an excellent guide for anyone claiming to be a U.S. historian."
5,Very scary music,Hi my name is Ellis and I really liked this cd. It was funto listen to and was really scaryy. I think you shuld listen to it too. My friends daddy says its good for me because I'm a bad seed he says He does not want him to play with me anymore. This band is good! Sometimes they make spooky sounds for all songs. I like the song where you can hear the werwolf howl Its so scary I get goosebumps!! I caN'T wait until Halowen when i can play this at my house and scare little boys away when they here werwolfs coming after them!!
5,Mr. Stueben wins!,"Precalculus QuizM. Stueben (March 5, 2003)IT HAS come to my attention that some students do not like my quizzes.

And I personally attest that Dan Tran and Mr. Stueben are two people who will never lie if they can manage it. And this book will do you good to read."
2,For people who LOVE Christmas and giving beyond their means,"Perhaps I am NOT the right person to review this. I read this book by chance, having seen it while shopping. (Esther's Gift)The ONLY reason I bought it, is because both my parents had just passed away, and this was the first Christmas that they were gone. My mother especially was NUTS about Christmas, and her name was Esther...that's why it caught my eye.I opened to read it, and found Esther's husband (in the book) was Gene...YIKESThat is my FATHER's name!The story, paralleled how my parents viewed Christmas. I.E. Father counting the cost of the gifts Mom wanted to give.Not the way I view Christmas at all, but WEIRD!!! the way it paralleled my parentsand included names of our family and close friends. I'm pretty sure my familynever heard of Jan Karon, the author."
3,Very LITTLE book.,Love the Mitford series but this LITTLE book didn't amount to much. Gave it 3 stars because it did have the famous Orange Marmalade Cake recipe.
3,"Small book, nice story, big price tag","Hi: I really enjoyed Karon first four or five books, but now it seems, she is asking a great deal of money ........for very few pages in a book. The stories are cute, not great and cost way too much. I think she needs a rest and the money isn't everything.............and the first few books I sent as gifts, I recommended highly, so now I am very disappointed."
1,What Happen ???,"What happen to the Jan Karon I used to love to read? Last year I was a little disappointed in THE MITFORD SNOMWAN but decided all of her books couldn't be perfect since the others were so great.However I was more disgusted than disapponted when I read this year's Christmas book.Personally this book was just a waste of time and money. There was no plot, no meaning. Please don't tell me the author is on her way out. Hopefully we will see more of the earlier Jan Karon-not anymore such as this one or the MITFORD SNOWMEN.Sorry to be so critical but that's the way I feel. Nex time I will be more selective before buying any more Jan Karon books.What a shame."
1,Waste of time,"I have never read a Mitford story and now I know why. I think this book was boring and had a really weak storyline. Who actually sits down and calculates their ""time"" into the cost of making a present? I am just glad that I checked this out at the library and didn't pay for it. If I had know how short this story was I could have just read it in the check out line!... Save your money for a recipe book that has more that one recipe in it!"
3,Good stocking stuffer,"It's difficult to rate a book such as this because it is only 37 pages long and takes a matter of minutes to read. It is recommended for fans of the Mitford Series, since readers will already be familiar with Esther Bolick, the main character, who bakes Mitford's favorite cake, The Orange Marmalade Layer Cake. Esther is contemplating her yearly baking schedule when she decides to have her husband Gene calculate the cost of each cake. She is appalled by the final figures, and vows to cut her giving list severely. As she listens to a Christmas carol, she begins to realize that the true cost of giving--and not giving--goes beyond monetary considerations."
3,"Slight, but enjoyable read","This is an attractive book which would be a nice little ""extra"" present for someone who enjoys the Mitford series. I have to caution potential buyers, though, that the story itself can be read in about 10 minutes, and may appeal most to readers familiar with the Mitford characters (if you're familiar with their various personalities, it adds to your enjoyment of the story--Karon doesn't have room here to go into any character development or much detail about anything.) I think it is worth Amazon's reduced price, but I wouldn't pay full price for it, even if it does contain the recipe for Esther's famous cake!"
1,Not much but a recipe.,If you are a fan of the Mitford books get this from the library if you care to read it. You won't need to check it out. It can be easily read in 10 minutes. If you have never read the mitford books but want to DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS. Unless you are familiar with her characters nothing about this ultra short story will be in the least interesting. I know them well and found it only barely diverting. I made it and the much talked about cake is every bit as good as the build up. But if you wish to make it get it from the library and spend the 10 bucks on a book that REALLY IS A BOOK!! This sad to say is a recipe.
1,Ten minutes,"It shouldn't take the average reader more than ten minutes to read this book, cover to cover. That's not an exaggeration. And as such, this book just isn't worth the price, any price.Esther argues with herself over the cost of her locally famous cakes, which she gives to the deserving, especially at Christmas. And she decides that the price she pays is worth it. That's it.If you must read this, get it from the library. You can read it there too."
1,Disappointment,"I have been a great fan of Jan Karon & her novels. This book, however, was extremely disappointing. There was no plot or feeling of Christmas spirit. Too short, no depth of character, wonderful recipe that I will never bake."
3,An acoustic feel-good record,"This is an acoustic feel-good record with their voices in focus. It sounds like background music at a pub and ""Suddenly Mary"" is better than the original version.Victoria Bjuringer"
3,How to teach Suzuki piano,This 20-page book is a short introduction to the philosophy behind the Suzuki method of teaching piano. It gives very general guidelines on how piano teaching should be tackled. It provides the reader with a general idea on the Suzuki method but it is not very useful for someone interested in learning how to teach piano. It does not include any specifics and merely refers to the other books of the author about the method. The author's statements are not well justified and are only bases on the personal experience of the author. Some of them make sense but not all of them. It contains no figures nor music scores.
1,Would put an insomniac to sleep,"This movie reminds me of some old VHS tapes I have been tricked into renting which never made it into a theatre or even TV. Only buy it if you have trouble sleeping. It is boring beyond belief and the transfer quality is worse than a cable TV picture. Jigsaw is a good name for it - it looks like they made it in pieces and then threw darts to decide how to put the scenes together. It is sad that with so many good movies that haven't made it to DVD, someone chooses to market this kind of junk. I guess they only have to sell a few of them to turn a profit, since it looks like it cost nothing to produce."
5,Gritty crime thriller,"Ok, let's face it, it's a B movie. But,I think it could be a cult hit. It's well shot, the cinematography was excellent. Script wasn't too bad, with some well crafted dialog. I thought it was more like a film noire crime thriller than an action film. Real good who-done-it. I'd like to see what this director does next."
1,good title bad movie intresting idea,this started out good right away b/c I loved the title i probably like you didn't know exactly what it was about which is good because it makes the film more enjoyable the problem is is that it rambles and doesn't end well at all still worth biewing though
5,Very well written highly readable and informative,"This book is essential reading for anyone interested in politics and civil rights generally. For those with a specific interest in the Northern Ireland or American civil rights movements of the 60s, this is one of the best books written on this subject.A very unique book that credibly draws parallels between the concurrent campaigns.Highly recommended."
2,Look nice but the description is a LIE,"They do NOT clear stud girdles as the description states. They look nice but if you are an American Muscle purist like I am, meaning that you'd prefer to have ""Made in USA"" on your aftermarket parts then these are not for you. Shame on Ford for charging ""Made in USA"" prices for Chinese parts. Boooooo"
5,Fast shipping great product,"Item was shipped very quickly. Great product, actually tastes like pasta, great if your a diabetic to get a lower sugar reading. Would highly recommend!"
5,taxgal,This is the best pasta if you follow a low carb diet. It has the flavor and texture you would expect pasta to have.
3,Ehh,"It took much longer then it should have for me to receive my order, and the expiration date was the same month I received it.."
3,Good option,"These are handy if you are trying to low-carb and miss your pasta fix. They aren't exactly like traditional pasta, naturally, but for us they do fill the void."
1,Are You Kiddin me?,"Yo, let's get this straight Foxy has nothing to worry about with Amil ,she is garbage , no matter what the editor says. She can not contend with EVE, Rah Digga, Sonja Blade, Remi Martin, Foxy, Lady Luck,etc. She can not hold her own in this rap game. Just because she is a 10 doesn't make her album a 10. Her is Beautiful but this album is garbage, not worth dubbin. 1 good song,""4 da fam"". No stars, weak album. You other reviewer don't kidd me again. Peace one."
1,amil pack it in,"we waited 2 years for this, amil, sole, and queen pen need to pack it in, they only got by because of their looks and by giving the producers, and ceo's sexual favors.amil was tight on can i, and 12 o clock but on her on she can't rap. this proves not all rappers should go mainstream."
3,aight ....but shows promise,"When I bought this album i expected it to be a strong joint from one of those who contributed to Jigga's ""Can I Get A"" cut. I was dissapointed though, lack of guest appearances with the exception of Beyonce of course and the flat beats. ""I Got That"" is definitely a bangin joint but the rest was okay. A good start for a promising rapper nonetheless...."
3,Warner Bros. In A Big Rush,"Boy, Warner Bros. sure is in a big rush to get all seasons of ""Friends"" out on DVD. Why can't they release ""Cheers"" and ""Frasier"" that fast? I don't know. I like ""Friends"", it's a good show, and I thought the 8th season was pretty good. Some people think it was the best season, mostly because of Rachel's pregnancy."
4,In better shape then other used places,I buy used dvds all the time and the ones i get here are always in very good condition and a lot cheaper even with shipping than the ones i have bought from half price books.
5,An Amazing Show That Only Gets Better With Age,"I have been an avid Friends fan since the 1994 appearance of Rachel running into the coffee house in a rain streaked wedding dress. Who knew how much the writers could progress from there. Season 8 delivers more surprise with Rachel's pregnancy as well as the surprise father. I liked this show more in the later seasons because it was a lot more like me. I was 11 in 1994 so I didn't understand the crude humor as much as I do now. I loved Seinfeld for the show about nothing, but I love Friends for the everlasting love and affection, and an unforgettable show that will warm my heart for so many years after it's gone. This is a must buy, just as every season is. If you haven't seen Friends yet, you must start from the beginning to understand the romance saga, but trust me, its worth it!"
2,Very bad spanish titles,"Ok, this is the best season ever. So, I've decided to share with spanish speakers friends, and I realized that the titles are really bad, and all the funny stuff has become bored.I think they should put some time, making good titles so more people around the world could get a bit of the fun of FRIENDS."
5,that's a good,not only the product quality is very good but i cant forget the low price of the item. I would buy again from this seller and i suggest every body to trust him.theo
4,"""What, what did her a#& explode!""","Friends - The Complete Eighth Season is the not the best season like everyone proclaims (season 4 is the best!) but this show really is a gem. Some big changes in season 8, Monica and Chandler are married and Rachel is pregnant! But who's the father of her baby? It's Ross of course and halfway through the season lovable but fickle Joey starts to have feelings for Rachel. I don't think that was a good idea for the show, Joey and Rachel have no chemistry whatsoever. Jennifer Aniston won an Emmy for this season, she deserved it! Good season but not a standout."
3,Picture is deceiving,"From the picture, this looks like the box set that is cardboard and unfolds, but this is a hard plastic casing with a bunch of discs inside. I was looking for the cardboard version as I have all the other season with that style. Just me being nit-picky but it's still something worth noting!"
3,False advertising?,"I'm a big Friends fan and I'm collecting the 10 seasons. I bought this one thinking that it was going to be the carton box one (I want to have them all in that version of the DVD), because that's the one showing in the image and the description doesn't say the opposite. When I got the DVD, it was the repackage DVD version (a plastic DVD box without more to see, but the four DVDs all stretched together). I was very disappointing with that and if I'd known it was going to be that way, I'd definitely not bought it. I recommend that you be careful with that kind of stuff."
4,This book is a riot! Don't miss it!,"I spent a lot of time laughing out loud while reading this book. Lola is a wonderful character, all spunk and sass and WAY overdramatic, which makes her observations on life lots of fun to read. Dare I admit I see a bit of the teenage me in Lola the Drama Queen? The reason this book only got four stars is because it ended rather abruptly--and far, far too soon! I really hope the author writes another book about these great characters (although at this point, i'm not sure what they could do that wouldn't be anti-climactic.)"
2,Not Exactly Fantstic...,"When Mary Elizabeth Cep, who insists upon being called Lola, is forced to moveto Dellwood ""Deadwood,"" New Jersey, the teen is forced to take matters into her own hands. This book would be good, but it is clouded with ""Lola's"" snottiness and self obsession. She constantly complains about how unimaginative her close relatives and friends are. She considers herself a ceative genius, which is a constant annoyance. All in all, don't spend your money. If you can, just borrow it."
3,Teenage Life,"This book is about a teenager who is dealing with hard things teenagers go through. I did like this book because this girl was confident in what she did and she handled things great. Yes, I recommend other people to read this book because it shows the difficulties teenagers go through and it enlightens you in a way where you understand har life. The dialogue was believable because that's the way teenagers are today. My favorite character was Mary because she was confident, bright, and cheerful. I did not like Carla because she was rude to people who were not popular. The author wrote in a way that I could picture what was happening."
4,The queen of Drama,"When I first started reading this book I was like ' How dull some freaky girl who is basically a as the title says Drama queen.' But as i got into the book I realised that Lola ( as she prefers to be called, is a lot more than that. Like any teenage girl of course. This story tell sabout a spontanious girl who isn't afraid to show how crazy she truly is."
3,The Teen Queen Disappoints,"Although the basic message of this book is touching- (be yourself, stand out, don't be afraid to do what you want to do) -the writing style is lacking. The story is developed and has good, strong characters but is cliché and predictable. Not a book I would buy, but a book I would perhaps borrow had I not read it already."
2,Reads like a teen movie,"I bought this book because of its title, something I never do, I almost always read reviews first. I hope you will. Most here are very positive, mine is not. I haven't been a teenage drama queen in many, many years but I am a Mrs. Baggoli (her drama teacher.) Lola is a grating, unsympathetic heroine: she's at least as self-absorbed as her rival Carla Santini. She's also too smart by half for a 16 year old. I'm sure it'll be a popular movie-- I won't see it, though."
5,Perfect book for 12-16 year-olds! A great Christmas gift!,"I started Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen yesterday and stayed up half the night finishing it! Sure I regretted it that morning when I had to wake up at 6 to go to high school but it was definatly worth it!Who would be able to put down the fabulously realistic and humorous Lola and her best friend Ella? I can't wait to get my hands on My Perfect Life, the sequel, and read on.For all potenial buyers, this is a great gift for 12-16 year-olds and a really fun book."
4,fun and flashy,"Mary Elizabeth Cep has known practically since birth that her name is far too ordinary for a girl of her nature. This is why she has renamed herself Lola Elspeth Cep (or Sep, she hasn't decided yet). However, her friends and family in The City, who have known her her whole life, fail to comply.So, when her mother announces that they are moving to Dellwood (aka Deadwood), New Jersey, Lola (after finally resigning herself to the news) sees it as a chance to reinvent herself, and the likes of Carla Santini, the most popular girl in school, can't stop her. Along the path of her reinvention she befriends Ella, her polar opposite on the wildness scale, and shows her that a little adventure now and then is perfectly acceptable. A classic new-girl tale is pumped up with drama and makes for an entertaining read."
3,"Loved some, hated some.","This book contains four novellas by four well known authors. The four heroines are shopaholics. Each lady has her own set of problems. The interesting twist is that all four ladies in the book know each other. Therefore, you see cameos of the ladies in stories other than their own.*** Personally, I thought the first and last stories were the best. My favorite author, however, is one of the other two. I was a bit disappointed by that, but I now have two new names to add to my ""Check This Girl Out"" list. The authors did not make their heroines perfect either. Not many women today look anorexic. It is about time some curvy ladies get their stories told! Well worth your time and money to pick up this book. ***"
3,Again I hate romances!!!,"This book was okay for the style of storytelling, but I can not stand romances.ShamelessA love at first sight story step-by-step. Ending with a night of lovemaking and in the morning a marriage proposal. TALK ABOUT FICKTION!!!!Please Baby PleaseWhat I didn't like about this story is it made reference to a size 14 as being obese. Lost me right there....2df.The other two stories were mediorcre. Like I said before if you are into romances try or eyes at this one.Later!!!!"
5,A top-notch anthology,"Not the same ol' same ol'. Here's an anthology with a nice twist and each story has its own unique flava. Funny, touching and with just enough sprinkled in to make you think. I breezed through this book in one day. Quick, fun read."
4,It shipped fast and was sealed,The package came faster then I thought especially right before christmas. Also it came sealed which was great.
2,not advertised size,"The chair was much smaller than the dimensions listed on the site. It should not be listed as a ""teen"" chair since my 125lb. 14 year old could not fit in the chair. The chair was returned to Homevisions and the cost and shipping were gladly refunded."
2,Non-Quantitiative & of Limited Value,"For individuals actually interested in quantitative measurements of intellectual property value, this book is largely a waste of time. The text is full of a lot of business school ""value creation"" idealism and has little practical value in my opinion. Indeed, for those really interested in valuing intellectual property and intangible assets, see the associated book by Gordon V. Smith and Russell L. Parr. This text has everything you are looking for and this book is unnecessary."
2,Good quick Introduction,"This book has its good points and its bad points. The good thing is that it is very well written, concise and easy to read. It brings important points to light and is a good start at dealing with a large complex issue. The bad aspect is that the book tends to rely on the experience of the author in developing the models that are at the heart of the book, rather on validated and tested truths.A good place to start...."
2,Intellectual Capital,"I found Dr. Sullivan's work to be an immodest dialogue of his (mostly) theoretical work that provides a somewhat weak framework for identifying and leveraging intellectual capital (IC). It provides a tangled treatment of IC yielding simplistic impracticable formulae and high-level stratification of IC concepts with very little applicable process. I'm afraid it falls short of its stated objective to offer an approach for extracting value from intellectual capital, and is not nearly as informative nor engaging as related works such as those by Thomas Stewart or Karl Erik Sveiby.-- Doug Laney, Senior Program Director, META Group"
5,An absolute delight,"Incredible, subtle, mesmerizing, rewarding, creative, addictive, relentless, matchless, soulful, powerful. And more.Meyer has redefined the Bach Cello Suites in ways heretofore unimaginable. The deep notes of his double bass can give you goose bumps at times. The phrasings are superb, and his mastery of techniques is truly awe inspiring. Bach himself would have been pleased!The only complaint I have is that this CD contains only three of the six suites. Here's to hoping that Meyer will do the rest of them in the future!"
5,A bold and soulful recording,"I originally purchased this CD because I like to listen to different interpretations and treatments of Bach's music. But nothing prepared me for the deep resonance and beautiful tone that Meyer imparts to his performance. The gigues and bourrees are performed in as spirited manner as you would expect from the great Bach interpreters. There are also touches reminiscent of Yo-Yo Ma in the high tessitura parts were Meyer pulls a lot of emotion out of the instrument. If you want only one set of Cello Suites, get Casals's, Yo-Yo Ma's, or Rostopovich's, but if you enjoy a different view of Bach (but one faithful in it's interpretation) then you will fall in love with this CD."
2,Pedestrian,"I have many recordings of these suites and I don't like this one. The recording does not capture the drama and pathos of the suites - they are played matter-of-fact. Recording engineer Todd Whitelock's sound is dead and artificial. The cello has no sense of localization in space. I assume Mr. Whitelock chose to place it predominantly on the left channel to compensate for that. There are literally hundreds of recordings of these suites on cello, but not on the double bass. There is a reason they are not played on the double bass - it doesn't sound as rich and nuanced as on cello."
4,Nice Hits Package,"More James Brown than most casual fans need, but the price is right for the extra cuts. Look up funk in the dictionary -- it says James Brown!"
5,Great collection,"Included all the greatest, or at least well know hits. Probably missing a few that I'm sure the die hard fans will point out what it's missing so I'll just add that's it's more than complete for everyone else."
4,I feel good!,"What can I say? James Brown is the man! I may not love him in real life, but he is a welcome addition to my music collection."
4,"And You Can Dance To It, Too","Have been annoying co-workers by playing this album - softly, honest - and dancing around the office to James Brown. Utterly enjoyable and for baby-boomers, fun nostalgia."
3,"Where is ""Living in America""???????","Great album. Really gets you dancing. Big problem though, one of my favorites is ""Living in America"" which is not on this album!!!!!"
5,Haaaiiiiii!!!!,"Sometimes I feel so nice, Good God, I jump back- I gotta kiss myself!Especially when I listen to this stuff. A couple of relative clunkers (I could do without ""Man's World"", myself) but overall a collection of masterworks by the one and only.There's gotta be room on your shelf for at least one CD of James Brown, and this is as good a compilation as any."
5,The Hardest Working Man In Show Business.,"I don't think I really need to tout this cd all that much as James Brown's music speaks for itself. I'd just like to reiterate that for a one disc retrospective of this man's music this cd is exceptionally good. 20 tracks covering all his most well known songs and some not so well known. Of course, if you have more money I'd recommend that box set or buying his individual cds, but for those just wanting a pit stop, this cd is what you want. This is a must have for any rock collector."
4,"Unbelievable singer, entertainer; he will be missed :-(","Isn't it funny how singers become even more popular once they've died. James Brown was already a legend in life and he's as much of a legend in death. I've always loved his music and he set a presidence for acts to follow all the way down the track.I really love this cd, because it truly has some of his best best work. I especially love Make It Funky Pt 1, Try Me and my all time favourite Get Up Offa That Thing. This is a cd that you can really enjoy because the music is contagious and you can't help dancing.What an amazing talent James was and I'm sure he'll be missed by all his fans. If you aren't a fan already, take a listen to the long list of hits on this cd and you might become a fan yourself. I love this."
1,JUNK,I was looking for a compact decent sounding stereo for my kitchen and bought this thinking it would be great to install on the wall. After about a month it sporadically stopped reading the cd's and now after 6 months you can't get thru more than 60 seconds of a cd before it stops. This morning I tossed it in the trash where it belongs.
1,Not recommended...,"This thing is horrible. My parents bought me this for my room. At first I was excited but eventually became diassapointed.PROS:*Nice blue blacklight*Good sound quality*Cheap*Two speakers includedCONS:*Bass Boost is HORRIBLE. If you want some good bass don't get this product*Doesn't have any presets*Doesn't show what time it is*Bad manual*Sometimes doesn't read my CD's*Control is useless: Only has CD player functions*If you're listening while on your bed, you're going to have to get up and switch modes to CD or FM radio because you can't with the remoteAlso I've had it for about 3 months and now the blacklight doesn't work anymore..."
1,Dont be fooled,"This product looked cool, but it is just cheap made too fool customers with its smooth looks and great reduced price. They sound is horrendous, with a loud undercurrent of statick. Dont be fooled by the price and cool exterior."
1,Both the Radio & Customer Service are HORRIBLE,I purchased this product less than 4 months ago. Already the CD Player does not work. When I bought this product I was told by Amazon that the manufacturer had a year warranty. However when I called Coby they told me that after 3 months you have to pay almost the same amount to have your old one fixed as it would cost to purchase a new one.Dont waste your time or your money.
3,Good for the price,The good:-Desing-Great Sound-CheapThe Bad:-The radio stations don't change with the remote-The plastic structure it's soft but bad quality. The buttons are too bad in comparison at the product style.-Elevated temprature in the down side when the cd plays----------------------Spanish--------------------------Lo bueno:-Diseño moderno-Muy buen sonido-BaratoLo malo:-No se pueden sintonizar radios con el control remoto.-La estructura plástica del equipo es de agradable diseño pero la calidad del plástico utilizado es mala. Algunos botones del equipo parecen no ir de acuerdo con la modernidad del mismo ya que son duros y cuando se accionan dan la sensación de fragilidad-Mi unidad en particular calienta mucho.IMPORTANTE: EL EQUIPO FUNCIONA TANTO EN 220 y 110 VOLTS. SOLO DEBEN MOVER EL BOTON SELECCIONADOR DE CORRIENTE EN LA PARTE INFERIOR DEL EQUIPO. SALUDOS PARA TODA LA GENTE DE HABLA HISPANA
4,Great product,"I bought 2 of these, one for each of my grandaughters. They both love them. The system is very sleek and up to date. The top loading feature is great and the remote control is a plus ."
4,Coby micro magic,"The price of this stero system doesn't do the quality justice. Could use more bass, but other than that, I can't say enough good about the system. Easy to set up....can hang on the wall, if you want. A real space saver with good sound.... Great value for a room. Buy with confidence"
2,One word.........TERRIBLE,"I bought my stereo at the Army and Air Force Exchange Service(AAFES) Store and after two months, the right speaker broke. I bought it because of the design and value. It cost 40.00 without tax. I will buy a better 100.00 Sony stereo as a replacement."
4,Very good Sound.,I found the product to be very great because of its' compact size. And it still has a great sound.
2,You get what you pay for,This is a pretty cheap system and when it arrived you can see why. Upon opening it you can hear things clinking around inside of it. It was also so light that it almost seemed fake. If you want to just play a CD or listen to the radio then it will do the job. But if you want quality sound and function then you should invest in a better more expensive one. This was for my parents who are not very technological anyway.
3,Not bad...,"I bought this stereo because I liked its simple and modern design. It's not the highest quality, but it serves the basic purposes of playing CDs and listening to the radio. For the price I paid (about $30), I'm not disappointed."
4,Learning for Teachers and Students,"I have used this book and its strategies for the high school history classes I teach. I have found it useful when teaching students how to take different kinds of tests: multiple choice, essay,short answer, etc. I have found using it with high school students helps them when they become college students. By preparing for tests in a proper way, text anxiety is minimized. I recommend this book for my students and their parents. It is written in an easy simple to follow format."
3,"Great TV show, but fair picture quality.","If you remember this TV show from years gone by, then you'll love to watch this again as I did. The only drawback, and its a big one for me, is that it looks like it was transferred from a cheap VHS copy with no enhancements made. So if you can put up with fair video quality, you'll enjoy this. PS. If you think that this stuff is too old and in poor quality to start with , take a look at what they did with the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies of the 40's(they recently issued the complete set; black cover with silver writing). The picture quality is amazing for its age. If one wants to expend the effort and time, wonders can be done. Its obvious that NW Passage was done cheap & dirty. Sorry to disappoint."
5,DOT recently purchased,"I have bought several of these volumes over the years and simply wore them out by looking up job titles in my work as a vocational rehabilitation counselor. This volume is in ""like new"" condition. It sits on the bookshelf in my office awaiting demise of the one that I still use. That one began life looking as good as the one recently purchased. Very happy with the service from Amazon and will purchase items from company again."
4,Good reference,Good reference if you know enough about Maya to spot the discrepancies. Some of the tutorials are also buggy in Maya 8.
4,good book,great explanations!!! used it for a world religions class... just great to read and easy to understand!!
3,ENCYCLOPEDIA READING,"IF YOU ENJOY READING THE ENCYCLOPEDIA, YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO SIGN A LEGAL DOCUMENT AND ATTEMPTED TO READ IT BEFORE SIGNING IT. EVEN THOUGH YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORDS, THE WAY THEY ARE PUT TOGETHER MAKES THEM MEANINGLESS. IT'S LIKE THEY ARE PURPOSELY TRYING TO CONFUSE YOU. THAT IS HOW I FELT ABOUT THIS BOOK. THE CONTENTS SEEMED TO BE VERY INTERESTING BUT THE WRITING FELT LIKE SOMETHING ALEX TREBECK WOULD DO."
4,Basic introdction to the world religions,"The book is a good basic introduction to the world relgions covered. Its dealing with the fundamental beliefs and practices of the faiths covered is clear, concise, well organized, and well thought out. One draw back for the person looking for more detail is that it isn't there. But this is not an effort to be comprehensive. It can serve to open your eyes and your mind to the positives of each faith and launch you on the road to furthud study. The pictures are nice. They do give a feel for the lifestyles of those who live the faiths. But there is no real tie in to the text as interesting as they are. I would recommend this book as a beginning reader to comparative religious thought and a basic introduction to the religions of the world."
5,Succinct and respectful,"Most books on world religions use Christianity as the ""baseline"" structure, comparing each religion to Christianity's structure. Huston Smith doesn't do that--he lets each religion have its own structure and answer its own questions. Reflecting on the best that each religion has to offer, the illustrated version forces Smith to be even more succinct and clear. A treasure."
2,Important omission,"This has a nice treatment of faith concepts, and would be an excellent resource for people contemplating various religions... but I marvel that it hardly mentions the most recent, fastest growing, most widespread (next to Christianity) independent world religion: the Baha'i Faith. This is odd, especially given that the Baha'i's acknowledge the unity of God, of all religions, and of humanity, and especially given that the founder of the Faith has over 100 volumes of scripture available for study. I think it warrants more attention in any book that proposes to compare religions; and the omission is an unfortunate one."
5,A Beautiful Book!,"This is an excellent overview of the world's major religions, well researched and clearly written so that even a novice can understand. Lush photographs, color and black & white, appear on almost every page, illustrating interesting and unique specifics of each religion - i.e., gods, body decorations, services, icons, etc. Very satisfied with this purchase!"
3,random illustrations,While this book has many many illustrations they are not tied in to the text in any meaningful way. It's as if they are just there for the sake of being there...
5,Great,Just what I expected. It arrived on time. It's a great easy to read text book and was cost effective.
3,"very light read, no real help with scoring or rules","before the book i was able to get the players marked properly onto base. this author talks about the joy of scoring, the diversity, some ways different scorers make marks, but does not discuss the messy parts like how to mark complex plays involving fielders choice with complexities and make it understandable for later.further, the resolution of some of the images is not very good in the Kindle App including on my iPad and Apple Air. i have to make the fonts really big to see the image, which still are not that good, and then the letters/words are so big they are not on the same page as the diagram."
3,a nice bit of ephemera,"I agree with the reviews already written. This is a nice book and reasonably priced, but not fully satisfying. It is an outline for an outstanding book, but it is not itself outstanding. Use it as a mid-winter meditation on the game or lend it to friends who don't understand why you bring pencil and paper to the ballpark."
3,"The history is well-researched, but a few errors appear.","An excellent source for those interested in the history of scoring and famous incidents involving scorers. Unfortunately, several errors relating to the scoring rules appear. Intended more for those who already know how to score than those who are trying to learn."
3,Nice book for those who already know how to score,"I bought this book for help me keeping score, but really I don't feel I learned all that much. The best thing about the book is that it goes into the history of keeping score. Overall I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,"well it's not great soderburgh - but better than i, at first, thought",it took a while (almost left it unresolved). the last half-hour was quite bloody (not something i like) but saw it to the end.it was okay.
3,Not as good as the others in the series,I love the Achaeological Mysteries but I finally just gave up on this one towards the end. It is too convoluted and I found myself not caring about the resolution of the story.
4,Poor package design,"You'll find that the outer of the two DVD's will come loose in shipping many times. As both discs rest on the same spindle, the outer one will often come loose and bounce around in the packaging as it's shipped resulting in a scratched DVD.I just hope this one doesn't promise extras on the package that aren't actually on the DVD."
4,Modern modal hard bop blowin' date!,"A great, great album. They are really cookin' here. A modal hard bop blowin date, with a remarkable ""new"" pianist, Jeff Babko. All the other musicians excell too, obviously.A cd that I can't stay too much far from.This album smokes! Buy it, don't hesitate."
3,Not the best... but still fun,"The music quality is ok. Better than I was expecting; however, it does sound like a MIDI file in some places.My biggest criticism is that when the song breaks into parts, it only puts one part on the screen. For example, in ""Funny Honey"" at the end, it only has Amos' spoken part on the screen. Roxie's part is written in the booklet, but it would be better if that had both parts on the screen simultaneously. Also, on ""We both reached for the Gun"" the voices of the reporters are recorded, and I would have rather they weren't. And thirdly, the MC introductions aren't there on any song!But other than these three things it is fun to get to sing along with a great musical."
1,HORRIBLE BEYOND WORDS!,Do NOT BUY THIS CD! The singers are off-tune and lousy and sing with no feeling. The music in the backround dull and boring and sounds nothing like the actual soundtrack. Some wrong notes are hit and the rhythm is difficult to follow. THE MINUTE I LISTENED TO IT I THOUGHT IT WAS HORRIBLE AND WONDERED WHY THESE PEOPLE WERE HIRED TO MAKE THIS CD!!! Do not waste your money and time in buying this CD. I know I already did.
1,My Highschool Orchestra Sounds Better then this One,"This recording is HORRENDOUS!!!!!!! Not only are the ensemble singers one person who cant stay in tune half the time but the insturmentation is horrendous. About 20 peent of the time it sounds like they screwed up and never fixed it. I listened to it on my way home from NYC for the first time and I had to shut it off it was so horrible. EVEN IF YOU LOVE CHICAGO, THIS CD WILL RUIN IT"
4,Do you have a moment for a little Chit-chat?,"This is a great overlooked movie, for the sake of movie. Cinematographie, scenes, locations, all beautiful.Stallone and Bandaras are a hoot. There scenes together were great, their scenes seperate...o.k. Julianne Moore is great. She is the person in this movie that really helps sell it.It's a good movie for passing the time. Rent it, buy it, or just sit at home and pray no one has put a hit out on you. Cause either one of these guys would happily finish you if paid enough. Sorry, I should't talk that way to a lady. My bad."
4,Not Bad!,"How can you say too much bad about a Stallone and Banderas film with lots of action and guns. It could be a little tighter, and it could have a little less space between the scenes, but everybody looks so good and there are lots of guns. If you only like sappy love stories with no action and no guns, don't buy this film."
4,Great action,I really enjoyed this movie. I like the pairing of Stallone and Banderas.They make for an action filled time.
4,An Enjoyable Movie,My wife and I enjoyed this movie. I thought the pace was good and it kept me interested. A good movie.
3,Standard Stallone Movie !,"This movie is good, but nothing else ! It's ""Stallone"" All the way, but Antonio Banderas give the movie a lift ! The movie has Intensive action scenes. The picture & Sound is not the best iv'e seen, but Good enough !Rent it !"
5,"Great movie, great actors","I love this movie, but I admit I'm a little turned off by the Stallone action genre. I'm glad I did watch it. I love Electra, she's the best. A woman can be a strong character, she doesn't do what he tells her, until she trusts him. The scene in which Stallone spills his guts about liking her is even more compelling because she's not around to hear it. Great job by Antonio, he's just beautiful enough to be scary. Great movie!!"
4,Assassins,"Robert Rath is a professional hit man who, despite his stature as the best in the business, has grown disillusioned about his work and his life. But as he contemplates a way out of the shadowy world he inhabits, Rath is shocked to discover that he himself is the target of assassination. A ruthless, ambitious young killer named Miguel Bain wants to become the number one assassin and knows he must remove Rath to do so. The two men's lives and careers intersect when both of them are sent to eliminate Electra, a beautiful ""information assassin""--an electronic surveillance expert who possesses valuable secrets on a computer disk. Rath and Electra team up to make a break for freedom--but they have to get past Bain first. This movie is very interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Antonio And Sylvester do a very good job of acting opposite of each other throughout the movie."
1,Hollywood anti-gun rights rant.,"This was a horrible movie. It was predicable and way too long. In addition, it was ironic that Hollywood would put so many anti-gun rights messages into a movie that glorifies gun-violence.Hollywood would you at least please teach actors how to hold and fire a handgun--seeing these guys handle the weapons in the movie is laughable. If I see another actor firing a gun while holding it sideways I think I'll scream!"
2,Wasted talents...,"Face the truth: this movie jus didn't take off at all. The plot idea was good, but the stupidity of the scenes are disgusting."
1,Poor picture quality,"Poor picture quality, every other second the picture either goes blurry or seems to glitch and show lines. Quite obvious on a computer monitor, less so on a tv. Annoying. Decent flick, though not half as dark as it tries to be, and burdened with typical Hollywood elements that detract from an otherwise viable main story. It does have its moments, primarily thanks to Banderas (IMHO), but is still doomed to cliche and mediocrity for its ""action movie"" formula. End result: where this movie could have been much darker, it is merely campy (like a typical action movie). Could have very easily become the thriller it should have been, if it had been given a director with some vision. It's clear that Donner really didn't know where he wanted to go (except to the bank) with this movie. LONG STORY SHORT: decent flick, bad dvd."
3,"a ""follow up"" on flatland",Just as in the book flatland (by Adwin A. Abbott) this takes a new perspective on the dimension we live in. Read it if you liked flatland.
2,poor character development,"I just finished reading Spaceland and I'm a more than a little disappointed. The relationships that exist between characters is so dysfunctional that it's almost completely unrealistic. It's like the breakfast club of emotional misfits: co-dependent, hopelessly insecure, delusional, borderline personality, morally vacuous -- it's a mess that Rucker tries to pass off as normal human interaction when it's anything but. This was such a frustrating distraction that it ruined what would have been an otherwise decent story."
5,Massive enjoyment,"This book is sort of a satire of Edwin Abbot's ""Flatland."" Poor Joe Cube, he is constantly getting into trouble. Joe Cube, Spazz and the mobsters are some of the more enjoyable characters in this book. The technology theme plays a large part in this book. Joe is given a ""Third Eye,"" by a creature from the fourth dimension called Momo. He is able to see through walls, and ladies clothing. Lots of fun."
5,What a Wild Ride!!!,"I read this book and loved every minute of it. Rudy Rucker combines intelligence, humor, and perfect storytelling into one of the best modern sci-fi comedies I've read. Not to mention, this book takes an abstract theoretical concept like 4-D life, and makes it seem completely real.I wish there were more books like this. I'd recommend it to anyone...it's one of my favorites. And if you're looking for another good book to read after Spaceland, check outNational Darkroast Day."
5,A Forgotten Treasure,"I was a teen when this ablum was first released. At the time, 'Give Blood' was the hit single and the sole reason I bought 'White City'. This ended up being one of those vinyl albums that I played the hell out of. It's truly epic.... meant to be listened to in order. I never upgraded to cassette or CD, I just forgot about it. Until now. It's really such a treat to listen to this all over again. If you are a fan of Pete's, Pink Floyd (Dave Gilmour) or the Who (Tommy), I think you will love this album. My favorite song on this is 'Hiding Out', so I appreciated the bonus track."
3,Not His Best Work,"I remember waiting....and waiting for something new to be released of Townshend's after his masterpiece ""Empty Glass"". Because there were so many years, and such longing for more, this album was a bit of a disappointment. I dug it out today (2001) for another listen. Although it is musically interesting, it does not approach the perfection Pete achieved on earlier works such as ""Rough Mix"", ""Empty Glass"", or ""Who Came First"". But the piece is very interesting and has a few gems ""I am secure"", and ""Give Blood"" come to mind. Give it a listen, and make up your own mind!"
4,Underrated album,The Who's guitarist steps out an innovative album which doesn't showcase much guitar but focuses on a very un-Who like sound. Well worth picking up.
5,White City: A Novel,"This in my opinion is Pete Townsend's best CD all around.There really is not a bad track on it. There are'nt that many CD's you can just pop in and listen all the way through, but this is one of them. I highly recommend it."
4,Pete's Townshend's best,"White City is my favorite Pete Townshend ""solo"" album. Although Empty Glass is a very close second, White City beats it by a nose and is notably better than Chinese Eyes, Who Came First, Iron Man, or Psychodirelect. The album has awesome standout tracks, and the ""second tier"" songs are also excellent. Not a bad song on the entire CD. If you are a Pete Townshend fan White Ciry is a must-have release. Standouts: Give Blood, Face the Face, Crashing by Design, White City Fighting."
2,No good.,It somewhat fit the Celica I got it for but no place for the cup holders so I still have a open hole and it does not look good.
4,"AVOID SLIPPAGE -KNOW YOUR CAR""S ABS",I think this book is written by an author who has got in depthh theoritical as well as practical knowledge of vehicle Anti Lock Braking System. The contents are designed and explain in such a way that reader of very little knowledge can easily under stand the whole phenomenon of ABS.I recommend this book as an inevitable guide to be kept in every Auto repair workshop/Garages.One thing i must mention that in the next edition of the book the author should emphasis on the fault diagnosis and remedy of the ABS.
3,a gould sampling,"this collection is a sampling of glenn gould's bach recordings, relying heavily on his 1955 edition of the goldberg variations and keeping in total the art of the fugue which gould recorded on organ. i would recommend the complete editions of each recording sampled here, but for an introduction to mr. gould and for a nice selection of bach piano, this album suffices."
2,"A nice, but totally non-essential, summary of his '80s work","If you have his essential recordings from the '50s, '60s, and '70s, and still find yourself craving more-- you could do a lot worse than to pick up this rather brief set. The only bonafide ""hit"" is, of course, ""Living in America."" But before you scoff at the idea of a ""best of"" set of JB in the '80s, ask yourself how many artists have enough material to fill more than one ""greatest hits"" package. JB has earned his right to be a little self-indulgent."
1,Slow draining and messy,"I have used these on two of my Ford trucks. They are more of a hassle than they are worth. Oil is painfully slow to drain and messy at best. When I am changing my own oil, I don't like to wait all day for it to finish draining. Instead, I went with a spring loaded drain plug that you push up and turn a quarter turn, unlike the Fram drain with the hose, I do not need to remove and keep track of a brass dust cover. Beware with any of these quick drains, the big box stores may not change your oil because of it being a non-oem drain plug."
5,An excellent primer for graduate study,"This is a wonderfully rewarding book on several levels. I enjoyed learning how modern geological concepts emerged from new and revisited data. It's entertaining to witness diverse personalities as the 17 researchers retell their own role in history. Perhaps most of all, it's great to see how the gifted and very shrewd young geologists made the most of their graduate and postdoc opportunities. The result is an entertaining and illuminating illustration of science moving forward and young scientists getting ahead."
5,A Wonderful Recap of the American Solider Role in WWII,"One of my favorite books about the men and events of World War II. Expertly researched it has a great balance in present the large scale geo-political aspects of the war as well and some of the personal effets of the war. Thanks Rick, looking forward to finishing the series with the thrid books next year."
3,An Army At Dawn - Holt paperback edition,"The Holt paperback edition being printed on flimsy newsprint formed for me a disappointment. In this edition no information is given to whether its low grade paper is acid-free, or not, but I suspect that the paper is not acid-free; and the inexpensive paper also renders low quality reproduction of the book's photographic images. I would therefore recommend to those who wish to have this superb book long grace their library that they should spend a few more dollars to purchase the hardcover edition.I wished to refrain from rating this edition by means of Amazon's star rating option as Mr. Atkinson's text is superlative but the Holt paperback edition's paper quality leave a great deal to be desired, but Amazon's review publishing steps forced me to rate it, so I settled on a rating of three stars, purely for the poor quality of the Holt paperback edition's substrate."
3,A plodding tale of military ineptitude,"While historically accurate, the author is a bit too much in love with his prose, a result of which is that the narrative gets bogged down at times. Here and there are what are probably thought of as clever -- if not always subtle -- literary allusions, including to Robert Frost's The Road Not Taken. These serve more to distract than to jazz up. In the end, instead of looking forward to the second book in the trilogy, I find myself disinclined to plod through the rest of the war in Europe -- especially since I already know who wins."
5,Exceptional,"A fantastic account of a little documented phase in America's entrance into WWII. The uninitiated will be astounded at the growing pains of the American and British forces.From the blundering incompetence to the ultimately brilliant finish - and the incredible cost in human life between the two; on a scale hard to fathom in modern perspective.This is a master work, and thankfully will be followed by two more volumes."
5,An Army at Dawn,This is an excellent historical account of the early days of our entry into WW2. Facts that I never knew (and I was a young person at the time) are discussed and analyzed.
4,"Rich, Engrossing",This is a great work of history. It covers the beginning of the war for liberation in Europe in a readable and complete way. I knew very little about the Allies' campaign in North Africa and finished this feeling well-educated.
2,"Text is 5 stars; on Kindle, though, maps are illegible","The text/body of this book is just as amazing as all the other reviewers are saying. Unfortunately, in the Kindle edition the maps are a fuzzy, unreadable mess. I recommend this book highly, just be sure to get the paper edition."
3,Not so great,"My fault with this book is not the over indulgence in detail, but the lack of serious criticism of US. Some reviewers think Atkinson went too far, I don't think he went far enough. Clark killed more Americans than did the Germans yet Atkinson doesn't discuss his disastrous role in the Italian fiasco and relate that back to Africa.He doesn't discus how the British demanded Ike fire him ( as did the Texas Nat'l Guard) and Ike refused.He doesn't discuss how Ike's only combat command , ever, prior to or in WW2 was when he attacked defenseless US veterans in the Bonus Army.Ike was a horrible choice. Clark and Adm King were disasters. Roosevelt knew nothing of war and was a terrible war time President.This book doesn't explain any of that.If it wasn't for the Russians we would all be speaking German."
4,"An Army at Dawn: The War in Africa, 1942-1943, Volume One",The author wrote a very informative and interesting book about a very dark time in our country's history. He provided a good deal of information concerning the difficulties that the Allies faced and also spent a good deal of the book on the discussions with the French before the invasion. The book is well written and fast paced. The individuals portrayed in the book are very real and come to life in the pages. I'm very much looking forward to this author's second and third parts of his trilogy. If they are as well written as this part I believe he'll have a successful venture regarding history and the Second World War.
3,"Good research, poor writing","This is a very thorough and well researched book. However, it lacks cohesion. I found it to be boring at many stretches. It is hard to keep the overall tactical and strategic picture in mind while reading. A good military history weaves the small unit action together with the big picture and keeps a level of excitement and tension throughout. This was not the case in this story."
4,Easy read -- good book,"An easy-to-read account of the US Army's first year in action agains the Germans. The book doesn't add anything new to the literature on the US in North Africa, but it is well written and certainly provides a good overview of the strategic, operational, and tactical situation on the ground. His focus is on how the US Army arrived as green, but well trained, soldiers with high moral. It follows them through their initial successes, but with indicators of problems to come while fighting the French. Atkinson then proceeds to describe how the Army was severely blooded when it first came up against the Germans, but it quickly learned the profession of war. He points out that these lessons, from the common soldier up to Eisenhower, and these units formed the experienced core that went on to win the war in Europe. He also discusses at length the problems of integrating the militiaries and attitudes of the US and British armies."
5,Great Book,"Fantastic book. One of the best WWII books I have ever read. Mr. Atkinson brings to the forefront, in novel-like fashion, a portion of the war that few people are familiar with and very clearly points out just how closly we came to losing. My only criticism, when reading this book a person needs to keep a dictionary close by. Other than that, book is great. This is a must read for anyone interested in WWII."
4,Forgotten History,"The movie Patton made the public aware of America's first foray into the ETO. The US was not ready to go head to head with the armies in Europe already at war for over 3 years. This book covers the period in which the US Army first took offensive action in Europe. In spite of its size it is very readable and full of first person accounts and the view from the top. One sees the lack of direction and experience that plagued our early war efforts, and how this army would be able to grow into the same one that stormed Normandy. The book covers the British, German, and French view as well, and talks about the inside deals made with the Vichy during Torch."
4,A good perspective,"Rick Atkinson's book is different from Jeff Shaara's version of the North Africa story in that Atkinson's book uses a broader range of characters than Shaara's.But hasving reaad Shaara's first, I find it prepared me well for a story that was a little broader.Candidly, both books paid too much attention to the rotten French leadership in North africa at the time. Their dithering generated much more heat than light. I admit that anyone who reads both books may be a little strange, but with Rommel, Patton and MOntgomery all together on one stage, the play is interesting. I would probably buy whatever book either Atkinson or Shaara come up with next."
3,A little glib,"Rick, I thought your other two books were wonderful. ""Long Gray Line,"" was truly brilliant.This one is a little glib. I understand that you try to show the intial landings near Oran were as if the Keystone Cops were doing the planning. But interspersed in the descriptions of endless bungling, there are descriptions of soldiers getting their legs shot off, being killed etc. It just seemed a little glib.Also, some of the descriptions get into minutia that's not needed. I understand you want to show the soldiers point of view, but some of the vignettes make the text drag. Have a point to the small stories.Still a good book, but make the next two in your trilogy flow a little better and don't be so glib about death and dismemberment."
4,An Army at Dawn,The development of the personalities involved is very well done. The descriptions of the military actions and movements gets a bit ponderous.
5,Don't need it? YET,"If you have a camper or RV why wait until you need one? Seriously - driving under trees in campgrounds it's only a matter of time until you tear off the factory plumbing vent cap. And you won't notice it at the campsite, you usually notice it later, when you're nowhere near a place to buy a replacement at any kind of reasonable price. But one now - store it away - take it with you. Then, look up, on your camper or RV's roof - what's that? The vent cap is missing? Now you've got one in your emergency repair kit."
3,A pretty attractive alternative,This is the easy alternative to replacing the entire vent assembly which is comparatively laborious. Don't expect them to last more than a few years as the plastic disintegrates and you can get some corrosion on the metal components.
3,Thinly spread history of sexuality,"A vague history of sexuality, this book offers a broad scope of sex research without delving into enough specifics to make the reader feel moderately comfortable with the topic. The novel breezes through history, stressing the persecution faced by sex researchers without actually commenting on the actual theories. Too much attention is paid to the dilemmas of modern sex research, which are painfully unarticulated. You do gain a sense of the history, however; so this is a good introductory book, but for a more in depth approach search elsewhere."
3,A little disappointed,"My child loves Blue's Clues and this book was in his age frame, but this selection didn't work well for us. The artwrok and story-line were great. The problem was in the length of the book, I'm not sure that there are many pre-schoolers that would sit still long enough to finish this book. I have attempted to read to several children, most of whom could not finish it. I think once my child matures a little more, it will be a better fit though. There is the great opportunity for parents to take the wonderful artwork and put the story in less verbose terms for there kids. In order to make the book enjoyable for my child, that what was necessary for us."
3,a charming idyll but ....,"This used to be considered a classic, but it has sadly faded with time in the face of the loss of innocence. To those who love calmness and virtue, it has its charms. To those who love excitement and sin, it has nothing to say. The climax, where Virginia allows herself to drown rather than get into a lifeboat in a storm because she is in her underwear and is too modest to let the sailors see her thus, is an absurdity to all but the most fanatical devotees of modesty. And it is precisely this climax and its absurdity that have destroyed this book."
2,not the best,"I bought this cap because the old cap did not seal well or the spring was weak, anyway it let the coolant boil out if the engine got too hot. This cap was an improvement but still had the same issue only to a lesser extend, it boiled out less frequently."
2,Try to find an earlier edition,"The 2nd edition of this book was very good, with actual photographs of flatware handles, and made an excellent reference book. Hallmark illustrations were also very good.Subsequent editions have moved to line drawings of the pattern handles, and do not include the photographs. There are better guides to be had."
3,Whisk broom,It is very handy to have a small whisk broom in your car or around the house. This one is a good start.
4,Bounce Your Head to This...,Reggae music gets you hyped up and ready to dance and that's what this CD does! It also adds a lil' bit of love in the middle...
2,Not Funny,"This is an odd travel book. At the bottom of it, the author doesn't seem to like the Chinese very much. Page after page, she complains about the food, accommodations, the transportation, the people. She brings to mind the outdated attitudes of the colonial British, holding their noses as they looked down upon the natives, confident in their smug superiority. In addition, her sense of humor is rather tiresome, always at another's expense, arch and acerbic. I would expect a bumpy trip if I didn't speak the language, and had done zero advance planning to a country as large and diverse as China. Seems like an opportunistic book, superficial, and wholly at the expense of the Chinese."
4,Solid travel tale,"Evans travels across China by mule, plane, boat, bike, train, and car. She eats things she never realized were in the food category and she meets people living lives she never realized were in the lives-lived category.I liked this book much more than Evans' other book, It's Not About the Tapas.Pet peeve: The subtitle says the book will be ""hilarious"". C'mon. You are just setting yourself up for disappointment if you go into the book expecting hilarious. Amusing, yes. Humorous, yes. But hilarious?"
4,What An Adventure!!!,"As a Chinese, I am not offended by this book at all. I actually appreciate Polly Evans' courage and sense of adventure in seeing China in the way that she did. By choosing to use the transportation the locals used, she got to see what life is actually like. An average tourist on an air-conditioned tour bus would have seen a much different China than what she saw. I loved Polly's honest descriptions. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
1,Horrible book!,"Like another poster, I really wanted to enjoy this book. It wasn't even remotely funny. I found the author to be sarcastic, and very arrogant. She painted a very bad picture of China (its culture and its people). The author is so narrow minded, that I'm afraid to read any more of her work. For someone who is supposed to be funny...I found the book to be offensive.If I could give this book ZERO stars, I would. Don't waste your time reading this piece of trash."
4,Culture Shock,"This is a good, fast, and informative read. Be prepared to be shocked and perhaps a bit disgusted because of the graphic explanations of what is done in public. I've never had a great desire to travel to China. Now that I have read the book, I'm not ever going there. The book is filled with great and very interesting historical information.If you want a really great read by the same author get:It's Not About the Tapas: A Spanish Adventure on Two Wheels"
3,PanasonicKX-TS600W Corded Phone,"The phone has many nice optoins, but the caller I.D. window could have some kind of light to help see the number of the caller. The speaker phone from the other end also sounds a little like a tin can. The pick up Mic could be better. Over all I like the phone."
5,Very GOOD Low Cost Headset Phone for Home Business,"I was looking for a low cost headset phone my my Home Business and this is a very good product. I'm using it with a VOIP service and it works just fine. For the most part, I have always had good luck with Panasonic. In the near future, I'll probably recommend it to the other offices that are looking for very good, low cost phones."
4,Good basic speaker phone.,"This is a no frills phone with speaker and caller ID. It works fine -- no complaints. Not many options and no phone book, but overall, it's a pretty good deal."
1,caller id lcd defective?,"We bought 2 of these for our office and BOTH of them after working fine for a few months now have non-functioning LCD panels, which means the caller-ID feature is useless. Changing the batteries does not help. (We tried this twice, with different batches of batteries.)Apparently we can return the phones and get back refurbished phones after several weeks but since our office can't be without phones, we'll just have to scrap these and get something else. I would not judge this product so harshly if this was just a random defect, but it seems to be a common problem judging by the number of similar complaints. There's no excuse for continuing to sell a faulty product. If you need caller ID you might want to consider another product."
4,Great Phone,This phone would have gotten a 5 star except for the fact that it needs batteries. Lots of good features. Panasonic makes great phones corded or wireless.
2,What a disappointment,"What a bad experience. I received this phone as a gift. The redial and caller id functions did not work. Panasonic told me to mail the phone to them for replacement. I paid $10 to do so; I asked for a reimbursement and got no response. Got a new phone from them. The redial worked for 5 minutes and now does not work. No caller id. I give up. The most basic functions -- calling, volume, receiving calls--work fine."
4,Panasonic does it again!,Glad I looked on line at Panasonic corded phones. There's no longer any selection at the warehouse stores. This model suites my needs perfectly. Single line with speaker phone and just the other features I need. Tone dialing is a little slower than my older model. Great price too.
2,Not Recommended,"I bought two phones for my home after reading reviews and phone product details. No place on the web(including panasonic web site), phone details talk about requiring 3-AA batteries that I found after receiving the phone. New batteries die in less than a month. Replace batteries, same problem. Display is not lighted and hard to read. I would say panasonic should have provided AC adapter or low consumption battery product. I would stay away from this phone if caller id and speaker functions important to you."
1,Horrible design,"The speaker phone and caller ID only work when you have batteries in it. It takes 3 AA batteries and they last a few weeks at the most, and that is with light use. There is no way to plug in an adapter either. The sound with the handset is okay, but the speaker phone is not very good. I do not recommend this phone."
1,Very disappointing battery life - AVOID,The caller ID etc. works only when batteries are installed. Fresh batteries are drained in about a week. I gave up replacing the batteries because it's so wasteful. My opinion of Panasonic really diminished when I discovered how poorly engineered this phone is.Consider this an OK basic phone with NO caller ID or other display functions.
2,dial tone after hangup hurts,"The one serious issue I have with this phone is that when using the headset jack, a few seconds after you hang up, it emits a dial tone burst through the headset. This may actually be loud enough to be painful, depending on your ears, your headset, and the volume settings of the phone and the headset (if it has a volume setting). But regardless of whether it hurts, it is annoying. I am going to try to replace this phone with a Plantronics T10 due to this problem. Obviously I don't know whether this problem is just with my unit or is present in some or all other units. One other reviewer (under a different listing of the same product but in back) has reported a problem that sounds the same."
3,"Message good, but art is distracting.","The message this book is trying to convey is good, but the artwork is so overwhelming. Each page has rainbows and pattern borders. I think for a child it is really hard to focus on the message when the artwork is so busy and distracting."
5,Lifoam Div,"Had loned mine to someone and never got it back. I use it (in small Icechest) when I am going all day to run errands.Found it on Amazon and purchased, I find it the easiest way to shop, I hate going to Malls."
5,Mani's spirit unmatched by anyone but her God-Brother.,"As the illustrator, i'd like to comment that the reader will find in these stories of her childhood, Mani's spirit was unmatched by anyone but her brother, Avatar Meher Baba."
4,Worth While in Every Way,"Produced by Gamble & Huff, Jerry Butler and his band recorded these hits circa 1966-70. 2 discs give you plenty to choose from. If you like The Temptations, Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, or a cat like David Ruffin you'll love Jerry Butler."
5,Better than Sinatra !,"If Jerry had cast another hue he would be the Sinatra of our time. The proofs in the pudding- All you have to do is listen to Jerry's vocal artistry on these and literally every song he's ever recorded- particularly ""Moon River"" and his rendition of ""Alfie"". One of the best pop singers of the 20th century."
5,Looks good so far!,Keep the application light!!! Apply per directions (LIGHT) and buff with micro fiber towel. Great shine and we'll see how long it lasts. Do not get this on black rubber or plastic parts! Good luck getting it off if you do!
5,Steal this disc!,"It's not everyday you hear a CD that is great from the first note to the decay of the last chord, but Metallic I.O.U. is one of them. The songs are well written and performed (guitarist Jimmy James deserves kudos for his lead and slide work on the record)- these guys live what they sing about and offer no apologies for it. ""Downtown,"" ""Bent,"" ""I Luv You,"" ""Broke, Drunk & Stoned"" and a killer cover of the Lords of the New Church's ""Russian Roulette"" stand out. The CD is just cool all the way through."
5,Eddie and the Cruiser CD,Great CD. If you are a fan of the movie Eddie and the Cruisers and you love the soundtrack to the movie then this is one of the CD's you should buy.
1,EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS UNRELEASED TAPES,"I WANT TO KNOW WHY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, TENDER YEARS WAS ON THIS ALBUM AND WHY IT'S NOT THERE NOW. WITHOUT TENDER YEARS, THIS ALBUM ISN'T WORTH .2/ BELIEVE ME, MY COMPANY WON'T EVEN SPONSOR THE DEEID AND THE CRUISERS ALBUMS ANYMORE."
5,Excellent Music And Voice Scenes From Both Movies.,"This Is A Great Album That Has Songs And Voice Scenes From Both Movies That Were Not On The Original Soundtracks. The Only Thing Is There Are Two Versions Of This Album Out There. This One Here And There Is An Out Of Print Version That Has The Scene When Joann Sings ""Tender Years"". The New One (The One Sold Here) Has ""Tender Years"" Replaced With The Song ""SleepWalk"" Either Album Is Great. I Suggest Any ""Eddie And The Cruisers"" Fan make This Album A Part Of Your Collection."
4,"Not really that Lost, and some shouldn't have been found","I hate to write a review like this but after all these years of loving this band, some record producer was trying to make a buck by slapping together movie tracks as a story line with some music which takes away from the songs.This is like the same attempt they made with the 2nd movie. Bad story, different actors, and good music is not a good mix.Get this for the music, put it on your Ipod, and delete all of the movie tracks. Then it's awsome!"
1,Don't last,"These wheels don't last. The rubber came off one after the first day and I couldn't keep it on my son's bike. I kept putting it on, but finally it came off and we couldn't find it. He road on just the platic and it worked better. Of course it was about 4 days until the rubber on the other tire came off and the plastic started to wear down. These are horrible and a waste of time and money............ The cheap cheap plastic ones are much last a lot longer with less issues."
1,Terrible!,"I bought these for my son and they say on the package that they will work on a 20"" bike, the directions show what should be a hole to attach them for a bike that size - problem? The actual product doesn't have the hole that is shown in the directions for a 20"" bike! We put them on anyone thinking that maybe the directions were wrong since the packaging claimed they would work and the wheels just kept bending upwards and the bike tipped over. So now I am looking for new training wheels and my little guy is reluctant to even try again."
5,It is good,Good and quality product. Its flexible construction make it work as shock absorber which is good when riding on not even surface. At the same time it is firm enough to keeps balance of bicycle.I use it for 12'' weals.
1,"an other bad design, it doesn't hold the the weight",my 80 pound daughter feel with these as they spring/coil is to flimsy!!! original idea but not practical and safety hazard for the kids.
4,A calendar you actually remember to use...,"A bright spot of the day (for me, anyway) is when I check to see what writing from Dave is provided. The only ""complaint"" I have about this calendar is that the days don't seem to have any sort of theme to them--the articles seem to be a little random, but that's OK... after all, it is Dave Barry we're talking about here!"
5,Darwinian Obsession!,"Oh GOD, I love this manga, and I'm a picky reader! This manga has seriously Darwinian implications! Who is the fittest, the alien parasytes, or humanity? Shin is a high school kid who is finding out. Shin has a parasyte that matured in his left hand and is dealing with the issues of why parasytes feed on humans, creating a panic in the city over the ""mincemeat murders.""Shin must deal with becoming more and more like the symbiotic alien in his left arm, while the alien picks up more human reactions. There's a lot of violence and blood, not to mention questioning of what is it to be human. Not only that, but there is the parasytes' need to survive in human society, because humans are noticing their presence. They are trying to save themselves and their species. Who's right and who's wrong? And why do they need to eat humans?If you are into these issues, check this out!(BTW: there IS a movie in the making! The Henson Creature Shop is working on it! Whoo hoo!!)"
2,Nan could have afforded better writer and editor!,"Beautifully photographed and a great idea, this book could have been much better if Nan used a better writer. I laughed so much reading the titles of the photos--they are hilarious! I thought she would be much more original and sophisticated than that. However it contains some good recipes."
5,GREAT BOOK,Nan; your book is excellent !!! I really enjoy it. Quentin Bacon photographs are also really great !!!! This is the best book on cooking I've ever seen.
4,Nan Gets Bum Rap,"Ok, Ok. So Nan didn't grow up as a Colonial Dame in Charleston or Boston, surrounded by heirloom silver and brass. So all the parishioners would be embarrassed for her should she set foot in an Episcopal church. She still has as much right to write a book on entertaining as Sally Quinn, Elsa Maxwell, or Letitia Baldrige. Now that I'm thinking about it, why doesn't Jayne Wrightsman write a party book? Or, for that matter, Princess Lee Radziwill? I think if Lee did that, it would be the biggest camp classic since Patrick Dennis's Little Me. She'd have to do it right, though; either get me or someone like Michael Musto to co-author it. Cheerio, dahlings!"
5,Thank You for this book!,"I wish I had read this book 10 years ago. Only in the last month or so have I come to realize the reality of my dilemma with my kids and pull out of ""denial"". After reading this book, (and it was very difficult and painful), I understand what my life has been for the last 10 years and how it will be better going forward. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be freed of the living hell of being a parent to a child that is an addict. I SO needed this book and all it has to offer. Now I can live. My hope is that my child will live too."
2,Not helpful,The book was not helpful. It certainly took away a lot of the guilt that a parent of a drug addicted child feels but it did not offer much positive support in my opinion. The bottom line advice is let go of the problem (and the kid) and go on with your life.
1,The author is bitter and has no hope.,"I read all the good reviews and ordered this book. After reading about all his experiences, I felt worse than I already did. This guy has given up, turned his back on his children to protect himself. There's a huge difference between turning your back and remaining hopeful and compassionate. Addicts need understanding, not bitterness and vitriol. I don't think he's moved on, as much as he'd like to say he has.There are MUCH better books on the subject, that will comfort you, and help you realize just how difficult the process of recovery is. You can help your loved one by informing yourself, living in hope, and living your own life so that you can be there when/if they do ask for help."
2,This book is not the answer to your problems!,"This book, while written with the intent to help parents in crisis, falls short of that goal. There is useful information in the book, but it is hard to find as you're sifting through the chapters. Most of the information is just common sense put to use. I would not recommend this book as an answer to parents who need real life altering help. It may be useful for families dealing with the first stages of drug addiction, but most of us don't realize the problem until we're in much deeper. Spend money on this book at your own risk...I don't believe it's the answer most of you are looking for!"
5,Don't Let Your Kids Kill You,"This book/guide is a ""tough love"" approach to the problem of drug or alcohol addicted adult children. It is a welcome and invaluable tool. I have read it through two times and found something new each time. I have also shared it with others."
5,Don't Let Your Kids Kill You,"This book spoke to me directly. It was as if I was reading about my own life and the lives of my addicted children and step-children. All the control issues and the bribes to control them. The money my husband and I spent. Thinking we were helping,when the money was going to buy drugs,not for food, electric bills or gasoline. The tickets I paid and excuses I made. I felt the need to highlight whole paragraphs and re-read them to let it sink in to my brain. I have bought over 10 copies for my Nar-Anon group friends and other parents I know and we all agree this book is a blessing."
5,Guide for Parents of Drug and Alcohol users,"This is a must-read, down-to-earth, book written by a parent and hits the nail on the head in all circumstances."
5,A life saver,"A must read for parents or involved adults of children that have, had,or may have substance abuse problems.Makes you feel like you are not alone. This book also tries to make you look at a big truth, which is if you don't take care of yourself, loving a kid with substance abuse problems WILL kill you emotionally and physically. A keeper for reference or support after you finish the book."
3,Don't Let Your Kids Kill You,This book had information we already know and should be using. It mostly says how you should take care of yourself and let your kid reach bottom before reaching out.
3,Makes ya' feel like a champ!!,"From the arena-ready anthem rockers to the shockingly awesome instrumentals, this one's guaranteed to get your fists pumpin', your heart a movin', and your blood a flowin'! Set your dreams into reality with the Rocky IV soundtrack!! I first heard this gem when I was 5 years old, and believe me, I was immediately hooked on all things Rocky!This album has its share of good, catchy rockers, plus a little soul, thanks to James Brown's ""Living in America"" anthem. I pledge allegiance to James Brown!!The best parts, however, would be the two instrumental tracks, which are a sure bet to get you off your lazy duff, and out onto the streets joggin'!Hey, quit watchin' that t.v. - Rocky don't like it....YO ADRIAN!!!!"
4,ROCKY IV---Excellent Music,"Sylvestor Stallone sure knows howto pick great artists to be onhis flicks. Some of the bestrock music comes from hisfilms, Rockys and Cobra.These 3 top rock bandsu gotta check out.Their musicianships isjust phenomenal:1/ Survivor (early albums, wow)2/ John Cafferty (voice of Eddie & Cruiser,all his songs sounds like Springsteen + 60's)3/ John Tepper (what a friggin' voice, dude rocks!)Hey, if u into scores, u gotta check outBill Conti's work also. The dude rocksin James Bond score, Rocky, and his earlytv soundtracks (rare albums)"
5,Perfect soundtrack for a second best Rocky film,"Rocky IV was always one my favorite movies back when I wasa kid in the mid 80's.. The soundtrack for this album playeda really big part in my interest in the movie. The solidband Survivor comes back with a another really good song""Burning Heart"" that helps make the movie worthwhile.. Butto me other than ""Eye of the Tiger"" the best track is ""NoEasy Way Out"" as the beat to that song is niffy and fitsit's part in the movie. The guy doing the singing is prettygood also.. And we have a niffy James Brown tune that getsdecent play in my cd player. The only song that had nointerest to me is ""Double Trouble"" as I can't say it's abad song... It just doesn't do anything for me.I wish there was some real rocking stuff on here... But Iguess it wouldn't fit aswell. Still one of the best soundtrack albums ever..."
5,Rocky is GOD,"This is a great CD. I like all the music on it. I listen to the CD at least 5 times a day. My favorite song is ""Eye Of The Tiger"". You should definatley get one of these."
4,good condition,I recieved the product in a timely fashion and I even got a discount on the shipping from the seller. It's not a brand new cd but it works great.
2,just like the movie its so bad its good...sort of,"well cant say this rocky album is one to stand the test of time, thanks to a snyth heavy soundtrack, and lots of cheesy but infectious arena rockers. but it really cant hold a candle to the more organic,memorable, and soulful orchestrations of thew original. It probablly still makes for good listenings to pump you up. but like its lame movie it leaves me cold. and the soundtrack features the skin and bones version of ""war"" which i recall has a wailing guitar solo and a more powerful punch to it, that was in the movie but absent from the soundtrack. most of the miniscule original orchestral composistions never made it to the cut sadly....and probablly will never see the light of day"
5,Inspiration Station!,"Second to the Bible, nothing is more uplifting and inspiring than the Rocky films. From small town nothingness to big city lights, Rocky overcomes his humble beginnings to excel to the heights of stardom. How did he do it? Nothing less than guts, motivation, drive, hard work, and a struggle to establish personal honor. Yet, there is one more thing, and that is nothing less than this WONDERFUL music. Though all the other Rocky soundtracks are great, Rocky IV is the superior. Depressed about your circumstances? Stand strong and take a listen to get instilled with the Eye of the Tiger! Remember, 'There's No Easy Way Out,' but you can do it if you want it bad enough! Overcome! Win, Rocky, Win!"
5,The best soundtrack from the series,"So many great songs on this one, all it's missing is the origianl theme. But well worth the purchase for eye of the tiger and burning heart. Go Rocky!"
5,Great CD for tango and Gardel fans!,"I picked this up with cusiosity. It was very well made. I was not familiar with Marcelo Alvarez and was very surprised by his good voice which resembles that of Placido Domingo strikingly. The arrangements of the original tango pieces were done very elegantly. As a matter of fact, I think some of them were done much better than in original Gardel's CDs. I highly recommend this CD."
5,OUTSTANDING BOOK!,"Keith Anderson obviously has a depth of understanding college students and the issues that they face. This book gives important advice to college students in a wide variety of situations that they may face during the first few years of college. I love this book and highly recommend it for students and even parents to read! It would make a great graduation gift or for anyone about to embark on the college journey, whether at a Christian college or not!"
5,LUCKY MAN,"Very interesting book. I learned a lot more about Parkinson's than I knew before, even though my father-in-law had this disease. Michael J Fox puts all his faults and battles out there for everyone to see. I only wish that everyone in this country who has Parkinson's was able to afford the kind of medical attention that Michael has. Good health care for this horrible disease does not insure the same kind of quality of life that Michael has, but I imagine that it sure would help. I would recommend this book to everyone."
4,Lucky Man,"This seems like an honest autobiography. Mr. Fox does not try to make himself look better; he admits his falling under the spell of his celebrity. However, the best part is how he became his own person again. He is dealing with Parkinson's disease and he is actively pursuing research through his foundation."
3,Not bad. Not too bad.,"This was good. Not as good as his first, I think. But not bad; not too bad. Twenty words to describe my experience? The best thing about my read was the Kindle, not really not Michael J. Kindle's great; Fox is okay."
3,Lucky Man,I enjoyed the book however I thought it would include more details about Parkinson's and how he coped with it in order to assist persons who have this condition as well as what research is discovering.I thougt the details of his life were a little long . Perhaps the title Lucky Man was intended to reveal more of his life and not as much about Parkinson's He was indeed a lucky man to be where he is today with his career as compared to his early problem filled years.It is refreshing to read what he has done to turn his life around. I hope this is read by a lot of young people.He deserved credit for what he has done for research in this area.It is easy to read.
5,Lucky Readers!,"Having grown up with Michael J Fox on Family Ties and Back to the Future, this book brought back memories, but also gave insight into the behind the scenes life. With the possibility that MJF is going to have a new series soon, it is even more timely to read this book and understand his struggles, wit, and bravery."
4,heartwarming story,I really enjoyed reading this book and really felt like I was having a conversation with Michael J Fox. It was very personal and very honest.
5,Wow on Wow,It is almost unbelievable what this man and those like him have gone through. To heck with Rush Limbaugh!
5,An Inspiring Biography,"Lucky Man by Michael J. Fox is an inspiring biography. Fox shares with us his life story starting with childhood and his early days as he tries to make it in Hollywood. All the way through Family Ties, Spin City, the Back to The Future movies and as he starts his family. It is inspiring to read how he deals with his Parkinson diagnosis, first trying to hide it, then finally publicly admiting it.The biography is very well written and a very easy read. Even if you did not follow Fox's tv shows and movies, you will find his story inspiring and moving."
5,A Roadmap Past Accetance To Gratitude,"Mr. Fox has eloquently recounted his journey through his debilitating crisis. He has exemplified in his memoir how to transform his curse, his anathema to a gift of discernment. He has graciously shown in his book his long road to gratitude and happiness in life. After reading through it, you will feel happy and thankful for Mr. Fox for the wisdom gained."
3,Good read,"This book is classic MJF. His brand of humor stamped on a very subjec that deserves respect. I recommend it. It is a easy read, and everthing leads to this moment he's in right now. the ending kind of came out of nowhere, but in this case, teh journey's better than the destination."
3,Interesting but slow,"Perhaps not being an American I'm not as familiar with the way America received the news that Fox had Parkinson's Disease, and therefore not as fascinated at how he would tell this story - but I didn't find myself engrossed in this book. I was interested to read Fox's tale of how he came to Family Ties, his discovery and eventual acceptance of the disease, and the downturn he experienced in his career during the early 90's, but for me the book moves slowly and Fox devotes too much time to recounting his emotional state of mind. It's not a particularly entertaining read either, Fox is clearly skilled in comedic acting rather than comedic writing. I don't think I feel Fox has left anything out of this book - perhaps he's just put too much in."
5,A Good Read,"It was a quick, fun, and inspiring read. If you have enjoyed Michael J. Fox's career, reading his life story will be time well-spent."
5,Well worth reading!!,"I can still remember the day I sat at a table next to Michael J. Fox in a Chicago restaurant. I was surprised how small he was, how handsome and well groomed. Silly as it was, I felt from that moment on that I would enjoy watching him as he grew old -like he was an old friend, brother or family member.. I had to buy this book as I was devastated to hear of his PD. The book is excellent!! It was all I hoped for and more. It is not often that we can get into the mind of someone living through a human experience like this. Most of us know someone who has one of these devastating diseases, this book teaches us how to deal with these precious people. I also bought this book on tape and found it to be the best way to read this book. Michael reads it, and he does a fabulous job. Buy it, I can't imagine anyone who would not appreciate it."
5,We are All Luckier now,"Michael J. Fox's ""Lucky Man"" is an incrediblely touching book. He offers complete insight into his life and how he felt after being diagnosed with Parkison's Disease. He talks about his struggles he has had through out the years while coping with his illness. It allows you to see into Fox's hopes, fears, pain and joys. This book is not only emotional, but extremely inspiring as well. After reading this, he not only has showed us how to laugh, and smile, he also shows a new way to look at life, and appreciate it. Michael J. Fox considers himself a 'Lucky Man' for everything he has experienced in the past ten years. This book has made me appreciate what I have, and taught me to not take for granted everything that I may have taken advantage of before in my life. His story is truly touching, and also has made me realize how lucky my life has been."
5,"A real ""Picker Upper""!","In the course of this book Mr Fox went from just another actor with money and perks to someone worth looking at as an example. Mr Fox shows a real ""positive"" look on life as he shows how the struggles of his life mixed with his own good fortunes have molded him into the man he is today. This book showed me the attitude nessisary to truely make ""lemonaid"" when life gives you ""lemons"". It's easy and fun to read!"
4,Lucky man review!,"I loved this book, Michael J Fox, is honest, no holds bar, tells it as it is, the good & the bad of his condition & how he copes with it !"
3,Lucky Man: A Memoir Michael J Fox,This book was a tedious read. I am a fan of Michael J and was hoping for a deeper insight into the goings-on with his Parkinsons
5,"Keep Kicking, Michael!","I read this book around the same time that I read Fran Drescher's ""Cancer Schmancer"" and I was impressed that neither performer gave in to personal feelings of despair and preferred instead to work towards making an even better life for themselves. In this book, Michael J. Fox gives an interesting and oftentimes funny look at his early years in Canada and Hollywood and the touching story of his love affair with the admirable Tracy Pollan. The book does begin to adopt a more somber tone when he begins to relate the first symptoms of Parkinson's disease and the road he has travelled with it ever since. Despite all of the pain and suffering involved with this horrible disease, Mr. Fox continues to work towards educating the public on Parkinson's and a strong belief in a cure. This is a book well worth reading."
2,Lucky Man,"The book is fairly well written and interesting. To come from Mr. Fox's humble beginings and rising to the top of the entertainment industry is an accomplishment of which he can be proud. It is sad that he chose to politicize his situarion to the degree he did. Roy Long, Temple, TX."
3,"Mike, we hardly knew 'ye","Michael J. Fox has written a decent book, I'll give him that. But there wasn't enough of the ""Cher snubbed me"" or ""Eric Stoltz screwed up 'Back to the Future'"" factoids to make it particularly biting or interesting. MJF also does a fair job of trying to blur aspects of his character, such as his politics, while at the same time he feigns total candor.And may I say how glad I am he found his wife. The combination of an Canadian enlisted man's son and an Upper East Side, Park Avenue living, privately-schooled JAP actress is a little odd. But God bless 'em."
3,Lucky Man,The book was an interesting read and I did find out some things I never knew about Michael. Unfortunately I found the egocentricity and self pity a little hard to take at times. Towards the end of the book I found it easier to read as he came to terms with his Parkinson's and accepted what lay ahead. Not a book I would highly recommend.
4,Lucky Man,"Fascinating read about an interesting guy, I particularly liked his reflections on success and how hard he worked on the movie sets and TV shows in the early years of making it big in Hollywood."
4,mominmontevallo,Enjoyed this book very much. Michael J Fox is a very brave man for putting him and how Parkinson's is affecting him out there for all to see. He is a champion for his actions and efforts to educate and fight this horrible disease.
5,Lucky Man,"Michael J Fox's book was worth reading. He has always been a beloved actor. Now he is also a beloved man. He explained his journey with such honesty. Even including the less than flaterning aspects. I think this will give hope to those who are dealing with the devestating news of life stealing illness'. I applaud you Michael and especially, your lovely wife Tracy. She held to be accountable and not let you continue on what could have been a life long downslide. You are in fact a Lucky Man ! I look forward to your work in the future and will now support your foundation. Thank you for being a part of our lives and allowing us to share a part of yours !"
4,Refreshing Reaf,I enjoyed this book much more than I initially thought I would. Fox is straightforward with his story from his work/family/friends and Parkinson's. One gets a sense of the person behind the image. He does not portray himself as a victim of either hollywood or his disease. Overall is is a refreshing read and he shows the reader how his journey let him to his political/social actions regarding Parkinson's today.I slap enjoyed his reflections on his siblings and Nana!
5,Inspirational and insightful!,"My husband had PD and died as a result at an early age. Michael's personality and self reflection, lacking self pity really gives a voice to those who often silently suffer with this terrible disease."
4,Lucky Man,"Lucky me. I needed a change of pace from my from my usual reading habits.Have been a long time fan of Michael J. Fox. In real live he seems to be aslively & entertaining as most of his movie characters(as per his book).Throughly enjoyed this book,which showed up on my kindle offers. I always check them out so I don't miss something good."
5,Understanding an Incurable Disease,This candid biography is excellent in helping people deal with an Incurable diisease. It is well written. I did not understand this disease at all. It is also a beautiful love story.
4,LUCKY MAN,REALLY INTERESTING. THIS BOOK REALLY TAUGHT A LOT ABOUT TWO THINGS. PARKINSONS DISEASE AND COURAGE. YOUR DOING A GOOD JOB MICHAEL J. FOX.!
5,An inspiration to us all!,"After seeing Michael J. Fox on the Late Show with David Letterman promoting his new book I was amazed at how positive and happy he was. I wanted to know what made him such a lucky man, so I picked up a copy of his book. He tells a good deal about his past, more than I expected, and then focuses on his diagnosis and how it has affected his life up until now. Not only is this book a must for anyone with Young Onset PD, it's for anyone who could benefit from a more positive outlook in life no matter what their going through. Out of all the role models in today's society, Michael J. Fox is my number one on my list. After reading this book, you just might feel the same way. I'm glad he wrote this book because not only will it help those who are dealing with Parkinson's disease, it helps people like me understand what it's like to be in their shoes. Michael J. Fox is an inspiration to us all."
5,Best description of Parkinson's daily life,"This book is great to explain Parkinson's to those who don't have it. Mr. Fox wrote very well, without a ghost writer."
4,Enjoyable read,"Michael J. Fox feels like someone a lot of us know in that we saw him so much on both the small and large screen. I could really identify with his struggle although I have never had to deal with Parkinson's or any other debilitating disease like it. Overall, it was interesting and he kept it light enough to make it enjoyable but also revealed a lot more about himself than I expected."
4,A book of courage and acceptance.,"Seeing I was a girl who grew up in the 1980's during the Back to the Future and Family Ties craze, I have always loved MJF. The fact that he was from Western Canada only made him that much better. I had MJF posters on my walls from all the teen magazines always hoping I would meet some one as cool as Marty McFly and live happily ever after.Reading Lucky Man showed me the other side of Mr. Fox. It exposed to me to all the ups and downs he went through when he was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's disease. It took extreme courage to write this memoir and made publicly known how hard it is to sometimes accept what happens in life. MJF has helped bring awareness to Parkinson's disease it is just too bad that it took some famous to turn people's attention to this disease."
3,"3+ stars--Stick with it, the book gets good.","I really enjoyed this book because it seemed Michael J Fox was right in the room with me telling his story. It was interesting reading his thought processes. However, I had a hard time sticking with the book in the beginning pages 1-62. For me, it seemed to jump around and had some sentences/passages that I would have edited out (sorry, Michael). BUT, the book picks up at chapter three and is very rewarding and inspiring (without being mushy) to read. I've never read a celebrity autobiography before since I'm not that interested in Hollywood (unless it's Woody Allen), but Michael seems a man of substance. I was surprised. I believe any fan or non-fan will find this a good read."
5,Even Better Than I'd Hoped,"I grew up watching Michael J. Fox on TV and eagerly looked forward to this biography. Almost too eagerly....I must have read 10 reviews including lengthy excerpts and by the time I did all that, I hesitated to get the book because I felt like I must have already read it, and besides, aren't the excerpted parts probably the best parts?Boy, was I in for a touching, surprising, and consistently page turning ride. Every part of the book is that honest, that funny, and occasionally, it does make you moved to tears. He does manage to be a funny and nice guy and yet at the same time let you see sides of himself - which he has since dealt with and overcome - that I'm not sure most of us would reveal to any but our closest friends.I stayed up way too late last night finishing it because even though it wasn't a thriller, you do get more and more drawn in.Bottom line, even if you've read the reviews ad nauseum, I promise you'll enjoy every minute of this book."
5,Incredibly well written Amazon Kindle Edition of Lucky Man,I was drawn into reading Michael's book due to his incredible attitude about his Parkinson's.. The book in so honest and heartfelt. It was like looking thru a window into such personal moments of his life.. I would invite all to read it as it could change the way you view difficulties in your own life.I highly recommend this book.
4,Good Read,This book gave you an insight of the ups and downs in the life of Michael J Fox. I would have given the book 5 stars but some parts of the book just ran on with what I call filler facts to make the book longer. It brings to life how down to earth MJF is and how special of a person Tracy(his wife)is.
4,"Inspirational, insightful and informative!",Michael J. Fox revealed so much about his personal and professional life and educated the reader about Parkinson's disease. An easy read with a very personal and insightful message. I was never a great fan of his acting but after reading his book I'm in awe of his honesty and spirit!
5,A wonderfull book about a real human being,"Listening to or reading ""Lucky Man"" should be a must for everyone. Michael J. Fox never asks for pity but instead paints a honest and deep reaching portrait of himself (in other words the flaws and virtues that make each of us human are displayed in the pages of this wonderfull book)."
5,Humble,"this was a great read, i couldn't put it down. i just had to finish it. this was such a powerful book. mjf was very honest with us in telling his story. thanks for the book micheal.paul perry"
2,Perhaps for hard-core fans and personal friends only,"This autobiography would be great for the absolute biggest fans, or, perhaps, personal acquaintances, of Michael J. Fox. For those of us who have just watched him on television, though, this book is perhaps a bit much, going into very intricate and intimate detail regarding his personal life and his struggle with Parkinson's Disease. Those with the disease, however, may take comfort from how Fox himself has battled and refuses to give up."
4,I liked this more than I thought I would,"I purchased Lucky Man as a Kindle deal and afterward, wondered why I had. What did I have in common with Michael J. Fox, anyway?What I found was an intriguing, well-thought out and nicely written memoir from one of the biggest celebrities of the 1980s. He deftly describes his ascending stardom and almost concurrent descent into the grips of Parkinson's.I found his devotion to his wife and family refreshing and his ultimate introspection to be quite profound."
5,Lucky Man,"I've always like MJ Fox and I've read about his disease and how strong he has been in fighting it. This book give others hope and also gives info regarding this disease. It is not because he is an actor, but because in this book he is another human being reaching out to others to give hope."
4,Lucky Man,"I enjoyed watching Famly Ties as a teenager and was a fan of Michael J. fox. I was sad to hear the new of his diagnosis of Parkinson's at such a young age. When I discovered that he had written this book, of course, I had to read it!There is alot of information of the challenges that he and his family experience on a daily basis with trying to live a normal life, work and dealing with a life changing illness. Tracy is a very supportive wife.Since Michael's diagnosis and fight to improve Parkinson's study and treatment, I think there are more people who are aware of the disease and it is more widely discussed and understood. My hope is that someday there will be a successful treatment to end the progression of this disease.This was a good read! Very informative."
4,above and beyond--pure courage,Makes you wonder if you would have the courage displayed by Mr. Fox. He shows how he came to this decision but it has to be more than that. His love for his wife and children are greatly shown and his love for life follows in order. I hope his courage and commitment will be seen by all and this dreaded affliction will be counquered in the near future.
4,Audio version availability,Working with a visually handicapped university student in need of an audio version of this book. Have already tried the reader service that provides most of her texts; not available through them. Would appreciate any information you might have. Thanks
5,How to justify a Technical Editor on your staff,"This book is particularly useful in defining the role of your Technical Editor, but what I found useful was the way the author addressed the need for a technical editor. In many technical writing and documentation groups, a technical editor is not in place because they use peer edits instead. Peer edits are not as effective as a technical editor! This book addresses quantitative results of having or not having a technical editor and how to ""sell"" your management on adding a technical editor to your team.I would recommend this book to writers, so that they may better understand the role of their editor. I would recommend this book to editors, so that they may better understand how to work with writers effectively. And I would recommend this book to any documentation manager or communications manager who is considering hiring a technical editor or trying to gain management approval for hiring a technical editor."
5,"She's done it, not merely taught it.",I could tell at once that she has been an editor and not merely taught technical writing at some college. What she says is real
2,It's better than the video shows it!,We went to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks three years ago and fell in love with them. When I came across this video I thought it would be great even though it was rather an old tape. I was very disapointed in it. I got so tired of seeing mud boiling that I nearly fell asleep. The scenery of Yellowstone is so much more than geysers and steamy places yet that is mostly what this video showed. I think Grand Teton N.P is one of the most beautiful places on earth (you know there really has to be a God when you see those mountains in the sunlight!). This park might have been given 7 or 8 minutes (at the most) in this overly long video. If you can find this for a buck or so at a yard sale and have some time you want to fill then I guess this might be O.K. but it really does not do justice to our nations premier National Parks.
1,I was looking for a book not a tape cassete.,"Today I used your search machine looking for a book and bought thinking I was buying a book, and when I received my order confirmation #104-0835139-3206048, I discovered that I bought a tape. No problem, but I bought a CD set from the same author, and I was looking for a exercise book. I'm very angry about this."
4,Worked OK,worked fine. advertising didn't explain what you get very clearly- I only needed one of the chargers but bought the kit because at the time I couldn't tell if I needed an adapter.
5,Must have for your tool box.,"This product is well-built. Very lightweight and compact. Can be kept in your pocket. Or hanging from your pant pocket without dragging the whole pocket down with it. Blades are coated to resist corrosion, according to manufacturer, and this is good as long as you do not scrape the blades against stone, concrete, or metal often. If this is the case, store it in a clean dry place to prolong blade life and to prevent scuffed blades from rusting. Top blade lock works like a champ and not annoying like the bottom blade lock version, also produced by Stanley. I also have the 16' and 25' versions, which works equally well if not better."
1,"It doesn't ""standout""","I bought this tape because the ""technical details"" said it had a ""9 foot standout""; it has a ""4 foot standout"". If you want a ""9 foot standout"" buy a Stanley FatMax. -- By the way, I own over 10 Stanley tapes; they are the best on the market."
4,unbelievably funny!,"Whatever the message is in this movie, I still laugh every time I see it. After all, Adam Sandler is there wondering where to hide the weed. It is great performance by everybody."
4,I bought it and I'm not sorry!,"Yes, as many have pointed out, The Hot Chick is a stupid movie with a stupid plot. However, if you are looking for some outrageous laughs, this is the DVD for you.Rob Scheider is cute, funny and his performance is a scream. I am not sorry I purchased it. So, sue me."
3,Good reminder of the early 2000s,"If you're looking to remind yourself of the early years of the new millennium via film, this would be my recommendation. I loved this movie then, and even now it still makes me chuckle. Weird? Yes. Campy? Yes. Oscar worthy? Not even if you drugged the entire nomination committee. All in all, three stars. Lower your expectations, then rent this movie when you're bored."
5,The Hot Chick,"This is a very funny movie. An attractive and popular teenager who is mean spirited toward others, finds herself in the body of an older man, and must find a way to get back to her original body."
4,let loose and laugh,"If you can watch it, and try to picture if the things in the movie were really happening to you or a friend, you can get into it more. Rob is stupid but thats what makes him so funny and easy to watch.....look for all the little jokes they add in, little scenes like that are precious!"
1,DVD was damaged.,"Shipping for this item was fast and the price was good. However when I actually watched it, it was so badly scratched in certain parts that I had to skip ahead. So basically I can't watch it all the way through. I thought it was used but still in decent condition, not so. Very disappointing."
3,Rob Schneider at his best ;),"I'd give this two stars really, though I stuck an extra one in for Rob Schneider's performance.Cheesy ancient treasure in modern times causing a 'body swap' between a middle aged man(criminal) and a high school girl(tramp). Until the actual 'body swap' happens, you'll have to put up with about 30 nearly intolerable minutes of high school cheerleader crap, watching girls go to the mall and shop and act like the complete airheads they are supposed to be. If you haven't turned it off by that point (it was a close thing for me) then it does actually start to get funny, once the 'accident' happens.This movie is a light hearted comedy that doesn't take it self at all seriously and can be amusing to watch in the same way that other Sandler/Schneider films have been. Though I wouldn't consider it one of the better of the ""Happy Madison"" productions; its forgettable."
4,We Laughed and Laughed and Laughed,"My wife and I are big Rob Schneider fans however, after seeing the trailer (which usually highlights the best of the movie) and reading the reviews, we felt that this movie didn't even deserve a rental. Then, Starz showed it on a free preview weekend. Feeling we had nothing to lose we watched it. Yes, it was very predictable and had plently of bathroom humor but the bottom line is, it was very entertaining. Its been a long time since my wife and I watched a movie together where we both laugh ourselves into tears."
4,it was good!,"I'm from the UK so have just seen this film at the cinema. I really liked the look of the film from the trailers, though i did read a really bad review of it on teletext.co.uk. I still went to see the film and I'm really glad I did! It's not a major complicated film and sometimes you dont need it to be! I just fancied having a few laughs and that's exactly what I got. I really like the fact that adam sandler is always is his films and vice versa! Yes, there were cheesy lines and american stereotypes, but hey, that's all part of the fun of it. Critics who review these films think they obviously are always right and dont even consider the target audience. I'm 21 and I dont consider myself to be a 'moron' who has no intellectual capacity thank you very much! It's a fun light-hearted film that many of you enjoy - definitely watch it!"
4,Better than Thought,"You know I remember seeing the previews on tv for the movie and all I can think of is how that would probably one of the DUMBEST movies I have ever seen made. Once I saw it, my mouth stays shut, but not during the movie. I was laughing the WHOLE time! It was very amusing. It was worth watching it. And, I would watch it again."
4,Surprisingly good,"I got dragged to see this movie by one of my good friends who has a thing for Matthew Lawrence (mind you she is 25 years old!) Anyhoo, I made sure to get comfy before the movie because I was prepared to sleep through it. I'm not a big fan of slapstick humor and Rob Schneider is the king of stupid movies. But I was surprised to see this movie is actually very funny! I found myself laughing out loud through most of the movie. I was also pleasantly surprised to see all of the extras on the DVD including an alternate ending. Check this movie out"
4,Stupid but funny,"This movie is stupid but I did laugh a lot. Rob Schneider plays a girl very well. Just pure, stupid fun. Were you expecting anything less from Schneider?"
5,HOT CHICKY,This is a way funny movie but sort of reminded me of Freaky Friday. My kids laughed there bums off. It was just a fun wacky movie.
4,Better Than What I Expected,"I was afraid this movie was going to be a total let down, until I saw this movie. The Preview doesn't OVER-DO it with included all the funny parts. Because the preview left out most of the funny clips, which Im glad they did. Anyways, Hot Chick is a really funny movie if you are a fan of Rob. The chick in the movie who he changes bodies with, is very hotttt. Thats worth seeing the movie alone.Overall- If you want a laugh, rent Hot Chick or even buy it. Its worth it."
3,Not that Bad,"I do not know what anyone expects when they see this movie. From the trailers I never expected it to not suck. I was pleasantly surprised.It is not worth the $17.99 it is still listed as, but it is worth a rental. The cast of girls and the interaction with Rob Schneider makes for some amusing scenarios.The plot is not surprising, but it is not insulting - given the premise. It doesn't bog down in lessons or morales. I was again surprised.If you are a Rob Schneider fan, you will enjoy it. If you are not, but have been sucked into seeing Gigilo and Animal, this will offer a little forgiveness."
4,A must have for anyone planning a Safari to Africa,"Don't be fooled, planning a safari requires a great deal of information and this book is loaded with detailed descriptions and personal insights. We have been to Southern Africa once and I would not consider planning a trip again without a book like Mark's. He tells you exactly what animals can be seen where and what time of year. This is especially important with such a huge difference in seasons."
4,A must read for those going to Africa,"A good review of the various wildlife camps, lodges in Africa as well as highlights of each of the major National Parks and Game Reserves. It included quite reliable descriptions of camps based upon the many we visited. It is a much better purchase than similar books we looked at in terms of useful information."
2,Not worth the high price!,"Well, I guess this is one for the Pink fairies completist, but I dont reccomend it for the casual fan. 4 of the studio tracks are from Twink's ""Think Pink"" lp. Theres a demo version of ""Do It"" and the rest are live tracks. The 2 live versions of ""Mexican Grass War"" & ""Why Does A red Cow"" are unsatisfying and unecessary. So that leaves the live versions of ""Do It"", ""Uncle Harry's Last Freakout"", & ""The Snake"" to justify this cd. Well guess what ? The sound quality isnt too good!I originally gave this 3 stars because I like the Fairies, but writing this made me realize this is a pretty bad cd. Buy ""Think Pink"" & you have the best songs on this comp.Its Definitely NOT worth the high price being asked (unless youre a complete Fairies nut). Luckily I got mine cheap."
4,Pay homage to the original.,"Without a doubt their signature song is; Do It. And a reviewed mention of the Rollins Band, doing a kick'in cover of it, is worthy of mention. BUT, not so fast. What I feel is the best (pushed to it's limits) cover of this song, appeared on a compilation album/CD. Entitled; Human Music on Homestead Records. It's the last track, performed by; Death of Samantha. Take my word, you'll love it!!"
1,Customer Service NON-EXISTENT,"I purchased an 8 foot ballet bar for my daughter. I checked the package for all the parts since the box had been damaged during shipment and they all were there. When I tried to put it together Christmas Eve,the holes were not placed in the bar that was sent to me to attach the legs. There were no instructions as to where the holes should be, so I contacted Amazon and the seller (on Christmas Eve). Still have not heard back from the seller...and it is now New Year's Day. I submitted this review before, but it was not posted."
4,"Plenty of lather, doesn't smell like Yucca Dew though.","No problem with lather that prior reviewer ""hate to shop"" experienced. I got plenty of lather from a small amount of shampoo. It cleans my hair pretty much like every other shampoo I've used. My expectation/hope was for the smell of long-discontinued ""Yucca Dew"". Unfortunate homonyms for Yucca Dew might be why it's not here: ""What's that scent in your hair?"" ""Why, it's yuck-a-doo..."" Putting ""yuck"" and ""doo"" in a product's name, even with sound-alike words, isn't usually well received. Anyway, loved that stuff, and hoped this smelled like that. It doesn't, alas. Since it's not ~advertised~ as smelling like Yucca Dew, I don't feel it should lose more than a single point. So, perfectly acceptable shampoo does what shampoo does: it lathers, rinses, (don't need to repeat), cleans hair. I'm not very demanding of a shampoo. If some company would buy the rights and bring back Yucca Dew, I would be even happier."
2,Did not like,"It made my hair soft, but I had to use a lot just to get my hair clean. I doesn't lather."
1,Lather?,"being the container says shampoo on it I would think it would lather, it doesn't. They even sent me a new bottle just in case there was a little mix up at the plant. The new one doesn't lather either. I personally don't like shampoo that doesn't lather. It has the same look, smell, and consistency of the conditioner. Did anyone else try this shampoo? does it lather for you?"
5,Available Again. Excellant.,"One of the best books I have ever read or given to family/friends (I have bought 10+ copies since it was first published...too bad the original hard copy version is no longer available...mine is now in rough shape). My favorite climbing book of all time. Inspired. Be humbled with Child, then grab your gear... After this read, 'Deborah & Mountain of my Fear'."
2,Very dry,"I am a big fan of the Blue Guide series, I wouldn't want to go to Europe without one. However, this is one I left at home. The author takes you on a road trip around the Loire Valley and comments on every village he passes through even though most have absolutely nothing in them. The major chateaux are given quite a bit of space, especially their architecture but not much on the historical context. The entire book was very dry. I do not buy the Blue Guides for their advice on how to get around, but I certainly expected something better than this."
3,Old-fashioned,You will prefer Eyewitness Loire Valley guide book. Dorling Kindersley; ISBN: 0789404265 because of its pictures and detailed visual explanations.
1,Item was not what I was looking to buy.,I thought that this was an adapter from SCSI to USB. That is what my amazon search was. From the picture provided it was not possible to determine that the one end was not a USB connection.
4,Great Solution at a decent price,"Bought this product to help allow my two car garage to actually hold two cars. Once installed, I am quite pleased with the function of this item. Granted, it takes what seems to be hours to get the lift up and down, but once it's up, it's up - and by lowering the shelf it is a lot easier to load and unload than non-moving units.When installing this item - take your time and download the instructional video. The paper instructions included are not nearly detailed enough and you can easily end up having to backtrack and fix some of your installation.I would also like to see a different gear ratio for the drive gears. As it is now, the lift takes quite a while and a fair amount of strength and stamina to raise and lower - maybe there should be a drill attachment - hmmmm?!Pros* Overhead Storage* Don't need a ladder to accessCons* Takes a long time and a sturdy arm to raise and lower* Installation can be tricky"
5,Great storage solution!!,"I installed 2 of these in my garage, they work great. I can store my lawn mower, edger & blower on one of them. It is a little slow to crank up & down but well worth the extra space they free up. I actully use my 1/2"" cordless drill to raise & lower as reccomended by another reviewer. Also be aware that these only lower 8 feet from the ceiling. I changed the cables on mine to make them lower to the floor from my 10 ft ceiling (cost $17.00 each for cables from Lowes)."
4,Great product!,I bought this item to use to lift the top off my 4 door Jeep Wrangler. It works perfect! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is there is a design flaw. When you tighten the J hooks down it causes the bar to rotate. There is no way to fix this problem. Other than that the product is great.
5,good racks,"Racks went up easily. All the parts were there. i think the gear ration on the lift could be faster--it takes too long to raise and lower, but that is minor and can be overcome with a power drill."
1,Bad Quality,"Unfortunately, the quality was so poor I had to return the storage rack. The ""j"" bolts were too short and had stripped out threads. This product should never have passed quality inspection. I would not recommend this product!"
4,"Works great, but assembly could have been easier","As others have noted, the j-hooks are of inconsistent quality. I was able to make all of them work by eliminating a few washers, but better quality control is called for. Otherwise, this thing went together smoothly and works as advertised. A great solution to my garage storage needs."
5,Out of the way storage,"The storage unit worked as described. Installation was easy with the mounting bars aligning with standard joist dimensions. Once installed the unit was easy to raise and lower using a battery operated drill and the drill attachment. However, once loaded, the drill did not have sufficent torgue to raise the unit. The unit also comes with a manual crank (big plus for Racor). We shifted to the manual crank and was able to lift the load without difficulty. Suggestions to the manufactor include using a quick release mechanism to shift between drill and manual interconnects (currently connects via bolt and nut)and also provide an option to extend the length of the cables by four feet or so.."
3,Time consuming to install and poor hardware. Plan ahead.,"The produc itself is a good one. The hardware is shoddy. The j-bolts included are too short. You wil need to replace 12-bolts at your local hardware store. The directions are also written poorly and out of order. I spent about 6 hours assembling and installing the first lift, and another 2 hours on the second once I learned how to do it properly after muddling through the instrucions on the first pass. Be warned and know what you are getting into before you buy and begin a long day installing."
3,Replace Hardware Prior to Install !!!,"The hardware (nuts/bolts etc.) included with this unit is worthless. It's poor quality and does not properly fit the pre drilled holes - very sloppy. I would expect that if you are buying any type of lift assembly it would ship with components that provide stability and safety. I ended up replacing all of the hardware and noticed a dramatic difference. Also, the bar in the middle that turns both ends, simutaniously raising and lowering the cables, is made of two seperate pieces of thin box tubing connected at the middle with a single bolt. If you don't replace this bolt the bar wobbles back and forth virtually under any weight you try and raise."
2,It works but stripped threads don't inspire confidence,I just spent about two hours putting one of these up. It's a great concept but the hardware they supply is cheap. I had a bunch of stripped bolts and the two big washers that hold the winding axle in place were missing.For something that's going to sit above my car the cheap hardware doesn't inspire confidence.
5,Racor cable-lifted storage rack,"This garage storage lift is an excellent product. Easy to assemble and works flawlessly.I did wish there was an electrified version, but then solved the problem.Simply use only the upper part of the two part crank handle (the one with the hook) and chuck it into a 1/2"" electric drill as you would a drill bit. Use the drill on low speed and you've got a garage lift without any effort on your part."
5,Racor heavy lift,"Great product, Fairly easy to install by 1 person, 2 people would make go faster. Plan on 45 minutes or so with 1 person with proper tools. Once installs it functions perfectly and is stable, strong and secure. I used some bungee cords to hook onto the eye hooks to hold boxes in place. This product is definitely worth twice the price."
3,Great mechanism poor hardware,I use this to hang a vintage canvas canoe in my 12 foot ceiling garage. The mechanism is excellent but I found the hardware to be of poor quality. Took a long time to assemble which was made particularly disgusting because of the hardware.
4,"Great Product, even better customer service","I am using this lift to store an ARB Simpson III roof top tent (120lbs). It is a great product. My only complaint is that the included drill attachment to raise and lower the lift is larger than what my drills' chuck can accommodate. Aside from that, I dropped the center spindle with the cable nylon stops on it and cracked one of the nylon ""pucks"" in half. I do wish it would have been made out of aluminum or a harder abs material. Emailed Customer service and received a response that day. 5 stars for customer service, they are professional, polite and genuinely seem to get my issue resolved. I would definitely consider Racor products for future purchases.It helps to assemble and measure everything on the floor first, then you can mark the drill holes using the two assembled arms. Install time by myself was about an hour. Take your time, measure and make things square."
2,Fire your instructuions writers...,"Original review is below. I'll increase this by 1 star up to 4 for every week this continues to function. It'll never get 5 stars. Absolute worst instructions I've ever seen. Will I buy more, yes. Now that I don't need instructions I can install this in less than an hour.*******************************************************************************************************************I'm not done with this yet. I fiddled with most of the afternoon yesterday only to resort to instructions posted on an Amazon review. Hire THAT guy to write your instructions and fire everyone else. When I'm done installing this mess today, I might change the rating if it works. All I gotta say is that it better clear 24"" as it says or I might be ripping it from the ceiling and leaving it on the curb for trash. Seriously Racor...with all the bad reviews on your instructions, do something about it."
5,More than happy with this item... it was just what I needed!!!,I had been looking for a way to store our new kayaks up out of the way and our garage was already full so this was an excellent fit to what I needed to make sure our boats stayed out of the elements. It definitely is easier having 2 people do this... you'll save yourself a lot of frustration in holding things up! Customer service was excellent direct from the company in answering questions about how the framing around the rack fit. The longer outside braces that the wire shelving attach to kept flipping up from the bottom when you're tightening the bolts. I kept them slightly loose till I had the cables attached and then tightened them down...the weight of the shelf bearing down on the framework did the job in holding them in place. I think it could be designed better in that respect but after getting past that it was just fine.I'll be able to put 2 kayaks side by side (depends on your kayak sizes of course) so this is great.
4,Great Product - Labor Intensive Install,"The HeavyLift is awesome! Does exactly what we need it to do. The hand crank gives you quite a workout - it takes a few minutes to raise or lower it, but it gets up and out of the way.Installation is a different matter. The arms are heavy enough that working over-head for any period of time is challenging. I recommend creating a template, predrilling the holes, and using a cordless drill to install the bolts. Having two people would have made the chore much easier.Overall great product - you'll soon forget the pain it was to get the thing installed!"
1,Did not live up to expectations,"I purchased this item based on 3 glowing recommendations. When the kit arrived, the original box was in sorry shape, held together only by a large amount of packing tape.I attempted to put the product together, only to find that the bottom grate (which you put items on when completed) would not sit flush with the crossbar. The method of securing the grate to the bar were J-hooks, and did not function as required. Plus, one of the hooks were not threaded as the others - requiring a call to the manufacter to replace. I am thoroughly displeased, and returning this item promptly. I can't believe that it would hold 260 pounds. Looks like I need to find another storage solution."
3,Good Finished Product..Instructions Poor,Product works as described. It requires some effort leveling the platform after assembly by adjusting cable length.The problem with this made in China piece is that the drawings included with the instructions are terrible and completely useless. The written instructions are ok but putting the thing together is somewhat of a jigsaw puzzle.
3,great product but...,"The product seemed a terrific solution. I read user reviews about how best to install it rather than use the manufacturer's instructions. Turns out I have a false ceiling in my garage and it would have been too difficult and expensive to install. I had to return the product, much to my dismay. I was pretty bummed. Thank you, Amazon, for your seamless and quick and easy return process."
4,Good out of the way storage area,The storage rack was easy to install and easy to use. Why 4 out of 5 stars...cranking the rack up and down takes a little doing.
3,Doesn't reach floor,My garage ceiling is 12' the lift stops about 3+ feet from the floor. I got it to raise heavier items to a storage area. When I inquired about using a longer cable the mfg said no but couldn't tell me why. I found out when I tried. The cross bar that the cable winds on is a bit weak in the center when the cable winds past the alloted wind area it bent the bar at it's connection. Due to the bend one side winds backward over itself (at a quicker take up rate) that make the platform very crooked. All in all the product is ok but at 3+ feet from the floor or crooked is of limited use. I will try to retro fit a winding cross bar to fix my issue. But be aware that the supplied cable limits the use on higher ceiling.
5,Storage- overhead in garage,Excellent productWell madeEasy to assembleand mountHighly recommend because it has good storage capacity and easy to operate
3,Love/Hate,"Pros: works great and luckily didn't have any problems with the lag bolts that many did (maybe they've been improved?)Cons: poor instructions/diagrams (IKEA way better), one cable set on mine was a different length than the other which makes it impossible to level completely, even with maximum adjustment to the beam height via the looped bolts."
4,Pro Lift Storage Rack,"Nice Rack. We found this lifter in the Sky Mall magazine on a flight, then ckecked it out on Amazon ($80 less). I store my motorcycle trailer on it during the winter months. The specs are a bit miss-leading. It states that it works for ceiling to 10 feet. At 10 feet the lift platform does not reach the floor. The maximum lift is more like 8 feet."
1,Don't Buy This Product,"This is a great product-in theory. In practice, it is very difficult to install, especially if you are trying to do so alone. The supplied J hooks are too short-in some cases not long enough to include the washer-and the crank requires herculian strength to raise the rack when it is fully loaded (at less than 250 lbs.) I called Racor complaining about both the short J hooks and stiff crank gear box, and they sent me replacements. Exactly like the originals.Given the difficulty of raising the rack, it is not worth the extreme effort required to install it. I would recommend instead installing fixed celining racks and using a ladder to load and unload them."
3,Not quite 12 feet...,"For those of you that read the specs and see ""for ceiling up to 12'"", just be aware that this only comes down 7.5 feet from the ceiling. So while it technically works on a 12' ceiling, the lowest the platform comes is 4.5 feet off the ground. Even with an 8' ceiling, it won't touch the ground. I consider this pretty misleading.Also, I ordered two of these units and had to take an angle grinder to both to get the gearbox to fit on due to poor tolerances on the welds.Overall, it works and is well priced, but the specs are misleading and it could use a touch more quality control."
5,perfect,"Works great...I have two in my garage. Installation wasn't hard, either. The only drawback is that the cables only allow the rack to be lowered 8ft. and I have 12ft. garage ceilings, so it's a few feet off the ground when fully lowered. No big deal though, great product. The new version has an attachment so that you can use your drill to raise and lower the rack, too. this helps a lot. (if you have a strong drill)"
4,cable lifted storage rack,I bought 3 racks for the garage and found them pretty easy to assemble. I suggest using a partner to hang the brackets to the ceiling. Because holding up the bracket and trying to attach it to the ceiling and keep things square is difficult for one person. But that seemed to be the only difficult part of the installation.The racks work very well.I would use a drill to run the hand crank. The gearing is very small so it can lift up to 250 lbs. The manual mentions this fact.We are very pleased. good product.
4,Performed as advertised,"This is a quality product that was fairly easy to put together. I must say the paper directions were just ok. The images could have been drawn better. I used the video directions on the Racor company website when the paper directions were not clear. This product performs as advertised. I would like to add that I first put together this storage rack and then modified it to create a hanging light system for use in my printing studio. After elongating the crank shaft that connects the two pulley system ends I was able to suspend my 14 foot horizontal rack of track lights. I now can raise and lower my lighting system by using the hand crank that attaches to the gearbox. It takes quite a bit of easy hand cranking to raise and lower the system. Once I attached a cordless power drill to the pole with the attachment that comes with the kit, raising and lowering the unit is now even easier and much faster."
5,Racor PHL-1R Pro Heavy lift,"Just purchased this item. For the most part it was easy to follow the instructions. I tend to read too much into the reading of instructions. After it was all put together and hanging in our garage we did what someone else had recommended and positioned it at the lowest level and weighted it down. We left it hang over night to make sure that it was secure. The next day we took it up to the maximum allowed with the load on and let it hang for a day or two. We use an electric drill to raise and lower the unit. It works great but make sure you have a drill with a half inch chuck, quarter inch won't work without adapting it somehow. This item sure gave us some needed floor space in the garage. We have even discussed getting another unit and probably will in the near future."
2,Installation Nightmare,The installation instructions for this were a nightmare (major translation issues - we tried both the English and Spanish versions - both were BAD) and many of the nuts and bolts required for assembly were not included in the package. The bolts that are included are all metric sizes making finding the appropriate size nuts difficult. All in this took over 5 hours and 3 trips to Home Depot to install. If you can get through the installation its a decent storage shelf but not sure it is worth the headache.
4,"Good Lift, But Bad Screw","As mentioned in all of the other reviews, product works as described but has very cheap lag bolts (I twisted the heads off of four of them with very little pressure).Instructions could have better discriptions and illustrations. A couple of the steps are incorrect for installing the cable winding shaft."
5,Pleased WOW,What you see is what you get!Its A GEM!OK took me 2hrs to install.....SO WHAT?Its Fantastic!!!Buy IT!!!!Perfection!!!
3,ASSEMBLY NOT FOR THE TIMID OR FOR THOSE WITH A LOW GARAGE CEILING,I was attracted to the idea of this device but assembly was difficult. There were numberous pieces and the instructions were not very helpful and in the end I needed to have my handyman complete the assembly and installation. The hoist works fine now except that it hangs so low to the ground that I feel that I need to lower my head walking under it.
4,It works,"Overall, a very good product. The instructions leave out a very important step. You need to determine which side you want the crank to be on, before you secure anything to the ceiling. I found that the two ends aren't interchangeable, so I had the wrong side facing out from the wall.Besides that, it wasn't too hard to assemble, and it works as advertised."
3,Works great once you install it,"I read several comments on the difficulty of installing this lift, I am usually very handy and don't have a difficult time installing products. However, the first unit I put together was a pain, the bars that attach to the wire framing with j-bolts is a terrible design as the bar wants to twist over the frame. It took me a few tries to get it together, putting the second lift together took no time. Also, I was not able to mount directly to my joists I had to mount 2x4's accross my joists and then attach the lift. Once installed these lifts are great, easy to lift up and down."
4,up and in place,Very satisfied. It been up now for a couple weeks.The instructions could be a little better but the product is sturdy and is working fine.
4,"Once installed, it works great!","Once installed, this storage rack works great. The directions are not as clear as they could be. When installing I dropped a piece and the only pastic part of the whole rack shattered. I emailed customer service and I received a replacement part 2 days later so I would give customer service 5 stars. Overall, I am pleased with the rack, but it took about 3 hours for me to install due to the lack of clarity in the instructions. Now that I have done it once, I could probably install another one in about an hour."
3,Better engineering needed,"I bought this thinking it would solve my garage storage needs. The engineering is terrible on this and many things need to be worked to install it. 3/16 inch diameter lags, two inches long are provided to secure it to the ceiling, but since by code, a garage needs at least 1 inch of sheetrock (mine has 1 1/4 inches) you will need to go out and buy 3 inch long lags to do the job safely...of course 3/16 inch diameter lags are rare, so now you will have to drill the holes bigger to accomodate a 1/4 inch diameter lag. If you don't install it securely, expect it to fall eventually. In other areas the parts are out of alignment and require modification and much effort to get them together. Also, plan on installation taking several hours due to the problems you will encounter. My recomendation is to skip this unless you are very handy and have a lot of tools and know how to get the job done right....too much to lose if it falls on somebody from poor installation."
3,Hard to install,"Took a professional handyman several hours to install this and he complained of the poor design and lack of adequate instructions. It's up and functioning now, but if I had to do it over I would not purchase this item. Frustrating installation."
3,"Great concept, cheap hardware","The concept is great, but the hardware to the storage rack and railings are a bit cheap. It was a 2-3 person job to put this together. The rack cables only come down 10 feet, so for garages with high ceilings it doesn't come completely to the floor. Once the rack has been put up it is great to have items up and out of the way, but highly recommend buying bigger and longer bolts than what come in the package."
5,Works like a charm!,"Shipping from Amazon is always TOPS ! Purchased the Racor ceiling storage unit. Followed the written instructions, watched the YouTube video and working alone (I am 63) found the storage unit relatively EZ to install. All parts needed were included in the parts box and all fit exactly as they should. I give the product 5 stars."
1,Buy this Lift and Risk your Life - One failure is one too many.,"I purchased and installed the Racor Heavy Lift according to instructions, except I bought new lag bolts as recommended by some users. I used the lift to store a Harmar trailer hitch scooter carrier #A300, which weighs 105 lbs. I figured this was OK, since the Racor is rated at 250 lbs. Less than six months after installing the Racor and hoisting up my scooter carrier for storage, all four cables broke and the lift and scooter carrier dropped to the garage floor, narrowly missing a family member and the hood of my new Subaru Outback."
3,The Good and the bad,"This item was received promptly when ordered. Directions were clear. Make sure you have a METRIC tool kit, all bolts are metric. Box was missing one hardware kit, which presented a problem to find metric sized bolts, (shaft is pre-threaded in metric size) Pre drilled bolt holes in the middle of the two piece winding shaft did not line up. Had to take to my workshop and re-drill on drill press. Other than these deficiencies in packaging and manufacturing the unit works fine. Can be operated with a cordless drill or by hand. I would not hesitate to buy another."
2,Under engineered for 250#,"I really like the idea and it will work for LIGHT loads. I just finished installing this product and found it to be under engineered to lift 250# as advertised. It seems to work reasonably well if the load is kept under 200#. The ceiling arms, cable, and platform seem to be okay, but the roller mechanism, particularly the roller gearbox and support are too light weight and try to twist with a full load. The gearbox ratio is such that it would be extremely difficult to crank it up with anything other than a very light load. I used a 1/2 drill as mentioned in the instructions, but you had to be very careful that the hook didn't ride up and bind. When this happened the lightweight rod used for the crank bent and I had to straighten it out (three times) and was lucky that I didn't sprain my wrist. If you use a drill, make sure you pull down on it while winding it up to keep the hook in place and do it in short bursts (not continuous) to keep it from riding up and binding."
3,wish the cabels were longer,i used it store ladders and it works greati have 11 ft ceiling in my garage and the cabel only lower the rack down to about 4 feet from the floor.
4,Very useful when storage space is minimal.,"Great product works very well (Although cranking up or down is very slow). After three lag screws provided with the product snapped (Used for securing the entire rack to the ceiling joists), I decided to purchase some stronger ones. Finding replacements was a little difficult due to the unusual size of the screws. With those two minor exceptions, I am very happy with the storage lift and plan on buying another."
3,review of Racor PHL-1R,"The system is adequate and meets my need. The package came damaged from shipping on the outside, but not hurt inside. The assembly was doable but tedious. The worst thing was lack of lockwashers for key fasteners and the stripped threads on the cable clamps. Several places tightening machine screws lead to crushing structural parts. The design is very good, but materials are not sufficient. I would not buy it again, but won't go to the headache of returning this either."
2,Just Not Well Made,"I bought this lift to store my kayak overhead in my garage. The directions were not easy to follow. The photographs really lacked perspective. If it were not for the on-line videos, I would have returned it, and doubt another product. The metal hooks used to hold the frame elements together were of poor quality metal and not consistently shaped. These quality issues with the hooks made it very difficult to get the platform shelf square and level, even with the almost 3/4"" of adjustability in length of the suspension bolts. Even after several attempts to square up the platform and adjust the length of the suspension wires, I was unable to get the platform square and level. That said, I was able to place my kayak on the platform and raise it into a reasonably stable position. Given all the time, effort and frustration to only reach a marginal storage position, this product is simply not worth the cost. I would not recommend or purchase it again."
3,Does what it says with a few problems,"This is a good product overall but I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before I purchased. It is true, the assembly instructions are pretty bad. I'm not sure why this company let some high school dropouts write the instructions, but they did. As others have noted, there are some modifications required. My problem with this unit was the platform attachments. I ended up buying some U bolts from the hardware store from keeping those awful J-hooks from rotating the platform support."
5,Works Great!,This storage lift works exactly as advertised. This is a great way to clear up some floor space by storing seasonal items up off the floor in the garage. I'm pushing the limits of the weight capacity with all of my ice fishing gear and still didn't have any issue using my cordless drill to wind it up to the ceiling.
4,built to specs?,"I've read through some reviews and I seem to be the only buyer with short cables. after installation the platform only lowers 7 feet from the ceiling, not the advertised 8 feet. with 11 foot ceilings this means loading at chest lever rather than waist level.Racor says they will send new cables, hopefully longer versions.I also had to drill out a wider hole on the cross bar for the J screws to fit and hold down the loading platforms.good product idea, but as other posts have mentioned, be prepared to make a trip for better lag screws and other hardware."
4,Racor Pro HeavyLift Storage Rack,"I have a fold up 4x8 utility trailer that's stored in the up right position. The space required to keep it in the garage wasn't too large an area, but I did cost wall space I needed. Since the lift capacity is well within the trailers weight, it looked like a good idea to get it off the gound and out of the way. It worked out perfect for gaining floor space. The only problem I have is the cranking force required to lift the trailer. With a couple of breaks between cranks I manage to get it up and out of the way. Well worth the purchase"
3,"Good product, but . . .","This is a good method for getting stuff off of your garage floor. I have two of them.The assembly instructions are awful. See other reviews for the best way to assemble this product. Start by throwing away the flimsy bolts included in the package.It would be nice if the platform went all the way to the floor, but it doesn't."
4,Great idea but could be built better......,"I bought two of these and like other reviewers, I too experienced poor hardware. Some of the J bolts were not long enough so I ended up designing and building my own floor platform out of 2X4s and plywood. I did use the metal beams to support the wood floor but I pitched the wire floor pieces. The end result was a much stronger platform with only 20 lbs additional weight. So far I have not experienced any trouble with the upper support unit but I will be keeping a close watch especially after reading Paul Cama's review. All in all I am satisfied with the outcome."
4,Really nice idea and almost a great product,"Great idea, but without reading other reviews this would have been a pain to install. Tha biggest flaw are the lag screws to attach the lift frame to the rafters, the ones that come with it are useless. The second item is the instructions, I think a few pix of an installed unit would clear up a lot. Unit works great and I'll purchase another in the fall when the summer junk must disappear."
4,Installation is not a breeze.,"I bought 3 of these, my friends and neighbors bought 5 after seeing mine. I am lucky to have a neighbor who can do anything and he installed all of the units. With every unit, there were different problems and runs to Home Depot. But he handled everything and the convenience of these lifts is incredible. I have 12 foot ceilings and find no issue with loading them. These have cleaned out some closets. Great products, but cheap parts."
4,Storage Rack,"The storage unit was exactly as advertised, fairly easy to assemble and attach to the garage ceiling. However, the lag bolts intended to secure the assembly to the ceiling were ""soft,"" made of poor quality steel and I had to replace them because the heads twisted off in the joists even with a pilot hole drilled. Also, the lifting mechanism (gear box) worm screw was stripped and as a result it was impossible to crank the storage up or down. This may have been a returned unit to the retailer given the condition of the box upon arrival. I contacted the original equipment manufacturer and they replaced the gear box without cost within a week. The lift is now installed and works as advertised - albeit the 4 star rating comes from all the self help required completing the task."
4,I HAVE A QUESTION BUT DON'T KNOW WHO TO ASK!,"WELL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PRODUCT, AND I AM NOT A PRO AT INSTALLING THINGS BUT, DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION ""CAN IT BE MOUNTED ON THE RAFTERS OF THE GARAGE IF THEY ARE SLANTED? AND WILL THE RACK THEN BE LEVEL TO HOLD STUFF? I DON'T KNOW IF THE CABLES ARE SELF-LEVELING OR NOT. HELP/ RUSSRacor Pro HeavyLift 4-by-4-Foot Cable-Lifted Storage Rack #PHL-1R"
5,Very Nice,"It's an awsome idea - to be able to access your junk without always tripping over it. The unit was easy to install, had clear directions and worked just like it should. The unit raised and lowered easily. Even gave the kids a ride. After we loaded it full junk it was a little harder to crank, but the pully and cord system still functioned perfectly.I can't speak about furtur performance, but after installation and a few uses - I love it!!"
4,Racor Cable Storage Rach,"If you have a small garage, or just need something to help get storage 'stuff' out of the way, the Racor is a great investment. Take your time to follow the instructions and you will have a great experience. I did this one by myself (it recommends two), which slowed things down a bit. I'm thrilled!"
4,I like it!,"This storage rack is great for my garage, however, it took a long time to put together. It works great and for a single woman to have it on cable's is perfect but it takes a lot of strength to use the crank. I purchased two but only had room for one. The dimesions are wider than 4x4 because of the crank pulley system. A friend purchased the other one so I didn't have to send it back..yeah! So far it's working out perfectly."
5,racor heavy lift,I think it is a very nice product to have and every bit what the manufacturer said it was.
4,Overhead storage rack,"Racor Pro HeavyLift 4-by-4-Foot Cable-Lifted Storage Rack #PHL-1RThe lift works very well and as advertised. All the hardware pieces were in the box. Assembly was relatively easy, but the directions were not as clear as they should have been. It took a few tries before everything went together. Overall, I'm well pleased with this sturdy product."
4,Super Project!,"I cannot remember how many albums Mars Lasar had already released.But I will say every cd is perfect. In this newest one,I can even find out some samples which are similar to Enigma.And there are a lot better! Surely it is a New Age album.That is for the fan of Enigma,Enya and so on. I highly recommend you the check it out!"
5,Apropos,"How apropos is this title, in keep with current affairs! The music is equally moving and transpots the listener to a better place."
3,Mars Lasar!,"I'm a big fan of Mars Lasar, but for my likes this album does not rate as high as his other Eleventh Hour releases."
4,Dust masks seem fine - got in case of emergency.,I can't believe they tell me how much I have to write. This is kinda of ridiculous. Stuff is fine.
1,Bad product,"This product is worthless. The masks are too small to cover your nose and mouth, unless you are a child. I used one and tossed the rest. The price should have warned me!"
5,Superior Quality,"These dust masks are not the el cheapo kind that you buy from the dollar store. They are thicker, stronger and more durable. All for a great price. You will not be disappointed."
3,Good for a disaster kit,"Admittedly, I don't have a wide range of experience with dust masks, but I needed some masks for my work disaster kit and the price was right with these ones. Heck, with a box of 50, I was able to share with my co-workers and have extras for my home disaster kit. Having tried one of them on, I wouldn't argue they are the world's most comfortable masks for daily use, but with the included nose clip and fairly thick filter, you could do worse than these in an emergency."
2,nice color footage..too bad the History Channel narrated it,"For the price of these documentaries,,,the color footage is definitely worth 5 stars.(if you pay under 7 dollars).The quality of the color footage is very very good..and not seen in other documentaries I have seen (I have seen most of the ones on Amazon).HOWEVER.... the History Channel takes the footage and mixes it with its USUAL propaganda and more propaganda stories than talking obectively about WW2. and what happened in the war. so much of the time you will be watching a propaganda story and footage associated with it..and not hearing about the stages of the war.nice if turn the sound down and just watch what there is interesting only."
3,IT's ok and it has closed caption,Good enough for some WWII info and best of all it is closed captioned. I have many other older WWII documentaries and most are not closed captioned. Big deal it my world. This was one of the main reasons I bought this DVD.
3,Varying quality,"A good overall look at the available color footage during the war. The commentary is quite good as well. Unfortunately, much of the footage is not as good as it could be. The first program on the first disc has a disappointing black level, and as a result, much of the footage looks too bright and washed out. While the next two programs improve on this, other DVDs such as ""The Third Reich in Color"" have presented color European theatre and Third Reich footage more carefully. However, none can compete all at once with this two disc set.The color footage shot during actual battles and preperation for D-Day are high points, as well as the seven minutes or so of Eva Braun home movies on the end of the disc. Pacific theatre buffs will feel shortchanged; I'd say 80 to 85% of the material concerns Europe. This DVD set is certainly worthwhile if you wish to see a large quantity of period color footage with informative commentary. It succeeds in bringing the war and the period to life."
3,Excellent recording...if transcriptions appeal to you,"With all the new and exciting contemporary works that the LA Phil is presenting (not to mention the rethinking of some of the ""old masters"") I wonder why Salonen elected to put this selection on disc. The orchestra plays beautifully, the sound is elegant, but there is something that aproaches pedantic about this. Perhaps Salonen wants to exercise some of the influences on his own composing. Or perhaps this is an homage to the old tradition of creating various arrangements of well known music for a variety of ensembles. It is valuable as a curiosity, but it is doubtful that it will be one of your frequently played recordings. Why not Stucky or Lieberson or Reich or even the Gorecki 2nd Symphony instead.......?"
3,Oddly dispirited and square,"These lushly romantic, even shmaltzy arrangements of Bach for orchestra--the kind made famous by Stokowski when conducting was a glamorous Hollywood profession--don't suit Salonen at all. By temperament he is all but anti-romantic, a modernist through and through. So these performances, despite being well played and in gorgeous sound, are lifeless. Stick with Stokowski all the way."
5,A classic text for anyone interested in acoustic phonetics,"This is not really a review. Can anyone help me get copies of this book that appears to be out of print. There are few books that are its equal, and although I include it on my reading lists, so far I have not found an easy way to access the text for my graduate students at City University. Any assistance would be appreciated.Allen Hirson Snr Lecturer (Phonetics) City University, London, UK"
4,Among the Greatest ... Ever,"This reissue captures Allen Toussaint's mid-period solo recordings including several must-have tracks such as ""Workin' in a Coal Mine,"" ""Sweet Touch of Love,"" ""Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky"" and the title track. For the most part, Toussaint wrote these tunes for other artists, notably Lee Dorsey whose takes are the definitive vocal recordings. But there's something magical about Toussaint's vocal delivery. It's so smooth and mellow, yet intense, soulful and funky. There's nothing quite like hearing the composer sing his own songs. Toussaint's later solo recording are captured in the Complete Warner Bros. Recordings set, which is also very much worth getting."
5,i love it!,"i love it when nicky and tare say the ghouls in max's house stuck themselves to their faces and tried to smother them with their big, blobby bodies! But the gouls are really nicky and tare the whole time!"
3,Theraputic Value,I am an Alcohol and Drug Counselor and use this as a metaphor for the second step. Clients read the story as a group and then create their own representative depiction of the walls they created that separated them from others and society threw their use. The story is not that great but serves its purpose.
5,Wonderful book.,"The Wall is a thought provoking book that talks about every person, & the problems we face when we choose to build walls to keep others out of our lives. I read this book years ago & never forgot its lesson. I was so happy to find it again on Amazon."
5,Brilliant!,"I have yet to realize words can be such powerful stimulants until reading this book. No matter how strong my defense, they seem to wriggle its way through to my heart hitting right on spot. I had to have a box of tissue ready before diving in every time. Its remarkable!!!"
2,Fair overview with terrible narration,"This is a one-hour documentary about US Navy carriers since their inception after World War 1. It covers most of the important historical aspects of carrier aviation in the US Navy, and if you aren't very familiar with our Navy it is a fair overview to start with. The narration, however, is awful. Why produce a documentary like this and not bother to get a professional voice-over? It seriously hurts the effort overall."
4,Mystery and Romance,This is not your typical boy meets girl romance. There's so much more going on behind the scenes than anyone on the bluff ever imagined. Ms. Bowman keeps you on your toes and I found myself holding my breath wondering if Abigail would be safe or not and if Ethan was too good to be true. You'll have to read it to find out if Abigail is the one to take on the challenge of The House on the Bluff
1,Didn't even make it through the first chapter,"Normally I sample a book from a new author before deciding to buy, but with all the strong positive reviews and a price of just over $4 I didn't think I could go wrong. I won't make that mistake again.I thought this book was horribly written -- from incorrect punctuation use in the prologue to changes in person in the first chapter from third to first and back again within a single paragraph with no qualification. Mid-way through the first chapter I decided not to continue... there's just too many books waiting to be read to continue with one that is so aggravating!"
2,Might work but not worth the money and no lambswool,I couldn't believe my eyes when I opened the package and found this duster - the selling price was high for the quality but what really got me was the shipping fee which put this dollar store reject over $6.30! No way - a penny swindle or a dollar swindle is too much swindling ....and the seller should be ashamed for selling this cheap plastic and dyed feather duster at more than $1.00 and then charging $5.28 for shipping. NO lambswool that I can see in this product. I can say the color is pretty but I would not display it due to the cheap materials and construction.
3,Rope fibers easily unraveled.,"My puppy does love fetching and tugging this toy, but the fibers in the rope are just too fine for aggressive chewers with small teeth. The tiny fibers have pulled out in loops that get caught in her mouth during play. This does not feel like a safe or durable you, which is surprising because of the brand."
3,Make sure you pay attention to the size!,"I got this, it is x-small. I love Kong's brand. I have a puppy Boston Terrier, He's around 7 months old. This is a little TOO small for him. He can still play with it and still loves it however he did break it in 1 hour of playing with it. He broke the kong part and untied the ropes. It's decent, just I would probably get it for not a puppy with high toy drive."
3,"Cute, but my dog has no interest in this","My yorkie loves playing tug of war with his toys so I thought he would really like this. However, he has paid no attention to this what so ever since I received it and took it out of the box. I've tried to coax him into playing with it but he really has no interest. I'm planning to donate it to an animal shelter and hopefully another dog will enjoy it."
1,Very poor,This thing was so cheap was playing with it with my dog for 5mins and it broke. Will never buy again
5,Fun,This was well done and fun. We are giving it to our Dad for Christmas. He will love it.Many familiar sights and lots of history and pictures to go with.
5,Terrific!,"Ever since I heard about this series, I knew I had to get it. Now it's my most beloved collection. The stories are different, very interesting, the characters are fun, funny, and deep, and it's torture waiting for each volume to come out. Sure, it's not really quite yaoi (although there are insinuations and some situations), but even despite that it is a terrific read!! It's got to be my all time favorite manga series! Did I mention how hot the characters are? ... No? Well they ARE. The art is just absolutely beautiful, as well. Try a volume, you'll love it!"
5,Beautiful photography.,"I don't cook, nor do I have any desire to do so, but I LOVE this DVD, and I miss the TV show. It's excellent, the visuals are perfection, very calming and relaxing to watch! Only Martha and her team could make something so simple like beating an egg so visually stunning."
4,Tough to swallow but interesting none the less,"Being an AP biology high school student, I found some of the material in Matt Ridley's book somewhat hard to comprehend. However, the theories and the solutions he presents intrigued me. If he can interest a 16 year old skeptic, then bravo!!"
5,The perfect laxative for every politically correct busy-body,"This is an extraordinary account of why we, humans, are as we are. Ridley develops a conclusive argument for how genetic and evolutionary influences moulds our reality. He demolishes the foundations of those who claim that the ""evils"" of society are the causes and drivers of human behaviour.Ridley also shows that the differences between women and men are rooted in in-born features rather than as a consequence of patriarcal societies. This in no way justifies gender inequality. The key point here is that the social engineering agenda of bureaucrats is essentially flawed because our nature dictates the way we are.Overall, a great read for free-thinkers and free-spirits."
3,"Intriguing title, rambling voice.","Used for my Human Sexual Behavior Class. Interesting ideas but ultimately drags on. I only had to read a few chapters for class so it wasn't extended suffering. And when the year was finished, I found myself not wanting to sell it back. One of the few texts from college I'll keep."
3,Subject Matter Interesting; Delivery not so much,"Perhaps I had expectations for this book which were not met. Still, I was hoping for a more readable book and ended up trying to decipher his dry style. Although there were some interesting points made, his conjectures were hit and miss and I couldn't make it all the way through the book. Not a good to read for a layman."
5,Excellent,"A very detailed and comprehensive study of sex and the evolution of human nature. The average rating of the book is accurate.Not a criticism, but there were two areas that I was interested in but were not covered; how our senses (see, hear, smell, touch , taste) may contribute to choosing our partners, especially smell. Secondly, the appeal to women of men that are humourous. Wealth, age, height, healthy looking bodies, intellect etc are all 'obvious' appeals that are well documented in the book, though I have always been curious as to why some/many women are attracted to men that make them laugh. Any thoughtful comments regarding this subject would be appreciated."
4,Great Book,"I can't add very much to the excellent reviews already posted. I'll just say quickly that I enjoyed very much the fresh insight into mating practices among the ""lower animals"" and among humans. I've read a lot about evolution and biology and so forth, and still found much new material here. I really enjoyed learning about how scientists finally discovered the rampant adultery among birds and how incredible they are at hiding it.Several reviewers warn about having to ""make it through"" the first part, and I certainly understand that if your primary interest is in the evolutionary origins of human sexuality. However, I really enjoyed the first part as well, because it provides a broad understanding of sex in evolution and give lots of fun examples about different behaviors and adaptations.Although I didn't give the book 5 stars (I reserve that for the best of the best), it showed me that Mr. Ridley is a great writer and I'll check out his other books (I think I'll start with Genome)."
5,Great Book,"The Red Queen is a great book overall. Writen very professionally, and clear for the most part. If you want to learn about evolution and where we come from, you have found the right book. Love the analysis and the different concepts. This book opened my mind to things and concepts I had no idea about. Although I feel like it's a long read; atleast its filled with rich content, worth reading. Overall I enjoyed reading this book, and recommend it to anyone interested in the subject."
2,"important topic, but confusing exposition","I wanted to enjoy this book, as the subject matter is fascinating, but the author's writing style is confusing to the point of opacity. Different scientific theories are either given bizarre names, like ""tangled bank"", or attached to the names of the originating scientists. Tangential metaphors, or even poems, are thrown about willy-nilly. I became so confused trying to figure out what was what, and who was who, that I gave up about halfway through the book. For truly excellent expositions on developmental biology -- lucid, informative, and entertaining -- you cannot do better than the books by Dawkins."
5,A great book on human evolution,"I read this book after having read 20+ books on evolution, human evolution, and primate evolution. I was extremely impressed and pleased with it. I talk about it often and it changed my view of the subject."
2,"Great subject matter, though difficult to read at first","When I first got this book, it was very difficult for me to get through the first couple of chapters, which are very technical and deal with the most fundamental question of how organisms and sex emerged. So I skipped ahead a few chapters and started reading about the more specific human behaviors, much easier to digest.These days, I actually enjoy the first part of the book more. I went back and re-read his discussion of pre-historic times, and surprisingly that part is much more authoritative than his observations of contemporary human mating (which are better summarized by other scientists)."
2,Interesting but convoluted,"I was disappointed with this book. While the primary thesis was indeed interesting, the book might better have been summarized in an article. The author clearly tried to cover too many areas of the evolution of sexual differences and consequently diluted the substance of his argument. The 2 stars might seem harsh but the other ratings of 5 stars were WAY too generous."
2,Prepare for offence,"Ridley's conjecture and supposition swirling about the knowledge are deeply offensive to me. I guess that is what drew my interest, how much more can this author offend a human being, especially to those that are male, which is the focus of Ridley's writing, maybe because he would be unpopular if he tackled the other sex. Apologies made to those that are female, why? I can only guess that western society, political correctness etc have shaped the lens through which the author sees the world. Still, I was interested in what he had to say, I received something like a punch in the face. Indeed I'm flummoxed as to why other readers haven't expressed opinions of disgust."
3,Too serious / intense - Not for casual reading,This is interesting only if you want to do a very detailed study on Sex and Evolution of Human Nature. Not something I would recommend if you are just looking for some dating techniques or How to....type suggestions.
4,This is a great song but BUY THE ALBUM.,"Trust me, you'd much rather buy the album than the single. The album is really good. It has one song called ""Independent Lady"" and its not only features Lil Zane rapping on. But it's also featuring Teddy Riley of Blackstreet. I really like the song. I think all three of them work really well together. I also really love the songs ""Stupid (Nothing I Believe)"", ""I Adore"", and ""Big Things"". Those are just my very, very favorites. The whole album is wonderful. Now I'm going to go listen to it. So you know what I'm going to tell you again. DON'T GET THE SINGLE. GET THE ALBUM."
3,Cute but not easy to stick to wall...,"1. Why on earth do they fold the border and not roll it?! Before installing, unpack the border to flatten the folds. You may need to let it sit out for a few days. Otherwise, you will see the folds on the wall.2. The sticky back does not stick to the wall at all. We used elmers glue. I'm pretty sure I will regret this once I want to take the border off but it looks good now!All in all, very cute border but you need to add some TLC to get it looking/sticking nicely."
1,Falls off,Unfortunately this border didn't stick to our walls. It immediately fell off no matter what we did. Too bad because it matched the rest of the room perfectly. Maybe it's because our walls have glossy paint?
1,Horrible border! (Blue Camo),This was the worst border I've ever used. Two adults trying and we still could not get it to stick. The prepasted back never even got tacky. My little boy was crying- it was just awful! Save your money!
2,Low Compatibility,"I chose to return this item before putting it in service because I discovered too late the disc compatibility issue: it requires ""digital audio only"" CDs, which are in more limited supply than other all purpose types. Plus, I had purchased a disc printer and needed to use white face discs compatible with thermal printing. Trying to find digital audio only discs with white thermal printing capability was enough to kill the deal. I realized I had to move up to a professional grade unit, and so I chose the Tascam CD-RW750. At slightly less than twice the price, it is more than worth it."
2,Familiar but I'm on my 4th one,"I'm on my 4th one, mostly because it's so familiar to me and I have a hard time finding a similarly-priced unit that will do the same thing. BUT MAINLY BECAUSE I HAVE TO KEEP TAKING IT BACK UNDER WARRANTY!!!!!! Do NOT buy this unit without the extended warranty, it WILL give out on you."
1,Sont RCDW Compact disc player/recorder,"This piece of equipment is just awful! Ive yet to record anything, Its just to complicated for what I'm asking it to do sadely it has a 5 disc cd changer that sounds like it was first concieved when Japan was a part of the Axis, and why not just make a machine that just records one cd to a blank cd I guess that they tried to capture both markets in one machine I should be able to put a cd in one side and a blank in the other and hit record and actually have it record. Sadely I never recieved a degree in electrical engineering so maybe this is the problem! Im not the kind of guy that has the patience for this back and forth stuff so as of tomorrow it will be fair game for the ""Dumpster Divers"" Jim Copeland Delray Beach Florida"
1,Absolute Junk-buyer beware,"I have had this unit (well, not this particular unit since it's already been returned twice)for a little over a year and IT STINKS. The first unit I had just stopped recording cdr's after about 15minutes. I returned it to Sony(that's right-no returning to the store) and they sent me a ""reconditioned"" unit. The reconditioned recorder worked fine-it just wouldn't play any cd's. Back to Sony it went. My brand spanking new ""reconditioned"" pile of waste won't play cd's nor will it release them once you get the door to open. Sony should be ashamed of this garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT UNLESS YOU WANT A WORLD OF ANNOYANCE."
4,Sony RDCW500C CD Player/Recorder,"Nice as a 5 CD changer. OK as a recorder. I wanted this to convert 33 RPM Records to CD's. Many times I need to use a separate CD for each side.--not covered in Manual of on-line FAQ's.The manual is a little weak. This is consumer electronics not computer hardware/software and more information, more easily understood, would help.The Changer is large (deep) and may not fit in some shelves. Not a problem for me and the construction is typical Sony; heavy and apparently well-constructed.When a 33 RPM is well-preserved, you get a nice recording. When there are scratches, dirt, etc., you get what yu created when you originally played the records. If the turntable does not have a pre-amp, you need to add one."
3,Technology has passed this by,"I reviewed this in 2004, but technology has changed enough in the meantime to make that review and, for most people, this product obsolete. What's new is: 1. you very likely have a computer with a CD burner and 2. a 1GB SD card (enough to hold a CD) costs under $20, making recording either direct to CD or to hard disk less attractive.These days, for transferring vinyl or cassette to CD or MP3, I would recommend something like theEdirol R-09 WAVE/MP3 Recorder. Plug it into your stereo to record, and then carry it (or its memory card) to your computer. Edit and mix to taste, then burn. Do not be put off by the fact that this device looks nothing like a stereo component; rather, put it in your pocket and record your kid's recital, in higher quality than you can imagine if the last time you tried was on cassette."
1,SHOULD COME WITH XANAX! DON'T BUY IT.,"This is the most aggravating piece of junk that I've ever bought. Although mine finalizes all right, mine finds new ways to aggravate. What happens with mine is that it will let you record half of a cd of songs from various cds, and then it will give you the ""TOC rec err"" or the C14 rec err message. What this means is that no player will play past that point when you try to play it. Unless your player has a ""Shuffle mode"" that will skip the gaping gap in the CD you're up the creek without a paddle. All of your time will have been wasted.I'll NEVER buy ANY SONY product again. Their customer service is non existant. Don't encourage them!"
4,Excellent for Digitizing Analog Music Library,"I purchased this CD recorder primarily for the purpose of converting my old and hard to find recordings to digital format and for that is works exceptionally well. I particularly like the fact that it automatically indexes the disc (installs track breaks) between songs for easier playback later. Of course you can do this manually before finalizing if you choose. Earlier reviews I read said this unit was hard to use but those reviewers must be too lazy to read the manual or lack the intuitive ability to grasp the easy formatting process. Just record your music then press ""finalize"" and confirm with ""yes"" what could be hard about that? - The 5 disc playback side of this unit works well but that's not what I bought it for."
1,A real piece of poo,"I just bought my recorder, and already found serious problems.1. It won't record from other components in stereo.2. When I try to record in high-speed synchro, I get error messages.Yeah, I've been ruining a bunch of CDs, which brings me to the less serious issue of having a hard time finding the digital audio CDs this unit requires, and when I did finally find them, found them to be about three times as expensive as the ones I was using on the Sony RCD-W3 I had to replace after using it for several years.The unit is slow, and yeah, the instruction book can be used as kindling. Only.I'm taking it back. I hope I can find a non-Sony unit online."
2,The worst cd recorder I ever owned!,"The Sony recorder is the worst I ever owned. When I first bought it after a week recorded cds would skip or not play.I sent it back for repair it was lost for three months.Now 15 months later the player is skipping and not playing disc.Get alot of no disc,when there is a disc in it.Before I bought the Sony. I had three JVC units never any problems other than I wore them out.When I went to purchase another one Jvc no longer made them. The sony was the only one I could find.I have never been a fan of Sony except for their portable items Walkmans ect. I'm now going with the Yamaha CDRHD1500 HDD its high price,but you get what you pay for. It also seems the home CDR recorders are becoming a thing of the past so if you plan on buying one you had better act fast.Get a good one,it might be the last one you can find."
1,don't buy this product!,"This is a total rip-off. I bought this unit because I didn't want the confusion of recording my own CDs from a computer. Was I mistaken -- big time. This is the most confusing unit I have ever worked with, and I still have not been able to figure out how to record my own CDs on this unit. Plus there is no customer support -- you call and get the usual run around via robotic messages.A total waste of money. Sony, you should be ashamed."
2,Sony used to be great,"I used to buy a lot of Sony gear because it was well made and reliable, not so much anymore. This unit worked til the warranty ran out then jammed with my media inside. I had to disassemble to retrieve it. Not very pleased to say the least. When it worked, it was fine, a tad hard to use."
3,Sony 5 Disc CD recorder,"The main recommendation for the Sony 5 disc CD recorder is the price. It is relatively easy to use and produces quality recordings. There is some issue w/ errors occuring but that could as well be defects in the blanks used? Haven't figured that out yet, but about one in 10 discs produce error codes that can't be fixed. These are more frequent when the machine gets older."
1,Sony RCDW500C,"I purchased this product on October 31, 2010. I never got the chance to use it until February 1, 2011. It worked fine on the first 20 discs I recorded. ( I was recording vinyl discs.) The unit then became operational intermittently, then finally quit altogether, around February 15. I was informed by Sony Service center to send it to the Sony Exchange to swap units with an operational one. (I had to pay another $191.41, to have the unit repaired, because I was unable to obtain a proof of purchase invoice), and the exchange center would not accept the packing invoice. The Sony Exchange Center did not have a replacement, so it was then sent to a Sony Service Center. I have received no information concerning repairs. I have always been a Sony promoter, but will NEVER buy Sony again."
1,Don't buy this recorder,"This recorder will frustrate the hell out of you. It is a piece of crap and you will waste hours trying to convert your LP's and Tapes to CD. It has a mind of its own, the push buttons on the recorder and remote buttons may or may not work. I can't count the hours wasted trying to get this thing to work properly. If you want to go ahead anyway, make sure you use CD-RW and not CD-R discs because you will need to erase frequently and start over. Very disappointed with Sony for dumping this piece of junk on the Consumer."
4,opinion,It's a shame you have a promotion for 30.00 that don't work. I have excellent credit I really did'nt need a credit card but I wanted to take advantage of the offer.Then Chase of all people denied my card. I have my home loan and other credit card with them and have never been late with a payment in all the years I've dealt with them. Plus when you fill out the application they tell you it could be 10 days before approve. I had to use my debit card to pay for my product then. That is a real bad promotion you have. I am still learning the product
1,Wish I could give 0 or - stars.,"This player/recorder is overpriced junk. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a computer cd burner. I suppose this is why the market doesn't really offer this kind of burner anymore. Junk, junk, junk!"
3,"It's OK,but....","It's ok for making exact copies ,but not for making your own mix.I bought one because my old PHILLIPS recorder, well it's old.Sony will burn at 4x and CD TEXT if it's on the CD.However, if your making a Road Mix or a Fav mix it will only burn at 1x and will not include CD Text;nor can you manually place CD Text while recording which I could do with Ol' Phillip. Ol' Phillip would included CD text and burn @ 2X 1 song at at time.If the CD wasn't text,you could do it manually while you were burning.I really expected alot more from a SONY. Oh, I almost forgot It will not Text 'TRACK ARTIST' only the name of the disc and the name of the song!I wish I knew that before I bought it, I'd would have gotten something else!"
1,Good player lousy CD recorder,I've had the unit about one year (purchased new). For about 9 months it played and recorded well. I had not used it for about 3 months then tried to record. Using music cd-rw discs which I had been using all along the unit will not recognize in input. It will recognize the disc and go into the record mode but it is not sensing any input. I know nothing last forever but 1 year is nuts.
1,sony rcdw recorder,well the instructions are so incomplete and bad I haven't figured out how to use it I wouldn't recommend it
1,DOA,"I ordered the Sony RCDW500C disc player recorder based on the extemely positive experiences I continue to have on Amazon, and it was the best price I could find on the internet. Unfortunately the unit arrived pretty much DOA. I wrote to Amazon and they gladly took the unit back and refunded the whole amount. Great job! I subsequently purchased a similar unit from a local electronics dealer. It is a great unit."
1,"Item may be fine, but customer service sucks","I ordered this as a christmas present and it turned out to be a duplicate. I emailed the company right away on the 26th....no response. As I type this, I am sitting on hold letting the phone ring and ring until someone answers.....44 minutes and counting. This shipped from Electronics Expo in New Jersey. I would not order this product again in a hundred lifetimes if this is the service I receive."
1,horrible,i hate mini disc and by the way people this is not from sony's quality days sony hasnt been good since 2002 get an old sony cassette deck for recording thats top notch it will work ten times better then this i guarentee i gave this a try and sent it back it wouldnt work for me at all
4,Room for everything,"I have yet to leave the house carrying this daiper bag wishing that something else would fit in it, though it is a little stiff at first and the compartment that is designed for Mom's stuff doesn't open quite as far as I would like...overall a good bag and it fits everything I need for my 16 month old...the changing pad is nice to have with such a small bag, it is an accessory that you might have to give up with other small diaper bags."
4,Good Info,"I thought this book contained good information and the drawings are incredible- although confusing at times. There are many steps described in this book, both advanced and beginner. I find this book a great addition to my ballet collection. As a dancer, it is a good reference book for me when I have a question or uncertainty about a step. This book describes in detail how to preform barre exercises, allegros, turns, pointe work, etc. This is a necessity for all dancers and dancer-wannabes."
5,Timeless Beauty Revisited,"This beautiful classic, repackaged by Alfred A. Knopf, will remain a treasured addition to the library of any lover of the ballet. Six hundred stunning illustrations, in 156 plates by Carlus Dyer bring life to the concepts."
2,Dated,"I knew this book would be dated (it was apparently published originally in 1949), but I thought it might have some good eye exercises and advice for tired eyes. I was told that I need to have vision training (or vision therapy), but since I cannot afford that right now, I went ahead and bought this book. What a waste. Basically, it recommends that you get more sunlight on your eyes, ""palm"" your eyes (basically, put your hands over your eyes and press lightly), and swing your body from side to side in the sun while palming (to relax your eyes). Maybe the other reviewers got something out of it that I did not, but I definitely would not recommend it."
4,Sharp & Crisp,"This is as sharp a picture as i have seen,and i am 69 years old,my wife and i love it.We use it in a small room, sound is good also.My other set is a 57"" Sony HD this one blows it away."
2,Not the best production available.,"Webber's rather slight musical needs the best possible talent to be successful. The gimmicky score and too precious lyrics can only be salvaged by energetic performances and this version does not have talent to support the play's faults. Jason Donovan is an adequate Joseph but seems to play the role so straight that the humanity in the character is lost. Linzi Hately's narrator is no match for others recorded in the role and David Easter's Pharoh has very little of The King in him. Not recorded with clarity, and with a rather bizarre club mix at the end, this version could be missed unless you want a keepsake for this particular production."
2,Not fair for Gloria,"While she was a fugitive, Gloria's record label, BMG, released this album that includes 2 previously unreleased tracks (""No soy monedita de oro"" and ""Que pasa en la azotea"") and remixed versions of some of her greatest hits. The truth is that the remixes are very bad and do not represent Gloria Trevi's work as a musician. She did not even have anything to do with this album, it was released by the record label taking advantage of her scandal. Gloria is a music genious, and if you want to have a taste of what her real music sounds like, stay away from this and get ""Ellas cantan asi"" or ""Recuento de los Danos"" instead."
5,One of Survivor's Best!,"Classic 80s CD that should not be passed over. ""Can't Hold Back"" is worth the price of the CD alone although the rest of the songs are great as well."
5,Outstanding release from Survivor !,An all American band and the best in it's genre !Survivor had a long string hits and this album only spawned more !I can't hold back and High on you are outstanding tunes !I love Survivor and thought every release was worth the money and I proudly own all of them now !
3,Back Arch is not much for the money,"Although cleverly designed, this back arch is very narrow and takes some getting used to. I think it would be a better value at half the price."
4,"Good exercise prop, but does not include recommended exercise examples","I have used this product for over a year. I like it, but wonder if the way I am using it is providing the maximum benefit. No recommended exercise examples are provided, as with several less expensive HUGGER MUGGER exercise props. I recommend including either a DVD or a large printed layout with pictures of exercise examples."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book was a waste. I purchase a 'programming' book to learn how to develop using a particular library, etc.This is a pocket guide to curses with a 5 line piece of code every once in a while.If it is new to you find something else.I looked at a Wrox ""Linux Programming"" book and found MUCH more thorough explanations and covering the same material! I guess I'll use that instead."
3,Somewhat disappointed with this book....,"While this book covers most of what you need to know, it would have been a great book if it gave the information in an orderly format. The only code is the spreadsheet (too simple) application at the end of the book. The documentation that came with sunos 4.1 is more comprehensive."
1,Bad Company to do business with.,"They go by Haus of Blankets, Gravity Trading and Solaron but it is the same company.... Review Title says it all."
2,You'd do better to purchase the items separately and avoid suction cups,"This travel laundry kit has been around for ages. I got one when I first traveled abroad a decade ago, and it turned out to be something of a nightmare. While seductive with its packets of Woolite, sink stopper, and clothesline, you'll quickly notice that the suction cups on the clothesline rarely stick to a surface and cannot support the considerable weight of wet hanging laundry.I'd recommend instead purchasing such elements separately. TheFlexolinelaundry line has long been preferred by people traveling light, and it's strong and stretchable enough for anything. Woolite packs can be bought on their own at greater number for less cost. The sink stopper, being a simple slab of rubber, can be had for pennies in a store near you. Avoid this kit."
3,son;s girlfriend,at the front of the page is $25.00 dlls and you go to the item is 40.00dllplease can you tell me . whats the price ?thank you
3,"Good story, but bad kindle edition","This is a great American classic story, but get a kindle edition that is better formatted and has illustrations. I recommend this:The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Illustrated)"
3,Rare But Disappointing,"While it is always a treat for diehard Ella fans to get new live material on CD, this one just misses the mark. The producer reveals in his album notes that he feels this is some of Ella's best work. While these are indeed rareties, both the sound quality and the song selection are sub-par. I must admit to a prejudice: he also speaks poorly of the biographies written about Ella, and I am one of the authors in question. However, Ella's live repertoire at this point in her career was varied, and there are some wonderful recordings available of her work from this time. But with the scratchyness of acetate recordings from middle-of-the night radio shows where Ella is tired and hoarse, there could easily have been a better collection than this. A must for the die-hard; the rest of you should get any of her legendary live albums."
3,Half-baked,"Rev. Splinter has a good idea of the larger steps of divorce recovery, but he fails to grasp the finer details of the process. He follows the general (sexist) stereotypes of the 70's generation of divorces, where the woman is uneducated and ""helpless"", and the man is ""unable"" to express or deal with his emotions. Splinter's observations of various personality types seems rather old and stereotyped as well, and his approach can be heavy handed. Perhaps you might read this book at a general guide, more ""food for thought"" than a ""complete"" recovery handbook.I have taken Mr Splinter's workshops in St Louis, and like them much better than his book. They wonderfully combine the guidance of the leaders with individual expression, and the groups are always packed full. I highly recommend them."
1,Complete Divorce Recovery Handbook,The book a lot of talk but not any real long lasting answers. It was not practical in its approach for my situation. I found Larry Crabb to be far more helpful as his books gave me more Spiritual centerness in his writings and it pointed in a direction where we could find strength and answers beyond ourselves in terrible times of turmoil.
5,Spiritual without being heavy-handed,"I read and reread this book several times after my divorce in 1998. At each stage of divorce recovery, the book had something new to say. The questions in each chapter made me reflect upon the part I played in the marriage failure, a painful but necessary step in healing. Each chapter also contained Biblical references that I found sometimes confronting and sometimes comforting, but also relevant. The author is especially persuasive in presenting ways to help your kids through divorce. I always recommend this book to my Christian friends who are hurting from the devastation of divorce."
5,more,"waits can tell a longer story in a line or two -- just listen to him howl ""my parole officer would be proud of me/i've got an Olds 88 and the devil on a leash"" on ""goin' out west"" -- than other fine songwriters can pack into a whole tune. ""i don't wanna grow up"" is far from joyful... it is among the nuggets of heartbreak that make this lp so extremely effective and moving. it's clear from listening to the whole thing that waits has more in common with cormac mccarthy than angsty folksingers. each track is a unique, beautiful, evocative story of complex mixtures of sorrow, desperation, and loss -- but never would waits ever dip into any easy, syrupy sentimentality. perhaps the most important thing about the songs is how each is different, rather than how they are similiar. there's a distinct mood, from outrageously defiant brashness to tender soft heartbreak... but each is such a complete literary piece that there is never any threat of monotony."
2,REALLY TOO OVERRATED,I really can't understand why everyone hails this album as one of his best..it's really a tuneless piece of noise...i haven't bought any of the other albums he's recorded after this one cause they all sound the same from what i reckon!Best work:Blue Valentine and Swordfishtrombones
5,Sublime,"This is the album that made me a devout fan. You may have to listen to it twice to feel it, but i guarantee it's worth it. Music will never be the same after this."
4,Difficult listening hour,"Top Waits music is like no other. One must fully listen to understand. This album, as such, is not to be played in the background. Get yourself a bottle of burbon and hunker down.Seldom do I have the opportunity to open this album. Though it is a masterpiece, it deserves respect, and can not be taken lightly.If you are new to Mr. Waits, then this is probably not the album to get started with. Go out and buy something from the 70's like ""Closing Time"", ""Small Change"", or ""Blue Valentine"" as they are probably the most listenable. You could even play them with dinner - though that's kind of a shame. When you are ready for a step further, go get ""Swordfishtrombone"" or ""Frank's Wild Years"". If you're still alive after all this, then it's time for ""Bone Machine""."
5,Excellent Album,"This album is fascinating. This seems to be a continuation of his famous trilogy. I really love this album and fall more in love with it each day. Keith Richards returns to do a song which is a great highlight. Also one of the hits from the record would later be covered by The Ramones. Thats how good a songwriter Tom Waits is. Favorites include Dirt in the Ground, Who Are You, Jesus Gonna Be Here, Little Rain (For Clyde), Goin' Out West, Murder in the Red Barn, Black Wings, I Don't Wanna Grow Up (The Ramones would later cover), and That Feel (cowritten and with Keith Richards). Pick this great album up. Highly Highly Recommended"
4,A MEMORABLE ORIENTAL FRAGRANCE,"Hanae Mori has come a long way from her birth in rural Shimane, Japan. She is now a world reknowned designer dividing her time between Paris and Japan. Departing from clothing she introduced this scent, a unique blend of aromas, some ten years ago.Highlighted by flowers and berries there are also notes of strawberries and almond.The lovely bottle has a top modeled of glass to represent the folded wings of a butterfly. This fragrance is suitable for all occasions."
4,ES UN BUEN `PERFUME,"ES CITRICO, EN ALGUNAS CHICAS QUEDA MUY BIEN, EN OTRAS NO MUCHO, DEPENDE DE LA QUIMICA, PERO ES BUENO SI TE QUEDA"
3,wrong boot,"The boots fit ok, but they sent the wrong one and the return policy is so difficult, I just kept them."
4,Prophesy Book,"Great book. This book contains a lot of valid, accurate, truthful, helpful information. I recommend this book for our modern times."
5,The Ultimate Spiritual Companion,"This is book is amazing! My mind was blown when I read it. Contained within these 600 pages is a wealth of wisdom, knowledge and relevant information. It's not just a dictionary, it's a tool. It helps me most to understand what my dreams mean, and is a valuable resource for understanding spiritual things. Paula Price is a brilliant author. I immensely enjoyed her last book the Church Prophets and they keep getting better ever time."
5,Great resource tool.,"I consider the Prophet's dictionary an invaluable tool in my Bible study time. I use it to help prepare for sermons and writing lesson plans. I highly recommend it to every one that reads the Bible! I praise God for Dr. Paula Price, and for her obedience in creating a tool to help us uderstand the mind of God."
2,Handle with Caution,"This book seemed exciting to obtain because it appeared comprehensive. Well, it is, but at what cost? This contains questionable extra-Biblical information. At the same time, I couldn't find a few references in that thick book that I was certain would have been in there. I have to know that I can rely on truthful, accurate, information derived from the Bible, lest I risk contamination. My own mentor had even stronger objections about the information displayed. I had to return the book."
4,Easy Resource,This is great for a quick and easy resource. Helps gets a person started if wanting to research.
3,"Very good, but I expected even more","Very interesting book, the kind it's good to have it always at hand if you are interested in the prophetic, supernatural ministry and ancient spiritual seductions. I found many things I really didn't know even after 20 yrs+ of being aroung churches and crhstian ministries believing in the prophetic. However I was expecting a more practical approach and I'm not always 100% confortable with some statements. I mean, this is full of interesting subjects but some of the things I expected to be in a prophetic dictionary are not there or very shortly addressed, while other words I thought not really essential for a dictionary like this are included, sometimes stating the obvious. Overall a very good book, but not as excellent as I had thought by reading other reviews..."
5,Outstanding Book!!,"This is one of the most comprehensive and detailed book I have read on the Prophetic in a long time. It gives a thorough introduction to each subject and provides scriptural references throughout. I have read many books on how to hear the voice of God and then sharing what you have heard with others. This book goes to the next level; it provides insight on what God is saying when He is speaking to you. Note: This book goes not replace the Holy Spirit, but rather compliments what the Spirit is saying to you for a person or a given situation. I highly recommend The Prophet's Dictionary to anyone yearning to go deeper in understanding the things of the Spirit and being a mature spokesperson for God."
5,this is the WEBSTERS of the PROPHETIC- excellent,"i have purchased 4 of these- 2 as gifts & 1 for home & 1 for my car.... not all at once though- only after i got to use/benefit from this awesome resource. you know those moments where you think ""wow i could have lived forever & not known this truth...... so glad i just heard/read/saw this!"" well this WHOLE BOOK is like that. for dreamers, seers, believers & prayers i HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS BOOK!"
5,Great service,I received my book very quickly and without any problems. It was packaged wonderfully and appreciated that no delays were involved as it was a Christmas gift.
4,Very good documentary,"Very good documentary. Due to a slightly longer than wished to see introduction I did not give it 5*, other wise very good all rounder. Could be watched in conjunction with 50 years war available in DVD from AmazonThe 50 Years War - Israel & The Arabsor in a much cheaper VHSThe 50 Years War: Israel and the Arabs [VHS] which I originaly watched back in 1998 on the British TV."
1,Do not buy!,"I was very disappointed with this product. The presentation is targeted to K-12 students. This video is overpriced, the material covered is superficial, and the presentation is not entertaining."
1,defective!,"This battery charger had a short in the wiring. The plug didn't even fit all the way into the base. Didn't anybody test this product before they started selling them?My money was refunded, minus the shipping & handling both ways. So I'm out $20 for the s&h.;I should've gone to my neighborhood Fry's Electronics instead."
2,Ehh... kind of boring - AND Sonny Cheeba never flows on this,"Let me start off by stating that this CD is a promo only- most likely to be played under DJs giving the news or introducing new music. It is completely instrumental in the sense that Sonny Cheeba doesn't actually flow on it - however, in the usual Sonny Cheeba/Camp Lo style - there are samples of people talking. Well, there is one track - Sonny's Theme (#2) that some reggae singer repeats the same riff 78 times. The music itself is good, but it kind of drags after about a minute or two - most tracks are 3-5 min. NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU NEED SOME BEATS TO PLAY OVER YOUR MORNING RADIO SHOW."
2,Not original,"This cd is not in the original Russian language but in English.You have to like that kind of thing, but i don't.It is better to buy the Philips CD in the Russian language.The sound quality is good."
2,"decent budget mats, I suppose","They look and feel ok, except that the rubber nibs from one mat sink into the one below it so it looks like you have a bunch of perforations in the mat (I'm assuming this is from when they are in storage or are packed). I would guess that this would go away after some use. Unfortunately they must have cut to the wrong pattern because they did not fit my car at all. I am returning them and will probably order from someone that maintains inventory specifically for my make/model."
4,An incredibly important work,"This is the personal and medical memoir of Dr. James Yamazaki, an American of Japanese descent who went to Japan a few years after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Dr. Yamazaki went to study the effects of radiation exposure on the populace, and particularly its effects on children. Dr. Yamazaki spent several years in Nagasaki before returning to the US to continue research on the effects of radiation on children (as well as having a general pediatric practice.)In addition to his pioneering medical work, he also talked to government commissions about nuclear disarmament. He told them what he saw in Japan in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. His medical knowledge gave him the authority to speak as a peace activist as well.A highly recommended, highly moving book. It is short and easy to read and should be essential reading to all human beings about those horrible days in the history of the world."
1,boring and trivial,"This book is a pedestrian, boring record of the early Eisenhower years (the presidency). You get summaries of the cabinet meetings and that's it."
5,A Wonderful Journey . . .,"Everyone has a search for the Infinite within and Evelyn Stark does a wonderful job in describing hers. We don't often see beyond the closed doors of one's growing years, but this book certainly discloses Evelyn's path and the steps she took to find her relationship with God through the study of The Infinite Way and Joel Goldsmith's excellent teachings of the Truth as presented by Jesus.In this book, Evelyn opens wide the door to her private life in which she found her Self. A great auto-biography. We should all be so fortunate!Gail Gupton, Author: 'The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment', and 'Seekers of Truth'."
4,Oh yeah - this is the one,"Hey this is the album with the hit Black Metallic. Certainly a milestone in the whole shoegaze movement. Say what you want about Catherine Wheel, they had a pretty cool song with that and that's more than most bands. Though the time for this music has passed and I doubt any new listeners will appreciate what these early nineties bands like Ride or M.B.V. or Catherine Wheel had to offer. Tis more the pity."
5,Mezmerizing . . .,"The first 3 songs are hauntingly seductive. A *must play* for passionate make-out sessions (where I first heard the songs, myself . . . thank you, Jonathan). Highly recommended (the kissing AND the music). The next day I did a search on the Catherine Wheel, and discovered that it was a medieval torture device (sadly named after St Catherine, who died while being tortured). I've never heard why the band chose the name (or why the band broke up), but lead singer Rob Dickinson is still touring. He grew up in the UK; he's touring the US this year (2006). Back to the CD, the guitar riffs are divine. You will soar!"
3,One song makes this cd worth purchasing.,"""Black Metallic"" is a hauntingly beautiful song that more than justifies the purchase. The rest is average stuff."
5,Awesome,"I never heard of Catherine Wheel, but a friend was playing this album and I heard Texture. I was hooked. Black Metallic is my other favorite. Awesome, awesome, awesome album."
5,Deep Feeling Album,If you have ever had a deep sensual feeling you can't go wrong with this album. This dude singing reaches deep and paints it out for us to emote with him. If you never could express certain feelings then you can get help with this band. This album is an essential sensual rocking shoegazing bonanza.
5,Pictures tell a story,"I thought I understood what WWII was about and what the soldiers on both side must have gone through. But I was wrong. This book showed me a group of elite soldiers I knew nothing about, and I was amazed by their dedication and performance. Somehow we always want to think of the ""enemy"" as a group of uneducated rabble, but after reading this book, I'm amazed that the Allies did as well against this elite force as they did. Thank you Mr. Ailsby for continuing my education!"
2,bad dvd transfer,I never finished the dvd as the sound and picture were so bad. I got thru the first ten minutes and had to turn it up so loud. terrible. save your money
3,Average Plot,"The older movies usually have the better writers. Not this time. This was just OK. Of course, Angela Lansbury and Raymond Burr are superb actors!"
3,TWO POPULAR TELEVISION STARS,"I purchased this dvd because it featured two popular television stars, Raymond Burr and Angela Lansbury. The film itself was excellent and kept my interest. However, the quality of the film was grainy."
1,Avoid this collection,"I was thrilled when I saw this double feature on sale. Angela Lansbury is one of the greats of the movie world and she is especially good playing horrible women. She looks great in both films and has very good supporting casts, including Raymond Burr and Keith Andes, and she is, of course, an excellent actress. Both films are definite B movies, but they are also very cheaply made and the copies were not good. They are more high camp than suspenseful drama. I could have dealt with the poor quality of the stories, if the production values were at least adequate."
2,FILM NOIR DOUBLE FEATURE: PLEASE MURDER ME 1956/LIFTE AT STAKE 1954,I DON'T SEE WHERE CLOSED CAPTION OR SUBTITLED FOR DEAF & HARD OF HEARING? OVER 30 MILLIONS OF THIS AMERICA PEOPLE ARE DEAF/HARD OF HEARING - EVEN COHEAR IMPLANTED PEOPLE STILL NEED CC OR SDH.
2,First timer,"I know everyone on here seems to love this book. I know the author is well renowned for ""Helter Skelter"". I just found this book sort of dull and impersonal. I hope it is not as sophomoric as since there were no pictures I felt disconnected but maybe it is. I just didn't relate to Katherine or anyone else for that matter. I have no agenda. I read the book because a good reviewer on here said they liked it. I just didn't care for the book and doubt I will read any of his others. I prefer F. Lee Bailey."
5,Informative and intriguing,"Obviously, a brilliant legal mind and a fabulous writer. You won't be able to put this book down. I highly recommend it. The best way to describe it might be intellectual true crime."
4,Linda Scott Album,"This album was pretty good. We were looking for an original version of one of the songs Linda sang and found it on this CD. As it turned out, many of the others were very good too. In fact, we found some we had long forgotton. If you like the Oldies, this is a good buy."
5,Great voice- You Must have this..,Any true baby boomer or even todays music lovers should have this. Linda Scott sings her heart out on this album and hearing a lot of her songs took me back to the good old days.
4,A Couple of Missing Stars,"It sure took me a long time to reach here. What a wonderful find! But hang on, the brightest of Linda's stars are missing. Where are 'Yours' and 'This is my Prayer'? I am sure she recorded these songs. I shall keep searching!?"
3,I can't believe it !!,"Actually, I haven't purchased this item yet. I'm just thrilled to find it. I've been searching for the song ""Starlight, Starbright"" for years, without really knowing the exact name of the song. Long, long ago, when I was about to enter the 7th grade, I heard this song when I was at a friends house. The old 45 record had actually been purchased for ""Don't Bet Money, Honey"" but I liked the flip side better. Everytime that I went down the street to visit my friend Debby, I got out ""Starlight, Starbright, and played it as loud and as long as she would let me. I've sung it over the years to my friends,but no one knew the exact name or who had sung it. Thank goodness for the internet....it saved the day. After long hours of searching, I've finally found THE song. Just had to share my joy! YIPPEE!"
2,Not worth the money.,"I thought this would be a book I could come to over and over for practice. It is not. It has some tests and then you are done. That's it. This was not worth my money. If you want tests, type ""IQ test"" on any decent search engine."
4,Great in it's time and OK for an occasional listen later in life.,"This CD was not overlooked in its time and yes, millions of people did in fact buy it. It is incredibly funny and the band is moderately musically talented. The lyrics are inane but the riffs and solos are top-notch.As far as posterity goes, people will probably not buy a million more copies of this CD in the future. However, they will remember a few songs on it with a nod and maybe a chuckle. That's more than we can say for anything many other junk metal groups from the late 80's and early 90's have produced or ever will produce."
3,One album wonder.,"These guys may have looked like ""The Red Hot Chili Peppers"" or ""Faith No More"", but they sound more like ""Motley Crue"" or ""Poison"". Not that that's bad, I like them all. This pretty much consists of the huge hit ""Everything About You"", the cover ""Cat's in the Cradle"", and minor hit ""Neighbor"". The rest isn't bad, just the typical fun hard rock/hair metal of the time. This may not be essential, but it is fun to rock the air guitar to ""Everything About You"". Get it used."
4,gotta love jimi,"Though much of the interviews are previously released, its nice to have a few new performances and info. The quality is good and its always a pleasure to watch Jimi work his magic."
5,AWESOME MOVIE ABOUT ONE OF THE BEST GUITARIST EVER!!!!!!!!!!,"If you have any love for the guitar and Jimi Hendrix this is a must buy. Has awesome live shots of Jimi whaling, and very interesting interviews from some great musicians, along with some of his friends and his father (the Clapton and Townsend interviews were my personal favorates). It is the type of movie that you will watch many times over, so personally there is no way not to recommend this. The only thing that I could tell you is that if you are looking for just Jimi performances (although this one has a great many) without any interviews (because after a few time interviews do get annoying), then look at some of the recommendations on this page for other DVDs. But if your looking for a DVD with a pretty in dept view of Jimi, check this out."
2,A Disappointment,"Back about 1974-ish, there was a Hendrix LP with this exact cover. It was called ""Soundtrack to the movie Jimi Hendrix"". All songs on that album were complete. It was my favorite Hendrix album.This is not a DVD version of that album. Most of the songs on this DVD are incomplete. Purple Haze was an especially big let down. Ditto Machine Gun - it's on this DVD twice, and neither version is complete.The interviews consist of a bunch of famous people testifying to what a great guy Jimi was. Great. We already knew that.This DVD leaves a lot to be desired. For a kick @ss Hendrix DVD, get ""Jimi Plays Berkeley"". No holds barred on that one."
2,Deluxe edition a film about jimi hendrix,Where's the concert footage? Didnt have the music the album had. says 75 miniutes of concert where is it at. Not on there. Highly disappointed.
