3,good but not what I expected,"Cypress Hill has always given their fans all that and then some; maybe that is why I am left wondering where disc 2 is in this package. This ""greatest hits"" compilation has only 9 songs from a group that has been putting out top-shelf albums for about 15 years. How can that possibly add up? Don't get me wrong, there isn't a bad song on this cd, but there is so much missing. What would've really worked well for the fans would have been a 2-disc package with the first having songs from cypress hill, black sunday, and temples of boom. The second could pick from IV, skull and bones, stoned raiders, and till death do us part. Also throw some live joints on there (""aint going out like that"", ""can't get the best of me"") from the Fillmore show, and that would be more on the level with showing what the Hill is all about."
3,A Greatest Hits That Needs Improvement.....,"I have been waiting, patiently, for a new album from the Latin Thugs. When this album hit stores, I was kinda disappointed in it. Only 10 songs from all of their material, which base all the way back to 1989. It was disappointing that songs like ""Pigs"", ""Lowrider"", ""Boom Biddy Bye Bye"" and others songs that were classics, did not grace the album. However, the two brand new songs only make up for a small effort. But, for the die-hard Cypress Hill fan, like myself, it shows that they can still make great ""hits from the bong"". If you really love their music, this is for you. But, if you are looking for every single hit that they have had over the course of their career, then, this is definitely not for you."
3,"A Good Starter Set, but not Definitive--","This compilation has several, though not all, of the key cuts from their highly influential first two studiio LPs..Cypress' Urban radio play diminished as time went on, with pop/rock soon to follow.. Still, there were plenty more songs from their later LPs that should have been included, like the 'Throw your hands in the air' Erick Sermon remix, 'Boom biddy bye bye' Fugees remix, 'Trouble' and 'What's Your Number'.. the new songs, including a reggaeton experiment, are admirable..All in all, Cypress really deserves a 2-disc set-- Since they spent their entire career thus far on Columbia/Sony, One can only hope that there may be an ""Essential Cypress Hill"" on the way, maybe in 2006.For now, listeners are encouraged to get the first 3 studio LPs, plus their first Remix EP (if it's still in print).."
4,"a small, but satisfying Greatest hits from the Hill","This is a really good collection of Cypress Hill's best songs, but it's a small amount. I was expecting more than just 12 songs. A little disappointing, but still alot of good songs. This will probably be the only Greatest Hits from Cypress Hill for a while. Until then, this will have to do."
2,what a shame,"i can go and pull out all my cd's and come up with over 80 minutes of music that would easily be a reasonable greatest hits album, but they cheepshotted us. Why? I don't know, other then to try and make a profit by having a couple new songs. I love Cypress Hill, but HATE this tactic.Only reason i gave this cd 2 stars and not one is because i love the songs on here. Even though i have played each and every one to death before this cd came out, i was glad (previous to seeing the lacking track list) to see them finally release a greatest hits album. With efforts like this, they wonder why the music industry is suffering. give people what they pay for, a full cd, especially for those who had invested in all the prior cd's that allowed to make a greatest hits."
2,No answer keys for chapter reviews.,"In the book there are very nice review quizzes. The huge problem is I don't have anyway to know if I am answering them correctly since there is no answer key. To get the answers, I would have to purchase the teachers edition. I've been out of school for awhile, but I'm pretty sure the books use to have the answers in the back, so you could check your work. This is only a problem if you aren't being instructor led. If you have a teacher, you can ask them if you're doing it right. If you aren't so lucky, and you're doing college online with no instructor interaction this presents a problem."
4,Lots of review and practice activities,"I purchased this textbook for ENG 101 which I am taking through StraighterLine. I didn't care about the condition that the book was in as long as it was cheap. I bought a ""used-acceptable"" book for $9. When it arrived I was shocked at the condition... other than a few bent pages and highlighting the book was perfect! Since my course was online, I really enjoyed all the review and practice activities in this book."
1,"Slow downloads, so-so quality, POOR programming","Totally agree with the first reviewer concerning content, or rather, the lack thereof. The amount of stuff available on this thing is worse than nil, because it's mostly free, low-quality, BORING clips that you can get FOR FREE on the Internet by yourself. (E.g., try Microsoft's windowsmedia.com.) I haven't tried the premium channels but that's because there's NOTHING worth paying extra for. Downloads are slow and the video quality is VHS-like. I'm afraid to say this is a rip-off despite its cutie-looking interface. Do not buy!"
4,Fun,"Akimbo's not the greatest, granted. But it does allow access to programming not normally available to the regular television viewer. Akimbo's cool because you get original programming and favorites from top tv networks, plus the service continues to improve. If on-demand is the future of television, this is a sneak-peak."
3,Great when they come with all the parts...,"These cabinets are great if they come with all the parts. I ordered three of them with Amazon and all of them came in boxes that were damaged and opened. One of the three did not come with all the parts and did the box was destroyed beyound the ability to use it to ship it back. Amazon was helpful in the return only after I insisted that they take it back instead of making it a rubbermaid issue.I do have to say that the units that did come with all the parts are working as promised. They are a little rough around the edges since they are formed plastic, but overall I think they are great for general storage purposes."
1,Eric where are you?,"This guy obviously made the video in his basement. I spent 20 bucks on this that I might as well have burnt. This Curt character teaches scales wrong, riffs wrong, and the tablature that comes with the video is photo copied out of some guys scrap book and is illegable as well as not in proper format. Please shoot me."
3,Quit whining,"I'm sick of all the complaining about these videos. Yes, it is a low budget instructional video, but who cares? Do you need Lord of the Rings to learn Layla? If you can see the fretboard, there is something to learn.These videos are to make good guitarists better, not to teach new players to play. I think the people complaining are people that bought this with their first guitar and expected it to be easy. Sorry, but you'll have to start with ""Smoke on the Water"" and ""Me & Bobby McGee"" like the rest of us.Put in some time and come back to these tapes, maybe you'll get more out of them."
1,HORRIBLE,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO. IT IS A HOME MADE VIDEO. ITS PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO RIP YOU OFF. THE TABLATURE THAT COMES WITH THE VIDEO IS HANDWRITTEN.
3,Good overall video.,"Although Eric doesn't appear in this video, it is a very good teacher of his guitar style. It comes w/ tablature notation for following along. Also, not only does it teach the guitar style of Eric Clapton, it also encourages the viewer to create their own unique style of playing, something that is a must for any good blues musician. Josh Ritter"
5,satisfied customer,The product was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner. I would order from this seller again in the future.
2,"OK, but doesn't compare to the METRINCH","I got this product as a gift but returned it for the Metrinch set I had seen on TV. This Allied set isn't a terrible product (and it's cheaper and has a few more tools), but they really cant be compared as the Metrinch is a truly high end product and is actually a much better value as it is really 2 full sets of tools in one (Metric and Standard)."
5,From the Cover,"A determined tenderfoot risks his life to save a woman from a morman village of ""sealed "" wives!"
1,Threw it away 10 minutes after setting it up....,"My cat thought this was just an attachment of his litter box and peed directly on it almost immediately after we set it up. There was really no way to wash it so we just threw it away. What a waste of $17.99. I'm sure most cats aren't as idiotic as mine, but if your cat tends to pee on bath rugs, etc, then this is not the mat for you."
1,Needs a water barrier! Had to replace immediately.,"This thing can trap a few loose pieces of cat litter; but will not protect your carpet or hardwoods from anything. I have a big cat and sometimes his butt hangs out of the box a little bit. So, the mat can get a little wet on occasion... might as well just use a towel under your cat box as opposed to buying this."
5,Kitty Litter Catcher Extraordinaire,"I have a small one bedroom apartment and I hide the litter box in the living room in a corner. Since it is such a small room, I needed something that would catch the litter and not look hideous. This mat does just that and am very pleased with the amount it catches. Hardly any litter (that I can tell) makes it past this mat. It is also easy to clean. I had originally been shaking it out every morning, but switched to vacuuming it, which picks up the litter well when you vacuum along the grain of the mat. One time my cat had tracked a little bit of poo out of his box (while we were visiting the in-laws) and the mat caught all that as well with none getting on the actual carpet (whew). This was also easy to clean up with a damp cloth and some wiping. I am very glad that I purchased this mat and would definitely recommend it."
3,LitterMaid Review,"Summery: Works great for trapping litter, but for $18 you basically get a cheap square of carpeting.Pros: Large, litter effectively trappedCons: Price, almost too large, I had to cut it down to fit in the space I keep the litter.The thing I noticed almost immediately when I opened the packaging was the LitterMaid is extremely similar material to an old doormat I had. On my next trip to target and upon checking their discount doormat I found the very same ridged carpet doormat for about 5 dollars (you can just search their website for the cheapest one, you'll see what I mean). On the plus side, it works great, in the last two weeks I haven't had to sweep up any litter outside my cat's box. Given I have hardwood floors, and my Cat's hairy Maine Coon paws seem almost designed TO track litter around, I have to say I'm satisfied.But my advice to you is to buy a cheap door mat and cut it to fit your space, because that's basically what you're buying here."
4,A solution for your litter problems to be had inside this review.,"We found a mat at PetSmart for almost $40. Told hubby, let's look on Amazon; found this one for about $15. Yay! Problem solved, right? This one had the best reviews out of a whole slew of mid-to-cruddy products.When the box arrived I opened it; wow it sure is smaller than I expected. Even knowing the dimensions. And ... it looked so familiar. Yes, I've seen this material before: they sell it as door mats at home improvement stores! We have these SAME MATS in our store in fact. Only you get HUGE ones..you could get a floor mat and cut it up, and have several mats.I will say that this material is good for catching litter, it has grooves. But I have to use the attachment on my vacuum to get out the litter, not just the vacuum itself. It will eat the edges of the mat (not finished well) and just not do a good job unless you have a nice attachment to suck up the debris from between the ridges."
3,LitterMaid LMC100 Litter Box Carpet,"LitterMaid LMC Litter-Box Carpet served its purpose. I have a large litter box for two kittens. The carpet fits perfect under the litter box. I wish it were larger esp, for the price I paid for it. I ended up buying another piece of carpet at a reminant store. Its much better now"
3,Not real practical for use with the tent,"Ok lets get real...If you purchased the tent this does not fit in it. Then you have 2 options for use of this rug. First, put it under the tent to help cut down on the noise and vibration of the product. Second, put it in front of the tent for additional catch for the litter. If you didn't get it free with your box, then don't buy it. You can get a litter catch or a rug to cut down on the noise for less money at the store. But by all means if you don't need the tent and it comes with your box then use it."
3,Litter box carpet,"I like the looks of this carpet, but it does not prevent the litter from getting on the floor. It is a good size, not bad looking, and maybe I expect too much. I just wish they had something that the litter stuck to. Oh well. It was a good buy."
4,Effective litter trapper,The LMC100 litter box carpet is a good size and traps 99% of the sand that I previously found scattered near & far.
4,Good may for litter,"We purchased this litter mat for our cats litter box. It would drive me nuts when litter would get all over the floor in our linoleum bathroom, getting scattered everywhere. This mat has definitely helped with a litter control problem. The ridges in the mat help to prevent the litter from getting on the floor. It is big enough to capture a lot of litter. When I change the litter box, all I do is get the vacuum out and sweep up this rug, and that's it. This mat is highly recommended by me, due to its effectiveness at capturing the little granules the litter. That said, I think it was a little overpriced. However, i had a difficult time trying to find anything that would be similar to this. If you want product that's going to work, then buy this. If you can find it for a little cheaper elsewhere, then they give that a shot. I do recommend this mat though."
4,It works for me,I don't have much to say. It just works for me I don't have sand grains all over my place any more and I am happy
3,Overpriced,"Save your money and go buy a doormat instead. There is nothing that special about this, and any piece of rug the same size would probably work just as well."
2,Not good enough,"I thought for the price, this mat would keep the litter from getting everywhere. It is hard to clean this mat and I find litter on the bare floor as before. So I am going to find another one. I do not recommend this mat because it doesn't do what it advertises it is suppose to do. It is also extremely hard to keep clean, which doesn't make any sense."
4,Bigger then I thought,"This mat is a good size and despite any beliefs you have, I am here to tell ya the thing works wonderfully. Catches so much litter I was amazed after a few days. I feel its worth every penny."
3,Not bad but not good either,"We use World's best cat litter and I think the cat throws litter from the box just to spite us. We put this mat out and it does collect her litter. However, unless you vacuum this mat you sitll have litter dust all over the thing; sweeping alone does not get the litter off the mat. Then one day I found this exact same mat at our big box home improvement store. It was the same size and everything but it wasn't folded, rolled, and put in a box to market it for cat use. It was marketed for boots, lying flat, and less than half the price."
5,Great Product!! Catches the litter and easy to clean,This litter box carpet is awesome!!! As my cats leave the box it picks up the litter from their paws so no more tracking litter around the house! Best of all it is really easy to clean! I would recommend this product to anyone who has a houseful of kitties!
4,It works!,"We just got a new kitten and I was dreading the litter box scatter problem. Our last cat would get it everywhere. We tried everything with her. Crystal litter was the closest we ever got to containing the scatter to the laundry room. Litter box carpet didn't work for her, because she'd just jump over it.Enter LitterMaid Litter Box Carpet. I use it in conjunction withClevercat Top Entry Litter BoxandPrecious Cat Kitten Attract Kitten Training Litter. This litter box carpet is soft to the touch, so the kitten doesn't avoid walking on it. It is large, so she will jump onto it. It is textured with rows of carpet grooves to catch stray litter. Although there is still scatter, the difference is phenomenal. The best thing is litter doesn't track into the carpet just outside the laundry room."
4,great little litter carpet,Perfect little carpet to cleanse kitty's paws after using the facilities. Not completely foolproof (what is?) but definitely keeps the litter box area from looking like a beach.
4,Good quality mat for the job it does,This mat is large enough to fit under the cat box and still have some left over for my kitty to step on his way out of the box. My only complaint would be that I wished that it came in different colors.
3,Fine mat,"This mat is a nice size to go under the litter box. I have no complaints about the product itself, though looking back, could have purchased something comparable at a cheaper price if I had shopped for a regular mat instead of a ""litter box mat."""
4,"works, but not big enough","The carpet keeps the litter from spreading all over the place, but for the price it is a little small. I should have bought 2."
4,Less Litter spreading,Mat was as advertised and in good condition when received. Laid flat quickly and is keeping the tracking from 5 cats to a minimum as intended. Most of the litter is caught by the mat. Somewhat difficult to get caught litter out of mat.
3,doesn't work well,this is a nice size mate for my two baby cats and their litter box. i think it is big enough for them to come out of the litter and clean themselves on it. but the problem is it doesn't really help to trap everything. i still have to clean the floor everyday and yank the mat to get rid of the semi-trapped litter off otherwise it will be worse the day after. it is very annoying.i was hoping to get something better than this for the money I paid.
5,Great rifle scope!,Took my first hog with this scope about 275 yards out. It holds up pretty well so far. I Would definitely buy another one if I have another rifle to mount it on.
3,Faint Recticle,This is my second Nikon Rifle Scope. Light transmission is great. My only problem is that the recticle is too thin and can be hard to see where the crosshairs actually cross. The little circles for the BDC are also hard to see (assuming my eyes are good :). I would probably go with the Nikoplex recticle like on my first Nikon Scope which I would give 5 stars.
2,Blahhhhh,"The book reads ok, but the subject matter is very one sided and blah. There are many good points in the logic of the material, but once again one sided."
2,What a shame!,"The Sweetest Days by Vanessa Williams is a lovely cd from this beautiful and talented woman but there are some flaws along the way. The Sweetest Days is a gorgeous song and so is Long Way Home but the rest of the album is very boring and forgettable. Vanessa's vocals are spot on but even with that improvement these songs have no life in them, not an album I have in my collection anymore."
2,a little advice,"dont buy this cd!!! there is one good song on it and thats ""betcha never"", otherwise its not all the good."
5,Great Music!,"I've been listening to Vanessa Williams' music for the last 10 years,and she only gets better. I pulled this CD out today and remembered how much I love that great song,""The Sweetest Days"". I highly recommend this and any of Vanessa's albums if you want to listen to a great muical talent!"
4,I love it,I think it is fantastic.If she could get a 21 year old like me to like it she has a fan 4 life now .
4,Another Good Album,"Vanessa Willams is one of my favorite singers. Her voice is very different, and yet, very sweet. I have most of her albums, (including her Christmas album). This cd is good because, her songs are unforgetable. My favorite songs are ""The Sweetest Days"", & ""Higher Ground"", well, there's more I like but, I can't think of them right now. Go get this album it's very well done."
1,Not Helpful for the Average Person,"At the risk of going contrary to everyone else who has reviewed this book...Too frequently it suggests one get the injured person to the nearest hospital. Or suggests they get a physician in to help. Or suggests one acquire different prescription medicines. There is a plethora of suggestions along the lines that one should encourage primative mothers to give their children fruit instead of sodas, if they have any money for snacks. I bought this book based on the glowing reviews, but after looking it over, I returned it. Maybe wonderful for the Peace Corps but not for the average household wishing to avoid the medical profession as much as possible. If you are thinking along these lines, this book was not written for you. Most of it is common sense. If you cannot figure out that a person with severe bleeding should be kept immobile and not fed, then by all means get this book!"
4,great for those in 3rd word countries,This is great for those in 3rd world countries but be cautious not everything is factual. For insistence for burns this book says melt Vaseline and put it on the burn. It seems like a bad idea to me.
1,Review before buying,"Well, at the risk of incurring the wrath of all the others, I would say it would be best to try to review the book before purchasing if one is indeed interested in family preparedness in the USA. This is not the best forum to argue world view or intent. Check out the book before you buy; plain and simple. Perhaps those with extensive training will forgive us who do not have the head knowledge and/or experience to fill in the obvious gaps in the text. A different perspective, we who dissent have, looking at ourselves as potential patients. Maybe the author(s) will revise or produce a companion text with the layman in mind (hint, hint). Thank you and be gentle."
1,Terrible,Shipping was fast and the book was in good condition. I thought I was buying a medical handbook that could be used to self diagnose and determine if the illness or injury was serious enough to warrant a trip to the doctor. What I got was a politically motivated book of propaganda. Avoid this book. The only use I got out of it was taking it to work and having some good laughs with my coworkers(by the way I'm in the Army and our medical Platoon found it especially funny). Seriously it lacks in detailed medical treatment and assessment.
3,Prepared Medically for disasters,"I found this book to be more for someone in a third world country with very little hygiene education, instead of a book to help you if a national disaster should happen in our area and we needed to know some basic medical helps. I was disappointed."
5,Excellent guide for taking personal responsibility for your health,"Although this was compiled for village health-care, it is also a useful general guide to low-cost medical procedures & medicines. It includes excellent sections on ways to prevent and contain serious illnesses."
5,Very useful material,"David Werner has assembled a wonderful primer for anyone rendering care in the third world. There is useful information for everyone from lay people to MDs, well worth the time it takes to read the book. I especially like the succinct treatment plans with common and inexpensive medications. Treating patients in the third world without a laboratory, X-ray, or other modern tools takes a different mindset that WHERE THERE IS NO DOCTOR puts into perspective.Strongly recommended. I'm taking a copy back to the mountains of Panama with me next week."
4,Useful in Africa,"I read this book years ago while posted in Gabon with the Peace Corps. Since I was 5hrs (by car) from the nearest western doctor, this book was indispensible. It was also useful to show to African friends and those curious about the English language or western medicine.My only complaint is that the book could use better (more detailed) pictures."
4,I can only pray I never need to use this,"In all fairness, I should probably give this another star but I am not a dr. so I am reluctant to give the final ""Thumbs Up"". Still, it looks to be an invaluable resource in an emergency situation. At this point I want to repeat- I can only pray I never need this. That being said, I am putting it with my First Aid kit."
5,A must for medical missionaries...,"Clear, concise, illustrated, and practical are but a few words that describe of this book. I especially appreciated the ""attitude"" of the book... not only one of healing the sick, but also one of teaching those in the village how to establish a medical community of their own. It's a great book to use and then leave for those with whom you've been working. ""Where There Is No Dentist"" would be a good companion, as well."
5,"Amazingly concise; for the non-medics among us, this makes sense.","I really think that if you are an inhabitant of this planet, you need this book. We may or may not ever be caught in a situation that any of this knowledge would be required, but stuff of every imaginable kind, big and small, happens (watch the news). Being for-armed with skills and information helps. Reading this book, helps. Do yourself a favour, buy it, read it, take a first-aid class, put it somewhere safe, and remember where that is. I'm a little older than I thought I would get, I no longer hide stuff.Cheers, Gary"
3,When There Is No Doctor,"It is a very good little handbook that we could use in the US, but a lot of it is addressing Hispanic countries. But in case of a grid breakdown, anyone can benefit at least some from it and perhaps save some lives."
4,"Good book, but not the only one you need.",Definitely a must have for any emergency preparedness library. I do however recommend you have other medical and first aid books as well.
2,Very VERY basic,"Unless you have no experience with basic medical care you will likely find this book very elementary and you would be better off buying a boy scout's handbook, although it wouldn't cover some of the female items, it would give you more information on dealing with the day to day.The numerous references about 'seeing a doctor' defy the title and purpose implied by the book."
4,"Missionary student, have used this book.","Excellent for use in third world countries. Every missionary should own a copy of this book. The only reason I do not give 5 stars to this book is because of the philosophies of David Werner on community development, which contradict biblical community development ideas. For instance, he promotes some non-conservative ideas about birth control. So Christians, just be careful whose hands this book gets into. I would give the same warning about the ""where there is no women doctor"" book. That one is definitely not worth buying, you're better off with a good basic handbook on childbirth and prenatal care."
5,Fantastic book for life overseas,This has been invaluable when I have lived overseas and there was no doctor. It is good for people who already do know something about medicine.
4,Bad Teeth,"If your ever in a place that you need dental work, this book will show you the basics of care!"
2,This is a Gimmick Album,"If you already own the Crunk Juice album basically what they did is they got the Crunk Juice Album and lowered the pitch. You can find free software on the internet and lower the pitch of the original tracks for free. Even the skits were the same gimmick. They just lowered the pitch. Usher sounds closer to Barry White on ""Lovers and Friends."" Don't waste your money on this gimmick."
2,Sound is weak,"Maybe I got the only set that is muffled for most of the playing time, but this set of CD's is difficult to hear unless you are right next to it with the volume at full blast. This makes it a poor choice for the classroom or the car. The quality of the production is excellent; the sound just can't be adjusted loudly enough to listen to easily."
3,It is a good machone for drafting work.,It does all a drafting person needs.Only drawback is the printer is loud.
2,Erudite but also pompous and windy,"Robert Hughes has an enormous following, but I think it often has to do with people being impressed at his erudition (which is jaw-dropping) rather than at his actual insightfulness. He often pontificates when you would rather he would just describe or make a sustained argument; although this work is enormously informative, it lacks direction and drive when compared with some of Hughes' more successful works."
1,Barcelona,"I am a fan of Robert Hughes, but this book is a bit dated. It seemed to have been written in anticipation of the Olympics being held there and I bogged down about half way through."
3,more hype than anything,"It's not a bad book at all but my main grudge point comes from my interest in sports. Barcelona is famous for its soccer club FC Barcelona. It is, and was, a symbol of Catalan nationalism especially in the era when Franco ruled Spain (and Madrid's Real Madrid ruled not only the Spanish soccer league but Europe as well). The battles between the two clubs are legendary both on and off the field. Throughout Franco's reign the only outward expression of Catalan nationalism was at Barca's home ground, the Nou Camp, when fans sang protest songs and waved the Catalan flag.Hughes basically ignores all that completely. Now you non-sports fans will think so what, but it is like talking about Catholicism without mentioning its symbols and idols.That aside, it's a good read just disappointing from my POV."
5,An important historical perspective,"I read Hughes' Barcelona before I went to Barcelona for the first time, and it made all the difference in the world. I arrived not as a stranger, but as a student of Catalan culture and history. The book gave me the background to have an informed perspective on what I was seeing. It may be long, but it has tons of information. My only complaint is that Hughes assumes the reader has a knowledge of history that I, for one, don't have. So there were things I didn't understand.I liked that Hughes sometimes talked about the big things -- big events, important people, and he sometimes talked about the little things that make a place distinctive. His love of the place came through to me, and I fell in love with it too."
4,Good detail on Barcelona and Catalunya,"Robert Hughes' ""Barcelona"" is the book that I wish that I had before I went to live in and around Barcelona, and since it came along after that time, reading it made me want to go back to that city again and again. By all means, if you plan to visit Barcelona or any other city in Catalunya, dedicate the time necessary to absorb this book before you go. It is not light reading, nor is it a ""guidebook."" The format doesn't really lend itself to a brief and casual visit -- but the market is full of those alternatives. Instead, you gain a more fulfilling context and deeper historical perspective. ""Barcelona"" is a bit like the famous Canaletas fountain near the head of the Ramblas. Once you have drunk from it, as they say, you are thereafter certain to return to the city."
1,Sticky and Oily,"I purchased this product because I read a review that the smell was great. First of all I put it on and my skin was very greasy. The smell was strong but not pleasant. Someone else may like the scent, but I didn't. It reminded me of stale hay or something like that. I will not be purchasing this again."
4,Concentrated information in a slim publication,"There are only 46 pages of what may have started as a personal notebook pre-dating the digital age. It was used when I studied graphic design (pre-Macintosh), and is still being recommended by instructors 30 years later. In some ways, it is difficult to read being as most of it was hand-inked, but that's how our notebooks were done back when. Every important graphic design topic is covered in this slim volume. Nowadays, there are 300-page books available that cover each topic to include color images and expansive elaboration. Consider this a ""cliff notes"" version or a thick cheat sheet in one. Easy to pack away for quick refreshing of terminology. I keep mine at my work station."
5,A must for all Graphic Designers,This book is a great reference and reminder of the basic elements that make graphic design and visual communication effective! Every student in any graphic design program should buy this book!Gregg Berryman knows what he is writing about!
4,Factory-Reconditioned DEWALT DC500R 2 Gallon Cordless/Corded Wet Dry Vac,everything is very good. I would have given it a 5 star if the cord had been twice as long.
4,An efficient Revlon product,Really works well. Wish that it had an automatic shutoff though. I should have looked closer at the curling iron information before I purchased the product.
4,just what I needed!,"I bought this curling iron to do my hair for Halloween. It gave me perfect ringlets! I love the fact that is has multiple heat settings, because my hair is thick enough that I need the hottest setting. I would reccommend this prosuct to others, it's a good brand, and it works great!"
5,Revlon Amber Waves Curling Iron..,"I own several different types of curling irons and hands down this is my favorite one. I like that is has the heat control dial that goes up to 25. It does get very hot so be careful. I have really thick Asian hair and it can be pretty resistant to curling but along with a light misting of hairspray this iron does great things for my hair. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this by accident on Amazon and decided to get it. Owning like almost 10 curling irons I just about gave up. Buy this, you won't be disappointed!!"
4,Nice curls,"i purchased this for my sister, but I tried it first. It gets hot pretty fast, and the curls are good. Even though, I would prefer a thinner stick next time, but I guess that varies with the type of hair you have."
5,Curl it up!,"Revlon Amber Waves RV664AWC Gold Curling Iron, 0.38 Inch This product is a pretty good micro curling iron. It is becoming harder and harder to find them in retail stores. The curling iron produces tight curls, has a built in dual voltage setting for different countries and the temperture setting is on the side and can be adjusted to 25 max. You will be able to get close to the hair shaft. This can be a good thing if you have short or ethnic hair. In addition, if you have natural or chemically treated hair, please make sure you use a hair protectant to help minimize the damage from the heat. Chemically relaxed hair requires less heat then non chemically relaxed hair in most cases. Buying this micro curling iron will truly save you money compared to what a trip to the salon would cost. The curling barrel diameter is smaller then what is shown in the Revlon amber waves picture and it is pretty long."
3,Minor Problem,Generally I use only Revlon curling irons and until now have been extremely happy and honestly I am still happy with the curling ability of this product but the cord tangles so bad it makes it hard to use. The part at the back of the curling iron that is supposed to twist as you curl to keep the cord from tangling needs to be updated to function better.
3,average curling iron,"Alright, I guess the downside of this type of curling iron is that it doesn't have that smooth ceramic hot iron feel. It heats up good and curl your hair fine, but I keep getting my hair stuck between the clip if I pick up too much hair to curl at once. So you just have to be careful and pick a small chunk of hair at a time.An average curler."
3,Too much work,"The curling iron is pretty to look at but, does not heat up enough to curl the hair. I was disappointed."
5,Curling iron purchase,"I ordered the Revalon gold curling iron, it was just what I wanted. I had searched at every store I could in my area looking for the 1/2' curling iron. I had my daughter search in Oregon in the stores near where she lives. Amazon is the place I found it. The curling iron works great. The service at Amazon is great. I by mistake ordered 2 curling irons. Amazon was very good at helping me return the extra curling iron and refunding my money."
1,I wish I never opened the package,"I love the idea of a stoned person doing funny things and I thought this would be right up my alley. Not so. This is not a funny movie. I regret opening the package because I won't be able to return it now. There is no script, plot, or humor. Waste of good money. I have indicated one star because I can't mark no stars."
2,It's Okay to Be Stupid... If You're Funny...,"Anna Faris is the only bright spot in an otherwise inane film. The problems begin with the screenplay; populated by one-note characters, a non-existent storyline and dreadful dearth of jokes. One must wonder if the writer or director had ever partaken of the forbidden flora, as the experience is depicted as being akin to dropping acid after a 3 day meth bender, full of talking dogs and flaming skulls. John Krasinski has nothing to do in this film and only succeeds in being as boring as his character is implied to be. The ""plot"" revolves around a young ""actress"" who spends all day getting high and playing video games. Her one and only love is her expensive new bed, and it is the threat of losing this bed that drives the ""action"" in the film. It's nonsensical, unenlightening, and worst of all, unfunny."
3,Quirky comedy,"Following ""Mysterious Skin"" Gregg Araki goes to nonsense and delivers a quirky comedy that boasts one of the funniest performances of Anna Faris. Faris is a gifted comedian that thus far hasn't had the chance to really find material worth her natural comedic talents - until ""Smiley Face"" that is. Anna Faris plays Jane F. an actress (majored in Economics) that is constantly stoned, something that gets increasingly worse when she accidently eats her roommate's dipped muffins. The film basically follows Jane's attempts to go through her day totally high out of her wits. An interesting comedy definitely worth checking out."
5,Wonderful change of pace,"Smiley Face is a great, funny, and stimulating change of pace from the normal stoner comedies. Yeah, sure it's exaggerated, but the best ones ARE! ^_^ Wonderful, funny movie. Jane Lynch rocks it! Anna Faris is the new face of Comedy."
5,Good movie,"Bought this used as a cheap Christmas gift (understood by the recipient.) DVD was in good condition.If you are wondering what the movie is about: It's sort of like Napoleon Dynamite, meets stoner movie (although there is no actual smoking after the first few minutes) + Anna Faris.The result is Faris dopily running around the streets of California with an important task list to complete. It's a pretty interesting movie."
3,Not Bad - Stoner Film,"This movie is a comedy about a girl who smokes a lot of pot. One day she accidentally eats hash cupcakes, spends the electric money on pot, accidentally steals an important document, etc. She has to fix her problems while under the influence of Mary Jane.Though defiantly not the funniest movie, it does have its moments. Keep in mind this movie would be a lot funnier to those who smoke a lot of pot or watch the movie drink.I think for a comedy, the plot keeps you interested to get to the end because the main character keeps messing up more and more, you just want to see if she can fix it. With that in mind, the end, unfortunately, wasn't spectacular. Rent this movie if your drunk, stoned, or into comedy (such as myself)."
1,not so much,"Insulted for mj and not laughing. To be fair tho, did not watch all the way through. Love the actress tho."
1,Maybe it's funny if you're high,"The acting is atrocious. The plot (if you can call it that) is ridiculous. I did laugh at a few things, but overall, it was a complete waste of time. It might seem funny if you're high. On the other hand, so might a bag of Doritos."
2,Very disappointing,"The presentation of this video is terrible. You would think that Mr. Mitchell could've dressed up a little and made himself look presentable. His playing is good...not great. He gets some of the bazillion riffs he plays downright wrong (I've seen Stevie play...and Mitchell is way off.) The tab that comes with the video....forget it. I couldn't even read it, the songs are not labeled, and the pages aren't even attached together."
1,A waste of Money,"I got this DVD as a gift. I put it in the DVD and it was all ads for the different Guitar method DVDs. So many I couldn't even find the part it was bought for. Then finally.... Curt Mitchell plays a riff full speed then half speed. No instruction. Its a waste unless maybe your already at Stevie's level. It should say on the case what level of experience its for.And because it doesn't, its a rip off. I will never ever buy any Guitar method product. I will also tell family & friends."
1,Has anyone actually seen this DVD?,"I bought a copy, and I rented a copy on Netflix ... both had the ""50 Blazing Riffs"" version on the disc (a version I already had). I was quite miffed that I spent a lot of money and time getting this just to find out that the people making it have crossed up (apparently) a lot of these and printed them on the wrong discs and put them in the wrong jackets. Buyer Beware!!"
3,Good deterrant.,"This will only slow down a serious theif. Lack of visibility could cause someone to drive off with the lock on the wheel and damage the vehicle.Good for trailers, but I wouldn't bet my car on it!"
1,Hardened lock maybe.... very low quality steel,"Stupid apartment complex realized that this lock is easy to remove with the wheel, so they booted two of my wheels. I put on my two spares and left. It is INCREDIBLY easy to remove from the wheel because the steel used is quite mild and bends easily. I won't say how to do it, but I will say that I had never seen one of these before and it was off in less than 10 minutes. May be good to keep people from ""borrowing"" your car, but shouldn't be used on other people's cars to extort money. Keep in mind that this is the lowest-priced device on the market. You get what you pay for."
2,Take off the wheel and then steal the car,Nothing is stopping the theif from taking the wheel off to bypass the lock.
4,Geisha's have more fun,"My son, yes my son, who is 8, loves this kimono. He likes to pretend he is Mulan when wearing it. So far it is wearing very well, but we both wish it had come with the displayed fan."
3,"A Good Start, but not the Last Word","The Landsknechts, by Douglas Miller, is a good basic introduction to these mercenary soldiers and campfollowers of the Holy Roman Empire during the Renaissance. As its original publication was in 1976, its scholarship is understandably outdated. It serves well as an all-around overview of the organization, weapons, tactics, battles, and lifestyles of the landsknechte, and would be a good volume for study by those with a passing interest in the subject. If you are serious about studying, reenacting, or re-creating the landsknechte, I would recommend that you read this book, along with the other landsknecht-oriented Osprey books, and then seek out more serious and scholarly works, especially those of more recent publication. -Anjabeth"
4,An excellent introduction!,"If you're looking for a single book to start someone off on the path towards understanding everyone's favorite multi-colored mercenaries, this is the book for you. Seriously though, it covers a lot of material that the uninitiated wouldn't even know to look for, and provides an excellent starting point for further research."
1,Spastic Cat Press Ignores Fort's Revision,"Not worth a rating of any stars, this novel was considerably revised by Fort after its first publication; however, that does not stop Spastic Cat Press from copying the original text from a free website and ignoring the revised chapters. Don't waste your money buying this version."
1,Way outdated,First things first: they are VENOMOUS SNAKES NOT POISONOUS. I agree with the other review it is very backward.
2,Other reviewer is exactly right,"I actually work at a zoo as a herpetologist and have to constantly tell people, if it bites you and you die, it's venomous, if you eat it or rub on it and you die, it's poisonous. There are no such things as venomous mushrooms!. SNAKES ARE VENOMOUS! Hard to believe they made that mistake."
3,The Story Continues,"In this book, Aki starts making the transformation into the progenitor. Mean while, a girl named Chidori shows up on the door step of Aogiri dance school asking for Ceres.From here on, you'll have to find out via other people or by reading it. It picks up where Suzumi left off and continues to gather steam. It will make you want to find out what happens in the next volume, Mikage, even more. It will answer what happens to Touya and what change is occuring in Aki."
1,Give This One a Pass,Tiresome repitition marks this novel. Enduring the imaginings of the protagonist to no valid conclusion is beyond irksome. I'd rather have a root canal than have to endure the scene in the Tokyo cinema where the author goes to great lengths to describe a black & white Russian art film. Must have had a contract to produce a book and threw this together.
4,This is a really good book,I read Cloud Atlas first then after reading that one I had to have all his books...This was such a cool book..I was hooked after the first page.
2,Better to watch Primetime Television than read this book,"I am by no means a vehement critic of all things David Mitchell--on the contrary, I would count his ""Cloud Atlas"" as among the best books I have ever read. However, the two books I have read from his beginner days--Ghostwritten and Number 9 Dream--are simply trashy.Both these books, in their quest to be edgy and postmodern, just throw gobs of offensive imagery at the reader. There are extensive references to cheap sex, illegal drug use, and extreme violence. It's a tactic that makes these books glean good reviews on account of the fact they ""take risks"" or ""push the envelope."" Don't be fooled by it!Reading ""Number 9 Dream,"" in my opinion, is little better than watching an episode of ""CSI"" or ""The Sopranos"" on television. In other words, this book isn't literature--it's cheap pulp."
1,Mitchell is no Murakami,"Utter tripe. Trying to read this meandering, narcissistic drivel was like trying to avoid being choked to death with wads of soggy newspaper. ""Ghostwritten"" was a moderately good novel, but being beaten to death by a gang of angry pygmies would be preferable to trying to wade through the bilge of ""Number9Dream."""
4,Mitchell's most difficult,"This book was, for me, Mitchell's most difficult. The story line is disjointed, and goes from reality, to fantasy, to dreams, and back to reality. This is not to say the book is unorganized or poorly written. On the contrary, taken as a whole it works very well.In a nutshell, the books is about a young man trying to find his father. What happens along the way is what makes up the crux of this book. Reading it reminded me of the phrase, ""It's not the destination, but the getting there."" On the ""getting there"" to find his father, the protagonist endures some horrific things.Although this book may require additional readings to really sink in (more so than Mitchell's other books), my experience tells me that those are the kinds of stories that stay with you for a lifetime."
4,Nothing Like You're EVer Read Before,"Eiji Miyake, a 20-year-old looking for his father in Tokyo. Seems like a simple plot? Well, you won't know what you're going to get. Centralled on a seemingly simple storyline, we follow the trials, imagination and dreams of Eiji Miyake in a chaotic world.You either love it of hate it. You can either sit back, accept that the novel is out of this world and lose yourself in it to allow the story to whisk you away on a roller-coaster ride, or choose to question its logic and order. I adivse the former."
5,Quick daily devotions everyone loves,We used this book in our school. The students loved it so I decided to get it for my children at home. They love it as well. We read one devotion (page)per day. Very informative. Highly recommended.
5,Great book to use for devotions,Wanted a book to use for devotions that had some trivia to go along with the message and this book was perfect. It has some really interesting trivia and great little messages. Our family has really enjoyed using this book for devotions.
1,Poorly researched,"If you only use the 18th and 19th centuries as guide then of course China never made anybody money. I know of NO CEOs today who studied this period. All they now care about is that they get a foot in the door of this huge booming market before their competitors do, and it's a scramble. Many companies have made 100%, 200% or more return on their investment in a couple of years, which must be news to Studwell basking in the Italian sun.Read David Sheff's China Dawn and Cesar Bacani's The China Investor for a look at the future."
4,Good counter balance to most pro-China business books.,"A solid overview of the difficulties foreigners have faced when trying to make direct investments in China. Some of Mr. Studwell's arguments get stale after frequent repetition, but the points raised are mostly valid and well explained. Recommended reading for people thinking about doing business in China - any prospective business plan should at least include strategies for avoiding the pitfalls in this book."
2,better than the Gibson store prices!!! still too much!,"ever shopped at the Gibson store for their products? Only if you need to feel ANGER or Hilarious!$85 for a Tee-shirt!! $97 for a decent ""mechanic shirt"" !!! This dragonfly is not my style, more like a Hawaiian-looking to me, but my Fender and Gretsch-wearing friends will hae to keep laughing at my ""not-guitar"" shirts when we jam and gig. If Gibson gets a single govt. subsidy dollar to make up for their PP marketing, I will throw up!!"
3,Not formatted for kindle!,this is a wonderful book BUT not formatted for Kindle...no dates provided for daly devotional!
2,Kindle version,II have had much frustration over the lack of dates in the Kindle version! I own the leather version also but purchased the Kindle book for portability. It has been impossible for me to keep track. Even morning and evening readings are not delineated clearly. Too bad--it was a $9.99 rip-off. I guess I'm really knocking the Kindle experience--not the book.
3,Daily Light Kindle edition,"This is my all time favorite devotional book - so I purchased (for portability) without previewing the reviews, etc. How disappointed that the kindle formatting is not true to the original. No denotations of dates or morning & evening - so, I'm spending an enormous amount of time adding a note for each date using my hard copy as a guide. In retrospect - I probably would not have purchased - however, when I finish ""dating"" it, I'll be glad I did."
4,Favorite Scriptural Devotion Book,"As many reviewers have said, this is a wonderful devotional book. The devotions are made up of pure scripture - one devotion for the morning and one for the evening. I have been doing this devotion online for free for many years and finally decided to buy myself a hard copy.This particular version is bound leather and approximately 5.5"" by 4.5"", so it is a good size to carry in your purse or with you in your car.The only thing I wish that the description had passed on is that the pages are made out of thin bible pages. For my personal preference, I would have rather had thicker paper for this book. But nonetheless, it is still a wonderful book and I would recommend it highly."
1,"DON""T BUY THE KINDLE VERSION","I just bought this kindle book of Daily Light and it is awful. I own a paper version already. The paper version is WONDERFUL but the kindle version is AWFUL. DON'T buy it. This book is supposed to be read daily according to the date, but there is no date in the e-book version. There is no Table of Content either. This e-book is just a long pdf-like document with point of reference what-so-ever. So I can't get to the place I want to read. This e-book is a trash. Totally useless. I want my money back. Amazon should not sell this. It's cheating its customers."
5,Favorite Daily Devotional,"This has been a favorite daily devotional for many years now. Since it is only scripture with no commentary it is perfect for meditative reading. Each morning and evening reading becomes an opportunity for further study and allows the Holy Spirit speak truth to your heart. I highly recommend this wonderful leather bound edition, it makes a perfect gift for any occasion."
2,Description and Preview Inaccurate,"I just received this book and was quite confused when I sat down to read it. The preview provided is not even close to the lay out of the book. The book is not divided by date or even in to ""day"" and ""night"" -- there is one devotion per page. I have no idea why Anne Graham Lotz's name is on the Amazon description as her name is no where on the actual book. I don't believe that the entire original book is even here (it does say it is ""abridged""). There are 173 pages with 1 devotional on each page. If the original has 2 for everyday, there should be over 700. The scripture quotations used are from the New Life Version translation. Not the most accurate description by Amazon."
5,Daily Light...burgundy leather..Lotz,This is a new version of the original book by Samuel Bagster in England....1794.....It's a wonderful daily guide and a perfect gift...The leather is beautiful....
3,Needs support,This tool caddy is handy but needs support. Should be attached to the wall for maximum strength.
4,this is a good item,"i ilke to keep these rakes and stuff from falling all over this helps, i wish it were even bigger. i recommend it."
4,Garden Tool Stand,The garden tool storage unit is a good value. It does pretty much as advertised. It is a little wobbly and I plan to attach it to the wall. Because of a foundation edge around the garage one side will be higher than the other when it is next to the wall. This can be solved with a piece of 1 1/4 plastic pipe cut to the correct height and this fits in the socket for the plastic pipes in the unit.
1,Simply The Worst Movie!,"Okay, listen up LUNA, stop making movies!!This film actually pisses me off...it's that bad. Can you imagine how manyhungry children in the world you could have fed instead of wastingall that money on making this unwatchable crap? And leave Val Kilmeralone! He's a great actor and certainly unworthy of your lack ofvision, talent and storytelling.SO there!"
3,Creepy and worth watching,"This movie is pretty good. A lot of the plot does not make sense and definitely leads a lot to be explained.. but never is.It does capture creepyness well with the use of shadows, darkness and perhaps ghosts of little children and religious imagery.The film makes the audience think a little bit, and wonder. if you want spoon fed horror or lots of slash, blood and gore this is not for you.This movie could have been a lot better, but it is worth watching and does have some scary disturbing scenes."
3,Great Movie - More VeSchya!!!,"Its dark, gloomy and sometimes hard to understand what the actors are saying because of poor audio production, mixed accents and echoing tunnels - - -BUT- - - It's also a Rare Gem in cinema these days!FINALLY! An Original Script! I don't know HOW it made it thru production, w/o checks bouncing, but I'm really glad it didI'm tired of Hollywood's Single-Minded approach to the art of making movies:""Ya! I think it will make $$$. But I don't think it will make enough so ...take out all the Drama, throw in some guy in a cool Super Hero suit and I'll be driving Eco-Friendly BMWs for the rest of my life""..oh ya, I DO think this Movie is pretty cool :)"
4,4.5 stars,"The best means of describing this recording by this 70's Italian outfit would be to think of PFM's Jet Lag with it's prog meets jazz-fusion leaning's replace Bernardo Lanzetti on vocals with a Franco Mussida(PFM's original vocalist)sounding singer, add a touch of Duke-era Zappa and you've just about got it. The line-up consists of Guitar, Keyboard, Sax, Violin, Bass and Drums. This recording is mostly instrumental with just the occassional vocal (in Italian). These guys were really stellar musicians but thankfully never overplayed. The emphasis is clearly on the compositions and arrangements. This difficult to find obscure recording is well worth adding to your prog-rock collection. Highly recommended...Simon"
5,new edition available of this oldie but goodie,"this is a great cookbook, but the new edition was printed in 1998, and that one is probably better for today's 'waves.Microwave Gourmet"
5,Perfect entertainment for the young set!,"This was the very first Disney movie I purchased for my son. Along the way, there were many, many more! This one has a special place in my heart, so of course when my son had HIS son the very first movie I bought him was this! Lots of cute sing-a-long songs in this one."
3,Doesn't work in our car...,This is a great story and the old cartoon I loved...I bought it for our daughter to watch in the car for long rides. It does not work...only reason for 3 stars...
3,Classic Characters Given The Disney Approach,"If you have ever read A A Milne's books, you would wonder if these were the same characters. This is good family entertainment but the characterizations are not consistant with the original books. This also omits some good stories."
2,Too dramatic for my 3 year old...,"Although the content of this movie is realistic in that it shows a swarm of angry bees chazing Pooh, my 3 year old was scared and covered her eyes and then requested that it be turned off. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, but this is just a warning for other parents out there who may have more sensitive children. Granted, I'm very picky with what I let my kids watch and they aren't used to too much drama and TV stimulation. Maybe when they're a bit older it won't seem so scary and dramatic to them."
3,Recieved wrong video,"The movie is fine but we recieved ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"" rather than ""The Many adventures of winnie the pooh"""
1,VHS tape problem,"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh movie is back in the Disney ""vault""; ie. unavailable for a few years. We purchased this VHS edition that is older, but supposed to be new. Unfortunately it has the blips through the first (and in my opinion cutest) adventure. VHS tapes can wear out from use or heat. DVDs can scratch. We need an inventor to think of a new storage media.No problems with shipping - just defective product."
1,Good cartoon - Outrageous price = Bad DVD,"I'm guessing the studio had all these glowing reviews put up on Amazon. It wouldn't be hard to do. It is a fun hour, but not worth the cost. Why does Disney always have to gouge their audience? The DVD is not a good value, although, for about half of what they want it could worth buying.I say pass on this one..."
5,Christmas Present from the Past,"I got this for my daughter at 26 because I had fallen in love with it as a child. I am so glad that I did because she loved it too, and cried at a few of the scenes."
3,same as '96 VHS plus bonus,It literally took my ordering and then scanning the chapters to know for certain that this DVD contains the same material as the '96 VHS release. There are some bonus features too that I'm sure no one cares about. The original Pooh cartoons are BRILLIANT. I wanted to make sure that we were getting everything -it ends with 'Pooh and Christopher Robin say goodbye' and we do get it all...One curiosity. I wonder if Disney went back to the film for this transfer. I don't think they did. WTP deserves better! There's some minimal video 'tearing'. I do believe the image quality on the VHS is better. But format changes force us to re-purchase and we do.
5,This is a classic! My girls love it.,"I had this on VHS and when our player broke, we were unable to find a new one. My older daughter loved it and I wanted my younger daughter to see it too so I bought the DVD. They both love it and unlike all the Disney movies, nothing in this scares them. (They are 5.5 and 4)."
5,Good movie with quality DVD treatment,"(4.5/5 stars) In addition to a remastered and restored print with THX sound, there are some very good extras on this DVD. The movie itself is very good, though it drags on a bit. Also, the huffalump nightmare is bizarrely reminiscent of Dr. Seuss cartoons and is out of place in this film. Even the accompanying song sounds like one that would be in a Dr. Seuss cartoon. Otherwise, this one has a good amount of charm to it. Of course, it helps when the source material is superior, as the A.A. Milne books clearly are. Nonetheless, the artistic rendering and the actor's voices are indelibly linked with these characters, meaning Disney struck all the right chords when it brought these stories to the screen."
1,Region 2!!,The fact that its unplayable on standard US devices should be made more obvious. Tried to convert it to a playable format but only have a shiny Frisbee to show for it all.
5,The Classic Winnie the Pooh movie,Love that this movie is on DVD!! Me and my daughter watch it over and over again ALL DAY LONG! :) love the bonus features as well!
5,Winnie the Pooh,My children grew up with this video (VHS) and I wanted to share it with my grandson...very pleased to find it and it arrived in plenty of time for his first birthday!
5,Great!,"Arrived on time for Christmas and is in great condition. My son really loves it, and so does my husband."
5,ULTIMATE CLASSIC,"SEARCH HIGH AND LOW!!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT, cousins love to borrow it, great buy all ages love Winnie the Pooh!!!"
5,Perfect present,My nephew turned 2 and this was exactly what he had wanted. Great for kids who enjoy building sets and a bit of crafts. This will be his second set and he plays with it hour after hour and so on.
4,Lincoln logs AGAIN!!,"This was for my granddaughter and her new brother, but I guess my daughter and son-in-law had lots of fun with it before they wrapped it and put it under the Christmas tree. Brought back memories"
2,Not enough peices,"I was disappointed with this toy because there were not enough of the larger logs, and, I believe, there is a limited amount of structures for a child to make. It was purchased for a five-year-old, and based on one of the reviews I had read, I decided that the larger set in the box would be too large and heavy for him to handle, so I opted for this set."
5,Great classic toy!,"My children have been wanting a large set of Lincoln Logs for a couple of years, so I got the tin this last Christmas. They play with it all year long and have a great time building and playing together. This is a great toy for the imagination. They love to use their Little Pet Shop animals inside for make-believe play."
3,Stars are great.. Amazon packaging.. not so much,"5 stars for the paint. 3 stars for the packaging.I love All Stars.. I shoot them exclusivly. recently I have had 1-7 ball breaks per bag (4bags per case).Plenty of packaging padding is included with each order... but for some reason they only put it on top of the box. Why? oh Why?Sooo easy to fix... just put some on top, bottom, and the sides... then no more broken balls."
2,Gotta consider delivery,"To be honest I have no clue how these will work. If they were dry and unbroken and not sitting in a huge glop at the bottom of the bag, well maybe. Every one of the four bags had massive breaks. The box was only half hazardly protected and it was clear that Fed Ex had sent this box through the ringer. Ive cleaned up what I could and threw out probably 500 balls...the glops of paint were that huge. My feeling now after doing this is to make sure there are as few middle men between me and the manufacturer as possible and try to find someone that ships. I suspect you might be better off choosing to not go the free shipping route. Maybe then you can get Fed Ex out of the mix."
1,Very Bad Product,"When i got the balls, everyone of the 4 bags had breaks. I hand cleaned every ball, about 1800) left. When I tried to shoot them, I could get 1 or 2 balls off then the rest would break in the barrel. I tried lowing my marker pressure and other balls. The problem is these all star balls, probably because they were broken or old. I have a Bob Long marker and keep it in good condition. This was the first and last time I order balls off the internet."
1,Wrong Paintballs!,"It is actually impossible for me to review this product because Amazon.com sent me Evil paintballs instead of the RPS All Stars that I ordered :( I will however, write a review of the paintballs that I did receive. The paint came with at least twenty breaks in each of the four bags in the case (no warranty on paint). I tried to clean them and use them for practice paint but, every other ball would break. I was forced to throw them away. They were on sale for $[...] and shipped directly from Amazon. I should have just burned the money instead. Shame on you Amazon! First, you send me the wrong product, and then I open the box and find that it's all ruined. Until this purchase, I have had nothing but good luck with Amazon. I will never buy paint from you again. So, based on this review I would not recommend buying any kind of paint from Amazon.com."
2,I gave it two stars cause I think the idea is cool.,"Unfortunately there was way to many problems with this thing to have made it worth the effort and cost.First of all, the tubes are very very stiff which made it a pain to put together. Impossible, no, but annoying YES! A toy should never be too big of a pain for the adults in my opinion.Second, The smoke liquid AND the bubble solution were BOTH only half full! They were greasy on the outside as if they had leaked. Nothing else was greasy which makes me wonder if they were already like that before being packaged.And last, after the annoyance of putting the darn thing together, ours didn't work!Our experience with this thing was simply bad. I might have exchanged it for a new one if not for the first two issues. I just didn't want to deal with it again."
2,not so good,"Against the odds, I purchased it. The tubes are getting stiff (has it been in the box too long?) so, I don't think the bubble solution was moving around too well. I have to really sit and work it over with an ""engineer's"" mind to see how I can make it really work. There was just a little bottle of bubbles, but those are readily available. It mostly looks neater that it ends up being."
1,Bubble Blowing Away Your Money,"What a waste of time and money. It doesn't work and the instructions are horrible. I can only guess that they were written by nonEnglish speakers as they are unintelligible. We never saw any smoke and the bubbles ended up being made by hand with the wand instead of with the machine. Anyone know what the ""wall"" is? We spent an hour trying to figure that part out. Stick with the little bottles and wands that you buy in drug stores for 10 cents. They are far superior!!"
1,Horrible Disappointment,"This was purchased for my 7 year who loves everything to do with science and of course bubbles! The square bubble was a joke, the smoke didn't work, the solution was to thick to move through the tube, bubbles in a bubble didn't work. Overall I would not recommend this kit and I regret purchasing it since it disappointed my budding scientist so much!"
1,Terrible Product,Absolutly terrible product nothing worked. I would not recommend this product. One star is too high of a rating
1,Absurdly Poorly Made,"What a piece of junk. My son was so excited about this toy. It was the first thing we got into on Xmas day. The valve did not work properly and the bubble goo never made it into the chamber. Like an idiot, I gave the product another shot. (Kudos to Amazon who got me a replacement by the 31st!) Same thing. The product you pay for is essentially just a neat idea, not an actual working product. Shame on them indeed."
1,Remains a Mystery,"I purchased this toy for my grandson, a clever 9 year old - who asked me to help him assemble and operate it. The assembly instructions are worse than awful. The step by step instructions are a series of B&W postage stamp sized, fuzzy photos. Impossible to use as a guide. As a last resort, I consulted the box cover and an included fold-out. No luck as the configuration pictured was not the configuration of the toy. Do not waste your money on this one unless, of course, you want to purchase several hours of frustration. In that case, this is the product for you."
1,A real bubble BUSTER,"This product taught my children the valuable lesson. Don't judge a book by its cover. This item looked ""neat and cool"", but was really disappointing and frustrating. A literal bubble ""buster""."
1,bad choice,This toy was difficult to set up and we were not able to make it work for more than a minute at a time. I would not recommend it.
1,Too Good To Be True! Very Much Dissappointed!,"If you must purchase this item for your ""gotta-have-it"" ""nothin-else-will-do"" child, then please have these items on hand. A bottle of dishwashing liquid or classic blowing bubbles, a bubble wand, and a small bowl or cup. And anything that smokes. (Gramps with his stinking cigar will do). When your child discovers this item does not work like the video, nor is it's performance even close you will need some backup. My son had more fun, ceased his heartbroken tears, and livened gramps up by blowing bubbles at gramps smoke rings."
1,Misleading Advertising,"Terrible, terrible. I am a research engineer and have used laboratory equipment for 30 years. I purchased this for my 8 year old daughter after she saw an ad on TV showing how wonderful it was. The assembly was not difficult however the bubble solution bottle was less than half full as was the smoke solution. The quality of the bubbles was considerably less than what you could make from a dime store bottle and the bubble generator itself was unnecessarily complicated and performed poorly. The ""smoke"" solution is supposed to make smoke when heated in the internal chamber of the smoke generator. The smoke was less visible than the steam coming off a cup of warm coffee. The video ad for this product is absolutely false and misleading. My daughter and I both felt decieved. I will return this product and get my money back. What a disappointment for a child that is enthusiatic for science toy."
1,What bubbles?,"The product was not difficult to assemble, but nothing worked! We had to manually put some bubble solution on the bubble blower and even then it only produced a medium sized bubble. The little cup that was supposed to feed the solution to the blower never worked. There is a tube that connects the two parts, but the bubble solution doesn't flow through it, even when the valve is open. The smoke generator doesn't work either. I followed the directions carefully and tried several times. I bought this toy a couple of months ago on Amazon, but my son just opened it yesterday for Christmas. I hope Amazon will still take it back!"
1,diabolical junk,"This was the most incredibly time-wasting, useless piece of junk that I have ever encountered. Horrible design: Grandaddy (who has a Ph.D. in science) spent hours struggling to get it to work. Never did. Tubes were bent and occluded, so we could not get the fluid into the chamber, precluding any use of the elaborate set up that might or might not have produced some interesting effects. Shame on Mad Science for marketing this abomination.Sad grandad"
1,Do not waste your time or money.,Piece of crap. Never once got it working right. It went to the recycling center... hopefully something worthwhile can be gotten from the cast-off plastic.
2,"Eh,not exactly an easy thing to use.","When I first saw this I thought it would be great for our 8yr old. I was wrong. It's complicated,frustrating to get to work right even for an adult. The directions were hit or miss on some of the finer details on how to produce the bubbles. The plastic used to make this also has a distinct (and my wife says ""Unpleasent"") scent. The smoke liquid to create the smoke effect is not to be used by children. Another point I would have liked to have known before buying this. I ran under the assumption it was a non-toxic,fairly easy to use toy going by the age on the package and just the concept itself. What's easier than making a bubble? I only wish getting this toy to make bubbles was as easy."
5,"excellent , practical, logical how to book on Photoshop","I have used many Photoshop ""how to"" books and while many are helpful, some get so complex in their explanations that your eyes glass over. As any photoshop user knows there are many ways to do the same thing in photoshop. This book however seems to have found the easier and logical way in most instances. He uses layers and fills extensively and burns back what is not wanted. By the end of the book I was comfortable assessing the pictures and guessing how he would do the changes. While he sticks with outdoor photography most tips are applicable to any photography. ""Outdoor Photographer Landscape and Nature Photography"" is A PHOTOGRAPHER'S GUIDE to photoshop not a photoshop guru's guide to photoshop applications to photography. The Pro Tips through out were an extra"
5,Excellent Book,"Overall I'm quite satisfied with this book. I like the way the author compares working in Photoshop with the way Ansel Adams worked in the darkroom. I had always considered 'Photoshopping' a picture in a negative light, and the descriptions and examples in this book completely changed my opinion. The techniques described are really nothing more than the digital equivalent of what master photographers have done with film for years. The book has excellent examples of how to get the most out of any digital image."
1,Flamboyantly fu*cking misinformed.,"Hey, Elio... you're wrong on two counts: The Scissor Sisters are a novelty band (not hot), and they aren't British. You are flamboyantly fu*cking misinformed."
3,Flamboyantly Flat,"Another boring single from PSB and guess what? sounds like everything else they've ever released!The only reason I bought CD2 was for the remixes.Tomcraft mix was O.K, nothing special or NEW, but I absolutely loved the Scissor Sisters mix, whom I think are the hottest band to come out of the U.K in the past year...."
1,Kelly is the star of this movie!,"This is one of the worst movies ever. This film deserves to be rated G. Ok it has a bit of gay sex, but there is only one scene where you can actually see full frontal nudity for 5 seconds and the sex scene is in the dark.The acting is even worse...it couldn't have been worse!The real star is Kelly Clarkson who plays a drunk party girl for 10 seconds!I'd recommned it for nobody! Except maybe obsessive fans of Kelly!"
2,not what you think,"Although this version shows Ronstadt and Klein, the production in substandard. This is not the version you've seen in the theatre or on tv. That one costs $60. I kept it, but it's not the one I wanted."
3,Experiences along the way,"A fun, quick read, but not allot of explanation on how to achieve the same results."
4,excellent,"Barry White is a pure musical genius. The Maestro has shown us that he doesn't have to necessarily sing anything but to have his Orchestra play for him will still set the mood off right. One of my favorite cuts on the album is Can't You See. His music just flows along and you can just ""feel the emotion"" running straight through you. There is another cut on the CD that a rap group sampled. The Theme from the Together Brothers was sampled for C'mon Ride the Train for the 69 Boyz. Just goes to show you that the music of today is not much creative than it was back then. I wish there were more notable cuts from the Orchestra that was not on this particular CD. But however, this is a MUST BUY for a Barry White fan. Magnifico!!"
4,surprises galore,"I bought this CD for one tune, ""Love's Theme,"" that is played a lot on the radio. I adore this tune. I was totally unfamiliar with all the others. After listening to the whole CD, there are 2 other tunes I discovered I adore. The rest is rhythm, rhythm with no real melody. I was disappointed. I love ""Love's Theme"" because of the rhythm layered on top with a lush melody. Much to my surprise, ""Theme from King Kong"" is like that as well, with even more emotional appeal. It starts off for about 1-2 minutes with just rhythm, then is elevated to the skies with a FABULOUS melody on top. It is AWE-SOME! That tune alone along with ""Love's Theme"" makes this CD worth buying. I also very much like ""Let the Music Play,"" though it sounds close to an old disco tune, ""Native New Yorker."" I do recommend this CD if only for the 3 tunes I like. The rest I skip over."
3,"Is ""Loves Theme"" from a 1974 movie??","I am trying to find out if the track ""Loves Theme"" comes from a movie in the same year (Feb.1974) that this single reached No.10 on the British Pop Charts, and stayed for 3 weeks.I really enjoy the arrangement of this melody which is my favourite disco tune of that era,next to the ""Saturday Night Fever""album."
1,It Really Didn't Take Much,"It really didn't take much to entertain me when I was a kid. I even liked Godzilla movies. When Ed Wood films turned up in the pages of Famous Monsters of Filmland, I took them seriously.But I also remember MESA OF LOST WOMEN, a movie so bad that my eyes were actually opened to just how horrible some movies could be. And that I might be wasting my time--even watching Chiller Theatre.It's not that this movie got me to grow up, but I definitely wanted to see something good afterward....(The shame is that there are still so many good--and great--movies that you can't find on DVD!)"
1,I laughed so hard I broke a rib,"This has to be the greatest degree of ineptitude the film world has ever seen!Stars Jackie Coogan as a mad scientist who injects women with ""spider juices.""The soundtrack consists of the same 3 chords on a Spanish guitar over and over again. A group of travelers crash their plane into a mesa in the desert and are help captive by Coogan and his spider-women-things.The film is so bad you will have difiiculty following the plot...or is there one?This truly could be considered the biggest honker of all time, right up there with ""The Giant Claw."" If you have money to burn, buy this video and laugh your socks of!"
1,"alas, not campy great, funny, or in the slightest interesting","I have been on a binge of c-grade scifi flicks of the 50s/60s, and I barely got thru this one. Indeed, it was so ridiculously bad that I don't think I am going to return to this genre for a number of years. Jackie Coogan was what attracted me to this and I was hoping to find an old gem with some ideas, interesting monsters, and the inadvertent laughs one expects from such films. But there was nothing appealing in the film, from the truly awful acting to the dull, cheap prop of a monster. The story line, unsurprisingly, was utterly unoriginal.Not recommended."
3,Entertaining and watchable,"Tandra Quinn (former ""Perfect Baby of America"")makes this movie. What a great combination of brains, beauty, and tarantula instincts! The many strange head-shots of grinning dwarfs are also endearing."
1,Funniest dance sequence ever!,"This ridiculous movie is so bad you just sit and shake your head. There is a ""dance"" scene in a ""cantina"" that is so horrific you are embarrassed for the actress. There are also numerous politically uncorrect references, including characters named ""Wu"" and ""Pepe."" Buy for laughs only!"
4,"Oh, yeah - Film's a collaborative art...","Fans of astounding cinema will enjoy this movie, since it plays like a lost Ed Wood film. Ron Ormond took an unfinished movie started by Herbert Tevos, and tried to finish it with minimal effort - the story is presented as a flashback via a minor character who couldn't possibly know the story, continuity errors and overripe dialogue abound. Jackie Coogan (!) plays a mad scientist who is creating giant spider puppets and then turning them either into knock-out women or leering dwarves. An incredibly odd movie."
3,Hard to Follow,"I like the price, but this book is really only good for looking up things that you already understand. I certainly was not able to understand what an XML entity is from this book."
1,Yawn....,"Julia Spencer-Fleming's two wonderful novels inspired me to seek out other ecclesiastical (yes, I used Spell-check on that one) heroines. Blake doesn't come close. I waded through the first, and have just given up entirely on the second, having gotten good and sick of the protagonist's negativity and whining. I don't require relentless optimism from my heroines, but honestly, who would want to spend time with someone this incessantly down in the dumps? And it's not as though she has a compelling-enough back-story to carry one along on a wave of sympathy. There's nothing for it but to keep waiting for Spencer-Fleming to finish her next novel - let us pray that this happens soon."
1,"Sad, Slow, Boring!","What a sad, slow, boring book! I couldn't care about any of the characters. A plodding book, with a rabbit out of the hat ending. Alot of nasty anti-Catholic bias throughout, which is ironic given the anti-Semitism plot line. One of the few books I've thrown away, but it was better than subjecting someone else to this misery."
1,Woodside Table,"Product was damaged, took over two weeks to receive it. Couldn't be bothered with the hassle to return it."
4,Good Tool Bag,"This is a great bag for carrying just about anything you'll need on the jobsite, workshop, etc. There is plenty of usable space with lots and lots of pockets. It's made from good, sturdy material."
1,Design Flaw Tool Bag,"After filling bag with tools it will not stay upright due to the lower opening,the velcro will not hold the bag upright.This bag full is useless."
2,There are only two tool bags worth considering,"The Veto Pro Pak and the Lee Valley canvas tool bags...The Veto is the Cadillac of tool bags, nay Mercedes. The Lee Valley Bags are Lexus/Toyotas"
5,works on a Freud 2000,"Only has two screws to hold to the freud. I pulled off the baseplate and attached the jig. Held solid. I use it with a 1/4"" up spiral bit.I used it to put in floor recepticles in hardwood floors. Worked great, and the setup is very easy. I know it's plastic, and you probably need to accept that it's a semi consumable item, but so far it's holding up fine, and the holes are cleaner than a hole saw, and I would say, just as round if not better.As with any jig, you do need to take a few passes through scrap to get the feel of it. The closer to perpendicular you can get the pin, the better, but it's not rocket science."
4,Not recommended for use with Hitachi M12V,"I mounted the Jig to my Hitachi M12V and found only two screw holes which line up! This lets the jig move when using it, changing the dimensions of the cutout by 1/8"" or so."
5,Great Router Accessory!,"Not much more that I can add to the other reviews here! This is a great router attachment for routing out recessed areas and holes for speaker builds or anything else that you can think of. It is accurate and attaches easily to router models it is intended for! I also have the Jasper 400T Model 400 for smaller holes as well and it is just as accurate as its bigger cousin. If your routing holes under 2"" the Model 400 is required as the 200 won't go down that far! Nice Products For Sure! Purchased from Amazon with two day delivery and nice packaging. THANKS AMAZON!!!!"
3,Great product but breaks easy,As another user said this is an awesome product but the holes that are used to screw it to the router break easy. I guess you can try to be careful but I think it's just too thin in those areas.
4,Router jig Jasper 200J,This is a time saver and I should have purchased it long ago. The only problem is the 1/4 inch bit restriction to assure accuracy of the template. With a little experimentation I hope to over come the 1/4 inch bit restriction and use 1/2 inch bits with an offset in the hole matrix.
4,sososojourn,"Indispensable if you cut a lot of circles as for speaker building. Easy to use. Best if you can leave it on a dedicated router as installation requires you to chuck up a setup pin (don't lose this or your in deep dodo) to ensure that the bit you use is centered on the jig (kind of a pain but necessary.) The adjustments are every 1/16"" so any finer than that just wont happen with this unless you use a larger bit than the standard recommended (1/4"" straight); otherwise some calculations are needed (given with the kit) to get the overall diameter of the hole you are cutting. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the guide pin is a little long for using in 3/4"" wood. Probably ok for 1"" (which is the best for speaker building anyway)."
4,circling up,"We like this jig a lot, but the numbers are on the wrong side. When the base is attached to the router, we have to turn it upside down to see them."
3,a good history of the PAST,"I had to read this book for school. It was okay as a history of a very misconcieved topic. Frankly, after reading Noam Chomsky's New Horizons in the Study of Language and Mind, Palmer's book is (I believe) mostly beside the point. But when compared to other intro books on ""hermeneutics"" it's probably as good as any, maybe a bit dated. Still, the language is clear enough to understand (a sign of it's out datedness). If your interested in langauge pick up The Cambridge Companion to Chomsky."
4,Big and usable,The plate is huge and very usable for parties and get togethers. It's not nearly as pretty as the other pieces in the set though. The face on the plate looks a little smudgy. I would buy it again though for its functionality.
1,Very contradictory! Mentions plenty of problems&no solutions,"The writings kept contradicting themselves throughout the book. She mentions many common problems but offers either no solutions or impossible ones. For example, in the kitchen, the stove and refrigerator should not face each other and her solution is to place a cabinet in between them. Really! Where from? Hanging from the ceiling? I was also intrigued about the fact that she mentions not to have open bookshelves with books on them. These are ""pointed blades"" constantly coming at you. Of course she offers no solution so I e-mailed her to see what ideas she could come up with following the Feng Shui philosophy and she rather rudely responded: ""hey if open shelves bother you then close them up with doors or something..."" Well, Ms Too, if that's your best shot, I can hardly recommend your book, can I?"
2,IMPOSSIBLE!!,Im tired from moving things from place to place!! i can't follow the book!! i JUST wanted to give up Feng Shui after i read it.. I realized that im throwing my life away because of where i lived and i just can't place plants all over.
1,Should be Titled : How to Repeat the Same Thing to Make $$,"Don't waste money , if you have read her 1 or 2 books earlier. I bought 4 last year but learned nothing new , so returning this one ."
2,Tiresome,"Could not finish. Got tired of plodding through the thing. Good idea but, really, let's get on with it. Gave up."
5,A great Sci-Fi book!,"After a long series of disappointments, this is the first really good Sci-Fi book I have read in a long while! Great characters that are well developed as well as a subtle and rich plot line. Great detail in the science and just the right amount of action. This book/author seems to be grouped with military sci-fi (which I don't like) a lot but I would not consider this book military sci-fi at all. Much more like David Brin (one of my all time favorites) or CJ Cherryh than Heinlein. All in all I was very pleased by this book and look forward to reading it's sequel when it comes out. Until then I have decided to read some of this author's earlier works, which I have been told are almost equally as good."
4,Good Sci Fi,I really enjoyed this book. I dont read as much science fiction as a used to and this was a good blend of technology and sci-fi. There wasnt so much detail as to make it a hard read but there was enough detail to make for an interesting and plausible story.
2,Disappointing,"The process of reading this book seemed much longer than it actually was. The parts of the book that actually deal with plot progression are few and far between, and we are mostly relegated to reading the conversations of a group of completely uninteresting people, exemplified by the sterile narrator Tyler Dupree, who is one of the least engaging characters in fiction. Unfortunately 90% of the contents of this book have no effect on the plot and the book suffers from it, as well as having one of the main characters, Diane, having absolutely no reason for inclusion except to pad the page count. All that aside, their are many interesting concepts and ideas to be found in Spin, it's just a shame that you have to slog through the whole book to get to them."
2,Another great premise - spins itself to nowhere.,"I love a unique sci-fi premise. This one delivers that in spades. And, it's the premise and the pursuit of understanding what's occurred and how it will be resolved that kept me reading (ocassionally through what could only be generously called ""some very convoluted writing"").Ultimately, though, this book just failed to deliver on the great premise. The ending is one, that as it approached, I found myself counting pages - wondering how the situation could be explained and resolved in any sort of meaningful way with so little left to read. The answer was simple, it wasn't going to be.BOTTOM LINE: Even for unique sci-fi premise fans, I'd look elsewhere first - or just read it with low expectations of the outcome."
3,An Imaginative But Poorly Written Novel,"You're not given time to connect with the characters, the English is poor, the plot tepid. It is imaginative, don't get me wrong, but that's not all there is to good science fiction. If you're in search of good writing or characters you can love (or that even have a discernable goal or desire), look somewhere else."
4,Engaging Story,"To sum up; Spin is a quick read with an engaging story. Not hard sci-fi, this story about how humanity would react to a mysterious astronomical event offers intriguing ideas and strong character development."
4,Love story disguised as a SF novel,"Not one of my favorite Hugo Award winners, but still pretty good. Not often you get a genuine love story and hard sci-fi in the same book. I just wished it would have been longer, just so the author would have better fleshed out the budding love story and told us more of the mars experience during the spin . But overall, good stuff."
4,Spin.. a tale,"Wilson does a nice job of sort of throwing a mysterious quandary into normal reality and then showing how it affects humanity. There are things I would expect to happen if the earth suddenly were to become surrounded by such a shield, and Wilson hit most of them, which was satisfying, as often authors will leave out apparently obvious repercussions. However, there wasn't anything _really_ surprising about what happened, so while the story was enjoyable, it wasn't a complete page-turner. I also wished he had flushed out the end explanation with a little more detail."
4,Slow But Interesting,"The first 100 pages of this book were slow, but once I made it through them, the story picked up and moved to an interesting ending. I believe the author could have written this story in about half the number of pages used."
1,Spin the get to sleep book,"I say many great reviews for SPIN so I decided to download it to my Kindle, I am not sure, if anyone really read this book. I found it slow not well formatted, not going anywhere. I would recommend anything but this book unless you what a book that will help you get to sleep and put-down you kindle."
2,Good idea doesn't mean good story,"I like the premise... but this book is not entertaining. Sure.. it will scratch your brain but where is the fun?It's not worth the hardcover price and honestly, I wouldn't waste time borrowing it from a public library.ONCE AGAIN... GOOD IDEA BUT BORING STORYLINE. GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT BUT NOT ENTERTAINING AT ALL. SKIP THIS ONE."
1,Can't Beleive I Finished it!,"I don't understand the glowing reviews. Interesting start. Slowed in the middle and then the ""I ran out of ideas"" ending."
3,"Good, but little science fiction","This is a good, if extremely slow paced, novel. There isn't much science in this science fiction book, though. The story is about a brother, a sister and their closest friend, growing up in very unusual times. It is interesting and told well, with good development of the main characters. But the science fiction part is little more than background for most of the book, and then it's wrapped up quickly at the end, as if it were an afterthought. Trust me, I wasn't looking for a shoot 'em up, blow 'em up novel, but the relevance of the sci-phi aspect here is truly minimal."
2,Don't waste your time,"Tedious with two-dimensional, predictable charaters.Raises some interesting Sci-Fi ideas and does nothing with them.Ending is trite and unimaginative."
3,Great Ideas!,"This is a book about fascinating ideas: Von Neumann machines, disparate human development imposed by a time warp, unknown aliens (they stay that way), bio engineering etc...This books is packed full of these kinds of nuggets. However as an engaging story it is a slog fest. My three stars is based on ideas, not story telling.This is the story of Jason, Diane and Tyler. Tyler is in love with Diane. Diane married Simon, and Jason is Diane's genius brother. The story is told from Tyler's perspective. Great, but we are talking about ideas that encompass all of humanity. Turning this into a love story that smothers the hard science being presented just slows everything down."
3,narrator being not-quite-main character gives interesting perspective,"The interesting concept of this time-travel book is that the entire Earth is time traveling. (I always wondered about the Earth being quarantined by some outside force.) Again, like inThe Chronoliths, the narrator is a character just off-center from the people most deeply involved in the major plot points - he is a quasi-outsider, giving his perspective as ""one of us"" with a little bit of an inside track to give a more rounded (but not purely hero's) perspective to the events.This is more of a ""hard sci-fi"" with some complex concepts. As such, this is an interesting read, but due to the heavy sci-fi concepts and small amount of humor or amusement, some may not find it to be ""fun"" reading."
2,"Good character development, boring story","I recently received the book, and all books I get I read at least 100 pages to see if the story captivates me. I know some stories are slow to develop, that's why I give them 100 pages. Wilson did a fine job at building the character's persona's, hence the 2 star rating, but the story was ineffective at best, totally boring at worst. You can have the most interesting character, but if you have a sloppy story, the whole plot will fail. Like Superman, comic fans all love him, but say you put him in May berry with Aunt Bea and Sher riff Andy, well then, it'll flop as Superman has nobody to challenge him. But I give this author a C for effort."
4,"Excellent hard SF, false notes in character development","Rest assured, this is an enjoyable thought provoking read with some interesting variations on old SF themes. However, perhaps in response to the oft-repeated canard about character development, the author strains too mightily for interpersonal themes and character development. Not that there is anything wrong with well worked out characters with well worked out social spheres but this author does not pull it off transparently. Instead, you get the sense all along this book of these additional themes being contrived and forced into the narrative. As a result in the third quarter of the novel the pace really fell off and I found myself having to push on because I hoped there would be an interesting payoff in the last quarter. Fortunately, I was not disappointed and nor will you be."
2,Should have been a short story,"Reading this book I kept asking myself when it would end. It has an interesting premise, good concepts, but should maybe have been a novella or short story. The characters are flat, amazingly predictable and the plot grinds along at a glacier's pace. I do not typically get angry at books, but this one really irritated me."
3,reading of the SPIN,"good sci-fi story characters are well developed, I found the story line different and unique. I will read other stories from this author."
4,Excellent Science Fiction yarn.,"Although the last two books of this trilogy didnt quite stand up to the first, thats no reason not to read this story. Strong characters, great protaganist (The Shield)and very well paced. This is worth a good read, strong science fiction indeed."
2,Nothing great here,"This book would have made a great short story but in its current form it is too long and boring. The intermixing of protagonists running from the 'officials' and the main story line was pointless. It did not advance the story while it ate up page after page. Plus, if you are running from the law why take a drug that will debilitate you for two weeks? Also, the sub-plot of religious nut jobs trying to breed a red heifer was a waste of ink. At the end I was waiting for the big pay off with regard to the origin of the spin membrane, instead human kind is given a new planet to trash without learning any lessons about how to take care of dwindling resources."
3,MANOR HOUSE,"This was not what we had expected and we don't believe that the description was adequate. However, the historical content and interaction between the people in the movie is interesting."
5,A perfect example of feckless modern day youth.,"After seeing Part 1: A fascinating programme that illustrates how utterly useless and bone idle modern day ""oiks"" are. Perhaps they had little or no briefing on what to expect as servants, but most of them showed an appalling disrespect for authority, laziness, lack of manners and an inability to articulate anything sensible. Our reaction was ""they just don't get it."" As for those pathetic girls complaining ""I really miss my boyfriend,"" and ""I really miss my mum"" etc. - absolutely sickening. What a wretched, gutless generation have we raised? Would you employ any of them (with a few exceptions) in anything other than menial tasks? The French Chef was the only one to show any backbone. No wonder Britain imports so many foreigners to do the jobs available, whilst the indigenous benefit scroungers idle their lives away, boozing it up and complaining about their lot in life. Aaarrrgggghh!"
1,disliked,I though it was a movie but it is a documentary about the movie Manor House which is not what I wanted to purchase.
1,"Good concept, poor players","In comparison with the real (created) scenario of 20th century players in another century like Colonial and Frontier Houses where, even though their contempory frustrations came through, that is ALL this is about. The whining mother on 1900 House ruined that production; all the upstairs gentry, while taking every advantage of the limited luxury they enjoyed, spent their time bitching and treating below stairs with the entitlement mentality of trust fund babies on steriods. The below stairs folks were more credible, though clueless as to what was expected of them by way of the unending toil they'd signed up for . Doesn't anyone screen these people ?"
4,Come to the insular and class driven world of...,"I admit, I am a PBS/BBC House series junkie. After Colonial House, this is my 2nd favorite House series so far. The personalities in this series are memorable. The situation and feelings were vivid and I had no troubles understanding why the conflicts came up between the wealthy family and the servants in the Manor House. Like other items in the house series, this is mostly serious business with only a few bits of joy mixed in.Let Manor House transport you to another time and place for hours and hours. Then be glad you get to take the DVD out and live in the here and now!"
5,Eye opener series,"This starts a bit slow as you meet the characters but stick with it and you'll appreciate the life you've been given. The differences between classes and the days that the servants put in will astound you. Did you know one servant was a hall boy(actually had to sleep in the hall) and was at everyone's beck and call, that the scullery maid did nothing but scrub pots and pans sixteen hours a day? Anyway it's a good series to see life as it was and how much better we have it today."
3,"Cute, fun product","This is typical of other magnetic toys, except the amount of beads is lacking. As cheap as beads are, they could have tripled the amount and it would have been much more enjoyable and been much more worth it."

5,An instant classic,"This is a stunning collaboration, featuring a stack of tunes that are *all* potential favourites - that is, every one is like that track you wait for, that one you immediately want to hear again. Eerie atmostpheric backing vocals (e.g. on Dance of the Bad Angels) add a unique sound, as does Butler's twisted guitar. This has everything - lyrics, melody, and that indefinable quality 'class'. Hard to imagine anyone not becoming addicted after a few play-throughs."
3,Great book for beginning fantasy writers...,"This book has a lot of practical information for the beginning fantasy author to get inspired, get motivated, and get writing. Lots of introductory principles to learn and apply, and great examples from popular pieces of literature. More targeted at younger readers referencing mainly well known and young adult titles, it can still be a benefit for beginning fantasy writers of any age."
5,We need more people like Mary Bateson...,"Great understandings, Mary has. A book about learning through cultures, other people, your own experiences. I am trying to read 100 books in a year. Of the 65ish I have read so far... this book is in the top three! Get it, read it, enjoy!"
5,This album is the goods.,"No less than Otis Redding declared this the bible of Southern Soul. Who are we to argue?BTW, Hip-O Select is reissuing this. $20. On their website."
5,Just saw him live!!!,"I just had the privilege of seeing Howard Tate on Saturday, February 22, 2003, at the House of Blues, in Cambridge, Ma. He sounded awsome to the completely packed and soldout house. He did a good set from the two cd's listed here and also from his forthcoming one called ""Rediscovered"". The band included the great Al Kooper on keyboards. The highlight for me was meeting both Howard Tate and Jerry Ragovoy and having them sign the cd I am reviewing now. This cd rocks so if you can, get it."
2,Ok for camping - Not for beach!,"This canopy has served us well for camping in the mountains, but just can't handle the constant 15 mph winds on the beach. I used it until it failed. The side cross members flex and the leading leg in the wind bends until it can't take it no more. I'm looking for replacement parts, and have found that the cost looks like more than it's worth. I purchased a Wal-Mart replacement while at the beach, and it is an EZ up, and is of the same design and won't hold up either. In my quest for replacement parts, I have found that there is a much sturdier design frame out there made by Northstar, Ez Up Encore and a few others that I am considering in the future."
1,This is a terrible product,"We bought this canopy to use for tailgating at sporting events and backyard shade for gatherings. We only used it 3 times and the nylon roller bag that came with it completely fell apart. Then one of the structure tubes in the canopy bent so the thing was useless. We were very careful setting this up and taking it down and still have no idea how the tube got bent. We never forced it open or shut. I contacted Variflex through their Quik Shade product web site and filled out a warranty claim to see if I could get a replacement part (they claim you can). I got an automated reply saying I would be contacted in 24 hrs and never heard a thing. Do not buy this product. Try the EZ Up brand instead, we found out it is a much better product at a similar price."
2,Breaks too quickly,"Nice shade except for durability. Being in FL the canopy does a nice job blocking the heat, taking it up/down requires more than one person. The stinker here is that a connection bolt fixture broke and the bolt was lost, cost a chunk to order replacements. Not long after one of the metal arms snapped in 2 at a connection point. I find myself looking for a new one, better built, than sinking more cash into what looks like a neverending repair job. And oh yeah, the bag is handy, just expect it to rip within short order...duct tape helps"
1,Very Unhappy and Seeking Refund,"I was trying to save a little money so I went with the Variflex/Quick Shade brand. It ended up costing me a lot more because now I have to go out and purchase another more expensive canopy that will hold up under normal use. As for this product, the plastic holding the main crossbars across the top broke in two places by the time I had used the product 3 times (I think the first break happened the first day we used it). The 4th and last time I used the product, we had to tape the crossbars together in the middle so they wouldn't fall on our heads and the top of the canopy was flaccid and waving around in the wind.But that's not all... there's already a hole in the canopy fabric, the bag tore and the zipper came completely off. I contacted the company by email 2 days ago because there is a 2 year warranty, but I haven't had a response yet."
1,Tent fell apart during an Orlando quick rain shower,"Purchased Variflex Compact Recreational 10 x 10 Quik Shade Instant Canopy to use at my son's birthday party. The tent was easy to set up with my husband's assistance. However, the tent did not make it to the party. The tent did not even last 1/2 hour once it assembled.I live in Orlando. Unfortunately, we had a rain storm which blew in & out in less than 10 minutes. There was not enough time for us to close the tent down. The tent metal assembly poles & frame are not strong to withstand even a light rain storm. The poles and frame bent beyond repair and one area broke entirely. Luckily I had some beach umbrella's to put out for our guests, since it was hot in the 90's & sun came out right after the rain.I would not buy again. Looked like a great product, I was disappointed with how flimsy it really was once assembled."
1,The Bravo is NOT heavy duty,"After waiting for 6 weeks for the EZ-UP brand, I finally ordered the Bravo Canopy, based on the Description ""Heavy Duty Frame"". When I received the order, the box did not represent the item too well. Upon unpacking the canopy and putting it up, I find the frame is a thin walled, smaller tubing than the brands walmart, and kmart and lowes carry. Additionally, it was already flexing at the joint on the legs. It was CLEARLY not heavy duty at all. I am returning the item. I shopped every canopy I could find, and base on the manufacturers description I chose the most appropiate item for my purpose. I was very disappointed."
1,absolute crap,2nd time in use - some breezes at the beach - and the thing snapped in two places while one of the sides bent beyond repair. There were about 50 other tents on the beach and I kept watching to see if anyone else was having the trouble that we were - nope. Just us - Absoute piece of CRAP! Save your money because they won't replace it if it breaks...put these people out of business!
5,Still Bluesy after all these years,"Dave Snaker Ray has done it again with this CD - a full thirty plus years after his first album with Spider John Koerner and Tony Little Son Glover. While some of his more recent work has been with electric blues bands, this CD gets back to his original chops - country blues played well and sung well. His use of the six string and twelve string guitars continues to amaze, and his vocal strength and purity for the genre has not diminished at all over the years. Sitting on Top of the World is one of the best tracks to listen to through Amazon, and If It Looks Like Jelly rates all ten stars of the five star rating system. When he was starting out, all the old blues innovators were being rediscovered, and it is high time we celebrate his take on a rich American tradition."
4,pickup truck cargo bar,"This bar does what we need, it just isn't easy to use. For the price it is a good product and I have purchased three of them."
1,What kind of chain am I going to get?,"The first time I got this pendant from SilverSpeck, the chain was box chain type (better quality) and made the pendant look even prettier. I ended giving it as a gift to a friend and a week latter I made a second purchase for myself but this time the chain that was included was a rolo link chain type, very, very, very inexpensive looking, and makes the all set (chain & pendant) looks cheap. They should give more information about their product and describe better on the ""Product Descripiton"" that the chain they will send is what they have on stock and not what is on the picture.On top of every thing, when I did call SilverSpeck, the person that I spoke with was not friendly and if I can say, there was a bit of rude tone on his voice! I'll keep the pendant but will not purchase any more from this company and also next time it rains, I'll put it outside, so the water of the rain will whash away the bad Chi from that telephone call."
2,Not Enough Bang For The Buck,"I have read alot of martial arts books. While I am not claiming to be a ""martial artist"", I have tried, to reasonable extent, most of the proccesses and training in such books. In this one, the title is misleading. 1. It is targeted to boxers and from what I gathered, only boxers. 2. It isn't well written or interesting at all. I had a friend help me do the bean bag drill and I feel we wasted alot of time for nothing. Play dodge ball. It is way more physically demanding and fun. Games aside... I didn't care for this book. On my own part I would have to say I have never read any of the author's other books and dont know much about them. If this is a template for the other's, I will not waste the time, let alone the money. I would like to conclude that if you think that this book will warm you up for martial arts...it may but there are more, far better books for the same price if not less.(Fighting Power, Speed Training)"
2,Not as good as I expected it to be!!,I went for this game as it works natively in Mac OS X. I already had a copy of Bridge Baron 13 which was great but ran in Classic mode. Having tried both I would strongly recommend Bridge Baron. Better Play. Wider range of options. Much more learning. 3D Bridge has better graphics but it does not provide you with a better tool for learning or playing.I have subsequently bought a copy of Bridge Baron 14 which runs on Mac OS X. Fabulous software.
1,Ultra conservative bidding,Geez. Over and over after the bidding by your computer partner is done you find...we had a cold slam. This game is so terrible that I trashed it. I trashed it after seeing three small slams underbid. And my partner never responded correctly to cue leads. Yuk.
1,Solo...it stinks!,They should have spent more time learning the game instead of wasting it on graphics.
1,Annoying,"I like Fred videos online, and I enjoyed the television Fred movie (albeit I disliked its sequel, ""Night of the Living Fred""). However, I knew that both were stupid yet enjoyable, and this is a good television series to watch when nothing better (or more tolerable, considering the fact that I loathe many programs available today because of the superb quality possessed by programs available during the 1990s) is on, but the premise and jokes are a bit stupid. If they made Fred's character a bit smarter for the television series and made a few of the other characters just a tad more realistic (while still showing many hilariously eccentric qualities simultaneously) perhaps the series would be a bit better, but let's face it: Fred's home is the internet, not the television screen."
5,MsTelle,"This CD is a must have! Especially for those who have been in a relationship or two. Carol's voice is as Jill Scott says ""Chocolate Velvet."" It truly is Sweet, Rich and Smooth. Her range is incredible, and her personality is, as her voice. You must see her live, you WILL enjoy yourself immensley! She is by far a Classy yet Soultry Act."
3,Weak work in a superb streak,"One can hear the sound of Wonder wondering what he's doing when the goofball experimentation gets too heavy, though thankfully this interesting mistake is simply an intriguing off-ramp; in lesser hands most of this would sound far worse then it does."
3,"For the hardcore only,good luck finding it","Alright my 1st review!When I first got it was so confused by it.I mean hell, 60% of the 2 disc set is instrumentals.The stand out tracks are:Power Flower 9.5/10,Ai no,Sono 7.5/10,The hit Send one your love 10/10,Come back as a flower 8/10,A seed's a star 9/10,& the secret life of plants 9.5/10. Remember,4 the hardcore fans only!"
5,very special,i have this recording on vinyl and on cd. i first heard it when it came out in '79 as a young teen...this stevie wonder piece is very deep. those who won't get it...don't get this...but those of you who are looking for more music material on the subject of the beauty of life and superb music get a copy right away!!! steviegoes deep...plants...how many of us really appreciate that if it was not for the star that we call the sun and plants where would we be? That is whatthe title songs asks 'secret life of plants.' in the most melodicway...not boring or new age-y...by the way this album was pre new age...it came out during the disco days...well disco was atits end in 1979. for those tired of the same bump and grind love song or songs about the same old subjects by who ever is hot orhalf naked and half singing try this cd please!!!
5,Pure brilliance!,"When I first got this album over a year ago, I wasn't too thrilled with it, I had one favourite back then, ""Outside my Window"". Now I think it is his best album. Just listen to ""Power Flower"", that has an awesome melody that is so sincere and honest and he sings it in a tone i've never heard him sing in before. Another favourite for me is ""Come back as a flower"" that is sung by Syretta but she does an excellent job singing to another cool music track done by Stevie with very direct percussion. This album does contain a lot of musical experiments which took me a long time to fully appreciate but now I realize that they're all brilliant in their own way. The song ""Secret Life of Plants"" is one of the last songs on the album and is sampled many times on many of previous tracks, some very briefly but very effectively. There are not enough good things to say about this album, just buy it and let Stevie take you on a guided tour through ""The Secret Life of Plants""."
4,"Underrated ""Plants"" blossom with genius","At first,a tedious meandering double album that's very light on hits,and heavy on bombast.But dig a little deeper and you'll realise Stevie Wonder's full genius in bloom.The fact that a blind man scores a motion picture(which may or may not have been released,let alone been seen by many)is astonishing,but instrumental suites like The First Garden,Ecclesiastes,and Journey To India shows Stevie has the goods to do it.The hit singles(Send One Your Love,Outside My Window)sounds slight compared to a beautiful pair of ballads,Black Orchid and Come Back As A Flower(sung by his ex-wife Syreeta).JTTSLOP,although bloated by overlong songs(Race Babbling,A Seed's A Star...)shows a musical genius at his hieght,even more than Songs In The Key Of Life."
3,For big fans only,"This is a Soundtrack CD very few people ever saw this movie; mostly instrumental, with few vocal tracks; Difficult to decide what to make of that album and how to rate it..However, due to his previous releases, SW was very hot at the time and everyone bought this album back in 1979.I just bought it again on CD; simply because it's a rare CD to find and also because I am a big fan of Stevie Wonder; If you are not a CD collector or a new fan of this great artist, try instead:1. Talking Book2. Innervisions3. Songs in the Key of life."
2,Wrong color,I ordered yellow paint and received orange. The company emailed me and asked if I wanted to send it back or they would give me $10 refund. I took the refund but find this whole experience kind of lame.
2,Not up to Monch standards,"In the barren wasteland of the current hip hop desert, one tends to look at anything that doesn't sound exactly the same as the mainstream trash as something better than it truly is. If this album were released in 1994-2000, it would be considered in Pharoahe Monch's minor works. Surely we wouldn't place it with his seminal masterpiece Stress: The Extinction Agenda, or even the now defunct solo record Internal Affairs. This album has way too much sugary r & b hooks throughout, this from the same guy who posited ""Why do you choose to listen to R & B?"" Gun Talks is a standout cut, but haven't true Organized Konfusion fans already been down this road with Stray Bullet?Pharoahe's skills on the mic are always going to be at the top of the game, the production and lack of subject matter needs to catch up. Mediocre and redundant."
4,WOW He is in my top 5 (4.5),"This album is great! If your not into the thoughtful rap then dont buy this CD. I feel like this CD was something different. There is no bull on this CD its str8 hip hop and thats something i havent heard in a WHILE!!! The lyrics, singing, and hooks are all great! That's true but some of the production is a little on the ""I dont know"" side. Over all its a great album!"
3,Desired a better album!,"I am a Pharoahe Monch fan and that's why I give ""Desire"" three stars. If I could I'd give it 3 & 1/2. He is very talented and i've listened to him since his Organized Konfusion days. To me a 13 song album should not have any weak points and this one does. Re-doing a ""Public Enemy"" song is a mistake for any artist no matter the talent. Using somewhat weak production and being a good artist is always a poor choice. Pharoahe is worth great beats, so he should use great beats. I did like a good percentage of the songs but there are only 13 and I paid more than $13 to buy the album. You do the math."
3,Makes you think.,I think this is a pretty good album. I only recently started listening to this dude. I like how he's conscience of the politcal environment and speaks his feelings about it. The first few tracks are hot fire but over all the album is thought provoking.
3,Desire 4 a change!!!,"This a good album for someone who has lost faith in Hip-Hop. Pharoahe put some work in on this album. Plenty of punchlines, battle rhymes, positive rhymes, sex, and stories. Well balanced album, the song ""When The Gun Draws"" is a little overrated in my opinion, but still o.k.It's short and good, he does not waste time with filler songs. All songs I can see why they made the cut. I luv the song ""Free""....check that one out."
5,Lyrcial Slayer,Pharoahe Monch is a genius. He always brings catchy beats and lyrics that leave u at a loss. Not as good as internal affairs but still a great album from beginning to end!
5,New Found Love,"So, I was at Rock The Bells in NY a couple months ago. I always was familiar with Pharoache Monch but never LOVED him. (this is probably because I never heard Internal Affairs, which is now one of my favorite CD's ever) He was one of the performances. He put on an amazing show. When Simon Says popped on, people went nuts including me. Once Styles P as a special guest ran out for My Life, I was in complete awe. Since then, I copped Internal Affairs and Desire. Desire is a great, original CD. He is so original and his OWN person. I can't really say he flows like anyone. He is one of my top 5 favorite artists for sure. Real hip hop heads will enjoy this CD. My favorite tracks are Desire and Welcome to the Terrordome, and I love every other track almost equally."
4,P Monch is back,"The follow up to the Classic Internal Affairs, this album is great. Original Hip Hop where everything lately sounds the same. Buy this album, support the artist. We need more hip hop like this."
5,A mind-opening book,"I encountered this book while exploring neopaganism/Goddess religion, but I would heartily reccommend it even to someone with no interest in such things. The book challenges points of view such as objectivity, dualism, and social structures that I had taken for granted and never thought of questioning, and does so in a constructive way. The writing is warm and personal, but I find this suited to the subject. Can an impersonal ""scientific"" view really do justice to something as personal and human as religion? I reccommend this book to anyone wanting to broaden their point of view about religion, social structure, or life in general."
3,Speech 001,"The service was very fast. But, I made a mistake and ordered the wrong book. The prices can't be bet....."
4,"Live collection, not live show...","I think this is a great live Iggy collection for the casual Iggy/Stooges fan, but I enjoy collectiong entire shows. Many of the recordings here are available on cds I already have, so I imagine other serious fans would be disapointed too. The quality of the recordings is great when compared with the many live discs available."
2,Hard to read. Limited scope.,"I bought the paperback edition. Many of the drawings are cramped and barely legible. The paperback version(about 5"" x 8.5"") does not leave much room for the larger whole machine drawings. The hardback version is probably larger, and therefore may contain larger, clearer drawings.The author gives a general overview which I found weakly tied to hard to read drawigns and then delves into Pffaf, New Home, Brother, and White models. Most of the machines I have are old Kenmore (Sears) and Montgomery Wards models. I would have liked to seen these models examined.I don't have any of the models listed, but I feel I can probably extrapolate how to fix the ones I have from this book. I expect to spend a lot of time flipping through the pages with the machine in question in front of me and looking at the drawings with a magnifying glass or enlarged on a copier."
2,"Ok, but nothing extra","Its ""OK"" to learn general sewing machine theory - and might be good if you happen to own one of the very few machines it goes into detail on. Otherwise, give it a miss."
3,Not what I had hoped it would be,"I live on an Island in Alaska and I hear or see here n there, people needing their Sewing Machine repaired or worked on. So I searched and looked through books, and I had hoped this would be the best of what I had searched through. I was disappointed after getting the book. The read is not very user friendly and for a Visual Learn, it was tough for me keep reading. This might be good for some, but it didn't meet my expectation.It you're a reader, they get this....."
1,Dreami Buzz Bassinet,"Way too overpriced and it is made in China so the quality is a little iffy. I still can't figure out how to use the rain cover which is cheaply made. After you remove the bassinet from the stroller, you have to have 3 hands to close the stroller. You have to buy the stroller to use it"
5,Gorgeous!,"This is a terrific buy. If you never wanted to go to Venice before - you will now! The photographs are outstanding and the text not too boring. An invaluable reference for artists. Thank heaven someone thought to study these ancient floors before they are lost! Supposedly ""there is nothing new under the sun"", well, I would consider having one of these designs in a new home, if I could find anyone with the patience to complete one!"
5,"Saintanism, witches and Heavy metal all in one.","this was a book I red when I was in 9th grade. I couldnt put it down then and I still can not. you'll read this one over and over. The witches are so evil, but at the same time you fall in love with their charecters. keeps you turning pages.If your lucky enough to find a copy still it's a good read."
2,Better Off Sleeping In,"I'm always on the lookout for well done horror - something like Peter Straub's ""Ghost Story"", Susan Hill's ""Woman in Black,"" or of course Stephen King, particularly his earlier work. I picked up ""Candlemas Eve"" on a whim accompanied by some strong reviews here, but was left wanting. I found this a lurid, juvenile attempt at horror that is more like a group of pre-teens discovering a cache of Playboy magazines than it is horror. If you're looking for an aging rock star's confrontation with the supernatural, you may want to try Joe Hill's ""Heart-Shaped Box"", or just go back and read his dad's ""Salem's Lot"" again."
4,I read this book when it came out in the 80's!,"I read this book when I was a teenager and I remember it as being a great book at the time. I was into that genre more at that age and remember it being a hot topic amongst the other girls. I don't remember guys reading this book for the ""porn"" aspect of it--as someone else has claimed in one of the reviews.It was well written and kept you glued to the pages until it was finished. That is how I remembered it. If you like this genre, you will like this book."
3,What else can be said?,"Stephanie Mills has been putting out compilation CDs for so long (as opposed to new material), that it is questionable what would distinguish any one compilation CD from any other..... This is no exception."
2,"Hmm, I really didn't see the need for this book?","I really have to be honest? Why did FASA comission this book as part of the Twilight series? I can't be more blunt! It dragged and the whole novel took a decent person in the guise of Russou Howell and turned him into a sadist. Sorry, but I would rather have seen another installment by Mrss. Stackpole or Gressman. Let's hope Thurston does better with Falcon Rising."
1,Horrifically bad,"This book could possibly be the worst battletech book ever written. The book does nothing to advance the Twilight of the Clans series, serving to bog you down in between books that actually are readable.The main character whose name is ""Horse"" (yes, Horse) is hardly believable, while his nemesis, Howell is needlessly sadistic and is almost clownish. He spends more time yelling and screaming, so that it is hard to understand why the allegely competant Clans would not have killed this idiot off. This book was so bad that I literally question how this man ever got this book published."
2,Seemenly out of place...,The book truely seems out of place in the twilight of the clans series. it is only when you read Falcon rising you understand it fully. it is a set up to show that the jade falcons treat their freebirths in an enlightened way compared ot other clans. I found it an intresting read on backwater clan life but would have prefered something more
2,Robert Thurston has better BT novels available,"Freebirth, #4 in the Twilight of the Clans series, really seems to derail from the general plot of the series. There is very little combat in this book, and most of the book is spent on talking. My best suggestion is to skip this book and go straight from The Hunters to Sword and Fire. You won't miss much. I would have to say that this is the only BattleTech novel that I've read that I really didn't like. If you really want a Robert Thurston book, try I am Jade Falcon or the Legend of the Jade Pheonix Trilogy instead."
5,Subtle humor at its finest in Battletech,"It appears I'm quite alone in thoroughly enjoying this book. This book was hilarious, in a very sarcastic, subtle way, apparently no one has noticed it!I agree that it was virtually no place as far as continuity goes in series, but regardless it provided fun insight on the daily lives of solahma and workings of the Huntress. The whole planet from Jag to Falcon was slightly insane, but what do you expect from a bunch of washups? That whole tears thing with Bren Roshak had me cracking up. The verbal adroitness was imagery was very amusing. It relied more on dialogue than action and maybe thats why everyone seems to hate it. Most Battletech characters seem to be a tad humorless but not this crew."
1,<YAWN>,"I hate this book. It is the WORST book I have ever read. It is incredibly boring and has nothing to do wtih the twilight of the clans. The story is boring,the ONE combat is boring, the charecters are boring. It was a chore to finish this book. I had to have caffiene to stay awake while reading it. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Also, when I finished Prince of Havoc and found out that thurston is writing the next twilight of the clans i screamed."
3,"Mediocre novel, and gamewise...don't get me started","The novel's story elements are mediocre at best, and not what I expected after Thurston's excellent ""Jade Phoenix"" trilogy and his independant works, also as a part time gametester, and an avid player of BattleTech, the combat descriptions and new equipment he uses are...laughable at best, and obscene abominations at worst. Not what I expected, especially when the author has done much better"
3,A somewhat disappointing addition to the Twilight series ...,"I can see the reasons of the addition of this storyline to the Twilight series, for it predicts the upcoming problems for Task Force Serpent. It also continues on story Russou which was left hanging after The Exodos. However, what's up with the character of Russou? It seems probable that Russou is disturbed by Trent's death and the politics occurring in Clan Smoke Jaguar. But he seemed as honorable and dedicated to Kerensky's vision as Trent. Yet in this book he is seen as sadistic. Would Trent even recognize this character? However the book provide some interesting events like a battle b/w LAMS and Omni-Mechs and events that propel the storyline. I just wonder where the excerpt in the beginning is in the book."
3,"Pretty pointless, but good all the same.","I would have liked the book alot more if It had focused on Task Force Serpent more, however, It was still a good book."
1,Wished I could give '0' stars,"I really liked Thurston's Jade Phoenix trilogy which gives us the major and most detailed description of Clan society in the btech universe.But 'Freebirth' is an absolute pain. It's chaotic, it makes no sense, it is full of logical mistakes, it's simply embarassing.You want facts? How's this:2 LAM's destroying 2 front class clan omnis pilotted by elite clan MW's...go dreamin'.A proven clan officer who goes whack, acting like Jim Carey, and flopping around like Lieutenant Harris in Police Academy?A solahma mechwarrior who's all of sudden competing like Natasha Kerensky herself (SCom Buhallin).Oh, dear...you gotta wonder who's been the freeborn editor of this novel. So if you wanna do yourself a favor: Don't read this book, even if you're a die-hard btech reader. And its story doesnt even play any role in the subsequent novels of the Twilight of the Clans series. Go figure."
1,thurston's worst,"I'm sorry to say that this is THurston's worst book yet. Gone are the great Jade Phoenix stories. Marthe Pryde is slipping away from teh things that made her interesting, and my fleeting appreciation for Horse lasted all of three chapters this time."
2,Terrible book,"oh man, this book is terrible.The story does not further the time-line of the Battletech universe.All he does is summarize information about what Freebirth means, the Clan invasion, the Clans' traditions.The author of the book can't put together a coherent plot.It is like a bad soap opera.The characters' dialogues are often interrupted by petty, trivial information. It is not smooth.Some of the pages in the book is like a ""Copy 'n Paste"" of the first book in the Twilight series.The author goes on and on about the 'death' of Trent by Howell in the first 8 chapters. The worst part of the book is the ""Circle of Kinship""."
1,What is it doing here?,"When I picked up this book I was eagerly awaiting to find out what was going to happen to Task Force Serpent. This book had no place in this series and should never have been written, although if it was a book on it's own no-one would buy it. It is by far the worst book in the series so far only just behind Starlord. Hopefully the next book this man writes will follow on from the books before and not go off on a tangent as this one has done."
5,Wanda Sa is Marvelous!,This is great Bossa Nova. The guitar and vocal work of Menescal are a delight. Wanda Sa's phrasing and vocal quality are impeccable...and gorgeous.
5,Music to lift your spirits....,"This music is happy and exciting always great to play when you're feeling down...and when you're feeling good. It is romantic and sensual, recommended for any lover of Latin music."
2,Where was the editing?,"I must agree with Sandy S. that this was a poorly written book. The book needed thorough editing and the author needs to be reminded that good fiction writing consists of showing, not telling. Furthermore, it doesn't feel like a mystery if you know who the killer is early on in the book.I purchased this book because it covered a subject matter that I enjoy, but rarely find in fiction form. Unfortunately, although I think the author knows her ghost hunting, I think she forgot that the fun of a ghost story is in the ghosts. She had one or two creepy moments that I applauded her for, but I would have enjoyed more haunting. I realize that this might not depict a real or typical haunting, but this is fiction afterall.Overall, if you really want to read this, I would suggest trying to find a copy you didn't have to pay for."
3,Good first effort.,This small but entertaining novel is a good first effort for the author. It lacked depth and details which would have made it better but as a freshman effort its not so bad. You won't lose anything by reading it but it will not provide the thrills and chills you may have hoped for.
2,Did I read the same book?,"I hate to be the first person to give this book a negative review, but I thought it was reallllly badly written. The characters are all two dimensional, and the writer gives away the murderer early on in the book. Also, who edited this book? A woman named Elaine hires the heroine, but later in the book they refer to her as Sylvia, then back to Elaine. I found myself going back to the beginning trying to figure out who Sylvia was. She didn't exist. One reviewer states this book is written by a Mensan. She may be a genius, but she can't write."
5,Movies that the whole family can enjoy.....,I really love this movie. Another Cinderella-type movie. I wish I am going to be able to purchase Au Pair II through Amazon soon.
1,customer service was horric,After never recieving the item all I recieved was the run around. After filing a grievance with Amazon I was able to get a refund.
3,Good basic lesson in owning your own sales business.,"There were a few chapters that I was fading off, wondering what they had to do with the over-all book. I remember saying to myself, ""Yeah, yeah. Get on with it."" However, there were a couple chapters well worth the ticket price. I shared various portions in sales meetings and got a kick out of the responses."
4,Interesting read.,"An interesting read. However there's not really a lot of sales techniques one can learn from the book. I found the Joe Girard Law of 250 quite useful -- the idea of how one person could affect your sales opportunities in future, since he/she would likely know or be related to another 250 people."
5,How To Sell Anybody Anything,"This book is a must for those new to the selling field and a smart investment for those that are not ""All They Can Be"". I have been suggesting this book for about 25 years and made it required reading for my sales force.As in all sales books there are chapters that will rub you the wrong way but you paid the money so try Joe's methods for 21 consecutive days and if they do not bring results then set them aside and use what does work.The chapter regarding the ""Water Cooler"" is worth the price of the book. If you think this is old hat remember ""There is nothing new to Selling"" maybe new ways to do old things and new names for old methods. I have often wondered what sales records Doug Edwards, Red Motley and the ""Old Timers"" would have set if they had the self checks we have today to keep us on track."
5,You should read this book,Joe Girard is a legend in the field of selling for good reason. This book is great for building a salesteam as well as improving your sales. He talks about timeless ideas on how to sell anything to anybody. You have got to read this book.
4,awesome read,"great book, makes you wanna get on your feet and do something pronto! some pretty cool thoughts and ideas that i've never really considered before but was pointed out in this book."
5,A life-altering experience,"30 years ago, reading this book and Clayton Knox's ""Birth of a Salemen"" changed me from being a propeller-headed computer nerd into a technology businessman. The subtle, crucial techniques required to build a network and develop a pool of satisfied, loyal clients have stayed with me and allowed me to reach goals that were completely out of reach before. The book is fun to read and can be very profitable."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Unless you are selling cars, I wouldn't waste your money. There are other books by Alan Loy McGinnis and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale that would be better for your salesmanship and positive attitude. Also a lot of material in this book is basic boilerplate if you talk to any experienced car salesperson."
3,Great if you are selling CARS,"This book is called ""How to Sell Anything to Anybody,"" but it should be called, ""How to Sell Cars."" All the examples and all the author's experience is related to selling cars. I know there are a lot of similarities between selling cars and selling other things, but this book centered on a lot of things that are only relevent to the auto industry. The title is definitely deceiving!"
1,Sucker,"Hey! They suckered me, maybe they'll sucker you too but not after reading my review huh? LOL! Yeah, salespeople are naturals, product knowledge contributes, basic knowledge, I never read this book."
3,I'm Not Sure About This One.,"Hmmmm. I'm not sure about this book. Is it believable? Sort of. Is it well wwritten? Sort of. Is it true? Maybe. I just don't get good vibes from this book......maybe it's just me. It is a very small book which is over priced, and that alone is a warning signal. So, bottom line.......check it out for yourself, if you don't mind paying too much."
4,Nice sheen,"Works as a nice shiny gloss alone, or under the aquarella polishes as a smooth base. I like it a lot!"
4,Seems to do its job!,"I'm using this as recommended in conjunction with the Acquarella nail polish. It works as a clear polish, as well.The best thing about it is that it does not trigger contact dermatitis or cause nail pitting like the drug store stuff, so I'm excited about that!"
4,nail strengthener,"Fantastic stuff. No smell, easy to apply, long lasting. Compliments colored polish well."
1,Nope!,"I would not recommend this product at all. it took my manicurist FOREVER to take off my Aquarella nail polishes. If you're going for a natural polish, go elsewhere."
4,Best DIY Polish I've Ever Tried,"I have never been able to get nail polish to last; it often peels off w/in a day of application. I've only had one professional manicure last + it was an expensive one.Acquarella's nail conditioner applies evenly, leaves a lovely shine and lasts pretty well I avoid certain oily products. It doesn't peel off + any wear or scratches are hard to see. Plus, I can apply another thin coat w/o much build up.To remove this conditioner, I use Acquarella's remover which works best if you saturate the cotton + let it soak on the nail for about a minute before rubbing.Another big plus: these products don't seem to dry out my nails at all."
2,Acquarella products,"The conditioner can be used as a clear polish by itself. When applying it per the directions it will build up a base coat on the nail so that the colored polish will adhere. The problem is that as your nails grow out or just from daily wear and tear, the conditioner/polish will start to chip and the ""remover"" will not completely remove it. This is OK if you keep applying the base coat because it will hide the uneven nail surface to some degree, but looks messy if you want to discontinue the products. Regular nail polish remover won't remove it either. It has to grow out or wear off."
2,VHS is a dead media format,"Mighty Max is an awesome show and needs to make the transition to DVD soon. I wouldn't recommend video tapes like this unless all you own is a VHS player... and even then, I'd recommend you get a DVD player and wait for the awesomeness of Mighty Max to come to DVD. :)"
1,Word,"im a big fan of mighty max here, but very dissapointed to see no descriptions here, you see in order to atract customers here, you must...MUST have product descriptions, prices, and what contains in the product, for instances, if it seems higher then what you think, dont buy, if this only contains 2 episodes and the price is over 20 dont buy it, just precaution, but if you could tell me what the price is on this and could tell me where to find the dvd version with all 40 episodes that be great lol buh bye..."
5,Absinthe recipe and more,"This book has a recipe for just about any kind of compound you could possibly want to make at home. From rust preventatives to cleaning preparations, beer, wine and rare liquors such as absinthe, also paints, craft glues, marbles and cosmetics. Even fireworks! Wonderful book!"
4,a TON of great info!,"This book is a throwback to the days when there wasn't a ""big box"" dept store on every corner for your every need and people tended to make a lot of the things they needed. It's not something to sit down a read like a novel but if there's some formula based mixture you may have need of this is where to go to find it!"
1,This book had no plot,Nothing happened the entire book. When something did happen it was so badly described that it seemed like nothing was happening. The characters were not thought out and were undeveloped. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to fall asleep.
2,The Collapsing bag,"I have a lot of tools to carry and keep organized. When I received this bag it was not what I expected. There were plenty of pockets but there was nothing keeping the bag open. I loaded up all the interior pockets with screwdrivers, pliers, and chisels but the whole bag just collapsed inward, making it a chore to get into. It would be a great bag if there was a cage or metal support rim. I'm going to give this to my dog to play with. Save your money on this one, unless you want to play a prank on someone."
3,"Okay, doesn't work for me though.",I bought this bag cause i like a rigid bag that has lots of vertical pockets which this does. But I am unhappy with the way the flaps that the handle are attached to are rigid. This means I couldn't fold the flaps down to fit the bag in my toolbox at work. Also the handle strap is way to long. The bag is nice but because it doesn't fit in my toolbox I am unable to use it. I ended up purchasing a different bag. I would return this one but I'm not gonna pay to ship it back.
5,Not Just a waist pack,"This is a well constructed bag and holds up well to daily use. I carry sun glasses and prescription glasses as well, a palm T5, ipod wallet and misc. items. It's the perfect size for me. I normally sling it over my back. It even has small side pockets which are perfect for holding my id badge or other small items like usb thumb drive."
4,"If you're looking for roomy, this is the one to get",You can take everything but the kitchen sink in this pack. My only (small) concern is that it doesn't seem quite as durable as some others I've owned.
5,larger waist,this is very nice but way too big to wear on my waist my niece saw it & she bought it from me & she loves it but if you are a medium sized person it is way too big good quality though.
1,Hey eye can spell diphrent. Woo-pee)))))))))))))))))))))) 0 0 0 0 o,"So this guy could have saved us all a whole hell of a lot of time if he had just come to the point. Could have put out a little pamphlet stating how he liked [...] and sunshine and cute, little things going on in the park and went on his merry, skiptomylou way. Instead, he's got professors tripping on acid frothing at the gills to extol his merits. This thing's even cheaply bound. I'd recommend the publisher (should the worst be realized and another edition get printed) use a softer stock next time so it's easier to wipe my bottom with the pages."
5,Great Collection,"Like E.E. Cummings? This massive book has every single poem he ever released (not to mention a few hundred that weren't). If you aren't satisfied with buying the individual books, just pay the thirty-somewhat dollars and get every book anthologized in entierety.A neat feature is not only the arrangment of poems by book release, but also, in the back, an index of all the first lines of all the poems alphabatized and labeled with the respective page number.It's the complete collection. Spend the extra 20 bucks and get this instead of just 1 book of poems. Your mind will thank you dearly."
4,lower case letters,"e.e.cummings has endeared me to lower case letters. how he uses words and sounds and construct his poetry entrances me. i adore his visual imagery - flowers, stars, the cosmos. i love how he is erotic without being pornographic. his words delight and amaze me. especially ""the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses"". ponder this collection and sigh deeply kimmie"
4,a great collection of amazing poetry,"This book, a collection of all of E.E. Cummings' poetry is a beautiful composition.. There are many poems on the obscure side, and many on the traditional side... The range is completely in between, as well. The great sonnets, and sensuous poems in here make it very worth reading. Not a front to back book, I found it was easier to skim through, and stop every now and then, reading a poem that caught my eye.."
5,great collection of EE Cummings poetry,This is such a great and complete collection of his poetry. It's easily readable (good font size and style). it's divided very well to and easily searchable in the index to find exactly what you're looking for. i love it so much and enjoy just flipping thru and discovering new poems of his i've never read. so amazing.
1,"Early Failure -- No Service, No Replacement","Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!We bought one of these units approximately nine months earlier. It worked well except that one microphone ""cut-out"". After a lot of experimenting we were able to get it work by putting two quarters under the battery thus increasing the pressure on the contact points. This ""remedy"" lasted about two months. Now the microphone is ""dead""!Although it seems amazing, we have been unsuccessful in obtaining manufacturer contact information either from Amazon customer service or Google searches. Since we cannot find a way to have the bad microphone repaired or replaced, the system is useless as a two microphone system. A one microphone system does not meet our needs. Therefore we wasted $229. We thought this was a bargain but it shows you that you get what you pay for!"
2,Great idea but poor router mount design,"I tried to mount my router on this jig for the first time and the plastic cracked. The places where the screws are attached only have 1/3 of the thickness. This is too weak! If I loosen the screws a bit, the router would not stay at a fixed position. This jig would work well if the material is metal or the mouting area is made stronger. I've wasted $35 for this piece of junk! I could have made my own jig."
1,sorry i bought this set,"i regreted buying this product after a few weeks of using them. dont be fooled by the caphalon name. the soft grip handles on these pots ""slide out"" when the pans heat up as this can be very dangerous especially if your transferring a pan from one burner to another. also you have to cook your food on low heat or your food will stick. i definitely do not recommemd."
3,"For architects, not interior designers","When I ordered this book, I was expecting to see a lot of pictures to help me design my house. But to my dismay, most of the colorless pages just feature blueprints that only an architect would understand. I kept the book for future reference."
2,Japanese construction,"This book is most suited for people who are doing research. It is not for someone looking for building ideas, as it is not similar to building to code, nor for those with western ideas of the beautiful home."
5,Happy customer,"Very happy with my purchase, I am a wood worker & this is a book that I will find useful for future projects. Thank you. Amazon."
5,Interesting and Informative,"""Songwriting and the Creative Process"" has plenty of info on the nuts and bolts of writing commercially acceptable music. Song structure, rhyme and meter, and a good section on hearing musical intervals are included. There are headings under ""Courting the Muse"" I find interesting and informative, and problems such as ""writer's block"" are addressed. One thing that I liked was the overall layout of the book which is neatly broken into easily digestable bits. I may be a little overenthusiastic, but I'll give it five stars."
3,powerful but average life,"We bought this power washer for our used car dealership 3 yrs ago. Lots of power, wanted to spend more so it would last than the last ""lowes"" power washer. In 3 years weve replaced, 1 engine mounts, 2 the trigger handle (leaked) and hose, blown, 3 Detergent injector quit, 4 Now valves in pump are malfunctioning, running about 50% pressure, No one will ""fix it"" have to replace the pump (400.00!?). The engine still running fine. I stepped up to an industrial unit and it didnt last longer than the predecessor that was half the price. Humpf. Lots of power and we do use it hard, but...wasnt worth the upgrade."
4,It's been four months,"So far, I haven't experienced any major problems with this machine. This is my first pressure washer, so I don't have much to compare it to. However, the product has delivered everything I've asked of it. The only problem is, an o-ring broke and it was the only size ring NOT supplied in the repair kit. Other than that, I am pleased with my purchase and expect many more years with this equipment as a part of my painting business."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is a short, not particularly interesting novel told in twelve parts. It also has some illustrations by famous comic artist Bernie Wrightson.When the killings in a small town in yes, Maine, keep mounting up, the townspeople come to the conclusion a werewolf is at work. Redneck drunk hunters aren't too useful though, and a young crippled boy has to work it all out."
4,"Good movie, not so good book........(explains below)","Howdy,Now usually I don't say this about books based on movies but the movie was better. I read the book thinking it would be more detailed. it wasn't. To my utter disappointment, I was shocked to see that is was thinner then Stephen King's usual workings.So all in all, I rate it a 4 because it wasn't as good as it's movie offspring."
3,Too Short,"This book is an ok read, but not anywhere near King's best. Maybe if he had've expanded upon the story it could've made a great novel. Now it seems rushed and made just for a quick buck. Luckily, the story is good enough to keep you interested and the pictures are amazing. But there are problems with the pics too, some show things that don't happen until a few pages later and it really spoils some things. But it's a werewolf story and that's got to be good for something."
3,So-So.,"The hardcover special edition of CYCLE OF THE WEREWOLF is sorare you can only find it at auctions. I would only recommend the hardcover special edition of this book for collecting, considering how rare it is."
3,Not the best Stephen King book,"This wasn't the best Stephen King book. It was a good book, but I thought it should be a short story or something. It was very gory too. The pictures show it. Not a book for the younger kids. I brought it to school and kids looked at the pictures and said they wouldn't eat for a week. Overall the plot was good and it had a good ending. I havn't seen the movie ""Silver Bullit"" which is based on the book, but I want to. Just to see what it is like."
4,my first king read,"It was a pretty good book,but theres one thing I want to clear up...IT IS NOT A CHILDRENS BOOK.It has Nasty words and adult content.I think that I was 10 when I read this book.Now I'm 11,and i've read The body,apt pupil,rita haworth and the shawshank redmption,cujo,and I am currently reading The backman books.Trust me,if your thinking about getting you'r kid(s) this book...Remeber my review."
1,What happened to the Great Stephen King???,"In days past, Stephen King was perhaps the most talented and prolific horror writer in history. That began to erode with the release on the fantasy Dark Tower series. This 'book' (more of a pamphlet) is perhaps the most overpriced and underwritten item yet. It is a very short, large print paperback with a 12th grade story and is super overpriced. Save your money until the crowning of a new King."
2,disappointing,"MR. King was definitely off his game on this one. i like short stories, but this book was nearly childlike in its composition."
2,UNIMPRESSED,"I've read almost all of King's books, and I find this one to be predictable, boring, and - if I may - not of the same caliber as others such as Christine, IT, and Cujo."
3,Not what you would expect from Stephen King,"This book was a surprise. It was a quick read (I finished it in one afternoon) and it didn't lift the hair off of the back of my neck even once. This was not one of Stephen King's more memorable works and should never even be mentioned in the same breath at ""It"" or ""The Stand"". That being said I also used to love comic books or as they are often referred to now ""Graphic Novels"". This book was wonderfully illustrated and is a great example of a fun read for those of us who may not be able to get really involved with in-depth characters. I would recommend it to any fan of gore and pulp fiction. As long as you know you are getting into a glorified comic book and not a King thrill ride I think you will enjoy it too."
3,"Fast Read, Boring Plot","Cycle of the Werewolf, by Stephen King. It sounds promising, and starts off pretty good, but as the calender months start going by(the whole book is one giant calender) it starts to lag. By lag, I mean that the story begins to repeat itself, and once cool ideas turn boorrrrrinnnng. The artwork though(one for every month, the months are like chapters) is incredibly chilling and original, well worth the 15.95 cover price of the book alone. Berni Wrightson(the illustrator) should get the credit for this book, not Stephen King. A werewolf tale, this book is well worth reading for some scenes, but not most. Only for a die-hard fan of Stephen King. Basically, good for a quick, short scare but not much else. 3 stars, or Grade: C-."
4,"Four stars for story, five for illustrations!!!","I'm a reader and one day I did not, seemingly, have anything to read. I asked my son if he could suggest anything and he said Stephen King. He did not see me for about three months after that, and we live in the same apartment. I read almost everything Stephen King wrote. This book is a special book - I mean in general. Berni Wrightson's illustrations make it a book I would grab to save if there was a fire, and I have a lot of books. This story is not like the video. The book is nicely framed in twelve sections according to months, and so we are treated to a woodcut-like black and white picture first thing, and then to a color, very well executed, scary picture of a pivotal event, in every chapter. Good versus evil at its very best! - no spoiler. (And then Stephen King, in one of his books, turned me on to Stephen Dobyns, for which I am very grateful . . .)"
4,Good,"IMO, this is King's best and most under rated. Spawned a movie called Silver Bullet. I read it in about an hour and a half. It is one of the best werwold stories ever made. Lovely illustrations. I would recommend it not only to horror fans but just casual readers as well."
2,Hey im looken for this kinda book,I'm looken for a sicking werewolf book. One thats about a werewolf & he or she has to go around and turn others into werewolfs & is being hunted by a wereewolf killer or something can you recement something.
4,Pretty good book.,This was the first Stephen King book I read. I liked it. I'm in my teens and I think it's something that my age group would like.
3,I liked the movie better for once.,"I love stephen king's books but this one wasn't one of his best. If you get a chance, rent the movie Silver Bullett."
4,Gift,This was a gift for a friend. She was very glad to get it for her collection. It was in great shape. Thanks.
3,"Good old fashion horror, but not long enough to be that cool","i liked it because it was old fashion, but it was too short and not scary so that was a let down but it's still cool that i can say i read it."
4,Descriptive pictures,"I liked the pictures and I think that it was a good story, no matter what anyone else thinks."
4,IT'S A FANTASTIC BOOK,"I think that Cycle of the Werewolf is the best book that I've ever read. It's packed with action, and the best thing about it is that it's a great quick read. I also liked the pictures."
2,JUST OKAY,"I REALIZE THAT THIS WAS JUST A SHORT STORY FOR STEPHEN KING, BUT IT WAS A GOOD AS SOME OF HIS OTHER WORKS. I THINK THAT THIS COULD HAVE REALLY BEEN MADE INTO A GREAT FULL LENGTH NOVEL.....WOULD HAVE LOVED TO READ THAT ONE!"
2,"NOT RECOMENDED to quick, good illistrations","This book is way too fast. It can easily be read in a few hours. Not only that, the story is too predictable. However the illistrations are good, and most likely the best part of the book. I definatly do NOT recomend this book. It's hard to find and not worth the trouble. Not even close in comparision to the other king books."
2,NOT ONE OF HIS BETTER WORKS,READ THIS BOOK IN A COUPLE HOURS. STORY WAS GOOD BUT NOT UP TO THE USUAL KING STANDARDS.NICE PICTURES.PREDICTABLE STORY LINE. GOOD FOR A QUICK READ.
2,dissapointing,"When I got done with this book I thought Stephen King had decided he wanted to write a children's book. The only thing that stops me from believing this are the bits of gore that were thrown in. Other than that it is certainly short enough, and predictable enough to entertain children if no-one else."
2,lacks a plot,"this is the story about a werewolf haunting someplace. it's one episode for each month. some of the descriptions are quite good. but how many werewolf episodes do we need? to be SK this is amazingly little plot-oriented. it is obviously written just for fun (or money). the way it is done, makes you lose interest. no reason to bother with psychology, not much of a plot to grab your attention, etc."
5,Your looking for the song East Hastings,"many people that have written reviews for this are asking about the song where he is walking around London...its a song by Montreal Band, Godspeed You Black Emperor! and its called East Hastings. Its on their first album F#A#(infinity). Surprisingly almost every song on that album could have scored this movie. Very moody stuff. Also the reason its not on the soundtrack is probably due to the bands request. They are notorious for turning away from soundtracks, i was shocked when i heard they were in this movie. That being said i do like the soundtrack from this movie. The use of the Grandaddy song in the film had me laughing."
5,"Not your average ""scary movie"" soundtrack","While I watched the movie '28 Days Later..."" I realized, ""Wow. This a good music!"" during every scene. I loved it how the music can be so soothing during an intense scene. (unlike, for example, the Jaws thing...) Even if you haven't seen this movie, I would recommend the soundtrack! It is not your average ""scary movie"" soundtrack!-The Godspeed You! Black Emperor song is called ""East Hastings"""
2,Don't buy the whole album!,"I got this thinking that getting the entire album would be better. I was wrong. Given that many of the tracks appeared to be very short, I thought this album was meant to be played as one long continuous piece, but that is not the case. Most of the short tracks are just random clips of ambient music and sound. A few of the tracks have vocals, but they are not very good. Many of the album tracks give you the same ""empty"" feeling that you have throughout the movie, only you aren't watching the movie, so it's not as easy to get into. Save some money. The only tracks worth getting are ""Rage"" and ""In the House""."
2,Pretty but why are they 30 seconds long for $1?,"The music is beautiful, but considering they are all a dollar each I didn't realize some of them are only a few seconds long! I feel pretty ripped off, even if I had noticed it it's not a proper price for a tidbit of a song..."
3,why??,"one of the greatest beginings to a movie with an exceptionaly brilliant song by GY!BE, and it isnt even on the soundtrack!?!?! i wouldn't mind so much since the song is from their album ""f# a# 00"", but it is a different version.otherwise, good stuff."
1,Beware,I bought this Western Pack about 6 months ago and the main buckle has already broken. The tag says to mail back with $15 for handling..The pack is not worth $15.....live and learn. Buyers beware this pack has a cheap plastic buckle that cracked within a few months.
5,Some people didn't buy the right pack....,"Having read some of the other reviews for this product, it seems to me that some people simply bought the wrong item. Anyway...Review for the product: Great ""butt bag"", fanny pack, whatever. SO much room and i use mine everyday which allows me to have most anything I need available to me when I need it. A+Review of Bag King: ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! I paid for the bag at 3pm on a weekday, the 12 noon the NEXT DAY the mailman was delivering the item to my door. I literally had to go back and check the invoice to be sure I wasn't mistaken as to when I had purchased the bag. AAAAAAAA++++++++"
3,"A tired remake of ""Slip""","For some reason the band had the sophmore blues with this recording. It just seems like a tired rearrangement of ""Slip."" Personally, I like it but I would rather listen to its predecessor."
4,Pretty good hardcore,"This isn't really as good as Far's masterpiece Tin Cans With Strings to You, which I regard as the best hardcore album of all time. However, this certainly isn't bad. ""Delusional"" and ""East 3rd Street"" offer some pretty cool riffs, along with ""Backward"" and ""Landmine Spring"". Probably the most interesting song musically speaking is ""Brown Gargantuan,"" which stops in the middle only to start again into an entirely different riff. All the other songs pull their weight as well, making this a solid album. Not neccesarily life-changing , but still a good listen."
5,this is so...kool!,"ya its true that this isnt really a game but it says ""video"" in big letters on the front so that you know what your buying. but anyways overall this video is really neat! its perfect for traveling! my favorite episode is go west young meowth! if your a fan of meowth than i highly recommend buying this! the episode goes way back when meowth was just a kitten and before he joined team rocket. and it explains why he talks and walks like a human too. its a really good episode!"
2,Pokemon Video,"This is a neat little product. My only dislike however is they don't stay true to the original versions too well. One that they cut like half of the theme song, and put that cutup of the theme song before each episode! i know they probably did it to fit the cartridges capabilities, but this makes me very disapointed by the production. i would rather of paid for 1 episode if i could get the full original theme, not the poor cutup that i got on this cartridge.The episodes are alright in quality, though unlike the VHS tapes(and probably dvd sets) there also wasn't a ''who is that pokemon?'' durring either episode. i wish i had known the two above flaws beforehand, but that's alright.If your a true Pokemaniac then this probably isn't for you, but someone who is newer to the series probably wouldn't care so much."
1,Pokemon Beach Blank-Out Blastoise,"Warning! This is not a game!Although Amazon.com lists this as a game, it is NOT a game! It is video of two Pokemon cartoons. False advertising! I'm returning it tomorrow. Don't be deceived like I was!"
5,This Album Rocks!,"Wow! What a great album. You just don't hear rock like this anymore. Seems like everything on the radio is just a bunch of whiney kids or just super-heavy depressing stuff. But My Life's Worth keeps it fun with catchy tunes and meaningful lyrics. ""Lead the Way"" is a great rock song with really strong lyrics. These three guys are very talented musicians and really good songwriters. Buy one now!"
2,No the Same,"I saw him live with E.C.Man, he was great...his voice shookthe walls.I have yet to find a studio disc thatcomes close to that magic."
2,Uhhh... This cd gives me the blues and not the good ones,"I first saw Robert Cray perform at the Crossroads concert with Clapton and an array of other great blues musicians. Based on that performance I checked this cd out of the library and was greatly disappointed. There are at times some good guitar moments but most of the songs lyrics do not match the mastery at the guitar. There are gem moments but I'm afraid for me not enough to warrant any purchase of this cd. I am afraid this is one of only a few cds I have ever listened to that have not excited me or shown me something of a genre I did not know or feel, this takes the blues to no higher level. But don't take my word only you can tell..."
4,Ceiling Fan Swag Kit,"Everything exactly as advertised.Pictured illustration was precisely as packaged. A little flimsy material, but I'm pretty sure it will do what I need it to do. Item arrived in a very short time, too."
3,Not quite what I expected...,"I guess I didn't know what the patterns book was showing. I expected more diversity . A lot of gargoyle type things and old craggy faces is what you get. Still a lot to choose from if this is the way you want to go with your carving. And it looks really involved, which I expected."
2,Not what I expected.,The book is not as informative as I would have like. It is woodcarving tools and techniques used on pumpkins. If you don't own the tools it is a expensive buy in to the hobby versus other pumpkin art done with clay tools.
2,Difficult and Not Much Fun,"This book takes the fun out of carving jack o lanterns. It contains two designs that are done step by step, but both take hours and hours to complete. I'm not sure I have that kind of time to put into carving a gnome. I was hoping for some tips on how to turn someone's face into a carving or something like that. Instead there are just some examples of stuff I didn't like. I spent at least 6 hours on a pumpkin and when it was done, I have to say that it didn't turn out to be spooky or gross, so I wasn't happy. I carved a puking pumpkin as well and more people commented on that than the carved one. The puking pumpkin only took a couple of minutes.This might be a good book for a grandpa or someone with a lot of time on their hands. For most halloween types, I think it is sort of uncool."
5,Finally a book explaining the scary joy of power tools and carving.,Finally a book that explains the art of power tool carving to create scary and entertaining pumpkin stories. You will never look at a cutsie pumpkin again without thinking about how it can be lit on fire.
4,PURE ITALIAN POP MUSIC,"If you enjoy female vocalists and Italians, than you can't miss this sublime cocktail !!"
5,Nice well made bag.,"Have used this bag for a couple of years. It is sturdy and can handle any amount of weight you can stuff in it. Only tool bag I own and I LIKE IT. There are lots of good well made bags available. Any of them will do you good, I'm sure. I picked this one cause it was simple and looked strong. I would buy it again, if I needed a second or third one for more tools, or if it was ever stolen. Cause I doubt it will wear out, or break before I do."
1,cost is an outrage!,"I recieved my 2# box with the 3oz. device inside. This is cheap thin foam with some stable plastic pieces in front and back. When I saw it, I thought, ""I paid $34.00 for this?"" Look for the old fashion kind that dosn't let your neck move, because this device is not worth beans."
2,"4 1/4"" philadelphia cervical collar","The product received on time, however, the item is a mismatch, the front part and the back part is not perfectly match eachother, extremely hard to line up right. The price of cause is much cheaper than the regular local drug store, I wish they should mentioned ""irregular"" before I have purchased, that make understanding before order. The product still work, but not comfortablely match."
3,"Great when they work, But Beware! You cannot return this item","These are great when they work; however, this is the second time I received a defective refill. When you put the top on the can it continually releases the gas until it is empty. Beware! You cannot return this item, so basically you get screwed if they are defective."
4,Coolwiz,"The stay away or scat air cans work very well, just so expensive for a can of compressed air that does not last long. So I started experimenting with air duster can used for blowing dust off computers. First I took off the top of the can ( the spray trigger ). It takes some force to remove but it does come off. After that just clip on the motion detector. And one last step. Turn the can upside down or lay flat. See, inside the stay away of sscat can refills there is a tube that goes to the bottom Of the can and this picks up the liquid in the can. The air duster cans don't have this tube inside so its necessary to turn the can and sensor upside down or on its side. This way no need to buy 12.00-15.00 dollar refills. Instead you can get four cans of computer air duster cans for the same price as one stay away or sscat refill. Plus the air dister cans are bigger."
3,Bit pricey,This product does work on preventing my cats wandering the off limit area of the house. But I think it's just a bit pricey and doesn't last that long.
2,Inconsistent,Just wouldn't react quick enough when any 3 of my dogs came close. Disappointing. Wasted sounds and air to test that it should work.
5,Thank you!,"Great product. As soon as it goes off, the cat jumps off the counter where he should not be."
4,It works,"This particular product emits a sound in addition to the puff of air. I prefer it over my first spray system that only emitted air. Once the cat gets blasted by air a couple times in ""no-cat"" zones, the sound will usually keep them away if they try again. This saves on the expensive refills. I bought a refill with the system, but doubt I'll use it. My cat is a nervous one, though, so she learned real quick to avoid the protected area.One difficulty is positioning the motion sensor to keep the cat away, yet to not go off every time a human passes in the vicinity."
1,I would not purchase this product,YOU CANNOT RETURN the StayAway Motion Activated products. I purchase 12 and 4 do not work. Money thrown away.
3,STAYAWAY WITH MINOR DRAWBACK-EASY TO CORRECT!,"This product works effectively in keeping my cat from jumping on countertops. Good news for one and all who are concerned about cost of canisters, a regular can of compressed air works after prying off the top and replacing with Stayaway top. Stayaway alarm & sprayer work great on most any aerosol can. Saves so much $$$$$ since compressed air is generally $2.50/can (I buy them whenever they are on sale $2/can). Now my cat just see's the can and runs! LOL I correct my initial rating since I contacted the company and they refused to sell the alarm part only. I offered $20 per top. No surprise since they can sucker folks into re-purchasing canister in some cases,"
1,buy CatScram instead,I bought both stayway and catscram. The refill canister on stayway is too expensive. I needed it in a high traffic area. No refills on catscram just buy the AC adapter and you are ready to go.
3,Pricey but interchangable,"I have not been able to get the Sccat refills anywhere on line. However, the remote unit for Sccat fits right on top of the Stay Away cannisters."
3,Not enough ummmph,"I have participated in parades during carnival in the West Indies. I had expected more of a workout of soca, reggae, etc similar to what is done during the road march portion of J'ouvert. None the less, for a novice, the dvd would be ok. I probably will not watch the dvd again."
5,Parlez-vous Anglais?,"This book is amazing. I am a French student in a beginning French class at a four-year university. The book goes through every part of speech, explains it, and compares how they function in sentences in English and Frnech. Morton's book helps to understand how parts of speech are used in the set-up of sentences in French. I highly recommend this to anyone learning the language of French.English Grammar for Students of French: The Study Guide for Those Learning French"
4,Excellent French language resource,How much do you know about English language? You may think you know a lot until you start to study a foreign language. This book is very helpful to lay out the grammar of English as you learn the grammar of French.
5,Bonjour,"THis is a book that I had to buy for French Class at school, it is brand spankin new, and I love it!"
4,Very helpful so far,"After having taken three years of french a long time ago in high school, I am now taking beginning French as an adult. When I took it as a teen-ager, I never felt like I really understood things grammatically. Part of the reason, quite frankly, was my poor understanding of English grammar.So when I saw this title, I took a gamble and purchased it. So far, it has been very useful to me. I have been studying it in addition to my classroom textbook. And I have been using it as a reference when I don't understand something in the textbook. So for me, I give it a definite thumbs up. And the size is nice, too. Not too big and bulky but packed with information."
4,English Grammar for Students of French,"There is no faster way to realize how little you know about the structures of the English language until you start taking a foreign language. This is a great resource book for people learning French. It gives easy to understand explanations for grammar rules and provides mini quizzes with the answers in the back to test your knowledge a little. My main complaint is while the book provides examples in both English and French, I think there should be more."
5,Must have,"This book is a must have for any French student who has forgotten all the grade-school English grammar terminology and rules. If you are completely lost when sentence structure is brought up in french class, buy this book. As a first year french student this book has been very useful."
3,Mamet's book an interesting guide for students,I have a bachelor's degree in theatre. I was impressed by the essays in this book. They cover anything from script writing the the nature or art. Mamet is one of my favorite writers. I especially enjoy Oleanna. A must read for any Mamet fan. This book presents excellent essays for class discussion or as a source for a paper.
3,too small,"this is such a cute outfit, but the skirt did not fit and I ordered a bigger size than I really am. unfortunately I had to return."
4,You And Me Were Gonna Be Partners,M&L's next to last film is one of their funniest and shows how much better their movies got into the mid 50s. The prolouge even has M&L playing it totally straight. Some great gags and appearances by some familiar Western character actors give this a fine satiric bite. And don't miss the last shot after Dean & Jerry shoot away the THE END title where they talk directly to the audience and imply that they won't break up.
3,Dean and Jerry on the Range,"""Pardners"" (1956) was Martin and Lewis' next-to-last film and it remains among their best. A loose remake of Bing Crosby's ""Rhythm on the Range"" (1936), this breezy western comedy has the duo in good form, with a strong supporting cast featuring Agnes Moorehead and Lon Chaney Jr. Unlike ""Hollywood or Bust"" (the team's farewell appearance), Dean and Jerry were on speaking terms during the production and their rapport is evident from beginning to end. One of the film's most memorable (and ironic) scenes has Martin and Lewis taking aim at the final credits, while assuring their fans that they will continue to make beautiful cinema together. It didn't turn out that way, but you have to admire Dean and Jerry for breaking up at the height of their phenomenal success - rather than face the downhill trajectory that greeted most comedy teams."
3,Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis,The VHS movie is in Great shape and the movie plays Ok . I just wish I could have gotten it on a DVD instead of a VHS
2,1/2 good,"I purchased 2 of these bars for my truck and with barely any use over a couple of months, one spring flew out during normal ratcheting rendering it useless. Early oxidation is a given if exposed to the elements for any length of time. They were relatively inexpensive and the quality is reflective of this. They are cheap bars which do not last. I'm currently searching for a quality replacement."
1,it did not last,"The ratchet broke on the third use, I would not recommend buying this item it simply did not last, POS."
3,Works as advertised but too weak to hold at max extension!,"Tried this on my full sized Tundra bed and it works pretty easily once you work with it a little, however, at the max extension which is needed for that full size pickup, it's too flimsy to hold with any confidence. If I had a smaller truck I think this bar would be awesome or if you try to use it between the wheel wells maybe but at it's max extension I don't have confidence it would hold anything that wanted to move. Regrettably I am returning it."
1,Junk....Don't waste your money,Spend the extra $5 or $10 and get the better one. First thing that happened was the ratcheting system give and that was only after the first day.
2,Loose,Assembly makes bar feel loose when in place. They need to make another position fine adjustment for that in between adjustment.
2,poor,"I really didn't like 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag--though the premise is a good one. It's just that Schulman's writing didn't quite work out. The dialogue was stilted and made little sense and there was a little too much ludicrous comedy in the film. Pesci gave a good performance, but far from its best. It was just a poor effort."
2,don't waste your time,"Like another reviewer said - this should be funny. At times it almost gets to be funny but at no point, i repeat, at no point is it ever actually funny. This is a waste of a good hour and a half of your life. Don't rent it, try something else instead. The story is infantile, the direction pitiful and the acting is piss poor. This is the director's first effort so do both him and yourself a favour and skip this flick. I'm sure this particular director can do better and the less people who see this movie the better for him!"
1,Some kind of bad.,"This film is like nails on a blackboard. Not one smart thing about it. It was marketed as a dark comedy along the lines of ""Pulp Fiction,"" but it's more on the level of ""Private Resort."" Grindingly unfunny."
4,How can you not laugh at that........,"If you're a fan of movies like Very Bad Things, Clay Pigeons, and Grosse Point Blank or atleast have a decent sense of humor and can handle a bit of bad taste in the name of good humor, then here's one more winner for you. Admittedly, this is not the best work of any of the ""known"" actors involved, but is a comedy ever where you expect the academy award for best actor to shine. Watch the movie because you're looking to laugh and just let it out as the heads roll. I'm still waiting for a release on DVD...."
3,Good light comedy without excessive silliness,"This was a nice light comedy with some really interesting sight gags, but without being overly silly. Joe Pesci was his usual tough-as-nails gangster type and Spade provided his customary sarcasm. The film had some wonderfully funny moments, the best of which was the final airport scene."
2,Lost Your Head(s)?,"Tommy Spinelli (Joe Pesci) is handed a duffel bag with eight heads that once belonged to eight mobsters. He is told to deliver the heads within 24 hours or he will lose his own head. This should be no problem for a veteran mobster like Tommy, but problems appear when he gets on the plane and a stewardess moves his bag into another luggage compartment. When Tommy gets off the plane he realizes that he has someone else's bag. 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag is a tedious film without aim that tries to rely on situational comedy and the occasionally moments when Joe Pesci shines up the screen."
2,a bunch of silly actors,"I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in the ""right mood"" for this movie But the biggest problem with this comedy was actually quite simple: it just wasn't funny. I remember watching the first 30 minutes or so and suddenly realizing that nobody in the theatre was laughing at anything...including me! Sure, a couple of small things were humorous, but for the most part, the jokes just sat there, waiting for a response."
4,JOE PESCI IS FUNNY AS ALWAYS,"A MOB HITMAN [JOE PESCI] LOSES A DUFFEL BAG THAT CONTAINS THE HEADS OF 8 DEAD PEOPLE AND HE GOES ON A QUEST TO GET IT BACK. GOOD IDEA AND IT WORKS OUT PRETTY WELL. OTHER THAN JOE PESCI, WHO'S FUNNY AS ALWAYS, DAVID SPADE HAD SOME FUNNY MOMENTS AS WELL. IF YOU NEED SOME GOOD LAUGHS, GET THIS MOVIE NOW."
3,not great but not bad,"Joe Pesci, David Spade, and Todd Louiso are the ones who keep this movie interesting and funny. Oh, and the lady who plays the grandmother. Everyone else seems be going through a ""bad acting"" virus. Veterans George Hamilton and Dyan Cannon just seem like they'e only doing this movie because work for them is hard to come by these days. And who is that John Cusack wannabe who is the star of the movie? This movie would have better off with the real John Cusack. But joe, David, and Todd provide all the comic relief for this dark comedy.The movie is about a duffel bag switch at the airport, one of which contains 8 heads being delivered for the mob. That says it all right there.In some stores, this dvd is available for a very good price. If you find it at one of those stores, I definitely recommend this dvd. Fans of Joe Pesci will also be impressed with this dvd."
4,8 Heads in a Duffel Bag,"This is a great movie. Joe Pesci is hysterical in everything he's in! Of course, David Spade is equally funny. I thought Andy Comeau did an awesome job as well. Don't know that I'd ever seen him before but would definitely like to see him in more comedies. Some movies aren't as funny as you remember, especially 14 years later, but this one definitely was."
4,Carry a smile in your pocket or purse,"If I didn't see my children every day, I'd want one of these. This is a perfect gift for, say, a grandparent who lives far away.Why carry one picture when you can carry many? The image quality is webcam-grade, but it's definitely good enough to let you appreciate the photos. Close-ups are definitely recommended; crop any unimportant objects.I've worked in IT for over 7 years. This photo keychain is so easy to use that even the technology-challenged will be able to put photos onto it. It requires a standard 5-pin USB cable, but it might include one (Sorry, I forgot).This device seems to be built of durable materials, and should withstand the abuse of life in a bag or purse. I don't know the actual dimensions, but it's big enough to handle, without being cumbersome.UPDATE: Less than 6 months since this was given as a gift, the device stopped working and will not turn on after troubleshooting and replacing the battery."
1,FOUR! OUCH!,"Purchased 3 for gifts. Gave the first 1. Defective. Gave the 2nd 1. Defective. Thank goodness I had a 3rd to have her try. Emailed TAO 10/21/07. Respone on 11/13/07. No assitance and/or help with replacement. SOOO. Returned 2 defective devices via Amazon/Target. ESTIMATED SHIP date for replacements, 12/31/07. To late for XMAS. A Blessing? Please research functionality, support software and quality before buying. I wish I would have before I paid for a product that has filling station counter quality and value."
3,"Great idea, not perfect design","I bought this as a gift for my 80+ year old uncle, to show off photos when he goes visiting. I liked the idea of a keyring combined with a photo albums. Holding 56 photos provides an adequate amount of photos. I also liked the packaging, especially considering I wanted to give it as a gift.I know that 1.5"" versions are available, but the 1.4"" is rather small for anyone, young or old, to see pictures very clearly - you have to get the larger version. The keychain must be used with the provided software, which only allows you to download pictures to the keychain; Therefore you cannot use a TV or computer with a larger screen to show these photos to others.Good idea, good gift, not as flexible as I would have liked it to be."
3,"Nice concept, bad instructions","My wife bought this for me for Father's Day, and sent it to me overseas (deployed in the military). She had put several pictures on, of our new daughter, so that I could see recent pictures of her. One of the pictures didn't go on properly, so I read the instructions to figure out how to delete it. The instructions say to press the back button for 4 seconds to delete all photos, and the press the forward button for 4 seconds to delete the current photo. That's backwards; it's the other way around. Also, all this does is ASK if you want to delete the photos, but you have to press the power button to actually delete the photo. Long story short, I ended up deleting all of the photos because the instructions are screwed up and backwards. I figured it out, but not until after I had deleted all of the pictures of my new baby daughter, 7500 miles from home. The instructions could be just a little simpler (and correct)."
4,Amazing Novelty,"I purchased this keychain for my 16 year old sister for Christmas. It has got to be th neatest item out on the market right now. The software is extremely user friendly. Although the picture is not perfectly clear, it is a small screen and given that fact, the picture quality is good for what you pay! The keychain can hold so many photos and presents its own slideshow, it's a clever way to show off photos without actually carrying your digital camera or photographys around with you! I recommend this item, it's a neat little novelty to have around!"
4,Cool,"Works well enough. Not the most amazing screen in the world, but for the price, it is a nice little gadget. Got it for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it!"
3,"Nifty idea, underwhelming picture quality","I thought this would make a good gift -- buy it for somebody, load it with photos, repackage -- that way, when they receive it, it is ready to use and personalized. It arrived okay, the instructions were okay to follow, software installed alright. Software it easy enough to use. The size of the display is what I expected. But the quality is disappointing. I was expecting image quality something like the display on a digital camera. Instead, it is something closer to cell phone quality photos. Better than that, but still not quite impressive. Good gift for somebody who doesn't take a lot of pictures. Nice slideshow mode, holds plenty of pictures (50?)."
5,Digital Keychain,"I ordered many digital photo keychains for Christmas to compare the quality. The Tao 1.4 inch digital photo keychain had the best display. This was the only one I found that had an AC adaptor which was necessary for those older individuals on my gift list who did not have a computer. To view the pictures, you should hold the keychain away from you and at a slight angle. This will yield the best picture. The only problems were you could not pick your pictures and then arrange them in the order you wished to view them. In order to be able to see the picture clearly, you must zoom in on the face. Overall, I believe this is the best digital keychain out there to date."
3,The big picture,Purchased this for a friend who had twins I uploaded the photographs after it charged and discovered that the image looked okay at best when looking at the screen you can see the individual pixels that make up the image something that does not have to be as I own a digital camera and the screen on the back of the camera has a much sharper natural look.This product is disappointing.
3,Cool but don't get your expectations to high,Very very cool gift! But screen quality isn't very good. Screen quality is like a color screen cell phone from 1997. But very easy to put pictures on it and its very cool. I don't regret buying six of them for my friends even though the screen was less than expected.
4,Very nice for what it is.,"Like the title says, it is a very nice product for what it is. The only down side is because the screen is so small, some of the details in the pictures are lost. But, it was bought because it was small. So, on the plus side, it is small and for the size, the pictures are pretty good. It will hold 62 pictures. I like that you can go picture by picture or start a slideshow. The software that comes with it to load the device is easy to use but it is very basic. I have not found a way to re-order the pictures. But, that aside, I like it. You can also save your 'project' or the series of pictures that you loaded. This is nice if there are a couple of sets of pictures that you want to swap in and out. The device can be charged through the USB cable with your computer or with an included AC adaptor. It comes in a very nice box which was nice because it was a gift. So, all-in-all, I like it and the price is very good compared to a full size digital frame."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product and so easy to use. The pictures are so clear you won't belive it. And it holds 56 of them! I gave one to every one of my nieces (all teens) for Christmas and let me tell you, it was the hit of Christmas. I also recommend it for grandpas and gandmas to hold all those pictures of grandkids and other family members. So much lighter than carrying a picture book around. If you don't know how to use a computer I'm sure your grandchildren will be happy download the software and help you with this. It will be worth it as this little gadget amazed everyone I showed it to. I can't emphasize enough how absolutely clear the photos were after I downloaded them into the viewer. In fact, I bought one for everyone but myself so I went back and purchased one for me."
2,Disappointing gift,"I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day, so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy. Unfortunately, the images appeared for one day, and then the unit stopped working. We had to send the unit back. I was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item."
5,super cool....great gift idea,Gave it to my favorite grad when she headed off to New York...filled it with family and home photos...she loves it!
2,Neat but obsolete.,"Bought this for my wife for mothers day last year. She couldn't even tell you where it is right now. But, this was before we had camera phones. Now that we have them, there was not much interest in this."
1,Very Poor Quality Display - Over Priced,"The simulated picture of this product is a huge fake. After spending an hour choosing and editing photos using the TAO software I was hugely disappointed at the very poor display quality. You can easily see each individual pixel in the display, and you can't make out more then 60% of the pictures I transfered to the keychain. Its even worse that the company preloads this device with pictures perfectly optimized for the display to give you a false sense of hope that your pictures may look ok. This would be a fun toy for maybe $15 dollars but this currently is huge rip off and a poor quality product."
1,Don't bother,"The product image uses a simulated picture. On the real device, I can literally see and count the individual pixels of the display. Don't waste your money on this type of item util the resolution is greatly improved."
2,If you have good eyesight don't buy,"I have the Brookstone version and it is the same make. I don't usually write reviews but I felt obligated to since I feel people shouldn't waste money and time to return. I bought it for my wife and was excited to have it all set up with pictures as she opened it for Christmas. To my disappointment the picture quality was horrible. I tried the resizing and nothing helped (have been working with digital pictures for the past 7 years...7,000+ pictures now). The only thing that did look decent was a full face shot with nothing else but the face (even that wasn't that great but at least viewable). Don't buy if you have any sense of enjoying a decent picture. Also was alot bulkier that I expected - a bit much for carrying around on a keychain. Gave 2 stars for the ease of the software. 1 star for picture quality."
1,don't bother,Picture quality is so BAD the item should be sold for $5 or $10 bucks. Great idea but techonogy is poor. Wait until next year when someone else can get it right.
1,A total dud,I downloaded the software for the mac. When I ran it the first time the pictures on the key chain overlapped so I deleted them and tried again. This time the software hung and I had to force it to quit. The key chain was then itself in a loop and there was no way to reset it. This is really a poor design. (The review form won't let me rate this zero but that is my real rating)
2,"Not bad, if you don't expect too much","The comments others have made regarding the advertising for the picture keychain are accurate - the picture is misleading the image resolution on the actual device does not come close to that quality. Having said that, it is nice to have 50+ photos on a device that I can throw in my purse. Because I am familiar with everything I've loaded, I can still enjoy the fond memories associated with the photos, even though the resolution is adequate, at best. Software is easy to use. Probably overpriced at $50. If it had cost 1/2 that amount I wouldn't feel like complaining."
3,Small but great!,The photos are very small. I knew that when I ordered the keychain but I wasn't prepared for how very small that really was! Other than that..it's a great little product.
4,TAO Digital Picture Keychain,"I got this device for my wife to hold pictures of the grandkids. The pictures are easy to load. They do appear slightly grainy on the 1.25"" x 1.0 inch display but overall we are very pleased with the operation. It must be recharged periodically depending upon how much one is bragging about their grandkids but that works very well also, charging off of the separate charger or when connected to the USB port on the computer. I am not sorry I bought it."
2,Cell phone or iPod is more practical for pics,"I bought this for my wife a year ago as a Valentine's day gift.Over the last year, she's used it maybe 3 or 4 times.It's simply not practical to have an extra device that requires access and charging. The display is definitely a little fuzzy, as I've seen indicated in other reviews. That was never really my biggest concern, since my expectations in this price range were low. It's just the inconvenient nature of loading the photos and keeping in charged that is kind of a pain.This is ok as a novelty item, but it will end up in your ""junk drawer"" sooner, rather than later. Put the money into a decent storage iPod or other music player and call it a day."
4,for gadget gurus,"My dad likes gadgets and this one kept him busy. Since he still doesn't have a digital camera, he used it to download photos of the Internet and was very pleased."
4,Great Book for E-Commerce Beginners,The Clickable Corporation is an excellent overview book for those who want to START understanding the e-commerce and how to apply it in their own business. It is very practical (the use of case stories around 8 key themes) and lacks pretence or jargon that intimidates in many other publications.
2,That's just great... now what about me?,"If you want to hear a whoppingly good reivew of a job well done, this is the book for you. If you want to know the ups and downs of how they did it, look further. This overivew of one good effort after another gives scant to no insight into the machinations of their business plans, strategies, challenges, or process focus. While Seinfed may believe ""not that there's anything wrong with that..."" it is a canvassing of top seed efforts that leaves the reader very little better off than before."
3,Interesting but lacked a theme or depth,"Clickable corporation is like a survey course in eCommerce. The book contains sketchy overviews of 25 companies applying eCommerce with limited information or structure. Read the book if you are interested in finding out what some people have acheived in eCommerce. I would not bother with the book if you are looking to find something to apply to your company as it moves in to eCommerce. However, if you want to impress your friends with your breadth of knowledge regarding eCommerce, this might be the book for you.The book would have been better if it provided a structure to on how to think through issues so we could take action."
1,This book tells you nothing of importance.,"If you have paid any attention to business over the internet, this book well bore you to tears. I found it to be a complete waist of money. I am interested in starting an internet business and this book was full of obvious information about companies that most people already know. I would have given it zero stars if I could."
1,Amazon Sucks,"I ordered a new pressure washer and you sent me a used one with oil all over the inside of the box. I'm pissed. I thought that a web site like amazon.com would not go so low as to dupe a coustomer. I am returning this item and I will not buy anything else from Amazon.com. I will tell all my friends that ask me what I think about amazon.com, not to buy anything from them. Even thought shipping this pressure washer back will cost me the shippihg, it's OK as long as I get rid of this peice of this thing. I'm am very disspointed with this service.---------------"
4,def for hard core surf fans...,"How 'core' is the newest Woodshed Productions One Track Mind? NONE of the surfers interviewed are 'labelled' - it is assumed that we already know who the many talking heads presented in this film really are. Which is fine, if you play surfer magazine's ASP tour pool and have a broad knowledge of the sport. And make no mistake - the focus in this movie is on surfing as a hard core competitive sport - most if not all the footage seems to be from the ASP/WQS tour. The surfing is at an absolutely stellar level, but viewers looking for more soul stoke might want to go elsewhere, like investigating The Present; Thomas Campbell's (Sprout)superb new surf doc. The music - My Morning Jacket, Shins, Rogue Wave - is outstanding. Some great Dane Reynolds footage, too..."
5,Killer,"OTM has it all: Like every woodshed flick there is a great soundtrack. exceptional surfing, and stunning footage. A little different than other woodsheds in that there is actual interview footage spliced in with the surfing segments, however this ends up creating a great story line and provides a interesting look at some of the most influential and progressive players in the game. $25 will get you this film or a case of beer in canada. My advice is get your hands on $50, and get beer AND the movie, and enjoy."
2,quantity over quality,"Why the need for 2 CDs? 1 CD of the best of the tracks would've earned this album 4/5. As such it puts me to sleep. This is mostly violins and other strings, too little guitar playing.That stand out cuts are#12: Wow! Was I listening to Pink Floyd here? Haunting.#17: same as 12 but slower.#19: pretty good too."
2,More Drago please,"Well, I would have never bought this movie if it didn't have Billy Drago in it. Unfortunately, the movie makes little sense and has really bad actors in it. Billy Drago himself has got so much more potential and I hope to see him soon again on a major big screen. These cheesy quick to video type selections are getting old and I would like to see the ""Bad Boy Billy"" as a drug lord again like in the old Delta Force 2 days."
2,BLOOD RELIC,What can you suspect from this movie? The acting wasn't that bad but the whole story was probably thought up from a thirteen year old. The only reason I'm giving this film 2 stars is because it's an independent film and it looked as if the director tried to make a good horror film.
1,a reader from the usa,"what a wacked out book thought it was complete garbage and i cant believe the author would expect intelligent adults to swallow this stuff. its quite a sad state of affairs when a grown adult author takes the ideas of guardian angels literally, IS THIS GUY FOR REAL"
1,review,well what can i say about these books the first time i read them i nearly fell off my chair laughing i thought they were so absurd im positive that the author must be a cracked pot the language makes absolutely no sense what so ever its almost like he has added a gallon of words to a pot stirred them around and published them it really is a load of nonsensical waffle. and as for this spirit he is talking to well where on earth did he even dream up such a name definetely a case for the nut house
2,Did not fit 7 cup Cuisinart,Pusher if fine but too thick to go all the way down in my DC-7-. I was disappointed by this pusher
4,Accurate Comic-Book Presentation of Basic Genetics,"Can be understood by nonscientists. This book is best appreciated by aspiring biologist. Book lacks most current information concerning genetics, i.e. Gene Cloning and the Human Genome Project. Overall is an outstanding easy read that accurately covers many important concepts in genetics."
2,Booklet not a book,"This is a booklet.....28 pages long. For people familiar with plants,it is my opinion this book offers very little information that is not already available online. I am disappointed."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book for helping you think thru yourplay on the golf course. Read Armour's ""How to PlayYour Best Golf All the Time Book"" first to master thefundamentals of the game, then hit the links with thisbook and your well on your way to a great round of golf."
4,Superb MP3 player,"Wow, I am more than enthusiastic about everything with regards this excellent machine, from the style of the machine, to the operation of it and the software used to transfer music files. Using SonicStage 3.1 I have no trouble with converting files from CD or transferring directly as MP3. As is usual the headphones that come with it are second rate but as I already have a pair of Shure E2c's I can assure you the sound is second to none (and I have listened to several players before purchasing this one, the equaliser gives just the sound the response you may require. Its ability to view slide shows of your own photo's is a good addition plus being able to transfer directly from my Cybershot camera means no more lugging my laptop away on holiday to transfer my pics once the camera memory card is full. All in all a very easy to use, superb sounding piece of kit."
2,Looks great sounds less than Ok at best settings.,"I am glad to see Sony enter the Hard Drive MP3 player arena. This unit has great features great looks and a great feel. It falls way short however on sound quality. Compared to my current MP3 player, Pogo Products RipDrive, this unit just doesn't deliver a clear, rich or powerful sound. I tried ripping my CD's at all possible quality settings and types and the sound was not close enough to my RipDrive unit to keep me from being dissapointed. The Sony VGF-AP1L wins hands down on style looks and size. If you want to show off to your friends this looks great, but if you want to impress your ears try a RipDrive."
1,Just Ok,"This book is a compilation of many newspaper articles and facts written about the Shah. There is nothing new here except for a heavy book with lots of misspellings and typos. Many pages are devoted to characters that come in contact with the royal family during their exile (i.e. Manuel Noriega, Omar torrijos etc.)and very little written about the private side of his life and his dealings with his family, friends and close aids."
5,Fast & accurate -- what more do you want??,"I bought the SBOX8 box joint cutter to make 20 decorative boxes for our woodclub's Toys for Kids Christmas project - The older kids need something nice too. This mini-dado is not cheap but does a first-class job of cutting accurate box joints. Once you make up the spacing jig to attach to your miter, you can crank out box sides very quickly. I was using some 1/4 veneered plywood and had very, very minor chipout. Much less than the 1/4 brand-new spiral cut router bit I first tried to use to cut the joints. I always say to buy the best tool you can afford, it's usually money well spent and the SBOX8 is worth every penny.LOU"
5,Can't ask for much more,"The quality of the blades is great, there is a LOT of carbide on these teeth. I had no problems installing the blades or building the jig, the instructions were very clear.The cuts are very nice, no tearout, only minor splintering with plywood. Certainly no worse than ripping or crosscutting plywood with a regular blade.Tip: If possible, secure the jig to your miter gauge using a bolt rather than a screw. I simply countersunk a hole on the ""blade"" side of the jig and epoxied in a nut. This prevents the screw hole from slipping after a while."
3,Freud Box Joint Cutter,Good product. Good delivery. Would like to have been able to cut wider grooves on a single pass.
5,A must have,"This box joint cutter set should be in every woodworkers arsenal of blades. Professional or Hobbyist. Use a quality jig for cutting the joints, I found this makes a big difference. You will not be disappointed."
1,Misleading description,"Note that this item does NOT have a OHV engine. Check Briggs and Stratton website, it states it has the quantum engine. The rating is for the description, not the pressure washer itself since I bought a different one after learning of the lack of a OHV engine."
3,The Maintenance Man,"Pretty good movie, could've been longer to explain what one's wife did with her pregnancy by another man and it could've shown her raising the child, but pretty good."
4,THE MAINTENANCE MAN,"THE MOVIE QAUILTY IS REALLY GOOD & AMAZON WAS REALLY GOOD W/SHIPPING IT FAST & THE ONLY REASON I'M GIVING THIS A 4 STARS, BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF STORY LINE SUCKED IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD MOVIE BUT BAD ACTING."
4,Good Play,"Well, my wife said it wasnt like the book,but even still being that I havent read the book myself. I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed Arnez J, that cat is funny, even when he is serious he is funny. Check it out, if you love Black Theather, its a must have along side your Tyler Perry collection."
3,ok but missing something,this play was a let down to me. I have the play men cry in the dark and it was much better than this one which was also a book by michael baisden.
2,the maintenance man,i like the first one better it was made in about early 2000's i really would like to get three copys if i can find them it was really a good one and the maintenance man really good looking and he could sing too if anyone knows where i can get it would be great i have been lookin for three years thanks
3,The Maintenance Man,"This was a nice play. Nice to see little ""Eddie Winslow"" (Darius McCrary)in a grown up role."
5,Awesome,"This is an awesome play. This is actually my second copy. I really enjoyed this play. In my opinion the book is a little bit more detailed, but the play is great. The actors bring life to the characters."
4,Enjoyable.,Powerful message in this play and I loved how the writer transformed the lead character by the end of the play. It was a pleasure to see Arnez J. portray a more dramatic character. There was alot of profanity in this play that was a distraction for me.
2,the maintenance man,"if i had not read the book before seeing the play i would not had brought the play. i did not enjoy the play, because there is no way a play can give you what a book or movie can tell you. the book was good it gave you food for your imagination. the movie when made will only give you more food for thought. i would not suggest buying the play. i would suggest buying the book and go see the movie when it come out.the movie is going to be made this year or next if they have not started on it already."
5,Ja'Caryous has done it again!!,This play was great! All of the actors were funny and Darius-Oh My God!! can he sing or what!! I watched this play every night when I first got it for about 3weeks straight and I still watch it now. This was just awesome! I hadn't read the book but I'm going to now.
5,Maintenance Men,"This was an excellent play. I didn't think I could got passed remembering him as his character from ""Family Matters, but five minutes into the play, I realized there was no comparison. Darius is now a mature and confident young man. If your looking for laughs (Arnez J) and sometimes tears (Billy D., this is a good DVD to purchase."
5,excellent after shave,this is a wonderful after shave lotion with a delightful light perfume that lasts all the day and into the evening. absolutely the best and i have used it for years would never change to another.
1,It's Easier for a Camel,Pan this movie. Open frontal nudity of father being washed in bed and other bad scenes. Very disconnected. No redeeming value and lots of greed and selfishness and sex. Do not buy/not worth the money.
1,avoid,"never worked. seriously, right out of the box - it never worked. you've got to be kidding me. I'm not kidding you - it NEVER worked. it didn't break after one play, or two plays. it didn't work.....ever."
1,Will be returning the SECOND one!,"We purchased this cd player for our son to listen to at night at bedtime. It appealed to us because it seemed to be built pretty tough and seemed to be un-cluttered and easy enough for a four year old to use. It never worked quite right. Most of the time it did not work at all. It finally just stopped working and Target exchanged it for us without any problem. After about six months, the replacement unit is now not working. This time I hope that Target will just refund us. Pass this one up."
1,J-U-N-K Junk.,"Received and the CD door would not stay closed. Piece of junk. What a hassle. Would you normally buy a Memorex boombox? You get what you pay for, but this thing isn't worth $20. You're paying for the Disney branding. AVOID."
4,desperately trying to breastfeed,"I am an OB nurse, so naturally I wanted to breast feed my children after they were born. I had a lot of frustration and pain trying to breast feed my first child, and subsequently stopped after 5 weeks. I was more determinded with my second and third child to be successful. My postpartum nurse (and friend) reccommended this book to me and it was a life saver. I don't neccessarily agree with all of the La Leche League's views, but found it easy to pick out the useful information and skip the ""theory"" part of it. I ended up breastfeeding my second child for 7 months, and my third for 10 months. Considering my goal was 6 months, I think I did pretty good."
1,worst book I ever read,"This is absolutely the worst book I ever read - clipped sentences, inaccurate and just wrong information. I have a Ph.D. in Music Theory, and this book is a joke. I would learn more from the old basic program ""Eliza"", that echoes back your own questions. This is not just a poorly written book, it is also wrong. This is music theory at it's worst, and I have seen some pretty sorry teachers, especially at my own college. I am surprised that Amazon.com will agree to sell this book.John Francis"
1,Ridiculous,"It's hard to believe that Mr Kaye found a publisher for a text that is so incoherent and so poorly written.It's even harder to believe that AuthorHouse published a text with so many typos. These typos, by the way, are so consistent and repetitive that they are probably not typos. Really, this is but an illiterate first draft that never went through even one round of editing.For example, p xxii:""And their output was enormous right along with it. Had Bach have known this would subsequently be a factor.""Basically the whole book is like this, making you wonder about the mental sanity of both the writer and the publisher.A complete waste of time."
4,The Best of Junior,"""Mama used to say"" was the reason I bought the CD. I found the rest of the disc above-average. For Junior fans - get it at a good price and enjoy it. For others, borrow the disk from someone and give it a chance, you may end up buying it for yourself! Four stars!!"
3,This could have been better.,"It's great to have some classics from Junior on CD but unfortunately some of his other 12"" classics have to sit this one out. Let Me Know and I Can't Help It were two other songs that were remixed by the Legendary Tee Scott and were the only versions I was familiar with. I never heard them on the radio. Communication Breakdown was yet another song that was a 12"" remix but only the LP version makes it here. A song that did not make it at all was Tell Me which came from Inside Lookin' Out."
1,Missing episodes,"This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is..."
5,People Need To Learn How To Complain,This is a great show. I just wish that the rating for it wasn't full of people complaining about the unbox service. I for one have not had any problems with the service but then I know what I am doing. By the way Abby is the best character ever on any show.
3,This is no Psalm 69,"If you never thought you could dance to Ministry without moshing, you've never heard this CD. I bought it for ""Everyday is Halloween"" which is also featured in the Wax Trax Black Box collection. It has a more techno/trance/dance sound than their newer work. If you are one of those who likes hardcore Psalm 69 stuff (and who doesn't?) and you want more of that, you won't find it here. However, if you are into something a little bit different that has hypnotic electronic melodies with slightly distorted vocals (I assume) then try this one out."
3,"""Nature Of Love"" RULES","""Nature of Love"" is the best Ministry song ever! ""Halloween"" is awesome, too, but the rest of this album is remixes and garbage. You might want to get this anyway 'cause it's cheaper to buy this than the two singles."
1,"If this is Ministry, i'm cashing in my chips!","This is not Ministry!!! I followed them through the years, and I 've heard bands take a turn for the worst, BUT THIS TAKES A DIVE!!! The songs sound suffocating to the originals(if they aren't taped) and they make a fools paradise to the listener looking for the new cutting edge of Ministy! Ministry has a name to live up to, Retake this album!!! I don't reccomend it for indusrial listeners"
3,OK,"Classic synth-pop with a dark edge (which culminated with the classic Twitch album), but there are only 4 songs with a mix for each. Parts of the mixes easily annoy, so this album is only for those who crave the style.I STILL say anything done by Ministry AFTER Twitch is HORRIBLE"
3,How much do you like 'Cold Life'??,"Unless you love the early Ministry track 'Cold Life' a WHOLE lot, you're better off leaving this collection on the shelf and plumping for 'Early Trax' instead. That album does a much better job of chronicling the synthpop/electronic sound of mid 80's Ministry. It contains the remaining three tracks featured here, plus a number of other songs from the period, to provide a more comprehensive introduction to what Ministry were about way back then.While 'Twelve Inch Singles' contains some great music ('Everyday is Halloween' is a dead set club classic), the reality is it only features FOUR songs. The remixes are okay, but personally don't do much for me, and don't really change the fact that it's still only four songs featured here.Admittedly 'Cold Life' is hard to come by elsewhere, so dedicated fans might want to fork out for this album for completeness sake, but I'd recommend any new or casual fan is better served by seeking out 'Early Trax' instead of this."
4,Interesting more than compelling,"It's a film by Jaglom , Frederick is the lead.Jaglom allows Frederick a lot of leeway and the result isoccasionally exaggerated to artificiality.Believe in directors directing, Jaglom seems to run anensemble a lot of the time and this time the result was patchy.Still worth seeing - not sure if I'd buy it unless you cant get to seeit any other way."
2,Boring inside Hollywood comedy,"Normally, I like Henry Jaglom's brand of films. But this one is so incestuous about what it's like to be desperate in Hollywood that I tuned out for most. The two gay movie producers are somewhat comedic, but the rest, especially the lead actress, are very tiresome. She cries at everything, mostly her own desperation. It's really not that funny. Watch at your own peril."
4,Since you've probably never heard of this album or band. . .,". . . you'll have to take my word for it, they are really great! I had read about Greg Sage and the Wipers before, but this is the only album of theirs I have managed to track down and buy. I hear it's not the best one, but if it's any indication of the band's music, they are easily better than the majority of the grunge bands they unfluenced. The main problem with this is that too many of the songs sound alike, especially during the first half of the disc. But that doesn't mean the songwriting is bad. And Sage's guitar playing (sort of a grungy Tom Verlaine is the best way I can put it--except Sage can sing) is particularly amazing. If you buy this, you'll definitely be impressed by the peek at this chronically underrated (or unknown to be more specific) band."
4,one of America's greatest true underground bands,"Silver Sail is a little different from other Wipers material, to me at least. There's a reflective, more relaxed feel to it that makes for great driving music. There's definitely the influence of the southwest here, in a general way, and the whole idea of extraterrestrials. Highlights for me include ""sign of the times"" and side 2 in general. The title track ""Silver Sail"" just shreds and ends on a sonic blast off to space."
5,Brilliant and beautifully written.Breakthrough. Bravo!,As an art history major and computer enthusiast I am thrilled to see that a work of this caliber has finally been written on this important emerging field. Computers and the arts undoubtedly will be the next milestone in the history of human creativity. After reading this beautifully written text I am convinced more than ever that a revolution is underway in the arts.The author deserves tremendous praise! Bravo.
1,Doesn't work,"The first part of the first episode was very good. I would rate the rest, but after 3 minutes each one stops working, and repeated refreshes and other attempted solutions fail to make it play. Also, I've checked other shows, they all work.My advice for anyone interested in this series: until Amazon can confirm all functionality has been restored, do not buy any episodes."
4,Is this uncensored?,"Nice new draw for Gordon Ramsay. I wonder if it's censored or uncensored. I think that this being labed ""FOX"", I would think it's censored. Can someone tell me this before I buy? Thanks much..."
2,arse,"alright I like Chrome a lot, but this stuff hit the gorgonzola a bit too hard. The lyrics on this are so horrible, ""eat my dust""..... ? It's like they want to be the stereotypical self-pitying wannabe Moressey English that americans seem to have in mind when they hear this stuff. (which we all know is untrue. except for Moressey)"
3,"Something wrong here, but has moments of greatness","This is the Catherine Wheel's least accessible album. It is just too abrasive for the most part. It has some excellent tracks, though: God inside my head, Heal, Eat my dust..., and Judy Staring at the Sun are some of their best, but the rest are rather tough going. I totally agree with the other reviewer who said that most of the tracks sound like bad Smashing Pumpkins; too fast & harsh. But if you're a CW fan, you'll like at least some of this."
4,Change is good,"Catherine Wheel did the lush, dreamy, wall of guitars, ""shoe-gazing"" sound better then anybody. Here, the sound is harder, crisper, heavier, and they do it oh so well. Turn up the volume and the assault is not unlike that of a heavy metal juggernaut. Yet there is still enough of the old beauty in there to keep it satisfying to most fans of the first 2 releases. Adam and Eve, the release to follow, was yet more of a compromise. It also was very nice of the band to pack 12 or more tracks on all of their first 4 releases, with no filler. You will definitely get your moneys worth. Playing all 4 releases back to back can certainly be one heck of a sonic adventure with all the guitar-driven pyrotechnics. Then you can use the Cats and Dogs (B-sides, (not really)) to recover."
3,uncomfortable,"embracing the post-grunge tidal wave, the catherine wheel promised to ""go metal"" since after ""chrome"". while ""chrome"" was an excellent exercise in balancing the noisenik attack of the shoegazers with tight rock structures, ""happy days"" just sounds contrived. still a good record, no doubt, since tracks like ""heal"", ""eat my dust"", ""judy staring at the sun"" save the day. well, the most of it sounds like, well, a bad smashing pumpkins record. ""ferment"" and ""chrome"" still remains archetypes of the catherine wheel sound, to me. thank god they picked it up on ""adam and eve""."
2,Couple of gems,"I bought Happy Days, along with a dozen other CDs, on a trip to Scotland in '96. An Irish friend whose musical tastes I generally shared recommended I seek it out. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with it - it was a bit too alternative/metal for me. But like many of the other reviewers here, I liked 'Heal' well enough, and I still think ""Judy's Staring At The Sun"" is one of the best songs on ANY release from the 90's. In terms of having a perfect mesh of lyrics, melody and song construction, I'd put it right behind ""Losing My Religion"". Not that the two songs share any other similarity other than they are, IMO, just about perfect (funny, I didn't like a whole lot of 'Out of Time' either). Soon as I get around to buying a burner, I'll copy Judy and Heal and then sell Happy Days to my local used CD shop."
5,Powerful,There is no other word to describe this album but powerful. I took this CD everywhere I went; scratched it beyond repair; went out and bought another one. Good stuff.
3,A valuable addition to your Jewish book shelf,"This book provides a valuable service to readers of the Hebrew Bible in that it makes Ibn Ezra's commentary comprehensible even to the non-scholar. The authors have based their work on scholarly interpretations of Ibn Ezra's sometimes telegraphic comments, which are often obscure in their original form. My main reservations concern the format of massive foot-noting, and the use of English transliterations instead of Hebrew in cases where the whole point of the commentary may be a fine distinction in spelling or vocalization of the Hebrew text."
2,This is not about prisons but ok book,"This book had ups and downs. It was very hard to get into at first, that my have been due to my lack of knowledge on horses and the old west. This book however deals with the trust of men and their animals really. As this horse Alcatraz is a horse who had been bread to race escapes his masters home and gets used to freedom. His escape comes at a terrible price though as he becomes known as a murderous beast and Marianne the new ranch owner wants him killed, but Alcatraz is a smart, tough an seems to be a magical horse, able to mystify his hunters that are unable to catch him. Marianne calls in the only man that can catch him Red Jim Perris, and at this point (nearly halfway through the book) is when the story picks up, nothing is straightforward in this book, the scenes with action are written quite well though."
4,Classic,"Was as it should be, an old classic with history & interest. If you like classic writing then you will like this."
3,Wasnt what I thought it be.,"I wasnt crazy about this book. Someone else may like it. I have read some good books, but this wasnt one of them."
5,Just Great!,"Complete and admirable presentation of Ashtanga Yoga foundamentals and the whole first series.More so than the David Swenson book,stays true to the way PK Jois teaches the first series.John Scott is an amazing practitioner and a great teacher in his own right, and that shows clearly in this book.Highly recommended for all Ashtanga practitioners and for beginners that have a teacher."
3,Not suitable for beginners,"This is a really good book. I really mean it. It's obvious that the author's knowledge about yoga is truly wide. Despite this, I find the instructions a little hard to understand and the excercises are a little bit too tough for me. These days I'm having a first contact with yoga and I believe that starting out with a little hatha yoga practise for a couple of months will prepare you for what's inside this book but, I don't think you should try it as your first workout ever. I would give it 5 stars if it the book made a progression from first-time yoguis to advanced practisioners - I think the book fails in this beacuse a little previous knowledge and practise are needing (from my point of view)."
2,Very Difficult to Understand and Execute,I just tried to go through this book and it was a very frustrating experience. I haven't been doing yoga for very long but jesus christ! this book was so difficult. Not only are the postures poorly described but I felt they were for people who have been training for many years. If you are looking for some yoga you can do on your own and you aren't that experienced DO NOT get this book. This book doesn't even take into consideration the fact that NOT EVERYONE IS AS FLEXIBLE AS YOGA MASTERS! Cut beginners some slack John for christ's sake! I can see someone really hurting themselves with this book. Would not recommend this to anyone I know.
1,Really!,"What on earth were the publishers, and the author, thinking about? This book presents ashtanga in such a dull mechanised way, one wonders why anyone ever took the practice up. Full of insipid step-by-step pictures that completely miss the spirit of ashtanga. Who exactly is this book aimed at? There is not enough info for a beginner and there is no 'heart' for the more experienced yogi. The photos are neither artistic nor particularly useful. Shame really, as John Scott was the first westener to draw the visual sequence of the ashtanga primary series in a sort of pictogram form. Why was that not included in the book, and instead we got those awful close ups!If you are looking for a really good ashtanga book that is about the spirit of the practice and is also practical to actually use get David Swensons, 'Ashtanga Yoga'. He designed and published it himself and quite frankly I do not see how anyone can improve on it."
3,Ashtanga Yoga: The Definitive Step-by-Step Guide to Dynamic Yoga,The book has good step by step instructions however the instructions are for advance yogis. A beginner or someone who has been doing yoga for a short time would find it difficult to do the majority of the poses.
3,Light and good for travel...Depth needed,"This is a great book for travel, if you take your practice on the road, as it is small and light...but if you would like a more detailed book, with more than just the primary series and a reference guide (aka a cheat sheet) I would continue to search!"
5,Wonderful Tool for those studying Ashtanga Yoga,"I am currently studying Ashtanga Yoga and this text was assigned to us from our Teacher as ""required"" reading. What a wonderful tool it has been for me. Not only is Ashtanga Yoga made up of complex postures but also alignment of movement and breath. For me, I often forget when to inhale and exhale when entering into and exiting out of postures - this is where this manual has helped me the most. Every posture in this manual has written and photographic instruction including when to inhale and exhale with the movements into and out of posture. Like i said before, wonderful tool :)Om Shanti."
1,Lousy watch,"One month after using, the watch stop functioning. After took it for watch repair, I've been told that the movement is somewhere go wrong and cannot be fixed. This is really a lesson, next time I will choose to buy watch from renowned watch manufacturer, not from those produce apparels."
4,Point of No Return,"It was a sad day in American literature when it was deemed that the big popular novel that explored the plight of the middle class businessman and his family was unworthy any longer of attention. This was Marquand's field, and he reaped a very rich crop from his endeavors. In this, one of his best novels, Charley Gray (an apt name) ponders whether he will get the promotion to Vice President in the bank in which he's employed. He goes back to his home town of Clyde, Maine (Marquand's own Newburyport, MA), for some soul searching. He gets the promotion, but wonders how much of his soul he has to give up for it. Irony is Marquand's main tool in his writing, and he explores his characters' lives with great honesty and insight. One comes away from a novel like this with the feeling that we've come to know the characters as well as we could expect, and their problems and concerns command out attention. Marquand at his best."
4,OK Product,"I have used this product previously for acrylic manufacturing and found the pivot point holes to be very accurate. It is very helpful to use a drill press instead of a hand drill for the holes. Extra pins are almost essential as tool is useless without it. Item is semi-consumable because of softness and thickness of the plastic it is made from, but very good accuracy for my needs.I did receive wrong item from Amazon vendor so I am commenting on an item I bought locally."
2,"Does not support cutouts over 7 1/2"".","In the Technical Details section, it says, ""7- to 18-3/16-inch cutout range and 1 to 7 1/2 inch holes"" I needed to a hole/cutout for a 9"" speaker, so I thought this would work. However the maximum hole/cutout that the 400J can do is 7 1/2"", so it is not useful to me. I give it two stars so you'll read this and not make the same mistake that I did. Look like the 200J may be the correct product for larger holes. NOTE: I'm not an expert and it seems the terms ""hole"" and ""cutout"" are used somewhat interchangeably; additional reading seems to imply that ""hole"" is used when you want to remove material from the inside of the circle and ""cutout"" is used when you want to remove material from the outside of the circle. Either way, the 400J doesn't go beyond 7 1/2 inches."
5,Loved it!!!!,"Every single song on this CD is top-notch! Terri Clark has a strong, gorgeous voice - I could listen to this music for hours and not tire of it! Give her a try. This is, hands down, the best CD I own."
2,"Terri Clark is good, but not my favorite!","This is not her best music. Check out ""Fearless"". I enjoyed a few songs, just ok."
2,"She is a good songwriter, but not my type!","This is not her best music. Check out ""Fearless"". I enjoyed a few songs, just ok."
2,An insult to southerners,"If she's such a proud Canadian, can you tell me where in the world she came up with that accent! No Canadian I've ever heard says ""strang"" for string, and no southerner either! I can't stand her voice or her music. If she wants to sing, she should sing with her own accent and not some overly made up accent that she thinks is what country should sound like"
1,Please avoid; but don't miss the first series,"Jack Chalker's original Well of Souls series (Midnight, Echoes, Quest, Return, Twilight) are classics, possibly the finest science fiction series I have ever read.The three books in this series, this one being the last, are horrid, and I don't just mean in relation to the originals.Like many other writers, his energy was spent after the first few series and books, and he has degenerated into rehashing formaulaic bad prose over and over. Where he used to ""show"" what was happening, he now spends endless pages ""tell""ing in justification of the poor choices his characters make in far fetched plot.The outcome was thoroghly predictable. The plot was the most forced plot I can ever remember reading. The lectures at the end were insufferable.Please avoid. And please read the originals - not to be missed!"
3,Rather Contrived,"or more so than quite a few other situation romances. Rather an easy solution to the problem, requiring a lot of drama-mine."
3,It's ok,"Clever, cute, a decent ending. If you like time travel movies, this isn't it. It was ok, but would love to have seen someone transported to the other time."
5,pleased,"The book of Revelation God's word for the Bibically inept has ben a blessing and soource of instruction for many years. I have ordered several books. I plan a class studying Revevlation and I will use this book. Thank you for making it available to me, Amazon .com.SincerelyCoreta Moody"
5,Outstanding!,"This is one of the BEST books I have ever read, most of the time books usally loose my intrest, but not this one! The Commentary is so simple and easy understand, there are plenty of reference scriptures for confirmation. In my closing let me give this warning about this book. If you read it be prepared for instant (outburst) personal praise & worship right where you are. You can not help be visualize the scenes as they are presented."
1,Premilennial Biased book to steer people astray,"I bought this book thinking it would help in organizing the material contained within the book of Revelation. What I found was an unfounded, biased, futuristic, OPINION that relates the scriptures in Revelation to modern happenings. Where do they come up with this stuff....They should read there Bibles before offering an opinion like this. The Bible was not wriiten to us today...but is applicable to us today! Stop trying to make it seem as if the authors of thie Bible were writing to us!!!!!!! If you want something solid and balanced read Paradise Restored by David Chilton! OR Leon Morris commentary on Revelation."
1,One sided opinion to make people biblically stupid,"I bought this book for amazon thinking it would be different. Thought it would at least be unbaised in it's approach. it turned out to be one of those TBN books. Everything is the middle east, and now things. Who says the symbolic language isn't different. Get some real scholars like Chilton, or J. roddam Williams or Leon Morris, or even Sproul. if you want pre-millenialism GARBAGE buy this book. There are two other views people...better views at that."
1,Really rates a zero,"This book fails to recognize that Revelation is not a prediction of our times, but intead, the Revelation of Jesus Christ was written to a specific Christian community - the Christian community of 100 A.D. in Asia Minor (Turkey).The dispensationalism of this book does a real diservice to the meaning of Revelation. The message of Revelation for all times, is not to worship anything or anybody but God/Jesus. Revelation is not about the end times.If you really want to read some good books on Revelation, read Fiorenza's Revelation: Vision of a Just World or Unveiling Empire:Revelation Then and Now.Reading Revelation for the Biblically Inept really made me sad. Not only does the author interpret Revelation incorrectly, but he doesn't respect the amazing literary style and beauty of the text. What a shame. Leave this book behind."
3,Beware,Some of the reviews of these DVDS are touting them as having been digitally remastered....they have not been remastered. They are viewable and some are worn to the point of being blurry and hard to make out any details. Have always enjoyed JMB as his scripts have usually been top notch. Story lines are good but not great and some are very predictable. If you are a fan of old time Westerns then this might be a welcome addition to your collection but don't expect pristine picture quality...these are old movies that have been transferred to DVD and the picture quality overall is poor. Too bad someone doesn't take the time to remaster these old classics. These prints are from Alpha Video. Am going to order some JMB from VCI as they claim to have remastered theirs. Will keep you informed as soon as I have had the chance to view them.Don Anez
5,The Thrill Isn't Gone,"Eddie is still the maestro. In the age of Regeton, it's still good to hear his classic sound. I'm not sure how a younger generation will relate to this music; but it is still very special to me."
1,One of the worst toys ever,"I bought this for my kid as a christmas present. One car did not work at all when I put the track together, the other died within 48 hours. I ordered 4 other slot cars from Carrera, hoping they would perform better, but it is not the case. They do not stay in their slots in the curves and the looping. The speed control is not fine enough there by prohibiting the user from choosing the right speed to maneuver the curves slow enough to not fly out but fast enough to not fall off. I bought the item because I played with a Carrera race track when I was a child, that was a quality toy, this here is a low quality pice. The cos benefit value is lousy. I cannot recommend it and will not buy another part for it."
2,Difficult to keep on track,"The other reviews are dead on when they say the cars won't stay on track. I can't believe anyone would give this toy 5 stars. Setup takes a couple of hours, and as I've yet been able to make one complete revolution on the track, I can't tell how long it takes to become proficient enough to do so. The manual is poor and offers no help short of setup, which is simply a coulple of diagrammed pictures. I guess with a few more hours of practice, my son and I might be able to make a complete circuit, but sorry; the fun to cost ratio of this toy is abysmal."
1,Unhappy parent,Order cancelled by company 5 days before Christmas. I will not order from this company again. This product was listed on the Amazon website as available when it was ordered.
1,Cars never stay on track,"We tried this out for a few hours. Without the vertical turn this might be a nice set. However, the cars rarely stay on the track even after a lot of adjustment to the brushes under the cars. For older kids, maybe 10+ might be ok but not good for anyone younger."
1,broke the first night,One broke the first night now I have to buy my sister a new pair but it will not be this brand.
4,Hilarious !,Marcus Major is so funny. I laughed throughout the book. While the plot is predictable the dialogue is fresh and witty. I could not put the book down. I would definately recommend this book.
1,Didn't like it.,"I'm sorry but I really hated this book. I didn't care for any of the characters; I didn't care for the plot. I don't understand how Josephine could consider John, a man most worthy, when he made her do something that she really didn't want too. I thought John was a very selfish, arrogant character, and Josephine crazy for wanting him back. I just didn't like this one at all."
5,MAJOR BOOK!!!!!,"THIS IS A GREAT READ. MARCUS MAJOR HAS ONCE AGAIN DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB. THIS MAN JUST KEEPS BLOWING MY MIND. I LOVE THE FACT THAT HIS BOOKS DON'T TELL ON THEMSELVES, YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN...THEN HE THROWS A SPIN ON YA!!! ALLL I CAN SAY IS GET THE BOOK IT'S WORTH EVERY DOLLAR!!! AND TO MR. MAJOR PLEASE DON'T MAKE US WAIT TO LONG FOR ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR MASTERPIECES!!!"
3,"Pages Readers Group Reviews ""A Man Most Worthy""","Pages Readers group enjoyed this heartwarming story about friendship and love. A Man Most Worthy by Marcus Major is a funny, smart novel that details the lives and evolving relationships of old friends and lovers. While we would have liked the author to share more about the transformation that occurred within the main character John Sebastian, we still appreciated the wit with which Majors describes the conversations and emotions between his characters. Majors manages to ""tell it like it is"" with a style that keeps the reader entertained from beginning to end."
4,Definatley A Man Most Worthy,"Josephine was a loyal woman to her husband, until he betrayed her. That left the door open for her ex-boyfriend John Sebastion to restart her heart. This turned around love story will make you laugh, cry and smile. Though it took a minute to get up to the good stuff. This story also gives you a chance of hope."
4,Good shoe for the money,"At first one of the shoes rubbed my ankle, but after they streched out they are a great pair of shoes. Now it is easy to slip on and off without picking up the shoes."
4,A prose experiment that suceeds in providing insight,"At first, I found the uniformly sized (3-page) chunks of invoking with stripped-down sentences in bell hook's Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood somewhat affectless and very structurally arbitrary. Hemingway sprang to mind, but then I thought of Stein's syntax (and the role she claimed in forming Hemingway's style). Hooks's repetitions are more subtle, and perhaps her prose is, too, because eventually I found it compelling. The pain of being different while young and vulnerable came through the chilly prose.What she describes of female complicity in male privilege is particularly frightening and compelling. She experienced little female solidarity, being rejected by her five sisters and never able to please her mother (who agreed with her father that her spirit needed to be broken)."
4,ahhh the memories,"I really enjoyed this book. While some were put of by the simplicity..I welcomed it!It was memories of girlhood, written at times by that little girl who in fact was wise beyond her years. The stories are interesting and a few of them remind me of my own childhood. At times, I felt Ms. Hooks was writing about me :)This is similary to a bio,written in a different but better style."
4,nice game,"Nice game. Great graphics and gameplay and an unusually good sound track for a game.. I just wish I could download the full version and enter in a registration code instead of having to wait for the cd to come. Other than that, runs pretty smooth and plays well. Built-in multi-player networking is a big plus. I give it a 4 1/2 stars and two thumbs up."
4,"Good product, but only received half of it. Bottle leaked!","I usually buy this product at a photographic supply, but decided to order online this time. Apparently, nobody checked to see if the top was screwed on tightly and half the contents leaked out. Oh, well...the supply store isn't THAT far away. Amazon,...are you really sure you want me to review these items?"
1,Ms. Strep is just jealous,I walked in to a book store the other day and they had there 2000 calenders out. One of types was Y2K all Audrey calender. A ture statment of the lasting power of the fairest lady in the history of flim. I did not see any meryal strep posters. This fact alone might be responable to nasty tone which she brought to this work. Also it sould be noted that nither Ms. Hepburn nor her kids had anything to do this the writing of this book.
1,Don't use this seller!,I have emailed twice and now have filed a claim. I have not recieved the book and it has been a few weeks now. Byer beware!
1,buy the book the Hepburn foundation needs the funds,Sean Hepburn Ferrer is suing the author and publisher of this piece of trash for lible.
2,Dark,"It was to dark, couldn't see the picture, and what all that was happening. Never did know what the movie was about, is kane good or evil."
3,Interesting concept-lik,"This was recommended to me by a friend, and I found it interesting, but a bit too video-game-like for my tastes. I doubt that I would buy the full length movie."
1,"Oh, to be 13 again.",Reminds me of the movies that caught my attention when I didn't know anything about acting or writing. If it had good special effects and a lot of action it would look good. But then once you got more than 10 minutes into the film you'd realize the crap you were watching. Now I can do it in 9 minutes.
4,very nice,I am a bit of a skeptic when it comes to ordering on-line. I was pleasently suprised how easy and convenient it was shopping on amazon.com. When I had trouble placing my order I called the 1-800 # and was helped by a very courteous lady from eastern North Dakota. Really enjoy the music on the CD and the price was right too. Unique CD titles that you just can't find in stores. I am a very satisfied customer who plans on doing more business.
1,Don't waste your money!,"My daugther has been bugging me for months now for a camera. I didn't expect a whole lot from this camera but it was even worse than I could have imagined. It should be a crime to sell this thing. Pictures were very blurry, grainy, totally unusable. It won't even work in low light condition or indoors for that matter. But when you take photos outside, the light parts of the photo are totally WHITED OUT.This piece of junk it going back to the store right now. If I could give it less than one star I would!"
1,Wish I would have read the reviews first!,"I had it with 35mm cameras for my daughter. They are just toys and the sadness in her face when the film would get caught inside was not worth it at all. I thought that a digital camera would be the best way to go. She asked for the Barbie digital camera and I thought how bad could it be? WELL! I didn't pay full price which is a good thing but it still amazes me that they put low functional items on the market.If there isn't natural light in the picture, you may as well forget the picture was taken. The quality of the pictures taken outside weren't bad. They were bright. Anything taken in the house was awful.Just about any picture I tried to take in the house received two beeps telling me that I couldn't take the picture!DON'T waste your time and/or money on this camera. I will be looking for a reasonable, ""real"" digital camera (with a flash) for my daughter to take pictures. Even the cheapest 35mm camera has a flash on the camera!"
1,You get what you pay for....,"I bought this for my 5yr old niece when she came to visit me. She was beyond excited. We installed batteries and she walked around taking pictures and loving every moment of it. Then came trying to get the pictures off the camera... the software that came with the camera is awful. I tried installing it on 3 different computers and a laptop and it didn't work on any, and even caused a 'blue screen' on one of them (which is pretty rare with Windows XP in my experience).I've worked with dozens of digital cameras over the years and never experienced any trouble getting the computer to recognize the device. If your are going to spend $35 on a toy digital camera for your child, I recommend spending a few dollars more and getting an inexpensive 'real' digital camera. The look of dissapointment from the child's face is not worth it."
3,"Barbie DC - It is OK for the price paid, but","not user friendly for the kids. The review could have been more informational. This camera is functional, only when there is enough light on the subject and mainly sunlight. Otherwise, the camera does not function. The displays are cryptic and it is hard for the kids to be understand.In nutshell, the kids will loose interest after some try in using this camera and it will be lying in a corner as a show piece."
1,don't waste your $$!,"Omigod! this is the worst product ever! I got it for my birthday and after having it for one day, ONE DAY!, it broke! Please don't waste your money on this! Spend it on something that will last more than 24 hours!"
5,Entertaining album from start to finish. Buy It Now!,"Leave it to a few UK studs to come up with a sound this brilliant. 'Hilarious Euro-pop with slick bass lines' is a fairly accurate description but doesn't do this album justice. The recording is crystal and the beats are easy and fun to follow. ""Got to get a new pair of shoes, to kick it with her, not kick it with you"" is just one example of F&M's delightfully amusing choruses. This is perfect conversation-piece music that will extinguish any drama or awkward silence at your next gathering. Your guests will thank you, and your mp3 player will appreciate your good taste."
3,Only ok,Transparent things is only ok. It's not terrible but it's not amazing. If you like Fujiya & Myiagi you should like this album.
5,F&J are the real deal,"Everything everyone has said about this album is true, and the really good news is that the band has added a live drummer and rocks these songs like you wouldn't believe live. The lyrics may be wack but they are so understated, you can ignore them if you want to and almost think of it as an instrumental album. The band is ridiculously tight. This is actually one of my favorite albums of all time. Funky krautrock is one of the best sounds ever."
4,conquering schizophjrenia,"while i was impressed with the authors knowledge of the history of the developement of medications to treat schizophrenia i would have like more input concerning how his son actually felt about what was happening to him. also, i would have liked to know how his son is doing now."
2,title is a misnomer,"author spends a great deal of time (xxx? pages) oscillating between blaming mental health professionals and presenting himself as a devoted father (perhaps too devoted?--i.e. overly responsible?)...furthermore schizophrenia is not ""conquered"" at the end of the book...rather only the right drug is found--which eliminates symptoms but which, contrary to popular belief, does not ""cure"" mental illness (since the patient is only well as long as he is medicated)"
2,Skip this compilation and wait for the Masterworks.....,"I am scratching my head over this book. There is really nothing visionary about George Perez's work here. Perez really had not developed his distinctive style yet. It is cool to read these 70's FF stories but I would prefer to read all the issues in chronological order without missing an issue or two. Also, the only covers that are included are for issues 184-186. To me it was sort of like reading cover-less comics which I do not enjoy. So, bottom line here is, if you can find it cheap (<10 dollars) it isn't such a bad deal. If you do not mind waiting eventually the Masterwork program will reprint all of this material without the gaps that this compilation has."
3,Nearly Fun,"This collection is a mixed bag of non-consecutive issues 164-167, 170, 176-178, and 184-186 of the original series in the 1970s. Since there are missing issues it's a bit disjointed, but the point is to showcase the Perez artwork. It's not his best work, and often doesn't really look like Perez style that's so distinctive. The stories are nearly fun, sometimes silly, but mostly will appeal for nostagia value. For hardcore Perez fans only. Veering toward disappointing but nearly OK."
3,READ THIS if you buy TV and DVD,"Be Warned: There are 2 different disney TV models: the 1300C and the 1350C. Target sells both (although some stores have one or the other). The 1350C is newer, slightly different design and is &amp;amp;quot;compatible with the DVD player&amp;amp;quot;. The 1300C only has one audio input (white) and not the red one. You can tell from the front. My store's display had the 1300 with the DVD, so we got that originally. 3 days later, we exchanged for the 1350. OF course, the problem with the 1350 is that it does not stack as well as the 1300 (there are divits on top of the DVD for the TV, made to fit the 1300). It comes with a little plastic strap to secure it, but the strap does not reach the TV. So, we put them side by side (safer anyways).I gave this 3 stars as I do not know how the DVD is yet."
4,Piece of Garbage!,"My son got this DVD player as a birthday present this past July (2003) and it had trouble reading some DVD's. As of January of 2004 this piece of junk completely stopped working all together. It will not recognize or read ANY dvd's it just spins them. I have tried cleaning it but it will still not read. I even called Memorex who said that I would have to pay $100 to have it fixed (yeah, right). Anyway, it may look cute but it is completely unreliable and simply does not work. For shame, Disney for lending your name to such a shoddy piece of junk. AVOID!!"
1,disney princess dvd player ...cute product...bad experience,"My daughter received the disney princess tv, dvd player, and clock for her birthday last july. At first everything seemed fine. The product was very cute and the picture quality on the tv was very nice. the dvd player occasionally smelled of very faint melting wire and stopped playing because it could no longer read the dvds. I returned the dvd player to the store that it was purchased at and got a new one. the 2nd dvd player stopped working within 1 month. same smell only this time it shows a picture but no sound. the store does not want to return it and the warranty is up with memorex. my daughter is 3 and she is heart broken. she cried when the player broke and wants a new princess dvd player that works. I am very disappointed also, but I do not want to purchase the same player that will just break again. now she has the whole princess product line but cannot use the dvd player."
1,I cannot believe this,I bought the Disney Classic DVD player and TV for my 3yr old son in March along with 30 dvds and it quit working a month later. So now I am stuck with all these dvds that he cannot watch in his room. It seems like they would do a recall on the product since there has been numerous cases on the product failing.Jennifer C.
5,Excellent DVD to go with our Mickey TV,"I was suprised to read some of the other reviews as we have had ours for 2 years and have had zero problems. It works incredible, easy as can be and I couldn't find a problem with it if I wanted to even with my son banging on it and pressing all the buttons on off, on off, on off....We love it!"
3,nice but won't operate matching tv,"If you like Disney this is really nice and comes with a kid remote too. I got one with the matching TV, Only thing is none of the DVD remotes have controls for the matching TV or any other TV! (volume, ect) You have to go back and forth between two remotes to use it. This was a disapointment thats makes it to hard for the younger kids to use. Extra note: Also if You do get the matching TV, you can't hook up the DVD's right and left audio sound because the matching TV is MONO only, you lose the DVD &quot;experience&quot;. That said, The DVD itself looks funny hooked up to a good stero TV but works very well. The manufacture may want to upgrade the matching TV to take advantage of the DVD features."
1,american hunter remote feeder control,"The unit maybe compatable with some type of feeder control, but not with a good unit like HCR or THE TIMER which in my opinion have far above qualities than my experiences with this remote. It was cheap to buy and that makes it easier to throw away.Eddie from Texas"
4,Will capture your imagination.....,"I read this book in just two days during the busiest time of the year - Christmas Eve and Day! That should tell you how it can capture your imagination. Typically I am not a sci-fi fan, but after reading ""The Mars Transmission"" I'm hooked! Hopefully Mr. Jackson will have a follow-up on further Mars exploration!"
1,Disappointed,"This outfit is supposed to come with a hat and belt but when I received it, those items were missing. It had only the top and skirt in the package which had never been opened. The picture posted on Amazon's website is thus misleading and I still haven't given it to my daughter since she will be disappointed too."
5,"Exquisite writing, original setting","I think this Author describes Aztec society in a more enticing, convincing and plausible manner that Gary Jennings in ""Aztec"", maybe because the protagonist, Yaotl, is not a sexual perverse polymorph, but a humble slave of the First Minister, who finds himself in the subtle intrigues between his master and no one but the Emperor (or, more properly, Tlatoani, Revered Orator) Montezuma. What is notable is the exquisite feeling of impending doom (we are two years before the Spanish conquest)and the fine characterization of the personae of the novel.Omens of what is to come are multiplying, whilst Yaotl tries to solve impossible conundrums fighting for is life! A rare thingindeed, a learned, suspenseful book! Kudos to simon Levack!"
5,VETO PRO PAC XL,"I've only had this bag for two months and so far I can say Im very happy with it. As an electrician for twenty years, I wish I would have found this item sooner. After years of using cheap bags that offer minimal tool organization, this bag is excellent if you appreciate being able to find the tool you need without having to rummage through everything to find it, I also enjoy the fact that with a quick lookover, I know if I have all of my tools before leaving a project. The XL might be slightly larger than I would've needed, but the added space does come in handy. Even with all of my hand tools in place, there is room to toss in a drill, heat gun, etc. on top. The overall construction seems to be very durable. The bag is heavy, but I think its worth the price for something that works very well."
3,Not sure,"Just seems to me this bag is for screwdrivers and chisals, My hammer does not even have a spot in this bag. The inventer was a carpenter so I'm confused. Anyway for $159. I should of bought 3 husky open mouths instead!."
3,"Decent bag, law of diminishing returns applies here..","I have had this closed top bag for years, since Veto came into the market mainstream. It has seen very light use and travel so held up fairly well.Two regrets I have:1) not getting an open top bag, which weren't available from Veto at the time. The closed-top is really inconvenient for my needs and I end up leaving it open all the time for easier access.2) that I spent as much as I did on a simple tool bag.I have never been one to purchase cheap tools and the quality of these bags is unquestionable, but the law of diminishing returns definitely applies here. I would say put your money into something else rather than spend $200 on one of these. I give it three stars for quality materials used in making the bag, but these are very simply put overpriced for what your getting especially when you consider the size of each bag. Very easy to outgrow them"
3,"Love my bag, Hate my zippers.",I have been using this bag in a heavy industrial setting for nearly five years now. It is a fantastic product. The orginization is excpetional I dont even need to look in the bag to pull out exactly the tool I need. Additionally I say hogwash to all those who say there drill and meters don't fit. I have every pocket loaded down with a vast array of hand tools including a 3 lb. sledge a claw hammer a wrecking bar and quick square. Yet I still have room for my Fluke 87 multimeter and my Dewalt 18V driver. My one and only gripe is the zippers. They pretty much ruin the bag both of mine were ruined within 6 months. If you live in an area where weather isnt really an issue then buy this bag. If you live in a rainy place where you actually need to keep your tools covered while transporting them stay away from this bag.
1,Overbuilt for me,"I'd give this bag 5 stars for the fact that it's built like a brick SH, you get mucho durability for your money. But I returned mine. The shipping weight alone should have tripped a circuit in my brain - 8 lbs! This is a heavy bag. If all you do is lug this from the tailgate to the jobsite - say 30 to 50 ft - you'll love it. It'll outlast you. But I work in NYC apartments and haul a lot of what I have to use to the site - and up many stairs. Plus, the design of this bag begs to be loaded with all the tools you have - even the ones you don't need or use anymore. When it arrived, I had an epiphany...I need 3 or 4 bags (lighter bags) loaded with specific tools for specific jobs - take what I need, leave the rest. If it fits your style of work I'm sure you wouldn't be dissatisfied with the Veto bag - but it wasn't for me. I wish the company made a bag that was to a 1/3 the size/weight. I'd keep that one."
2,kinda weak,This is probably the weakest poison idea album and should be avoided. The album is all covers. They don't really add anything great to the origingals. The production quality is lacking as well.
5,"""After the Show""","I think that ""Two Sisters from Boston"" is a great movie because it's funny and romantic. June Allyson brightens up the movie. Especialy in her song ""After The Show"". If you are a June fan you will like her in this early film."
5,dorie,I have never watched this movie before but now that I own it I really enjoyed seeing it. Even though its in black and white the picture quality is very good. Great action and acting by all the actors.
4,A GREAT Album,"If you enjoy Elton John's work of the early to mid 1990's Made In England will keep you smiling. No, it's not Madman Across The Water, but unlike some of Elton's music during the mid 1980's, there's a seriousness to this album that's refreshing. It appears Elton placed some emphasis on making a great album rather than just creating some good singles combined with filler songs.The title track and Lies are fun and rockin' while Man has a tilt towards the gospely type songs E.J. excells with. Please, is catchy pop at it's best and I was disappointed it never bacame a single. It certainly would have been an automatic hit. In other areas, E.J. doesn't quite hit the mark as in the somewhat sappy, Blessed.This was Elton John's best work in years up to that point. In my opinion, it's not the masterpiece of some of his 1970's albums but it ranks up there with his creative and throughly enjoyable albums of late such as Songs From The West Coast and The Captain & The Kid."
1,Over-rated,"Okay okay. So it's not dog awful. But it's close to being. How can you give this 5 stars?, This is nothing compared to the great classic albums like 'Honky Chateau', 'Tumbleweed Connection', 'Goodbye yellow brick road', and 'Captain fantastic'. This is just Adult Contemporary drivel that gets so undeservedly over-rated. If you want something to bore you to tears this is it. Songs from the West Coast was much better, though not as good as the afforementioned."
4,And now for something completely different,"This album was different for Elton, different in the sense that it did not feel like some of his great masterpiece albums from the past. After achieving so much, and losing so much Elton tried to create something to fit his mood during the nineties. Let's face it, if it hadn't been for the lion king Elton wouldn't have had such success as he did in the nineties.I can easily say that this is some of Elton's most intimate and deepest music i have ever run across of his. He takes a very meloncholy approach to pop music and creates beautiful and masterful melodies to fit the lyrics given to him. Every song has a distinct meaning, especially if you notice how it was meticulously produced and arranged. This album is emotional and counters a lot from what he had created in the past. If you're a hardcore rocket man, or a tiny dancer, you may not appriciate this album, but if your somebody that looks for great quality art in music, by all means this is your album"
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO ELTON JOHN??,"""He was an idol then, now he's an idol here. But his face has changed..He's not the same no more..And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before."" (E.John-B.Taupin 1976)"
4,Excellent Pick For His Fans,"Elton John wrote the book on adult orientated soft rock. It was he who first traveled the road followed by Phil Collins, Sting and like minded soft rock mush heads. If you're a fan of the genre, you have doubtless heard him, and this album is as fine as any in his catalogue. Perfect for listening with your lover on quiet summer nights. Especially notable are `Pain', Made In England' and `Latitude'. It's a must have album for his fans."
5,So wonderful and fresh.,"This album was breathtaking. Its songs were very touching and humble. I mean, they just showed another side of Elton John and Bernie. The songs are a spectacular piece of work and Elton and Bernie have done a beatifull job! Its a breath of fresh air, and present such origionality. I mean, the songs just rock! This album (as all others) are for the ages!"
4,As Compared With the LS-82...,"The LS-82 model's battery is rated for a longer battery life than the LS-850's. As compared with the LS-82 model, this one comes with a carrying case, and with the CGR-LH711 battery. This model's battery is a 2250 mAh battery, wheras the battery that comes with the LS-82 model is the CGR-LH712, which is a 4500 mAh battery. If you want a bargain and want the carrying case, then fine go for the LS-850. But buyer's should take note of the differences in battery capacity between this model and the LS-82."
3,"Lightweight, but beatable within brand","This model's lightweight, and the includes extras are nice. But Panasonic makes several models with larger screens and longer batteries, for not much more weight and (at times) a lower price. We bit the 10"" with an 11-hour battery, and have loved it."
2,Safe??,"What concerns me about this video is the intensity with which Karen starts out at and ends with.....she goes from heart pounding cardio, into a dead stop to start the cool down which consists of a few yoga moves and that was it.Is this really safe? I'm used to exercise videos where there's a gradual increase in intensity and a gradual decrease in intensity at the end.Also, some of the footwork was confusing and she doesn't cue well. While this is technically a beginner's workout, I wouldn't recommend it to ANY beginners I know. I consider myself at an intermediate level and just did not like this DVD at all!"
2,Not worth purchasing,"Was extremely excited about getting dvd, especially after reading reviews. However, after it arrived and I tried it out, was very disappointed. It was hard to pick up the moves, and seemed to hurt my joints. I am an avid fitness person, work out 5-6 days per week. This did not impress me."
4,Helpful Study Guide for GRE,"I found the book and CD to be very helpful. I used the CD more than the book to review all the lessons and then the practice tests. The CD looks just like the real GRE test which made it easier for me to feel comfortable when I took the test. CD also contains some great games to learn the vocabulary as well as antonyms, sentence completion & math review. I purchased the book based on the reviews that were on Amazon at that time. I am happy with the book and would recommend it to anyone preparing for the GRE."
1,Mac users beware,"While the book's CD may be ok for PC users, it's a disaster for MAC users. Although the book says the included CD works with the MAC, the included CD is Windows only. There's an 800 number to call for a MAC CD. Don't be fooled. When you dial the number, you'll wind up down an Alice in Wonderland rabitt's hole. After spending an hour calling number after number, the customer service ""professional"" suggested I just mail the book back! Now that's professional customer service at it's best.Get the Princeton Review book. It has a CD that runs on MAC."
3,Ok Book... Does not fully cover the complexities of the GRE,"I was surprised how unprepared I was after 4 months of studing for the GRE with this book. The teaching method is clear, and seems good until you get to the exam. The practice exams were much easier than the actual test and the content covered in the book was not as complex as the content on the test. In particular, the verbal portion of the book does not cover the subtleties in language used in the verbal section of the exam.Barron's book is much better.Overall C+ book."
2,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I loved the Kaplan book and CD-Rom until I started having BIG problems with the CD-Rom. The book has helpful hints and the CD is also incredibly helpful. However, Kaplan's helpfulness becomes severly reduced when you are unlucky enough to become a victim to the CAT error. In my case my first CD-Rom from Kaplan broke two thirds of the way through the math section, forcing me to void all of my hard work and also lose valuable study time. However I called customer service and they gladly sent me out another CD. The big problem came when this CAT error came up as I was using the replacement CD. The tech support guy informed me that all I could do was send back the CD to get a refund. However I would like to know who is going to refund my money for the GRE when I score poorly due to these circumstances. Kaplan is a good product but just be warned that you risk my situation when you use their CD. If I could do it over I would definately purchase another less fallible product."
4,520-730-660 in each section just after two months start!,"This is a very good book. Just a short time after I received the book I got an outstanding mark in each of the three sections. Although the verbal part is still difficult because of the great amount of vocabulary you need, the other two parts were piece of cake after reading Kaplan s GRE. The simulated test are really cool and you can start by one to rate yourself and take the other just at the end of your preparation, to know exactly what progress have you made. Extremely recommended jointly with A GRE Crash Course."
4,A big help!,"Thanks, Kaplan!I bought the book with plenty of time to spare, but didn't wind up seriously studying until within a week of the test. The book got me started early on with the math concepts I needed to review. Then, during the crunch, the CD-ROM was priceless practice with the frantic, clock-ticking real test situation."
2,Take the CD out of the case and play frisbee,"The practice tests on the CD are implied to be adaptive, but when you actually do them, you'll get the same questions in the same order every time. This is not very adaptive to me. Although the CD is full of practice problems, it does little to acutally expose you to how difficult an adaptive exam can be."
4,An excellant goup of tests,"I rate the CD excellent - based on the tests. The tests are extremely difficult (no matter how bright you are the thing will get you down). I definitely see this as a major fault.The test techniques are mediocre - I found the Princeton Review stuff far more useful. Also the Princeton Review book for the verbal section. I wrote after working with Kaplan only (for under a week) and scored 600. I then got a hold of the Princeton books and scored 750. Partly because of more work, and partly because of better technique. The Kaplan tests were central to my success. Needless to say I got into my target school."
4,Good in logic reasoning,"The best part of the Book, not CDROM and other parts, which are so so, is logic reasoning. It explains useful strategies for dealing with logic reasoning, other books seldom do so well."
2,Check Others,"I was working on the book two days before I found two errors in the test questions. In both cases I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out how I missed the question when I finally was able to determine that there was an editorial mistake on both counts. (I'm not finished, so we'll see how many more I can find.....or find me.)This book is fine for GRE study. It will definitely help those preparing for the test. Aside from the editing problems, my primary complaint with with the CD-ROM. It is perhaps the most useful part of the purchase, but the presentation is something that may appeal to high school students.The CD is most useful, so it alone probably justifies the purchase price, but for a study book I would probably look around at some others."
3,"You could find better, but the CD-ROM is great!","I only used this book and the CD-ROM to study for the test. I did not score as high as I expected to. The book itself is worthless; although, the root word list and the math glossary in the back is great. The CD-ROM is the strongpoint of this package. It has practice tests, section length tests, lessons, ect. It explains every question on the tests which is awesome. It also allows you to compare your performance on all elements throughout the use of the CD-ROM. If you buy the book, concentrate on the CD-ROM. I would recommend buying other books along with this."
2,"Be VERY careful, this is for TALL 3 year olds","Two HUGE issues with this:1. Each rear wheel spun in different directions, in other words it would never go anywhere. I was told one of the motors was installed backwards, and that I would have to take it to the repair center 2 1/2 north of my house...yea right tell that to my daughter on her birthday....not that it mattered much (see below):2. My 3 year old daughter is not tall by any means, and is a hair shorter than her friends, but nothing extreme. She did not even come CLOSE to being able to touch the gas pedal. She would have to wait at least 6 months before being able to drive it. She has driven every other type of car her friends have with no issues. I took this back and got a Hummer instead - she is happy and so am I...after all both wheels go in the same direction."
1,Don't disappoint your kids - this car is a lemon.,My son got this car for Christmas (it's now May 31) and he's gotten maybe one month of use out of it. It routinely breaks (battery lasts maybe 2 weeks) and the retailer has referred us to Safety 1st (the manufacturer) to resolve this. Safety 1st has taken an inordinate amount of time to send me parts and is now taking their time to provide me the contact information of someone who might be able to fix the car. It's been a total pain to deal with. My poor son -- this has been a disaster for him. He use to always ask what was wrong with his corvette -- now he just wishes he had a Gator instead. Don't waste your money. Ours was a total lemon.
1,pink corvette a miss for reliability,This care is extremely adorable but after a few times of use it will stop working. It over heats and needs to cool off after only a few minutes. The battery will not hold a charge and it has a recall. Do not buy this product. We were lucky that we had bought an extended warantee from toys r us. They sent us a check with in just a couple of days for a full refund of the car. I have 3 small children who each have there own vehicle. The power wheels brand is the only brand that has not had a mechanical problem. There is a recall on this product.
2,BIG MONEY LITTLE VALUE,I BOUGHT THIS CORVETTE FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD SON FOR CHIRSTMAS 05 AND HE'S USED TWICE BEFORE THE CAR WENT HEYWIRE AND NOW DOES NOT FUNCTION AND SINCE THERE ARE NO SERVICE CENTERS IN HAWAII SO THEY ARE TRYING TO REFUND ME FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE I PAID WHICH ISNT REALLY A BIG HELP SINCE THE ITEAM SELLS FOR $[...]AND UP AND THEY WANT TO GIVE ME $[...]. HOW DO I EXPLAIN TO MY 3YR OLD YOU CANT HAVE A NEW CORVETTE BECAUSE SAFETY 1ST ISNT WILLING TO SHIP ONE TO HAWAII:( I WILL NEVER BUY A SAFETY 1ST RIDE ON CAR AGAIN.
5,Rockin!!,I bought this to replace the one I had several years ago and was lost.cant say enough about a band that never got mainstream but stuck to their guns with the style of metal they do.Love it!!
2,Not the best of books,"I am a HUGE lover of any romance that is set in this time period, especially in Scotland. Yes, the premise of this book sounds intriguing, something new. But I swear, you'll have reached page 100 and STILL nothing has happened. I for one, did not find the hero of this book, heroic. He goes through HORRIBLE torture and he just shrugs it off?Our heroine capitulates back and forth, back and forth ad naseum about ""what to do""! You'll find yourself wanting to scream at the lovely female chieftan ""JUST DO IT ALREADY!""I consider myself more than an avid reader of this genre and this book just didn't do it for me. I will give the author kudos on being able to write exceptionally well scenes and dialoge. She weaves her tale and the feel of the story with an expert pen. However, the story drags in places where it should speed up.If you're into such stories, I suggest Marsha Canham, Virginia Henley and Karen Marie Moning."
2,Disappointing,"An early novel by this author, who has since written much better stories. This book could be reduced by one third and no-one would miss it. It is tediously slow and while the basic plot is a good one, its delivery is disappointing. Readers would have better things to do than to read this book."
1,One of the most boring I've read,"I thoroughly read the first half of book; started skimming from there to 2/3 of book; stopped reading completely. So disappointing......from the title and the ideas set forth at beginning of book, there was an infinate number of stories possible."
5,A great writer...,"Sue-Ellen Welfonder knows how to use words and weave pure magic with her pen. Her novels are well researched and historically acurate, and her plots are refreshing. I have personally loved Knight in my Bed as well as Devil in a Kilt. Medieval Scotland is revived and alive with love and passion with her wonderful characters. I strongly suggest any work by this author and I can barely wait for her next book. She is certainly a keeper! Don't miss her."
1,There HAS to be a better choice.,"It's only good feature is that it fits the camera like a tight glove. But...1. It's not leather, it's black and silver vinyl, and no protective padding.2. There are no extra pockets or room in the case for spare batteries, the USB cable, etc. You could drop a loose xD memory card inside.3. There are no belt loops or a strap on the case. You have to use the narrow strap on the camera. Because of the openings for the strap, the case is not fully enclosed. Keep it out of the rain!I'll take the camera with me to local stores and try to find an enclosed, padded case, with storage space and at least belt loops. I'd looked a bit before I bought this case, but because of the prominent zoom lens most digicam cases are too small."
1,Don't waste your money,"This Fuji case has no padding and no compartments for batteries, spare memory cards, etc.The Lowepro TX200, which is listed as a compact camcorder case, is ideal. It holds the camera snug, has a couple of small pockets, and is a much better value."
1,Poorly written,"This little pamphlet is a real struggle to read--awkward sentences, misspellings, poorly organized paragraph structure. The author provides much advice on making jury rigged repairs on the road. Better advice would be to properly maintain the bagpipe so that it wouldn't fall apart moments before a performance. You will find much better free advice on line."
5,Breathtaking!..,One of Dostoyevsky's masterpieces:Shows all the human feelings in a triangle of love - greed & passion.Absolutely recommended...
5,A Big Production in a Little Package,"I had a hard time getting into the story in the beginning and had to read the first two chapters a couple of times to understand it. It was a little dry and slow moving at first and I had to force myself to continue but it was well worth it when it did take off. I completely lost myself and could not put it down.The Russian social dynamic is not my favorite because of the dry, drab, closed style of relating to one another. But in the end, I guess that human nature is human nature, no matter what the culture and this was a probing window into the life of the gambler and a great depiction of the addictive, enticing nature of gambling. And the writing style ultimately made it an exciting, suspenseful read."
4,A very good though not Fyodor at his best.,"This is a very good book. A brilliant motley set of characters as usual with dostoevsky. Also a very interesting plots and a very memorable hero. I liked Alexei very much, he reminded me a bit of Stendahl's Julean Sorelle. anyway, it shows gambling for all it's shallowness and stupidness but it lacks the religious and philosophical insight of most of dostoevsky's latter work. It's not one of Dostoevsky's best, but what is mediocre for Dostoevsky is still a very very good book in comparison to other writers. I do recommend this book."
1,Disappointing,"Dostoyevski is my favorite author. But this book of his wasn't worth reading. He wrote this book in 2 weeks as he was pressed for money, and unfortunately, it shows. Skip it and read Crime and Punishment or The Brothers Karamazov instead."
5,All new as it say it is.,It's a really good book for those who want to improve their speaking skills and over come it's fears.
4,Unfortunately.. (Not really seller's fault). But a cheap book none the less.,"Unfortunately, I barely used this book (teacher's fault, not seller's) and when going to sell it back, you can only get about $2. But, on the plus side it came in good condition and it was what it said it was, as well as being fairly cheap for a text book."
5,Speach,"It came in great condition, just as advertised. I have been using it for class and I am very happy with it."
5,cool,"good. very good and so good, concise, and also well, theres a lot of info packed in here and the binding is unique."
4,Great,This book came in handy for my public speaking course at school. It was very helpful and I definitely recommend it!
1,The book was used,"The vendor said "" this book is NEW, NEVER OPEN, NEVER USED"", but this book have highlight page, is it New ...the vendor lied to me...sorry but you have to be honest...I paid for NEW BOOK , NOT FOR USED BOOK..... Thanks"
1,horrible shipping times,"I have ordered a simple book, and it has been 9 days already and they still say that it will take about 5 more days. for something that should take only about 3-4 days to ship. This has been a horrible experience for me."
4,Helpful for Student's Majoring in PS.,Really helpful and concise for public speaking students. Keeping it as a reference because I never know when I might have to go back and read some key points.
3,"Archaic language, often stilted prose","Tagore wrote these translations a century ago. The language is often stilted or archaic.However, I sense that these translations may be truer to the original than Robert Bly's. Indeed, reading these helped me to understand that some language that I thought was Kabir's was actually Bly's. For instance, I was always impressed with the line in Bly's translation that refers to a place ""where those who live are not afraid to die.""But in Tagore's translation, that same reference was something to the effect of a place where there is no fear of death. The contrast between the living and the dead was not Kabir's but Bly's.If I could only read one translation I would read Bly's. But why read only one?"
2,Not the Original 1993 Soundtrack,"I was deeply disappointed with this version of the soundtrack. I have the original soundtrack on tape, but I wanted to put it on my ipod so I bought this digital CD. I have to give it a sharp boo. Many of the songs are played completely different. However, the worst thing in my opinion is that the songs on this CD do not have nearly as much dimension and emotion as the original CD. I would say buy the original from someone and load it to your MP3 player manually. Note: if you are looking for something more conventional the newer version might be for you. If you want the music that you listened to over 15 years ago you will probably be disappointed with the new version."
1,Do not buy this CD,"If you are looking for the original movie soundtrack of piano music, this is not it. This is a recording of chamber music. I was dissapointed, played it once, and I doubt it will be played again."
5,A relaxing music.,A relaxing music that can take your mind away from problems and anxieties of everyday life! The perfomance is also excellent! I recommend this product to others.
2,Nothing like the movie.,"You would think that a CD about the film The Piano would feature, (dare I suggest it!)um, piano music but instead, this CD featured some wierd chamber music that really should stay there--in a chamber. Discordant, directionless and eerie, I was very dissapointed. The film was terrific but the CD was not."
3,The Piano Soundtrack,"In the movie the music fit perfectly. In the soundtrack, much of it is jarring to my senses. The two songs I like the best are worth the price of admission, however, and bring tears to my eyes.Janice Lawson - Montana"
5,"Unique,cute TV and DVD","I really love my purchase. Target was so nice to have gotten the last one in stock for me. I bought it for my 16month, he over-powered the large TV mom and dad watch, so we had to buy this cute mickey mouse TV and DVD. He loves it so much. It's got so many advantages and extras on it. I can program sleep mode, when I forget to turn it off. Now we can watch our big TV and he can watch his mickey TV and DVDs FINDING NEMO and ONE FINE DAY over and over and over again! Target is the best store!!"
3,READ IF you will buy both TV and DVD,"Be Warned: There are 2 different disney TV models: the 1300C and the 1350C. Target sells both (although some stores have one or the other). The 1350C is newer, slightly different design and is &amp;quot;compatible with the DVD player&amp;quot;. The 1300C only has one audio input (white) and not the red one. You can tell from the front. My store's display had the 1300 with the DVD, so we got it. Few days later, we had to exchange for the 1350. OF course, the problem with the 1350 is that it does not stack as well as the 1300 (there are divits on top of the DVD for the TV). It comes with a little plastic strap to secure it, but the strap does not reach the TV. !! So, we put them side by side (safer anyways).Otherwise, my 3yr old loves this, he finds the remotes easy to use. The 1350 differs from the 1300 in that the TV shell is a little slimmer, the speakers are much slimmer, comes in a mickey box (1300 is donald) and the remote is different too.Good luck!"
3,Missed Opportunity,"This should have been awesome. You cannot get Roger's first 3 Smash albums on CD and they are by far the best of his career. They even call them classics in the booklet yet they incliude less than half of the songs from those CDs on this Box Set. Where is ""Got 2 Again"", and ""That's Why I love You Like I Do""????? Why they did not include all the songs from his first 3 classic CDs is beyond me. Shame, shame, shane...."
5,Roger Miller - King of the Road - 3 CDs,"I had the CD of Roger Millers ""Super Hits"" but it only had 10 of his songs. I looked for a more complete set of his songs and found this 3 CD set ""King of the Road: The Genius of Roger Miller."" It has 70 songs of all different styles.I have enjoyed it very much. The CD Set came with a Booklet which is a biography of Roger's music career with many picturesI highly recommend this CD set to any Roger Miller Fan."
3,Should Have Been Great - Missed Opportunity,"Everyone knows that Roger's best work by far was on his first 3 Smash albums which are all classics. It is unforgivable that they would not include all of those songs here. Where is ""Got 2 Again"" or ""That's Why I Love You Like I Do""??? There is more than enough room to include all of the songs from those first 3 albums (they were very short!) They sure screwed this one up! SHAME!! Roger deserves much better!"
3,The message is dangerous,Have some good advice. But the message that image is everything and content is secondary is somewhat troubling to me. The author never mentioned it is important to present the listener useful information.Madoff had a lot of perceived confidence and perceived trustworthiness.
4,Speaking Your Way to the Top: Making Powerful Business Presentations (Part of the Essence of Public Speaking Series),"Easy to Read, Easy to Follow"
5,Works nicely,"I put this in my SUV as a backup camera monitor. Allows me to see what's behind me in parking lots, or when backing into the garage.I mounted another camera on the back of our 25' travel trailer. This monitor has dual inputs. By selecting the second input, the view behind the trailer is displayed. This avoids blind spots while towing, and makes backing the trailer into a campsite simple.The included amount of cables and adapters was impressive. This really is a complete kit. It has survived the hot temperatures inside the SUV here in FL, and has operated for many hours at a time (on 100% while towing).No complaints."
4,Hazelnit pods,Have been buying them for well over a year. My husband enjoys flavored coffee and I do not...this is a simple solution ...he has his flavored coffee and I don't have to make a full pot and throw away the remainder...I am able to make him a cup at a time using this product...I have also bought them for my daughter-in-law and she was most appreciative....she makes a cup for herself before she leaves for work...my son does not enjoy flavored coffee (he is a green tea drinker) so this works well for them ...have had trouble buying Hazelnut pods in the stores so I order them for my daughter- in-law as well as for myself...
2,Very pretty book--but were the recipes tested???,"I was so excited to get this book--I love to bake and love making homemade brownies. When the book arrived 2 weeks ago, I was not disappointed. Great sounding recipes, very pretty book. I believe I have pasted about 50 sticky-note tabs to the pages of the brownies I wanted to try.So why two stars? Well, I've now made 4 different batches of brownies, and not one has turned out. The biggest problem seems to be baking time--upwards of 20-25 minutes off the time stated in the book to get them past pure ""goo"" stage. That would be fine if they turned out ok in the end, but that was not the case. With the extended baking time, the perimeter of the brownies (at least 2 inches in) curled up and was very overbaked before the centers were anywhere close to being ready. I salvaged what I could.I will use this book for ideas about flavor combinations, but I'll stick with my Cook's Illustrated brownie recipe since it works."
1,Very disappointing!,"I love brownies and was very excited to find this cookboook. I make brownies all of the time, and I make different types, but I'm always looking for new kinds. I tried 2 of the recipes and both turned out awful! The recipes seem to have too little chocolate, too little butter, too many eggs and very long baking times. I wasted some really good chocolate testing these recipes! After reading a few more of the recipes, I just decided to throw it out!"
2,"Buy ""Brownie Points"" instead","I searched three different bookstores on my last day in the US, so desperate was I to have this book. Just when I was about to give up, I was able to procure the last copy that they had at Barnes & Noble.I read this on the 15 hour flight back home, and I must say that I prefer Lisa Slater's <U>Brownie Points</U>. While Brownies to Die For! has a more captivating title, and is hardbound, I'm a little wary of the photos, which I feel are very amateur for a published book, especially one by a food writer and recipe developer. Reading the past customers' reviews about wayward recipe cooking times only increases my trepidation of whether this book was worth my fervent search for it. Save yourself the grief and buy Brownie Points instead."
3,Purple Cover vs. Brown Cover,"I have been using this book since I began teaching design and the design process 16 years ago and LOVE IT! BUT, for some reason this version has removed a number of very helpful images and drawings. SO, I recommend ONLY the original Brown cover or the NEW UPDATED CLASSIC in BROWN cover."
1,I hear it's horrible! I have better!,"I hear this kit is pretty bad.I used to collect spy toys (the company is Spy Gear). I had a bunch of secret listeners. It had removable ear buds. I have like 2 I belive. They work great in my DS! My friend tried the same thing only some other stuff wich was her Fly Pentop earbuds and her Scooby Doo Radio earbuds and they work great too! About the DS cases I have a Nintendogs case and it was Nintendo certified and it is awsome! Now those game cases. My friend has 4 game cases and they looked cool so then I went throught my house looking for somthing to use and I found a Barbie suitcase (since I have a million Barbie things) and it works great! It can hold 2 GBA games, 3 DS games or 1 GBA game and 2 DS game! I hear the Car Adapter works SO GET IT SEPARATE!! I hope this helped!"
5,GREAT Kit!,"This kit has everything for the DS! Sweet case loaded with cool stuff for the DS, like the must-have car charger!"
2,The Guide to Graduate Environmental Programs,"I was disappointed in the scope of the book and its contents. The information was thin and I felt that I got just as much if not more info from the web or annual graduate guides. Additionally, the information included didn't provide the ""in-depth"" information it advertised. The most pressing problem is that much of the information is out of date. Tuition has increased, other schools are in the running, programs are changing, and contacts have changed. The book is fine for someone who doesn't have access to the internet or a bookstore, but I would recommend waiting until a new edition comes out before buying it."
5,Rock and Roll,It's wonderul that we can get the music of yesterday as it brings back so many memories. Thank you for having a large selection.
1,obsolete and overpriced,This model is at least one generation out of date. Do not pay $2000 for a $500 camera. NewerNikons are available for less.
1,WATCH OUT WRONG KNIFE,The knife in the picture is a hobbytech knife also sold by the same company for 49.95. Even though it clearly says puma sportec knife is what I bought they sent me a hobbytec knife. I needed it for a present and was extremely dissapointed that this company has false advertisement and also does not give you a tracking number our a reciept in the box. The knife was wrapped in newspaper. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL COMPANY. Look at the picture it is not a sportec knife dont go by the title because you will be sent a hobbytechPuma Hobbytec Clip Point Lockback KnifeITS THE SAME PICTURE!!!
3,good stuff,"I try to listen to respectible and well done music. However, I set my standards for music aside when I listen to Trance. The music is so dramatic and accesible it's impossible to not sit back and just enjoy it. I started playing techno and dance music on my iPod while I skated some months ago and I've found that trance is the best for skating music. I'm really tempted to make a skatevideo using this stuff.If you want to enjoy a fun record with a bunch of sings that hit the mark just right and some that sadly miss then get this one."
3,"Not too bad, not too good either.","I've been enjoying trance for a few years now and typically like anything Van Dyk shows up on but this album is mediocure. Given a chance to sample 30 seconds of each track apparently wasn't enough to to know the entirety of it. I took a chance and, while not horribly disappointed, I wasn't screamingly impressed either."
1,Rushed & Poor,"You know that this is a rushed slacking off LP job when the index on page 4-5 with the map of places to visit still shows names of places with placeholders. For example, it would say ""see Victoria (pp XXX)"", etc. Suprisingly, newer editions do not have this print error.Avoid this book. Its just not researched enough.Cheers."
4,Best BC guide I found!,"After combing 3 other travel guides before my trip, I realized that my Lonely Planet guide had it all. Where other guides miss the mark, Lonely Planet nails it. Everything in Fodor's, Off The Beaten Path and some other one I can't recall was in the Lonely Planet guide. As well, Lonely Planet honestly tells you the truth about why ""this"" is a winner and ""that"" is a loser. Information was up to date and accurate and most importantly opinionated and honest! Had a fantastic vacation!"
5,Superb Singer,"It's amazing that since 1998 when this CD was released by Lumiar, nobody has rated this awesome CD by Brazilian singer Carol Saboya; her first CD full of great vocals and a solid Brazilian Jazz base with extremely great musicians:- Carol Saboya / Vocals- Antonio Adolfo (Carol's Dad) / Piano and Arrangements- Adriano Giffoni / Bass- Pascoal Meirelles (from Cama de Gato) / Drums- Zeca Assumpcao / Acoustic Bass- Jurim Moreira / Drums- Sivuca (the Great) / Accordion- Jorge Helder / Bass- Dirceu Leite / Woodwinds- Claudio Jorge / Acoustic Guitarand many more...A must have CD if you collect Brazilian Jazz, and Brazilian vocalists; it's a great treat."
5,forgotten favourites,"when i played these tracks on my radio program, i got the biggest audience response in years. more than 20 calls asking where to buy the album. when they talk about pop/soul music, this is up there with the very best. melba moore, ashford & simpson on backing vocals just adds to the quality. check out 'dancing mood'."
3,"Apples, Peaches., Pumpkin Pie",Gald I found it as a gift for friends that suddenlt recalled it from long ago.
4,Wow! What a plot!,"Gripping, satisfying mystery. A one-of-a-kind plot. Couldn't put it down. Heartily recommend this one."
4,A great Read,"Although it was slightly overdrawn - far fetched, at times, I found myself caought up in it and really enjoyed the book. A good summer read! Perhaps toomuch of a women's story, however, I wondered if my husband would enjoy it as much as I did."
4,A propulsive page-turner with believable characterizations.,"I loved this book. The souls of the main characters rang true for me, an idealistic ex-VISTA myself who transplanted to a rural area. The horror of the story and the brilliance of the courtroom drama more than compensate for the shortcomings mentioned in the reviews. A successful cross between Marge Piercy and John Grisham."
2,interesting but tendentious novel/mystery,"This novel did best with the witty dialogue and the fast sweep of the plotline. What I found most irritating were the small narcicisstic tics. How many times did we have to be told that our two strong, brave Jewish heroines had strong, brave Jewish (dark and curly) hair, just like the author's picture in the book jacket? Still, these two characters were quite interesting; the characters from the town itself were drawn as stick-figure foils The final denoument seemed ridiculous."
2,Overly ambitious,"This could have been a great beach read if Korelitz hadn't been so intent on making it Deep and Literary. Its strengths include an inherently compelling plot, dialogue that crackles, and some terrific (if far-fetched) courtroom scenes. However, this book boasts not one likeable character. Not one! Its biggest flaw, though, is that Korelitz loads it down with so many themes -- being a mother, being a friend, being an outsider, being a woman, being a Jew, etc. etc. etc. -- that the entire thing creaks and eventually collapses under its own weight. The ending is beyond ludicrous. Korelitz is obviously a gifted writer; here's hoping that next time she plays to her strengths and avoids the thematic overkill that marred this book so badly."
5,"""The Sabbathday River""","This book was absolutely wonderful!! The way I rate a great read is whether I can't wait to finish it, or whether I don't want to give it up. This one, I didn't want to give up!! I was lost in Naomi's Goddard, I think because I have lived in a similar situation for the last 8 yrs. Naomi was a strong, determined woman, even when she didn't know it! And the ending,,whoa!! What a surprise, I didn't see it coming at all. Thank you, Jean Hanff Korelitz, you are an outstanding novelist.korelitz"
2,much ado over nothing,"I tried to like this novel. The author can put together words with a nice touch, but the characters are all over-wrought and just plain stupid. They never speak up and say what they think, but instead, moan inwardly. The plot revolves around a dead baby and the young woman who is accused of being her mother and killing her. The woman says the dead baby is not hers. The DA says otherwise. Does he ever bother to do a simple test of any sort - blood test, DNA etc? No! They whine and moan for pages instead. In saddens me to think this is what critics call great literature."
4,very tight right above knees,"I am a size 30 in jeans so I thought it would be fine if I ordered a size 32. I had seen other posts recommending that. I got a size 32 and everything fit nicely except for the part above the knees. It felt really tight, like if was going to cut off blood flow. I am super fit, swimmer build but I guess my thighs are above average thickness.I've ordered a size 34 and am waiting for it to arrive to compare.PLEASE NOTE: You might have to order 1 to 2 sizes bigger depending on the thickness of your legs.Otherwise, they seem to be a great product. I still haven't tried them out in the pool as I am waiting for the 34's to arrive and see which size I keep. They look super cool though!"
3,Got what I expected,"I agree though with other who have commented on the size running small. However, I'm afraid if I had ordered the next size up it may have been too big. Hard to know."
5,Excellent suit,"The best jammer I've owned. Very well made, comfortable, flexible (fabric stretches well), stunning blue color. The best fitting 34 of the four jammers I have (at waist and above knees), even of the ones made also by Speedo."
3,Are the Speedo jammer sizes standard?,"I have a 36"" waist but for several years have bought Dolphin 38"" jammers. The 38"" Quantums I just bought are too tight. Anybody have any experiences with this? I called Speedo but didn't get an answer.In this order were also Speedo GCG goggles and the strap broke right out of the box. I usually buy TYR and they last a very long time.I paid more for Speedo but I am frustrated.???"
3,Navy/Gold,The fit and comfort of the product is very good. The color fade was more than I thought it should be in a short period of time.
5,Nice pair of jammers,"This jammer fit me me perfectly. I've only had it for a couple of weeks and have used it twice, but it seems to be holding up pretty good so far. The white stripes are translucent, but they are along the side of the leg, so its not really a factor to me. I'm 6'3"" and 210, with large legs, and I did not find the legs to be excessively tight. I've been using them for pool use only, so I guess time will tell on how durably they hold up to the chlorine."
4,a bit snug,"This is great, but it is a little tight right above the knees. I would suggest if you have larger legs, to get a size higher than what you think it should be."
1,Do not waste your money. White dots on screen.,"Do not waste your money on Samsung DLP TV's. Mine now has bright white dots all over the screen and looks very bad. Google it first, you will find that everyone has this proble after a couple of years."
1,Be ready to replace bulbs :(,"I've had this TV for two years and had to replace the bulb twice @ $200.00 a pop. Hope you have a $200.00 per year operating budget to work with - other than that, its a great TV. P.S. no I don't watch TV 24/7....this thing just eats the bulbs and they are expensive."
2,So & So but get ready to buy a bulb every year.,"Had this set since 12/2006. Since then I am now on my FOURTH bulb at $200 a pop! TV is not turned on 24/7 but still eats bulbs like candy. Nice looking TV, picture quality is okay, sound quality is poor and requires external speakers / surround sound. No one including Samsung can explain why bulb needs to be replaced every 8-10 months. Total invested in bulbs to date . . $800!"
1,DON'T BUY SAMSUNG DLP TV SETS,"Purchased a Samsung DLP model # HL S4676S only 2 1/2 years ago. All was well until a small bright white spot appeard 2 weeks ago. Now there are over 30 spots on the screen. I did some research and found this to be a common problem. Samsung offers only a 1 year warranty and refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem with their DLP sets. There are numerous on-line discussions regarding this issue. To do the right thing, and keep their credibility, they should recall these and replace them. The repair bill for this seems to run between $500.00-$900.00, which is a lot to have to spend on a 2 year old product. Stay away from them!"
1,terrible picture with DVDs,"I bought this TV last December and hooked up an HDMI DVD player to it. I have only seen the picture on DVDs, and I do not use it to watch broadcast television. The DVD picture is just awful. The pixels are so big that it's distracting.The TV was thin and light and easy to place where I wanted it, and the sound is good, but I'm very disappointed in the picture quality.December 2011 Update:White spots started appearing on the screen about a year ago, a few at first and then finally hundreds. Then the picture went out altogether. I didn't bother getting it fixed since it was never a good TV to begin with."
4,Undiscovered rock/country gem,"Kim Richey is one of those country artists that country radio has not embraced. Her first CD was acclaimed more by the rock press than anyone. Richey reminds me a little of early Emmylou Harris and if FM radio existed today as it did in the 70's, Richey would probably receive airplay as Harris did. Richey is also reminiscent of Shawn Colvin on the first CD. Every song has great hooks and the whole CD is just an absolute pleasure. When listening, try ""Those Words We Said"" (tr#1), ""Here I Go Again"" (tr#2), ""Just My Luck"" (tr#9), and ""Good"" (tr#13)."
2,Ummm . . .,"This is not a good album. If, like me, you decide to go back because you love ""Rise"" ... don't go this far back."
2,Video playback was bad,It was choppy and didn't playback very well at all. I haven't had this problem before maybe something needs to be adjusted on my computer but i am not sure.
1,Don't bother with Season 3,"Seasons 1 and 2 are way better than this piece of trash. They introduce Teresa's hothead, chauvinistic prick of a brother and his painfully oblivious and bitchy wife. I stopped watching after one episode. I'm glad they managed to have two good seasons before introducing Melissa and Kathy (+ families)."
4,Too much mediocrity around the great grooves,"The J.B.'sFunky good time: The Anthology (2 CD set)This is an enjoyable set that has a few great cuts but there is just too much in it that sounds like they are keeping the groove going in anticipation for the song to begin...and it never does.If you want to hear the original J.B.'s playing their best, you have to get James Brown's ""Love Power Peace: Live at the Olympia, Paris, 1971"" CD.Funky good time: Anthology is an adequate but unspectacular overview of the J.B.'s. As such, it gets a Four Star rating.Love Power Peace: Live at the Olympia, Paris 1971"
3,Funky Good,"Being a big fan of James Brown I decided to purchase this two cd set. The first cd is awesome,real nice funk!! The second cd is okay. If you are a big James Brown fan or you just like funk,you might like this album."
4,funky good time,"If you enjoy James Brown's horn work this anthology of the JB Horns will be very much appreciated. It shows the band in a broader spectrum than just funk, including R&B;, soul, and more jazzy pieces. For me it was worth it just for the instrumental version of Soul Power '74. Hilights are The Grunt, Pass the Peas, Givin Up Food for Funk, and Breakin Bread.Great grooves. Inclueds tunes by Fred Wesley and JB Horns, Maceo and the Macks, the JBs and the New JBs!!!"
5,A great night light for our small bathroom!,"Not real bright, but just fine for a small bathroom nightlight. Great price and my wife likes the way it looks."
2,"Dull, and not the same as a bulb","NOT white, more blue.MUCH less light than an average X-mas bulb, & don't replace the brighter ones like night lights or the one in the dryer.The night lights will be too dark.Wait until they get LCD bulbs better."
1,Buyer beware.,"This bulb is not even close to the brightness level of a standard C7 night light bulb. Also the bulb ""flickers"" constantly, instead of being steadly on which drives me crazy. I took a gamble in the hopes that this would be a good bulb but no such luck. I really wish the LED light revolution would happen already."
2,Strobelight,"I have been looking for an LED bulb for a light-sensing nightlight. This, like other LED bulbs I have tried, strobes: turns completely on and off about twice a second. I have finally decided that none of the available LED light bulbs will work in this light-sensing nightlight without such strobing, based on reviews on Amazon and personal experience.I am keeping this bulb for another nightlight which does not have a light sensor. In that nightlight, it appears about half as bright as a standard incandescent nightlight bulb, and the light is quite a bit bluer than the warmer light provided by an incandescent bulb. The diamond pattern on the outside does a fairly good job of diffusing the LED light."
2,"It uses little power, but it's not very bright","I bought this light bulb to replace a 7W C7-size incandescent light bulb. This bulb my be okay for uncovered nightlights, but it's really quite dim in the covered nightlight I'm using. The item description doesn't mention a light output level (i.e., no mention of lumen output), but it's considerably dimmer than the 7w traditional incandescent it was meant to replace. As a result, I'm having to buy a new incandescent as a replacement instead."
4,"Calvin and Hobbes, eat your hearts out.","I bought the dubbed version of this tape only because I thought it might suck as a subtitled. Surprise, surprise, this was one of the best dubbed tapes I've watched. Then I checked out a subbed and that one was pretty good too. Even though the animation designs for the humans suck, the monsters are pretty well thought out and look believable. If this series ever comes out as a DVD set I'm jumping straight on it...."
5,A very awesome anime!,This is probably one of the funniest animes I have ever seen. There is not much I have to say about it but I suggest it to anyone who needs something to watch.
4,TV OR NOT TV,"This early novel by Patterson is far inferior to his later works, but I think it stands on its own in kind of a predatory or sadistic way. The whole concept of hostages being negotiated and aired as a t.v. special is all too frighteningly real, considering the nation's obsession with so-called reality television. But the premise is intriguing, and the story has some tense and riveting scenes. My main complaint is that within the novel, John Damone tells Stacy that ""the man I hired killed him. Lord just brought it up again.."" So i figured Stacy was in on it, but obviously she wasn't. This little confusing issue kind of squelched my overall enthusiasm for the novel, but even then Patterson was writing awesomely, giving us a glimpse of what he's come to do best---trial novels!RECOMMENDED."
4,stick with it,When I first starting reading this book I honestly couldn't tell what was what. But I kept at it and it really paid off! I have never read Patterson before but I can tell you I plan to read a lot more of his work! Even though I figured out the ending pretty much as soon as the hostage was taken it was still fun for me to read.
3,Part of this book is great,"This is the fourth book by this author I have read. For awhile I thought it would be the best one--I was hugely enthralled by his Degree of Guilt. A presidential candidate is assassinated in California, reminding one of Bobby Kennedy--and Tony Lord, ace lawywer, defends the shooter, claiming insanity. The shooter had been in Vietnam and there is a vivid account of his time there. The trial occupies more than half of the book and it is super-exciting reading. Thereafter the scenario becomes less credible with a terrorist called Phoenix taking hostages and broadcasting nationwide on a CNN-like network and it all gets pretty wild and therefore less exciting. And it does not help that Lord's morals deteriorate. So what I thought might be a five=star book is less than that, but there are great stretches of tense reading in the book."
3,Richard North Patterson could have done much better,"Richard North Patterson's ""Private Screening"". This novel is not among the best of Patterson's list of thriller novels. The story line is just ""okay"". There is major drag in between chapters and the storyline. It seems Patterson got lost in weaving stories together - a Presidential candidate gets shot - a signer's (presidential candidate's girlfriend) manager and a newspaper baron's wife are kidnapped. The kidnapper demands ransom. The criminal attorney who defended the killer who killed the presidential candidate gets involved in the kidnapping scheme (on the good side) and then the chase begins to nowhere...Well, there is a twist when the identity of the kidnapper is revealed...but the reader can guess the identity of the kidnapper by well, just guessing! But yes, there is an anti-climax which doesn't provide the necessary jolt.In the end I was eager to loose this book and move to John Grisham's ""The Partner""!"
4,"One of Patterson's first books, it's impossible to put down!","This was the third book I've read by Patterson, and each one twists and turns until the last page. Although he layers flashbacks throughout, there are times the reader may feel lost. In his subsequent books, Patterson more clearly weaves the multiple layers of his exquisite plots. He is definitely the thinking-reader's hero! The stories read fast and furious to their unexpected conclusions!"
1,Awful book,This is the first book by Richard North Patterson that I've bought and I must say I'm never going to buy another written by him again. This book has too many deep English words that ordinary people don't even use.
1,NOT REVIEWED AND NOT SHARED,I never received this book from the used book dealer so I can't rate it or write a review of it.Please remove it from my sharedpurchases. Thank you.
5,"Many, many, many wonderful ideas","A dear friend recommended this book to me. At first, I couldn't get into it then I was so absorbed by it that I couldn't put it down, I was taking it every where with me just to read a page at a time. The theme is so simple and so important - love yourself - turn away from self-condemnation, sorrow, resentment - and love yourself. Then, seek a partnership with God, seek/accept loving, encouraging support to be a wonderful, generous person that wants to grow and help others grow (in the way that is best for them). I have so enjoyed this book, so enjoyed sharing it with others. My favorite response is when people see the title - Many Wonderful Things and say it must be a book about dancing or flowers or my girlfriend - whatever people interpret as Many Wonderful Things."
5,Best ever snack giveaway,"We gave away the Biscoff cookies (1 packet each) and a mock airline boarding pass to 300 women at a convention after a brief skit about an airline trip to a Gala.I have never in my life seen ao many adult women so happy to recevie these cookies! They were like kids, some asking for two and three packets! It seemed that they were very familiar with this product and some commented that they are sorry that they no longer receive them as a snack on the real airlines."
4,Intriguing glimpse into the everyday misery of 1930s Russia,"Fitzpatrick has produced an intriguing book about the miseries of everyday life in Stalin's Russia during the 1930s, when people had to struggle with a world which had been turned upside down by both the revolution and the turmoil of the collectivisation and industrialisation policies of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Using a wealth of sources, she shows with particular clarity the great incompetence of the bureaucracy, where everyone seemed more interested in fighting for influence than in serving the people. She also puts the focus on crime, hooliganism and how the lot of women was slowly improved through the chance to get a decent education. Fitzpatrick also does not disappoint with the crushing effect of the nightmare years of 1936-1938, when millions were executed or imprisoned during the Great Purge. A vital read for all those fascinated by the topic of Stalinism"
4,An excellent study,"This is very close to a pure study and report on the political makeup and civil society of post Lenin USSR. It presents facts culled from the people themselves, corroborates personal experiences with the massive library of correspondence built by the the CPSU. It does a good job of not judging or praising political methods and instead lets the reader make the conclusion. This document should not be used to condemn or enshrine Stalin and serves as a dialectical collection of facts. I enjoyed it immensely! Highly recommended for history students, students of socialism and it's real world implementations."
4,Very well researched!,"Fitzpatrick's scholarship is impressive: a cursory glance at the bibliography reveals her familiarity with Russian and English literature on her subject. In two hundred or so pages, she crams a lot of valuable info about everyday life in the society Stalin ravaged for decades. The result is a scathing disgust for the monster who ruled the country and pity for the citizens who lived and died under his thumb."
4,"Okay, but not the best.","I give it four stars for Layla, Cocaine, I Shot the Sheriff, and White Room. Overall an okay album to own."
4,"Almost there, but should have been 2 disks","Come on - how can anyone try to capture the career and range of Eric Clapton on a single CD? It just cannot be done. But for a single-disk set, trying to keep the price down, it is a pretty good collection.As for some comments in other reviews - how can you hate Dire Straits? Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton are both superb guitarists - I hope I'm not waiting in vain for the two of them to collaborate on an entire album! If you've ever seem them work together, it is truly an amazing performance. Mark Knopfler/Dire Straits is a must-listen, same as anything by Clapton.I can rattle off several songs that should have been included -Can't Find My Way HomeTales of Brave UlyssesBad LoveMotherless ChildrenThe Shape You're InBut the album is what it is - maybe sometime soon we'll get an even more comprehensive collection, but until then...this one IS pretty darn good."
4,"Great early ""Clapton"" collection.","For the casual ""Eric Clapton"" fan, this is the best place to get most of his early hits. A number of these tracks are even from his time with ""Cream"", ""Derek And The Dominoes"", and ""Blind Faith"". Every track is great, but my favorites ones are ""Sunshine Of Your Love"", ""After Midnight"", ""Layla"", and of course ""Cocaine"". The only thing I miss is ""Can't Find My Way Home"". But at 19 tracks it's hard to complain, so it should be all the early ""Clapton"" you could want. If you're looking for his later stuff like ""Pretending"" and ""Tears In Heaven"", that's on ""The Clapton Chronicles""."
5,His Best Collection of Studio Hits,"If you're looking for a brief yet thorough compilation of Clapton's hits from Cream to the early '80s, then this is the one. This CD probably gets the most playing time of all the CDs I own (over 100). It would be great if they could fit more material on, especially from the Yardbirds, but with a career as expansive and varied as Clapton's, it's an impossible task. Anyone who calls themself a guitar or rock fan should own this album. As far as looking into the true greatness of EC, you should DEFINITELY check out his live stuff. The box set ""Crossroads 2"" is a must-have for any Clapton fan. Listening to ""Slowhand"" perform live, letting his inhibitions fly, is a uniquely powerful experience."
3,Something for everyone I guess,"Clapton has had an erratic carrer. He has been in the top and completely lost musically, and this album shows some of that. Unfortunately, some of his best moments are not included here, the yardbirds and the bluesbreakers and the 90's unplugged. For the pop fans, some tracks may sound too full of guitar and viceversa. I can only imagine the hardcore Clapton fan to be fully happy with this album, since the styles vary so much. I mean, some tracks hardly have a guitar solo, and this is one of the greatest axe men ever!"
5,The Cream of Clapton,"I ordered the cd I believe on a Wed.or on late Tuesday night and recieved it on Sat. Which was several days early when I was told to except the Cd. Also, the cd was just like new cd in quality both in the quality of the sound to the artwork included in the cd. All of this made me every happy, because I recieved a better quality product than I excepted for the price that I paid for it."
2,SOUND QUALITY ON OLDER TRACKS VERY POOR.,"MANY CD'S ARE REMASTERED TO GET THE BEST SOUND QUALITY POSSIBLE. ON THE EARLIER TRACKS THE SOUND IS NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS A TAPE CASSETTE. THE OVERALL MUSIC IS EXCELLENT FOR CLAPTON FANS; HOWEVER, LOOK FOR A BETTER BEST OF VERSION."
3,Decent but Overrated,"I like Eric as a person but I must admit I think he's highly overrated as a guitarist. His soloing tends to consistently run through the same old simple blues patterns in the same old way. This compares unfavorably to his contemperaries like Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck who took blues influences but found a way to make them melodious and distinct from one solo to the next and as a result progressive. And relative to guitar heroes since then like Eddie Van Halen, forget it. I'm only giving this record 3 stars in recognition of Clapton's solid compositions and down to earth honest personality which comes through in his music."
2,Cocaine,"if you like derek and the dominos version of layla, check outthe song cocaine because it is in my opinion that it is a goodsong but not my all time favorite. I'll give this CD 2 stars because I like both these two."
5,Legendary,"A great Clapton album to set you on the way for many more. I gurantee when you here this whole album about two times you will call it one of your best cd's. With great classics like, ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and ""Layla"" for me were the only Clapton songs I really knew I liked. But after I heard the whole album I knew it was worth more than for what I bought it. Buy it now. Listen and be stunned with great guitar work!"
4,"Like cream, it skims the very best of Eric Clapton very well","****1/2It is very hard to represent the very best of Clapton's career on one CD. However, this CD does a very excellent job of doing just that.First, this compilation only covers the Polydor years (from I Feel Free by Cream up to I Can't Stand It from 1981). Therefore, later hits like Forever Man, and I've Got A Rock and Roll Heart (Warner Brothers) are not included.Only one hit of any consequence is missing: Lay Down Sally. Strange Brew would have also been welcome, and After Midnight is presented as a single edit due to time constraints (the disc runs over 79 minutes.Excellent liner notes plus superb sound makes this the one choice to own if you want only one Clapton CD."
5,Thin and Easy to Use,Great product if you need your applique to be as close to the thickness of the fabric as possible. Easy to use too.
5,Mistyfuse,"Excellent service and product. Oh, for crying out loud. What else is there to say? Good stuff, nice people, fast."
2,broken pony,I bought this set of pony's for my 2 girls who are finatics. They are cute and each come in their own metal box. One of the pony heads was broken off when my daughter first open the box. It's not worth sending it back for a replacement. The return shipping will cost more than the pony. The other 5 ponies were good.
4,Cute for the pony-loving girls...,"My daughter is 6 & loves ponies & horses. She had the larger MLP set & this is a nice accompaniment for those. She pretends that they are the babies, of course...Their heads move & each is in a different pose.The tins are nice & sturdy for what they are- but like anything made of tin- keep them off of the floor or they will get crushed.Somehow, we ended up with 5 ponies & one duplicate, instead of 6 different? All ok, however, as my daughter pretends they are ""twins"" (gotta love kids!)- lol.Just grab a set. They're cute, come in their own little tin & are a nice gift for any little girl."
3,"Ponies are very small, but nicely packaged","These are no larger than 2"" and do not move. The pose that they are in are all. No hair to comb either, but I must say they made a great party favor. Box is aluminum and not very sturdy."
3,Super tiny My Little Ponies,"I was shocked when the package arrived. These aren't just tiny, they are super tiny. All six together fit in a very small box.They are cute, but not what I expected."
1,Not an easy option,"Unfortunately, the inflating hair basins like these don't work well. They are uncomfortable to lay in, draining is difficult, and they don't hold water well. Using a trash bag draped across the side of the bed is a better choice."
1,This product is disabled,"This product is more disabled than the user it is intended forAs other reviewers have said .....the drain does NOT work which defeats the entire purpose of this basin.Also.....the "" cutout "" area for the neck is too small for most necks also defeating the purpose of this basin.Thankfully this product does deflate which will make it easier to dispose of in the trash"
5,BUY THIS! Durable and works GREAT... + you certainly WON'T get anything better in stores.,"I bought this shampoo basin for my elderly Grandmother who wanted me to wash her hair. There are other ways to wash a bed-ridden person's hair; however I found those techniques to be quite hard and somewhat frustrating. Why not buy a shampoo basin that allows less strain on the washer's back and more comfort for the person having their hair washed? I searched for days for a shampoo basin in stores which only resulted in my purchasing it on Amazon. So glad I did, because I also purchased the water hose. The material is durable and very easy to inflate + deflate. YOU WILL NEED A PUMP TO INFLATE (it does NOT come with one). I used my fitness ball pump to inflate it and that did the job well."
1,hair basin,"This product isn't what I had envisioned. The plastic has rough edges around where the head goes, the hose to drain the water didn't work. It kinked constantly. It is large and cumbersome, does not work for someone that is truly bedridden."
2,Worked well for a while,"I thought this was a really good idea and it seemed to work well for a while, but after a year of use it sprung a leak on a seam that could not be repaired. Unfortunately the leak got progressively worse which rendered the basin useless. If it was made out of better quality material I believe that would not have happened."
5,Very nice,"This works wonderfully. Only got to use it once on my mother before she became too weak even for it, but she really enjoyed having her hair washed and said her head fit in the basin comfortably. This is a very good buy."
5,good to have,When you want to wash you hair and can't get to sink or shower works great I know I've been there
2,Hair wash Basin Inflatable EZ Shampoo for Disabled,Does not empty properly. Causes a lot of water around patient's head and difficult to use. I would not recommend it.
4,"Nice, but a pain to assemble","Arrives in pieces as you would expect. The screws are placed into plastic anchors to hold the tubes together.The issue wouldn't have been too difficult if some genius thought of using allen wrench screws rather than phillips. My wrist was sore for a while after words making sure the screw driver didn't constantly slip out. Once finished, its rather nice."
4,"Sturdy, but clunky","This is the perfect solution to keep track of receipts, bills, personal paperwork at home, and other ""things-to-do"" that accumulate throughout the work-week. It's also very sturdy, and the trays also slide in and out. Like the other reviews have noted, you'll have to assemble this yourself. However, it's a fairly intuitive process, and took me less than five minutes to put everything together. I actually didn't read all the reviews prior to purchasing, but I just glimpsed at some of the newer reviews to get a starting point for my own review--I'm surprised that so many people have complained about the assembly. It's pretty straightforward and simple, and if you start from the bottom-up, you should be fine. My only issue with this tray is that it's a little clunky, but still, it's not that bad-looking either :]."
1,Not just inexpensive but cheaply made,"I ordered this item because it looked like just what I wanted for my office desk. The pieces looked ok when the package arrived. However, when I started trying to put it together I realized just how poor the hardware quality was. To attach the round tubes to the upright side frames, metal screws were provided. To make the screws fit tightly into the tubes, there were plastic drywall screw inserts in the bag of hardware. I tried to work with this odd assortment but it was impossible. I'm a structural engineer and after spending about half an hour on just ONE screw, I gave up. I'm going to come up with my own adapters because I don't want to bother returning the item - the frame is all pretty good. But I suggest that if you need this type of organizer, you order a different one."
2,bigger than advertised,"This item is actually 11-5/8"" wide x 13-3/4"" deep x 10-5/8"" high.As you can see, it is advertised as 10 3/4"" wide x14 1/4""x 11""I needed it to fit in a cabinet beside my printer and measured the space available for it. The size advertised would have fit, but the item as it actually is will not fit. The packaging on it confirms that it is this model Sparco 90206 and clearly shows the dimensions as the larger ones, not those advertised.Such a hassle. I'll be sending it back and shopping around some more.If the size had been correct, I'd give it more stars. It's fine if it had the correct dimensions."
2,good in theory,What drew me to this type of tray was that the trays moved so it was easy to retrieve whatever was in the tray. The reality of the matter is the trays aren't very stable and you cant put much in them. And the slide backwards as well. i lost a lot of papers behind my desk for that very reason. The stand doesn't like to stay put either. Its not very sturdy and it slides very easily. Another way I lost a lot of papers. There are enlough trays in the world to skip over this one and find something better made.
3,hard to assemble,"I am an engineer and this tray was difficult to assemble. The tray looks nice in my office but due to the assembly issues, the tray isn't very sturdy."
3,Decent for the price,"Looks as pictured. It required assembly and did not have any instructions but was pretty self-explanatory to figure out and took less than 5 minutes. My one disappointment is that it does not sit flat on the surface - one leg does not sit on the flat surface. However, it will work for my needs."
4,BETTER than expected...,"For $11 I wasn't expecting much, and I read a number of reviews here that said it was SO cheap and flimsy that is was practically unusable. Well I got mine yesterday and put it together, and for the price I paid I am very satisfied. Everyone that says it sits lopsided just needs to balance it out. Mine only rested on 3 of 4 legs at first, then I loosened the screws and pressed it down 'til they all sat flat and then tightened them back down. For what it is and the price paid I would definitely recommend."
3,Cheaply made but does the job.,"The poles came uneven, which caused it to wobble. I bent it to straighten it out, and it works fine now."
3,"3 tier desk tray, Steel Mesh",Easy to assemble. Make sure you do not put too much of a load to each tier. Support portion of tray will pull apart and fall onto the lower tray.
2,one of these things is not like the other,"I ordered 2 of these desk trays and although they were ordered at the same time from the same place and even shipped together, they came in different packaging and were NOT the same product. One was sturdy, easy to put together, and well made. The other was none of those things. It is so wobbly that the top drawer will randomly fall out of the tracks. They look similar but the sturdy one has threaded metal bars that connect the sides, while the other has metal bars with some sort of plastic inside that you're supposed to put the screw into. It is way to easy to put the screws in just a little off center leading to the entire thing being wobbly.If this was just the sturdy design, it would have been 5 stars..."
2,poor quality,"The trays look nice, but the functionality is lacking. the trays do NOT slide in and out easily. They get stuck because the rack is not properly aligned. I thought it was something I did wrong, so I took it apart and put it back together again. That didn't help. One of the racks fits properly and slides well, but the other two do not. I don't recommend purchasing this item. Perhaps there is nothing one out there of better quality."
1,"Probably a great product, but listed dimensions are way off!","I bought this because I have a small cabinet space where I wanted to store it. When I purchased this (and at the time of this review), the dimensions listed on Amazon's description are 11"" Height x 10.25"" Width x 14.25"" Depth. Based on that description, I would have more than 1"" of wiggle room to fit this.Unfortunately, the product turned out to be larger than stated. The real dimensions (even stated on product packaging!) are 11 5/8"" Width x 13 3/4"" Depth x 10 5/8"" Height. Normally, I could forgive a person for mixing up the width, depth, or height. But when you can't even match up the numbers, that is unforgiveable.Needless to say, I have returned the product because it's too large for my space. I made note of the error in my RMA, so hopefully they correct it. The product is probably great, but too bad I never got to really test it out."
3,Gets the job done,"It's handy. Does the job, no unfortunate quirks. Easily holds standard sized letter pages, and the construction is sturdy enough to load entire reams on."
3,Nice little desk tray but not so easy to assemble,"I received this desk tray, opened up the box, took out all the parts and was naturally looking for instructions for assembly (I did not note the reviews that also said there were no instructions) and I found none but I figured it should not have been too hard to put together. It is harder than it looks. Took me about 15 minutes because I had to use not only a screw driver but another tool to hold the bars in place while tightening the screws - it is somewhat easy to figure out but it is harder than it should be to put something so simple together. However, once assembled, the basket is space efficient and has a sleek look."
3,"Looks nice and it is effective, but very wobbly","I like the look of this desk tray and think it's a decent value. However, the legs of the tray are very unbalanced with only 3 of the 4 legs touching the desk at the same time. I guess you get what you pay for...."
2,Disappointing build quality ruins an otherwise good item,"I really wanted to be happy with this product. It's not terribly expensive, but it's also not a complex product.The problem is that the unit I received had very misshapen trays. This means they don't fit properly into the shelves of the frame and wobble around.It's not as noticeable when they are full of papers but extremely so on a light load.The construction of this item is also cheaper than I expected. Rather than having pre-drilled threads when putting the frame together instead you screw into a plastic cap. I found this made it hard to construct the main frame straight, as well as being much harder work. I assume it would also make it hard to dismantle the item and reconstruct it."
2,Poor workmanship,"I really wish I just had the balance issue that others had. My issue is with one of the rods. It's bent or the grooves for the screw to go in aren't straight and it won't allow a screw to go in more than a couple turns...so of course I can't put any of the trays in as the sides aren't close enough to support them. What a shame, it was a really nice product. Will return for a new one and hope the second one doesn't have the same issue."
2,a complete criticism of the egytian beliefs& traditions,"THIS BOOK IS A FARCE-IT COMPLETELY RUINS ALL BELIEFS ABOUT,AND THEORIES ON,THE TYPICAL DAILY LIFE OF ANCIENT EGYPT.IT IS A RUTHLESS ATTACK ON THE CONCRETELY DISCOVERED FACTS ABOUT THE ANCIENT WORLD.NOT WORTH PRINTING,LET ALONE READING."
5,Great 70's throwback,"Good...no Great music!!!This is a multipurpose music. I ride out to it in my car, I make love to my girlfriend while listening to it. Great Great album. I recommend to everyone please buy this album! Feels like a Shaft movie!"
5,Delightful double-dip of music from a great artist,"Polydor's anthology of Roy Ayers' recordings showcases a wealth of jazz-funk fusion from the artist who produced some fine albums during the '70s such as ""Red, Black and Green"" and ""Virgo Red"". Ayers was a popular performer and a favorite on progressive stations that seemed never to get enough of his music that featured funky, earthy rhythms to go with his excellent vibraphone sound and his gritty vocals. Both CDs are great but perhaps a nod can go the to the second disc which has ""Searchin'"", the classic ""Running Away"", ""Freaky Deaky"", ""Love Will Bring Us Back Together"" and ""Destination Motherland"". CD 1 also packs a wallop, with ""We Live in Brooklyn, Baby"", ""Des Nude Sol"" and ""Everybody Loves the Sunshine"" among the fine tunes in this collection."
5,Great Resource!,"A great list of topics that young adults often have to deal with and find Biblical answers concerning. Has references and includes the actual verse! It also usually ends each section with a verse of hope, something that is so often forgotten. The only problem I have is very cosmetic- the cover is fluorescent orange. It may have been a ""cool"" color when published, but teens these days may have problems with displaying it on a bookshelf. However, the information inside is worth a book cover. Get a copy- it's good for adults too!!"
5,Great Book!,Fast Delivery! And a great book whenever you have questions. This book can be for all ages. I have it with me all the time.
2,Compilation of verses only,A good resource if you are looking for a compilation of verses by topic. Does not include any devotions or narrative content.
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed. The book had a lot of potential, yet it failed to deliver.What was perhaps my biggest issue with this book was the setting. In essence it was a great setting, but like I said, it failed to deliver. The author failed to make me love the world. This resulted in me not really caring when Morgarath attacked, or was preparing, to attack. I don't really care much if he wins. That may sound shallow, but it's the sad truth.When it came to characters, he failed as well. They seemed shallow and clichéd. I did, however, develop a great bond with Will's horse, Tug. I also liked Halt, even though his characteristics were somewhat cliché as well.Besides that there were problems with the story ending feeling too conclusive and not exactly leaving the reader dying to read the next book and also many technical issues with the writing, primarily the P.O.V. that bugged me. I honestly have no idea whether I will continue reading the series or not."
2,Okay for kids,"It's hard to quibble that a book is too childish when it's written for children, but as an adult, I didn't care for this.I thought the characters were very simplistic (every ""good"" character was incredibly noble and the absolute best at what they did) and the plot was equally predictable.I did not think the writing was very good. I agree with the reviewer who said the POV kept slipping and too much ""explaining"" was done. I will add that the books were also anachronistic -- a battle school straight out of the 20th century and an apprentice complaining about the lack of hot showers. And no, it's not a history book but it would be so easy to make things a little more authentic.Yes, I know it's intended for kids and I probably would have thought it was fine at that age. As an adult, the only thing I can say is that there's nothing inappropriate in the book -- the kids even drink non-alcoholic beer."
5,Finished in 1 night!!,"I give this book 5 out of 5 stars, because it is action packed and has super fun adventures. I recommend this book for ages 8 to adult. This is a super cool series! I can read this book in a few days I like it that much!"
5,"Rangers Apprentice, an awesome book!!!",Rangers Apprentice is an amazing action packed adventure.It is set in mid-evil times with a lot of mythology. It is about a boy named Will who becomes a rangers apprentice. Long ago there was an evil person named Morgarath who was banished from the kingdom of Araluen. Morgarath now lives in the Mountains of Rain. While he was there he gathered some Wargols witch are fearsome beasts that now fight for him. Morgarath later found two beasts ten times more fearsome than Wargols they are called the Kalkaras. While Will is being trained by his master named Halt they go on a mission to find and kill the Kalkaras. Can Will defeat the Kalkaras? Read the book and find out! I recommend this for readers ages 9-14. By Donut
3,Extensive Bullying,"All that Will ever wanted in life was to follow in his father's footsteps and become a warrior. However, when battle school refuses his application, he finds himself apprenticed to a mysterious and possibly magical ranger. With his fate decided the question is: What do rangers do?The Ruins of Gorlan is an enjoyable read, but ends when the story is finally about to get started. It contains extensive bullying, beating, animal/creature attacks, killing, injuries, and a kiss. This book is best treated as a setup for the rest of the series as it does not really provide a truly satisfying tale in and of itself. Recommended if you plan to read more than just the first book."
4,Adventure,An excellent coming of age adventure story for young adults and like me the young at heart. I highly recommend the book.
5,Mind blowing book for adults,"I am turning 34 and this is the best fantasy book I came across. LOTR is a great book but it is slow paced and too detailed. If you are looking for real page turned, fast paced adventure which occupies your mind this is the book for you!"
5,LOVED this whole series!,"I checked out this first book from the library on a whim, and after reading it knew I had to have the whole series. I went through all eight books pretty quickly and then gave them to my teenage daughter to read. She loved them, too. We can't wait for the next book. Danger, excitement, adventure, great characters and completely clean. What more could you want in a series?"
5,best book ever,this is a really good book i highly recomend it to any reader. iv read all the books in the series and they are all really entertaining. if you arent sure wether to get it or not the answer is yes.
5,Great Series,"These books are full of action, humor and archery. Definitely a great read for anyone who loves medieval fantasy and action."
5,None,"a book for people who are fed up w/ overpowered magic chosen one books(harry potter, percy jackson ect.) it is very original only slighty based of the dunedain from lotr. in fact,it ranks among lotr and is better than harry potter."
5,Awesome read!,I first read this book in 7th grade and i immediately fell in love with the story and characters. iam 17 now and i still read them and try to get each new one as they come out. recommended from elementary to adult hood!
5,Wonderfully written,"A masterful series written with plenty of action and a set of characters that are very relatable. As the series goes on so do the growing up and maturing of the characters. Many life lessons learned by reading, lots of action and humerous characters."
5,A simply entertaining fantasy,This book along with the entire series is just an overall enjoyable read. It is not complicated and it is a very linear story; rather predictable but at the same time it captivates you to keep reading. Far from lacking because of it's simplicity the author really does a fantastic job of portraying exactly what is happening in the story and the character development is very entertaining to follow. A fantastic children's series for the young and young at heart.
5,husband loves it,"Yes this book was for my very intelligent husband that needed something light hearted to read when he wasn't in the mood to read Stephen Hawkings or Raye Meres..... anyway, he seems to be enjoying the series of books."
2,Not recommended...,"As a reader, I had really mixed feelings about this book. Although the story wasn't bad and the characters were likeable, I found that author's style of writing to be lackluster at best. It seemed that Flanagan had bought a truckload of adverbs and was just itching to use them - every verb seemed to have one attached. I also lost count of the number of times a scene ground to a halt with unnecessary, long-winded description of a location, a character's shoes, or some historical tidbit. While some of this information might have been important, placing it so often in the middle of dialogue made a lot of the book feel like stop-and-go traffic."
4,Simply fun,"Great coming of age story, about a boy on the cusp of manhood and the decisions life wants him to make.Similar to the first book in the Rift War series in many ways... and equally good."
5,Get it now!!!!!,"Book was very good. But it took a while to get the story goin,But it was very good from there"
4,Fun Story,Reading this along with my son. Been an excellent read. The stories have just the right amount of twist and intrigue for young readers
5,Great Book!,This is a very good book. It kept me reading throughout the night! 5 Stars! I own all of them.
5,Great Book,My husband loves reading young adult books. He said many are better than those written for adults and this series was one of those that are better than the adult sci-fi. He had book 1 read in 2 days and couldn't wait to get to the rest of the series.
4,Review,I enjoyed the book but at times I thought it was to confusing so that is why I gave it a 4 out of 5.
3,Good book for 8-13 year olds,"My son read this when was 9 and really liked it. He has since graduated to Robert Jordan, and he now likes that. I read this myself to discuss with him, and found it was decent. I've seen negative reviews that knock it for not following traditional social structure and norms of other fantasy books, but I think that is way over-analyzing a kids book."
4,Rangers Apprentice The Ruins of Gorlan,"The Rangers Apprentice is a breath taking novel where you will find yourself biting your finger nails throughout the book. The writer uses a unique style of in most cases writing about Will and then the next chapter is about Horace his former wardmate. Although, in some parts you will find that the book may be repetitive as he uses 1 or 2 pages for explanations. This is nothing to worry about because this will lead to action and the start to adventures. This book is a great book 9-10+ year olds."
5,A cliffhanger,"I'm 9 yrs old, but this book might be too hard for most 9 year olds, 'cause there are a lot of hard vocabulary words in it and the whole series (I'm on Book 10 now). For example: Credence, rife, obsequious, and one of my favorites, undermined. But besides that, this is a great book!"
4,Jeanne in her Glory,"Rather a Gallic cross between CAPOTE and HAROLD AND MAUDE, here's the story of the last love affair of literary lioness Marguerite Duras and the decades-younger object of her affection. Duras was surely one of the most self-absorbed icons of the 20th century -- difficult to avoid feeling she ever had a random encounter that wasn't fodder for a novel, film or essay -- but Dayan's intelligent screenplay and sure direction offer a superb opportunity for an actress of a certain age, and Moreau seizes it with both hands. Her ability to fascinate has not dimmed a whit with the passage of time, and it's glorious to see an actress looking her years and yet still radiantly beautiful. Would make a fascinating evening's viewing alongside THE LOVER. Recommended."
5,Outstanding!,"I've had this piece for several years now, and it continues to be one of my favorites when it comes to serveware. I get so many favorable comments on how striking the pan is, it makes me want to buy more pieces from the line. Clean-up is a breeze and it's just the right size for a truly authentic pan of bubbly lasagna! I recommend this pan highly, if you can still find it!"
1,Incomplete order but not incompelete charge,I ordered this set of two (reasonable price for two used) and ONLY got one movie (MI II) with no word electronic or otherwise about the other. Unbeleivable.
4,Rougher Version,"This is the original release of this show. The mix is a bit weird, and the vocals are out front with the guitars mixed low. The later release was remixed and doesn't have this issue. This version has one song not on the ""King Biscuit"" version (Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell); that version has two songs not on this version (Winners and Losers/Scene of the Crime & Cold Metal). So, if you want the complete show, you still need both versions.As for the performance, it is top-notch. Iggy is very vocal between songs, more so than on any other recording I've heard from this tour. Even songs that were medicore on the album (Squarehead, Easy Rider, High on You) shine in their live incarnations."
1,Thin and cheap feeling,"I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift, but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store, and it's not even worth the dollar.Very cheezy item."
2,Not really ripped my vest,I fould that really mainstream. Nothing that made me excited or thinking this was really different. Honest piece of work.
5,Helped remove water stains from my stainless steel dishwasher,"Last year we remodeled our kitchen and purchased stainless steel appliances. To my dismay, our Bosch dishwasher developed water drip stains down the front as did our Electrolux range. I tried a few methods of removal, but none worked. I read the reviews on Cerama Bryte Stainless Steel Cleaning polish and decided to give it a try. To my delight, it worked to diminish the stains. It's taken a few coats on the dishwasher, but the stains are much less noticeable. The refrigerator gleams and as a bonus, the over the range microwave now resists fingerprints. That was always a point of frustration. The mineral oil in the polish helps keep the appliances clean. Stainless steel appliances are pretty, but the upkeep is more difficult."
2,Not so great,Because of all the great reviews I decided to try this brand. I am not at all impressed. There are water drip spots that it just won't remove. It just doesn't do a very good job.
4,Cerama Bryte Stainless Steel Polish,THis did a great job of cleaning a film off my stainless steel refrigerator that is located between my cooktop and my wall oven and thus gets a build-up. It removed the film that my other cleaners couldn't budge but it did leave a slightly smeary finish that I had to use a different cleaner to remove.
2,Not Impressed,I read the other reviews when I purchased this product. I have an entire kitchen of Electrolux Stainless Steel. The Dishwasher has water stains going all the way down the front of it and this product did nothing to remove them. On the refrigerator doors there is permanent hand marks that once again it didnt remove and I used a lot of elbow grease. For everything else it did ok leaving a nice deep look.
5,Amazing,This is a fantastic product. I have purchased numerous other brands from local stores but never found a product that would clean as well as this product nor would it protect the finish from future marks and smudges. I highly recommend this product if you have stainless steel appliances.One additional benefit was using this product on my sink. Because it contains mineral oil (to prevent future smudges) if you use it on a sink the water will bead up and roll away. This keeps my sink cleaner for longer which means I don't have to use as much solution.
5,Best product ever!,"I have tried several stainless cleaners with no success. Then, my daughter received a sample of Cerama Bryte with her new stainless frig and we were sold! She explained to me that using the product straight from the little sample squirt bottle works best. Working quickly, shake well and apply with a paper towel and then polish with a clean towel. Using the product from the spray bottle doesn't work as well. I believe the product separates in the spray tube, so therefore you don't get the right mix of product. And even though you shake the bottle, the product doesn't mix well in that small tube. So, what I do now is shake up my large spray bottle well and pour the product into my small squirt bottle as needed. Works perfectly! The best product out there!"
5,Great Stainless steel cleaner!!!,I've tried a few stainless steel cleaners and this is the ONLY one that doesn't leave those nasty streaks. Love this stuff and will definately keep it on hand. I would highly recommend this product!
5,Great Cleaning Polish for Hawaii,I have a lot of stainless steel that is exposed to he ocean air in Hawaii and this cleaning polish works great. It protects the stainless steel from the corrosive salt spray. The price was perfect and the free shipping to HI made the purchase a no-brainer.
3,Works on some types of stainless steel,"When it works, it's great. But it doesn't work on all types of stainless steel. I sure wish appliance manufacturers would offer a standardized stainless steel, so one product would work on all appliances."
1,Trickey,Cerama Bryte Stainless Steel Cleaning Polish (with Mineral Oil) Don't waste your money on it. I've tried every way to get it not to strick it leaves a very dull finish. I used differnt clothe's went different directions-wiped it off quickly-wiped it after a few minutes and this was on a new refigerator.I gave up and just washed it off and it looks better.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O2O9BU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
4,Good cleaning polish,"I used this polish on my Wolf stainless steel top and it did remove much of the brown stains that had accumulated over the past several months. Since you can't use anything but a nonabrasive sponge-type cleaner on these tops, it is difficult to get all the cooking stains off. But this polish did a good job at removing most of them."
5,wonderful.,First stainless steel cleaner that actually took off water spots and runs. It has got to be the added mineral oil in this product. It is the best there is.
4,Interesting,"Complete in criteria for the men of those times, embarked in the ambitious project of modernity, yet for these times incomplete, which is absolutely comprehensible. The ""problem of man in space"" as so called by Oskar Schlemmer, protrudes on us an intense intrigue on what the new form of theater should be, should it be the translation of a piece of literature onto space ?, or should it be the craft of developing space itself into an entity of meaning. He leaves us without an answer, but suggests a better question."
4,Paulji Creates a Complex Spiritual Path,"Actually, Paul Twitchell created a ""spiritual path"" that became a ""religion"" by the current leader of Eckankar, Harold Klemp. This book represents volume one of Eckankar's Holy Books. It is Eckankar's position that this book is merely truth such as it is, and that this truth is based on the spiritual maturity of the audience at the time the book was written. For the reader to discover higher truths the seeker is advised to read the book on the Astral plane (where other volumes are kept). There could be several versions of truth for any particular topic, which would fit the consciousness of the reader.The book is very interesting and has some very useful information. However, the reader must keep in mind that there is much dogma interwoven into this book. This book is more for members of Eckankar than for the general public, and parts of this book will seem complex and confusing for anyone except a very well grounded High Initiate."
5,Essential ECK guide for all Eckists,"I must admit, this book is good,very good. The Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad book one, is a totally unique presentation of the microcosm and it's understanding is essential before taking on The Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad book two, which offers a totally unique presentation of the macrocosm. Excellent books of one of the world's most successful new age religions. Highly recommended!!!!"
1,The Shariyat (Poorly Written),"The book is poorly constructed and difficult to understand due to Twitchell's peculiar style. The poetic stanzas throughout are stale, rigid, and seem to have been thrown together like a patchwork quilt. The supposed ancient spiritual history through out the book reads like a 1920's science fantasy. I have discovered that portions of chapters four and five ""appear"" to be lifted right out of Robert Howards books of the 30's; especially when Twitchell discusses the ""Polarian"" and other ""root races of mankind."" I would say let the buyer beware."
2,Not enough,"I purchased this issue as a replacement for an older edition of the same title that I have. My older version is a translation by J.F. scanlan (Essay Index Reprint Series)by the Books for Libraries Press.I was disappointed in this particular issue because some of the essays that I expected to be in the volume were not. Specifically, Frontiers of Poetry.I will be returning this edition and will try to locate a good used copy of the 1971 reprint. Besides, I really like having all the endnotes.If you want a better edition of this title try ISBN 0836922417P.S. The binding on this edition is cruddy."
1,Not an accurate reprint!,"Very large type, parts missing when scanned and generally a poor copy! I recommend anyone wanting to read Art And scholasticism to get the full volume."
4,Childrens classic,I used to read this book to my children when they were little. My recent purchase of this book was for my grandchildren! I hope they enjoy sitting in my daughters lap at bedtime as she used to sit in mine so many years ago.
2,yuck,"I received this as a gift to go with my Senseo machine and it didn't taste like good,real coffee. All I can say is yuck."
3,Good Coffee BUT NOT STRONG,"I Love Yuban, but this pod only makes a decent 4 ounce cup, otherwise it is too weak, I was suprised the Senseo Extra Dark was much better and the same price ($3.99)at my local Target. I have a Melita ONE:ONE machine, you just have to squish these pods in a little, work fine."
5,One of the Best,"Originally titled ""Ian Mackaye"" with an extremely large butt hole on the cover which leads you to believe the title was Ian Mackaye is an a-hole (banned in the uk). This contains some of their best work with good mondo bass hummin through out the recording. It includes the colossal track ""Hangover Heart Attack"" which was used to start many of their shows. If you don't have Dysfunctional Songs For Codependent Addicts your missin out. Buy with War All The Time (lp) and you'll be a happy drunkin camper!CHEERS!"
4,Of course one of their best albums is out of print.,"Come on, get this back in print! This is the notorious ""Ian Mackaye"" record. I have the LP but it's in pretty bad shape and need to get the CD.Make sure you have Feel the Darkness and War All The Time by these guys.And check out Mighty High...In Drug City."
1,A Piece of Junk,"I had a couple of Zebco spincast rods and reels similar to this when I was a kid. They were generally reliable, so I thought one of these would make a good first rod for my 5 year old daughter. But I picked this model up for her last weekend and it just doesn't work. Sometimes it will cast as far as 4 or 5 feet. Most of the time it locks up and does nothing at all, even though I am operating the thing properly.This reel is unfortunately a completely piece of junk. Literally, you'd be better off tying some line to a flexible stick."
2,not the one I ordered,"haven't used it yet, it is for our 3 year olds birthday, she has been begging for a pink fishing pole. The one that came was NOT the one I ordered, which bummed me out, cause the one they sent, I had seen cheaper at walmart (& others on here with eligable for FREE SHIP & this one did not)but ordered the OTHER want I wanted when I found it here, I was disappointed, but it is still a pink fishing pole, so I guess that will work."
3,Fun for kids,It basicly does what it has to for those little beginers. basic is what discribes it best.
5,Awesome,"Clapton & Co. kick off the album with an excellent ""Layla"" which gets your blood pumping, and the rest of the CD never lets up. Highlights include a great version of the Cream hit ""Badge"", several great Derek and the Dominos songs, and several classics from Eric's first solo album. My only complaint is the absence of ""Keep On Growing"", one of my favorite Dominos songs. But this concert is still excellent. Clapton, Townshend and the band totally rock the house."
5,One of the best live albums ever,"Anyone who says this cd is subpar to the original release must be on Heroin themselves. It's FAR better sounding. And the performance? Anyone who says that this is a subpar performance to the Dominoes live, or Just One Night- well, I'm afraid they don't get it either. This is classic stuff. Raw, not rusty. Yeah, maybe they hadn't rehearsed 100 times. That makes it sound that much more lively and off the cuff. Don't let anyone dissuade you from this. This is a fine musical performance. Probably my favorite, best sounding live release."
5,A little gem you shouldn't overlook,"You may notice that the songs are a little shaky. This is one of the greatest parts. At one point the string on his guitar broke, but what did slowhands do? He kept on playing. He is also accompanied by Pete Townshend of The Who and Ronnie Wood. This is a great little addition to the cd, but probobly why it is so overlooked. If you enjoy a good blues song then buy this cd."
4,Wish I was old enough to be there,"The cd release has a lot of unreleased tracks that are done well. Although I would recommend ""Live at the Fillmore"" by Derek and the Dominos, Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert is a great cd to have. A band of known superstars bringing Clapton out of seclusion and giving him the confidence to perform his material again in front of a live crowd."
4,Thank God for Technology,"When this album originally appeared it contained only six songs and the sound was exciting as chalk on a sidewalk. But now, thanks to the modern techno, the original song list has been fleshed out and the sound is quite subperb. These additions and enhancements have made this album rank with the guess Who`s Live at the Paramount as one of the magnificent little gems that seems to have been overlooked by the majority of music fans. A recording of E.C.`s first concert in over two years gives the listener the feel of a group of friends on a one off get together. The music is a little ragged in spots but that is one of the charms. The on-stage banter is fun, but the power is all Eric. He seems as if he had never left the stage, plus a live version of Layla, what more could you ask for. A definite little nugget you`ll enjoy."
5,"A ""Must have"" item.","From a time when Eric Clapton was completely at the bottom of his life with drugs, alcohol, and with great sadness that Pattie Boyd gave him her NO! 3 years earlier. His friend Pete Townshend gave him a little of the good life back. Many of the tracks are from ""Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs"" and recorded live with high quality. Pattie Boyd was also at the concert and all the songs were for her. If you are happy to hear Eric Clapton is this CD a ""must-have"". The soul gets deep ...Ole Nielsen / DenmarkTranslated from Danish to English via Google"
4,Fully Loaded With Great Guitar,"Thank you Pete Townsend for bringing Eric Clapton out of his seclusion. This is one good disc which features much prime time material from Eric. Many highlights include Layla, Presence Of The Lord, Tell The Truth, and Badge. Eric sounds in good spirits considered all the drug abuse he had gone through. The keyboards are muffled in spots and the tone of all the songs lacks some variety. Otherwise its high quality all the way."
1,Was disappointing at the time; still disappointing,"When they released this album in 1973 it was panned for being technically not very good, and it isn't good technically or otherwise. There's really not much to say: good to see Clapton return from heroin addiction, though his then girlfriend Alice appears to have been less lucky, but really he was lackluster that night (I was sitting second row). Of historical interest only to Clapton buffs."
3,Getting There,"Eric returns but not in full swing...the songs are ok, but Clapton is visibly nervous and his solos justify it. 1974-1978 were the REAL goldmine years....THAT'S WHEN HE WAS IN FULL FLIGHT."
3,A Non-Essential Musical Artifact,"While the ""Rainbow Concert"" marks Eric Clapton's comeback from drug addiction in the mid-1970s, it is forClapton completists only (or fans of Blind Faith, due to Steve Winwood's prominent role here). While the songselection is superb, these live versions add no new revelations to the originals. And, like most live albums fromthe 1970s, primitive technology results in muddled sound quality (which is only slightly improved throughremastering). Stick with E.C.'s studio recordings instead."
2,Not the best commentary,"After teaching through most of 1 Corinthians now, I have to say that I am disappointed by this commentary. While I have other examples of the NIV Application Commentary series (such as K. Lawson Younger's excellent work on Judges/Ruth), Dr. Blomberg's volume is simply not very good. In many cases, there seems to have been a lack of effort put into the ""Original Meaning"" sections, resulting in thin discussions and a lack of detail. The ""Bridging Contexts"" sections are somewhat better, but things fall flat again in the ""Contemporary Significance"" sections, as Blomberg sometimes pushes what are evidently his own somewhat liberal points of view that lack scriptural basis in certain areas. Of the four commentaries that I read before teaching regarding this epistle, this is my least favorite."
2,too little - too soon,"Leonard Maltin put this book out too soon. It seems like a rush job.There are hundreds of films repeated from his classic and, what is worse, there are hundreds of available films that he skips. Many films on TCM this month (April) where missing. The book is needed but it needs more work to fill the void. It should be reworked totally as it is really needed."
1,Leonard Maltin`s Ripoff,"I heard that Leonard Maltin was putting 1960 & older films in a separate book so I decided to purchase a copy along with the annual movie guide. When I started looking through the 2006 edition, I noticed that there were still hundreds of 1960 & older films still listed. So I decided to compare both guides page by page. The same old films are listed in BOTH guides! I feel totally ripped off."
4,Movie Guide,Just what I expected and meets my requirements for the purchase as made and the service was very good and on time.
1,Classic Ripoff,"""Classic"" implies a degree of excellence. Instead, this book is merely a compilation of movies from the silents through the 50's without regard to merit---from bomb to 4 star. I bought this thinking it was devoted to truly good movies from silents to the present with the turkeys weeded out. It isn't and you would probably be better served to just buy the regular annual guide."
3,Good but not great,"I love Marvel comics' Captain America and Jack Kirby's art as well. However, these stories were a little too 'weak' and the art a little too over the top for my taste. Still, this is a good purchase if you are a fan of 70's Marvel and Jack Kirby. I recommend vol. 3 'The Swine'"
4,Their best,"It is very unfortunate that their best album is pushed least by the record company, as a matter of fact you could argue that UKJ didn't quit making great music the record company quit pushing their product. Look at it like this they went from platnum albums a few years earlier to hardly moving 60,000 units of this album (according to soundscan). Very unfortunate indeed, by this album, Milkman's Son is worth it."
2,the album sucked. it's lucky to even get two stars.,"Plane and simply, I thought this album was boring. It sucked, two stars for tomarrow's world."
5,Robert the Rose Horse pleases two generations,"This book is my absolute favorite children's book. I have my original copy, and read it to my 21 month old almost every day. He loves Robert, and yells ""Bless you Robert!"" after every sneeze. I am so glad to see its been reissued and available, as I want to buy it for my friends' children."
4,Delightful and funny,A sweet story that the children I have read it to have loved. I don't remember this book myself from growing up but it is a treasure to read.
3,your kid's first introduction to guns,"My daughter who is now almost 3-1/2 really likes this book. I have to admit, it is pretty cute. HOWEVER, as my title says, this may be your kid's first introduction to guns. There are just too many guns in the illustrations. I was pretty surprised when I ordered the book and saw that, and believe me I was not happy. My daughter does not watch TV, and I don't want her to be exposed to violence, even if only through a book. Childhood should be a time when a kid feels safe and should not have to worry about things like guns and bank robbers. Yes, eventually she will learn about those things, but it is my job as her parent to have that happen as far in the future as possible."
2,"Fun to read, except for the guns!","I agree with the last parent: It's a very fun book; Robert sneezes so much and so hard that everything falls down & so making the ""achoo"" sounds is good interactive fun. However, my 4 yr old understands that it's a bit unfair that Robert loses his job just for sneezing and knocking people over; she says ""but he coudln't help it"". So, I suppose there's a life lesson in there that much of life isn't fair. And finally the Guns! Oy, this book I guess was written when the idea that kids can play with guns is just okay. I skip over the text about how the guns go bang when robert sneezes. Buy at your own discretion; there are so many other good books without guns that I'd probably skip this one."
4,Great book for a gift,"This was one of my sisters favorite books as a kid and now that she's 35 it's a great time to give it to her again for Christmas. The book I received was in perfect condition, as it should be when brand new! Great seller :)"
4,Robert The Rsoe Horse,My children have enjoyed the story of Robert the Rose Horse. Every time I read it I smile because it reminds me of my childhood. Very cute.
2,Consequences For Looks,"I purchased a white one and it looked great.However, the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and isn't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing. It is not a smart idea to wear dark colors underneath it especially black.It's a nice brand, not worth the price and there are better ones out there."
4,Cheech is a lot of fun!,"This CD is a hoot! Our whole family loves it. It's fun. It's clean and the songs stick with you. We've learned how to make colors, add, speak Spanish, and gained advice on courage-Cheech style. The CD is way to short though, thus the 4 star rating."
5,Cheech is GREAT in English & Spanish!,"This English-Language CD is not only a great one for entertaining the kids as well as imparting some really basic Spanish-Language phrases, but you should look for the SPANISH version of the CD; everything on the English-Language version except in Spanish! Album ID RCE-74041-70543-2 BY RINCON CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINMENT."
5,Frequent book buyer,"My children and their friends loved this on the way to and from school, so I just had to buy one for my nephew. He is really enjoying it too! A fun way to pass the time on short rides around town."
1,How did this get published?,"While I'll be the first to admit that this book has some entertaining content in the form or gaming anecdotes and Vegas trivia, I can honestly say it's biggest claim to fame is the HORRIBLE writing style!I was absolutely floored by the unending samples poor grammar, unclear sentences, pointless or cliche references, obvious self-promotion (at least 4 chapters contain glowing character references for John Gollehon, who just happens to be the publisher of the book...), etc etc. I'm sure this book turned the stomach of any professional editor who happened to crack the cover.After the first 25 pages, this book had reached ""train wreck"" status with me - I was compelled to keep reading not for the content but to see how much worse it could possibly get. If you enjoy such literary self-torture, read this book. Otherwise, skip it."
3,Great stories about the casino business.,"This is a great book about the behind the scenes operations of major casinos, even if it is about 15 years behind. Mr Vinson needs to write a follow up book."
1,You couldn't pay me to read it again,This is a horrible book. It's very out date (was revised in the mid 80's) and a first grader could write a more interesting book. The stories are not that good and the data in the book is incorrect because of how old the book is.
2,"Disappointing, even for an avid Vegas Book reader","I've never been a fan of the first person narrative, which is used way too much in this book. Too many of the quotes are attributed to unnamed sources and take place in anonymous casinos, which doesn't lend much credibility to them. Most of the facts are outdated, but I gave the author a little leeway in this, as I looked at this book as an insight into Vegas in the late seventies to mid eighties. One note of interest is that for this book, Vinson is referred to as a Casino Executive, but in his later works, I have seen him referred to as a humorist, hmm ... Buyer Beware! I'd rather read Pete Earley's Super Casino a second time."
4,A Good Bird Sampling,"This is a good representative collection of Parker's bebop style. In addition to the good music, there's a nice tribute article by Phil Woods inside that includes an anecdote about a time when he lent Charlie Parker his alto sax. Also, there are brief little write ups about each of the selections on the disc. The only complaint I have, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that the cd jewel box was cracked."
5,This Is a Must Have for Any Inspired Young Musician,"I thought for a few seconds that I might give this one 4 stars instead of 5 sighting the primitive production that the original recordings suffered from. However, in this case, even with the poor production, Charlie Parker is a musician to be reckoned with. Likewise, this album is chock full of standards that any jazz musician will be familiar with. Get this album! It is a collected history of recordings that have both good song writing and stellar skill."
3,feeder funnel,The funnel workes great. I did have to cut the top band about an inch and a half lower. It was so stiff that it would not work it's way down to the bottom of the 55 gallon drum. After the trim to the top band it went down very easily. everything is installed and my feeder is working great.
5,Love Elmo & Christmas!,We love this Christmas CD! We play it all year long! I bought 2~ one for the car and one for in the house! All the songs are great!
3,gold and diamond,i want a buyer of gold and diamond in every part of the world most expecialy jordan and dubai and greece any intrested person should write now to my e mail address
4,Good adventure novel!,"An expedition to look for a downed pilot deep in the Amazon forest leeds to and adventure filled with intrigue, suprises and a handfull of twists and turns. A fast pacing novel written with intelligence and skill. The protagonist of this story, a young anthropologist who is looking for her brother (the pilot), quickly finds herself in the midst of a dangerous, intricate expedition. Whether you are an adventurer in real life or just at heart, you will love this book."
1,Damodaran study guide - old edition,"Don't think I will use this book. It's an old study guide from 1994.Damodaran on Valuation, Study Guide: Security Analysis for Investment and Corporate Finance (Wiley Professional Banking and Finance)"
4,Allow Much More Time,"This is an excellent book for planning trips in the Southwest. My wife and I used it for a three week tour based in Albuquerque and going on excursions that included Petroglyph, NM, Acoma Res., El Malpais, El Morro, Canyon de Chelly, and Chaco Culture NHP. We found the time estimates in the book to be far short of the time we spend touring an area and/or a destination. Unless you do ""New York Minute"" tours you will need to double many of the time allotments in the book. That said, the book is excellent for an overview of things to see and do in an area. It can serve as the one book to plan your trip and to take along with you."
2,Second version of a classic,"I have used the first edition of this book religiously. I find it infinitely useful. However, this second version is much less detailed and not worth the money. I would highly recommend the first edition, but skip this one."
5,"Exceptional, Fun, and Educational",Absolutely love it. I use it for my Spanish students. We perform for parents with songs from this CD. The songs are fun and the kids learn so much. They always ask me to play the songs over. I wish they would come out with another Spanish CD. Maria and Luis from Sesame Street have wonderful voices!
5,This CD is parent-friendly too!,"This CD is played the most in my house. I first checked it out from the library and went out to purchase it for myself almost immediately. Most children's music becomes annoying over time, but this CD seriously grows on you. I am only disappointed that the song, ""Sing"" was sung only in Spanish with only only line in English. It would have been better sung in English and Spanish. I plan on buying another Sesame Street CD soon because my son LOVES Elmo!"
3,"Better than others, still not great...","I own the Melitta One:One and so I have the option of making a 5oz. or 8oz. With these pods I have to make the 5oz. to make it strong enough. I enjoy a dark brew- this is getting to what I like. Perhaps I just need to accept that I will not be getting a good strong brew with any pods?! However these are strong and better then those I have tried in the past, so perhaps I will order these again."
2,Repetitive series,"I read the first three books in this series after reading the Anasazi mystery series. I thoroughly enjoyed the Anasazi series and expected a similar type product from these authors. The People of the ___ series seems to be the same story with the same cast of characters, same rapes and plunderings in every book. I am a big fan of series, and usually read the entire series once I start one; however, I didn't make it past #3 here. I purchased these at a second-hand book store, and am glad I only paid a buck each."
4,Never a dull story,"This is the seventh book I have read by the Gears' and I must say that their stories in the People series never let me down. There is a slight bit of repetion in the tales when it comes to situations but every character is different and their plots and twists seem to come out unique as well. This tale kept me quite enthralled and I just couldn't put it down at the end. For anyone who likes tales of Native Americans and their ancient folklore, this series is definitely a bulls eye for entertainment. Not my favorite in the series though, for that belongs to People of the Sea...or People of the Lakes? Can't decide; but those two are the Gears' at their best."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I made it through the first book with hopes that as I read it would get better. No such luck. Rarely is there a book I can't finish - this is one of them. I thought the 2nd book would continue with the characters of the first; but no...it takes up hundreds of years ( I think, it was never revealed) later with a whole new group of people that confused me. The writing is so choppy that the plot is difficult to follow. I was so disappointed as I wanted to find another series like Auel's Earth Children to captivate me."
5,One of an amazing series,Except for People of the Mist (which is not out yet) I have read every one of this series and own them all. The authors are amazing. They have the ability to draw you into the story. I felt that I was right there next the the heroes and heroines of each story. BRAVO !!!!... I look foward to their next book...People of the Mist.
2,Sequel to People of the Wolf,"This book was even poorer than the already mediocre People of the Wolf. I had decided to give the series another try, but I'm fairly sure I will not read the next ones. Fire's weakest point: it is almost the same story over again as People of the Wolf. The characters are poorly developed, which is a surprise, the themes are very modern, liberal political agendas, which is extremely out of place for the kind of book this is, and the ending is very anti-climactic and poorly timed. The Gear's make other jarring mistakes, like throwing modern anthroplogical terms into the characters dialogue, and in other ways acting like anthropologists first and story tellers second (or even third!) The premise of the book was interesting enough that I kept trudging through the text, expecting it to pick up and get better. Finally, only dogged determination not to quit kept me going until the end."
1,"Different Time, Same Characters","I read the first of this series, People of the Wolf. It did not even compare to my other favorite prehistory authors (Auel, Sarabande, Sue Harrison) but I thought that I would read the second book and give the series a chance. I laughed out loud when I realized that the book is not really a sequel when it takes place hundreds to thousands of years later, but it had the same types of characters!! The old false dreamer, the young dreamer who must choose love or dreaming, the old wise dreamer that teaches the new one (whom everyone thought was a witch or was dead), the list goes on. Get creative and not keep the same type of characters!! I was looking for a true sequel, but instead got a whole new version of the same story."
2,belies the claim of science,"I had a hard time reading this through to the end.How can a ""spiritualist"" epic claim to be science based?This novel takes place in the global warming era afterthe last great ice age. Again hard times are on the tribesand a new dreamer is needed. I've read several of thesetales and I think they are really pretty bad:the plot of this one is pretty much the same as the ""Peopleof the Wolf"". This is more like a sword and sorcery fantasythan historical science fiction. Magic or belief in itcan really be fatal for a culture."
4,Exceptional,"Ahmed Younis introduced pretty familiar ideas in his book, but his note to his peers-- a message to the youth was probably one of the more powerful things I've read. It demands that Muslim-American youth wake up, find their identities, and be ready to face the challenges that come ahead. And if they choose to accept the challenges, they will benefit the Ummah at large. Great read."
1,Pacification of dissent,"The premise of this book is misleading. Mr. younis in my opinion is a hireling of the Neo Cons who are the main drive for war against Iraq, Islam and the Muslims. His definition of a Moderate Muslim is one who divorces theology and its practice from politics. Muslims are suppose to speak out against oppression no matter what forms it takes. For a Muslim to remain silent against any oppression is one of the highest form of apostasy. And this dissent against oppression can take any form including taking up Arms. For these Neo-Mod Muslims, it is about image saving more so than substance."
4,who done it,This is a great way to catch a killer. a killer thinking he 's looking for a killer. Outanding from beginning to end. A must see.
3,An interesting plot twist,"Maybe it is not the Best Movie in the World, but I found it enjoyable, especially for the final twist. I think it was a play first and it shows: not much imagination in the scenes, a rather drab setting. But still enjoyable."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"ARRIVE IN A TIMELY MATTER (2 BUSINESS DAYS)WITH THE PACKAGE SEALED.THE CD SOUND'S GREAT, LOVE IT.THANKS"
3,Too Heavy,"This hammer was heavier than expected, weighing in at over 1.5 lbs. The handle adds too much weight to the hammer and light-weight is what I was looking for when buying this. It is also unbalanced, the logo on the front of the hammer adds weight to that side whereas the reverse side is indented. The last problem I had with it is the rubber on the handle which makes it too difficult to slide in and out of a hammer loop. It's a nice hammer and appears to be of good quality but it just won't work for me. I'm going back to my Stiletto 14 oz. Ruger Titanium head with a NEW hickory replacement handle."
4,Just what I need,"Received in time and well packed. Combination of Apple quality and convenience of pre-loaded MS Office for small price. Little heavy compare to new models.Can run skype without image, perfect screen quality. Only minus - sometimes stops internet, when searching in U-tube, Yahoo, sometimes Google too - I guess, mostly because of advertisement."
5,Great value.,"At nearly the 1 GHz speed and with identical specs, this is a great value. Also, while not mentioned here, this does include all the latest software included with more recent, faster models, including iLife (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, GarageBand), AppleWorks, Mac OS X Panther, Quicken 2004 for Mac, World Book 2004 Edition, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, and Deimos Rising. The hardware is identical to more recent, faster models as well. Aside from these notes, I can say I'm very impressed with the Mac experience, as this is my first Mac. The quality of the design of the hardware and software is unending and flawless. This is a great, lightweight (7.9 lbs) laptop for using to create documents or surf wirelessly. I highly recommend adding the Airport Extreme card, not included."
4,I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.,"This book provides interesting insight into the production designs of the cult hit film Blade Runner, released in 1982 and directed by Ridley Scott. The book was obviously prepared before shooting even started in the movie, because it provides reference material for scenes that were never produced. like the Cryo-Crypt that the real Edlon Tyrell was supposed to be sleeping in. One dissappointing thing is the way the book was printed.. brown on a tan paper, attempting to imitate some imagined 'sketchbook look'. this low-contrast method of presentation saps a great amount of detail from what were originally mostly color illustrations. But, it does provide a good look at the designs of Syd Mead (and others) for the film."
4,Good Used Item,Haven't read the book yet. I purchased it for my Dad for his birthday and had it mailed to him. He told me he received the book in good condition (as described) and was looking forward to reading it. It will make a nice addition to the books in his fishing cabin in the UP Michigan.
1,Increased Appreciation for the future,"Being a long time fan of Janis' music I looked forward to receiving this CD; but I had forgotten just how different Janis' music was after her four year layoff between ""Present Company"" and ""Stars."" There is no comparison. What intrigues me though, is that Verve positioned Janis to be a one hit wonder and provided (obviously) terrible studio/technical support, and now that she is validated as a singer-songwriter they are glad to cash in. The only good song on this album is ""Society's Child,"" and it plays better on her ""Live at the Bottom Line"" recording. Save your money for her later CDs"
2,savage and depressing,This book is full of cruelty and savagery and broken lives. I was sorry I bought it and now I'm sorry that I've read it. It will be hard to get these images out of my mind. This is not a book I will keep and I wouldn't want to pass it along to anyone either.
2,Acoma - A historical romance novel?,"While I'm only three quarters of the way through this book, it seems hard to imagine this is historical, but perhaps it is? The main theme that runs through book so far is the continual affairs of the heroine, her preoccupation with her guilt, more sex, more guilt, sex, guilt, sex guilt etc. Perhaps if I trusted some historical premis, the book would be more interesting, but I found the book extrememly slow moving, repetitive and dull for the most part."
1,Coby CD/Radio/Phone,The phone screeches when you try to use it. I have to go find a different phone whenever I answer. I would love to return it but have not had the time to figure out the return policy. The radio and CD player as well as the alarm clock are OK but the phone stinks!
2,Not a great product,I bought this phone because there was so many features in it but the phone was really static. The directory feature was not very nice. If you just need a CD player and a clock then this is a good one but the phone is not very great.
3,plastic over comode shelf,"Cost was low and quality low. Very thin plastic with cardboardback. However, good service and arrived quickly. You pay forwhat you get. I guess it's amazing you can buy items so cheaply."
1,Piece of JUNK!,"This has been the most miserable thing to install. We have 8 foot ceilings in our bathroom. The packaging states that it works for up to 8 foot 1 inch. We can not get it to tension to stay up at all. We finally got it installed, though not the way it is intended to be installed. We used command hooks to hold up the top compartment that is currently keeping it steady up. We also went and got gripper feet for the bottom hoping it would help, which didn't because we still could not get enough tension to hold it in place.We have had and used other over the toilet shelves before. This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. Don't waste your money on it. I have a feeling it will be headed to the trash sooner than later."
2,"Do not buy this, is a piece of junk","No good no only for its six inches, but thin plastic that will break itself. It is a wasting money joke"
5,Best Billie Holiday album of all times!,"Sensual, mellow and deep, amazing ambiance for lovers or nostalgic broken hearted... Billie at her best!"
4,road bike,"this bike is great if you are looking for a basic road bike and don't want to spend the $1k. It has ok components but the shifters are ancient. I did not care about that and thats why i bought it. however, something you can't see from the pic is that the bike frame has a forward lean and as such it can be uncomfortable. Today's geometry is the opposite in road bikes where the seat post is lower than the stem. I really wanted to keep the bike but i just can't ride in that position. I returned it becuase i was not comfortable ridding like that and amazon took it back no problem. If you don't mind the forward lean i would really recomend the bike and note you would be happy with it as it looks really good as well."
4,Decent Road Bike,"ProsIts very very light and just drove around 15 miles today and rides fast.My bike computer shows I clocked maximum speed of 48mph which is very impressive. 54 cm will be a very good fit for medium height riders (5'7 to 5'10). Very good sleek tires. Impressive gears. You need to tune the front derailleur properly to slip from low to high and back. I spent decent them tuning them properly. Brakes are good only if you can fix them. They didn't come fixed for me.ConsAwful seat, Brakes don come fixed with the package and you will struggle to set them right. I had to take them to a bike shop and get them fixed. Its very hard on you if you find a little bumpy road. You can feel the slightest of bumps. Hate the pedals as well. They rarely line up right for you to get your toes into the clipsSummaryGood starting road bike. Very light. Excellent speed. Hard on even slightest of bumpy roads."
1,"with this bike, purchase hiking boots","in the span of one week and 50 miles i had to return one of these bikes. i received another three days later. within three commutes, i was stranded three times: one destroyed front derailer and two flat tires. the two flat tires were within a twelve hour period and the first ride with my second kattana. i will never buy another schwinn product and i am done with amazon llc. youve got to be a terrible company to sell this junk, plus their customer service is great, probably because theyre so busy. if you hit the add to cart button, be sure to buy a pair of asolos, too."
1,Careful,I would just say be very careful with this bike. Growing up on Schwinn I loved the product in the late 90's and owned a full suspension Homegrown. For those out to get a great deal this is the bike for you. Just don't expect it to last much more than 500miles. Now if you are serious about riding that will be about 2 weeks. You do get what you pay for and the problem you are going to run into is obsolete chain store parts. There is a reason a good road bike costs upwards of 3k. I didn't even think they made a 7 speed bicycle anymore. I know just this year I had a very hard hard time finding an 8 speed cassette replacement. I don't work for a shop but when I saw this pop up on daily deals I just has to say buyer beware. I would be afraid to ride this even if it was assembled at a good bike shop.
3,OK for the money,"I got this bike as I wanted to do a sprint triathlon this past summer. I am a swimmer/runner and hadn't really ridden a bike since jr. high. I didn't want to invest thousands of dollars into a bike if I wasn't even sure if this was something I wanted to continue with in the future. To just go out and ride 20 miles or so on a Saturday afternoon, this bike definitely does the job. As a racing bike I was at a serious disadvantage though. I'll probably do another tri or 2 next summer with this bike, however after that if I decide to stick with it I will definitely upgrade. Glad I made the purchase though and I do think it was worth the money."
1,Disappointing,"Quality not there for the price. For example, had to immediately add lock nuts (9.5 mm x 26) to keep rear hubs adjusted. Also bought a large frame and needed to buy a threadless headset extension to ""match the seat."" Quality of Schwinn bikes seems to have declined in last few years."
5,Love this Bike!!!,This bike is worth every penny... It rides smooth and it's very light. I had some issues with the brakes when I got the bike but it was an easy fix.
4,can not beat the value,"you and i are no ironman, thus we have no business spending more on a road bike, then this one. though im thoroughly happy with this purchase, it did come with a bent front spoke from the factory. that could cost you 50-60$ to have a shop fix. a sizeable amount of cash relative to the cost of the bike.im having no problems avg 16-18mph through our hilly route on a bike that is easily twice as heavy as the other riders in my group.if you want to get a road bike, get this one, just know you will need to get the rear derailleur adjusted as well as the brakes.also know you will not be able to use clip-ons for those thinking of triathlon rides. the shifter placement takes up all that real state in the bars."
3,Alright...but could be better,"I would have to say that this bike is mediocre. It is a great value for a road bike, but I have had some difficulty with it since I have bought it. The front tire has gone flat twice because the insert in the rim punctured the tube twice. This was a manufacturers error. Other than that the two rides that i have had the bike on it rides very smoothly, shifts nicely and rides well. I have the 58 cm frame and am 5'11"", which might have been a little big but it works well. For a sale price of 250 bucks, you can't go wrong. Just a few mechanical updates and it will be a great bike."
5,Bike is GREAT!,"My previous bike was a steel framed ten speed from the 1970's. The new Schwinn Katana Road Bike is so light weight it is like riding on a cloud. It is truly a lot of fun! I look forward to get on it and I ride it often. The bike came very quickly after being ordered. The assembly was fairly easy. I found the front wheel was in need of being trued, probably in shipping. I called Pacific Cycle (Seller) and they told me to take it to a Schwinn Dealer, which there was one in my town. I had the wheel trued and the dealer made some minor adjustments to the index shifting for the rear derailleur. I sent the bill to Pacific Cycle and they sent me a check. Pacific Cycle has been very good to work with and they seem to want to make it right."
4,Excellent Bike,"This is an excellent bike for the city. It's pretty fast and comfortable to drive. It's a little unbalanced, though, but I guess this could be fixed with a tuneup."
4,"Very light, and fast bike","Wow.. The bike can really move! I upgraded from a mountain bike to this road bike. Very impress with the looks, and the way it cranks!It looks like a high end bike that you can ride with confidence.A few minor upgrades would have made it a 5 star - The gear change is not the best position. The cable are hard to move around so you can add other things near the handles. The instruction booklet is horrible. So I did everything by myself. It's actually pretty easy.Just add the speedometer, and water cage, and you're ready to hit the road. I must have put up around 80 miles since then.I love it everyday."
5,More than I could have hoped for!!!,"After looking a various makes of road bikes for a few weeks. I found this gem. The guy at my local shop suggested this bike to ""get my feet wet"". I read all the reviews and decided why not, So I placed my order. It took 2 business days to arrive. I inspected the package for any damage that might have been caused by the delivery company (I learned this the hard way last time) I unwrapped the bike, assembly took all of 15 minutes, then it started raining. After 2 days of waiting I finally got to ride it. It did need a little tinkering to get the shifting ironed out but no biggie. Its every bit as good as some of the high dollar competition for what I was going to use it for. I don't plan on doing any racing on it. I just wanted a bike to ride to stay in shape. So all in all, it's more than I could have hoped for!"
4,Great Starter,"This is a great starter bike for anyone who wants to get into cycling. Please do research prior to buying to make sure this model will fit you. I am 5'10"" with a 30 inch inseam and this bike fits me perfectly. Great little bike that is lightweight.ProsAffordableLight weightSleekGreat starter BikeConsThe tires should be checked and pumped before each ride, i have lost as much as 30psi in one week. (think about purchasing a plug in pump to go with it that can pump to at least 125 psi)If you are not familiar with putting bikes together you should find a local bike mechanic to put it together."
4,Nice Bike!,"It was not that easy for me to ensanble, but it was ok. I think is a nice bike for entry level, I did not like the way they built the directions book."
1,Not what is advertised,"I returned our full order on these wrist pads because they were not gel-filled as listed, but memory foam filled. This is not what we wanted. Full credit was issued, so the company handled the return very well."
4,VERY NICE,This is a Very Nice Scope for a Great Price! Looks very nice on My Remington 700! I have no complaints
4,Decent,Purchased the 5-20X44 for long range visibility/shooting and it's is ok but it needs a bigger objective lens because it blacks out on higher powers & I wish it had 1/4in adjustment instead of 1/8in but still a lot of scope for the price.
2,Review of Monarch Riflescope,"Overall I am very disappointed with this scope. I thought I would save some money and not buy a more expensive Leupold like others I have. The BDC reticle on the Nikon Monarch is way too thick and takes up way too much of the field of view. When shooting at 100 yards, the reticle hides the bulls eye on the targets I use. Makes it difficult to get good groups or even sight the scope in. I have also found it difficult to focus the scope for different yardage. Lettering on the targets are blurry with the Nikon while crystal clear with a Leupold at 100 yards. To be fair, I have not tried the scope past 100 yards where it may do better but I don't have these issues with the Leupold's I own (even the cheaper ones). Again, to be fair the Leupold I am comparing to costs almost twice as much as I paid for the Nikon, but I wish I would have spent the extra money. I have talked to several people at the range who love their Nikon Monarch but I have not been impressed with mine."
4,Wii for little ones!,"I purchased this for my four year old, because he was feeling left out of all the Wii games we play. He was able to do a few games on his own on Wii Sports and Wario Ware Smooth Moves, but needed assistance most of the time. Not so with this game - I put it in and handed him the remote - he was off! The game is great, it has 3 difficulty levels and requires the kids to play a good variety of puzzle games. As they explore the spaceship, there are quite a few humorous movies that they can activate as well. I feel good about letting him play this on the weekend - he is really engaged and thinking, and I can see that it is definitely helping his fine motor skills as well. As long as parents are responsible, and limit the time their children spend playing video games, I think this is a great choice."
3,For the 3-5 set,"My 4 year old is generally reluctant to play the Wii with anyone else, as he doesn't feel comfortable. He'll noodle around with some games that his older brother (7) has mastered, but not with anyone else watching. This is the first game that I was invited to play with him. Yes, he mastered it in about 3 days, playing an hour or so a day, but he likes the mini-games and likes it when others ""play"" with him. This is a not a game with staying power, but we got it for $15 on sale, and it is probably worth that."
5,Great Book,"This Book has amazing photographs on every page, and delicious recipes. By far one of the best Elvis cook books I've ever purchased."
2,Elvis' Favorites?,Rather than Elvis' favorites the book actuallly admits that these are the kinds of foods folks in the south liked to eat so Elvis probably did too. A bit disappointing but I feel it still is a collectors item.
3,Pedestrian at best,"Very few recipes, very few pictures of Elvis, very much a slap-dash cobbled together effort. Nothing unique here other than the wedding cake."
1,Smelly!!!,"The book came straight from the nightclub, smelling and reeking of cigarettes. There is no way I could ever give such a thing to anyone I loved. I had to sit the item out on my patio due to it smelling up my house."
4,What is Worship?,"This book is written for both children and adults. In a humorous and touching way, this book helps us to understand that we sometimes get stuck in our own faith traditions rather than practicing the presence of God--where ever that may be..Illustrated well and can be used in small groups. Expect laughter..and smiles."
3,Not for me,"I couldn't finish reading the book. I found the emotional, non-detached language very disturbing. The continuous distinction of ""we normal people"" and ""they angry abusers"" didn't appeal to me. Also, it's not always obvious whether the author is giving advice to people who have anger problems themselves or to people who are dealing with an angry person, and I found it very distracting. The organization of the book (just a list of topics numbered from 1 to 102) didn't make it easier to read either."
4,Pretty Good,"I liked most of the stories in this book. Wife got it for me and thought it was all by King, but no worries as the others are good too."
2,Was hoping for more,"When I ordered Borderlands, I was anticipating a great collection of Horror short stories. What a got was an OK collection of a hodgepodge of short stories. Not surprisingly Stephen King steals the show with his contribution. I would only reccomned the book to someone wanting to read an ecliptic mix of stories from Authors, or die hard King fans that must have everything he writes."
3,Borderlands,"Most of the stories in this book are good. A few of them were just downright ridiculous and I skipped over them but, for the most part, this book is worth the read."
3,Want Something to Read Whilst in a Waiting Room?,This is an anthology of a number of short stories all of which deal with terror and madness.A nice book to have for planes and waiting rooms where you might get interrupted.
3,"Eh, so so","This was an ok read. A collection of short stories from various horror writers, I found most to be pretty good, but some I skipped through they just were boring. I would say the better half of the stories were decent though and I found a couple of new writers I may check out."
3,A mixed bag,"There are a few good stories, but overall, there's nothing new or genre-bending here, which is supposed to be what this collection is about."
3,"Not THAT weak, but not splatterpunk! Good spooky stories, no gore.","Not exactly what I expected, but still worth reading. Good stories but not super scary or splatterpunkish."
1,From The Borderlands,I hated this book. It was almost like the people that published the stories in this book where trying to hard to be different. The stories did'nt really make sense at all. The only good short story in this book was stationary bike.
3,I am keeping it,"I don't really like it. It does work well, but it looks kind of star trekish, and it is larger than I that or want it to be. It does however lock in to every shaker and glass on my bar. the little hook is nice for hanging. All in all it is a well designed strainer I just find the cosmetics leave something to be desired."
5,Excellent Quality,"A great bar strainer from WMF. It has a nice tight fit with my Boston shaker, the backplate is nice and thick and well constructed, and the handle is very comfortable and easy to use. Would definitely recommend!"
4,"A Fun, Intriguing Journey into the Reality Realm","This is a movie that I happened to stumble into. Knowing nothing about it other than what the jacket had to share (and when are those ever accurate!), I threw it into my DVD player and immediately became drawn into the story.This is a documentary where it's not so much a simple story about the ""reality"" show American Cannibal as it is everything else including our obsession with reality TV, how far people are willing to push their bounds for fame and fortune, and the insider side of the creation of television. It dares to explore themes like if people would be willing to eat each other (yes, literally) just for a shot at fame.It's witty, it's fun, and has an uncanny magnetic pull. Plus, it's really cheap (but not in production values nyuk nyuk nyuk). This is something to add to your collection."
3,Decent,"This CD is decent. It doesn't overly excite me but it inst bad either. A well rounded, decent disc."
4,Good book but very long,"I had to read two books for a school project. One that I picked was Homecoming. It took me a while to read with taking notes as well as reading it but after a few pages I couldn't put it down. Sometimes I forgot to take notes and had to go back and read certain parts over. But all and all, it was a really good book and I'd gladly read it again!"
2,Homecoming,"Honestly, I thought that this book was really boring. It didn't have too much suspence for me, and it had absolutely no interesing suprising parts to it. It was almost as if I could predict what was going to happen in the next chapter. I had to read it for school, but if I didn't have to, I wouldn't have read it. For starters, it would've been good, except for the fact that it was too long, and really stretched it out too much."
4,Homecoming,Homecoming is a good book!! this book shows what would really happens to young childern on there own!! it also shows that you should love your family and love people you never met and they can help you!! the book shows things may not turn out like you want it to but it comes out ok!! cuz even if you are alone there are still people out there in the world that can help you!! these childern go a long way and go through alot just to find a loved one and still try to stay together!! you should really read this book!! when i first looked at it i said we have to read ALL this!! but i'm glad i read it!! Homecoming i really worth you time reading cuz you always want to know what happens next to 4 childern walking miles and miles looking for there crazy mother but they get something better!! so i think you should read homecoming!!
2,Its Like Sleeping Pills,"At the start its good and i wanted to keep reading it but it got slow fast. It was draged out when they were walking. They could of talked to the cops and asked for a ride to any place they wanted or they could of found out were other peole from their were living. They had to walk insted, it took up atleast 100 pages. I think that if I drank 10 cups of coffe I would still fall asleep reading this book. And this book has one of the worst ending I have ever read. Read this book if you have a problem sleeping."
4,Homecoming,"Homecoming was an excellent book. It was filled with excitment on every page. My only only regrets are that during the middle of the book it became a little boring. But not for long, it comes back with even more excitment than before and has a wonderful ending! Other than that I loved the book! Dicey was my favorite character. She's so brave and she always has a plan. This book was adventurous from beggining to end, and I can't wait to read the sequel, Dicey's Song."
4,Absolutly amazing,"This book shows the ups and downs of a family that is forced to stick together and be there for one another. I recommend this book to any young teen, male or female. But to get the full story, I also recommend reading the sequels."
4,"Jennifer Barnwell's Interesting Review Over ""Homecoming""","In the book ""Homecoming""I thought it was a really interesting book. The way the way the children survived without their mother and only seven dollars really surprised me. I also thought it was interesting the the way they walked for days and didn't get caught by the police or social services. Each day after they got through walking the oldest child,Dicey, had to find a place for them to sleep. I think that was the biggest responsibility of all."
4,True Heroism,"This is the best example I have read of ""You do what you gotta do."" Some have said that a thirteen year old couldn't have done the things that Dicey did, but I believe that she certainly could. She had grown up taking care of James, Maybeth, and Sammy, so taking care of them on the road was not much different. Dicey did whatever she had to do to take care of them and get them to Aunt Cilla's. This was a fantastic, poignant book that I highly recommend."
3,LOST!,"The book Homecoming is about 4 children named Dicey (13), James (10), Maybeth (9), and Sammy (6). Their mom left them at a shopping mall in Peewauket with $11.00. Dicey was the oldest and the only relative they know was Aunt Cilla who lived in Bridgeport. (About 80 miles away) They had to get there some how.I thought this book was just okay, it was very hard to try to get into. You have to like this kind of book. It starts out slow at the begining of the story but eventually gets better."
4,Homecoming,"At a mere thirteen, Dicey Tillerman is left with her three younger siblings at a small shopping center when her mom vanishes within the crowd. Dicey, her brothers, and her sister are forced to travel hundreds of miles with the threat looming overhead of being broken apart by adoption. With the genuine goodness of strangers' hearts, the Tillerman family forges blindly across the northeast United States hoping to find a relative willing to support them with a home. The journey is filled with kind souls, well-intended promises, and dark corners. Though the plot is laced with tedious patched void of any excitement, it is one that everybody should read."
2,Homecoming- The Repetitive Adventure,"""Homecoming by Cynthia Voigt is a very adventurous novel about a loving family that is traveling around the United States trying to find a place to stay. This family of four goes by the name Tillerman. The mother of this family goes crazy and leaves her children, Dicey, James, Maybeth, and Sammy, to fend for themselves. The Tillerman's only chance of survival is to travel to their Aunt Cilla's dwelling. Will the Tillermans reach their destination?Overall, I thought ""Homecoming"" was a book full of ups and downs. It is very well written and full of great, descriptive words. The only aspect of the book that I did not like was the repetitiveness. In every chapter, Dicey and the rest of her family lose all their money and are starving. After a while, this gets annoying. My class stopped reading the book because of the repetitiveness and boringness."
5,"Excellent book, great for all level of readers","Many of my high school students are reading this book and really enjoying it, although it is not really a high school level book."
4,An Amaxing Book,"The Homecoming, by Cynthia Voigt, got a four star rating by me. I LOVED this book because it kept me coming back for more. I would always wonder what was going to happen next and where the Tillerman's would end up living. I LOVED that book so much, I'm going to start reading the sequal."
1,Homecoming: The Worst Book Ever!,"In ""Homecoming"" by Cynthia Voigt, four kids lose their mother and they have to fend for themselves. They try to get to their Aunt Cilla's house to see if their mom is there. Then they go all over the country trying to find their mom. They stay with two different relatives on their journey and meet some other people along the way.I Hated this book so much! It was so boring! The narrator went into to much detail with everything an i kept saying loud ""who gives a crap"" while I was reading. This book was so terrible and I do not recommend it for anyone at all. This book was so boring that my class stopped reading it. Do not read this book!"
4,What I Think About Homecoming,"I think homecoming is a good book. It is about four kids named dicey, Maybeth,James, and Sammy. Every cristmas their aunt cilla sends them a card, so they diced to go see her. When they where on thier way to Birgport thier mother wento the mall and told them tostay in the car while she go in.Then seh told James Maybeth and Sammy to obay Dicey and do what she says to do. They watied a long time and she never came back. So Dicey said lets start walking to Brigeport and maybe mom will be thier. days and days went by and they finly made it to thier Aunt cilla house. When they got thier they found out that thier Aunt cilla was dead and thiercousin unice stayed thier, also that thier mother was not thier. So days later they got tired of staying thier so thye decied to go see thier grandmother. They found out that thier grandmother was mean until they got tokonw her. But they now live with thier Grandmother."
3,"Needs to be up to date, but otherwise...","Well, I just think it was ok; average. I belive that it could have been better if it was more up to date. Anyways, the book was pretty good. I think that the whole plot was alright. The children get abandoned and need to go to their aunts house who is supposed to be rich but find a much larger surprize and go on an even biggger adventure than they think. These kinds of stories could be thought up of in a kid's mind. So overall, it was ok."
1,BOOOOOOOO!,"This book was a required summer reading book at my school, but I thought it was very boring. Maybelle is whiny and just plain annoying. The whole thing seems unreal, and if it was a movie, I would have fallen asleep in the first 5 minutes! It was just plain bad!"
1,repeditive and unbelievable,"I was required to read this book for school. First off, the descriptions of the charectors seem to be unrealistic. The first part of the book was them walking, for the most part. I got the point of their story within just a feww chapters of reading. And in the second part was more walking. I found it to be boring and i had trouble paying attention and being interested."
5,Every School Library Should Have The Tillerman Series,I enjoyed Homecoming ( 1 of 7 Tillerman series) and read it for the first time as an adult.The life lessons learned from this book don't just pertain to children. The Tillerman children and their grandmother teach everyone - child or adult - that life is sometimes hard and definitely not fair and that taking care of your own is vital and to never give up. These children walked miles with practically no money but fished and clammed and worked odd jobs along the way to feed themselves with the one goal to get to their grandmother.Every school library should have the entire Tillerman series.
4,Homecoming,This book was very confusing in the first few chapters but when I finally got deeper and deeper into the book I understood it more and more and the book turned out to be great! This book is about four kids and their mother. They were going to their Aunt Cilla's house in Bridgeport but instead they stopped. The mother goes in the mall leaving Dicey in charge and never comes out! Now they must live on their own with very little money and food. They decide to go to Bridgeport and on their way there they meet different people that help them along the way. But they have to overcome many problems on their own too.
2,The Review!,I thought this book was ok. It was so boring at some points of the book. Some parts were good because it was adventurous. I thought it was horrible at the middle though. It was so boring. At the end it got more exciting because there was a lot of suspense. I would not reccomend this book to some people.
1,Can you say BORING??,"The first ten chapters took me so long to read because I kept falling asleep. Nobody in their right mind will read a book just to read what people are saying to each other. But, that is all this book is, Dicey talking to her brothers and sister. This is the worst book I 've ever read."
1,Homecoming,"I think that Homecoming was a bad book. It was about a mother who goes crazy, and can't take care of her kids, so she abandons them in her car in a mall parking lot. Then the kids have to walk the rest of the way to Bridgeport to get to their aunt Cilla's but when they get there she had died and her daughter Eunice wants to take the kids in but then she just wants to put them in foster homes. So then they leave and go to Crisfield to find their grandmother that they have never met before. The ending was pretty bad because nothing cool or funny or scary happened."
1,"Undoubtedly, one of the most boring books I have ever read.","Reading Cynthia Voight's ""Homecoming"" is like watching a bad sitcom; it realizes that it's going nowhere and figures that if it throws in some new characters and situations from left field, it will somehow make it better. It starts out with the abandonment of a mother and the first 1,000 pages rattle on about the kids walking down the road, the next 50 million try to describe some bond between the kids and a college student, and when the book finally seems to end- it spends the last 6 trillion pages talking about Gracie's realtionship with her grandmother.There really isn't anything to be learned from this book other than the fact that whenever the action gets slow, have the protagonist take off her clothes."
2,A book on a mother who leaves her four children in a car.,"The book was not catchy in the beginning, but it soon began to pick up the pace on what it really was about. On this book I wasn't really interested and didn't get my attention."
3,IT ISN'T THE MOST EXCITING BOOK,"This book to me was kind of boring. I gave 3 stars because it had some pretty good areas in it and in some places interesting. I honestly didn't like it much. A family travels all over the Eastern seaboard in search of a family after their mother deserts them, and that is pretty much it."
5,Outrageous Book!,"This is a book that touched me. It was truly uplifting. I felt that I, myself, was deserted when Dicey, Sammy, Maybeth and James were deserted by their mother.This book was sad and happy in a twisted way. The way I mean is, I was happy they didn't have to live with their mother and have such wretched lives.I grade this book five stars."
5,"The best book I have ever read, one of my favorites!","After reading this book many times, you understand the book more and more. It is one of my favorite books, but I strongly suggest that you read the other books in the series because it becomes more vivid and easier to understand."
4,A Good Book,"I read this book and think it is really good. It is quite long, but I read it in no time and could not keep it down. I greatly recommend this book!"
2,Homecoming,"I would give the book Homecoming two stars as it dragged out. I think it dragged out because it tells about each day they are alone and almost the same thing happens every day. It is about four kids abanoned in a car. They have no mom, no dad and they don't know any relative execpt for their Great Aunt Cilla. They have to deal with many choices on their way like who to stay with, who should they trust, and what should they buy."
4,Homecoming,"I thought this was a very good book. When I read it, I thought that I was like Dicey, always burdened with all those responsibilities to take care of James, who is twelve, Maybeth, who is nine, and Sammy, who is six. I thought the book was excellent, except for the fact that the traveling dragged on through the chapters. If Voigt could find a way to make the traveling half of the book a little shorter/ quicker I then would gladly give it five stars. I would say that this book could be read by anyone who enjoys a good book for what it is worth, not for it's length. I would reccomend the rest of the Tillerman series too. I have read it all and I had enjoyed it a lot more than the first book, Homecoming."
4,Homecoming,"This book was assigned to me by my reading teacher. Not being an avid reader I was very closed minded to reading a book this long, but I was amazed at how fast I read it. The book is about a girl and her siblings who are abandoned by their mother. The 13 year old, Dicey, faces many challenges in the search for a loving home to become part of. This book trully made me grateful for what I have. I enjoyed it very much, and would highly recomend it."
5,You won't be able to put it down!,"Dicey is a truly amazing character. Cynthia Voight does a great job of making you feel like you're their, and that Dicey really exists. Her siblings each have distinctive personalities also. This isn't just about her going to find a home and taking care of her sister and brothers(which is a lot) this book shows love and integrity without actually telling you a moral. I recommend that all avid readers take a look at this!"
5,A wonderful book for young and old,I really enjoyed this book. I think that it was uplifting and i think that it was very interesting. I am ready to read the other books written by Cynthia Voigt.
3,Homecoming,"I rated Homecoming three stars because at times it was a real cliff-hanger but at other times it was repeating a lot of the same stuff. This book is about a mother who left her four children in a car alone at the mall parking lot. The oldest is Dicey-13, James-10, Maybeth-9 and Sammy-6. Now it is up to them to try and find food and a place to stay."
3,Homecoming,"Homecoming a great book! The author wrote the book as a cliff hanger, so you wanted to keep reading.I never wanted to put the book down! Some parts of the book got really boring, but then it got better and better. This book made me think about how lucky I am to have parents who would never do what Dicey's mom and dad did to her!"
1,Uhhhh!,Why are we forced to read some of the most boring books in the world!?! Here's the setup. A mother abandons her children in a car so the children decide to go from Rhode Island to Conneticutt(or is it the other way around?) Sounds interesting right? Well it isn't. Most of the time the book's talking about their walk to their destination. My opinion is that this is a bad book.
1,I was forced to read this piece of [...],"I absolutely despise this book. I probably would nver have read it, but I was forced to do to an upcoming reading compition. It is so repitious that you can barely tell the difference from one chapter to another. Practicly the whole story is about some kids walking and trying to find food. Sounds exciting doesn't. Please same yourself some time and money and dont even pick up this awefull book. [I'm sorry for any spelling mistakes]"
1,Homecoming,"In the book Homecoming by Cythia Voigt, four children are left stranded by their mothers. They have a crazy mother who leaves them in a car, and winds up in a mental institution. The kids are left to fend for themselves. Dicey at only age 13 has to become the mother figure for the other three youngsters. The end up finding some family to stay with for a short time.All in all, this book wasn't as good as I was expecting.. I thought that it went to far into detail, and when the should have ran out of money they never did. I do not recommend this book because I believe that is was poorly written. My class stopped reading it because everyone disliked it. So for your own good and time, DO NOT READ!(:"
3,Reveiw of Homecoming,Homecoming is an okay book. It is okay because it dosn't have much action or drama. It has good parts and bad parts. It is a big book.
3,What i think,"I rated it a 3 because its pretty good. The first part is very boring. When you get to the second part it gets exciting. I think if you like to start off slow and then get moving, this is the book for you. If you like books you can read with your family this book will work."
4,Getting Close To home.,"The book Homecoming is a really good book. It's about four kids who get abandoned by their mother at a big mall. They were on their way to their {rich}Aunt Cilla's house that is by the ocean in Bridgeport, CT. They only have $11.00 and a long way to go. Also food is a BIG problem! When they get to Bridgeport they find out that her house is not by the ocean, she is not rich, and she is not even alive! So they are stuck with Aunt Cilla's daughter. They call her Cousin Eunice. Soon Dicey (the 13 year old and oldest) thinks that they can`t stay because the youngest kid (Sammy) keeps getting in trouble. So soon they find out that they have a Grandma who lives in Crisfeild, MD. So now there are three problems. How are they going to get there? Plus is their grandma going to like them and let them stay? If not ,will Cousin Eunice take them back? If you really what to know ,read the book ""Homecoming."" I hope you like the book!"
5,An unforgetable book!!!...,"Homecoming is a book I would want you to read because it's a good book and because it has a lot of adventure. It is about Dicey, Maybeth,James,and Sammy. Their mother leaves them in the car all alone so Dicey,James,Sammy,and Maybeth set off and they only have $11.00 and they spent $4.00 the first night and set off in to the night all alone from the car by the mall. There are some nice people and some bad people the nice people help them and some of the nice people are Will and Claire. You should read this book."
3,Far From Home,"The book HOMECOMING wasn't the best book I ever read, but it wasn't the worst. If you don't know, it's about four children, their mother left them and they are ""far from home."" The oldest is Dicey. Her siblings are James, Maybeth,children, and last, but not least there is Sammy. In the story, they try to find their way through many obstacles. There are also many helpful people.I liked the book in some ways, and disliked the book in some ways. At some parts of the book I just wanted to keep on reading. At other parts, I fall asleep. I also liked the people they meet. I have one favorite . Grandma, she has a lot of ambition, and, like Dicey she is very determind.As you read, I liked the book in some parts and I realy didn't in others."
3,ALL ALONE!,"The book was about kids (ages 13,10,8,6,) were left alone in the car, at a mall and their mom NEVER CAME BACK! I don't know why she would do such a thing! So they had to travel to where they were going by themselves. It was a VERY GOOD BOOK even though it is VERY LONG it is still good. It could come in handy if you ever had to survive alone. It was a GOOD BOOK but at the same time it kind of got boring. But I still think that if you read this book you will LOVE IT!"
2,This book is rendundant,"The book would be perfect if it wasn't so redundant. The whole first part, is about four abandoned children walking, literally. The only thing the first part has to make it worth not skipping, is the fact that they meet different people who help them. The second part is a little bit redundant. The second part is also more exciting. This book wasn't really my style, but if you like walking, then pick this up."
4,AWESOME BOOKS homecoming!,I liked this book. It was very well writen and I really enjoyed reading it. I didn't get to the end yet but I don't think the mother will come back. All I have read p to is where they are sitting at the table in their grandmothers house and they are eating for the first time in a while. I like how Cynthia Voiut p0ut the book together and kept the book suspenceful. This was a very good book and I really enjoyed it.
4,On the end of our seat book.,Homecoming is about four kids whoose mother has abandon them at a shopping mall in a strange town. With only 11$ in there pocket they head off to there grandmother's house in Bridgport. When they get to Bridgeport they find out that there grandmother is dead and they meet there cousin Eurnice.

Well they don't got enough money to go the whole way so they have to walk part of the way. When they get to there grandmothers house they find that there grandmother is a person who tends to her self and no one less. Well to find out who dicey and her brothers and sister saty with......Your gonna have to read the book. This book was really good and I recommend it to anyone in middle school or higher.
4,The long and winding road...,"They say the American novel was born with ""Huck Finn,"" the quintessential American experience of travel and personal discovery. We see it in everything from the beatniks ""On the Road"" to the acid heads ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" to pop movies like ""Pulp Fiction""* to youth fiction here. Ms. Voight does not disappoint in this book about four plucky kids cast in a difficult circumstance making their way across five or six states to find the most important thing of all: home. A well-drawn cast of main and supporting characters make this a pleasure to read and an inspiration.* JULES: That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.VINCENT: What do you mean, walk the earth?JULES: You know, like Caine in ""KUNG FU."" Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.VINCENT: How long do you intend to walk the earth?JULES: Until God puts me where he want me to be."
3,It's still true..,"This book is full of adventure, and all of the adventures that the Tillerman children have been on. It's fun to read and makes you feel as if you were there with the Tillermans emarking on their next adventure!"
4,Coming home,"If you were a mother with no husband to provide for your children and could not pay rent anymore because you were fired from a job, what would you do? the Tillermans mother decided to abandon her children with nothing but a map and eleven dollars. this is the start of the novel Homeconing by Chyntia Voight. These kids have to find out how to get to their aunts house by foot. As they struggle to pass by miles and miles of road, walking in any condition rain or shine just to avoid being orphans and living with other abandon children. Do you think the Tillerman children would be able to survive mentaly and phicically? Theres only one way to find out. I think this book was great and very interesting because most of the book I have read in the begining are boring causing me to close the book but this book from the begining I was asking all of these questions. I would recomend this book to people of all ages."
5,Words fail,"Homecoming is the start of a series that chronicles the world of a girl named Dicey. It's a story that you sink into and can't escape. By the time it's over, you may need a day or two to emotionally recover yourself.Some readers may have some difficulty with it, as Voight tends to narrow in on small details. That only makes the story longer, but it also makes for a more breathable world. Voight's an exceptional writer."
5,Couldn't stop Listening!,"I listened, rather than read, this book. This is not something I do often with fiction, but I enjoyed it enormously. My 12 year old daughter read Dicey's Song in class in the Fall, and I had not read that along with her so I was thrilled when a friend loaned me the tapes she had borrowed from the library! What a story! Written in a style that evokes the physical locations the children visit. Makes me wonder what adults must be thinking -- where was the help these children needed. In the end, of course, Dicey's (the oldest's child's) instincts are correct and they end up where, I believe, they belonged all along. They would certainly not have arrived there with adult intervention -- only love guided them to their final destination. Love of family, love on one another. Love triumphs over all in the end."
5,This is an excellent book!,"Every summer I read this book and each year the knowledge I gain has helped me further understand the struggles this family has gone through. Homecoming is a truly wonderful book that teaches you are home when there is a family and love. I have often imagined what it would have been like to live through the hardships they have. From the beginning when their mother abandons them, my heart went out to the Tillerman family. Their journey takes them to a home where they have truly found happiness. I advise you all to read this book!!"
3,I liked the book but the ending kind of left me hanging.,"I beleive that this is a very good book, but I do not think that it deserves 5 stars because of more than one reason. One being that the ending was kind of abrupt and the other was that there was no real tragedy in the end as I would have hoped for so thats why I give it 3 out of 5 stars. But I intend on reading the sequal."
4,Critics from an eighth grade classroom,"An enjoyable book with fasinating characters, two lovable boys, and two breath taking girls. Adventures in the woods or on the road; Dicey, Sammy, James and Maybeth can take you there. For a family, a student, or teacher-it's a great book. mc,ab,ccFour children are abandoned by their mother. They walk for days to their aunt's house and live with their cousin. Soon they leave for their grandmothers's house. They want to live there, but their grandma doesn't want them. They have no where to go. llk"
5,Excellent,"Cynthia Voight is my favourite author. I love all her books.My favourite character is Sammy he is so innocent.I recommend reading ""When She Hollers"" also by CynthiaVoigh"
4,Nikki's review,"I liked this book because the author gave very good descriptions. For instance, The town of Crisfield lay in the sunlight before them, bleached white as the oyster shells scattered on the ground. Also I liked the ending, and how it was a little suspenseful.This book is about four kids whose mom abandoned them. Dicey, the oldest of the children, have to get them to Bridgeport. It is a long ways to walk and they barely have any money. Their first stop was to their cousin Eunice's house. There, their cousin was very mean to them, so they didn't stay for long, she kept saying that Maybeth and Sammy were retarded. Next, with the money Dicey worked for, the kid's took a bus to Crisfield There they were going to meet their grandma. They had never met her, and also heard rumors saying that she was crazy.Will their grandma take them in? Or will they continue to travel? Will they ever find their mom?I think anyone that likes adventure stories will like this book. And suspense."
3,Homecoming,Homecoming is a novel about family and survival. It's about four kids who get abandoned by their mother in a mall parking lot. They are trying to find her. they travel by foot to their Aunt Cilla's house. Little do they know that their Aunt Cilla died two years back. This book is good. I do recommend reading this novel. There is a lot of detail almost too much! but otherwise it has a great story line!
