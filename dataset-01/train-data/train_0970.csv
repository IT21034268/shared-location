4,Eco-Drive Canvas Strap Watch,Very nice watch with beautiful detail. The band is small compared to the watch face. Overall the watch is a great deal for the price!
4,band is tiny,"Every feature of this is great, except that the wristband is tiny. My wrists are not very thick at all, but I can only get the buckle to the second hole, and that's pretty tight. Be prepared to get a bigger band."
4,"Great watch, terrible band","I bought this watch about a month ago and I love it. It's professional looking, doesn't need a battery, and keeps good time. The band, however, is itchy and looks like poverty. I replaced it with a $10 leather band from Walmart and it looks and feels much better. I fully recommend the watch."
2,Not the best choice...,"1. I recently purchased this watch for an upcoming trip, where I would need something reliable and dependable, but nothing fancy. The watch arrived a couple days before my departure, and I was immediately disappointed with the band. For a men's watch, this is a very flimsy, feminine looking band.2. Band was changed for black rubber, then I realized the date/calendar function was no longer working. On checking the website, there are some special instructions for setting this function. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE, as they are not like standard watches and failure to follow WILL result in damage to the watch.3. This watch is apparently so cheaply built Citizen doesn't even stamp the back of the case with mfg information, but just applies a sticker. A STICKER?!?! Come on, even Timex stamps the case backs.I have been buying Tissot watches in the past, with great results, but wanted to try Citizen this time. My mistake. Back to Tissot for me!"
1,"Dates are in Spanish, instructions are wrong, back it goes","Perhaps I got a model not intended, but it's never happened before.What I received has the days in the wrong language, and even if they are in English, the process of setting the date and the day is unnecessarily cumbersome. The date, for example, can only be incremented up, but it's on the same control as the day. So if you go to change the day, or accidentally twist when you think you're changing the time, you have to scroll through 31 days and start over.Given that you must manually change the date every month, that's too much hassle for a watch designed to be super easy."
2,NOT FOR ME,"I purchased this Eco-Drive and was disappointed. The face was too small and cluttered, and the day/date were barely readable. I decided to upgrade to the BM640000E, and couldn't be happier."
2,Not So Great,"There were three things wrong with the watch when received - 1.Second hand moved in 2-second increments rather than one second movements, giving 5 beats during 10 seconds. 2.Second hand did not register correctly on the second markers. 3.Could not set the day of the week on the day/date calendar. May have been a bad watch(quality control?). Plan on replacing the band. I really wanted it to work, but returned for credit and will try another brand."
1,I am Disappoiment,"Today I received the watch ""Citizen Men's BM8180-03E Eco-Drive Canvas Strap"" , but this is not the one I bought. I feel deceived because the picture show that measures is about 4.5 centimeters and this only measures 4 cms. In addition the back plate look like an ""engraving"" with word ""Japan"", and this only has a sticker! so I say you sent to me a imitation(maquila)not an original Citizent watch like you show in your webside... Amazon that's so bad of you!"
3,DAINTY,"A little smaller than expected. Although there are plenty of pictures here to help one decide, it's hard to capture how small, thin and light it is on a normal sized wrist. I actually have a thin wrist and it still looked small on mine. I was scared to hit it on something and break it.The size of it all makes the holes on the band look bigger by comparison and kinda fad-ish. LIke something a teenage girl would wear.Can't speak for the performance, only the way it looks once it's on your wrist. Returned it and got a swiss army garrison watch that seems to be a beter fit and built sturdier."
4,Citizen Eco Drive,"I love the fact that this watch will never need a new battery because it's solar powered. The wristband is sturdy, made from canvas with grommets for the different positions of the clasp. The reason that my rating lost two stars is because the glowing numbers and hands are often too faint at night to read unless I shine a bright light on them first. Then they will stay lit for several hours, but not the whole night. Second, the crown has two positions that are hard to find, making changing the date tricky. Overall,a good price and I would recommend this purchase.Update: I believe I have been too critical of the luminescent numbers. Recently I was able to read my watch at 5:30 AM without any special charging. It was not overly bright, but it was possible to read. I am returning one star."
4,pretty good,got the watch in 3 days. it is quite refined and of high quality. the only prolbem is that the setting of date/day is not that straight forward.
4,4 years old,"I've worn this watch every day for 4 years. Perfect time and no waking up in morning to a dead watch and finding time during day to get a battery.It seems like I always got an old battery for my dress watch and it was dead in 6 months.No more. I have this watch and another dress watch,both ECO-Drive.The correct time every time I put it on. I'm very happy.Like everyone says,a upgrade in watchband is necessary but well worth it."
5,A Must for your Watch Wardrobe,This is the best buy in timepieces for the money. It has an easy to read face; it is DAY DATE as opposed to just day of the month; it is rugged; it needs no battery; it is deadly accurate. I have two of them!
4,If only it was larger ...,"I've owned this watch for over a month or so. I don't know how much I can add to the other reviews; it's a good-looking, great-working timepiece. It's surprisingly well-built, with a simple, easy to read fliegler-style dial. The canvas-style band seems thin and flimsy but durable, if there can be such a thing.I'm not the kind of person who believes ""bigger is better"" when it comes to watches, considering anything smaller than an Invicta Magnum XXL Deathforce Russian Diver Xtreme 70mm as tiny and emasculating. However, at 37mm, this watch is quite small by today's standards. I've got a middling 7"" wrist, and the BM8180 fits like the Timex I owned in eighth grade. I doubt North Americans and Europeans are the target audience for this watch, but rather Japanese teenagers.I don't know where this watch will fit into my rotation. A bit larger, like 40 or 41mm, and I'd be wearing it on a regular basis during the weekend or after work."
5,An amazingly elegant and long-lasting watch!,"My girlfriend (now wife) gifted this watch to me in mid 2004. Since then I've used it on and off. In between, I did not wear it for about 1.5 years and last year when I brought it out of its hiding place it was not running. Amazingly, after half a day of sunlight it was running again. Before and after, it has always been pretty accurate for past 5.5 years!It is a very simple yet a very elegant looking watch which matches with most of the clothing - outdoor, casual and even business casuals. And it's Green!!!"
4,A Good Watch,This is a good looking watch. It gains about 2 seconds per week which is good for a low priced quartz watch. I like the green canvas band with leather lining. The watch band is almost too short. Someone with a large wrist will find they will have to replace it with a longer band. If it came with a longer band I would have given it 5 stars.
1,Don't Buy This Watch,I had the same trouble others seem to be having. Day and date function stopped within hours of wearing it for the first time. Crown already seems loose. I'm returning it for something else.
5,Perfect for what it does.,"This watch is fairly small and simple. If you are looking for a watch that is tough, simple, and a high quality timepiece. This one is worth a look. I have owned several Citizen watches and have been happy with all of them, this one is no exception."
5,Citizens Men's BM8180-03E,"Best price. Fast service. As advertised. Light source keeps battery charged: No need to wear to keep it running, unlike Seiko Kinetic which stops after several days if not charged by motion."
4,Classic Look,This watch is great. I don't have to worry about regular battery replacements as it is powered by light. The watchband that comes with it is not so attractive so I purchased another that matches. It was pretty easy to change out. The watch face is small enough for my small female wrist but a little thick and can get caught on sleeves. This is probably from all the internals that are needed to grab the light and store it. I love the style of the watch face. Simple military classic look. Great watch for the money.
4,Love everything except strap,"I must say when the watch arrived I was pleasantly surprised by it. The watch looks much more elegant than the pictures make you believe. I'm 5'7"" medium build and the watch fits just right on my wrist. If you're looking for a flashy watch with a big face look elsewhere. This is more of a simple everyday watch that you can rough it with and not get too disappointed if it gets damaged. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is the strap. It is well made but I just have a problem with the color choice and material. It's not very comfortable on the wrist and I have been fussing with it a lot. I plan to stick with it for a few months then swap the strap out for something black with all leather or a rubber."
4,"VERY RELIABLE ,EASY TO READ ,",I LIKE THIS WATCH BECAUSE EASY TO READ THE TIME WITH DATE N DAY AND GIVES A RELIABLE CORRECT TIME /DAY N DATE AND I TRUSTED CITIZEN BRAND IS QUALITY.THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IT IS NOT LUMINOUS AT NIGHT/DARK ENVIRONMENT.......YOU CANT SEE /READ THE TIME
3,Rusted out....,"I had bought this watch at a local jewelry store on sale. After 2 years of excellent service it suddenly stopped working and then started up again. When I went to set the time the stem came off in my hand( The one thing not covered in the warranty.) It turns out that the inside of the watch had rusted out and I have never emerced the watch in water. I wasn't totally surprised that this happened. Sometime before a person I knew had seen me wearing the watch and warned me that Citizen watches like this will rust out. The so-called 5 year warranty is a joke. I had $20 watches with better warranties. Sure I could have sent it in to be ""inspected"" every so many months, but a watch should be used not in the shop like some overpriced sportscar all the time. Its not like it was a $30000 or more Rolex. Its a real shame because I really liked this watch."
5,Works Great,Nice watch good price works fine for me. Like the idea of no battery. Band OK not a deal breaker
4,Love my Citizen Eco-Drive Men's Canvas Strap Watch,"I'm pleased with my purchase of the Citizen Eco-Drive Men's Canvas Strap Watch. I found, to my pleasure, that the watch was what I had hoped it would be: Good size, easy read, clean design w/o unfuctional clutter as seen with other watch designs, keeps great time, the only thing that would merit a better review would be a sporty rubber type band."
4,A great watch for its price,"Bought it for hubby as an alternative for daily use (his previous one is a bit too formal). It's not dressy yet still nice for everyday occasions. It has the Citizen Eco-Drive technology therefore we won't need to worry about changing battery for a very long time. The one feature hubby loves is the watch illuminates in the dark.However, there are two things that bothers me: the watch is a bit too thick for a person with relatively small wrist, and the strap began to smell after just one month of use.Overall, it's a great watch for its price."
4,Watch band,This watch band is as advertised. It seems to be well made. I use it during the winter and a resin band during the summer.
5,Excellent value and great watch,"Great watch; has gained 1/2 second in two weeks -- certainly acceptable for price paid, and never needs batteries. Watch and band are fine on my smaller-than-normal wrist. Band is fine for a sporty, informal look -- olive drab color and well made. Definitely recommended for an everyday watch."
3,little disappointed,"It is a nice watch. I had to have 2 links removed so it would fit my wrist. I am slightly disappointed, as the face of the watch is larger than I anticipated (or wanted). Another review compared it to the size of a quarter and it is definitely larger than a quarter."
1,Bad quality control,"I order twice for the same product as a gift to my boyfriend and it bought us a lot of troubles. The first time we receive the product, the hand of the watch does not point exactly to the seconds, it is half way between each second. Besides, when we try to adjust the day,i.e Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the adjustment button will not turn and stuck on Wednesday. We returned the item and I order it again as a gift to send it to my boyfriend office. The package does not come with the gift message as it promised and this time the watch strip is defective. It produce a click, click sound when you try to put the watch over the wrist. I thought citizen is a named brand with good quality control and it turns out not."
2,poor quality,The quality is terrible. I've tried two of this model. The first one failed on the next day after arrival--the date/weekday wheels can no longer rotate. Amazon replaced it for free. But the same problem appeared in a few months. I had to let it sleep on my desk for several weeks until recently it fell off and the fragile glass cover broke into pieces.
5,bought in 2009,"I bought this watch in 2009 from Amazon and its probably left my wrist for no more than a month in that time frame except for when I purchased one for my girlfriend when we had to spend time apart, and she decided she'd rather wear mine than have a new one of her own. So now I wear the new one. Its obviously not very flashy and at this point, the watch shows some wear as scratches. I'm a healthcare professional, as is she and I wash my hands with the leather/canvas band a lot. On top of that were avid hikers and I'm a mountain biker. The watch goes everywhere I go and I don't find the band smelly at all. Maybe a little if you get down right close to it but why would you? I find that it keeps great time. Every few months i'll notice its a minute or two different from my phone and I'll change the time. I really couldn't be happier with this watch."
3,A bit of a letdown.,"I liked the look of the watch. I have owned a citizen watch in the past and had no problems with it. I enjoy the styling of the watch.The strap is in no way comfortable and the grommets on the leather-backed canvas strap make it hard for me to get a nice fit. I will likely replace the strap, which is unfortunate.Also, as others have said, the second hand does not line up with the second/minute marks on the watch face. Not a huge deal, but it would seem to denote a lack of attention to detail on Citizens behalf."
4,Better than Stuart Reid,"Although certain flawed presumptions are made, spelling mistakes are present and there are other minor errors, on balance this is a good resource.Unlike Stuart Reid's anti-Highland hyperbole, there is a genuine attempt at objectivity here. Well worth the money."
2,Can't stand the heat,"Product worked well for intended use, except didn't hold up under medium high grill temps. Only had on grill for 10 - 12 minutes and sheet burned and warped. Only good for one use. I haven't used but once. may work better at low temps, but I don't usually grill this way."
3,just fine,"The grill was shipped just fine but youerrored on a book purchase. You didn'tsend the selected order at all.You cajoled me into ordering some otherbooks to actuate a 'Fast' shippment. Thatdidn't happen either. The deliverys werenot UPS but private persons!!!My girfriends brthday present was neverdelivered and the two, you 'pressed' onme were a week too late. GOOD.I order a book by Arthur Schlesinger called,Age of Jackson. It was never delivered.You acknowledged my ordering it, on screen.WELL ...??Were is itYeah,thankscraig"
4,Don't ever clean your grill again!,"We never grill without these sheets. They're quick, easy and keeps your grill SO clean! These thin but sturdy sheets allow for all of the heat to get through and non of the mess. And you can use both sides! I highly recommend these sheets."
3,Practical/useful grill accessory - not sure of cost effectiveness,"These aluminum sheets are a good way to grill messy foods or foods with sugary/sticky marinades. I found it rather hard to clean the flexible BBQ Grill Topper for a 2nd use, so I am not sure how many second uses I'll get from each sheet. That's why I am ambivalent about the cost effectivess of using this product on a regular basis. But it it is great for grilling certain items. I have used a single-use non-stick aluminum BBQ sheet from Reynolds that was really good, but it is no longer being manufactured."
2,No Bargain,"This is no bargain to purchase on Amazon.Buy something similar at your local supermarket/check infomercials/etc.Also...it is not 10 sheets - it arrived as 6 sheets, and they are not re-usable, unless you don't care about bacteria, health and other food related issues. This is truly the first time I felt misled by Amazon - but summer is too short for me to return and deal with all that annoyance.Too much money...for too little product! Buyer Beware!"
1,Ruined My Grill!,This product melted to my grill and burner plates. We had the grill on medium-high heat and it melted to the cooking surface. It was our first time using it.Terrible product! Do not buy!
5,REALLY REALLY GOOD!,"Tis albums great, i just got it yesterday and its fabulous. Its got 3 songs with only eminem, however he is in almost every other. The 3 songs with eminem are all probably his best work:Looseyourself8mileRun Rabbit RunPlus i think the best song is Adreline Rush, Obie trice is also in alot of ghis songs. Not alot of Dre. If you like dre still buy it though. And if you dont well STILL BUY IT! Its real good. 5tars man!"
3,Partial Credit,"Some songs are this album are very good. Im pretty sure most people bought the album for either Lose Yourself or Wanksta. But other songs by Obie Trice aand ""Places To GO"" are all pretty good. But as the CD moves on 2 track 7 or 8, the CD really goes downfall, Songs by NAs, JAy-Z, MAcy Gray, RAkim, etc. really dont stand out as much as the first couple tracks do. The CD has great production, the 1st half of the CD is *****, but the second deserves only * or **."
4,different styles make it dope,"Pretty deep record, with top notch rappers and even better beats. Sure, Em is here, but so is the rest of the gang. D-12, Jay Z, Obie Trice, blah blah etc etc. Oh yeah, 50 cent. The songs are tight for the most part, although Obie could stand to learn some new profanity. The F word gets old, ya herd?"
5,The Soundtrack of Soundtracks,"If you never own another soundtrack besides 8 Mile, than it don't matter. This is it. The movie was aiight, Em can't act, but muzik... WOW! He pulls out all the stops and gets a bunch of his boyz together to put together a worth wile album. Obie Trice is hot on a few tracks, but 50 Cent is where it's at here. ""Wansta"" is a killer track, but you should already know that. Shady lights it up on ""Loose Yourself"", but my favorite Shady-tune, is ""Rabbit Run"". X-to-the-Z put out another heavy beat with ""Spitshine"" - lyrics like ""Fight the good fight, don't need no help; Keep your hands up, defend yo self"", man I just wanna fight ya'll.Eminem is where the rap world is right now, good things follow him, and this is no exception. Don't be cheap, get this album."
3,Could Have Been Better...,"Yeah..the lead single ""Lose Yourself"" by Slim Shady was off the hook but that was the only stand-out track on the album. This should have been a classic release with mc's such as Rakim, Nas and Jay-Z on it..They are all possibly top 5. There were several good songs but overall....just an average soundtrack to an average movie...don't believe the hype.."
2,Rakim and Gangstarr only reason to peep this trash heap,"Alright, so 50 Cent and Em are the most popular MCees in hip hop. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY ARE GOOD. This album [reeks]. Except for Gangstarr and Rakim's appearances, this is a complete waste of time. ""Lose Yourself"" is up their with Eminem's worst, like his irritating song about his mom, ""Cleaning out my Closet"". I wish the hip hop nation would wake up and realize how wack eminem and 50 are."
3,"Eminem is sweet, the rest is a waste","The Eminem songs on this CD are good but the rest are not near as good. The only time I ever put this in my system is when I want to hear some other Eminem stuff, I listen to the sampler it came with more than the soundtrack itself. Don't get me wrong, Eminem's tracks are tight but the rest leaves you wanting more M."
3,8Mile,"This was a decent soundtrack. It wasn't as good as I expected, but it certainly wasn't bad. My favorite song is definitely 'R.A.K.I.M.' ... His flow is INSANE.It really isn't a bad soundtrack, but something is just...lacking."
2,rapper to movie star to exec does not a soundtrack make,"Eminem stars in the new movie 8 Mile under the direction of critically acclaimed director Curtis Hanson. Now only if the soundtrack was under the direction of a professional music executive. Instead we are given shameless filler promotion of Shady Records [with or without the promotion, the artists on it are likely to ""Sell half"" anyway, so why bother? Why not put some good rap music in? Old school songs that may have inspired Em? For rap and hip hop fans, Obie Trice has to be one of the worst debut rappers since, well...Bizarre. The production value is fair, and that's saying alot. The album doesn't much follow the movie [as Eminem had promised], and besides the lead single, there isn't much to look forward to. Hell, there's even a Macy Gray song [what was Em thinking?!] and a Boomkat [who???] song to fill up the rest of this lackluster. Burn it from the internet. Then tell me if it's ""hot""."
5,Best Soundtrack Ever,"I never thought i would hear such a great soundtrack. Maybe it is because i am a rap fan but this was just so great.Eminem wasn't the only one who shone on this album.50 and Trice broyught it along with Nas and Xzibit. Every beat was tight.""Love Me"" was kind of a haunting slow beat but was still dope."
4,8 mile Soundtrack,"The album is pretty good. Got some great stuff, and then got some bad stuff, but mostly good. This cd is definently worth your money, though."
4,Solid soundtrack,"Good music here. I still get chills in the song 'Rap Game' when 50 does the chorus....He sounds so tight in that song. Oh, and 'Places to Go' is my favorite song by 50 Cent, it fits his voice perfectly."
4,Lose Free with Eminem!,"I haven't got a chance to see the Movie 8 Mile but sure picked up cool the soundtracks as 8 Mile had been my fav'. Gradually, hearing Lose Yourself, Run Rabbit, 8 Miles & running Jay Z, Battle, Places to go - Eminem is a 'Rare' Choice Pick. Eminem has 'hardcore lyrics' and the words spill out emotions, experiences with the harmonious music beats in the background. 'Eminem's this pick is 'Lose Yourself Free' - grabbing opportunity, rap, hip hop and freak free to 'Whack, scrap' yet enjoy the stuff - cool Rap! My choice 'Eminem' They're the Best Rappers, no Wonder! Good Pick."
4,A Banga,"It might not be a hood classic but this will be one of the many collaborations that will be remebered. Eminem really shines on the mainstream track ""lose Yourself"". This is one of many cd's that you should add to your collection. Especially with the banga ""wanksta"" by 50 cent and the new york king jay z's "" 8 miles and running"" feat beans. Cop this joint or you will be missing out on a tyte cd fa sho."
4,The movie was awesome and now the sound track is awesome,"aight this cd is awesome if you like eminem get this cd and if you like the movie get this cd. In my opinon ""lose your self"" is the best song on hurr. Of course it is the theme song. BUY this cd its great one of the best soundtracks of the year"
3,"""SLOW DOWN""","""Whoa now/Cat's making this soundtrack sound wack/In fact/Soundtrack demonstrates that ""Eminem"" is taking this rap game/ to another galaxy that forms in only ""other men"" fantasies/This soundtrack tight like ""fat chicks"" panties/Thongs/The only knock is ""Em"" tried to correct 1 right with ""two wrongs""/Two songs/ ""Adrenaline Rush""and ""Time Of Your Life""/ Image ""Macy Gray"" and ""Obie Trice"" daughter would look like/Damn near back to back bad luck/Like locking your keys in your trunk/Sucks but your not going home tonight/Soundtrack barks but doesn't ""bite""/Like trying to get drunk but drinking ""Light"" - Dimpals a.k.a. ""sOMe adVIce"""
3,Kinda weak,"When I heard that sons Lose Yourself on the radio I was hooked, so I had to get the soundtrack. But unfortunatley that is about as good as it gets. The song Rap Game by D12 is also nice, but the rest isn't really impressive. 50 cent does an ok job, and Jay'Z too, but like the Obie Trice song and others alike are just weak, nothing I'd listen to more than once."
3,I Can't say I liked the whole album,"If I'd say that I would be cheatin myself and all of you. Eminem is the star here. ""Lose Yourself"" is Eminem's best track to date and his other songs here are quite good too, but... rest of the album isn't good. Only Gang Starr's ""Battle"" and Obie Trice's ""Adrenaline Rush"" are worth of listen besides Eminem's stuff."
4,very suprised.....eminem is fantastic here,"...when I heard ""Lose Yourself"" I was hypnotised. I have never heard more powerful lyrics in my life. More importantly, I felt that the song had a POSITIVE message which is rare for Eminem. Anyway since this soundtrack is the only place to get it, i would highly recommend this soundtrack. As for the other tracks they are very good.... BUY IT!"
5,Eminem strikes again with,"This disc is awesome! Em's 3 new songs are, in my opinion, the best on the disc. The songs I'm referring to are ""Lose Yourself,"" (of course) ""8 Mile,"" and ""Rabbit Run."" I never really used to like Eminem, but then, I bought ""The Eminem Show,"" and I was instantly hooked! He doesn't b-s the world into thinking that superstardom is the greatest thing, but is honest about his own life, and he just throws reality into every listener's face. I respect him for that. Anyways, ""Lose Yourself"" is a perfect theme for the movie, which I CANNOT wait to see. I'm looking forward to seeing how his performance lives up to its hype. Hats off to you, Em! Got another hit with this one! For those of you who don't have it, go out and get it! If you're a fan or you just like Eminem, you won't be disappointed!"
4,"A place in your collection, but not in history","Eminem has some unique poetic tricks in his writing that are even more surprising than the words and topics he employs. But this mix includes artists who are good but much more comforting (such Macy Gray, still underrated as a vocalist) and others are much less comforting and much less talented (such as 50 cent, vastly overrated as artist of any kind).In toto, this ""soundtrack"" (itself a misnomer, since it includes many trakcs simply ""inspired by"" the movie, rather than from it) includes a fabulous first track, and then fifteen tracks that mire in mediocrcity. They're fine as background for cubicle work, but don't mark any unique or interesting turn in cultural history.Yeah, we've had enough of Shady. But are cameo collections all that will follow?"
4,Amazing,"Hey, Blob ""Blob"". How can you deny Eminem's talent? Could you think of lines like ""sometimes I just feel like/quittin I still might/Why do I put up this fight/Why do I still write/Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics/And show these people what my level of skills like/But I'm still white/Sometimes I jst hate life/Something ain't right/Hit the brake lights/Case of the stage fright/Drawin a blank light//""? I don't think so!! I can't give this 5 stars, because that makes it a classic, which it's not, but it's a great CD."
3,"Eminem Rules, The Others Are Okay","The Best Tracks:Lose Yourself (Eminem) - 9/10Love Me (Eminem, 50 Cent, Obie Trice) - 7/108 Mile (Eminem) - 9/10Rap Game (D12) - 9/108 Miles And Runnin (Jay Z, Freeway) - 8/10Wanksta (50 Cent) - 9/10Rabbit Run (Eminem) - 10/10An alright soundtrack, buy it for just the artists above.Overall - 8.9/10"
2,That voice,"Taryn Manning was compelling in 8 mile as the ex and she's even more compelling singing. ""Wasting My Time"" is my absolute favorite song on this soundtrack."
2,Not what I expected,"When I saw the artists touted on the album cover, I thought the album would be promising. But except for the 1st song, ""Lose Yourself,"" the rest of the album is pretty weak. I was even disappointed with some of my favorite artists, NAS and Gang Starr."
2,Disappointing,I love Em and the only good songs on this album are the first one and the last one. The rest just seem like filler.
1,Eminem got it backwards but what else would you expect?,"whenever a Music Artist makes a film&has a Soundtrack naturally the Soundtrack will out last the film right? wrong.the film is getting alot more attention&after hearing this Album I can see why.Eminem is a Ok Artist who is catchy,Cleaver&has a certain charm with certain songs but this CD doesn't have Him all the way through.if the Record Company had have been Smarter they would have Milked Eminem's Version of ""Purple Rain"" With Him doing the whole Soundtrack.at this stage of the Game Eminem doesn't need any outside guests.this disc beyond the so-so lead single is weak."
1,Not Oscar worthy at all,"Second rate rap by a white boi (Beastie Boys are far superior artists), our resident momma's boy must resort to more violence and shock to sell records. Nothing new here."
1,Disappointment is not a strong enough word,"The only songs worth anything on this album are the ones by Rakim and Gang Starr and, of course, you can't download only those songs. You have to get the whole stupid album which is full of Eminem and other worthless artists (all of whom should trip and scrape their faces in a puddle of AIDS). Honestly, why not let us get the two worthwhile songs and disregard the rest? I'd almost be willing to buy this if it wasn't filled with 80-85% garbage. Frustrated after going through Amazon, Napster, and several other sites to get the songs I want, only to be told I have to buy the whole piece of crap album to ""8 Mile,"" (which I won't even start to get into because I'll stab my own eyes out). This is a kick in the face for sure."
3,Only one reason to cop this album. . . . . . . . 50 Cent,"(...) all the D-12 and Eminem (...)(don't get me wrong, hes a great rapper and lyricist)this is 50 Cents time to shine. ""Wanksta"" is the best rap single to be released in a long time. His flow is slow and matches perfectly with shady's beats. Not only can he flow but this cat can write. He raps with an attitude and will take over the rap game in the years to come (time for Em to step out and let 50 enter). So purchasing this album for (...)$ is well worth it...just for the 3 songs featuring 50.........."
5,This cd is off the hook,"Man Please buy the 8 Mile soundtrack dawg. This album has all new eminem songs. Also new to shady records, 50 Cent also has a couple nice tracks. Nas and Jayz also have new tracks on this joint. But man, the best track is lose yourself. The next 3 best tracks on the album are Love Me, Rap Game, and 8 Mile. Also the bonus material is the stuff. Man im like the biggest fan of eminem. I truly recommend this album to anyone who has a style for music."
4,NICE PROJECT FROM SHADY/AFTERMATH,"This compilation features the overplayed but very good ""Lose Yourself"" from Eminem. Also featured are some of rap's best veterans like Jay-Z,Nas,Rakim,and Xzibit bringing some good songs to the soundtrack. I only have one problem with this album and that is the Macy Gray song that I have only been able to put up with through one listen. Her voice is horrible and I dont know why she is even on here. Another great feature is the Shady/Aftermath sampler promo disc which features more songs from Eminem, Obice Trice, and others. Overall this is a pretty good rap album and ""Lose Yourself"" alone is worth the price."
4,8MILE OST,"I have found myself more and more impressed with what Shady has to offer. He alwayz seemz hungry, like he's alwayz on the grind and never willing to give in. & alwayz fighting with each word spoken for what he strivez for, he seemz to be limitless, az hiz successed yet still hungered appetite atonez. 8MILE iz just the next example. Shady Recz haz put together a great soundtracc. Not since the Row (bacc in the day) have we seen a rap record lable put out great work based loosely on a movie. 50 Cent, before the 8MILE OST, waz just another New York cat that I never really concerned my thoughtz with. After owning the 8M OST for 8 weekz, I am now looking forward to hiz albumz to drop, and Im pickin up hiz release the day it dropz. Im anticipatin it more than OBI TRICE. & Em's Rabbit Run waz an opertunity for Em to really manipulate the microphone, just really push hiz wordz and voice. He iz still steadily improving. I do recommend the OST, az much az I do the EShow LP."
2,not what i expected...,"eminem..he's as talented as he is dreamy eh? haha, kidding.Personally, i love em...and i LIKED 'Lose Yourself'...but after hearing it on the radio a billion times, and still hearing it (as well as his other 20 singles!), i'm gettng sick of him. There are probably only two or three songs on that album that i liked, and 'Lose Yourself' was one of them. But now, me being sick of it, it was a waste of my money. the other ones songs are terrible."
5,Good Album But Cant Stand The Guest,Eminem is probaly the most talented artist right now out of anyone.Love him or hate him you have to hand it to him.Eminem just realeased a movie november 8th and it was an awsome display of how eminem grew up in D.E.The song Lose Yourself is a very inspirational song.Its not his best but its not at all bad.Its a cd to put up on the shelf.If you like rap and r and b youll like this.Em has 4 songs on here i think but overall there all good.GO BUY THIS RIGHT NOW PUNK!
5,Great Rapper+Great Actor= 1 Awsome CD,"This CD is definitly worth your $. Not only has eminem resently put out his album but also makes this one. His acting performance in 8 Mile was great and no Eminem fan can get along without this. If you liked 8 Mile or if you like Eminem, Get this cd!"
5,Tightest Rap Singer,TO me Eminem is one of the tightest singers.Just for one day i would like to meet him.I have all of his CD's.Some songs in his CD's are slow but its all good.I just cant wait untill his 8 Mile movie comes out in theaters this friday.When I go and see the movie I think its going to be bad as hell.To me I think he is one of the best singers.
4,"Great Eminem, Okay Soundtrack","Eminem, first of all, is a great artist. He has the best beats, lyrics, best everything! Eminem doesn't disappoint with his songs on the album, but the other songs, kinda stink. My favorite rapper is Eminem, but I like other rappers too. I am disappointed that Dr. Dre is not on the album, along with hardly any other big names in rap, except for Xzibit and maybe Jay-Z. Favorite tracks for me are 8 Mile, Love You, and, of course, Lose Yourself. These tracks really bring out the film, and take us all back to Eminem's earlier albums like The Marshall Mathers Lp. A big change from his latest album, The Eminem Show. These songs definitely do not disappoint! They are superb. The other songs are worth a listen, but don't satisfy completely. Eminem's tracks will leave you hungry for more of them, and the other songs lead you away feeling, ""That was good, but not great."" Above all, get this album if you like Eminem. Otherwise, maybe download it, or borrow from a friend."
3,Good soundtrack cd,"The songs ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love Me"", ""Rap Game"", ""8 Miles and Running"", ""Battle"" and ""Rabbit Run"". The rest are average. Nas, Rakim and Xzibit dissapoint. ""Adrenaline Rush"" has a great beat, but the excessive cursing ruins it. In this limited edition, there is a cd with 6 songs. The best are: Rap Name by Obie Trice, Stimulate by Eminem and The Weekend by Brooklyn. A great buy. I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars. (The DeskSite is excellent)"
1,A one hit wonder,"I can't belive i spent my money on one song. The ony good song on the album is loose yourself. The rest of the stuff is just plain pathetic 'cause it is overproduced and they try so, so, so hard to be hard core, when really those rappers live in like 10 million dollar mansions. I just ain't feeling this one."
1,"You're all kidding, right?","I keep seeing the word ""great"" here. Let's clarify something. Greatness necessitates talent -- talent meaning a real gift and the discipline to perfect it. Caruso was great. Sinatra was great. Even Elvis, in his way, was great (disregarding the movies). But a rapper (any rapper)? In this instance, a tattoo-mangled kid whose ""music"" consists of sing-song rhymes about profanity (trust me, when you use that much profanity, your message becomes the profanity and nothing else)? Please, people. Tell me our civilization hasn't sunk this low this fast. People who are flocking to this film and to Amazon to buy this CD are lemmings. It's a long drop."
2,whack,"the ONLY reason i gave this album 2 stars instead of 1 is the respect is have for rakim and gang starr(although they both made much better songs). and to the ""If u want real good rap, get any tupac or 50 cent cd, and itll blow this one away.~Peace playaz"" guy, who calles rakim ""Retarted And Korny Irregular Monkeysock"", don't believe the hype.. 50 cent is so much whacker than rakim.. just check out ""Paid In Full"" by eric b and rakim (dropped almost 20 years ago and still a classic), to get an example of some ""real good rap""..."
3,Overrated!,"Eminem is the main featured rap artist on this album...but I have to say, his songs kind of [were bad] on this soundtrack. And what's the deal with having Macy Gray on this soundtrack??? But, I was impressed with some of the other songs by the other artists. D-12's song ""Rap Game"" was great so were the song's by the following artists: Xzibit, Nas, 50-cent, Rakim (a rap legend), and Obie Trice is a funny rapper. I think Eminem should stick to his more comical rap style rather than trying to be more serious. I don't think it works for him."
4,Review,"I recieved this book in great condition and it arrived quickly and before time. I would enjoy it more if I had gotten large print, the writing is really small. Its a wonderful bible though."
3,Beautiful cover but writing so small I cannot enjoy,"I should have listened to the reviews about the small writing, this is a beautiful book the cover the silk bookmark, but the pages I cannot read, the writing is so tiny that I lost the enjoyment of reading it, I am trying to read the bible to understand it that is why I purchased this one, I should have done the large print, this is such a disappointment to me, I am going to try to get one of those magnifying glass squares and see if that works better for me,"
2,Words too small,I like it but had to strain to read it. The print is too small!!!!!!! I would not recommend this book to anyone over 50.
1,godsgloria,"When I ordered the Dake Bible I thought that it was a large print bible , so I was very disappointed when it arrived. Unfortunately I cannot return it because it was sent to someone in Jamaica who is 61 years old and cannot even read the print they are so small."
3,Not what I thought,Looking thru the Fence/ Diamonds in the RoughThis Bible has received a lot of positive reviews but I find that I will have to take time to learn how to use it efficiently.
2,THE DAKE BIBLE,very dissappointed by this bible it is very complicated. I have heard so much about this bible that I decided to get it. I heard that it was so easy to understand but this version is far from it.
2,I sent it back,The Bible I ordered was too small for me to read. I sent it back. I want that bible but I need it in large print. I can't find thr right price.
2,Dake Annotated Ref Bible KJV,Lot of this information is outdated or outright wrong. Large print is much better on the eyes.
1,Dake Annotated Reference Bible-KJV (Hardcover),"Disappointed it was not the large print edition I was expecting according to the view shown when I evaluated what the book looked like. Now I don't have time to return it because I need it for bible classes. Having alot of difficulty reading it I need my glasses and a magnifing sheet. Otherwise the price, content and value of information is good."
3,Lessons on Life,"Tells you a little about Madonna's ideals and perspectives on life. Although a worthy collctible, it's probably more geared to her female fans..."
1,"Let's Get Serious, Shall We?!",Just another proof positive example of the rich getting richer on the backs of the stupid struggling to get stupider.Nuff said!
4,Nice Old School Touch....,"Nice little touch,....had multiple people ask me how it is to own a Hurst Edition Challenger,......lol..........looks great if you stick it on rear spoiler where SRT logo would go........also got one on dash right under Challenger logo, everybody says it looks like it was from factory, looks great"
4,Nice but plastic,The emblem looks nice but for what I paid I was expecting it to be metal. Love my short throw shifter for the Dodge Challenger!
4,Polkas From American Bands,"ALL the music on these 5 CD's have nothing to do with music performed in Poland by Polish people. ALL of these tracks I have in my vast vinyl record collection of Polka Bands from New England which were recorded back in the 40's, 50's, 60's, and 70's. Whoever, put out this 5 CD set has ""duped"" the public into thinking that this is authentic Polish music from Poland. In fact all this music has been ""Plagiarized"" from older vinyl records or SOMEONE has SOMEHOW gotten their ""greedy"" hands on the original masters of this music and transferred it to CD. My advice is to boycott the purchase of this set of CD's because it clearly gives NO CREDIT to the bands, composers, and arrangers that originally copyrighted this music. It hurts me to give such a review of this music, but the ""TRUTH MUST BE KNOWN."""
3,"Should be called ""World Music: Polish-Americans""","Don't expect this album to live up to the title ""World Music: Poland"".My guess is that these are all recordings of Polish-American bands, because several of the tracks have texts in English or titles indicating that they were written in the US rather than Poland. And -- this is ridiculous -- a couple of tracks are arrangements of theme songs from 1960s American television shows.If you're looking for music of the Polish diaspora, I suppose this album qualifies, but if you're looking for music of Poland performed in Poland by Poles, keep looking."
2,Big Disappointment,"Because I liked the way the 30 shred was setup, I (wrongly) assumed the beginning level would be the same, only set up for beginners like myself.It is a boring, uninspiring presentation, which has too many stops between exercises and has little diversity of patterns. It gets the job done, if you can hang with it. Michaels other DVD's are much better (just too hard at present)"
1,This Video Stinks,"To do this video you need two sets of weights, a step, and a chair. I think a lot of these moves aren't right for beginners (without having a fitness instructor with you) because they are high impact, and it would be really easy to hurt yourself if you do the moves incorrectly. Also, Jillian seems like she's just kind of winging it every time she talks...like there is no script. All of the exercises are disjointed...it would be very hard to just pop this DVD in a get a good workout because of all of the pauses and Jillian's pointless monologues. FOR ME, THIS VIDEO WAS MORE OF A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT THAN A BIG HELP."
2,Waste of money,Save your money it's not worth it. The video has a all white back ground with just jillian and one of three people from biggest loser and a chair and a mat. The people don't seem to know what to do there behind her doing moves that she's decribing but there doing them wrong. Better off getting Shaping up for dummies it's the same thing but the instructor does all the moves her self.
5,Great Full Body Workout,I just got this DVD and have only done the Frontside and so far I know this is the DVD I've been looking for. It tones the whole body....not just certain sections.
5,Perfect for beginners,"I'm a fan of several other Jillian DVDs and got this for my mom. The pace is slow and the exercises are explained well. The people demonstrating the moves are former Biggest Loser contestants instead of the typical hard bodied women who might be intimidating or discouraging for people just starting out. Jillian is far more encouraging than tough in this DVD, as well, which I think helps."
3,Not Impressed,"I bought this one because I like Jillian, but found her other frontside/backside workouts still a little too advanced for me.The moves here are good and will work if you put effort into them - but the pace is incredibly slow! Jillian gives good explanations about proper positioning and other tips, but I wish this had been in separate or optional setting - you have to hear everything every time and that takes away from the actual workout time. Often, the former BL contestants (and Me) finish our counts and then have to wait for her to finish talking. If you are new to working out, this could be good for its explanations - but if you just want to get down to it and get things done, then this one is not for you."
4,Review,"Since I am a personal trainer, I am always looking for new ideas. I thought this dvd was one that gets the job done for beginners. A good interval to get the heart rate up followed by a strength exercise. The weakest part of the video was the abs section. This dvd has more instruction than her other dvds so it will be helpful for inexperienced exercisers."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping for a video that had a continuous workout from warm up to cool down, incorporating all the excercises in a circuit-like program. She shows four different people doing the different excercises, quits after each person is done with their section and then switches to the next person. I wanted a streamlined, all-in-one training. There are good moves and I could make up my own training, but I just want to follow a good workout tape. This is too chopped up."
4,a good place to start,"After coming down with type 2 Diabetes, I decided to add a workout to my sedentary work day. I started here because of a friend had great results with Jillian Michaels' video. This video is great. Workouts are pretty simple, move quick and really get your heart rate up. You get basic workouts, and Jillian has her helpers also demonstrate more advanced techniques to add on to your exercises as you advance. This gets 4 stars because there are a couple of moves that should be broken down and demonstrated more clearly but aren't. Some of the camera angles could be better to show you how to position your body. Other than that, this is a great place to start to get in shape. You will need hand weights (any lbs) and a tension band."
3,Boring but Good Workout,I agree with previous reviewers that it was on the boring side (not at all what I expected from Jillian!). The workout can be as tough as you make it but it's hard to stay energetic with such a boring video....
3,Front and Back side both are great workouts,I loved the workout not easy but no hard either.. alot of shoulder work in some of the workouts hard since I have had shoulder surgery.. Some of the positions require upper body.. Great workout though
3,"Great for total novice, not for experienced exercisers","This would be fantastic for someone who is just starting a work out program. I've worked out for years, but wanted to see what Jillian's videos were all about. She does an excellent job of explaining the purpose behind every exercise and she does talk about proper form. That said, there's just too much talk and too much time between exercises for someone who just wants to burn through the routines and keep their heart rate up.However, if you are a true beginner, then this video would be great for you."
5,Jillian Rocks!,This DVD set is just what I was looking for. I was searching for a complete body workout and this is it. Frontside can be done one day and Backside can be done another day (approximatley 45 minutes each). I actually do both all in one day -- approximately a 2-hour workout. Some of the exercises are unique -- ie. King sqauts -- boy do you feel the burn. You will not be sorry.
2,"Jillian is a good instructor, but her choice of coworkers?????????",Really? These are the most attractive people she could find to put in these videos? You have to watch these over and over day after day and each one of these folks is more of a bow wow than the one before.
5,love it!,"I love that there is no 'set', no overly chipper people (you work out at 4:15 a.m. and see how much you like chipper people!), and that it can move from easier to challenging. Not that it's all that easy to start worth...make no mistake, it's basic moves, but you do sweat the entire time. My absolute favorite workout, and my husband will do it with me since there are no crazy dance steps involved."
1,Not my favorite,"I hate to say this since Philosophy is one of my favorite brands, but this is probably the worst mascara I have ever used. It clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove. It does not simply wash off, it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink. About half of them remain attached to your lashes, and I've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara. Everything else I've ever tried from Philosophy was fantastic, but the best mascara out there, hands down, is from Lancome."
3,I expected ... more,"I first read about this book on Geek Dad (Wired.com) and it sounded great. It didn't hurt that the article was ABOUT a real-life lightning gun that some geek-guy made in his basement (""warning: do not try this at home"" kind of thing). So the book sounded great and I had very high expectations.Which crashed and burned when I actually obtained a copy and read it. It's okay, and I got a few laughs from it, but the plot was trivial and contrived. I enjoyed the art, but it isn't enough to warrant buying the book.SO, if you know the authors, or love geeky science stuff - you MIGHT like this. If you're looking for a good story, give it a pass and spend your money more wisely."
3,cool new look,"This is a very cool graphic novel. I bought it to be used in a middle school, however, and it has a good deal of coarse language. Not really appropriate for children."
3,"Not Bad, Maybe Typical, But That's Cool","I had the opportunity to read this through a friend, and was primarilycurious because of similarity to a book my company released in late 2005and I love this genre.Though I am a BIG fan of historical era adventure(my company publishes the stuff), I find too much of it lackingin the graphic novel arena.Five Fists fortunately wasn't as lacking as most, but failed to grab me completely.That may be because I don't come from a background of loving comics.The artwork is worth the effort, definitely, and the presentation does thegenre justice even if it reminds readers of Alan Moore or others. I'm OKwith that; nothing wrong with emulation and Five Fists does a solid jobof capturing the genre's strong points.If you'd like a better treatment of the Tesla and Twain relationship,check out WONDER OF THE WORLDS (0-9727472-8-1) by Sesh Heri.I recommend FIVE FISTS OF SCIENCE to anyone who likes this genre."
4,Worth getting for steampunk fans,"The very premise is enough to get this book. Tesla and Mark Twain team up to fight the evil forces of Edison. So awesome. A rare find, definitely pick it up if it at all intrigues you."
3,Nothing Special,"Following in the footsteps of Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and many of DC's Elseworlds comics, this graphic novel sends Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla up against the militaristic climate of the late 19th century and against JP Morgan and Thomas Edison. Alas, it doesn't really do much with them as the plot stalls out and then grows too muddled. While the art is certainly superior to that in Moore's League books, and the heroes are a lot more likeable, this lags behind the League books in terms of story and behind such forgotten comics as Batman/Houdini in mixing famous figures with the fantastical. Fans of historical fiction writ large might enjoy this, as might comic book readers looking for something different. But is otherwsie not a must-read."
2,"Great concept, rushed execution","The setup for this is a whole lot of fun. Clever, acknowledging the history of the figures while shamelessly and cheerfully manipulating them for the sake of the story, and throwing in all sorts of delightful robots and magic. But in this short volume, it feels very rushed, so you don't get enough time to appreciate the characters and figure out what's going on. This wanted to be a five-volume set, not one stand-alone story. But if it's in your library and you're into steampunk, give it a read."
2,"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, redux (re-read 6/10)","Obviously this books bites off of the League concepts quite thoroughly. But instead of clever dialogue, they susbsitute action hero mechanics with historical names (Thomas Edison, Sameul Clemons). Meaning, they take a standard super-hero story, and drop some old names in it. This book could have been much better if they would have utilized the nuances of the characters more. Instead, those geniuses of years past are given nothing to work with, and their uniqenesses are wasted as serial villians or heroes. Barnum! is an almost identical read.Re-readability: 6/10*I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read*"
2,"The more I think about it, the less I like it.","The more I think about this steampunk work, the less I like it. While I'm a huge fan of Nikola Tesla, the chemistry between he and Samuel Clemens is tepid at best in this lame adventure novel. Likewise, there's third main character who's completely fictional and isn't handled well at all. In a word, this work is a mess. It feels like a watered down LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN."
3,"Entertaining, but didn't live up to its promise","I started in on this comic with high expectations. Tesla has always been a hero of mine, especially as the details of how he was cheated out of credit for his greatest inventions start to become known to popular culture. I'm sad to say that the comic fell fairly short of what I was hoping it would be.The idea of Tesla and Twain teaming up to bring peace to the world sounded awesome, and while Tesla and Twain are both written pitch-perfectly - and some of the supporting characters feel pretty solid too - the story as a whole feels nearly incoherent. I get the overall arc of it, but it just feels like it was a story that wanted to be much larger than a single trade paperback comic volume; in the end, there's a lot that's sort of crammed into the story edgewise without a lot of explanation, and the end of the comic just left me feeling unsatisfied."
3,Underwhelming Comic,"I was pretty excited about this comic when I saw Tesla and Twain on the cover. The comic is supposed to be funny by having Twain make wisecracks and have Tesla use his scientific prowess to make cool robots, or make cool weapons to stop criminals.The comic is funny at times, specially with Tesla's quirks. However, the story is not very interesting and overall I was underwhelmed with this tale.I did like the art and there are many cool panels in this book. It is just not a book I would recommend."
4,Great take on a historical rivalry!,It's a thoroughly enjoyable read that plays up some of Tesla's biggest quirks (being OCD and a ladies man) and a fun take on his rival/nemesis Edison.
4,amazing,"I read this book for a biography report. I actually am not a big , fan of biographies, but this one reads like a novel. The book has a glossary in the back which is very helpful. It exceeded all of my expectations and I reccomend it to all ages 12 and above."
1,Can't take the heat,"Used it once. Wanted to see what the grill temp was on high on my Weber gas grill, and the thing was toasted. Burned up the paint inside and made the glass completely black inside. All the paint inside flaked off and is now fills the unit like loose sand. When it cooled down, it was stuck at 225. If it weren't so cheap, I'd return it. But at around eight bucks, it hardly seems worth the effort."
2,Over priced.,Overly expensive. Very slow shipping. I would avoid this supplier. The person that received this product as a gift reported that he didn't care for it. So next year we'll look elsewhere.
1,Projector bulb,"The box warned that this product was delicate and subject to failure from shock. I placed the bulb in the projector, turned on the projector, was adjusting the focus, moved the projector for a optimum projected picture and that was enough to blow the filament. I am glad I got two bulbs."
5,From the Heart of Covington,"This series is wonderful, and this book is especially good. It (and all the novels in this series) deals with serious life matters older people face, and yet there are enough younger characters involved to give it a contemporary feel. As a senior myself, I share many of the feelings of the main characters (fears about health issues, concern for my children, how to stay active as I age, etc.) It's like having a really good time with some of my best friends. Medlicott does a great job of interweaving the story lines until you feel like part of the family and can't wait to see what happens next. The ""ladies of Covington"" are endearing and vulnerable women, but in themselves and their friendships they find strength that should be an encouragement to us all."
4,A delightful series,"The latest in the saga of the three ladies, and such a delight to read. No murder, no violence, true to life characters. One of those books you hate to see end."
4,Heart of Covington,The book was in good condition. This is the 2nd book I have read in this series and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Being a senior citizen I can relate to many of the things brought up in this novel. I look forward to reading others in this series.
5,The Covington ladies rule!,"Yet another wonderful read in the Covington ladies series....I came to this series late, and read them ALL in a matter of a month. I felt as though I had moved in next door! Do you need to find a quiet place to use as sanctuary from your busy life? Go to Covington...you don't even need to pack an overnight bag! Life slows down, and when you close the book, I guarantee you'll bring something back with you that will lend perspective to your own existence, maelstrom or otherwise. Enjoy!"
3,The ladies face serious issues,"The author fills the first part of the book with a breathtaking array of problems including, death, near-death, estrangement of family members, and serious illness. Things definitely improve from there as Hannah begins working on the Gardens of Covington, Amelia pursues her photography and takes on a new volunteer job, and Grace entertains family and friends with her home-cooked meals. There are some loose ends in this book, such as when the family and friends take a trip to a nearby lake which includes their friend Emily, but inexplicably not her husband Russell or her step-son, Tyler. There is a subplot about a little girl that Grace works with in her volunteer job which kind of fizzles and goes nowhere. Although in my opinion this is not the best book of the series, it would probably behoove Covington fans to read this installment in order to understand what is happening to the characters."
2,New Age Mitford Book,"If you want a Jan Karon Book with adultery, gays, and anti Christian values, read this series! Jan Medlicott has ""modernized"" the Mitford series-but included ""familiar things"" such as a sweet red haired boy character and drawn sketches of the town of Covington for examples-right out of Mitford-- there are so many similarities that I wonder how she ""got away with it""! Come back Jan Karon!"
3,Not what I expected,"This doesnt' hold heat or cold for very long.After about five minutes or so, the temp (hot or cold) begins to fade. I already have something similar to do this, and it too doesn't hold temps well...I purchased this one because I thought it would do otherwise. I gave it three stars instead of two because the shape is just right and fits perfectly on my neck. Overall, I'm very disappointed with it's performance."
2,Doesn't stay hot for long,This doesn't stay hot long enough to do any good. I ended up using this as a cold pack for headaches instead of a hot pack for my neck as intended. I wish I could have one of those hot pads from the physical therapy office instead.
3,Qaulity issue,"I ordered two themalon wraps. They work well,but one of the two failed within five heating cycles. We followed the microwave instructions carefully. The neck wrap developed a hole, and the beads spread to every corner the room. The other larger wrap has worked well but the fabric pilled, and looks well beyond its age. Amazon was excellent about replacing the faultly wrap. We did accept a replacemant. We are happy overall."
2,Not great for heat,This product does not do well for heat. I warmed it in the microwave less than the time suggested and a hole developed and the product leaked beads everywhere. Not happy.
5,Great product!,"I am very happy with this product. My physical therapist uses something like it to treat my neck pain. I like the fact that it can be heated in the microwave or chilled in the freezer. It is easy to handle and to adjust.Thermalon Microwave Activated Moist Heat-Cold Neck Wrap for Neck and Shoulder, 21"""
2,Ho-hum,Convenient. Wonderful moist heat as advertised.But the heat does not last very long. Also the product is not machine washable. It's just washable by hand.
3,Disappointed,"Feels good while it's on but only stays warm around 20 min. The second day after I bought the neck wrap, I put it in the microwave for 1 min. and 45 sec. I took it out and while I was carrying it, I felt all these hot beads burning my hands. I looked and there was a big hole in it. I called the 800 number and left a message and no one returned my call. I also went to their website and sent a comment explaining what had happened and they never responded."
4,Works pretty well...mostly,"I have muscle spasm problems in my neck/shoulder area, so I ordered this to see if it would help. It is a nice idea, in theory. The problem I have with it is it doesn't stay warm for very long, which makes it a bit of a hassle to keep heating it up. I love the fact that I can tie it to keep it in place. If you don't mind heating it up often, its great."
2,Does not stay warm for very long at all,"I ordered this because I wanted another moist heat heating pad, and I have used it a couple of times. Unfortunately, even when heating it to the max recommended time in the microwave it only holds heat for about 10 or 15 minutes at the max. Because I ordered this heating pad to be a secondary one (I use the Bed Buddy as my main heating pad, and it holds heat for about an hour) I'm not going to go through the trouble to return it, but I am disappointed that I paid $18 for something that essentially doesn't work. I'll have to try it as a cold pack and see if that works better.Also, it has a pretty strong, bad smell.I gave it two stars because the ties are nice and the beads didn't pour out like some other reviewers have warned about."
1,Not happy with product,"This product was great for the first 10 uses but then wore down and had a hole burnt into it while in the microwave. It was not in the microwave for more than a minute and burnt a whole then all the little white balls fell, out everywhere. To make a long story short this product does not hold up to the heat use and I would not buy another one again."
5,good after too much typing,"My neck and shoulders knot up after too much typing or grocery-carrying. This wrap is not too heavy, is the right shape to drape over the stiff bits, and doesn't have any annoying ""perfumes"". It doesn't stay hot as long as bigger ones but that's the price you pay for its being lightweight."
1,Burnt holes in wrap after one day!,"I tried this wrap and was very happy with it the first time i put it in the microwave. It was a very comfortable warm, moist heat. Two hours later I wanted to warm it up and have the same experience. After I pulled the wrap out of the microwave a million tiny beads flew all over my kitchen. I was like wtf! I looked at the wrap and saw 3 melted holes in it. I took it back and got a new one, the same exact thing happened!!! The second time the new wrap went in the microwave, beads everywhere! 40 bucks later I learned my leason!!!"
3,"May be like a strange feeling, but man it's nice!","The heat lasts for a little bit, but if you're totally out of commission you'll need somebody to heat the thing up for you when you can't move. Growing old is so sweet!"
4,Not bad,I only use it for heat as I have a col pac for when I need a cold one. I only gave it a four star because I have a small neck and it doesn't fit very well. I don't like the way it ties but I get good heat from it. Be sure you don't over heat it as it will burn if it's too hot.
3,Melted in the first day.,Read the instructions before using. Approximately a 2 cm hole opened up after the second microwaving.... dont microwave it more then 1:30 mins after u already microwaved it once within 30mins.
4,Good carpet cleaner for apartments and small houses,"I purchased the Bissell 2070 carpet cleaner and received it quickly. It is easy to assemble but you do need to read the manual on how to use it if you have never used one before. The container that holds the hot water with cleaner is easy to remove by lifting off the machine and refill. It holds enough liquid to clean about a 10' x 10' room.It is a little harder to remove the dirty water storage tank and you have to lay the handle down (easy to do) to remove it. I cleaned a 2 bedroom 1040 sq. ft. apartment in about 2 hours. I moved only small furniture. I think it did a fair job but probably not as good as a professional cleaning. The power brush does pick up a lot of hair even though my wife vacummed first. If you have more than about 1200 sq. ft. I would suggest a larger machine and Bissell does make those too. for apartments, this works well and is easy to store."
4,Nice!,"We are happy with the purchase of our deep cleaner. It cleans the carpets very nicely and cleans up easily afterwards. I felt that it was a little difficult to understand the directions when putting the pieces together. For what you pay for a rental, you can own your own cleaner. Overall, we recommend this cleaner."
1,DO NOT Buy-- broke after 3 uses and no tech support from company,"I have a small home and thought this lightweight machine would be perfect for the occassional cleanings. I couldn't have been more wrong! I used it 3 times without problem. Then it started leaving track marks all over my carpet. It didn't look that way when wet, but would dry that way the next morning. I called customer support and got no help. They didn't seem to be very knowledgeable about their equipment. Their solution was to clean the carpet twice- once with solution and then do it all over again with regular water. The warranty is 1 year. I called at 1 year and 1 month having used it only 5 times and got no support. Save your money. Buy another brand altogether."
4,Great Cleaner,"This Bissell was great. I followed the directions and it was so simple. You have to get use to the trigger and letting go as you push and pull the steam cleaner. It took pet stains, baby stains and drink stains out of my carpets. I have a variety of carpet styles from thick pile/shag berber to low pile nylon carpet. I would recommend this to you."
5,LOVE this little machine,"I love this machine! I have owned several expensive brands in the past and even though their cleaning paths were wider, they don't come close to the cleaning ability of this cleaner. It is lightweight, powerful and very easy to clean after use. After using it, my carpets look professionally cleaned and it got out tough older stains, too! It's also a breeze to dig out and use for spot areas created thanks to the dog. My other machines were a major project to haul in the house and set up before use. I recommend this machine to anyone looking for a quick, simple way to maintain the look of their carpets. One tip: vacuum the carpet before using it - because of it's power, it will also pull up any carpet lint or dog hair and that can get messy. Thanks Bissell for making my life easier!!"
1,What steam?? BEWARE!!,"The name of this product is TOTALLY misleading -- a LIE. I bought it because I wanted the cleaning power of STEAM - which it says right in the name! What I got was a tool for applying rug cleaning solution - who needs that? Resolve makes a good foam solution you apply with a 50 cent sponge. My respect for Bissell went waaay down. To add insult to injury, I have to pay shipping to return it."
5,Good Little Machine,"This is a nice, lightweight, portable carpet cleaner. Works great if you have kids and pets, carpets look great. Tends to clog up fast if you have lots of pet hair, but easy to fix. I recommend this!"
5,THE best purchase i've made,"After reading the reviews i checked out the bissel website. Try clicking on all the links of the other stores that have this. Because of amazon review guidelines i cant name the store but you will be able to save a hefty chunk of change.I bought this cleaner based upon the reviews given here on amazon. I have 2 children, a 1 yr old, a 5 mth old, so needless to say the rugs can get mighty dirty.I received it today and used it in my living room. I have got to say that this is a great cleaner. It is very lightweight and easy to assemble. In less than a minute the stains that were tracked inside from the berry tree thats outside of my home were gone. I could not believe it. I suggest everyone who is looking for a lightweight cleaner grab this one.Thank You to all the reviewers. Your reviews are what encouraged me to get this."
5,Good for smaller areas,"What an easy and quick way to clean smaller areas. I bought this mainly for cleaning the carpet in my family room which is high traffic. I also have an aging dog that sometimes has accidents on the carpet. This is easy to get out, fill, run, and especially easy to empty and clean. Ideal for this kind of cleaning. I was at first skeptical about the size but it has proved to do just what I needed it for."
5,Darn good vacuum !,"We received this machine about two weeks ago and we think its an amazing value. I know we hear hyperbole about almost everything these days, this vacuum is definitely not hype.Quality construction, powerful, easy to clean and easy to use. The only criticism I have is that the power brush does not stop when the handle is in the upright position when using the tools for the hose or changing the brush height. We bought the machine with the HEPA filter and it's worked better than expected. You won't be sorry you bought this vacuum. Real value for the price, judge for yourself!"
4,Great Vacuum,I really like this vacuum. It really picks up the dirt. It does a great job around the edges of the carpet and walls.I like the on board attachments. I just wish it had a tool for using on the furniture and steps.I'd buy it again if I was looking for a new vacuum.
2,Very blah,"Pros:It's pretty light and maneuverable. It was easy to empty out the collection bin. Cleaning the filter was a dirty job, but I found that doing it under running water works great and there is no dust or mess.Cons:Didn't pick up things as well as my old vacuum cleaner. Didn't have any of the extensions gadgets I really needed to get behind things or in corners. After using it for just over a year I got that funny burnt motor smell and it died completely.I guess it's not bad if you have a small place and no kids or pets, but for anything else I wouldn't recommend it."
1,waste of money,"I bought this vacuum after researching for about three weeks after my Hoover died. Mind you that I do not own another vacuum and didn't vacuum for three weeks. I should also mention that I have two kids under the age of four and two indoor cats that shed all over. The day I received the new Bissell, I quickly put it together and vaccumed the entire house- all 1200 square feet of carpet. The dirt cup wasn't even half full. My old Hoover would be full after just one room so you can imagine my disappointment since this vacuum got such rave reviews here on Amazon. My recommendation- don't waste your money on this vaccum. There are definitely better ones out there."
4,wonderful vaccuum cleaner!!!,"I did all my research on ALL the websites I could find in order to get a good vacuum cleaner at a resonable price. First Of all I LOVE the bagless part of it, and the fact that I can actually SEE the dirt and dust in the vacuum...secondly, it's sooo easy to put together. I was so excited when I got my vacuum! The only thing I did have a problem with was that when I saw it on the amazon website where it says ""watch it in action"" I was fooled by the video where it shows that a part is removable and it becomes a handheld vacuum. I was disappointed that I didn't get that one and I felt that the site wasn't clear on letting me know. Other than that, Happy cleaning for me now!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this vacuum four months ago after reading numerous reviews. The first couple of times that I used it, I loved it. It felt like it was self-propelled, did a good job on my carpets (two German shepherd dogs) and is VERY easy to clean.However, the suction hose has terrible suction, it won't pick up ANYTHING unless the hose is right over top of it. And when I turn the vacuum on after dumping the canister, dust particles shoot out from either the front or the side (I can't tell where it is coming from). Also, dog hair gets trapped in the top filter and I have to pull it out with my fingers even if the bottom canister is empty. I had high hopes for this vacuum based on the reviews now I'm ready for a different vacuum."
1,Junk!,"I had this vacuum over a year now, and I hate it.One of the first things I noticed was that the motor wasn't powerful enough to keep the roller spinning over carpet. The roller stops if the carpet level changes any. Within the first month the roller broke and I paid $17 to replaced it. It still gets caught on carpet. Not only that but it doesn't fully sweep in a track. By that I mean you can see the lines where it misses. You have to go over, and over, and over to get everything up.It's also very heavy. The tubes are way too short and the hose pops off all the time. The filters get clogged awfully fast and I have to wash them every 5 vacuumings. The suction spits kitty litter out the back. It's loud and noisy. The cord is too short.The whirlwind action in the receptacle cup doesn't work and dirt flies up into the filter clogging it. Just the other day the carpet height level mechanism completely broke off!!"
5,Big Bang for your Buck,"My old vacuum recently died (a slow painful death), so I was forced to get a new one. I was afraid if I didn't hurry up and get one it might become my Mother Day present. After many hours spent online researching all the models that are out there, I decided to give this bagless Powertrak a try. It seemed to have a lot of features that much higher priced units have (HEPA filter, 15 in. cleaning path, deluxe stretch hose, headlight, etc.) When it arrived I couldn't wait to get it out and use it, as my house went about 10 days without being vacuumed. It was very easy to put together and I was vacuuming within minutes. It performed as I hoped it would. Powerful, lighteight, and fairly quiet. The hose is really nice and stretches a long way, which worked great for cleaning the stairs. The dirt cup is very easy to empty, and I was shocked at how much dirt and dust it picked up. This vac is definitely deserving of a 5 star rating."
2,Bissell 35931 Not so great,"I am not all that happy with the Bissell 35931. The actual vacuum to me, has'nt any umph or power. It does alright vacuuming low carpet, but regular carpet, forget it! And hardwood floors or linoleum, you better be wearing shoes. Because if you are bare foot, your feet will have a nice loofa scrub from the back fire. As for the hose, the suction is awful and hardly picks up a thing. You have to be right on top of the object to pick it up. And the hose does not come with an upholstery attachment. Not worth the money. I am returning my 35931. Thank You."
1,This is a crap!!!!!!,"I couldn't believe it. May be the earlier reveiws were biased, or someone purposely did so to boost this one. This is totally powerless, and couldn't even suck what my 5 years old hoover does. I am really not gonna go by any ratings found on this site now."
2,Not really a book on followership...,"I bought this book based on the few available resuorces on followership thinking it may offer insight, or in the least, an introduction. I cannot, however, concur with the other reviews. I found the book to be dry and very limited in its discussion of followership. The focus is the continuum between leadership, management, team work, aupervisor, protege, mentor and follower. While this concept in itself is of value, the book really was not what the title promised nor did it leave me pleased with my selection. Even the focus of the book, the continuum between leadership and followership was lacking.These other options are available;* Followership: How Followers Are Creating Change and Changing Leaders by Barbara Kellerman* The Art of Followership: How Great Followers Create Great Leaders and Organizations by Ronald E. RiggioThis is where I will now focus my attention."
4,Taking Personal Responsibility to Lead.,Dr. Seteroff's work is a wonderful reminder that each of us is personally responsible for taking leadership. Gone are the days when leaders are respresented by the top of the organization's hierachy. Through our passion and by taking personal responsibility we demonstrate the true principles of leadership. This work is quite accessible to all employees and a terrific addition to current training and development efforts aimed at helping every worker understand and apply leadership and followership practices.
5,"Excellent book, will buy others!",Jason provides great information in his book. I've read my copy several times! This guy knows his stuff and its great for people interested in protective magic.
2,NOT User Friendly,"This book is not user friendly at all. In order to really get the most out of it, I am going to have to learn how to pronounce all the Latin he's included, which I just don't have the time for."
4,Protection & Reversal Magic,"If you think that you are cursed, you probably are correct! Mysterious illness, terrible mis-fortune, invisable spirits, demons and entities wrecking havoc in you home. Or even an evil entity attached to you. Someone also may have hexed you with goofer dust, hot-foot powder, a gris-gris or other cursed charms hidden somewhere in your home or on your property. Even grave yard dirt or cursed water blown or sprinkled on your clothing or in your face! Then check out this book! It is full of counter spells and explainations as to who or what is cursing you and how to stop them!"
4,An Excellent Manual,"This book is an excellent guide to metaphysical self-defense. It is quite extensive in scope and contains some old wisdom and new innovations, presented in an understandable way. It's comprehensive and holistic approach to spiritual health and defense is valuable knowledge for any occultist or magical practitioner, and this is the best source I can think of."
3,Good for the first year and a half,"My Dad had bought me the N2 about 1 1/2 years ago and I fell in love with the camera. It took great pictures. A great point and shoot camera. But, that was it...a great point and shoot camera. In the video recorder mode you can only zoom in before you start shooting not during. Thumbs down. Also, the flash always bothered me. Three flickers and then it shoots...way too much flash. Other than that, it was awesome. Until, about a week ago my camera went blank. Now whenever I turn on it beeps and the message ""turn the power off and on again"" come on. I do what it says and nothing happens, just the same thing. I got to the point of calling Sony ,but I'm not going to pay $170+ to ""repair"" my camera. I would much rather buy a much newer camera with more megapixels and a lot more features, unlike the N2, for the same price."
4,Nice!!!!,"This camera is way better than my old 5MP camera. For its size, its very stylish and sleek. The 3inch size LCD makes it very appealing. It has alot of feautures. You can actually vary the picture quality from a 5MP to 10MP, which is great if youre planning to take alot of pictures. Picture quality of night shots are clear, no more dim, blurry shots like my old camera. Sony video quality is very good, very clear and sharp. The features of this camera far outweighs its cons thats why i am gave it a four.Here's the downsides. Its not cheap. Not many color preference. At certain angles and lighting the camera can appear silver to pink metallic. Extra pair of batteries can cost about $40. Only Uses Memory stick Duo card. Since its a touch screen expect it to get dirty so I suggest you get a screen cleaning kit."
4,Good camera but not exceptional,"I'm pretty happy with the camera but still can't understand how sony up to this point doesn't include image Stabilization, really lame of them, and the mode in high sensibility for low lights pictures it's not that good u can actually see noise on the pictures, also ehn using the flash a lot of pics turn out wiht the red eyes, even though the anti-red eye is on :/"
5,Sony Cybershot,Love it! I have taken many quality pictures with my Sony Cybershot. Easy to download on my computer to share with family.Thank You
3,Not as good as it could be,"I have been using this camera for 6 months. The screen size is great but the logic of navigation behind the touch screen is too complex: there are too many menus to select before getting the option you are looking for (for example, the delete function). The stylus pen is the first thing you lose and there is no standard USB connector on this camera : you have to use the cable provided with the camera which is cumbersome and you have to keep it with you when you go to see friends and want to show/copy your photos on their computer (unless they have a card reader compatible with the mini memory stick). When you zoom in a photo, there is too much ""noise"" in the photos, which is strange for a 10 megapixel camera. Before having this model, I've used a Sony Cybershot 7.2 megapixel which was far more intuitive to use and the photos taken offered a better quality."
2,"Functions are a joy, robustness is a bust","Purchased this camera for my wife, Christmas 2006. Have used it for a year, and as an easy to carry point and shoot, performance and picture quality have been exactly what expected.However, having used numerous Sony products, my wife and I seem to think there is an internal ""one year and a day"" self destruct sequence in Sony products.Specifically the lens does not pop out when turning the camera on. I have carefully pulled the camera apart, as I read somewhere that a grain of sand (?!?) can cause the mechanism to jam, but my cursory inspection didn't lead to any success (nor could I find any sand).So off it goes to our often used Sony service centre, which is a complete pain as we live in Bermuda, and it will involve costly Fedex charges etc..."
2,ridiculous interface,"I really hate this camera. Instead of storing everything on memory stick, sometimes the camera stores pictures in its internal 25Mb memory. At other times, it stores photos in its memory sticks. When I download pictures to iPhoto 06 on a Mac, it couldn't find all the photos in the camera. Sony tried to be Apple but did such a bad job."
2,This is a big disappointment,Terrible digital zoom. Picture become blurred once entered digital zoom. Optical zoom is good. Paying this amount of money on a camera which has only 3x optical zoom(since digital zoom is useless)is not worth.
5,Very User Friendly!!!,"I have had this camera about 6 months now and absolutely love it!!! It really is very user friendly. The quality of the pictures is out of this world good, and the video is top of the line as well. I have been truely satisfied with this purchase. For the money, you will not find better quality than this. My brother and I compared this camera to 2 other professional camera's that he had and after developing the photos we took, this camera won the test. I take it everywhere and when I don't have my camcorder I use the Sony video from this camera and it is great quality. The only thing I would recommend is to use a tri-pod when taking video and would probably be best when taking photos too. Also, I would recommend the HIGH SPEED memory stick over the regular one. The pictures are even better! Overall, I would highly recommend this camera over anything else other than the 12 mega pixel that is out now!!"
5,Incredible Images,"This is a great camera, especially if you like a simple point and shoot which you can carry anywhere. I think the image quality is great and the optical zoom works really well; as does the digital zoom, even though it is really unnecessary to use a digital zoom since you can achieve the same closeness by using the magnifying tool on your computer."
5,Nice Touch screen and quick delivery.,"I purchased the Sony DSC-N2 10mp camera about a month ago. I liked the features and the large 3"" LCD screen but I was a little nervous about the touch screen. However, after reading a few reviews that I would give it a try. The touch screen works great and the camera takes great pictures. It has a very fast startup and quickly saves the pictures without a noticeable delay even using the highest resolution. It has high ISO sensitivity and when activated takes great pictures in almost pitch black conditions. The menus are easy to use and allow quiet a bit of customization.The online ordering from Amazon was easy and the camera arrived in factory boxes within a couple days via UPS. I was very satisfied with my purchase!"
3,Essential Collection minus many,"I purchased this compilation hoping to find some of the long overdue rare tracks that have yet to be released. What I ended up with is a re-vamped edition of ""From The Top"". It is missing the instrumentals from ""FTT"" and has many extra album cuts. If it is an ""Essential Collection"" then where's ""Honolulu City Lights"", ""Beechwood 4-5789"", and the jems that were released on the ""As Time Goes By"" CD. In the booklet they show all their LP/CD releases including ""As Time Goes By"". Last I knew it hasn't been released in the USA. I would have liked to see such titles as ""The Rainbow Connection"" or ""Leave Yesterday Behind"". Instead the American people only get a greatest hits compilation while the Japanese get all the recordings. Not fair at all. Also the version of ""Solitare"" has always been the same on every collection. I would rather have the original 45 version which is different than the LP. If you have ""From The Top"", this isn't much different."
5,Perfect for my Carpenter's Loving Father,"My dad was so surprised that the songs went back to 1965 -- With this, it had a book of lyrics and background on the songs -- What a fantastic gift for anyone who loves the Carpenters --"
4,"a mirror reflection of From the Top, yes, but.......","i am a huge carpenter fan too. i own the from the top box set myself. other reviewers have seemed to knock this release, some even before they have heard it. i dont have this version yet. i have learned over the years, that richard keeps fine tuneing there songs until they sound the very best they can sound. with todays technology, i dont blame him for using that in his favor to get the songs to sound as clean as possible. richard is doing the best that he can with whatever songs that were left behind from karen. i have noticed that on carpenters singles 1969-1981, a big carpenter fan can hear differences in the now versions and the then versions. perhapes that is the way with this collection. maybe the tracks have been tweeked a little by richard to sound even better that the first release back in 1990."
2,You can skip this set if you own FROM THE TOP boxed set,"The Essential Collection was reviewed in the 11/2/02 issue of Billboard magazine. Here is some of what was said...""there's not much here that hasn't been heard before. It would have been fun to include outtakes and alternate arrangements instead of packaging the hits yet again, since most followers likely already have one of the numerous collections previously issued (in particular, the 1991 boxed set, From The Top, which is awfully similar to this one).""This echoes what the music fan from Somerset MA said."
3,Like the AvP series,"I knew what I was getting into when I purchased this set. I saw the original AvP and thought it was not academy award winning great but a good popcorn flick on Saturday night and it did not disappoint. I thought the story had merit as a standalone product sans the Comic Lore. Paul W.S. Anderson did a good job moving the story along and the ending was good.The second movie AvP Requiem, I also knew what I was getting and generally was not surprised by what I saw. The only thing that did surprise me was how DARK this movie was from a lighting standpoint. I did not remember it being like that when I saw the dvd version. As other reviewers have said, it did diminish the movie enjoyment since it was very hard to see in some scenes what was going on. As much as I like ambiance, the Strause Bros either dropped the ball on this one or the picture transfer was gosh awful. I could deal with the story but the picture totally killed the fun out of this movie."
4,AVP Blu-ray!,"The first one is definitely better than the second, but I did enjoy both of them. Blu-ray looks great. There is a lot of action, killing, and cool special effects. If anyone is a fan of either franchise getting these movies is definitely a plus and would recommend them."
3,could be better,THE MOVIE SHOWS CLEAR BUT THE EXTRA SCENES ARE BLURRY - CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN THAT IT'S USUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND. WAS DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT
4,"Yeah, It's great!","I watched thoes two movies with 92"" wide screen + Projector(SONY VPL-AW15).Visual was very detaild and visual effects were great.I enjoyed watching two movies for several hours.If you are a fan of ""Predator"" or ""Ailen"", don't miss it!"
2,movie review,"It was OK, I probably would have not bought it if I seen it in the movies. It was filmed very dark and hard to see. I liked the first one better."
3,Collection complete,"These movies are generally not that good...but i'm a collector. I have all the predator and alien movies on blu ray. If you're a completionist like me, you need to snag these..."
3,Liked it because I'm a fan!,"I like the Predator movies and have the collection of all three. This twin pack is OK, but a little cheese-E. Bought it because it was cheap, but the acting and story line are not great. Would not recommend these unless you are a true fan of Predator or Alien movies. The Blu ray is or course awesome. One line in the Requiem movie to look for is [ the government wouldn't do that would they?] Like I said CHEEZ-E."
5,Algo que debe mencionarse,"Algo que no dice en las caracteristicas del producto, es que se encuentra en 3 idiomas y no solo en 2, me refiero al idioma español, español de latinoamerica y no el español de españa."
2,AVP 2pack,The second AVP was even worse than the first. What they have done to these 2 franchises is one of the most disappointing things in the movie business.
5,AVP DVD Movie,"Kids loved it... and I personally did not think it was as ""gory"" as others I have watched with them"
3,Alien vs Predator/Alien vs Predator Requiem 2 Pack,Though the story line for these two movies are substandard the special effects and presence th Aliens and Predators make it worth getting for any serious fan cinemas two deadliest and interesting monsters. The Blu Ray editions of these films are excellent and so definitely be part of your collection. Even if you didn't like them too much in the movie theatre give them a shot on Blu Ray as it adds that little extra something. I certainly enjoyed them.
3,A Plain Buy!,This packagae could have been so much better by just including the special editions of each movie but oh well. Overall a great two-set that will extend anyones likenesses for the films.
2,*sigh* could have done so much more,"watched the movie last night.. I was looking forward to a good continuation of the last AVP movie, and as the film started , it began to look as though it maight deliver. Unfortunately, the story was compacted into so little time and no real development was given, I felt as though I had been handed a very pretty looking slice of cake that was all frosting, no cake. yeha, ok, the new critter looked good, but that is not a good enought reason for me to waste 2 hours of my life watching a film.. I need more substance, and frankly, after about 30 min. I was looking to go do something else."
3,AVP Unrated 2-Pack,"The first movie was great, but the second left me a little stunned that they would even attempt to make an alien/predator together. The creature looked foolish, kind of a spoof. Overall the movies were OK."
2,robot mode is laughable!,"This transformer is about as half-hearted an attempt at making a transfomrer as I can find. The robot mode looks OK at first but you soon realize it does not have any legs... there is no transforming parts below the waist. The legs are the bulldozer plow that flip to the ""feet"" and attach to 2 pegs on the sides of the grinder wheel. These 2 pegs move with the wheel and give the appearance it's walking when you push it along.Other than that the vehicle mode looks fantastic. The treads roll & it has a mechanism that pushes the bulldozer plow up & down a little. It has a few noise effects set off by different switches. And it comes with a minicon that can sit in the driver seat & hooks to his side to launch a missile."
3,Encouraging population growth,"The 8 billion people Ms. Postel talks about will surely be here come 2030. If we don't have enough water to grow the food they will need famine will be rampant throughout the Mid-East, Southern Mexico and Indonesia. So, Ms. Postel seems to think that drip irrigation and water sharing will prevent this event. When do we face the fact that the forced growth of corporate agriculture has already produced the disasterous growth in world population? And further increases in food production will only contribute to the problem. Stop the destruction of the great aquifers of the world; conserve our precious water, certainly, BUT remember that world population will never be put in balance by growing more food. Solutions to over-population are to be found elsewhere and must be vigorously promoted!"
1,POS,"Yea...I bought this one just like the guys above me. Same issues, static reception, crap quality. Even when I finally found a clean station, it got static when it tried to hit the base. Deffinetly save your money, I am returning mine."
2,If your buying this... you're pretty much buying it for the ipod charger..,Well I bought this product so I would be able to use my ipod in my car and I just did'nt feel like buying a cassette adaptor and a charger. (since the ipod's battery life isnt too long)Design: I thought the design was OK. The white cord matched your ipod. and the power adaptor had a blue light which didnt look too bad.Usage: This is not a plug-play device! You have to set your own channels! And even after finding a empty channel theres alot of static! I drive '04 camery and i realized that the radio antenna was integrated into my back windshield. So what i did was i dragged the radio channel input controller all the way back near the back seat in order to get less static... So i cant even say its AM quality.pros: it charges your ipod.. it doesnt look to badcons: one of the worst FM transmiters..So now i m just using this thing to charge my ipod. and i use a cassette adapator to listen to my music.
1,Really noisy transmitter,All static all the time. This transmitter is just lousy. There's all kinds of static and disk drive noise on top of the signal. Even in a rattly work truck the signal to noise ratio is unacceptably low. Don't even pay $1 for the Maxell product. I suffered with it a long time until a friend gave me a Griffin Road Trip. The signal from that thing is MUCH better plus it has a removeable module that allows sending sound output from my home computer to my home stereo.
4,Kodak Easyshare Digital Picture Frame,It was a gift that I sent. They said it was easy to set up and use.
2,"BIG FRAME, little picture...","Odd, Kodak has been doing this for years, and this is not what people want. The frame is maaassive, and the pictures therefore look small. It's slow to power on, no picture shuffle, no picture/video hybrid playback, poor wireless quality... In short, not living up to it's purported operation or quality. C'mon Kodak!"
4,Nice frame,"My husband and I bought this for his mother. It was easy to use and looked great. I'd been reading reviews and specs for many frames, and didn't find one in our price range (under $200) that had everything we wanted (good resolution, remote, black or wood frame (not white), picture cycling times including longer cycles of >5 minutes, etc.). The only shortcoming we found with this frame, which I knew going in, was that the aspect ratio was not the same as that of our camera, and that pictures would be cropped to fit. That's what happened, but it was fine. Few pictures suffered noticeably, and even those that would have been better uncropped were fine. I figure we always have the original to print or resize for the frame, if we want to."
2,Caution - no random viewing,"I bought this as a gift for the grandparents. Loaded about 800 pictures on an SD card and turned it on. The image is very nice. But I noticed that the first picture displayed was the first I added to the card.Hmm. Turned it off, then back on. Same thing.Then I looked at the manual (which is inside the box, obviously) where it says that pictures are displayed in the order added.Very bad!You'll never see the last 700 pictures unless you sit through the first 100, every time you turn it on.I took this back and bought a Westinghouse DPF-0802 which has a random display and nice image. I wanted another one of those but everyone is sold out.Just be careful if you get the Kodak and expect to see a different show each time you turn it on."
2,Frustrated!,"I just bought/received two of these and I've been trying to set one up for three hours now. Seems, although the pictures I've copied to an SD card are in JPEG format, this frame won't acknowledge the pictures I've taken w/my Canon and other digital cameras. Went to software to see if I needed to Sync it and the software doesnt recognize/acknowledge the frame (only cameras). Also, cant get Kodak picture transfer software to work to transfer files via computer/USB. The Kodak website contact/chat room is closed and, of course, there's no ""800"" number to call anyone either. Should have done more research before buying!"
4,Kodak EX 811,This frame is very cool. They have some bugs to work out as far as updating software and the ease of set up. Once we got through that the frame is very cool. It has features we did not even know about. It goes out to our Kodak Gallary and gets pics to play. You do not just have to get them from the PC. Lots of fun to have and use.
1,Junk!,"I expected more from Kodak. The stand on the back of the frame is flimsy and the frame keeps falling over. Also, its operation was quirky out of the box.I own some off brands that are better than this.Stay away."
4,"Feature packed, and wi-fi makes it awesome","I bought this frame for my mother-in-law to have with her so we could push photos of my daughter to her. This is done over the wi-fi, as kodak lets the frame pull photos from an online gallery that we can upload pictures to.Note however that I have seen this frame freeze up (just while being on and doing its thing), and thus needing a power-off-power-on cycle (no need to unplug, as there is a switch).For the price, feature packed!"
3,"Good Product, Needs Some Tweaking","Great color & clarity. Some problems with the wireless connectivity. Initially slideshow would not show pics faster than one per minute! After contacting Kodak customer service, performed firmware upgrade and improved to approximately 5 seconds. However, the slideshow still ""chokes"" frequently. Also, bottom of picture gets cropped off."
4,Great product!!!,"Great product! Excellent picture quality! Many nice features! However, the quality of pictures pulled over wifi from the Kodak Gallery is something to be desired. This is a result of settings on Kodak Gallery, not the frame. I don't regret the purchase, but did anticipate equal picture quality from all sources."
5,Kodak Easyshare Picture Frame - Great!,We bought this frame for my 79 year old mother-in-law as a Christmas present. It is easy to download pictures and the pictures are crystal clear to view through the frame. No issues here and a great present to give!
2,Misleading description.,"We returned the frame without even trying to load it. Very disappointed to see the frame opening was 8"" on the diagonal which makes it much smaller than a regular 8"" frame."
2,"Lot of Sex, a Little Bit of Horses","I honestly do not understand others' enthusiasm for this book! It can be summed up thus: A group of wealthy British show-jumpers spend most of their time sleeping with their grooms, each other's wives, husbands, friends, and then occasionally, they compete in show-jumping competitions. That's about it for the plot. The constant sexual conquest games get really boring after a couple of hundred pages. Actually, I'm being generous: I was turned off on them before the end of the first chapter! Nothing much else goes on in this book."
5,My Favourite Author!,"Jilly Cooper is the only writer whose books I will order with no hesitation, in hardcover, sight unseen, immediately upon announcement of their release. Some are better than others, but I love them all. Riders is absolutely marvellous - exciting, hilarious, outrageous - it's just about perfect."
2,Before You Invest,"Jilly Cooper writes extraordinarily well. Her characters are well drawn and, at first, worth the time. The horse world scenes are well-done and are what drew me to the novel in the first place. At last, an adult horse novel! Unfortunately, it became too ""adult"". Midway through the book are 300 pages of increasingly graphic and obscene sex, which continues until the author completely abandons plot and character, then tacks on an ending to what was an interesting story. The book involves a considerable investment in time and money. Before one spends either of these, be warned: ""Riders"" should come in a brown paper wrapper."
3,x-rated saddle club,"This book is much better than Cooper's ""Players,"" mostly because it has a plot and some hysterical scenes (designed to appeal to the reader's inner seventh grader). But it's basically every young adult horse book I've read, only with a terrifically horny English cast and an author who's allowed to use bad words and bad metaphors when it comes to writing sex scenes.Here are some very familiar characters to anyone who's ever read horse lit.Rich snobs who are outrageously nasty and get their come uppance - Check.Spunky, sassy young horse mad girls - who are basically National Velvet with a sex drive to rival certain species of rodent. - Check.Poor but gifted young trainer with a long festering grudge - Check.Throw in vapid assorted other characters, and you've got a book!Also, why does this author have such an obsession about making sure we know a character is overweight - to the point of using ""fat"" and its synonyms for pages on end? Just asking."
3,A reasonably enjoyable waste of time,"Talk about trashy, disposable & forgetable. There were times during the first half of the book where I really struggled to continue reading this as it was so bitchy & whiney. The second half of the book was more entertaining for me even though the author ensured that there were really no characters that I particularly cared about although Fen & Tory are OK. The reason you don't care about the characters too much is that everybody is so promiscuous. There's so much bedhopping, they don't have any morals & for the most part the characters in the book are pretty disgusting & conceited. However if you're after something light & sexy this might just tick the boxes for you."
5,"Sex, Horses and Competition!","This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down! The competition is at Olympic level with beautiful woman, incredible horses and the over dramatic jockeys to go along with it! The story is told from third person feature two main chracters, one being Rupert Campbell-Black; a captivating character, he's a well known showjumper and has a different woman every night until a fiery red head named Helen walks in to his life. Jake Lovell is a talented rider and horseman but was never given the chance to prove himself until he married Tory, throughout the story him and Rupert battle it out at competitions. The drama and twists never stop! You won't want to put this book down! A must read!"
1,Ripped off,The book was supposed to be new and it is not. There is writing inside the cover and wear on the edges on the book. Also on the back of the book there is a book fair sticker for 4 dollars and I paid $15 not including shipping. Good bOk but very disappointed with this seller.
2,Romance disguised as novel,"I was very disappointed in this book; from the rave reviews, I expected a good novel about international show jumping, this is not that. This is romance, sex, and good character-driven intrigue set in the world of international show jumping. The horses and the jumping world were in the background, but only really described when they reach the Olympics, after about 400 pages.All in all, not much about the sport, all about the sex lives of a few alcoholic athletes."
2,Left me saddle sore,"And aching. The book was overly long, the characters were simply too unbelievable, the dialogue was flowery, on the whole it lacked imagination and the sex scenes were flaccid in the extreme.Jilly remains the voice of sex starved, deprived and frigid, middle-aged middle England. Go out there, ladies, and get a man!"
5,Great content,I have a grandson that is ADHD and has ODD and bought these for the parents. Helps to better understand and handle situations
4,Bringing Out the Best in Your Child,Bringing Out the Best in Your Child is nicely put together in an easy to refer to format. A great reference book that brings optimism to most parental challenges.
2,"Not from the ""classic album under review"" series","i guess it's interesting a little, but not so much. it's dated too because it talks whether chinese democracy will be coming out (and of course it did years ago). it isn't put together so well - - and the second disc is really lame (especially the graphics). get the guns n roses books, not this."
4,"A brilliant recording, but...","The rarest thing in music is melody, or so I have been told. In this case, the Andante (2nd movement) of the Barber Violin Concerto is a gold mine.If I compare the recordings of Gil Shaham and Hilary Hahn, I come up with something I've noticed before: some musicians apparently think that hitting all the notes with perfect accuracy is all they need to do, while other musicians pour their emotion into the music, not quite ignoring the metronome but obeying the inner emotions of the music.Musicians of Type ""A"" may record the piano music of Debussy, but dismiss ""Clair de Lune"" as immature fluff. Musicians of Type ""B"" may devote long years to mastering the immature fluff.So this is what I find with Gil Shaham (performing like a classic type A) and Hilary Hahn, performing like a virtuoso type B. You might want to get both performances and judge for yourself; I found the comparison a very interesting lesson in music."
3,I am waiting for a movie version....,"The Lepage production has important attractions, such as great singing and an intriguing machine. Still, the overall result feels strangely conventional and even stiff, in spite of the fantastic visuals created occasionally by the interaction between the machine, the acrobats and the video projections. Lepage is a tremendous artist, but here he did not project a true director's insight into what the opera means. On the other hand, in spite of the great achievements that the Ring has inspired, I have always felt that theater technology remains insufficient to deliver Wagner's ideas. Perhaps George Lucas, Steven Spielberg or some other visionary director should produce a Ring on film, with a full array of cinematic special effects. I keep waiting for it! In the meantime, this production has been commented upon so much that true Wagner enthusiast will be curious to view it."
5,great production,"love this new production of the ""Ring."" Saw it at the met opera house and wanted to be able to view it at my leisure."
1,A Ring to be avoided,"I'm surprised that this production, which has gotten so many bad reviews from critics, is rating so well on Amazon. To me it was an overly traditional production void of any personality. It was empty, both figuratively of emotion and drama and literally with the stage set. I don't understand how it was marketed as spectacular and revolutionary when it was really boring and despite the gigantic Machine, quite a small production with not much going on.The singing is top notch but if you're not going to enjoy the visuals you might as well get yourself any other Ring Cycle. For now I recommendWagner: Der Ring Des Nibelungen [Blu-ray], with a similar projections approach but order of magnitudes better. If you're looking for the best of the best, getDer Ring Des Nibelungen [Blu-ray], easily the best Ring Cycle (at least until the L.A. Ring Cycle is filmed), or the Centennial Production if you can find it"
4,Good Recording of the MET Ring,This New Ring Recording is the one which any Wagnerian should watch.I LIKE THIS PRODUCTION and recommed to classic lovers.
5,does what it says,This Bissel Steam Mop does one thing and does it well. I cleans hard surface floors as stated. I bought this mop because I am sensititve to chemicals and because it is hard for me to lug buckets of water. It got off even stuck on dirt with minimal effort. The reusable pads washed well. You will however need to replace the filter periodically. The amount of water left on the floor is so much less than mopping with a bucket that the floor dries in quickly. I reccommend getting the extra pads so you don't have to rush to launder used pads.
1,leaks,"I got this steamer about a month ago. First time I used it , it was great. The second time I used it, it leaked water from the tank in the back, all over the floor, non stop. I thought maybe I didn't have it in correctly, so I checked it again, and again,and again. I have tried to use it several more times, (sucker for bunishment) and it still keeps leaking all over the place. For almost a hudred dollars, I expected it to work more then once."
3,Be Aware of inflated prices on the deluxe kit,"I have not used the product yet but it was very easy to put together. What I was not happy about was the breakdown on charges. I was charged 52.33 for the mop, 12.58 for 2 pads (can be purchased for under 10 separately) and 33.08 for the extended warranty. If I had known that I would have looked for a mop without the warranty. I never buy these extended warranties, in the end it is usually money thrown away and pure profit for the seller."
3,Cool product but...,This is a cool product but it&#146;s principally a floor cleaner. My boss at work got one of those new vapor steamers. It does the floors and the shower and the countertops&#133;and just about anything else you could ask of it. Most people don&#146;t know what vapor is. I never heard of it until recently. This site has a fun quiz that helps explain the difference: http://vapor-systems.com/products.htm
3,Shrinking mop heads,"After reading all the glowing reviews of this product, I bought this product and found that, in general, I agreed with all the comments. If you're not fanatic about how clean your floors are, it's a good, serviceable product that's convenient and easy to use. However, after washing the two mop heads two or three times, one of them does not fit back onto the machine, and the other went on only with great difficulty and a broken thumbnail. Replacement mop heads are available at $9.99 a pair at the Bissell website. This seems to me to be an exorbitant price for what are essentially disposable mop heads. When they're new, it's a challenge to put them on, and when they've been used and washed a couple of times, impossible even for a man's strong hands."
2,Vapor-steam cleaners,After much research on vapor-steamcleaners I purchased the Bissell steam mop. Being a teacher I wanted something that would clean my wood floors without chemicals in a short amount of time. Working full-time and being a full-time mom I wanted the best product available for a resonable price. The vapor-systems that are on the market are overwhelming. This product worked fine on my wood floors but I needed a more powerful unit for the tuff projects. I purchased a more powerful unit from vapor-systems and between my Bissell and vapor-system I am the cleanest home I know of! These are great products for the busy homemaker. I keep finding new ways to use my cleaners everyday.
2,"OK, but not what I had hoped for","I have ceramic tile that is textured, not smooth, throughout my entire house. The dirt really collects in the little indentations. This steam mop does an adequate job at best, as it does not remove the ground-in dirt nor clean the dirty grout. I find that I need to spritz a little ammonia/water sol'n on first then bend down and scrub the really bad spots with a scrub brush. I have two dogs and their drool hardens into a cement-like substance that even repeated passes with this mop does not get up. I wish it had brushes on it as well, then maybe it would do the job (and save my back). It is about as powerful as a steam iron, taking many slow passes. It takes a little longer than regular mopping but doesn't push around dirty water like mops do. This steam mop is just slightly better than a regular mop."
1,Quit working,"Worked OK for about a year and just quit working---water heats, but does not work. Cheaply made"
4,Good Clean,"I received the Bissell steam mop as a gift. Okay here goes! I do like how well it cleans. My hardwood floors were spotless which I loved. The tile floors in the bathroom were spotless as well. The only drawback that I had was the steam mop is a little heavy. By the time I finished steam mopping my floors, I had a huge blister on both hands. My hands were actually sore for a few days. I guess that is what you call a ""Good Clean."" Other than that I really like it and will continue using this in the future."
3,Hard to maneuvre,I found that this item was difficult to push around on a bare floor. It left hair on the floor(even though I used the Catch-All 2x) Was heavier than I expected. I would not buy it again knowing this problem.
4,works like a charm,"I am really happy with this item-it cleans my tile and hardwood floors very well and the drying time is minimal. I would say the floors are dry within 5 min or less. This is great when you have lots of animals and kids ready to run back across them. It totally eliminates the need for buckets and chemicals too. The only reason it is not a a 5 star rating is because my arm gets tired of pushing it across the floor. It doesn't glide easily--probably this helps it get up more dirt, who knows?"
2,Hasn't held up well,"I LOVE the concept and how clean it gets the floors (I especially like how it cleans without detergent), BUT I've been using this floor cleaner for less than a year, and it's already breaking. The water squirter has completely stopped working, and it constantly leaks water. Now I'm researching a replacement. Great idea . . . I just wish they made one that was more durable."
5,Love it.,"This steam mop is so easy use and it works great. I can't believe it! One of the nicest features is noise level. It is so quiet.I will use it for both quick jobs (around the high chairs, etc) and a full floor cleaning.My only regret - I should have ordered replacement covers."
5,FINALLY!!,"I have been dreaming of an easy way to really clean my hard floors for so long! I purchased this item with the firm belief that it probably wouldn't clean as well as I wanted. But, since I like all my Bissell products, I was willing to give it a try.Oh my gosh. I honestly feel as if I could eat off my floors now. The Steam Mop really works as well as is claimed."
1,"disappointed, doesn't last","We bought this for the pergo floors in our breakfast area & kitchen. Not that big of an area really. We dusted the floors before using this, when it worked it was fine.However, the whole unit just clogged and burned up.The pads wear out quickly, had holes by the 2nd use.The unit lasted about 9 months, we only used it once (sometimes twice) a week. I expected more use than 9 months.Would not buy it again."
2,Fair,I like the trigger to release steam but I found it releases too much water. Had to wipe up very wet spots with a rag.
5,Not much to say...,"...except how wonderful this is. My hardwood floors have been so difficult to clean, but it's a cinch now. It's all been said in the previous reviews. This electric mop is great.I see they don't have it available any longer...I hope it hasn't been discontinued, because I've recommended it to about ten people who want to buy it!"
5,Steam Mop Sizzles!,"This product is fabulous. It is simple. It works as described. I have white tile with white grout and sealed hardwood. The first time I used it, I could not believe the amount of dirt the mop head picked up from my ""clean floors"". I changed the soiled terry cover about halfway through, as simple common sense would dictate. As with ANY mop, you MUST VACUUM FIRST. This is basic housekeeping knowledge. If you expect this mop to carry away large debris, forget it. Buy a vacuum cleaner or hire a housekeeping service."
5,SUPER MOP,I LOVE THIS THING I HAVE TRIED EVERYKIND OF MOP OUT THERE AND THIS IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE EVER SEEN IT GETS YOUR FLOORS VERY CLEAN I HAVE 2 KIDS AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO TO A FLOOR WITH THE SPILLS AND FOOD AND OF COURSE THEY DONT CLEAN IT UP I GOT SO TIRED OF SCRUBBING MY HEART OUT .IT SAVES LOTS OF TIME AND VERY LIGHT .
4,Do I need this?,"I wanted this so bad! Now that I have it I'm not sure if it's neccesary.I don't have a hard time attatching the cloth on the bottom like other reviewers. It doesn't have to be perfect to stay on. The steamer came with two and I ordered two refills so I can change them as often as I want(kitchen, bathrooms, and entries get there own rag) That's just my preferance(my little guy crawls the floors, occasionally licks(:My tile is very clean when I'm finished(only elbow grease cleans the grout) I enjoy seeing the soiled rag when I'm done.I feel like the abundant steam is hot enough to kill germs.It quickly softens dry baby food.And I don't want to go back to wringing out mops, and sticking my hand in dirty water to release the drain-gross!"
1,Junk,"Do not bother this thing is the worst representation of a product I have bought. Worked enough to clean or attempt tp clean my floors three times and I had it 2 months, this actually deserves -2 stars."
1,Not Worth It!!,"To start off, I would not even give this 1 star, but I have no choice!! I bought this 1 year ago and only used it 2 times. It made more work for me and did not clean anything. I have tile floors in the kitchen, laundry room and bathroom which is not smooth and all this thing did was put steam on the top. After going over it 6-7 times and nothing but alot of water, I had to get down on my knees and clean it. Also, it does not get very hot which I was told it would do. So for the last year this thing has been hanging in the garage, but this Thursday, it will go into the trash. Total waste of money."
3,Better for light cleaning,"This steam cleaner wasn't the high traffic, deep cleaner that I hoped it would be. It's better for just light cleaning on a flat, non-tile floor...not so easy to use on ceramic tile and doesn't do a good job on the grout. Easy prep and cleanup, but just doesn't do the job I bought it to do."
1,Piece of garbage,"I tried it on my sealed hardwood floors, as it suggests - it ruined the finish in spots. Perhaps it works on other surfaces but skip it for wood floors!"
3,Not as good as I hoped.,"I have an unglazed tile floor which has always been a problem to keep clean. I really hoped this steam mop would solve the problem as I have had professional cleaners use steam. For my floor, this is not the answer. Perhaps not enough steam. I do better with a mop and bucket. For fast touchups it's fine but not proper cleaning."
3,Neat Product But Not For Serious Jobs,"I can't say anything bad about the Bissell Steam Mop because it is a neat product. But my neighbor recently introduced me to vapor steam cleaners and there is quite a difference. Like the steam mop, vapor steam cleaners clean and sanitize (even deodorize) without using smelly and unsafe chemicals. But the TPA Vapor 2000 my neighbor let me try is light years ahead in terms of cleaning power and resilience. So I ordered one online from vapor-systems dot com. I still use my steam mop for simple things. But when I have some serious filth to clean up, nothing beats Blue Boy (what my kids call our Vapor 2000)."
1,Very Dissapointed - Pass on this gadget,"This item is very limited. Left a dull finish on my floor, is hard to push and manuver because of the swivel head. Kinda sticks to the floor. Get the floor mate in stead - works a lot better."
3,Okay But Only Cleans Floors,I read the reviews here and decided to order a vapor steamer from Vapor-Systems because I wanted something that cleans more than just my floors. My Vapor Steam Vapor Vac just arrived and I love it. Can't think of anything it won't clean. And the water filter vacuum is fantastic. Works wonders on my mattress. Goodby dust mites! Thanks for helping. The Steam Mop is good too. But only for floors.
5,Great!,"Pros: Lightweight, no chemicals, easy to use, picks up spots, washable mop cloths, heats quicklyCons: Could have a longer cord and more cloth padsThey shipped me a tea green steam mop with white mop pads. Even though the picture shows a white steam mop... still works! :)Plug it in, wait 30 seconds, light turns on, squeeze the trigger for water (you don't have to constantly squeeze). This machine should be quite. Mine makes noise until the water fills inside (takes a few seconds). Hold the trigger with the machine vertical for a few seconds until the water chamber fills and then it won't make any noise.Great product! No more mop and bucket!"
5,Great product!,"I am so pleased. Easy to use, fairly long cord, nifty swivel head gets in all the corners and under edges. For stubborn spots I just jet it steam a little longer and they came right off. Floor drys really fast also. So simple, just grab it, pour some water in and it's really ready in 30 seconds. When you're done, just drop the mop head cover in the laundry and put a new one on."
3,"Ok for basic upkeep, not deep cleaning.","I got this steam mop recently and I really like it. I'll be the first to admit... no, it does not do deep cleaning well. But, what it IS wonderful for, is the basic upkeep of the floor. I find that now I only need to REALLY mop once a month, and use the steam mop in-between. It is quick and easy to use, and gets the job done. Plus, then when I do the deep-cleaning, it's not so hard to do because I've kept the mess in check with the steam mop. Bottom line, (as with any tool) if you use it regularly it will make life easier. I'm not a gadget person at all, but this is one of few tools I really am willing to use on a regular basis."
4,"Good for hardwood, but you may want to keep your mop","This is a very convenient tool and certainly gets that last bit of dirt everything else might leave behind. I know that my floors are clean after I am done with this, so I can recommend the item. I only give four stars for two reasons:1- Getting the terry cover on is a pain. Takes several tugs and the pull string thingy doesn't work very well.2 - It doesn't leave floors with that shine that you get with murphy's soap and you have to go over some spots with a towel because you get water droplets that, if left to dry, cause spotting."
1,Stopped working just after warranty ended,I've owned the steam mop for just over a year. I loved this cleaner until it stopped working one day. It showed no signs of wear until it just stopped working. I will not be buying another Bissell
4,Trancers Collection,"If you enjoyed them before, you'll still like them. Number 3 is still the low point but 4 and 5 are redeeming."
2,In this case my opinion is fact.,"The sound suck and the picture's crap. But it's nice to finely have the collection. i wish Charlie Band would put some money into this to do the collection justice. This deserves 5.1 and a great picture for DVD and Blu ray. Or atleast sell the rights to a company that can afford to do this cause it looks like crap on my HD tv, but it's not so bad on an old box tv."
1,Fullscreen is garbage,What a rip-off!!!!!!!!!! I paid almost $300.00 for this set!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My wife is gonna kill me!!!!!!!! Furry and brown monkeys will soon dominate our planet with ray guns and apple juice!!!!! Run for your lives!!!!!!!
3,This movie is not bad but I only give it three stars........,"This movie is ok, but I only give it three stars. I seen it back in the early 1980's and liked it then, but after rewatching it now, it does not seem as appealing now. However, the seller did a really great job getting it to me on time and I would order from them again."
4,Great Movie,"Just watched this movie for the second time. The last time I saw it was five years ago in college. I thought it was even better the second time. Let me start by confessing I have not read the books, so I can not present such a critical review as others, but maybe that is for the better. If you want to see a good enjoyable movie then this stands on its own quite well. In an age of countless blue screens and special computer effects lets take a minute to remember when a great movie like this could be made with ""real"" people, minimal action, and (god forbid) subtitles!"
3,very disappointing,"I loved the book, and know it cover to cover because I've read it so many times. I saw this movie and I just had to rent it. I thought it would be interesting to see how someone else saw it. I was severely disappointed. They didn't do a very good job at all. It still made me cry, but I would never, ever rent again. If you intend to make the other movies, invest in it more. Pay attention to the book. Perhaps read it first. There is so many mistakes, and scenes put together it just wasn't worth the $.47 I paid to watch it."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I have read all 5 of the ""Earth Children"" series, which are wonderful books. Jean Auel is one of the best writers I have ever read. I've read the complete series at least 6 times and look forward to the 6th and final book. As for the movie, it may be the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen. In my opinion, an hour and a half simply isn't enough time to capture the true context of the story. Perhaps after the 6th book is released another try at a screenplay should be made. Maybe a mini series would be appropriate so there would be enough hours to convey the story line properly. To be fair to the attempt at a recreation of the story in film, the effort was there. I think with the modern special effects this could be a well made movie. Even though the movie was a disappointment I still love the series and learned a great deal about the ancestors of our time from Jean Auel."
2,Tom's review was classic!,"As a deep and true Auel fan, I was embarrassed for the movie, even, as they say, for a part played by Darryl Hannah. How do you *do* a movie like this effectively? Hollywood, I have to give you credit for trying, but I vote that it didn't hold a candle to the book. Still trying to get her latest novel! Thanks, Tom, from a tall blonde! How hysterical!"
2,now I understand why it was 3 dollars,I bought this movie because I was reading the series and was interested to see what it would be like. It just isn't good... whether you've read the books or not. I watched it once and definitely won't be watching it again.
4,Clan misunderstood.,This is a wonderful story/film. The people who read the book and then went to the film version probably enjoyed every moment of the film. Those that went to see it cold turkey were most likely bothered with the subtitles. We that read the book did'nt need to keep looking from the film to the subtitles and back. We knew what was going on. I'm very disappointed that the next two books were not also made into films. But I understand why.
1,Very Poor,"If you hadn't read the book, the movie would mean almost nothing. If you have read the book, you will understand the very poor and sketchy story. It was a great book but watching the movie was a waste of time."
1,failed attempt,"Avoid this movie which not only has no interest in itself, but is also a really poor attempt at showing life in the iceage.If you loved the books, get yourself ""Quest for fire"": the story has nothing to do with Jean Auel books, but the spirit is there."
2,They tried but failed,"I loved the book this movie is based on. I thought it fit pretty well with the story. However, a couple major aspects made it painful to watch. The movie attempted realism but completely disregarded major things.All the women had shiny and freshly shaved legs. This was a large distraction from the period the directors were trying to create.Also, there was too much of a sense of the 20th century. The characters movement was at times very modern as was the quality of speech.The directors could have done a much better job with the period."
3,"Interesting, but not at all like the book","The book was excellent, and, in fact, one of the best books I have ever read. I understand the temptation to make a movie of Ayla's adventure, but the challenge of putting the nuances of the book to film was too difficult. Next to impossible to absorb information about the neanderthals (clan) -- no movie could match the excellence of the book. If you read the book, it is fun to watch, but if you haven't, I don't see how you would be able to understand what was going on. It was confusing, and difficult to understand. I do believe, however, it should not be judged too harshly because it was a very difficult task to put such a story to life. I recommend it for people who have only read the book first."
2,buy the book,"I give it two stars because, they tried. but this movie pales in comparision. If you've already read the book just don't bother."
2,Too Short,"I was initally exited to find that they had made a movie for the Clan of the Cave Bear books, but i was expecting it to follow into the next few books in this story. I was a little disappointed when it just dropped off when she left the Clan, it would have been a better movie if they had incorperated all the books."
2,NOT GOOD!,"If you havent read the book, don't bother watching film. I have read all the Earths Children books and was really looking forward to the movie only to be very dissapointed. It didn't follow the book and was a little confusing. I think it should be re-made with todays technology."
3,Somewhat disappointed.,"Case had some scratch marks and so did the DVD. It did play without any problems, though I had expected it to be in better shape Delivery was very fast."
3,vivid descriptions,"Loved her detailed writing style that made it easy to visualize the lost world of the Neanderthal. Although I rooted for Alya the whole time, she just seemed too perfect. Maybe that was just in comparison to those around her. I would recommend it."
4,great movie !,I felt as if I was actually there living amongst the clan of the cave bear.Daryl Hanna did a great job playing her role.
3,Clan of theCave Bear,"I think this movie was ok, nothing great though. It started out good, explained the background of the story, and pretty much followed the book.However the more it went on, the farther from the book it got, and at very key parts, it was totally changed.The book is excellent, the movie is the complete opposite."
3,"Great Movie, Lame Disc","The Clan Of The Cave Bear, based on a novel by Jean M. Auel, is movie that became a product of its time. While following the plot of the book up to a point the film breaks away about halfway through. The movie became a story about social change and female vs. male values. Also, the movie had to drop most of the details and events that the book has, just to keep from becoming a six hour epic.I saw the movie before reading the book, so while I have to say the book is better I do have a place in my heart for the movie. Watching it now, after learning so much about life, Neanderthals and early man, I can't help but find it sometimes funny and sometimes sad.While the movie is one that really changed me and is a great piece of motion picture history the DVD has no extras. No photo gallery, no commentary, nothing to add to it. So while I say the movie is a great one (a view many would debate) I can't hide how unhappy I am with the disc as a whole."
3,NEVER RECV'D THE MOVIE,"SELLER INDICATED THE MOVIE WAS NOT IN GOOD CONDITION-AND DID NOT SHIP, AND DID NOT HAVE A REPLACEMENT."
1,"A wonderful book, disappointing film","How can I count the ways that this movie is disappointing? First off - the main character in the book starts off as five years old and at the end of the book is about 14...Daryl Hannah is beautiful but way way too old to play the part of Ayla. That is the most obvious to me. When this movie came out I was excited because this is one of my favorite books of all time, but I was bitterly disappointed...The book is so wonderful that it deserves a much better film representation than this one. I heard that Jean Auel (the author) got the movie rights back, so maybe someday we will see a better effort on this story and the other books in the series. Personally, I think that this is a story that would be better animated, especially with the Pixar process...I thought of that when I watched ""A Bug's Life"" with my nephew."
1,Worst film ever!!!,"This was the worst movie based on a book I have ever seen! I love the Earth's children series and was very excited when i found out Clan of the cave bear had been made into a movie. I was very disapointed! The film makers involved took a great story and ripped it's soul out. They butchered very important story lines, and the Characters were badly directed. What was left was a poor excuse for a story. After wasting 90 minutes of my life on this film all i could do was BEG for it back!!!"
1,Almost as good as Planet of the Apes,This film is visually pleasing. It has many great shots of natural scenery in northwestern Canada. Drawn out and boring. Recaptures your attention when it's unintentionally funny. Quest for Fire is a much better film in this genre.
5,Clan,Another difficult movie to come by for my collection. Glad I found it and at a reasonable price too. Trouble is i lent it out and have not gotten it back yet.
4,Couldn't get it to play,"I couldn't get the VHS to play, I had thought I purchased it on DVD but didn't . I still like the movie and did reorder it in DVD format."
4,"Almost, but not enough....","This movie followed the book in a vague way, but where it followed--it was true to details. The only regret was that the entire book was not made into a full-length mini-series and follow the book more specifically. I have enjoyed reading all 5 books of the series, look forward to more books and would love to see another movie made of one or all of the rest of the books. I watched this movie many years ago after the first book came out and recently purchased it to watch again. As I have read the books, in my mind's-eye, Ayla looks just like Daryll Hannah!!!"
3,Clan of the Cave Bear (VHS),"The movie was well done, I recognized certain parts from the books that I have been reading. However, if I had not read the books it would only have general meaning for me. But having followed the main Characters, I found it very interesting to see how the people in the movie looked & acted compared to what was in my mind when I was reading that 1st book. It is not a movie I probably would see again, but I passed it on to our local library for their collection & they were happy to get it! This is not a movie to be watched while multi tasking, it demands your attention."
5,"Glass Canopy, 30"" x 12""","Very good. Getting the back strip attached was a little tricky. However, the flexible back plastic is 10 times better than the hard plastic black hoods that come as standard."
3,Nice Shoes,The shoes look great and the GEOX system makes them ideal for using without socks. The only downer is the sole marks certain floors (vynil).
4,Bernstein a second time around...,"These four classics of Americana were recorded by a more youthfulLeonard Bernstein for Columbia/SONY back in the 1960's. No one conducts this music quite like him. I think his affinity for Broadway glitz gives him an edge on all others. Those older recordings(mostly with the NY Philarmonic)are still available today. Value wise you get him conducting and as soloist on the ""Rhapsody"". He conducts his own ""Westside Story"" with flair and even Copland has admitted that Bernstein is more diffinativeon ""Appalachian Spring"" than himself. You get a sumptious ""Adagio"" to conclude the album. All this at a bargain price and on one convient disc, recorded as DDD. Add a star if you think the wisdom of age triumphs over the vigor of youth!"
4,Excellent,"This album consists of recordings conducted by Karajan, one of the 20th century's best conductors, conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchesta, one of the world's best. The quality of the works is exactly what one would expect from such a combination - excellent. My only criticism is that, as the pieces were recorded quite a while ago (mostly in the 1980s), if they were digitally re-mastered the quality would have been slightly improved and reached a peak. Hence 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Is Voting Always Good?,"David Broder's new book is an outstanding example of what political journalism OUGHT to be. Unlike many political books, this is not just a tell-all rehash of conflicting personalities, but a thought-provoking assessment of an important issue that confronts the nation. Before reading this book, I naively assumed that ballot initiatives were inherently a good expression of the democratic process. Broder's book reveals how the process can be subverted by well-heeled special interests. I don't always agree with Broder, but he makes me think."
2,Dangerous Initiative?,"Broder presents the origins and history of Initiative and lays out many negative aspects pertaining to its modern practice, based on his own perceptions and conclusions. He apparently does not see any good aspects, now or in the future. A dim view indeed, as if it were not possible to improve the process at all.The most galling point taken by this reviewer is that Broder does not acknowledge that the people are sovereign and have the right to legislate directly, even if they do not always have the means or process in place to do so.This type of one-sided presentation could serve as a catalog of wrongs to be fixed and might be useful in that respect. However, the shortcomings of the Initiative process have already been addressed in the Direct Democracy Initiative proposal by former Senator Mike Gravel and the Philadelphia II organization. Broder mentions this effort but dismisses it based, apparently, on his foregone conclusion that Initiative is dangerous at all levels."
3,Tiny Optimus okay,"Optimus is okay, because to me it's easy, because my friend let me use his big optimus prime.And that why it is easyI give this toy a C+"
5,A great Prime for the money,"I grew up when Transformers were just hitting the scenes and have found the recent Generation 1 re-issues to be a great way to pick up the Transformers that I could never get as a kid. The re-issues also sparked new interest in collecting Optimus Prime in his many forms over the last near 20 years. I picked up this Optimus Prime in the store and was very impressed with it. It looks much like the $.. version without the trailer and a little smaller - still a great piece to display. He is very poseable, something the old Transformers lacked severely, and looks great holding the Mini-con transformed as his blaster rifle. All in all, a great buy, especially for a child that doesn't have $.. to spend on a transformer."
5,Bolero is a winner every time,Cannot review this CD with knowledge of its contents. I purchased this to give as a gift and have been told the recipient has enjoyed it tremendously.
5,Champagne or Sangria?,"Boulez isn't as dry a conductor or human being as some would like us to believe and is a conductor of choice for a lot of very different music, Wagner? Debussy, Ravel, Berg? Janacek?When will he do Brahms? Just kidding. Predictable results. Not a hard sell."
5,Superb Restoration!,Restored Serials has done it again!! A Top Notch Restoration. I only wish Columbia would let him restore all their serials
5,A place for everything?,"After moving from a country home with a country kitchen to a modern condo in the city, we found ourselves with no place to put any foodstuff.Where we used to have 3 walls of cabinets, we now had 3 cabinets. The mac and cheese packages couldn't just sit out on the counter!After looking for something that would fit in a small-ish space, yet hold a lot of stuff, (for ages, it seemed we looked) - we found this product. I put it together myself, with just a screwdriver. ALL of the pieces were accurately marked (!) and machined correctly (!!) so - although it was a time-consuming endeavor (about 4 hours of STEADY work), it was an easy four hours.Based on my experience, I've ordered other Home Decorator products and have been happy with all."
4,bookcase,"product is very nice looking, could of had better instructions for assembling the product. Quite not as sturdy as I thought, moresturdy after putting books on the shelves. Looks very unique and beautiful when completed.Very stylish looking"
5,The sweetest Bear,"This is a really cute bear. It is soft fabric. With the candy canes on the fabric randomly, each one bear is slightly different, no two bears have the candy canes fall in the exact same place. It is well constructed and has two ribbens, one red and one green, tied around it's neck. It has dark brown eyes (almost black looking) and a cute black nose. The nose is more of a triangle nose (more realistic) which is different than a lot of the noses by Ty which are more the button nose. It is a really cute bear."
5,ABSOLUTLY AWESOME!!!!!!,"I am a mother of a hyper active 3 year old and BUZZ is a true blessing in this house! This is the first toy my son has ever had that has kept his attention fully, and that is very hard to do with a hyper-active child! He is a big fan of Toy Story, itself, but this Talking Buzz is something else. It sparks his imagination, and that is so great to see! My son is very rough on toys, and the durability of this toy is great as well. I have not had any problems with it. I recommend this toy to anyone!"
3,"Doesn't say ""To infinity and beyond""","My 3yr old likes this toy but is disappointed that ""To infinity and beyond"" is not among it's recorded phrases, perhaps because it is the Toy Story 2 version. I suppose I will have to try to find one of the original toys on eBay. As far as durability, it seems OK, although I continually have to re-attach the helmet visor."
4,Great Toy!!,"I was thrilled to find this toy for my son. My only complaint...lol...is that Buzz only has 4 sayings and they do NOT include his famous, ""To Infinity...and Beyond!!!"" Otherwise...a great toy!"
4,This is actually good....,"Well, to be honest, I've never actually heard Patti LuPone's version....however, she's talented, so I figuere that it's good. I have heard the music before, I believe it was a very early cast recording on record. The songs are humorous and heartfelt, and you can't help but get them stuck in your head after you've heard them. In my opinion, the two best are ""Joe Worker"" and ""The Nickel Under Your Foot"". Check this one out, you may never have heard of it, but it's rather good."
3,Pros and Cons,"On the positive side, this suit kept me clean and dry during a very wet camping trip. The negatives were 1.) Sitting by and campfire led to the pants melting around the knees. 2.) It is not very durable as sitting on rough surfaces or walking thru brush caused tears in the suit. 3.) There are no pockets in the jacket. There should be! 4.) There are only through pockets in the pants. Who wants an opening to the inside on a rainsuit? Pants pockets would be a better option."
2,Fits like a Tent,"I purchased this rain suit after doing a lot of comparison shopping. I decided that for the price, it was a great deal, but it turned out to be a great disappointment. First of all, the material is very unusual looking for being waterproof. Think fortified paper towel. I didn't even bother to test how effective it was though because the jacket fit like a hot air balloon. The chest area was fine, but the sleeves were large beyond reason. Generous fit is one thing, but I probably could have fit my body through the sleeves. I had to send it back."
4,Good Jacket,"Purchased for trip to Alaska (in summer). Fortunately didn't have to use it much. Kept us dry, while being very light and easy to pack in a bag. Even with a small suit for me at 5'8"" 150lb, they are on the baggy/bulky side, but it does make it easy to throw on over sweaters and whatnot. Only complaint, is that when the hood is up you can't hear much cause of the crinkling around your ears... it's the nature of the type of material though, so you can't do much about that."
1,"Junk, with customer service to match","The very first time I took mine out of the package and tried it on, two of the seams separated. I used the contact form on Frogg Toggs' website to request a return authorization. They didn't respond. I then phoned the company. They gave me a second number to call. I left a message there. Once again, no response. I won't be buying any more Frogg Toggs products."
2,Nice and waterproof - until the zipper breaks.,"My husband had a pair of these and the zipper broke. I got ready to buy a good rain suit and thought it was probably just a fluke about the zipper. BUT - the third time I wore mine, the zipper on MY jacket broke.Loved them at first - they were lightweight and didn't make me sweat inside them, and they blocked wind and water. Shame about the zipper because it negates all the benefits!I won't buy anything made by them again."
1,Poor Design,"Used this vacuum once a week for three months and accumulation of debris was gathering in belt area of powerbrush. We didn't notice the problem until the vacuum produced a burning smell. Bissel tells me that this isn't covered under warranty if debris is caught in the belt area. They also recommend cleaning this area regularly which is only accessable with removing 6 screws and taking the powerbrush apart!I believe this is a poor design, the belt is place about an inch away from the outside edge of the roller. I had a Dirt Devil for 10 years and never had a problem.Bag sensor doesn't work.This will be the first & last Bissel I will ever own."
1,Don't waste your money,"This does NOT work on bare floors! The only attachment they give you is the power head and 3 dinky little brushes, no hard floor attachment. The powerhead has a barefloor option, when you use that option it scratches your floor terribly and is difficult to get in any type of area that dirt , sand or dog hair accumulate. The only way to stop the scratching is to raise the head to the carpet level and then nothing gets picked up. Don't waste your money!!!"
1,brand new doesn't work,"After researching vacuums online we decided on the DigiPro Canister 6900 vacuum. After we put it together and tried it we discovered that although the motor turned on, the brush didn't turn. We've taken it in for service and they've verified that there is a problem. Beware of brand new products that simply do not work."
1,"Unfortunately, this product does not SUCK.","When my upright vacuum died after I had replaced 95% of my carpet with hardwood, I thought a cannister vacuum would be a better choice. I have two other Bissell products (the Pro Heat 2X carpet cleaner, and the SpotBot) and have been happy with the performance of both. Unfortunately, the DigiPro did not live up to my expectations. There are some nice features, like the telescoping feature of the wand, and the unit is less noisy that the old upright. And I sort of got used to the heavy wand and the clunkyness of it. But now I find that the genuine Bissell vacuum bags have such a flimsy built-in gasket, that air leaks in at that point and there is no suction at the end. Bissell customer support was not helpful and are not aware of any problems. I will try to find the non-Bissell vacuum bags that I bought once before that had a stronger gasket, and save my pennies for a new vacuum that actually does suck."
1,Carpet attachment clogs easily,"The carpet attachment has clogged twice in the handful of times I've used it. The first time, I had to take off six screws to unclog. The second time, I managed to clear it with a long screw-driver and the wand was also clogged. My 15-yr old Hoover picked up better."
1,Poor quality,"This vacum cleaner has good suction and cleaning power, design is pretty good, but in our 2 year ownership, changed already:HoseTelescoping wandBelt and bulb for power brushNow the power brush connection is melted so it does not work, the hose is bad again. Parts are not cheap either so guess what not worth to change those again.Will probably buy miele since the price for this one and parts are already up there."
2,4 years later and VERY little suction,"I liked this vacuum when I first bought it... but I have a dog with medium length hair and the motorized head gets clogged very easily and loses suction quickly. The suction is okay if I stop vacuuming every 2 minutes to pull out balls of hair that get stuck at the turn between the motorized head and the arm. If you don't have pets, this may work for you... but BEWARE if you are expecting the vacuum to clean up dog hair."
2,"Reviewer has a good point, HEPA of very poor design","The Reviewer makes an excellent point! This unit will not provide HEPA filtration of exaust air. So if you are buying this unit due to allergies or based on the procaimed HEPA filtration you would do best to pass this unit up. However as a normal vacuum, the unit is very good. Due to its small size it is very easy to manuver through tight spots. Suction is very good as well as the power head. The hose is of poor quality and tends to kink, but all in all a good vacuum. They just shouldn't claim HEPA filtration as the previous reviewer (mictrik) has pointed out so well. These days it isn't hard to find vacuums with HEPA filtration so passing this unit up wont be to big of a loss. Fix this issue and Bissell would have a true star."
2,Bissell 6900 Digipro Canister Vacuum,I purchased this vacuum 5 months ago and it already is giving me trouble. The hose attachment to the canister does not stay attached and it does not have a floor brush making it difficult to vacuum around furniture. I would not recommend buying this vacuum. It is cheap plastic and I wasted my money.
4,It Broke,The first time I used it the hose came apart. Bissell sent a new hose and it's been working great ever since. The vacuum is super quiet and does a great job.
1,Misguided purchase-Didpro 6900,"This is the worst vacuum cleaner I have purchased in 30 years! The suction is poor, poor filter. I have enjoyed many Bissell products this one would be better smashed. The company had very few answers or suggestions. This will certainly direct my purchases elsewhere."
5,what a good dance/trance album should sound like,"Many listeners will jump at Fragma's Toca for the widely successful club hits Toca me and Toca's Miracle. However, those that purchase this album will be pleasantly surprised with the quality of the rest of the tracks. Although each track has a slight hint of Tocame in terms of the rhythm and sound, each song works with its catchy baselines and vocals. Comparing Fragma to another female generic dance group, Alice Deejay, the thing that I like more about fragma, is their variation of vocalists, and the subtlety of their compositions. While I feel Alice Deejay is strictly a more party oriented record, Fragma's smooth brand of dance provides for an equally enjoyable chill soundtrack fit for any mood. The tracks on this album are perfect top dance chart material, however don't expect anything groundbreaking- just a pure form of dance music that makes for a very enjoyable listen."
1,Waste...,Really teeny tiny little jar!!did not see any results..I absolutely will not be buying this cream!!It was a total waste of money and the cream in it last about 4 days
3,But can you understand it?,"From the crop circle/star glyph combo 16 - ""This is the triadular desectotron quadraphonic code for the deactivation of plutonium poisoning. This crystalline matrix will be imploded in the consciousness of a team of researchers that will be able to reduce plutonium's half-life to a transmugenative equatronic base that will detoxify radiation poisoning. That is the star gate that the information is coming through. The matrix that is the crystalline geode for this information frequency will be activated in to the consciousness of a team of scientists who are going to resolve the plutonium half-life dilemma. The crop circle is the crystalline matrix for this formula."""
2,Spellbinding,"Having read 'Crop Circles Revealed: Language of the Light Symbols' from cover to cover, I firmly believe that this is a work of almost flawless scholarship and accurate interpretation. The only fault I could find, albeit minor, is the obvious typo in the title; 'crop' should have been spelled with an 'a' not an 'o'."
4,Decent,"Got these for Christmas, the directions are not clear on which side to put the handles on, in fact they dont tell you at all. I put them on the wrong side so im kind of stuck with it, other than that its good. handles are stuck on nicely. its so clear i accidentally dropped some flakes on it thinking it would go into the water. would of been 5/5 if directions on what side you put the handles on were clearer."
5,crystal clear,I bought the tank canopy for a aqueron 55 gallon tank this tank is 48x13x20 and these fit perfectly. it comes with two canopys so you need to have a center brace on your tank. the lids are hinged in the middle and there is a plastic back piece that attaches to the glass.( so you can make cutouts for filters airlines etc) i also have the marineland double bright led which sets perfectly above the canopy. the canopy is crystal clear and let the light right in. these also come with two clear handles you may attach where you want.these are very nice lids and I would reccomend you check you tank dimensions first and then order some.
4,Understanding Modern Telecommunications and the Information,"Clearly explains the latest developments in the telecommunications industry to people who do not have a telecommunications background. Defines many key terms in simple easy to understand english and provides information into who are the key players in each telecommunications segment. This book covers the history of telecommunications, computers and the Internet, fiber optics, satellites, networks, and digital wireless. A good beginner book to give you a basic knowledge of the telecommunications industry."
2,Not good sourcebook for internet telecoms,"I'm very uncertain as to whom this book is aimed at. We get a map of the Vietnam-Thailand-Hong Kong undersea cable system, 4 pages on how Sprint's network operates but only 1.2 pages on how the internet architecture works (pages 186-7, that's it, unless I missed something).Also some of the data on the internet seems old. There is no mention of ICANN for example, which now runs IP address space allocation, protocol parameter assignment and root server system management functions (according to its website... Another organisation is named in this role by the book, the ""Internet Architecture Board"", however I believe this is now defunct or has been subsumed by ICANN - a search on Yahoo turns up nothing for this body.Disappointing as a sourcebook for internet technical knowledge. I think the book tries to appeal to too many audiences."
4,Chung's view is sharp and modernist,"Since he is such a good Shostakovich conductor, it's easy to anticipate that Myung-Whun Chung would take a bleaker, more angular view of Romeo and Juliet than most. His style in Prokofiev is ultra-clean, with sharp, staccato attacks in the winds, but slowing down quite a lot for the tender romantic sections devoted to Romeo and Juliet together.The result is different and for me a bit too mannered. Chung's slow pace doesn't seem danceable, for one thing, and the sharp attacks feel overly aggressive. Others disagreed when this album was released, and despite its short runnning time of aobut an hour (compared to 78 min. from Michael Tilson Thomas), one Gramophone reviewer put this CD at the top of his list. I grant that it's certainly very good, and the Concertgebouw is all that one could hope for."
5,Great buy.,Great baby pool float for introducing babies to water. My 10 month old loves being in it. Definitely recommend.
3,Nice Float!,This float has worked out great for our little kiddo! He does enjoy the bells in the middle but could care less about the rings. We are thinking of cutting them out because they don't inflate and are pretty much just in the way. The portion of the float where a mom/dad can be is nice but really probably not necessary. I would recommend this item.
5,Love it,I love this product! I used it all summer long at the beach with my daughter in Europe and it is a great product.
3,Framed in Fire,"The book, ""Framed in Fire"" was a great book. Peter, a teenage boy with ADD, is trapped in a mental hospital, but he wants to escape. The book is about his adventures trying to escape from the hospital. While he is at the hospital, he meets people with problems like his, and problems much different than his. I enjoyed this book because it was well written, and the author wove everything together well. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who would like to read it. I would mostly recommend it to kids who actually have ADD. Enjoy reading!"
3,more info needed for sale,"Had the seller given more info such as the measurements of the bail's opening, this item would really sell. Not knowing this key info, makes customers uncertain as to whether or not it will fit on their chains."
4,good chairs for the price,"For the price these chairs were a good buy. They go well with our kitchen table. The assembly was pretty easy except for putting the seats on, but managed to do it. (There were no pre-drilled notches to guide the screws.) They are sturdy and comfortable."
3,issues with chamois seams,"I was very happy with the fit and feel of these bibs. They do seem to run small, I ordered one size larger than I needed and they fit well. However, after less than 10 rides the seam on the chamois has started to come apart. I also bought a pair of Silverline roubaix bib shorts and they are having the same problem, the chamois seam has come apart after just a few rides."
4,"A highly sympathetic, detailed view of the Queen","Sarah Bradford, an accomplished and very thorough biographer, offers a highly sympathetic and detailed account of Queen Elizabeth II's life up to the mid-1990s. The book sparkles early with fascinating accounts of the Queen's formative years, particularly those during the scandal involving the Duke of Windsor and her father's subsequent -- and highly successful -- reign. In her presentation of Queen Elizabeth's reign, Bradford's biography is occasionally bogged down by an excess of names. The Queen's fondness for horses is also presented in extensive detail. Nevertheless, this biography is successful at providing a peek into Queen Elizabeth's life and offering insight into the Queen's dedication to her role as Queen of Britain and the Commonwealth."
3,Competent,"Good biography--but of the celebrity type. Try Ben Pimlott's ""The Queen"" for more of a look at the political role Elizabeth II has played in her long reign."
3,Interesting and worth a read,"This is a very well put together book, well researched and easy to read. I just found much of it very irritating. I think it was possibily because the author was trying extremely hard not to be contraversial or mean about the Queen. I would have liked a more indepth review of the mind of the woman who has led such an amazing life (and ruined her children's lives by refusing to live in the real world). The author is critical of QE2 in that she does put duty before family, but this was not explored deeply enough. I am no major royal supporter, interested in the history more than anything and this book is a great record of QE2's life but I felt that this book was too ""naice"", not gutsy enough and basically portrayed QE2 as a shallow, cold, personality challenged, protocol obsessive woman. While some of the above comments probably suit her, there must be more to her"
2,NO WAY!!!,"I must say this was one of the kindest books to QE2. Well why shouldn't it be? It is written in coroperation with the palace. So if this woman wrote anything negitive that looked damaging to the Queen, well it would be removed. Don't belive everything you read. This book is just palace mumbo-jumbo. The author makes some bucks and the palace has a nice look to it. Good job, but not real.Read Kitty Kelly's The Royals, that was banned in the UK by the Royal family. Why? Something to hide Queeny!!!"
4,A Cookbook Worth Buying,"I asked for and received this book as a birthday gift. It was an excellent choice. At first I thought the recipes somewhat intimidating. A closer examination proved me wrong. The directions are as clear as can be, and suggestions in the side boxes are interesting, helpful and appropriate to the recipe. While I won't be using the recipes calling for fresh truffles or caviar (and they're very few), I will be trying out many others. The Seared Tuna on Creamed Spinach is worth the price of the book. The Black Pepper Polenta was perfect with it, but plain rice or coconut rice is very good, too."
4,"Good Performances, Good Value","Kubelik clearly had a special relationship with these works, as evidenced by the recent reissue of symphonies 7 and 9 with the Vienna Philharmonic from the 1950's in the Decca Legends series, but it is these recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic from the 70's that have become somewhat of a standard by which more recent recordings are judged. All three symphonies are played very well, with judicious choices of tempi and detailed orchestration. The sound is excellent for its time and DG has done a good job with the remastering. And yet, I still go back to the set of these symphonies with the Cleveland Orchestra under Dohnanyi on Decca as my absolute top choice. The sound on the latter rivals any cd I've heard from any source and the readings seem to have a bit more life than Kubelik. The Cleveland versions are also available on a 2 for 1 set from Decca, so either set is a good value. You probably won't be disappointed with either set."
5,Me too!,"Add me to the people raving about this budget-friendly 2-CD set. The quality of the recordings is very high, as one would expect with DG. Plus, the variety of the selections is quite pleasing. We tend to think of Wagner as being martial and thunderously dramatic, but this collection allows the tremendous range of Wagner's work to come out, particularly those slowly building moments of sublime, lush beauty.If I had the Wagner-loving portion of my life to do over again, I would buy this 2-CD set first, listen to it for about three months, and then and only then move on to the other stuff."
4,It's OK,"I judge this CD for it's sound quality - very good. The Wagner's music it's not really my type of music, therefore I can't say it's a poor CD. If the music is just OK is not the CD's fault. Simply my taste doesn't match Wagner's music."
1,Absolute waste of money,"Please do not waste your money on this book! It is such a joke. Unfortunately, the premise of poring through 50,000 names appealed to me. What the book's jacket didn't mention was that the names are all unbelievable and obviously made up. I can't even count how many times she makes up compound names (Joanielee or Stacielee or Phoebelee) to fill in space.Do yourself a favor and find a good baby name Web site instead. It will save you lots of time and you won't feel like a fool for shelling out $19.95 for this piece of garbage!I can't believe this book made it into print. Awful awful awful!!"
1,Poorly researched and hard to read,"I have to agree with the other negative reviews for this book. I bought it last night because the one other first name book I have was put out by Oxford University Press and includes a disproportionate number of Celtic names.I thought this book would help me flesh out my list of possibilities. No such luck. As many others have said, there are so many names here that are made up, extremely rare, or simply bizarre, that it's very hard to spot the good ones in the mix.What's more, in listing so many invented names, the author vioates the very advice she gives earlier in the book. Finally, I found her section of ""fun lists"" to be unsupported and arbitrary, and her etymologies to be incorrect.As others have said. Save yourself some money and buy a smaller book, a better book, or just search online. This book isn't worth it."
1,Don't buy this book!,It's a joke. Most of the names are ridiculous. I don't know anyone who would name their kid Mohawk or Wave. This book was a total waste of money.
5,"By Far, the BEST BABY NAME BOOK!","This is the quintessential best baby name book of them all. The most complete, the most fun, and the most thorough by far. You'll enjoy the 150+ lists of babynaming lists (names for the future Most Popular and Most Beautiful) and names for future doctors, architects, etc."
2,Don't waste your time,This book is not very good and it doesn't have any good baby names in it. It's lame.
2,Not the best,"It does probably have 50,001 names, but so many of them are beyond ridiculous. It does help get started, but reading it is more like finding a needle in a haystack."
2,"well, there are 50,001 names","There are indeed 50,001 name in this book (I'm just taking the word of the author for this, I didn't count). But some of the names are just plain dumb. Pluto? Now is this based on the planet or the cartoon dog? Or how about Grasshopper? Also included are names of several Star Wars characters and multiple derivatives of each. I'm not very impress with this book what so ever.Next time I will look for a book with less hype and more real names. This book gets 2 stars because it does have some real ,and not stupid, (imo) names. Look at some of the other books and you may find a winner, this isn't it."
3,There are a lot of bad names out there!,"There are a lot of bad names in this book. It seems that every food, color, season, etc is a name. If you want a selection of traditional names, don't choose this book."
1,Absolute Rubbish!,"There may be some nice names in this book but they are so diluted by things like ""Canal-word as name"" and lists titled ""Death-Row Names"" and ""Names that make you feel Weird"" that we found it completely useless."
3,Seriously funny,"I viewed this book, and I thought that is was quite amusing. Yes, I realized that most of the reviews on this book thought that the names were made up, but if you look at the names that some of these parents are giving these days, the author to me, were just going by that fact. Some of these names do make a child want to just yell to their parents, ""what were you thinking when you named me."" I found some of list a little off the wall, but if you cannot have a little humor while deciding what to name your baby, then I do not know what to say. The only thing that I was surprised by was that the name Patricia was not mentioned, and I remember that I had to deal with several people named Patricia in the 7th grade.The overall point the author was trying to make is have fun naming your baby, but do not go so overboard with the naming process, until you end up naming your daughter, Anigone Sky or your son, Green Tree. Now that is too far."
5,Refreshing,"I gave this book to my expectant niece as a gift. She was very pleased at the variety of ideas and her husband enjoyed the stories that were included from people relating their personal experiences of their own names. As a gift, it was certainly worth the money, that's for sure!"
5,"""Timeless""","This CD is ""timeless"". It may have been released in 2001 - but it pulls us back in time to that great era of the '50's. Ronnie has re-captured the ""feel"" of that great era. I can only say, that if it were not for the control by ""playlists"" on todays radio programs, this CD would definately make No.1. ""The Million Dollar Quartet"" would definately make it to No.1 on the country charts. I very highly recommend this CD to all music lovers of the 50's and 60's and traditional country music."
5,kicking' Butt !!,"My first impression is WOW.My hair are rising up to the sky when i hear ""When doowop was young"" great just GREAT.The start ""did you hear me calling baby"" gets my out of my chair.I'm a rock a billy,rock and roll lover so this cd hass all of that.I only can say if you like the fifthy's get this cd. Ronnie did a very great job on it,now i sit down listen and waiting on his next cd.Mattie Boonen a music lover from Maastricht.The Netherlands."
5,Maybe best adventure/anthropology book ever?,This book could be the best adventure book I have ever read and best anthropology book ever. I could not put this book down. How could I have gone 36 years without reading it. I read Kon Tiki 20 years ago and loved that as well. This ranks up there with Bryson and Cahill for adventure/history writing.
2,"Not durable, and pieced too small.","My daughter got this for her 5th birthday, and it really looks cute and fun in the box. Within 5 minutes of playing with it, the small clip that holds the starfish open broke. In addition, the mermaids and other pieces that come with this toy are microscopic. If your kids are like mine, they will lose the items and bug you all day to help them find it. This toy is really cute, but not worth it. Save yourself the hassle. Buy the big barbies and pretend there is a big seashell to play in."
5,Spiritually Rewarding,"I have purchased other enlightening books by other authors, but I keep returning to Eva Bell Werber. She quenches my thirst for higher consciousness. I would not be without one of her books. Every page is a lesson in life. Outstanding insight into my soul."
5,frenetic,"I'm giving it five stars because the piano concerto is my favorite of post-war concerti. It is exhausting, but thrilling and ultimately absolutely satisfying. It is controlled chaos, a derailled train that manages to stay on course for hundreds of miles. In an onlslaught of aggressive syncopations, isorhythms, and quick tempi, you can pick apart themes reminiscent of Bartok and eastern european folk music. I'm not sure how the harmonies were conceived - quartal, pitch set, or what - but the result is surprising and exciting.The other concerti are enjoyable, but I listen to the piano concerto much more frequently."
2,A major disappointment,Try and find the Sony recording of the Piano Concerto. Stoggy tempi - overclose recorded sound.
3,The concerto for cello is interesting,The concerto for cello is interesting and holds up well even with repeated listenings. The rest of these pieces I did not enjoy.
4,All about Steve,"This shows evrything from, backround history, and family members. Where he lived, and all that godd stuff. It even shows most of the game score, and all the records of his game from High School till present, it has good details, and is not too long. Easy Books to read, and very interesting."
4,More than I expected,"I had to read this book during my senior year of high school for a Criminal Justice course. I didn't expect much out of it, but John Edwards is a lot more talented that I previously thought. He does talk about his life quite a bit, but not enough to skip through it. I would recommend this book as either leisure reading or for anyone interested in law."
5,Pleasantly Suprised,"I picked this book up during the primaries to have it autographed, unsure if I would ever read it, or even keep it for that matter. Being a conservative, Edwards just doesn't gel with me politically. I decided to broaden my horizons one day and give it a try. To my suprise, I enjoyed it. Edwards is easy to read, and a great storyteller. The stories are interseting, and you want to keep on reading. The book was not a platform for liberal political issues, or for his run for office.The book was a story about the Four Trails that meant the most to John Edwards. I believe the man's heart was really into his work, and he seemed to have a deep care for his clients. Along the way, you also see into the very human side of Edwards, his love for family, and even some of his struggles. If you can put aside your political persuasions, this book is a great pick."
4,This Guy Is Running For President?,"I have to admit that I expected the regular political junk from this book, but this guy really can write. It's not a ""morning in america "" kind of thing -- there's no boring politics. It's just a plain old good roaring read. More like Baldacci or other legal thrillers than ""man from hope"" self-serving junk. I'm not so sure about this guy's politics (I'm a republican myself) but it doesn't matter.If you expect an overview of the Clean Air act or something, you can forget it. The stories in this book really hooked me. I'm still amazed that they are real."
2,From P-I-L to president?,"I don't know - somehow a being a career personal injury lawyer (we call them ambulance chasers up here in Virginia) doesn't seem a decent qualififcation to be president. I thought I would find his book illuminating, and point in some way to what some see as presidential material.He spins a good yarn (with help from his co-author) but in the end, he's just another P I L.I'd just as soon vote for Lowell ""THE HAMMER"" Stanley. Sorry folks."
3,Just a PR attempt to get your vote,"I live in NC, and I've been wondering what John Edwards has been doing lately besides running for president. Nice to know that he writes well, but that's all. He has done nothing while senator for NC than run for president. What a disappointment he has been to this state."
2,Saint Edwards?,"That's how my partner referred to John Edwards, sarcasm apparent in her voice, after reading this book. This is very much a character piece, designed to give a feel for Edwards as a person, rather than Edwards as a candidate. Short on policy, longer on ""I care about justice for the people working to get by.""Unless you're already an Edwards fan and want to learn more about your idol, or have an interest in product liability and medical malpractice civil suits, pass on this one."
1,Rated 1 star because 0 stars weren't available,"I contributed to his campaign in 2004 and received this book included with my contribution. I hate this book!He glorifies how he sued Doctors out of the water.I know many doctors that do as much as they can to help people and lawyers like Edwards are a reason some doctors(who are a little guy on their own) have gone to hell.Let's do some math!Let's say a Surgeon makes $450,000/yearUncle Sam takes about half which is $225,000A doctor who just lost a malpractice suit, such as a surgeon, will look to pay $150 to $200,000 per year on malpractice insurance. ($225,000 minus $200,000 = $25,000)Wow! Many people make more than some surgeons! Thanks to Edwards-like lawyers."
1,Champion for the little guy?,"Senator Edwards' book was certainly an eye opener. He portrays himself as a humble advocate for the overlooked and underpriveledged. Unfortunately, because of his actions and the actions of similar malpractice and personal injury lawyers, jackpot jury awards are driving the up the cost of physician malpractice insurance to shocking levels. It is becoming increasingly difficult for these same overlooked and underpriveledged people to have access to proper medical care as a result of doctors fleeing hostile states. He also fails to eduacate the reader about the fact that he became very wealthy from his contingency fees. I can almost see the ghost of Bill Clinton in the background of his book cover as he ""feels their pain"". Cry me a river."
4,"Nobody is perfect, but why did it have to be the No. 5?","I love the No. 5. And Bohm's other Beethoven recordings are some of my most valued..anythings. But what the heck happened here? This fifth symphony is not good, and the tempo ain't the half of it. Slower tempos are fine. The problem is something else, like affinity for the music or something. As long as I have my Giulini/LA Phil No. 5(definately buy it!), I'll be fine. On a much happier note, the 4 is great! I've heard a few others and this one far surpasses them."
5,"Lush, dramatic and evocative","I played Symphony No. 1 on the way home from work today, and it was as if I were being transported to a higher plane. No music has ever done that to me.I haven't listened to much classical music for a long time, but recently I found myself drawn to Beethoven as I had 20 years ago. Upon the first listening, these symphonies drew me in and carried me away. I love Beethoven's complexity, drama and sublety. This music so clearly demonstrates why people for generations have considered Beethoven one of the greatest composers.In the hands of Karl Bohm and the Vienna Philharmonic, these symphonies express themselves like a flower awakening to the sun.The sound quality of this recording is exceptional. It is like being in the symphony hall, but more personal."
1,Wow.,"I tend to be very forgiving of some bad movies. This ""movie"" is so, so bad, it's not even so-bad-it's-good or anything like that. I can't believe these people were serious. I am shocked that something like this ever saw the light of day. There really should be a zero-star rating option."
5,Awesome !!,this was great i received the cds much sooner than i expected .. the cds r brand new and dont hesitate on buying this
3,A bit dated.,"This author has that verbosity typical to the time it was written. It's helpful but a bit long and of course says nothing of issues more relevant to the present: like the role of technology in studying, the distractions kids face today, or learning disabilities such as ADD.While it wasn't bad, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind when I downloaded it."
4,A Kid's Introduction to Dirt Track Racing,"This book is an excellent junior-high level novel, an interesting saga of three boys who pool their money and go racing one summer in California. The author does a good job of capturing the flavor of short track racing. Fast-paced and exciting, it offers very good character development and an intriguing plot. A kid's classic, especially for young racing fans."
4,Slightly better than the T-Fal series,"The design and function is a bit better than the T-Fal series, but the non stick surface on these will wear away with regular use just like the T-fal series does. Depending on your luck you may get some pans with a better coating than others. In either case, it appears all these types of cooking products last only a few years before needing to be replaced no matter what name is branded on them.While these may have a better design than the T-Fal series, you will pay extra for that better design. As usual, try and get these when they are on sale from time to time."
1,Not Isolated,"This power supply works fine, but the issue I have is that each supply is not isolated, meaning that everything shares a common ground. That means this is really not different than a daisy chain like ONEspot which is a much cheaper option or plugging everything into a power strip. For $100, you're better off getting the BBE supacharger or the T-Rex Fuel tank, which are both isolated power supplies. If you can spend the extra money, go with the voodoo labs power."
2,one major weakness,"The ""brick"" itself works fine. It's as sturdy as any MXR stomp box, and powered my pedals adequately. The ""wall wart"" power adapter, however, is another story entirely-- the cord on mine snapped at the stress relief joint just a few months after purchase, rendering it useless. It didn't survive rehearsal-- no way it's going to stand up to weekly gigs.Dunlop's support rep simply told me to shell out $30 for a replacement. Thanks a lot! I expect much better reliability (and customer service) for a $120 item."
2,Looks good. But thats about it.,"It looks sturdy, but thats where the good stuff ends.- It looks sturdy because of an awesome metal casing. Under that, its all light plastic.- The wall adapter is really bad. Thin wires. Only 2 pins (so I'm not sure about good grounding) I have to treat it with too much care.- My 18V outputs stopped working shortly after I got it.- There aren't any isolated outs- Sometimes it doesn't work okay and I have to unplug and plug, to get it going.Mine is about a year old. Problems have started recently... 3-4 weeks back."
3,Doesn't work with line 6 modelers,"At the first time with the product out of the box i realized that it was smaller than i thought, good for me more space in my pedalboard, when i turned it on i became blind by that crazy bright blue LED,not a problem, But when i tried to plug in my LINE6 DL4 i thought: i did spend all my money for nothing!!! It doesn't work with LINE6 modelers..."
2,"Save it for a boring, rainy day.","Though I am a big fan on Baby-sitters Club, I really think this book was not worth my money or time. The plot is really stupid.It starts out that Mary Anne's step-grandparents' house flooded. While she is helping to clean up, she finds a music box. It has a threat note on it. Mary Anne asks her step grandmother about it, but Granny denies everything. But you can tell right away she's a main suspect just by the way the book is describing her voice. In the end, the BSC finds out who's it really was (which is pretty obvious) Don't waste your money on this book because it's not worth it. But if you are bored enough, borrow it from a friend or library."
2,Pass this one up.,"I started watching Dallas on DVD with fond memories of watching it with my grandma. So, in search of All Things Dallas, I bought this book. It's not a 'complete story' of the show, actors, etc. (like I somehow thought it would be), it's a recap of every episode. Just watch the darn show instead."
4,Forkies will enjoy,"The person I bought this for is not an avid reader, but is a longtime fan of Dallas (who taught me that the fans are called Forkies). The recipient read the book cover to cover and kept sharing tidbits along the way.I do not intend to read this, but based on the commentary I received, the book is a must-have for Dallas fans."
5,New Rules,"This was probably one of the best books I've ever read. The way the writer had the character going through all the problems that we as teenagers have to deal with every day is really awesome. As Max transitions from the uptight person he is in the beginning of the book to the laid back sort of party guy he is near the end, it all makes perfect sense and its not like in your face about it."
3,Ive read better,"This book was an okay book. It was a light reading book. Great storyline, characters, etc., but I have read better. It is a nice YA book; however, there wasnt anything in there for me to take with me in life, or there wasnt anything so catchy that I will never forget."
5,recommended by me and Gramophone,this is an excellent recording in every respects... a thoroughly russian interpretation from a superb orchestra
5,"A 90's Winesburg, Ohio: sane, savvy and sad","Jim Henry's narrative voice is eminently sane while he describes conflicts of maddening dimension. Each story resounds in its own right. An exercise in writer's craftsmanship disguised as a great read, albeit for thinkers not unwilling to pause and reflect on what is going on here in the late, late 20th century."
5,Best Ultimate X-men so far,"I own all of the hardcover Ultimate X-men volumes, and this one is my favorite. The storylines it contains are interesting and well written, and the illustrations are well done. The introduction of the character Angel, in particular, was handled beautifully. Highly recommended to anyone reading the ultimate versions of the classic Marvel comics."
1,Doesn't do what it's supposed to...,"... so, the product description and the packaging itself clearly says:""SAFE TO USE ON ANY DISC SURFACE!""It even shows five different types of CDs... a ""DVD,"" ""CD-R,"" ""compact disc,"" ""CD-ROM,"" and ""PlayStation.""Yet on the back, above the UPC, there's a sticker which says, ""Not For Printable Discs, Porous Surfaces, Paper or Cloth Products.""Um... hello? Doesn't that defeat the point of this product?I specifically bought this so I could remove marker that I've used to write on ""printable disc"" surfaces, of DVDs I made from old VHS tapes.Worse yet, the product says it cannot be returned to Amazon, though by calling them up, you can manage to successfully do it as I just did. (assuming you don't open the product)So... if you bought this to remove ink from white printable surface discs you've labeled like I did... think again. At least, according to the sticker above the UPC.This product is also made in Taiwan."
2,Not So Good,"My experiences reading Tanith Lee have been rather hit-or-miss, and I'm afraid I would have to classify THE CLAIDI JOURNALS as a miss. It is very hard to care about what happens to the diffident Claidi on her journey through the strange world of hers. I wouldn't mind a moody teenager as a narrator if she was a more descriptive moody teenager, who let us into her mind and heart."
4,Never read Tanith Lee?,"Increasingly I find myself browsing in the ""Young Adult"" section of the bookstore, and most of the time, I don't regret it. Here is where I found the Claidi Journals, and their sequel, Wolf Wing.I fell in love with the wonderful lyrical quality of Lee's prose, and with Claidi and her story. I bought the Journals on Friday and once finished on Saturday, immediately ran out and bought Wolf Wing. I want the story to continue! How often can one say that after reading 800 or so pages?I was reminded reading the Claidi Journals of Garth Nix's ""Abhorsen"" series, which I also adored. Anyone who was a fan of Sabriel, Lirael or The Abhorsen will also love this series."
5,Claidi Journals,"These books are a wonderful collection of stories. They are written in the style of a diary. The stories are about 'Claidis' adventures through an unknown world. Power, love and magic all play major roles in this story. Definitly worth a read if you like fiction. Try it!"
4,good,"While the Claidi journals have princes, princesses, young attractive bandits and a spunky herione, they're not as cliched as they could be. The dialogue is funny and Claidi is obviously an intelligent human being, not a clod. She's a character you can enjoy and not the kind you always wind up getting annoyed by. There's plenty of surprises and twists in the plot that are mostly unforseeable, which makes it very interesting and you won't get lost along the way. The only rule: Never try to explain the plot to anyone who hasn't already read the books. It is virtually impossible. All in all, a very good book. Fun characters, good settings, and a fast pace so you won't get bored. Definitlely not light reading (740 pages! Wow!)."
1,stings my eyes,"Let me be clear - I LOVE PTR products - but this one made my eyes sting, and i could not apply eye make up on top of it. For now, I am sticking with PTR unwrinkle eye."
2,Not effective,"I love PTR's anti-aging face cleaner and ultra-lite anti-aging face moisturizer, so I also expected to like this eye gel as well. However, I don't think that it comes close to working as well as other similarly priced eye moisturizers I have tried. I don't recommend it."
5,Finally!,"Finally! I have waited sixty years for someone to FINALLY bring John Carter to the big screen. Technology wasn't available when I was young, so it was the library and your own imagination, or nothing. I loved all the John Carter books, and reread them many times. Burroughs fed the imaginations of generations. Sadly, he is missing from most library shelves, replaced by Harry Potter and the Twilight gang.Thank you to Disney studios for doing a great job on an outstanding adventure. Sincerely hope The Gods of Mars and the Warlord of Mars are followups. Great story, great effects, and a great John Carter!"
5,"love the movie, and the quility","great movie, great fx, great story, tharks where very well done, Dejah is super hot, you will love totally it"
5,worth it,"Great movie! had read the book years ago. wildly entertaining story which Disney delivered perfectly! Well worth watching! Exciting adventure, very imaginitive!"
5,"Box office bomb, but Home Theater hit","Hearing how much Pixar spent making the move intrigued me into watching. Aside from the unintelligible blabbering, the movie was great. I am now a fan of Lynn Collins!"
4,"No surprises in the plot, but still fun to watch","I don't know why this film got panned so much by critics. I read some of the John Carter stories as a child, so I wanted to see the movie, but the poor reviews in the papers and online nearly made me change my mind. I don't regret seeing it in the end. The plot doesn't have any surprises, but the scenery of Mars and the skyships were impressive, and Princess Deja Thoris is quite a beauty!"
4,It bombed on the big screen but still a good movie!,"This movie really bombed a the theaters and really broken down by the critics but to me this movie was really good. The story, special effects, the sound and the acting was all very good. I really enjoyed this movie also because it has enough action to keep my attention. If a movie is boring to me I will not pay attention to it. This blu-ray has very good picture and sound I give this movie a B+"
4,Good fun,Engaging enough to leave you wanting to know more about the characters. Good action and effects. Suitable for kids and adults.
3,Decent sci fi,Lots of good effects and action. But like most of the other attempts of this book it falls Well short.
4,Blame the Studio!,"John Carter is not without flaws. Some of the plot points just don't make sense, and the editing is mediocre. With that being said, there's quite a lot that the film has going for it. Many people are turned off by Kitsch, but I find him to be a likable enough actor that does well with the material he's given. The visual are astounding, and the motion capture effects are really great. The true problem with the movie lies with the marketing campaign, which failed to give a hint as to what the movie was actually about. It's a shame that it performed so poorly at the box office, because I would definitely like to see a continuation of the story."
4,Good Entertainment/Fun Adventure,"There is nothing particularly outstanding about this movie, but I enjoyed it the whole time I was watching it and it was fun. The overall feel is very positive and adventurous. Good job."
3,Let's hope they get a second chance...,"Beautiful cinematography; outstanding special effects; ultimately, sorta flat. It was OK, but after 100 years (their words, not mine), I'd've hoped for something a bit more focussed: I don't know if familiarity with the original material was a help or a hindrance...the story touched on SO many aspects of ERB's Barsoom, but only vaguely developed any of them. It was fun, but in the end, dissatisfying."
4,I liked it,"I think the worst part of the movie was the ad campaign. Every time we saw the commercial on TV we thought we would not want to sit through a couple hours of bad CGI, but we decided to go anyway. (I bet a lot of people decided not to) It was a lot better than we hoped and although there is a lot of CGI the effects were worked in to the story so they were much different than we imagined. They did over do the jumping bits but what they heck. To those who say it is a financial flop...When they stopped giving box office reports it was at $269 million and the DVD has not come out yet.I plan to buy the DVD when it is available."
1,So hard to watch!,"Ugh. NO SEQUELS! Disney, just let this die. This was slow moving, poorly acted and a total waste of time!"
1,Sigh... Who didn't this movie steal from,"The dog from UpShakespeareGeorge Lucas (effects,creatures,vehicles, soundtrack, even the speeder chase scene)BraveheartWild Wild WestOh hell, I'm too tired from watching this thing to list it allBoring, formulaic and dumb. Too long. Unlikeable characters."
1,John Carter disappointing,"I wasn't expecting ""space"" stuff. I was disappointed. Had to watch the whole movie to get to the ""good part"", which, wasn't what I would call ""good"". jmo."
1,Giving This One Star is Being Too Generous!,"Hey! You over there! You wanna throw your wallet down a sewer but you don't have a sewer but a credit card instead, buy John Carter on Blu-ray and give into this box office and critic flop."
1,The movie that should have never been made into a movie,"Before everyone has a heartattack, I do know that this book? comic? whatever. Was written before Star Wars and Lucus might have stold some of the ideas. That is why this should have never been made into a movie. Everything has been stolen by someone eles. It make the movie look very unorginal. I'm one of the few that saw this at the movie. It was the movie that would never end. There were so many false endings, that I stopped caring about the characters and just sat there thinking about what I was going to do after the movie. The characters were so bad. The guy from ""fridays night lights"" and Megan Fox's older ugly sister had zero chemistry. He had more chemistry with the alien girl then her. I like cliffhangers, but when I saw that ending...I wanted to punch the wall. It was one of the worst endings I have seen in awhile. I did learn that even on Mars...guys still fall for the girls with implants."
5,SEE THIS MOVIE!!!,"John Carter [of Mars] is what a classic SciFi movie should be...it was hugely entertaining with interesting characters that you can actually root for, and nowhere near as predictable as other SciFi flicks with similar plot lines (coughAvatarcough)Franky heads need to roll at Disney for the way they mis-promoted and mis-marketed this this great movie...it could have been, and should have been, a continuing franchise for the Mouse...but once again they have showed they are clueless on how to market a film that isn't about princesses (even if the book John Carter was based had ""princess"" in the title)..."
5,Dont rent this film... BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been waiting for this film for over 30 years and It was well worth the wait! Having viewed the film over 8 times in the theater, have to say that it doesnt get old. Everytime I see something that I missed the first viewing. Those of you who have large screen TVs will enjoy the full edge to edge action filling the screen in every shot.The two best things I can relate from taking friends and family to see the film was one My 75yr old mother's comment that ""John Carter was the best film I had seen since the first Star Wars in 77"" (she is now reading all of the John Carter books) and my best friend Shanon who said she hates Sci-Fi movies and loved the movie so much that she named her next rescue dog Dejah!Dont let bad press keep you from owning the best film of the year! Take your Face out of a Book and Take Me Back To Barsoom!"
3,"Great movie, but digital copy is a ripoff!","I can't believe this was not a HUGE box office hit! A great movie from start to finish and a lot of fun. Can't wait for the DVD to be released so I can watch it again....I just downgraded my review to 3 stars because of the way Disney is ripping off its customers on the digital copy. I liked this movie so much, I payed extra to get the version with a digital copy. Shortly after installing it, I upgraded to a new laptop and tried to re-install the movie. There is no way to do it! Each movie comes with a code that can only be used ONE time, so you can only install the movie on ONE device. (I also discovered this is true of other ""digital copy"" movies I bought.)So if you are planning to pay extra to get a digital version thrown in, DON'T DO IT (unless you never plan to get a new computer!) I'm sure the ""movie pirates"" will find easy ways around this scheme. This only hurts your honest customers. Shame on you, Disney!"
4,Excellent film with TERRIBLE marketing!,"John Carter was a great film which, unfortunately, suffered from the WORST marketing campaign I've ever seen. Everything from the boring, non-descriptive title to the confusing trailers basically told potential audiences that this film was a waste of time and money to go see... when the exact opposite is true. It's a fantastic and exciting film to watch, with great SFX, good acting and an exciting ending!My only complaint is that the landscape of Mars looks just like the Southwest desert of the United States. The filmmakers could at LEAST have done something to make the Mars landscape look more alien and exotic, rather than just an obvious set location used a thousand times over by various TV and film productions over the past 70 years.That aside, however, I'd give John Carter (of Mars) a 8.5 out of 10! Ignore the naysayers and watch the film for yourself! :)"
4,This is a better movie than the revues.,"I'll admit to being a RGB fan and I've looked forward to some studio tackling the Mars stories. I thought it was a nice update of Burroughs characters which didn't lose the essential nature of those characters. A fun adventure. It's what Mars really should be. As a teen first reading Burroughs the women were alright. As an adult, of course they are not. I was happy to see that the ""incomparable"" Dejah Thoris is an interesting and intelligent scientist/warrior/princess in the film. Even more incomparable than the original. Great sense of fun in the film!"
4,Good Movie!!,"Good Movie but not great. I have read the original books and this movie is close but they changed some plot lines. I do miss that in the books nobody on Mars wore clothes (LOL). The image and sound quality are what you expect from Disney, which is outstanding. I like the 3D image on this movie."
4,Great,I originally rented this movie due to the fact that it didn't do so well at the box office. I have to say that after watching it once I wanted to have it in my collection.
4,Better than I thought it would be. I want more!,"I was really turned off by the marketing of this movie. I knew nothing about the Burroughs stories. I just had no desire to see a Tarzan-esque guy running around fighting martians. I didn't know he was from late 19th century Earth. For whatever reason that made the whole thing better. Was this a phenomenal movie? No. It was a better movie than any of the Transformers movies. I sincerely hope that DVD sales are strong with this and Disney decides to make a sequel. I rarely want to see the next chapter in movies any more. Case in point, The Avengers. I liked it but I didn't care about any of the characters. I don't need to see another Avengers movie. I will, but I don't need to. I ended up liking John Carter as a character. I didn't even hate that CGI dog thing! I want a little more."
5,AWESOME show..,".I do not know why this film did not do better, but my family and I quite enjoy this film a lot."
4,Its way better than the reviews,"This movie was way over hyped when it came out,Too much money was spent for WOW factor.But its not as bad as as the reviews said it was. It reminds me of the origional Star Wars in many way.If you find it in the discount bin its worth checking out."
1,Not worth time or money,"In my opinion this movie made no sense, the plot was messed up, people randomly appeared and was never seen again that at first seemed as though they were going to be important. Basically it made no since. In the trailer they show this crazy bloody fight with two beasts and a man when in the movie, its probably a 10 second clip and means nothing. After seeing the movie the group i went with turned, starred at each other in disgust and couldn't believe we had wasted our money on this."
1,Terrible,"An example of why Disney needs Pixar. The movie was boring, and seemed to drag on forever. The plot was odd yet predictable. I disliked this movie from start to finish."
5,Great film,"This was a terrific film. Don't let ""critics"" or negative reviewers stop you from seeing it. I highly recommend it for a real nice evening of enjoyment.Ask yourself why so many are giving it 5 stars if it was (supposedly) soooooooo bad????"
1,As bad as everyone says.,This movie is poor. Thats all there is to it. Maybe kids who just like cool stuff to look at will be entertained but the story is non-sensical and you will not care about the characters.
1,Simply dreadful.,Not even the wonderful artwork in the landscape and digitally created characters could rescue the poor writing and even worse editing of this movie. Simply dreadful.
1,Ruined by not taking enough time,"For me, this was a big mistake by Disney. Something like this based on ERB's ""Princess..."" should have been done along the same lines as Lord of The Rings. So many really good storylines contained in Princess were just not done to get the thing into a 2-hour slot. A real pity."
3,It's ok...,"Not worth 5 or even 4 stars, but not the colossal failure the reviews made it out to be. It helped pass the time on a wet and boring July 4th."
1,Didn't like this adaption,I read the first three books in the Barsoom series and John Carter missed the mark. Now it will be years before another adaption will be attempted.
5,A Great SciFi Adventure,"This movie was fantastic. Action in a whole new, rich world. Fun for the whole family. A great tribute to Edgar Rice Burroughs and his series."
4,Sci-Fi Fantasy Extravaganza,Disney's John Carter suffered from too much press. It never had a chance to succeed because it was either panned or made out to be more than it was - a good fantasy film. Some of the acting is a bit stiff but the FX is wonderful. Give it a chance and you will have fun.
5,Excellent SCI-FI Movie,"I enjoyed this movie and was amazed at how good it was considering the poor reviews when it was released. I doubt a follow up movie will be made, but Disney did a wonderful job of creating the world of Mars in a somewhat believable fashion."
3,"Movie great, streaming not so great",Really enjoyed the movie but the show would get stuck and would not respond so had to go watch something else and come back to it later. Happened about 6 times. I watched it the next day with no problems.
3,"Great movie, where's the sequel?","John Carter is a great synopsis of the book. I think the acting could have been a little better; there were moments in the movie when the lines and presentation were great, in others just filling air, hence my 3 star rating. I'd like to see a sequel which this alludes to."
3,ok,"It was just ok, I expected a whole lot more even though it did not do so well here in the states. I gave it a try because it had a mix of history/science fiction and action. I think I should have waited untill it came out on cable...."
3,Good movie and the 3d was alright,I thought this movie was pretty good but the 3d wasnt that good compared to like Journey 1 & 2
2,Dumb Movie,It is hard to find something I liked about this movie and I won't be mean and state all the things I didn't like.
4,Futuristic Sci-Fi Type,"John Carter is a Civil War Army Captain who somehow leaps into Red Planet Mars, at a time when Mars/Barsoom is dying. Predators are all around and war is being fought. There are creatures that we would call ""aliens"" and there are folks who look like John. The governing Goddess even sends some transparent beings to give powers to the bad guy and there is a Princess who may be forced to marry the bad guy. There are wild looking space ships and lots of fighting. Enjoyable, action, futuristic."
5,Good Movie,I read the book John Carter of Mars when I was a teen ager in the 70's. I always hoped they would make a movie some day. The visual effects were great. The story was fantastic. I hope they make a sequel. There were several books in the series.
4,"See It, You Won't Regret It","I saw this in the theater and told my 14 year she must go see it. We ran out of time and so I have ben waiting anxiously for the DVD release. I read the book very long ago and loved the story. Seeing it come to life was memorable. I am puzzled over why it was panned, certainly Disney could have done better marketing it. One of my best sci fi movies I have ever seen. See it, you won't regret it!"
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!!,This is such a great movie how can I do it justice with this review? You just have to see it. No spoiler alerts either. Just get this movie. I've watched it several times and I still haven't seen and understood everything in it. Worth watching over and over.
4,good but the books are better,seeing the book brought to life even with the changes is cool. as much bad publicity as it got for not making disney their money back its a good pic
5,An Epic Like Ben Hur or Cleopatra,"Classic films such as Ben Hur and Cleopatra are great Hollywood masterpieces that had grandeur sets filled with countless extras, which today are too impractical and expensive to recreate. This movie brings some of that magic back using modern digital techniques and with a sci-fi spin.This is an epic film in the literal sense... (not as in oh dude, that was so epic!, but more as in Homer's The Odyssey). It is very classic Hollywood stuff, and very entertaining. I enjoyed watching it in the movie theater.I was surprised it did not do so well. Perhaps it just didn't fit in with all the other films that came out around that time, which is just as well, because it has a timeless quality. Perhaps in another 10 years it will become a Hollywood classic. It happens to some films that are viewed myopically, such as The Shining, where the true value of the film is not understood until 10 or 20 years later."
5,Good Movie,This movie was no the terrible movie that critics portrayed in their reviews. It was entertaining and my kids loved it. The kids were bummed when the movie ended and I told them there would not be a sequel!
4,A fantastic Scifi adventure,"One of the best new scif films out in a long while. A Confederate Civil War soldier, finds himself transported to Mars, a desert planet. He ends up in the middle of another war, defeats the bad guys (at least for a while), and finds love in a princess. The special effects are great as was the plot and dialogue. You can;t go worn with this film."
3,Forgetable movie,"The movie was barely palatable. The storyline was poor, the acting was so-so, and the action was forgetable. For a big-budget movie, this ranks as a flop on just about any metric I can think of."
3,Not 2 bad for a disney sci-fi pirates of the caribbean film.,"This film is really just a rip off of Pirates of the Caribbean except it is set on mars. Some of the characters are memorable especially my favorite the moon doggie that follows John Carter around in most of the film. For kids this one will be great for their audience. If you watch this film though it is only really visually exceptional in 3-D, so if you can watch it in that format."
1,pewww,"not a good try at all a lot of hard work doen the drain missed the mark by a mile, wulda shuda cuda"
2,Opinion of Non- Professional,"After first 45 minutes my husband and I just turned it off. If you are not interested in space aliens, you will not want to purchase this movie."
5,It's a fun movie!,"It was a fun movie and worth the money. I saw this in the theater multiple times and while not completely faithful to the books, I really enjoyed it. I took my kids the 2nd time and they thought it was ""epic"". I cannot wait to get this on blu ray."
4,I agree with the ERB fans,"I stand agog after watching this movie. The ""professional"" reviews would have you believe this movie was trash. It stand fast with (1) ERB's books (2) a coherent story and (3) the visual translation of ERB's books. I loved it. The marketing campaign was horrid and conveyed none of the tradition and perspective of the swashbuckling original. It modernized ERB's story (stories, actually, as it composited two books) for a modern audience and laid plausible groundwork for the ethos. Really, I'm more shocked at the reviews than at the minor flaws of the movie.Great, great, great. 4 out of 5. Honest."
2,John( Missed the Mark) Carter,"Let me start off by saying I LOVE MOVIES.Even some of the worst films turn out to be the best for me.Unfortunately, in this case, the same doesn' hold true. I wanted to see if this was a worth buying in 3-D so I viewed it in the 2-D format. The opening of the movie was wonderful. During the air battle ,I remember thinking ""Wow ,it looks like I am in for a great time"". Then as the movie progressed , it just seemed to be lacking something( for me). There was a time when it started to pick up and I said ""ok here we go"" and then about 10 minutes later ,things went sour. Was it terrible? no, was it fun in some parts?yes but just not enough . It just wasn't what I was hopeing for and I really wanted to like it so I could buy it in 3-DOne thing I must say ,it had a happy ending, I was happy it ended"
3,this is wild ...,some parts actual science but the other 90% out there soo far .... if you like FANTASY with a smidge of science it is a cute love story for certain .... the Queen is truly a stunner and action babe too .
3,its ok,I did not see the hole movie to due to a family event that occurred so I really can not say much about this movie.
2,Bad for a reason.,The film was bad. I felt like the makers of Flesh Gordon where given 200million and let loose. It seemed like the graphics where cartoonish with jerky movements to make the bad drawing worse.Normally I like alot of sci-fi (see fifth element).But not this dog.
1,Very Weak,"Only rented it because of all the positive reviews on Amazon but, while watching this movie I realized the Positive reviews had to be fake. The Special effects were top notch but, that was about it. The plot was confusing and the movie never reached any real level of satisfaction. Very disappointing after reading so many positive Amazon reviews..."
1,Boring not at all what I was hoping for.,I fell asleep in the first 45 minutes if you need something to help you sleep and don't want to use a sleeping pill this is for you.
1,Rent before buying,Rent it before buying it. This movie is over rated. It has a so-so story; it is like we saw the story in other movie before.. My wife and I did not enjoy it and felt we wasted time. We will try to sell the movie for 50% of the price.
4,John Carter [HD],Thought this was pretty good considering all the bad reviews. I have seen much worse with better reviews. This is why I don't rely on the reviews that much. Enjoyed this movie.
5,"A Great Surprise, too bad people missed it at the cinema","JOHN CARTER, by the great Andrew Stanton, is really a great movie, with amazing sci-fi action, a wonderful story with unique twists between the real world and the space world, and finally with a cast that plays their roles well and looks good to boot.TOO BAD that the movie suffered so much at the cinemas, people just did not know what to expect with it. I did not either, and I am a Disney enthusiast. But I was so surprised at how much I liked this movie. HOPEFULLY, people will learn about this great flick thru what should be a great BLU_RAY. If you passed on the cinema version, do not pass on the home video release. It is that good."
5,"Good movie, good acting, good special effects. And the critics hated it","John Carter was a fun corny action movie based off of Edgar Rice Burrow'sBook Princess of Mars. It was a masterpiece that was not recognized as a masterpiece. The acting was very good, which made up for the cornyness of the film. The special effects were very good as well, along with the score. Director Andrew Stanton, did fairly good at portraying the John Carter we all love, those of us who have read the book. Taylor Kitsh did an amazing job acting the part. When I walked into the theater I was expecting good but not great. I was wrong"
5,where it all started,"I basically love the concept and the idea's that were attempted in this movie. It's a crying shame the trilogy will be killed by critics and folks who had no idea what the movie was about and didn't see it. Disney dropped the big one here and ruined by their marketing the John Carter of Mar's we all loved from those well read books. I read one critic that said it was a rip off of Star Wars and other space opera's. I assume the man had no concept that Carter is almost a 100 years old and was way before Star Wars ?? It's a fun movie and looked great !!! I admit the screenplay could have been tighter but they did try to stay honest to the history of this wonderful story. I have to wonder why they changed the name to John Carter , it should have been John Carter of Mar's or Barsoom if they were scared of Mars :) Watch the movie and damn the critic's, it's a heck of a lot of fun. Isn't that why we go to the movies after all ????"
4,Critics don't know anything,"This movie came in as one of 2012's biggest flops ?That's because to many people listen to critics .What you have here is a GREAT FLICK , Great story ( not the same 'ol ,same 'ol ) great characters ..A Well done Movie ,very enertaining.I bought it and have watched it 5 times over the coarse of a month ... and I will surely watch it again ......."
5,awesome,this movie is plat out awesome. Every second has you on the edge of your seat and there are so many characters that have so much action its just amazing from beginning to end.
4,I loved it!,"Now I never read the books, but the movie was really good. Granted it was more action than SciFi, but there was enough to make me want to read the series. I would like to see the reactions of those who read the books, and then watched the movie."
5,star waes meets indiana jones,i like d the grafics. the storie was good all around good sci fi movie. the ending was not as expected.
2,Lots of effort for so-so results.,"A lot of effort went into the production of this movie, but it was jumbled and bland. It wasn't terrible enough to be funny, but it wasn't good enough to be very entertaining for me either. Although I didn't love it, it could appeal to other people, and it didn't deserve to bomb at the box office like it did.Pros: There wasn't too much language or graphic situations, and it inspired me to check out the books it was based on.Cons: The plot was confusing, and the movie was long.9/24/12 EDIT: I'm currently reading the book series, and I would have liked John Carter a lot more if I had read it first."
4,Epic Proportions!,A former military captain John Carter is inexplicably transported to Mars where he becomes embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions. In an action packed thriller. This movie will keep you guessing at the edge of your seat.
5,I loved theJohn Carter movie,I loved the movie John Carter and would love Disney to make a sequel to the movie.The reason why John Carter didnt do better was because of the poor name of the movie and the marketing for the movie really was horrible.Anybody that wants to try to get a sequel to John Carter made their is a facebook group called BacktoBarsoom thats trying to make it happen by gathering support for a John Carter sequel to be made.
4,John Carter,It was a good story with excellent special effects.xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
5,Enjoyed this,"One of the great movies, I had a lot of fun watching this.The DVD is well made and has some great extras that allow you to get a feel for what went on behind the scenes.I'm hoping for a series of John Carter's, you can see they used this movie to set up a lot of plots for the future. It would be a shame not to see this play out.Enjoy!!"
5,I LOVE JOHN CARTER,"I wanted to watch it again the moment it ended on the big screen. Fantastic!!! About this Blu-ray / DVD I only miss the trailer featuring ""My body is a cage"" theme by Peter Gabriel."
5,Great Movie.,I personally loved this movie. I don't know why it didn't get better ratings. I like sci-fi movies and this one delivered.
4,Enjoyable Movie,I like to escape quite often and movies like this help fill the bill. I have now rented this movie twice. I really enjoyed the computer generated scenes. A good escape for me.
3,"Good base story, a little cheezy","There is a lot to like in this movie. THe graphics are nice, the underlying story has depth and is entertaining. However, I find many scenes, dialogs, and characters are a little cheezy in an unnecessary way. A little gratuitous naked flesh here, a little too polished bad guy there. It is a little disappointing."
4,John Carter,I thought it was strange and entertaining for a small mind like mine. But hey that is what movies are all about-they entertain!
2,JOHN CARTER,"JOHN CARTER,TWO STARS ONLY FOR EFFECTIVE, NOTICABLE EFFORT. THE PLOT WAS/IS NOT BELIEVABLE. VISUALLY ""COMMON"" FOR THE ADVERTISING RELEASES."
3,Underrated,This is a fun movie. I really don't understand why it got such bad reviews when it was released. It was a little slow at the beginning but once it got going it was great.
4,Don't see why this flopped at the box office,"This Disney film is much better than most of the super-hero movies that now clog the movie screens of today. The plot is thin, but the special effects are good. I got a little lost in the explications of how a 19th-century explorer ends up on Mars, and the ending left me a little confused, too. No matter. Most of the movie is quite fun to look at. The love story at the core is very PG-rated, per Disney. This cost millions to make, and I guess it didn't make it back at the box office. Too bad because there is quality here."
3,Better than a B grade movie,I enjoyed watching this and will probably do so again. If you like early scifi with modern special effects then it is the show for you.
3,Great Movie,But..... If it's creators actually got what's in this movie off the book they must be on crack. John Carter in the book was nothing like the character they invented for the movie.
3,John Carter,Movie seemed to rush into different scenes...good action...but never felt the connection with the main character. It's shallowly but entertaining at the same time.
4,Great. Reviews way too harsh,"Just borrowed the flick from my father-in-law. I told him it got wretched reviews, so I hadn't put much thought into watching it. Honestly, after I finished it all I could think was : Why did this bomb again? I would recommend someone to watch this and I would also watch a sequel. The acting was fine, plot was good, characters funny at times, and CGI well done. I haven't read the books yet, but they're free to read on project gutenberg. This is a story that is over 100 years old. That in itself is impressive. Very creative thinking for that long ago. Anyways, what do I know! To each his own."
1,Bleh and bitter that the only option was to purchase it,"All I can say is we thought our 6 year old son (who is completely obsessed with making up Martian battles) would enjoy this movie. We were reluctant to buy it but, since that was the only option, we did. The 6 year old thought it was boring. So did we. Don't waste your money."
1,Terrible!,"This is a TERRIBLE movie! I couldn't even finish it. There is no plot, the characters are stupid and weakly developed, and it is difficult to follow. Don't waste your time or money!"
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,John Carter was a terrible and boring movie. My kids and I both thought that the actors were terrible and overly dramatic. I would have given it no stars if that were an option. You are being ripped off for the price. Terrible.
1,John Carter Review - Pixellation Frustration,"The Movie story is different and enjoyable, but the quality of the movie was horrendous, and many of the special effects became a blur of pixels. I use Vudu now and get HDX movies with no problem"
1,The plot sucks acting sucks !,"Ok.. I am a minority here. But I can't figure out the taste of those people giving 5stars to this movie.. I think it is something like Democrat vs Republic stuff.. I remember many people had given 1star to ""No Country for Old Men"" which is worth all 5stars... So anyways, I rented this movie from Amazon VOD based upon higher user ratings.. and Now I agree with the critics.. The plot sucks.. the lead actress totally puts dumb face many times..And there are is nothing original or interesting in this movie to watch.. I just wasted my time and money..And this can no way be compared to Star Wars or Avatar."
5,I loved it!!,"I absolutely LOVED this movie. I couldn't believe it didn't get good reviews. It was wonderful. The visuals were stunning and I loved the Tharks! I don't know how many times I have watched it and enjoy it every time. I was put off by the name at first, but I'm glad I went past it. When I read about it, I couldn't believe the Civil War soldier transported to Mars!?! As the movie moved along I thought, it made sense to me. I'm 70 years old and I love science fiction, I've seen enough of the real deal. I just wish they would make a sequel."
5,Great Action Adventury,"Personally I liked this movie, it was packed with action and the special effects were spectacular. The creatures were wonderful. I understand this movie was supposed to be #1 of a trilogy, but Disney does not endorse the future episodes. Unfortunately, I think they are missing the mark."
1,Apology is in order,"I've read a lot of reviews where people say ""I really wanted to like this movie"". Well, after hearing from everyone I know who watched it, I would not say I expected to like it, more like, I wanted to see if it had any redeeming qualities. It did not. Took me 4 nights to get thru half this dog. I simply could not take it anymore and gave up. The script, the acting, the director had to be deaf and blind, the editing. I'll stop here and say: ""If you think you're tough, see if you can sit thru this whole movie. I give it one star because you can't do minus a star. The apology should go to Mr. Burroughs."
2,Not so kid friendly,I was excited to watch this movie. However if u watch this better have a clearplay they have bad language and take God's name in vain something I really didn't expect from a Disney movie and I am a huge Disney fan. I was very disappointed.
1,Awful,"A terribly boring affair from start to... well, we did not finish the movie. Yes, it was that bad. How could you ruin a wonderful comic? John Carter answers that question."
2,i am a very big nerd and even I say that this movie suck,First of all i am am very big nerd so i generally LOVE this kid of movie.THE ONLY reason this is not a 1 star is the FXAVOID AT ALL COSTS
1,Don't waste your time,"Seriously... this is the worst movie I have ever seen. It made NO sense, the acting was terrible, and the CGI was awful. I would give it fewer stars if I could. Basically it's like Uwe Boll tried to direct a mashup of A Bug's Life, Dune, Star Wars, Land of the Lost, and Stargate."
3,So glad I didnt Buy this,"In general, Amazon reviews have always been right on for me, And after seeing all the Furor over the movie and how cheap it is to pick up the DVD I almost reached in and snagged one,,,Glad I didnt, I read the John Carter book series back in high school and rememberd alittle of the story line Characters mostly, It does have good CGI but I saw better in StarWars epic battle scenes, Guess I just didnt get into it, My reccomendation is you go to Amazon Instant Video and watch it first $3.99( Like I did) Then you also might not feel a need to watch it again"
1,POORLY DONE MOVIE,"I have read the Martian Series many times. I was ten or so when I read the series for the first time. I have enjoyed the books since first reading them. Just had the displeasure of seeing this movie for the first and last time. Long story short, this movie is very poorly done. The writing, acting, story are silly. What a waste of great base material."
2,"Sadly, no enough of Lynn Collins","I had to take two breaks because I was so tired of the slow moving action. It's difficult to disagree with over 300 viewers, but what can I say?The fx were good.The action was slow.The acting was awful.The script worse than the acting.Lynn Collins was the best of the movie, but they didn't show enough of her and she was too covered up for the role."
2,"Goofy, childish fantasy film","I'm shocked that this movie got an average of 4.5 stars and that there are so many people who take it seriously. It's just a dumb, childish fantasy movie. It's not worthy of being called science fiction. I normally like popcorn movies but this one was too dumb, goofy, and childish. It was made for 9 year olds. It's like a combination of Star Wars and Avatar. I'm surprised this movie didn't receive a lot more hate since the green aliens are reminiscent of Jar Jar Binx, who was despised by so many. There is plenty of corny, cheesy, bad acting. I disliked that the princess is a great scientist and also a great warrior. In the real world, women are neither of those things. I'm really tired of this ridiculous, unrealistic portrayal of women in movies from the past few decades."
2,Only finished watching it because I'd spent the money to see it,"Right up there with Snow White and the Huntsman as worst movie I've seen this year. Clearly, no one at Disney was paying attention as this debacle was being filmed"
2,Terd of a movie,Allthough the special affects were good this movie was a Terd bad acting and bad story line that is why we rent movies not see them at the box office
2,Wow what a dog and poor acting,"This movie should been called the John the jumping bean Carter, I never did figure out what the guys with octo arms were doing. Plots were thin been there and done that And actors were the worse no wonder it bomb. I ask if they were going to do number 2 ha ha ha what joke if they do. i say if you buy this movie and pay over $2.00 bucks for it your getting rip off good. I can only give it 2 stars and I am being kind at that."
3,John Carter,"I was anxious to see this film, but was a little disappointed. I love science fiction, however this movie was sort of over the top."
3,"I liked it,,,","and it was what it is,,,a little bit better than OK Sci-Fi and well worth the rental price.Would I watch again or buy it? No."
5,Great overall movie,"Saw the movie in theaters, and loved it. Great overall movie, and it is definitely one to buy for family movie nights."
5,A Fantastic Movie to Enjoy over and over on DVD & Blu-ray,"Considering the classic book, Andrew Stanton did a fantastic job of meeting the HIGH expectations of an audience that couldn't wait for this movie. Unfortunately it was horribly interpreted by Disney marketing who totally missed the timeless love story at it's center!!! Do NOT be put off by the critics reviews from people who clearly didn't even bother seeing the film.There are many of us clamoring for the planned sequels to this remarkable film. It is that good. Taylor and Lynn nailed these two iconic roles and I'm still in shock that Disney simply ""let it fail"" domestically. Shocking. Buy it and buy it for all your friends. They will thank you and maybe we'll get those sequels!!!"
3,Entertaining,"I might be easily entertained, but I think this flick is worth a watch. The story is pretty good and it has some notable actors. Plus Taylor Kitsch isn't bad to watch shirtless for a hour."
4,Extremely underrated,"I rented this move with not very high expectations. As a result I was extremely pleased with film. Visually, the movie is stunning. The streaming HD quality was excellent. I was really captured by the storyline and enjoyed every part of the film. It has action, drama, thrill, and humor all packed very nicely.i remember thinking to myself at the end of the movie how satisfied I was and then wanting more. I would watch it a second time just to experience complete enjoyment in a movie. Keep in mind, this is a complete sci fi film. So, if sci fi isn't your thing don't expect huge results."
3,An OK action sci-fi movie.,This was an OK movie. Great visual effects but don't expect Oscar winning acting. Not something I would see at the theater but OK for home viewing.
3,Slow,"This movie is visually nice to watch but the story is slow and even I wanted to kill the human. It was hard for me to get into and I was looking forward to seeing it. If you are bored, this movie is okay to watch."
3,"Entertaining for what it's aimed at, but a bit confusing...","Having not known anything about John Carter, I thought the movie was entertaining, but certainly a bit 'over the top'. But it was a good escape for an afternoon."
5,John Carter,"I've always been a fan of ERB's books included his Tarzan, Inner Earth, and Mars series so was very happy to hear that John Carter was coming out as a movie. I was a little apprehensive before seeing it fearing that it wouldn't live up to my expectations but I was so very pleasantly happy with it. I saw it in 3D and it was absolutely WONDERFUL and I can't wait for it to come out on dvd.The characters are great and interact well with each other, the story is good and there's plenty of humor, action and romance all of which holds your attention thruout the movie and leaves you wanting more at the end."
5,Great movie ... Needs a sequel.,Disney made a great movie on this one. Great science fiction and a unique story. I hope they continue to create more.
5,The Critics are blind,"I just read that John Carter was named as the top 10 list of the worst movies of the year. Having read the books as a kid, I was not dissipointed. I do not know what movie they were watching but I don't think it was the same one I saw. This is a great flic with all the elements of a classic Sci Fi movie. Thumbs way up from a Guy that actually pays to see movies."
5,I really liked this film,"I saw this in the theater when it was first released and I throughly enjoyed it. As so many others have mentioned, the marketing job was horribly botched and frankly, the movie title was just a mistake, ""John Carter of Mars"" would have made much more sense.But, the movie itself was great fun. I bought it on Blu-Ray recently and have watched it twice so far and enjoyed it each time...it's just a fun old time adventure and it looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray!"
5,Take me to Barsoom too!,"I first saw this movie, partially because of the horribly done preview, with great skepticism. As I watched the movie though, I was caught in the heroic and epic nature of the story. Stanton does a marvelous job adapting this time to the big screen. After I watched the film, I took my two daughters to go see it in 3D, which they loved! The story has all the elements of a great movie, drama, action, strong character development, thematic development, and scintillating romance. I went back to read the books, and have been thoroughly enjoying my read of this somewhat forgotten classic! I hope they decide to make the rest of them into movies!"
5,Awesome Movie,"Well worth the tiny rental fee. Action packed, visually stunning and the story line held my attention from start to finish. Maybe not for little kids, say 5 and under but the whole family will love grabbing some pocorn and sitting down for a family night watching this flick! Highly recommended!"
5,"Despite Title, Trailers, and Marketing- Great Film!!!","I didn't think that this would be that good of a movie. I was not aware of the books, so the name ""John Carter"" didn't really ring any bells. And the trailer I had seen did spark much interest either.But when I saw it, I loved it! It's a great science fantasy adventure, with a well-designed world and an interesting plot. And the ending leaves you wanting more!I quickly looked to see if sequels were forthcoming- but then I learned of the box-office flop- so buy this film, and maybe, just maybe we can see a sequel eventually."
5,John Carter,"During my teen years, I came across John Carter of Mars written by Edgar Rice Burrough and became fascinated by that book and the rest of the series. Now that it has been made into a mmovie, I have renewed my interest in the books as well. Them movie was up to my expectations and I ma hoping that this catches on and the rest of the 4 books becomes movies. Mr Burroughs wrote this book in 1911 and made this journey to Mars and back realistic. Although he was noted for the Tarzan series, his SiFi books were not to be under rated. They have captured my interest these 50 years later. I hope enough people get behind this so the rest of the books becomes movies.This movie is a must see for all SiFi fans."
4,Terrific Film,"In spite of inexplicable mass critical hatred, John Carter is a rollicking good time with some great action set pieces, and a significant amount of well-placed humor. Taylor Kitsch seems a bit young for the title role, but plays a credible John Carter with some excellent comedic timing of his own. If you missed it in theaters, this movie is definitely worth checking out."
4,The Problem Is The Story Line,"Overall I thought this movie was very well done. The only problem I could see was the story line itself was dated, knowing what we know about Mars and space. The screenplay should have been modified to make it more believable. They could have used a totally fictional planet and in that way open up any possibility. John Carter himself was inconsistent with his abilities throughout the movie. He could leap astounding distances and swing huge boulders around, but when fighting one of the natives he seemed weak. His unique abilities didn't jive with what was going on around him. The bottom line is that the story taken as a whole was good, the special effects were fantastic, and in the end I did care about the main characters."
4,very good,"I like these kind of movies, I don't care that it did not do well at the box office, i liked it."
4,This movie took off in the second half.,"I found John Carter hard to like at first because of his attitude of just wanting his cave of gold back on Earth. His stubbornness to help for the first half was just not likable, although I realize it was due to losing his wife and child. The movie did not emphasise this problem enough in the beginning to let me sympathize (until much later when more details were brought out about the loss) Then there was the continual beatings he took that were on the ridiculous side. Most of them because he was so stubborn. Also the situation between the different groups on Mars were confusing at first.When Carter finally came around and wanted to help by the second half, I started to like him. The movie got better the longer it went on. The ending was especially good. It was nice to see him transform into someone who cared about others. I enjoyed the special effects and the airships. I would watch the sequel if they make one. I'm giving this movie 3.5 Stars."
3,Uninspired but passable entertainment,"This wasn't exactly the great movie but it has a clever premise (based on an Edgar Rice Burrows novel) that is really kind of a victorian/old west era sci-fi story with strong parallels to James Cameron's Avatar. John Cater is transported to Mars while trying to escape conscription by the Army in their fight against Native Americans. There he is thrust into a similar situation, this one involving two warring human cities and another alien species that is caught in the middle and cares little for either side. The movie manages to make some social commentary while at the same not being heavy handed. I found it to be suitably entertaining with good dialogue and decent acting. The story starts to get bogged down a bit by its own tenuousness leading to a rather rushed and over-simplified conclusion but overall it's a pretty satisfying movie."
5,The Best John Carter So Far,"I love this movie..I read most of Burroughs' Mars books when I was a teenager and I hope they make more of them into movies. This version is so much better than the others, I guess we just had to wait for the RIGHT technology. Best on a big screen."
4,BARSOOM ADVENTURES,"THE GRAPHICS & SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE VERY GOOD. THE STORY LINE WAS ALSO GOOD,BUT ONLY IF YOU HAD READ THE BOOK. WHICH I HAVE,BEING A BURROUGHS LOVER.I,MYSELF,WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THIS SERIES MADE INTO MOVIES."
3,Action and sci-fi,"My daughter requested this for Christmas, and I'd like to see it again. Its one of those movies that has so much going on, that you can probably notice something you missed when you watch it again. Very unusual setup for a movie."
4,Captures the essence of the John Carter books,"So often Hollywood takes a book I have loved for years and completely trashes it (Starship Troopers by Robert H. Heinlein instantly comes to mind). This is not one of those cases. It's been a good 30 years since I read the John Carter of Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and time has faded many of the details from my memory, but this movie captures the ""look and feel"" of that character much better than I expected."
4,A Childhood favorite still entertains,"I read all of the Burroughs books as a kid. They took me away from the miserable day to day world of elementary school of the 50s to better and more interesting worlds. They inspired me to read about science on my own since what school provided was so light weight. As an adult the books are dated. However, I am now an avid sci fi reader and still a science nerd. I think this film will do for younger viewers what the books did for me; provide an entertaining and inspiring interlude. Loved the settings, the costumes, and the story line. I do not understand why this movie was poorly reviewed by the critics. For me it was much better than the under scripted Conan and the dull Thor. Give the film a change. At least on streaming it is a bargain."
4,forget the critics,"This is an amazing movie, really made me a fan of Taylor Kitsch. We want a sequel... blu ray is must-own"
5,One of the best,"I remember going to the cinema to go and watch this movie. I wasn't sure whether or not I would like it, but after watching it, it became one of my favourites! I honestly don't see how someone could rate this movie so poorly. Instead of listening to what others say, watch this movie first and then judge for yourself.Other than that, great movie! Would love to see a sequel."
4,movie download,I downloaded the movie to my Kindle Fire. It's just an entertaining action/adventure movie that I now can view anywhere/anytime
4,Better than the Reviews It Got.,"I don't understand why there was so much hostility to this film. Perhaps the three openings confused people. But once into the story, the film worked well. I liked the characters, the actors who played them, and the FX. I think if they had named the film Princess of Mars instead of John Carter it might have brought in more people. I don't know. This a good film, and one I recommend watched. You'll see that the openings are confusing yes, but as for the rest, well, just watch and see."
5,Great Movie,"I really loved this movie. It had great effects, score and acting. The battles were great. They could've made the movie 4 hours and I still would have been enthralled the entire time. It's a shame reviewers crapped all over this because they are idiots. I hope more people see this great movie so that one day we can see a sequel."
1,Never got to see it,Took too long to upload when we wanted to see it. Disappeared before we could see it. :( Had to add words to finish review:(
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"I was very disappointed in this movie. The acting was pretty shody & the story line was like a STAR WARS WANNABE, AVATAR without the epic features, and no credibility. Disney lost on this one!"
2,I couldn't wait for it to be over.,"I had heard this movie was bad, which made me want to see it. I thought to myself, ""It can't be THAT bad, can it?"" It can and it was."
5,Epic and Wonderful,"I'm truly baffled by the critical response to this movie. It's a fun and sweeping adventure, imaginative and enthralling. We need more movies like this!"
1,"I loved this underrated movie, but with this cover, it will make it a hard sell for anyone!","I loved this underrated movie, but with this cover, it will make it a hard sell for anyone!Just look at it. Did any thought go into it? Why couldn't we have a cover similar to the first poster sets? C'mon Disney! Dropping the ball AGAIN!"
3,"Good,but not great......","While I would say that ""John Carter"" was worth seeing, I must admit the book it came from, sadly, is a little dated. With Opportunity and Curiosity roaming the vast empty plains of the true Mars, it is hard for me to reconcile or suspend my belief to this. True, it had a great storyline, though a little hard to follow at times,good characters and great effects and for that reason I've collected it, Still, what was believeable in the thirties, forties and fifties, is not so much now in thr light of the Twenty-first century. If this had been a world other than Mars, and the timeline it was written, it would be easier to accept. It's a good movie, but not great."
3,"not enough 3D shots, sux","not enough 3D shots, sux, the movie I already had seen but not in 3D. so this rating is poor for 3D"
2,review,Was not at all impressed with this film.; either the movie itself or the story line. I would not recommend it.
3,John Carter,I was one of the few who liked this in a theater. Taylor Kitch (The name!!) is a good action star and has a crazy hot body. The design of the movie is posh fun. I have to say I found it a lot more difficult to stay with on TV than in the theater.
3,Not What I Expected,"This movies simply didn't bring it. There was what could have been a great Edgar Rice Buroughs-type plot, but it never happened."
5,Got it as a present!,"My grandpa is hard to shop for, and saw this movie and loved it! He didn't have enough money for it and was sad about it. So I got it for him for Christmas and he loved it! Good buy! Fast delivery!"
3,meh,Fun but not great. Some of the effects were well done but the story line was lacking too the point that the characters seemed more like cardboard cut outs.
3,haven't finished watching it yet,"Based on what I saw so far--I can say that it is probably fun, tho a bit too ""campy"" for my taste--which is part of the reason I haven't finished it yet. It's not something I usually watch, but the price was right..."
5,Will you fight for Helium?,"This is a Civil War Science Fiction Epic Love Story Classic between a mercenary and a Martian Princess. How could it go wrong? I was happy that this ended up as a Disney movie. Walt would be proud. This movie like the books will survive the test of time. "" John Carter, will you fight for Helium? "" This has a lot to say about the Military. 5 stars in my book.John Carter"
4,Not bad for a sci-fi flick.,"Bought this for my husband, as he's a real sci-fi addict, and actually found it quite entertaining myself. It has a decent storyline and the computer graphics were better than most I've seen. This is a movie that can't be judged on what other people think. You need to see it for yourself. Like I said, I found it quite entertaining, and there are very few sci-fi flicks I like."
5,"Amazing, epic adventure!","John Carter is an amazing adventure for the entire family. From the beginning shot of mars to the very end, you are swept away into an adventure that makes this film classic. The characters are lovable and the story is rich. Although many might be discouraged by the changes made from the original novels, they do not harm the film's story, they in fact enrich it. This is a success in my eyes, it is not a flop at all. Congrats to the team who worked hard on this!"
4,"Lots of action, needed a little more depth",Watched this with my husband and son and we all liked it but not the best movie we've seen. I'd recommend it for fun!
4,Great Flick,"I'm not sure why this movie was given so many bad reviews. It was a lot of fun.It's true, there were moments of ""cheezy-ness"" but the movie was full of action and really a bit different from other sci-fi movies.Plot: 5 out of 5 starsF/x: 4 out of 5 starscharacters/acting: 4 out of 5I think you will really enjoy the movie if you rent or purchase it."
5,Definitely worth seeing,"The promotion and advertisement of this film (upon release into the theaters) was just bad. The trailers I watched made no sense and I had no idea what this film was about so I never went to see it. Apparently, not many did. It's such a pity because once I watched it (amazon instant video) I found a wonderfully rich story nestled inside the packaging of a typical action/adventure. Oh, I think I like this! Then my family watched it and really liked it as well. It's a great family film. It was a job well done in terms of making a fun, entertaining family friendly motion picture that you can watch again. If only 'they' had promoted it properly - made trailers that illuminated the story better, maybe we'd have gone to the theater to see it - and then, maybe, they'd have plans to make a sequel. I very much would like to see 'what happens next' at the end of the film - in a sequel. Unlikely now.A great family film. There aren't many of them made these days. Definitely worth seeing!"
4,John Carter,It turned out to be a better movie than I thought it would be after watching the preview. Seems there is hope for the good.
4,john carter,I wasn't expecting to like John Carter as much as I did. But I found it to be a fun adventure and I did enjoy it.
5,Edgar Rice Burroughs fans!,"This script has been floating around in Hollywood ever since the late 1980's, even before Disney bought the Burroughs' rights. If you've read the John Carter series books, then this one does not disappoint, otherwise it will leave you wondering ... huh?"
4,Sneak Attack by John Carter,"Wow! Maybe because the Disney logo sits right above the title makes me think that everyone consider this a kid movie which probably led this to be an unpopular movie among adults. I haven't even heard of the movie when it became available for purchase on Amazon. The special effects are top of the line and the story makes me think there can be a sequel. John Carter was a surprise movie for me and its worth watching again, and again. But if you're not into Sci-fi then probably not a good fit for you."
5,Excellent movie,"I remember my Calculus instructor years ago telling me I needed to see the greatest movie he'd ever seen--""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I followed his advice and was suitably impressed. Then came ""Star Wars""--wow! Critics have said there is nothing new in ""John Carter"" that they haven't seen before in these movies. There's nothing new in any good story told since Socrates. It's in the telling, not the plot. This movie tells Edgar Rice Burrough's tale so very well with excellent acting, humor and believable aliens. If you've read the books and enjoyed them, you'll love this movie. I wish Hollywood would go back to more classic SciFi. Asimov, Heinlein, etc. done properly would be amazing!"
4,Classic pulp with aweome special effects,"If you're looking for a well-developed plot and deep character development, then you're going to have to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a classic pulp made real, or a completely fun Saturday afternoon cheeze fest, John Carter is for you."
4,Yes Good One,"This is a good movie. Again special effect. I love it. It gave a great ending that was not expected. Just wasn't ready for it. Start to finish had me going. I got it as a Instant Movie, but I shall buy the Blu-Ray."
1,john carter,"a crap movie,one of those movies were the 60 second preview, is the best part of the movie,very disapointed with this dvd,as they say never judge a book by the cover"
2,A guy without a shirt goes to mars.,"A guy without a shirt goes to Mars. He can jump ridiculously high. He uses his high-jumping superpowers to end a war and win over the princess. Yawn. Oh, and it's over two hours long, too."
2,2-Star Film,"My family watched this long movie. Put me to sleep several times during the movie. 18 year old daughter complained we should of watched something else. Wife was not impressed. I guess if you are a total fan of the books, then this might be good for you. Now we know why it bombed at the box office. The beginning had some funny, amusing moments, but then turned dull and slow. We love to discuss movies after we've see them...we had nothing to say after this one. This was done in mostly CGI. Avatar was a far superior movie. For all the money they spent on this you would think Disney could do better. This one is a yawner."
2,only good for when you're sick / hungover / have no brain cells functioning,"a few funny lines, some cool cgi, but really? what did you do to this story?wait for it to be free...."
2,FLAT MOVIE! Do not be fooled by the 5 star ratings.,"I for surely say I was. I have read all of the 1 star reviews and found they concurred with my own thoughts very well. I had no idea that this was based on any book series. After reading that ALL 11 books were in one film I now understood why there was no plot line, no depth to the story and no character development. The CGI was not very good. The dog like creature was the only thing enjoyable in it. Comparing it to a B movie was a bit unfair cause at least they have far more thought placed into them. Each to their own enjoyment I am sure however the 5 star folks here I imagine do not see many other movies."
1,Send this movie to Mars,Disney executives should be banned to Mars for this EPIC failure. What a piece of garbage. My kids left to go color and my wife left to go do the Insanity workout. The only reason I stuck around was because our family dog was snoring on my lap and I didnt want to wake her up.
5,an excellent movie for the whole family,"John Carter is an excellent movie. It is filled with excitement, action, unique visuals, excellent SFX and interesting characters. The whole family can enjoy John Carter again and again."
3,Good Movie If You Are Not Expecting The Book,"I made the mistake of reading the book before seeing the movie so I was hoping it would be closer. However, if you haven't read the book yet, then you shouldn't be disappointed. Overall, it was a good, fun story with a satisfying (actually better than the book) ending. It would be worth reading the book after seeing the movie as it will be easier to visualize the characters that were beyond my imagination when I read the book. I'm not sure why the movie didn't do better in the theaters as it is no worse than ""Star Wars"" as far as fantasy goes. Actually, the dialog was much better than ""Star Wars"" which to me is like watching high school drama class."
4,John Carter 3D DVD,"Had problems with the 3D on the DVD, Got it exchanged with no problems, Enjoyed the movie, but the 3D was not that much to be desired. Have seen better 3D."
4,Better than the credit given....,"If your a Sci-Fi fan this was rather enjoyable. It's a fun ride through a beautiful world. Yes, the story is light but definite worthy of the time to get away for a bit of good escapee entertainment!"
3,"Good Movie, But Must Be In HD","This was a highly entertaining movie, we had a family movie night and we all sat and watched it. Although the movie critics savaged it, I thought it was a very entertaining movie, great special effects and more than enough twists and turns to keep me engrossed until the very end. The lead actor gives an uneven performance, ranging from superior acting to ""wooden"" on occasions.I do recommend you watch this in HD or on Blu Ray to get the most out of it. We watched it on Amazon Prime Movie's standard ""reso"" offering and the quality was VERY poor. I frequently watch movies and series on the same media this was very poor quality indeed, I am surprised they offer it at such poor resolution, it was way less than VHS quality!Still, a great movie, we watched it twice and enjoyed it both times. (I deducted 2 stars for the poor resolution which took away from our ability to enjoy the special effects!)"
2,Very sad!,"Being as I have read the entire John Carter series I found this movie very lacking. It would have been beter if they had have made a series of movies. Hell, it would have been better if it had been a movie series of the sci fi channel. They tried to shove far too many things into the movie and just lost the whole story. If it had even been close to the books it would have been a twenty hour movie. I would have been far happier if they would have just split it into more movies. It came close to being a B movie. Nuff said!"
2,Great special effects,The acting was really bad. The guy who plays John Carter ruined the movie for me. I would watch it again just to see the effects though.
2,an unorganized disaster of a movie,"The effects were cool, some interesting characters... But what a catastrophic waste of a ton of money to make that film! I sat there confused most of the movie, and the ending was a huge let down."
2,Rather dumb movie,The movie has lots of rock em sock em action but it is completely devoid of intellectual content. Kids will enjoy it.
3,Was what you expect for an action Flix,"Kind of a dated story line since it is from an old book. However, it was enjoyable enough if you go in expecting it to be an action flix"
2,Decent Movie,"A lot of reviews out there already. Personally I thought the actor who played John Carter, Taylor Kitsch, was a joke. Even angry people have more than one emotion. The story line was OK, but wasn't developed. Something you would expect from Disney a good idea but poorly executed. An example is that he is not willing to fight for anyone, but he does anyway. There is a lot of materials I could tell you why I did not like it, but it is not worth it. I am glad I waited for the price to drop for it to rent, because it was not worth more than 2 dollars to watch. This movie is good for people who don't care about details in the stories."
3,"didn't love it, didn't hate it","The dog was great. He gave the movie an extra star. The jumping back and fourth between locations/times wasn't really needed. Would have been much cleaner to just have a simple story. I wasn't crazy about the ""Q"" like characters that could do anything and chose to meddle in the lives of lesser beings. Sometimes these types of fun entertainment flicks try to hard to be something they're not."
1,Language,"This was a good enough movie but one wouldn't expect tp hear GD in a Disney movie. I am very disappointed in that. Kids are exposed to this kind of stuff everywhere, it would be nice for parents to have one place where they can trust that their kids will not hear filth. Disney used to be that place but apparently not anymore."
2,"well, now I understand why this bombed...","lots of exposition, two leads who could not have been less compelling if they'd worn bags over their heads, CGI monsters who didn't make the final casting call cut for the bad Star Wars films I - III, Avatar fying scenes with steam punk machines replacing creatures...No wonder this movie tanked. Glad I only paid to download a showing, rather than have to look for a way to unload this turkey..."
3,About What I Expected!!!,"To me, this movie was okay to watch once. It had some funny moments, decent sci-fi action and an interesting storyline, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. A Civil War vet named John Cater is transported from our world to Mars by a strange medallion. He reluctantly agrees to help fight in the war to save the planet. If you like sci-fi epics, you might enjoy JOHN CARTER!!!"
4,Way better than expected.,"After all the grief this movie received following a dismal box office performance I did not have high hopes. Much to my surprise it turned out to be one of the better action flicks I have seen in the last couple of years. I am regularly disappointed by today's big budget action fare. JCM certainly exceeded my expectations. This is the third quality action movie I have seen this in the past month or so (Hunger Games and Avengers being the other two - both a bit better than JCM). Three in a year, especially this early in the ""summer"" season, is a rarity for me."
3,Keep the expectations low,"To be honest, keep your expectations at a minimum. The novel went through a chop shop. The descriptions from the book is accurate. But, read or do the audiobook first!"
3,Great Story not so Great Acting,I would like to say that I loved this movie but I can't. It has a great story line with the earthman being transported to Mars and meeting the inhabitants but the lead actor (I can't even remember his name) made it anything but enthralling. I'll try watching it again some time to give the poor guy another chance but I actually found it to be somewhat boring.
3,An Edgar Rice Buroughs Fan,"After reading the five John Carter books written by Edgar Rice Buroughs, I was not impressed at all with the movie. It may have been technologically sound; but, it did not follow the books very much. If they would have made this film in two or three movies it would have been much better. Too much of the classic novel's material was deleted! This was not even a ""Reader's Digest""-type version..."
4,Could have been 5 stars,"This could have easily been a 5 star movie with just a few minor changes. First drop the ""Disney"" label; this is not your typical Disney movie, at least not compared to anything released recently. Keep in mind when you watch the movie that it is based on material that was written 100 years ago, so the ""science"" is dated and seems silly at times. The plot could have been modified to make Barsoom a planet in another solar system, instead of Mars. Changing the location to somewhere other than Mars would have vastly increased the believability of the entire plot. Don't listen to the paid critics, when viewed in the correct context this is a very good movie."
2,Not at all like the books,It was really bad. I heard it wasn't good but thought maybe the reviews were exaggerated. They aren't. The original books are so much better.
5,Best Movie in Many years!,"The movie , Just plain rocks!I can't believe more people don't consider this a master piece.I just loved it!"
4,Warrior Spirit,"This is a Awesome movie, being a movie critic does not mean looking for the worst all the time or being the best at criticizing. this movie was awesome, I'm glad I did not listen to critics"
4,Decent Adventure film,"I am not familiar with the written story: I enjoyed the film because I expected it to be ""comic book"" in its approach to reality."
4,It followed the book,I am an ERB fan and this movie followed the book very well. The special effects were done very well.
4,Better than you think!,"John Carter got a bad rap from critics and not many people went to see it in theaters, but the ratings from dvd buyers and amazon comments says it all.The movie is much better than you would think, or what dumb critics would say in magazines and tv. Buy it or rent and see for your self!"
4,Much better than publicity,I watched this movie because someone recommended it to me but I had heard about the really bad publicity so wasn't expecting much. WOW I loved it! Maybe the critics were watching something else and got confused - really its well worth a look. Loved the story even if its been done before and loved the CGI. Just watch it and make up your own mind - some of these detractors maybe a little (sorry I mean a lot!!!) jaded. They after all canned the Star Trek movie with Chris Pine and I believe that was inspired as well.
4,"Not Blade Runner, but still entertaining.","The title of this review says it all. Science fiction's movie canon goes unchallenged, but still, this movie was good enough. Blade Runner, Gattica, Contact, these are still my favorites, but nonetheless I'm not displeased with my rental of John Carter. I was sufficiently entertained."
3,Not bad but not one to own,"I wonder if the scriptwriters bothered reading the novels or just got pieces of ideas here and there. The beginning is totally wrong and many other scenes are invented rather than taken from the novels which, a bit dated, are still fun reads and highly recommended. The movie succeeds best on its CGI elements. The acting is ok nothing extraordinary (ie, typical of the vast majority of today's films) but I must say that Lynn Collins is hardly ""incomparable"" (as she's continually described in the novels) as Dejah Thoris. The role could have been better cast. This is one to rent (especially once you've read the novels) and watch once as I doubt you'll care to see it again."
3,Not Quite The Disaster I Was Expecting,"Better than I would have expected, given the critical and box office drubbing the film took. There's at least a good story here, with a sense of wonder about it, and an epic scale. Though the film does tend to get overwhelmed with the special effects at times, and it does get convoluted almost as much as David Lynch's Dune. Some good actors are mixed into the cast, particularly Mark Strong, who always does such a fine job playing the villain or the heavy. The leads have a fairly good chemistry going on, and the aliens are- unlike a certain George Lucas prequel creation that annoys everyone- rather nicely rendered and not at all frustrating. I think the film requires close attention, and multiple viewing to really appreciate it."
5,Very Glad we got this!,We rented the John Carter movie and loved it so much we got the combo pk with 3D. Great movie and even greater with the 3D effects.
4,A little confusing but enjoyable,"I really thought this movie would be bad... but it was quite the opposite. It had great effects, awesome acting, and a good story. Even the ending was good enough for me... I know, I know... SHOCKING. You will get a little lost at the beginning cause it's a little heavy to start out... just have some patients. Once John Carter gets to MARS... the fun starts and it will be a ride you enjoy!!!!"
1,My least liked album.,"Of all the classical albums I have purchased (100+), this is the only one I regret buying. For me to listen to the 2 CDs in this set requires discipline. I could probably enjoy the instrumentals; I can hardly tolerate the vocal/spoken pieces. This is the only Bernstein I own and I would not recommend it. This one will probably end up donated to the local library where someone can enjoy/appreciate it."
5,Great,"This is the best Four Seasons ever recorded. The playing of Shaham is great as always, the OCO sound beautiful, and the sound is perfect."
4,Freed up valuable desk space,"This is my second Ergotron arm, I bought this one to hold my laptop. I got the first one because two of us were sharing one desk and our monitors ate up all our desk space. With one of these we could easily share a single monitor. That was several years ago and it's still working great - I wouldn't set up an office without one.All I really needed was an extra arm, so I do wish I could have bought just the arm without the base. But while you can find dual arm systems, no one seems to sell an add-on arm for single arm systems.But the new arm mounted fine on the old base and is working great. I keeps my laptop handy for when I want it and out of the way when I don't."
5,Who is David Hurwitz?,"This is the BEST recording of this work available! The Russian National Orchestra is, IMHO, the finest orchestra in the world today -- just listen to the passionate intensity from strings and the dark, expressive but also immaculate brass playing. Pletnev has a tight grip on the structure of the Symphony (which it needs), and the first three movements are given examplary performances. Not even Pletnev can do much about the unfortunate ending Tchaikovsky gave this piece, though.I admit that the recording of Manfred (though not of The Tempest) distances the horns and percussion rather unconvincingly. But even that cloud has a silver lining when it allows us to hear even more of those wonderful strings.The Tempest is just as wonderful -- perhaps even better -- and the recording here is unexceptionable.All in all, a wonderful Tchaikovsky experience"
2,Dull and derivative.,"The book was much worse than I had hoped. It amounts to a gradual revelation of the performance of unspeakable acts culminating in torture porn, put forth as horror. The writing is sometimes lyrical but the story has no depth. It lacks flair."
5,A read frightening beyond words,"Double lock the doors and windows, and keep several lights burning all night long. Jonathan Aycliffe (aka Daniel Easterman) has written the most frightening book you'll probably ever read. Without a doubt a classic. It's brief, precise, and moves like a runaway freight train to its climax. Awesome."
2,"Disappointing, cliche.","What a disappointment. I read this because of all the great reviews and I didn't even want to finish it. It was gettng increasingly silly and predictable and then with about 35 pages left to go, I just skimmed it. The twist is pretty obvious, I knew that would be it on about page one. The early parts of the book did have some good scares, genuinely creepy stuff but it really unravels at the end. Also, I know horror books can be OTT but really this one seemed bent more on disturbing you and grossing you out than scaring you. I've been on a horror book spree or a little while and the Haunting of Hill House was the only one that really seems to me what a haunted house book should be. This one was just too disturbing and not in a fun way. I threw it out as I'm not reading it again and my husband would be disgusted with it."
1,"Banal & Trite: Tired Advice on ""Style""","The fact that you are even looking for a book on style is proof that you are far too sophisticated for this book. It is filled with the dullest, most over-used ""style"" tips in fashion history - make your ""classic"" pieces neutral in color? change your look by changing your accessories? Mon Dieu! This is not advice on French style... this is recycled notes from 'fashion 101' pieced together from ancient advice and common sense. To add insult to injury, the pages are mostly filled with photographs of boring clothing ""combinations"" that were probably already dated before the book even hit the publisher's office."
3,Buy our jewlery...Please!,"This book has great pictures....but only of the authors!!!!The worst is on page 72. They say they are shopping at the Chanel boutique.O.k. then why does one of them have a SENSO(the security tag) on""Her"" clothes?It looks more like...Let's go to the boutique and PRETEND we are shopping.The book is not detailed and only a bit helpful.Plus, they keep pushing the gaudy costume jewelry they sell.Save your money and get it at the library."
3,Nice to look through but I wouldn't purchase this book,Obviously this mother and daughter shopping duo love clothes and there are some lovely things to see in this little book. The book though seems to be an excuse for the writers to go shopping in Paris and the greatest pleasure in reading the book is for the reader to imagine that they are doing the same!
1,Not Worth the Money,"I agree with the other poor reviews for this book. While the book covers some interesting history of french style and design at the beginning, the remainder falls short. The style is nothing new, suprising, or interesting compared to other style books available. You will look through this book once and long to sell it once finished."
3,Outdated,"As someone who has been to Paris many times and has many Parisian friends I find this book to be stuffy and out of date. Yes, true, there are still many women in Paris who dress in the ""old school"" way but the average woman on the streets in no way represents what these women are trying to sell. However, they do give some interesting advice that is classic and can be used and adapted for wherever you live or travel."
3,"I don't wear a brooch, do you?","Their choice of jewelry is gaudy. There are approximately 20 photos of the mother and daughter, and that's too many. On a positive note, it's a very nice quality book with good photography, similar to Chic Simple."
3,"C+, Mesdames","As other reviewers have noted, this style guide offers much in the way of lovely photographs of the mother-daughter author team. However, the ""how to dress"" information seems rather basic. What is quite interesting, though, are the sections on French fashion history, including brief histories on several famous French perfumiers."
1,Bad product,"I ordered one pack and the beans smell nothing like vanilla. Like some other reviewers mentioned, they smell rancid.UPDATEThe return was processed the same day, and I am satisfied with that. I got a weird email from the seller JR Mushrooms & Specialties though. ""Because the beans you received are far fresher and better quality than the supermarket vanilla beans many people are used to, its strength can take people by surprise. Please rest assured that the beans are not compromised, and are fine to use.""Uhh... No. The beans do not carry a strong smell at all. Only once you hold them right up to your nose can you feel a dull, rotten smell. It feels like this is old product, but since there are no dates on the packaging I can't be sure."
5,JRMushrooms - Vanilla Beans,"I ordered several packages of vanilla beans for myself and my sister. We both are very impressed with them and what a deal. We're both starting new batches of vanilla. Also, we received them very promptly. Thanks!"
5,"For People Who Know ""Vanilla"" is Not a Synonym for ""Plain.""","I've been doing my own vanilla extracts and vanilla sugar for about a year now, and I've gotten beans from a number of different sources, but I'm only going here from now on. These beans are consistently fragrant, plump, and pliable. I cannot recommend these high enough for both quality AND price. Win/win!"
2,Not what I expected,"I'm not sure if I just got a bad batch, but my vanilla beans so far have not been very impressive. When I first opened the package, it didn't have that lovely vanilla smell I was hoping for. Since it was the first time I had ever bought vanilla beans, I thought my expectations may have been off. I had bought the vanilla beans to make my own vanilla extract for Christmas gifts, so I went ahead and put all 15 of the beans in my bottle of vodka. It's been in the pantry for a little over a month now, and I am not impressed at all. It doesn't smell at all like vanilla extract. I am very disappointed. Needless to say I will not be giving out homemade vanilla extract for Christmas this year."
5,Love it!!,Always love putting vanilla bean in various recipes...so I gave it a try..second time purchasing from the same company didn't disappoint.
3,vanilla beans,"The beans came in an airtight pkg.\, but they are hard to scrape the beans out of the pods, as the pkg crushed the beans so tight you can't get the little beans out of the pods. a little disappointing for baking."
1,Just not good,I'm really confused because I see everyone else giving these vanilla beans excellent reviews which is why I ordered them. I could tell they were off as soon as I opened the packaging. They had a smokey odor to them and the flavor was completely off. Certainly not something I would add to ice cream or other desserts.Maybe I received a bad batch. They went into the garbage.
3,OK Vanilla Beans,The quality of these beans is OK. I mean it's not stale but it's not as fresh as some of the other ones I got from different sellers. I would buy them again because of the price but not if they're any drier. Good price for OK Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla beans
4,Good vanilla beans,"These arrived for me very quickly, and major props for the free shipping. They smell good, but are not as aromatic as some I've had. Good product! Much better to get these and put them in my freezer, than paying almost $10 for a single bean at the local grocery store. This particular package of 16 beans comes to less than $1 a bean. Will probably buy from this seller many times!"
4,great beans! needs better packaging,these arrived in bags that looked like they were vacuum sealed at one point but the seal must have broke.This wasn't a huge deal since I needed them right away. The beans were not dried out and still fragrant. They worked perfectly. had I needed to store them though I would have put them in a different container for storage
5,Best beans,I got the beans in vacuum sealed bag. The beans are very fresh and moist. I measured each bean is 17 centimeters or more. Highest quality as it is described.Highly recommended.
4,Sooo Excited!!,"I just recieved my beans and I am sooo excited. For one, I opened the mailbox and could smell the beans through the ziplock they were in plus the mailing package. I was worried, because the cost was so low compared to store prices, that they would be less of a product. Well if the smell denotes the quality then Im in excellient condition. I gave it only 4 stars because I have to test it first in order to give it 5 stars. But I'm feeling confident that the extract I make will be great. Thanks much!! Iwill try to remember to give a review after 3 months, the time they say it takes to make extract, to let you know how it went."
4,Just Perfect!!,I got the Vanilla Beans 5 days after i placed my order! For free shipping i thing is a great deal !The beans where on a plastic seald ziplock 16 beans like where inside the beans where not to thin and the Aroma is just perfect after i opend the box my whole kitchen smeld for hours !it's missing just lil on taste but if you had not a lot exp with vanilla beans you don't even notice it .All in one a great deal !!! The price is perfect the free shipping is great i'm very Happy with my order i recomend it to everyone who need's beans for the right price!only one thing i would rec to the company to find a dif. type of container to shipp it cause if there is a whole in the plastic bag the beans could dry out and it would be sad ....Thank you again very much !!!
5,Gorgeous Product!,"I received the beans on Christmas Eve and opened them yesterday, to make homemade vanilla. They are lovely! All the beans are plump, moist, and supple. This was a very wise purchase and one I am certain to make again."
5,Best Vanilla Beans,"These are the best Premium Vanilla Beans you will find, and at a unbelievable price.I looked all over for the best price and JR Mushrooms & Specialties arein my opion unbeatable. Most places I found only offered half the quantity of beansfor the same price JR Mushrooms & Specialties offers, It's like getting 50% off all the timewithout them even being on sale,and these are FRESH VANILLA BEANS, real fresh.I have since ordered two more packages.KEEP UP THE GREAT QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE JR."
5,Amazing product,"I followed the recommendations from the other reviewers and I'm happy I did. I ordered the beans on a Thursday night, they shipped Friday morning, and I had them in hand Monday afternoon. They were plump and so fragrant and full of flavor. Vanilla beans are so expensive in the store, but at about a dollar a bean, these were so worth it. I'll definitely be ordering again."
4,Pretty good,"These beans had a good scent to them and came in quite fresh. They weren't as strong as the beans that I had gotten from Whole Foods, but those beans are $6 each. Good buy."
5,Fantastic Value!!,"I use vanilla beans all the time and if I had to get them at the grocery store, I'd be shelling out between $3 and $7.50 per bean! These beans are delicious and an amazing value. Do not buy these if you only use 1 vanilla bean every year for your wonderful Christmas pudding, they won't last forever. But if you use them often, have no qualms about these! Be sure to keep them in air-tight packaging and if you have a vacuum-seal system, that's a great way to store them each time to preserve their freshness."
5,Ideal for Gourmet Vinalla Bean Ice Cream.,Very good quality. 2 beans will make almost a half gallon of vinalla bean ice cream. We use the Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker. The price is very good compared to what you get in the grocery store and they are fresher than what I would get in the store. They arrived vacume sealed. I've just placed a second order for more. Loved em'
5,Awesome!!!!!,Great product gonna place another order right now! Fast shipping making homemade vanilla extract for Christmas gifts so excited... Homemade gifts are the best!
3,A little less than expected.,"I bought these to make vanilla sugar. Although they were pretty fragrant, I didn't get the result I'd hoped for.Shipping was fast and they were well packaged."
2,Disappointed!,"Hello, I want to start by saying that I don't enjoy giving a product 2 stars! I don't have a lot of background experience with vanilla beans. The one experience I DO have is that I bought one vanilla bean from my local health food store ($6)and I brought it home in a little baggie, twist tied at the top. My whole kitchen smelled wonderful when this one bean was on my counter in a bag. When I received my 16 vanilla beans, I opened up the package waiting to be hit with that wonderful aroma I had smelled before. NOT EVEN CLOSE! I was upset, but very busy at that time. So I put them aside for about four or five days. Then I used them to make vanilla bean cupcakes, the same recipe I used my first vanilla bean for. I couldn't taste vanilla at all. When I had made it before people were amazed at the unmistakable flavor. What a waste!Sorry for the long way around the story, I'm still upset..."
3,Seem good to me,"I am no expert on vanilla, but these beans seem very good to me! Extremely fragrant. Nice and moist and oily.*Update: the beans I didn't use immediately got extremely moldy and foul smelling within 4 months (not sure exactly when it happened). They were stored in the sealed bag in the cabinet. I would suggest that they come with instructions to use immediately (or the expected shelf life) and proper storage instructions. These were purchased from Olive Nation, aka JR Mushrooms. I may try a different vendor next time. Changing from 4 to 3 stars."
2,Good but disappointed,"First of all let me say the beans came quickly, were packed adequately and were priced right. They looked and smelled fine, not too dry and decent amount of aroma. They probably would have been fine for cooking, but they did not perform up to my expectations. I have been making Vanilla extract for the last 5+ years or so and that's why I bought the beans. I make 750mL at a time using vodka as the base. I cut up 4 beans and began soaking them a week before Christmas. After 2 weeks the extract was not strengthening correctly (too light of a color) so I added 2 more beans. Now that it is the end of January (over a month of soaking) they still have not extracted properly. I have the last batch to compare it to (different beans -- I believe Tahitian) and the current batch is half the shade and strength of the previous with 50% more beans. So I will go back to the more expensive Tahitian beans."
5,Look no further for Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla beans,"Look no further for Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla beans!These vanilla beans are the best I have seen or used. Very good price and great service.Too bad we are only limited to 5 stars for a rating, as JR Mushrooms & Specialties deserves more.D. Crossley"
5,"Beans , beans and more beans",This is a great company. My vanilla beans came promptly and very fresh. Beans are packed in an air tight package. I am an ongoing customer. Will be ordering more in April for my next batch of vanilla extract.
5,Great Beans!,"I purchased the vanilla beans from JR Mushrooms and Specialties to make homemade vanilla extract. The beans were in fantastic shape, smelled delicious and were packed correctly to keep fresh. JR Mushrooms shipped them very fast and have a website with info on different things to use the beans for. My vanilla extract has turned out AMAZING and in fact I will be making more to give as holiday gifts."
5,Great Price for a Great Product,I had never bought vanilla beans and was very pleased with these and the fast delivery. In the process of making homemade vanilla extract. Can hardly wait for the day I can try it!!
5,Great product!,"I bought these to use in making pure vanilla extract. They came quickly, well packaged, and very fresh and moist! They have a great scent/flavor and worked perfectly for my project! Will be back for more. :)"
5,"Fresh, plump vanilla beans","I'm making vanilla sugar and vanilla extract with my beans. This was just the right amount of beans at a good value. Usually to get a lower price, you're faced with having to order more beans than you really need, which then turns out to be a waste. The beans arrived fresh, plump and moist. Nice."
5,Great buy!,"These beans are much cheaper than what I found at area stores & they are of high quality. I used them for making vanilla extract and, although I haven't tried the extract yet (it's not quite ready), it smells absolutely lovely."
5,Best bang for your buck,"Fragrant, well-packaged, and I believe it's the most beans you can find for the $ on Amazon. I'm quite pleased and I LOVE seeing the little flecks of vanilla in my puddings/whipped creams, etc.!"
5,Fantastic!!!,"These beans are plump and VERY affordable! They have an amazing flavor, and are much better than some of the other beans I tried."
4,catch crabs,"Nearly everyone at my marina owns Charlie's book. It's both informative and fun. Crabbing is a simple sport. This is a simple, clear book.I recommend it.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
5,How to Catch Crabs,This is a fun book to read. It covers catching crabs where the author lives. I live in Northern california and fish from piers. The book would be good for somebody that has a boat.
4,Great for quick clean-up!,"This is a great product if you have hardwood floors and a dog! Excellent for getting into small spaces especially around toilets and under beds. This is good for quick clean-up, but not good for deep down grit or dust in rugs."
3,How do you disconnect the floor attachment to use the crevice tool?,"I bought this little creature at a yard sale, thinking it would be very convenient for touchups, but want to use the crevice tool. There was no manual, of course, and I just can not find a release to allow the floor attachment to be disconnected so I can attach the crevice tool. Help!"
2,Not impressed with product,"I bought this small vac because I thought it would be perfect for cleaning my carpeted stairs. Despite all the positive reviews, I found this product lacking. It's fine for picking up onesy twosy items, but it really does not do a good job when you are trying to vacumm an extended area (i'm only talking about the size of a stair). I find that most of the items that are somewhat attached to my carper or very small pieces of lint tend to stay in the carpet.Also, the wide ""vacuum"" attachment is useless. The suction hole is only about two inches wide and that is the only place it will pick up anything with that attachment. You might as well just use it as a hand vac to pick up articles that have some bulk.Was it worth $20? For the value I am getting out of it I do not think so."
2,One Major Problem,I thought this product had a nice feature set and it would have if it didn't have one major flaw. It leaks! The casing around the filter isn't properly manufactured (that's basic development!) and therefore dirt and dust leak out of it. I wouldn't recommend this product as there are other comparable products out there that do the same thing.
5,Great lightweight vacuum for hardwood or tile,"This vacuum is very lightweight and great for use on any non-carpeted area. It is so much easier to use than dragging out a large vacuum. As expected, it does not work very well on carpet."
5,Great ..Just as advertised,Works great on dog and cat hairs and everything else.easy to use and clean...could use a holder for attachment
2,kinda sucks,"I guess it sucks to some extent, but not as much as you would like, but then again it was cheap. I bought this for a mother in law that is in health care hospital type home. She it never happy with how clean her room is, and has no real space to store anything bigger. This gives her something to do, and makes her happy that she has a clean area."
1,don't buy this elec broom,Didn't like this elec broom at all. Hard to empty & floor attachment too big. I gave it away to a friend.
2,Don't waste your money!,"Bought this vac to help keep up with the cat litter on my bathroom runner. The suction is ok but there are too many design flaws on this product. First, the handle doesn't collapse so forget about storing it easily. Also there is no agitating brush. The biggest problem is the way the filter fits in it. Instead of resting in the cup when it is taken apart,it stays on the motor side. This means it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove it without shaking dust off of it and all over the place(including your face!) Also the filter has to be put back EXACTLY right which can be difficult and frustrating, or else the vac won't go back together.So in conclusion, if your looking for a small lightweight vac, you'd be better off spending your money elsewhere."
5,Bissell Stick Vac,"This is a great, lightweight vacuum. It's sturdy, powerful, and easy to use. We use it on hard floors and area rugs. For 20 bucks, you can't beat it because most of the rechargeable batteries on cordless units cost more than this vac."
3,good for small things,this is good to pick up hair and little tiny things. doesnt do a great job at picking up average sized things. but works well for what i use it for
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I needed something lightweight to pick up the debris my dogs track in and leave on the hardwood and vinyl flooring downstairs. This is perfect for the purpose. And it's easy to empty. It performs much less well on carpet, but I have a standard vaccum for that. So I'm happy."
4,Good for the price,"I bought this item so that my little girl can take some responsibility of cleaning up after her self. It is light weight but a little louder than I expected. Also, I thought that it would clean the carpet a little better than it did. Although, this may be because of the type of pile my carpet has. All in all, it is doing the job in which I intended to use it for. I use it daily in my living area because that is where the most traffic is, and my little girl loves to use it also. It is much better than dragging out the ""big"" vacuum clean daily. (That has been reduced to once a week!)"
3,Suction loss,"Suction loss is a big problem with the Featherweight Vacuum. After 5-10 minutes of continuous vacuuming, you notice that it stops picking up dirt and hair.You remedy the suction loss by unplugging the machine, popping open the canister, emptying it, replacing the air filter, and snapping the canister back to to the handle. In more than one instance, I had to struggle to open the canister and close it properly so that the hinges fall into place.Literally, this is a hand vacuum with a detachable ""floor attachment"". This is not a true hard floor cleaner."
4,camper vacuum,"Nice compact vacuum, great for the Camper, you can take the handle off and it stores great in an RV, but not big enough for a busy house like mine. I would buy a bigger one for my house."
4,Great Value,I bought this for my son to be able to vacuum floors as a chore and it is very easy for him to handle and works great. Only wish it would store more dirt.
2,vacuum,"It is a nice light weight vacuum that is great for floors but not carpet unless it is lightly dirty. Does not pick up dog hair at all! Otherwise it is a good little vaccuum to put in our basment for light use,"
5,extremely satisfied,After looking at all review of different vacuums I tried this one. I am very happy with it. It cleans all little jobs easily and is easy to store. Does what it says it can do. Suction is very good. Thanks.
3,It sure is a lightweight...,"This lightweight vacuum has an appropriate name; it's definitely a lightweight in the suction department, and thus, can be used effectively only for thin carpeting or bare floors. It fails rather miserably at sucking up dirt from thick, plush carpeting. I also don't like the way the floor attachment drags and skips over thin carpeting or small area rugs. This skipping prevents the vacuum from sucking up dirt and lint in a clean motion.I would recommend this lightweight vacuum only for people with bare floors or very thin carpeting/rugs. It is one step above a small handheld vac like a Black & Decker Dustbuster."
2,SCRATCHES PERGO FLOORS!!!!!,At first I loved this vacuum. It works great on picking up loose dirst all over my Pergo floors. Fast forward a few months and I hate the thing. I have noticed small scratches all over my floors. I first thought my son had scratched it with one of his toys. We sorted through the toys and discarded any suspected item.s It didn't stop the scratches. So last night I tested the vacuum on a not so obvious part of the floor and guess what........ the wheels scratched my floor. Unless you go in a perfectly straight line the floor is gonna get scratched. Be careful when considering this purchase for use on Pergo.
3,"Okay for hard floors, No good for rugs or carpet","Works fairly well on hard floors, but not at all on any type of carpet, or floor covering."
4,Bissell 3106A Featherweight Lightweight Vacuum,"I use this to touch up in between deep cleanings. The product has decent suction, is extremely light, and easy to use. It's a great size/weight for kids to use. You MUST empty the dirt cup and shake out the filter after each use. It's basically a powerful dust-buster in stick-vac form, and the detachable dust-buster function is handy. All in all, a good value for the money."
2,This vacuum did not work for us,The suction was weak to begin with and got worse over time. It's so bad now that I can't even use it anymore. This is cheap for a reason. This vacuum lasted me only about 4 months. It was a lousy piece of junk.
1,It shouldn't be called a vacuum machine,"The suction is so low that it doesn't pick up anything you can see. If you actually want to clean your room/house, do not buy this - it will have no visible effects."
3,Lightweight sweeperTr,Truly lightweighy and easy to use but I am not pleased with accessing the filter to clean it out nor it's tiny size.
5,Sweet!,"Wasn't too sure about this product due to its size and weight. However after reading other reviews, I decided to give it a try while it was on sale for $17.00. Got it - easy to put together and use. I was amazed how smooth it was over carpets. It definitely picked up a lot of dust off the carpet. Use it in the kitchen too where it works great on tiles/hardwood floors. My daughter who is 2 loves help out with it too. Its not a heavy duty vacuum but trust me it gets the job done in the same efficient manner!"
4,Light stick vacuum with lots of good sucking power,The only negative is that the cord is a bit short and we have to use an extension cord to really clean the house.
2,Don't Expect Much,"I could deal with all of the short-comings that have been mentioned, except the dust collecting on the outside of the unit. This has to mean the dust is just coming back into the room Thank goodness it only costs $20.00. I won't go to the hassle of returning, but I will probably donate.It picks up sufficiently, and is light.Just fine if you can figure out a way to deal with the dust apparently coming out of the unit. :)"
2,Not impressed,"I bought this vacuum to help sweep up our all hardwood floors house. The reviews of this product were so good, but I wasn't impressed. It is impossible to use on rugs, the suction is OK, but it's pretty inconvenient over all - cord gets in the way and isn't very long, small cannister needs emptied after every use. Plus, when I use it, it gets coated with a thick layer of dust. So, it seems all the dirt is just getting sucked off the floor and spit out the top of the vacuum. Just easier to get out the broom and dustpan. Perhaps a battery charged unit would fit my needs better."
4,"Does the job, but cup doesn't contain the dirt.","The price was right. Inexpensive and lightweight and does the hardwood floors and area rugs okay. However, when it's time to empty the cup, be careful when opening it! All the dirt just falls out instead of being contained. Open it over the garbage pail to ensure there's no additional mess to vacuum up!I think the Eureka ""The Boss"" is better if you can find it."
4,Very light and easy to use,This is a nice little vacuum. It loses a star because it cannot handle fuzz on carpet. It does great however on hard floors. So if your looking to constantly vacuum carpet I'd choose a different model.
2,What a messy item!,"You will be very annoyed every time you go to empty this thing. Really, on a bare floor a broom and a dustpan do a much better job. On household carpeting it is just OK, but there is still that emptying problem. What a mess! I tried it on the carpet in my car, too, and it left a lot of particles because of the pickup unit being too wide. Not a good deal."
1,Don't let those high ratings fool you,"After doing research and seeing high ratings for this, I bought it for my small apartment.It is a major disappointment. The power is so weak, it barely picks up a thread on the carpet. It was really useless because it didn't vacuum anything. I wish I could return this product because it was a waste of money."
3,Can it pick up lots of hair on carpet???,Hi Bissel users. I am getting this for only one reason and want to make sure it'll serve the purpose. I rent and we have plusch carpet. My hair sheds a lot and so right in front of the bathroom door the carpet is getting dark from all my hair whereas the rest of the floor is cream. I am just concerned about sucking up all the hair on the carpet spanning about 6-8 feet but of course it'd be awesome if i cuold use it for the rest of the carpet. can this do the job?? Thanks!
2,Vaccum,Maybe I am a little dense but to vacuum carpet its such a pain. Its like working against the grain. It picks up fine on tile but not on carpet. Maybe I just dont know how to use it but this is not good if you have carpet unless you want a workout pushing this across the carpet.
3,Not so powerful as mentioned.,Easy to handle and assemble. But the unit is not as powerful as mentioned. Suitable as secondary standby vaccum cleaner for small cleanup.
1,It broke the first time I turned it on.......,It made a horrible clunking noise and then stopped running. It is too awkward to repackage and pay for return shipping or to ship to the manufacturer. I won't buy from Amazon again or at least not unless it's the only place to get what I want. Sorry........
2,No Suction On Carpet,"I have now reverted back to using a broom and dustpan on my carpet, as that is more efficient than this vacuum."
3,handy for my dorm,"I like this vacuum, my suitemate and I share it in our dorms. its convenient, light, and it does the job. the only thing that i don't like is cleaning the filter. it doesn't come with a bag so dust sometimes flies all over the place. I wouldn't get it for a huge house, but i love it for my dorm. :)"
3,hard to clean,had a similar model different brand for years which wore out. the old one was much easier to clean the filter. make sure the bissel is over a basket before you clean it.
4,Bissell 3106A Featherweight Lightweight Vacuum,"This is a good, very reasonably priced, lightweight hand held stick vacuum cleaner. It's long enough to reach most areas without bending, except that the switch is placed so far down on the unit that bending is required to turn it on and off. It has multiple easily exchanged nozzles and crevice tools."
3,Bagless Vac,"I bought this vacuum thinking it would be great for my tiny apartment. I think it would be awesome if I had all wood or tile floors, but I have a low-pile type carpet. When I try to suck up big things with the vacuum, it just sort of nom nom noms them all over the floor and then spits them back out. I've actually had better luck just picking up all the big things and THEN vacuuming, which is a big fat pain in the neck. I think I'll replace this with a heftier vacuum as soon as one presents itself for a reasonable price.If I remove the floor vac piece, and convert it to handheld, though, it works a lot better. I think I got what I paid for, though, because this vacuum was cheap cheap cheap."
5,Best there is,"I love this compact, light, reasonably priced, multi-task vacuum. I moved to a 650 sq ft condo with bamboo and tile flooring & got rid of my heavy duty Hoover that worked great for years on carpet. I needed a handy and easy to use vacuum. After researching for days, I found this! Thought I couldn't go wrong with the price. It exceeds my expectation. I especially love the attachments. It's like having 3 tools in one. It's powerful and very easy to clean the filter. I'd buy this again and highly recommend to others considering to buy this too."
2,Not Very Powerful,"This is not the most powerful vacuum. It's strong enough to pick up dust, hair, etc. from bare floors, but it leaves larger particles behind. It's not powerful enough to do anything on carpet. The cord is about half as long as it should be; we had to use an extension cord to vacuum our SMALL kitchen and dining room."
5,I love it,"I bought mine years ago for $20...it's like a powerful long handled dustbuster. It doesn't hold a lot of debris, but it IS pretty strong. The floor attachment comes off and the handle breaks down to use it as a hand held vac. Also comes with a crevice tool. Get some extra filters and you'll always have it ready to go. The filters rinse out in the sink or blow off with an air compressor. I wash mine and let them air dry. No BENDING over. The cord isn't real long, but for the price I am really pleased!"
3,pretty good little broom,It works well on my bare wood floors and gets into the grouting around the tile in my kitchen better than a broom. I find that you need to move it slowly to give it a chance to pick up. Nothing bigger that a piece of dry dog food.
2,"Poor suction, don't even bother using it on carpet","I've used this vacuum a couple times to vacuum my carpeted dorm room, and I can't recommend it for anything other than the lightest dust and particulate matter. Perhaps all the other happy reviewers are using it on vinyl or hardwood or something, but on carpet it utterly fails. I still have lint and clumps of dust after making a couple passes, and in the end I just gave up. Right now I'm trying to find a better vacuum without dishing out the hundreds for a Dyson Slim.What's good is that it's quite portable, and emptying it is simple though potentially messy. Make sure to empty the vacuum fairly often to maintain what little suction it has."
2,"Cheap, but doesn't work well","I wanted to use this as a vacuum in my dorm and the price was great so I thought I would give it a shot. It really didn't pick up enough dirt and it wouldn't pick up any hair at all. I have low pile carpet so I thought it would work - wrong. I ended up buying a regular bagless vacuum and this Bissel featherweight is sitting at the bottom of my closet as a back up (at least it doesn't take up much space.) Bottom line: if you need a vacuum, buy a real one."
4,Hard working vacuum,"It's perfect for my NYC apartment with parquet floors. Haven't used it on rugs though. Picks up hair and dust quickly and doesn't seem to lose suction for a while. Even if I chuck it after a couple of years, I'll feel like I got good value out of this products"
4,I love my new Bissell!,"This is a great product! It's very easy to use and has a lot of sucking power so even small crumbs are gone instantly! I love the light weight and ease in dumping the collection. The only thing I would change is that I don't like the ring of dust around the collection container. Otherwise, it's amazingly perfect!"
3,I'm thinking I could have done a bit better,buying this made me stop being cheap and buy a real vaccum - its a dust buster on a stick basically ..... and dust busters just dont work that well ...
4,Featherweight Lightweight Bissell 3106A vacuum,"It's convenient, very lightweight, easy to use and has very good suction. It is kept handy and used every day to pick up crumbs, dust, etc., on our hardwood floors. It's very easy to empty the bagless container. We had hoped that this vacuum would have a thicker brush to protect new hardwood floors. Since it is advertised as a hardwood floor vacuum we assumed it would have a soft brush that would gently touch the wood floor. Instead, it has hard plastic wheels with a short, firm brush. It hasn't scratched our new floors yet, but we worry and try not to press down when we are vacuuming the floor."
4,"I was surprised, it's really great!","I seem to have bad luck with vacuums. I am always hoping to find something to make my life easier. I have tried a few portables and was really disappointed. This was a doorbuster at Wal-Mart, so for 12 bucks I figured what the heck? It is very powerful, sucked more kitty litter than my big vacuum. It got all the cat hair and crumbs off of my hardwood floor. It is definitely not for carpet, but it is permanently replacing my broom! The dirt cup was a little messy, but I will be more careful about holding it over the trash completely next time."
4,Good for hardwood floors,I like this vacuum because it's very light and I use it almost every day. It's great for hardwood floors because of the dust that accumulates which is difficult to sweep up with a broom (just blows around). This little vacuum does the trick. My steps are also hardwood and it's much easier to vacuum them with this little gem. Very lightweight. My only complaint is that the cord is not long enough. I empty it after each use (according to the instructions) and I believe this keeps the suction strong.
2,Doesn't pick up cat hair or stray litter or particles...so...,"I previously reviewed this item and basically said it was decent for the price. After a few months of watching my carpet get cluttered with cat hair and whatever else this hunk of plastic wouldn't suck up I realized you can't be skimpy about vacuums if you want the job done right. I finally went to Target and bought the Dirt Devil Vibe, a VERY impressive bagless with excellent hand-held extensions for $80. Four times the price of this one but...it actually works."
2,Not that great a buy,"It's quite an ordeal to use this machine. I mean it's light and all, but it doesn't really do a great job on a carpet floor. Might as well spend a few more dollars and buy a better one!"
1,Are you kidding me? Save your money and time.,"This vacuum has great suction. Unfortunately, the dirt/dust it sucks goes straight into the air. This thing actually set off my smoke alarms. What doesn't make it into the air builds up inside the vacuum parts, not the dust bin. I have never seen such a poor performing vacuum before. The dust filter is pitiful and the dust bin doesn't completely close tight, which adds to more dust in the air. The cord is also too short unless you're planning to vacuum within 8 feet of an electrical outlet. Suction and price were better than expected but that means nothing when the dirt/dust goes into the air. Thankfully Amazon has an easy return policy."
2,You get what you pay for,"When you consider how much a broom costs, this is not a bad deal. However, the feather weight is very limited in what it can do and how much it can hold. After playing around with it for a few months, this is the plan of attack we've come up with. We leave it plugged-in in the living room, the wide nozzle is off and we use it about twice a day to pick up dog hair. We have a big dog and bare floors so it works well without the wide floor attachment. Cleaning out the canister is a nasty proposition, though. If it was just the dog hair, that would be one thing, but it picks up lots a dust, which ordinarily would be a plus, but the emptying process usually means another cleanup at best, or a face full of dust at worst. I think I'd be happy to pay twice as much if it came with 100 cheapy little bags that could be thrown away if it meant a cleaner cleanup.Also, the wide attachment is useless except for giving the vac a wider base to stand on."
5,A MUST for quick clean ups,"My whole house is hardwood, and this little picker upper really sucks. In a good sense, of course. With five dogs, I need to run the vacuum often, and haven't in the past because just the thought of dragging out the HUGE vacuum we have was just as painful as the action of dragging out the HUGE vacuum. Often, my vacuum sessions left me with a sore back, and missed nooks and crannies. I like this little vacuum because it gets places the huge one CAN'T. Like under some of our furniture and in between the stove and wall.Granted, it doesn't have the suck power of our 12 amp vacuum, but for the light package deal you get, this little guy is well worth it. Plus, the price is right! AND it is small and easy to store."
2,"Dissapointed, not opwer enough","I bought this product following all those good reviews. I dont know what's other people's need but all i wanted is a vacuum that can get all the dust. I wasnt looking to pick bigger stuffs. Just dust.But, when i use it, it doesnt have enough power. It wont get to corners or edges because suction is not power enough. If you're using the hand version, you need to be very close to the surface and even that way it wont take all the dust off, so i still have to sweep or use other tools.I guess its only 20, but at least it should do one small thing good."
2,Simple and not for heavy Cleaning,"It works well for simple cleaning like floors, Sofa's. On carpets, it doesn't suck the particles stick to carpet. Not a good choice to pick hair on carpet. Better choice something which does better cleaning."
5,Excellent So far,"Got this in Amazon for 17 bucks including shipping. Initially was a bit skeptikal, but impressed with its performance based on its size,cost. Works well obvisouly dont expect to work like havy duty stadium cleaner.. Good for studio/at best Small 1br apparmtents."
2,Lightweight yes - worth it - maybe not,"I've had this item for a year. I've actually pulled it out maybe a dozen times.Yes it is lightweight which is one of the reasons I purchased it. I needed something to get bird seed off my carpet between heavy cleanings. This does not do it. Nor does it work on feathers. As a matter of fact, I don't have good luck with it picking anything up on carpet unless you go over it a lot and use lots of pressure. Sometimes it's faster to just pick up the little thing.I have to agree with others - it just kinda pushes larger things around. I'm here today looking for a replacement cuz I think this one is going to Good Will."
5,Great Vacuum for Hard Floors!,"This works very well on our tile floors. I imagine that it would work just as well on any hard surface. It's not as easy to move on our carpet, but the hand-held vac on a stick is still great on carpets!"
4,Great Product...,"for me. I use it everyday to take care of dog hair on area rugs, dust and general debris of everyday life. I clear the vacumn every other day to ensure enough suction. It is bagless. It is so light and can be use as a broom.I would recommend the product to everyone as a light use vacumn or an alternative to hand vacumn. The pricing is attractive, too."
4,great for the price,"arrived fast, great little vacuum, the only issue I have is holding on to the attachments when not in use, but other that... great for a fast clean up and the price? excellent"
5,great for camping,"I LOVE IT!!!I bought this for my camper, I hated using a broom. It works great gets all the grass, sand, dirt, whatever the kids drag in. I wasn't sure at first if it would do the trick, but it does!!I even bring it in the house when we are not camping and use it in my kitchen. I love it!"
2,Is this for you?? It wasn't for me!,"I was disappointed in the lightweight vacuum by Bissell. I havelaminate wood flooring in all but my family room and bedrooms. I have 2 small dogs and they constantly bring grit and grass in from the yard and I thought it would be a quick cleanup. I should have saved my money. It picked up the grass, but no way was it going to pick up the little grit that my other vacuum cleaner would have done.It just wasn't powerful enough. It didn't cost much, so I don't feel like I lost much, but I was hoping for much better. It is lightweight, though. For finer dirt this is not the vacuum -- save your money. If it's kids cereal, grass, other little pieces of stuffthis may be what you need!!"
5,Handy sweeper,"I am very happy with this vacuum. It is light weight but has good suction for a broom vac. I have a bamboo area rug that was very dusty and it sucked all the dust out. I could see the rug getting darker as the dust was removed. It's also very easy to clean the dust bag out only one button and it snaps apart. You do have to clean the bag after each room.Great for wood, vinyl and any other smooth surface."
2,Not What I expected,I purchased this vacuum to use mainly on stairs and for light duty since my bigger vacuum was too big for stairs etc... The vacuum does not suck well at all. Would not recommend this item.
5,Bissell 3106A,Very good item. I really like that it is light and works as good as a full sized vacuum.
5,Handy Little Tool,"This does what it promises to do. Has good suction. I use it to vacuum the tile in the bathroom under the cabinet edges, behind the toilet, etc.Worth the price."
4,my new featherweight,"I bought 2 of these, one as a gift and the other for myself. It has goodsuction and does a great quick job. The only drawback is the cord is tooshort."
5,Great insight in a small package,Jane Straus has helped many people in the SF Bay Area. It's great to see her philosophy imparted to a larger audience. Read this book !
5,Let Your Sunshine Through,"""Most of the shadows of life are caused by standing in our own sunshine"" -- Ralph Waldo Emerson. This book shows how to let our sunshine through by getting past our shadowy defenses and living the life we really want. Clearly written and full of stories from her own life and the lives of people she has coached, in ""Enough Is Enough,"" Jane Straus provides the guidance and inspiration we each need."
5,Defragging the soul,"Through the port hole of her life experience, humbly and vulnerably, Jane shows great discernment in revealing the principles and laws that are in place in our world. Written in a tangible and practical way for immediate life changing application, this book will be a blessing to all who seek and value the fruit of wisdom. From the context of my Christian faith it does not contradict truths, but represents them in a way that all can benefit from regardless of background or religious belief. A great work! Thank you."
2,Not as useful as her podcasts,"I got interested in buying the book after listening to her ""Dear Jane"" podcasts. Unfortunately, the book was much less useful than her casts would lead you to believe. The podcasts are more useful than the book, and FREE!Look for David Burns and his 10 Days to Self Esteem book sets for some real help. There is also Break the Chains of Low Self Esteem (cannot remember author's name). These books have been immensely more helpful in dealing with my depression and related low self esteem.I don't even think I'd recommend Enough is Enough for anyone who is further along in her/his recovery process. Just not helpful. Lots of platitudes, but no real skill building exercises.Best of luck in whatever you choose on your road to recovery!"
3,Cools well but noisy,"Great in what the company says it does, but be prepared for the noise. Most of the noise appears to be produced by the fan which blows very strongly. Inexplicably, it seems there are only two fan settings: stronger and strongest. Engineering to avoid noise producing turbulent flow may also help. The grills of my two units also do not turn down due to poor fitting, either a design flaw or a production error.On the other hand, customer service is great! The vinyl window kits did not fit my narrow windows, and they quickly sent me the foam ones for free."
4,Nice story and a fun sequel,I ordered this as well as the first installment after having this movie on my DVR for months. My daughter loves the story and has fun with watching Merleah facing the challenges. Very CGI but entertaining and better than some of the earlier movies.
5,Great,"This is better than the first Barbie Mermaid Tale, which was really good! Daughter loved it. Mom loved it. Dad said ""most"" of the surfing is realistic! Great story line with lots of action and beautiful animation."
5,A great movie,"My daughters both love this movie. It has kept their attention over and over again. Sometimes the sequels are hokey, but this one is very well done and carries a good message."
4,barbie,I loved the movie.was happy that thay brought kelly sheriden to voice barbie.This is the first movie i brought since they changed her voice.I was mainly happy to hear kelly again
5,Fun sequel,Fun movie. We defiantly enjoyed it! worth purchasing if you like a mermaid tale! It followed right along where in sequence with the first. And it's not annoying to watch or listen too a couple of times in a row!
5,Gr daughter gift (9),"She jumped for joy! Had seen it before, was on her list for Christmas...She already had the first Mermaid Tale."
3,Way Too Expensive!,"This movie is okay. It is a surfer Barbie movie, exactly what you would expect. I am still shocked at the double digit price of it. Nothing about this movie is outstanding."
3,Songs not as good as in first Mermaid Tale,"Also, I found out they were showing this movie on Nick!!! So I DVR'd it and sent the movie back!! The songs on all her other Barbie DVDs are great; this one - not so much. In fact, my granddaughter has not asked to see this one again, and she usually watches her Barbie movies over and over."
3,"Wow. That was, um, ...","Well, for one thing, it was beautifully put together. The sets came across as thoroughly convincing - they gave everything needed for suspension of disbelief. The claymation puppets, too, are some of the most expressive I've seen, among those that stay somewhat close to reality. (I found the skin tones unsettling, though, about like what I enjoy least in some ofEgon Schiele'swatercolors.)The plot? Well, it wandered: the lonely old guy who'd chat up a telemarketer just to hear a human voice, the earnest little boy, the repo man, and (of course) the angel. The interactions all stay way in the low-key range - action lovers won't find much here, except maybe the wry humor at someone being a repeat offender at successful suicide.I don't have any easy words for this flick. When the mood strikes, though, I'm sure I'll come back to it again.-- wiredweird"
3,Some books not suitable for Kindle,I find the book interesting. However I regret not buying a print version as charts and diagrams do not translate well and are not views on kindle as they should be.As far as the book's content I found myself impatient wading through all the history of metabolic typing and wanting to get to the self assessment. Kindle does not makie going back and forth for content very easy.
1,Bad,"According to this book I'm a protein type but while it's true that I can be only for a limited time on a vegan or raw diet without being ill, following his advices I was ill, my skin was bad, I was always tired, I gained weight and my cholesterol and tryglicerides skyrocked, going back to a Mediterranean balanced diet made me lose that weight, eliminated in a few days the fatigue, my skin is perfect and everything is normal. This is bogus for me."
4,a MUST read for anyone interested in nutrition....,"Absolutely life changing. As I learn more about nutrition, I find I need to learn even more. And this book helped me to understand how little it really takes to improve my overall well being. I was NOT reading it to lose weight, but as an added by product, I shed a few pounds and found a mental clarity (particularly in the afternoons) that I never knew before. I am now in the process of ""living"" this diet, and I absolutely can't believe the difference in how I physically feel. The one problem I have with it is that there is no way to identify the type and diet for children. You need to know how different food types make you feel physically and mentally, and children can't possibly understand it."
2,Calories Don't Count ?,"I eagerly bought Walcotts book based on the title and concept and I now believe its true, ""you can't judge a book by its cover"".The content was amazingly VOID OF THE BASIC LAWS OF NUTRITION. Theories abound in the nutrition field and this is another I would recommend you stay away from. CALORIES DO COUNT! No matter what food combinations you eat, if you eat to much you will get fat! There is no getting around this basic fact.I give the book 2 stars because of effort only, its alot of work to put together such a detailed theory.Try Larry Norths diet program if you want to be thin."
2,MISSES THE MARK,"As a fitness enthusiast for 20 years I devour every book I can. This book was ok at best. Since I've never met Walcott or Fahey I don't know their motivation. When I read Andrew Weil I understand where he is coming from, not because I know him personally but because he makes his motivation obvious through his many excellent books. Please remember that sound nutrition is the basis of good health. The Metabolic Diet is a poor excuse for quality nutritional information. Its redeeming quality is the food choices are better than the typical American diet."
2,Lacking Kowledge of Basic Nutrition,"Interesting concept-- but author lacks any nutritional credentials or the basic concepts of how food works in the body. Calories do matter! Ratios of fat, protein and carbs are not magic and offer no protection from obesity. If you want to weigh less, reduce calories and exercise. Its that simple! Richard Simmons can help more than this book, at least he is fun!"
3,What's your type?,I like the book it seems like an easy read...but there in lies the problem. It so simple it feels like something is missing. Maybethe author made it this way for universality. If you are a fitness and nutrition nut it's worth investigation. The whole cyclic manipulation of macronutrients is very intriguing and could be a missing link. The bottom line is you have to experiment.
4,Good Read,The Metabolic Typing Diet is a good tool in figuring out what your metabolic type is and how to eat appropriately.
1,Shaggy dog Stating of the obvious,"Briefly: I had higher expectations for this book , but maybe that's because I'm an complimentary medicine therapist. There was a lot of decision making to do which I expected to lead to some revelatory conclusions. It didn't - it lead to the obvious. Nothing new here."
2,Just Another Diet Book,There were only about 100 pages of this book that were worth reading and then I discovered that everyone I gave the test to came up the same (Mixed-meaning balance of Protein and Carbs each day). Based on what I see the book is just promoting a health diet since everyone came up with the balanced diet and not either all protein or all carb. I was really disappointed by this book.
1,TRIED IT DIDN'T LIKE IT,I was ready for something new so I bought this book.After 90 days I haven't lost a single pound and feel no different than before.It seems that the author misses the mark with his claims that this is the missing link to weightloss and good health.
1,a waste of money,"the book tells you everyone is differentso you may have to eat differentlyhalf of the book is made of the test, you will get a poorly set test , with no reason given to why and how your type is decided . just that for so and so points you fall into so and so group .after the test you will realise that (99% of us) you will need equal amount of carb and protein-A balance diet.Forget about the book, in my opinionavoid hydrogenated oil, reduce intake of refined sugar, dextrose , salt and artifical flavorings. don't use fouride toothpaste, watch less TV and internet, do exercise twice a week an hour each. listen to slow music and read a biography or auto-biography of a famous person once every few months. And you will be fine."
1,So-So book.,"There are much better books on this same topic. This book seems to be written over the head of many instead of in a conversational tone. Don't get me wrong, the topic is a GREAT one... it's just that I think it would have much more credibility coming from someone knowledgable on the subject rather than a former encarcerated dentist. I highly recommend the topic, I just don't recommend this book. Spend your money elsewhere."
5,A must have for reaching optimum health,As a student of a Natural Health College it is not often I read a book that has more influence than my course text books. Here is an example of one of those books that actually exceeded my expectations. I have also personelly applied much of what is contained within this book with great success. It is a must have.
3,Just OK,"Although the information contained is good, the test that is used to accurately assess someone's metabolic type is incomplete. I had to go online and search many MANY databases to get the complete test. If I wrote this book, I would have included the complete test, duh!"
5,An important contribution,"THE AUTHORS HAVE CLEARLY EXPRESSED A UINFIED THEORY OF BIOLOGICAL INDIVIDUALITY AND HAVE SYNTHESIZED A PRACTICLE AND, TO MY KNOWLEDGE, UNIQUELY COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO APPLYING THIS MOST FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE TO WELLNESS. I KNOW THAT THEIR PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE, ITS LOGICAL, ITS SIMPLE AND IT IS TOO IMPORTANT TO OVERLOOK. ANYONE INTERESTED IN FINE TUNING THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH PROGRAM, OR WHO IS A PROFESSIONAL IN THE FIELD, WILL FIND THIS BOOK INFORMATIVE, STRAIGHT FORWARD, AND IMMENSELY VALUABLE."
2,Metabolic typing diet,It was OK....lots of info in a mixed complicated way....not specificenough to really determine your type.
4,The Metabolic Typing Diet,The book was very helpful in finding out my metabolic type and it will help me in my selection of food for better health.
4,Excellent Tool for Customizing Individual Diets,"Those who have progressed through the ""zone,"" eating ""right 4 your type,"" and going ""Paleo,"" will find this book to be a useful tool to round out and fine tune their dietary choices. A number of perspectives are covered. The self-administered survey is useful and informative. I feel enriched for having access to the information that has contributed to the success of my current regimen of eating Paleo. As with any additional book, there is a temptation to abandon elements of the diet that are working based on the additional information. I recommend the book to identify additional steps only while maintaining whatever has led to previous success. We are all individual and there is no one-size-fits-all diet. The additional information in this book has been helpful to me."
1,DON'T BUY THE KINDLE VERSION!!!,"The Kindle version of this book is missing content in the questionnaire to determine your metabolic type. It is impossible to determine your type with 16 of the questions unanswerable. It would seem that the questions that appear first on the hard copy page are the culprits. In the some cases, the question is not complete and in most, the answer choices are missing. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! It also appears that Amazon does not let you return digital content, even if it is useless."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read on Nutrition,"After 8 years of reading health books, I've finally found the one that beats them all. This is a novel approach, a real paradigm shift. I'm very grateful to the author for cutting through all the confusion surrounding nutrition. It clearly explains why focusing on a patient's specific needs has to be the foundation of health care."
4,Metabolic Typing Diet a Must For Health,"The Metabolic Typing Diet is a must read for anyone seeking optimum health. In fact, if you're plagued by vague symptoms of any kind, this is a doubly must read.Simply put, this book's message is that we all don't thrive on the same kind of diet. Some people (like me) do better on a high protein diet, while others do better on a higher carbohydrate diet.The author goes into great detail about why this is so, and backs up his assertions with considerable scientific evidence and studies.So how do you tell what kind of diet is right for you? Well, there's a self test within the book, comprised of about 50 questions or so. After taking this test, you'll have a pretty good idea what your ideal metabolic type is, and you can design your diet accordingly.Bottom line: This book is highly recommended."
3,I know my type but not what to eat.,"I thought the idea of this book was great. It provides good justification on why people need to eat differently. It presents a good starting point to determine what type you are in metabolically . The book fell apart for me in the follow through. I have no better understanding of exactly what I should be eating. I do know that I should not be eating chocolate, caffeine and alcohol, along with certain other foods, that we have been told years ago are bad for us. Overall, I think this book needs to be re-written to more current understandings of food. I think that the book needs to provide more exact information on what each type should eat so it would actually be useful."
4,Just Ok!,Really nothing special about this plate. It serves it's purpose and arrived in a timely manner. No complaints!
3,OK,"It is ok. More about over obsession more than griving the loss of love. A little dissapointed, but very good for almost sick obsessions over someone."
4,trying to help a friend,"Good book but i think many obsessive love relationships are born from being in a relationship with a committment phobic - a person who sends mixed messages and who seems to leave the door open in small ways, giving false hope, taking the special things they said and did away, one small piece at a time until the other is starved for crumbs. If someone finds themselves with a commitment phobic, buying the book He's Scared, She's Scared, is a must, imo."
5,Hits you right in the face with the reasons behind this behavior,Well written for the layman. Helps you understand the possible reasons behind the madness and how to return to more acceptable ways to deal with the loss of toxic love and acceptance of real love.
1,Not about love addiction,"I bought this book because it sounded like it was about love addiction, unfortunately it isn't. The first half of the book was filled with stories about the unfortunate victims of stalker behavior. I'm not sure what the second half of the book contained (as I didn't read it). If you're interested in reading about the dynamics of love addiction and ways of working through the disease I would suggest, instead,Facing Love Addictionby Pia Mellody orHow to Break Your Addiction to a Personby Howard Halpern."
3,Useful information...,"The book was easy to read and simple to understand. I would consider it to be a good book for beginners (as an introduction to obsessive love), but I would probably supplement it with other reading material.I bought the book because I was the target of an obsessive lover and I wanted to understand his behavior and the root of obsessive love a bit more. I ended up learning a bit about him and myself after reading this book. I related a lot to Karen's story...she and I are what the author calls ""co-obsessive lovers..."" we have some obsessive tendencies of our own (also our indecisiveness and weak characters contribute to their obsessiveness). Anyhow, I am no longer with my partner, but after reading the book I was motivated to seek help so that I don't make the same mistake in the future."
4,Great place to start,"This book is a great place to start if you believe you or someone you love may be addicted to relationships. I also highly recommend ""Confusing Love With Obsession: When You Can't Stop Controlling Your Partner and the Relationship."""
3,Recomendable,"Hace un par de meses compre esta version (NVI) de Audio Biblia en lugar de la Version Reina Valera que es la que uso para lectura con la finalidad de escucharla facilmente en un año y a la vez compararla contra la RV para un mejor entendimiento de la Biblia. La AudioBiblia cumple con lo minimo necesario, la voz del narrador si es entendible pero va un poco rapido. La califique con 3 estrellas porque la voz tiende a ser monotona si escuchas muchos capitulos en un dia, mas sin embargo para mi cumple con lo que esperaba ya que para el plan de lectura anual que estoy siguiendo normalmente escucho 3 capitulos diarios (~15 minutos). Ademas de esto, algo que me parecio muy bueno es que incluyeron al inicio de cada libro de la Biblia una explicacion breve del mismo, lo que hace mas facil su estudio."
2,Simple,"Aunque la portada dice totalmente orquestado, realmente no tiene música ni sonidos. Es solamente la voz del narrador. Sinceramente me pareció monótono."
1,FATAL!!!,"Escucho muchos audiolibros, nunca había escuchado un narrador tan malo!!! Me da dolor de cabeza escucharlo, las narrativas emocionantes de la biblia se vuelven un receta de cocina con este narrador.NO PUEDO COMPRENDER COMO ZONDERVAN CONTRATÓ A SEMEJANTE NARRADOR, pareciera que se preocuparon solo por una buena pronunciación de las palabras sin poner el menor cuidado en los tonos y la narración.Gran desilusión!"
2,NVI Audio Biblia,"The reading of the historical books of the OT up through Esther was good. However, as of the poetical books and the prophets, the reader changed the tone of his inflections at the end of nearly sentence with at upward tone. This I found extremely annoying. It ruined the whole last half of the Old Testament. I could not stand to listen to it. This was very disappointing. I do not recommend this product, unless you want to discard half the OT.La lectura de los libros históricos hasta Ester es adecuada. Sin embargo, a partir de los libros poeticos, incluyendo todos los profetas, el lector cambió el tono de sus inflecciones al final de cada frase de forma que suena muy desagradable e irritante. Quedó para mi arruinada la mitad trasera entera del Antiguo Testamento. No recomiendo esta obra, excepto que se contenta de desechar la mitad del Antiguo Testamento."
1,nv audio biblia(spanish version),cd did not work. they work for little then they do not work. bed buy and i can not rich not one to return the product.
1,The Ultimate Pseudoscience,"Having read this and another book (Quantum Psychology) by this author, I can vouch for a complete lack of logic or reason within the pages of this book. Moreover, of all the authors I have ever read, this one seems the biggest kook of all. If your into unfounded, if not outright ludicrous, scientific conclusions reached through mystic-minded, drug-induced idiocy (as in the idea the human race was seeded by aliens or dancing little green men) in a form lacking utterly in any manner of logical order, then this is the literature for you. Frankly, this guy's so far out in left field he can't see home plate. There's a word for people who create their own reality in this manner: nuts. Save your money. Better yet, spend it on Carl Sagan's ""The Demon-Haunted World"" for some really intelligent reading. Personally, I'm actually ashamed to admit I read Wilson's books. I only did so at the bequest of a friend whose grounding in reality I am now surely questioning."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Robert Anton Wilson is a very strange man. Here he writes about allsorts of things, conspiracies, magic, the occult, weird happenings andhow lots of things like this tie together and are meaningful. The otherfunny thing is the whole numerology bit, where the number twenty-threeis seen as being very important, and turns up in all sorts of places."
5,This book changed my life!,"An ex-girlfriend once told me, ""Don't ever let a book change your life."" Soon thereafter I bought Cosmic Trigger and failed to heed her advice... thank goddess! It's an excellent mind-opener"
5,Reality tunnel changer,"After reading this book, I tuned in another reality tunnel (you'll understand what I meant after reading the book).What can I say, I recommend this book to ultimate freedom seekers and the ones(probably the same people) that enjoyed Carlos Castaneda series( especially Journey to Ixtlan).Great writing, great man, great insight. I'd have to write a book just as a review for this one so I'll stop here :-)"
5,Perfect!,"My husband gave me this ring first as a promise ring while we were dating, and I loved it so much that it has continued on as my engagement ring and now wedding ring. It is absolutely beautiful and a fantastic deal for the price! We had looked long and hard for a ring with my birthstone and it is just too perfect for me to part with it. The stones are larger than I expected and as long as you clean the stones occasionally (I rarely do) the blue is absolutely stunning. If we had to, we would make the purchase all over again and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Not Helpful,"A mom who lost her Bipolar son to suicide wrote this book based on her personal experience. It definately does not do what the subtitle says it does--give parents and professionals everything they need to know! I found that a new book, ""If Your Child is Bipolar"" gives great information on what parents need to do to take care of their Bipolar child and does a much, much better job. ""The Bipolar Child"" should also be on the bookshelf of every parent with a child who is or might be Bipolar."
3,"Interesting, but very personal","While this book addresses many important topics related to childhood-onset Bipolar Disorder, it is also very closely tied to the author's personal experience of losing a child to the disorder. It provides one parent's perspective on medical treatment and suicide. It's can be a helpful resource, but could also be somewhat depressing for parents looking for solutions to their daily challenges.--Sheryl Gurrentz, co-author of ""If Your Child is Bipolar--a parent to parent guide to living with and loving a Bipolar child"""
5,"quick, reliable, and good products too","I am very pleased with this providers attention to speed, quality of product, price, and service."
3,Tres Funky,"Tribal Jam est un trio de chanteurs francais/africains. Leur musique est un melange marrant du funk, rap, et ce qu'on appelle en Amerique, rhythm and blues. L'album contient deux versions de ""Demarre le Show,"" leur tube la plus populaire. D'autres chansons que j'aime: ""Dis-Moi,"" ""Je Te Donne Mon Coeur,"" et ""Remind Me."" Pour tout ce qui s'interesse a ce genre de musique, il n'existe pas un meilleur exemple. Achetez cet album!"
5,**COMPLETE** track listing,Amazon's track list above is incomplete. Here is the complete track list: 1) Sign Of The Crab 2) Bob (Cousin O.) 3) Drinking Song 4) Spear & Magic Helmet 5) Last To Know 6) Guilt Within Your Head 7) Whirlwind 8) Another Shot Of Whiskey 9) Second Skin 10) Activity Grrrl 11) You Got A Problem 12) Crimson & Clover 13) Drunks
1,Insulting money ploy,"It's Gits karaoke fronted by the equivalent of Pat Benatar.Joan Jett's a punk rock icon? Um, no. She peddled the same '80s radio hard rock as any of those other losers, no matter how ""punk"" Rolling Stone and middle aged New Wave fans have recontextualized The Runaways as.Viva Zapata."
4,A Roaring Good Prequel!,"I found this book to be a very entertaining read! Most movie tie-in books are lame in my opinion. This book has all of the familiar characters from the movie and describes their actions leading up to where the movie begins. A good plot, plenty of action, a visit to Skull Island, and just a hint of Kong himself make this an enjoyable prequel to the movie! Kong Lives!"
4,In the beginning,Have you seen King Kong at the cinemas or on DVD and wanted certain questions answered; Primarily how Carl Denham obtained the map that showed skull island and about the man that grabbed the map. Well if you want answers to these questions then this is the book for you.It gives living accounts of characters that appear in the movie of where they were before they all met. Even Kong makes a special appearance; however he is not the main focus of the story.This is not a story that revolves around Kong. This is most probably the reason why many people would stop reading; however many might want answers to the questions that I did and not be able to put it down.
5,Excellent Book,If you know someone who has suffered the pain of a divorce then you should know that there is a great deal of inspirational thought in this book and you should not hesitate to offer as a gift of compassion for them. Jim Smoke is wonderful in his writings and experience!
1,Missing Information / Incorrect Information,"I own a 96 Trans AM w/ the RAM air option. I purchased this book to help me troubleshoot some electrical and engine problems. Unfortunately much of the information did not match the build of my car, especially information pertaining to wiring. After 8 individual instances of incorrect information I was hesitant to use the book further. I can't speak for other models, but if you own a 96 TA with Ram Air stay away from this book."
5,Inspirational and specific language to explain concepts,Wonderfully specific for every level of employee within a company. Definitely a great handbook of 'expectations' to share with staff and family/friends. Bilingual English/Spanish make it perfect for the Latin American or multi national companies of small side looking for a training outline.
1,Portuguese Edition is NOT in Portuguese! FALSE Advertising,"Amazon advertises this book as the PORTUGUESE EDITION, which I'd love to buy, but the one on display is in SPANISH and half the customer reviews are in Spanish, suggesting that some idiot at Amazon can't tell the difference between the two languages."
1,WRONG PRESENTATION OF PRODUCT,"I have found this book after searching for Portuguese books. In reality the book is in Spanish, and contradictorily rated in its page as:#19 in Books > Libros en español > Negocios e inversiones > Mundo del NegocioBUT ALSO as:#48 in Books > Nonfiction > Foreign Language Nonfiction > PortugueseThese kind of errors obliges a costumer to check and check again to luckilly (if ever) find the correct version in the correct language at the correct price in the correct place. It also obliges to spend stupid, wastefull time, using the search option.Since these errors are so easily avoidable when products are entered in the database it is regretfull that one cannot trust Amazon, which sometimes seems to lack some respect for costumers, even if this is of course not intended. :-("
1,Please don't buy this!,"My title alone must be self-explanatory. Neither Pires nor Abbado seem to be able to bring to the foreground the remarkable subtlety of Mozart's language. This becomes increasing apparent in the modulations (slow mvmt.from #17, the development in the first mvmt. of #21 or the give-and-take between the soloist and the woodwinds in the last mvmt. of the same), or in their tones. It is brittle and lacking in warmth, sensitivity or feeling. The tempi are uneven, at times too fast, and while Pires may be outgoing, but these are 2 masterpieces for more reasons than that alone. I would personally favor Perahia's recording of #17, and for #21, either Brendel with Sir Neville Marriner (except for Radu Lupu's cadenza to the first mvmt.) or preferably, Kovecevich with Sir Colin Davis and the London Symphony. Unfortunately, the latter is now only available in the UK. As far as the Pires/Abbado recording is concerned, I consigned it to the garbage."
5,My Favorite,"I love the color rendition right across the whole spectrum from the blue range, all the way to the reds. It also has excellent exposure latitude; as I have used it on my one shutter speed/one aperture Holga 120S. Try this film in your Hasselblad or your old Rollei, and you'll be amazed at the overall quality of this film.Fuji Provia 100F also has a long shelf life. I've used it a year past its expiration date with no color shifts and no fogging, but you should store it away from extreme heat (like inside a car in full sun) and preferably in a metal cookie tin to shield the film from some (not all) radiation. For long-term storage, it keeps nicely in the freezer."
3,Only good if your child is under 1 year old,"This is a good book for first time moms only if you read this book during the first year. My son was 1 when I purchased this book, it did not tell my anything I didn't already know."
1,Way too preachy and religious,"The book presents itself as a practical guide to doing something everyday to benefit your new baby. However, most of the recommendations involve praying. This book is NOT how what it sounds like. I made the mistake of buying it - don't make the same one."
5,Just what I needed,"I only wish I'd purchased this book before my daughter was born. I'll certainly give it as gifts to expecting moms because it has been a daily nourishment to my soul. Wonderful quick tips, insights, and devotionals. Just what a new mom needs."
5,A new mothers guide,This is a must for every new mother to use over and over again. It is very practical and answers many thing about your very own baby.
4,Great book!,This was a really nice book. A friend gave a copy to me and I liked it so much I bought a copy for someone else.
4,Track Rac tiedowns do the job quite well.,The Trac Rac system is a nice system and the tiedowns do their job quite well. I advise some method of locking them in place or remove them when you know you won't need them for a few days. They are a fairly easy and high theft item. They did not come directly from Amazon and the dealer in Florida sent the wrong items and caused a 3 week delay. Use caution when buying stuff that does not come directly from Amazon.
4,The stuff legends are made of,"Before Simon And Garfunkel. These are recordings that Paul and Art had cut on their own.Track after rare track of the beginnings of true legends. The sound is amazing! Boy , am I glad I snatched this up when it first came out, as it is the best pre-S & G available."
4,Greatest Hits Again??,"Selena will always remain the best selling Latin artist and I am a huge fan of hers...but you can only release so many greatest hits....The only reason I purchased this cd is for Puede Ser...That song is amazing....But In the past the family has released...All My Hits,All My Hits 2,Ones,and also they have Unforgettable,Unforgettable The Studio Album,and Ultimate Edition....You can only release so many Greatest Hits....But Selena is a great artist"
4,"An eerie, original novel","Once again, that poet of despair Samuel Beckett puts the reader through purgatory--or, in this case, an endless tract of mud, which our narrator muddles through for about 150 pages. Written entirely without punctuation, and sometimes a little obscure as to exactly what is going on, this book does not make for easy reading. It's worth the effort, though.I almost didn't get through it myself. ""Post-modern hocus-pocus,"" I thought sourly, as I read the first third. But it becomes oddly compelling, even poetic. Beckett's severely minimalistic style is fascinating; there's nothing in this book except the eerily dehumanized voice of its narrator, a lonely monologue that generates real poignancy. The effect is like hearing a voice from beyond the grave, and it haunts the mind like few conventionally written novels do."
1,Garbage In -> Garbage Out,"How does an abhorrent piece of study material like this even make it past the editors? I know that if I was an editor, I would NOT want my name associated with this book. Just go to the Cisco Press website and take a look at the 42kb errata file. There is a correction on almost every other page it seems! Please, save your money and your time and look elsewhere for study material. This book will more than likely cause you to fail the test rather than pass."
2,Incomplete; not sufficient material to pass 640-821,"I should have read the reviews on this book before taking the exam...I missed it by 5 points, 785/790. That's less than 1 question."
2,Geek Speak,"The writing style is so lousy and unreadable, I shifted to the other CCNP BCRAN book (...)midway. Better as a finishing touch rather than as a starting point."
1,Didn't work,It came OK and the thermostat light lit up but my pipes still frooze. I'm overseas and don't have postal return.
1,Returning Product -- it is Defective,Installed -- not working properly. Going to return. To be fair I purchased similar product that is working as it should.
3,Doesn't get very warm,"This is the second pipe heating cable I've owned. My first one, another brand, would get nice and toasty on the water pipes outdoors when it got below freezing temps. This one though, never feels warm to the touch, even when temps get down in the low 20's. The light comes on which should indicate that it's working, but it sure doesn't feel like it, since I can feel no warmth like I could with my first cable. Guess I'll have to wait and see if my pipes freeze or not before I'll know if it's doing anything."
5,M-D Building Products Heating Cable Review,"This product was ordered through Amazon along with the fiberglass insulation that goes with the unit. This item was received on time. I'm pleased with the unit & the ease of installation & use. Once the unit is complete, it is permanently installed with no worry of frozen pipes. This unit is recommended along with the fiberglass insulation that goes with the unit."
4,heating cable,works good.helped me out. after sandy had to use heating cable and a generator to keep water pipe from buristing.
4,Check out her website b4 gnashing your teeth.,"I do not want to put any spoiler in this post, but I was obsessing about the ending, as many of you have, so I went to the horse's mouth. What CDT had to say actually brought tears to my eyes. I urge any dissatisfied readers to go to her site."
1,wimpy,"The first book was wonderful. The second was good; not great, but good. The third was just so much wimpy mush. The main character, Ash, was great in the first book because she was strong and smart. She saw the flaws in others and was very perceptive. She was kind and gentle without being a fainting doormat. In the second book she is still pursuing her goal in a non ""oh, my goodness"" manner and the history of why she is the way she is, is great and takes up a 1/3 of the book. She is naive and innocent, but still an interesting character. In the third book where she gets her memories back, it seems like she looses her spine and her smarts. She seems to relie way too much on a man saving her. Granted, it is a middle-ages setting, but still, after all she has been through, she should be tougher, not weaker. The prithees and thous do bug after awhile, the author could have done less or not at all. Over all the book is worth skimming over to see how the trilogy is tied up but not worth buying."
1,Skipped most of it,"This lady has a writing knack, no doubt about it. She can create a world really well. Some of her ideas are quirky, unique and downright fascinating. And the way she has taken the old fairy tales of the UK and transformed them into a story reveals considerable research.Yet the characters failed to engage me. There was so much distance between me and the characters that I found it impossible to have any loyalties towards any of them. Far too many prithees and dost thous for my liking.There were also far too many instances where the story would just stop and CDT would describe a flower or a tree or some other such thing, as though these sidetracks added to the story. If you deleted all the unnecessary descriptions, you might reduce the size of the trilogy by 10-20%.And the ending was infuriating, as though CDT had run out of puff and ideas.Not worth the purchase price."
2,Agggh terrible ending,The key thing about this book is that I could have binned the book when I read the ending!!! CDT - you might be advised to do an updated edition.TOTALLY unsatisfying ending that finishes all in a rush and lack of steam. The book has lots and lots of beautifully written descriptions (and yes I did skip pages and pages of it) but what is the good of all that great world building if we skimp on plot and character. The protagonist starts out interesting in ill made mute but gets more and more Mary Sue as the series progresses.
2,Want an SAT vocab book? Try this one,"The story line hooked me in the first two books, but this one drags on in long, windy descriptions of landscapes and obscure words that make the protagonist sound like she's carrying a thesaurus around. What kind of author writes ""osmosis seeped"" as a full sentence? Besides the millions of words you could only find on an SAT test, the characters fade in and out of talking like Yoda and using lofty words that are out of place. Intriguing story, but poorly written."
2,"The series started so well, too bad....","that it ended so poorly. I hope that Cecilia learns how to end books better for her next series as I really really liked the first two book. Ironic that I bought the third in hard-cover to find it the weakest in terms of plot and character development. I certainly recommend the first two, then make up a conclusion in your own mind."
1,A horrible ending,"There was promise in the first book, but I have to say not as much as is claimed by some here. The second dragged, and this one was terrible. And the ending was absolutely offensive. I would recommend Charles de Lint, Juliet Marillier or Elizabeth Haydon if you are looking for a lovely touch of Celtic writing, and skip this trilogy all together."
2,Crushed by the denouement,"As with the previous books, the prose was well-written. I couldn't put the book down because of the plot twists and turns. However, the ending was totally inappropriate. CDT was probably feeling guilty because she tried to rescue her trilogy with an EPILOGUE!!! Her editors should have screamed at her. If you want to read well-written tragedies that have a love story, pick Elizabeth Haydon, Jacqueline Carey, or Robin Hobb."
1,Forget it,"Although the first book was great and the second one was OK, the 3rd book was almost a complete waste of time. Things just seemed to happen without any coherence. My recommendation.. Do not buy this book!! However, if you are like me and have invested time and money into the first two books you will read it anyway."
4,It really IS a fairy tale,"I often enjoy fantasy books with meandering plots because the world in which I wander is pleasing. In the same fashion, I also take pleasure in 'over-writing' where the author uses far more adjectives and adverbs than considered acceptable by modern-day writing pundits.So, I enjoyed the Battle of Evernight, though I agree it is not the best of the Bitterbynde trilogy.I don't quite understand though why so many other readers are outraged by its ending. It is clear, especially in this last book, how much this trilogy is modelled on the traditional fairy tale. Its morality, the chastity of its main characters, the ambiguity of good and evil, are all typical. And the penultimate end is also familiar - the end many feel so let down by. It is a magical, a wave-of-the-wand-and-everything-comes-out-right ending.Just right for a fairy tale, even such a long one as this. It was unexpected, and I rather liked it."
2,Bitterblunder,"I loved the first two books in this series and being somewhat of a soppy romantic I had fallen in love with the unErithly beauty of ""Thorn"". I finished reading 'The Battle of Evernight' about an hour ago and I am still reeling from the putrid, pathetic ending. The ending is so unsatisfying and utterly hateful that I wish I had never starting reading the series. I have given it two stars in memory of my love of the first two books. Don't bother with it folks. Read Lord of the Rings again instead."
3,Disappointed,"Following the 'Ill made mute', which I found to be in a class with Tolkien. 'The Lady of the Sorrows', lacked the detail of the previous book the story line was somehow lacking, but the last""the Battle of Evernight"" was very disappointing I was looking for more, perhaps a fourth book is in the offering."
2,Beginners need not apply!,"I am a pharmacy student, and this is a very thorough text book, but as a study guide I have found that it is mainly boring and useless. Anyone other than a medical student probably should find a better text book."
1,The only disappointing Weis & Hickman book I've ever read,"I am an avid Weis & Hickman fan starting with Dragonlance Chronicles. I have read every piece of their work I have been able to find. This is the first series I have found trully boring. Unreadable would be a bit extreme but not far off. You've heard people say a thousand times ""I couldn't put it down"" this is the only time I've said ""I couldn't pick it up"" to any of their books."
4,Amazing,"Have you ever heard of an arabian style fantasy? Ever wondered how a fantasy like that could ever take place? A fantasy where there are immortals, who are divided among the many gods. Every god chosing his way of dealing with his followers. One being a father like figure, one being the all impotant god, etc.This Book is an introduction to the nomad people who follow the wanderer god akhran. When a war in heaven is forces itself upon man kind only the wanderer god stands in the between.This first book tells the story of how 2 rival tribes following Akhran come together in their god's wishes. This was a fantastic read and i finished the 3 part trilogy in a week. Anyone loving fantasy will be sucked in to thin world that has a little of everything. Get it!!!"
4,great easy reading.,"This series is really well written. It pulls you in, yells at you and than slowly throws you to the desert :) ... a must read in my book collection."
5,cosmic etherial comic opera,"Here, in the best recording ever issued of the work, is Strauss's bubbly profound masterpiece that's suffused with compassion for the foibles of love and old age. It is almost as great as the two greatest operas ever written, Intermezzo, and Capriccio, both of which happen to be Strauss in a similar vein but without the geriatric emphasis. Along with the monumentally cosmic Elektra, they represent the pinnacle of the operatic art, which the modest Strauss (who looked up to both Mozart and Wagner) nonetheless felt especially proud to have penned. Although the Bohm is the best performance by virtue of its maintaining best the momentum and communicating most fully the work's profundity, the performance conducted by Janowski captures a bit better the comic-opera qualities, and the performance conducted by Sawallisch is a fine compromise between both approaches. All three versions are excellent, but the Bohm wears the best upon repeated hearings and therefore gets my nod."
3,Holdsworth...the great,"This is an O.K CD.....I'd recommend that you start with something else if you are new to Holdsworth. Don't pay the ASKING PRICES HERE $70 U.S...YOU HAVE GOT TO BE JOKING...THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE RIPOFF!!! Stuff like this makes me sick...people making profit at the artists expense...Don't give them the satisfaction!!! Allan Holdsworth is a genius , but this is far from his best CD."
4,Book Description,"If you are searching for a guide in reference to Golden Oak Furniture, this book supplies it all. It is filled with wonderful color pictures and a large assortment of furniture types. This book has been a time saver for me."
5,Best Book on Zen that I ever Read,"I have read about fifteen books on Zen. This one book helped me more than any other book on Zen. The big advantage of this book is the author's own realization of Satori, combined with his excellent understanding of English. Whatever may have been lost in the translation of the original Buddhist scriptures has been restored by this author. This is the only author that has both a deep realization, and an excellent command of the English language."
4,A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT BUT STILL READABLE!,"Ethan Hardeman seems to value innocence in so far as he doesn't go all the way?? But it sure doesn't stop him from wanting to see Arabella unclothed.Disappointed as the story seems to revolve around an introduction to sex in their byplay or was it supposed to be foreplay?Story was possible I guess, given the characters seemingly confused states of mind. Arabella was too dumb and too willing!and what happened soon became apparent that it was his own fault.Still it had readable interest even the second time around even after 7 years. Have read better.As a bonus we were allowed to find out how many children the Ballenger boys had as I am always interested in previous characters and their doings. [just as if they were real] Calhoun and Justin are still very much in love with their wives [thank god]!"
1,Unbelievably unrealistic.,"I found it difficult to understand that a modern and mature American man like Ethan could be so insecure as to believe himself impotent, especially as he's no virgin! When I found out he was a puritan, I thought that explained it, but he's not like any puritan I've heard of. I mean that his puritanism kicks in only when he wants to. I also found his 'teasing byplay' with his mother to be more appropriate with a sibling or lover. I mean, calling his mom 'shrimp' and deliberately picking fights with her is damn disrespectful. Ethan is also such an SOB because of the way he twice cruelly rejected Arabella, whom he supposedly loved more than anything in the world. (Ha!)"
5,Fashion Fever Velvet Crush Couch,Beautifully made couch with fabulous mod light fixtures and a fun screen for the background! Goes with the other mod FF furniture and is perfect for the vintage mod Barbie dolls!!!
3,If you are a race fan,"I enjoyed the book. However, I did find that the impressive coverage of Norton's illustrious racing history came at the expense of the technical and corporate history. Some may not find this a fault, but I was looking for more information on production models. And there simply wasn't enough mention of the twins with which us Yanks are most familiar (I can't afford a Manx but a Commando is a possibility...) If you are a fan of the singles that made Norton a great name in motorsports, you will like this book. It is well written and informative."
1,No Way!! Keep looking elsewhere...,"One thing is for certain: the engineering of the chorus is far too recessed in this Previn re-recording. That is NOT a minor issue to me. It also sounds fairly ""slack"" and uncommitted. Hardly jubilant where it needs to be. Nor did I find the recording that wide-ranging either. I didn't even care for the soloists who were largely uninspired as everything else. Junk! Better keep the earlier Previn, which was altogether a more sensual performance. But my nod goes to Levine, overall..."
1,Not the best mic by far,"Maybe i got a bad mic but I bought this mic for the purpose of modifying it. I did noticed the housing wasn't as sturdy as other mics i've owned (nady 1050). The writing on the mic were kinda just inked on, it was engraved on the housing.Before I did anything I recorded some vocals & notice the mic sounded thin & unimpressive. I continued to modify it by swapping the tube out for a better one. I notice it was still giving a thin sound. I then replaced the capsule & still no good.By the end of my modification I concluded that the mic was cheaply made & nothing short of replacing all the inner parts (transformers, wires etc...) would help this mic...I guess thats what you get for a mic under $200"
1,You get what you pay for,These things are awkward to handle and simply don't work well. Shell out the extra five bucks for some foam grips.
3,Okay but not really helpful,"These are so strong that to exercise becomes painful. If you are going to get hand grips for very weak hands, then find a pair with adjustable grips. I will keep them and eventually hope to use them."
2,Not comfortable,"The plastic hurts after five reps, buy foam, quality is good but size is kind of small, definetly reccomend foam"
3,Good but slippery,"I bought these with the intention of building up my hand strength. I work out 3-5 times a week, and consider of decent hand strength to begin with. I think these are pretty good in terms of providing a workout for your hands. Size is nice as well, as I often find them too small for my hands in stores. I do have a couple of points that keep them from being higher than 3 star:1) The material is not the least non-slip. Get sweaty hands and they're like trying to squeeze a fish, and slide all over your hands.2) The edges of the molded ""finger"" sides are rather uncomfortable. It's not very rounded, so they tend to make the skin on your fingers sore well before your hands feel well worked out.If you wrap them in a small hand towel, both issues are reduced, but looks ridiculous.Overall, for 6.50, they're not bad...just not that great."
2,"Crappy design, get a better one","I should have looked closer at the picture and noticed how skinny the grip handles were. The ones that I've used in the past had thicker and rounder handles so that the pressure was more evenly and ergonomically distributed. This one is skinny and pointy and hurts the hands when used a lot. I think I'm going to have to tear up an old tshirt and tie it around the handles to make it more usable. I was expecting one grip but it comes with 2 which is nice I guess. Overall, I'm disappointed with it but I should have known it was crap from the price. Anyhow, I'll make it usable with the tshirt trick but if you haven't bought it yet, get something else."
3,hand grip,it work preety efficent but the grip hurts the grip is not comfortable comfortable to use it hurt when i uses it but comes in 2
5,excellent reference,This well written and to the point. An excellent reference for anyone but especially someone who is getting started in boating. It is one of those that you will want to refer to again and again.
2,ENCYCKLO,"This is mildly interesting read, but is not exhaustive or deep enough to be a true reference book. Might make a nice gift."
4,Very Good,"This is a very nice selection of Weill pieces showing the full range of his output. These range from the ambitious Seven Deadly Sins to songs from Happy End to some of his Broadway work. All are very interesting. The performers, particularly Von Otter, are excellent. Recommended strongly."
4,Good documenting film,"Fuji film is usually a cooler color toned film than say Kodak(warm tone). I use Fuji's color slide film for documenting all my artwork and important subjects. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer film to pixels for documenting.I found a lab (Colormark)based in Phoenix, AZ that is friendly and do a good job developing slide film. They can probably ship your order to most anywhere in the US. I am sure there are other labs that process film, but this is just one that I have used and know the quality."
5,Messiaen's masterpiece that unites his spirit and technique,"Eclairs sur l'au-dela (Flashes from the distant beyond) was Messiaen's last orchestral piece. It uses exotic techniques such as bird song, Hindu raga rhythm, Gregorian chant, and modes of limited transposition in a large, multi-movement orchestral piece. The orchestra features an expanded percussion section. Those who know and love Messiaen's musc will greatly enjoy L'eclairs sur l'eau-dela. It convincingly integrates the diverse techniques into a final spiritual statement. Those who do not know Messiaen's music will find this piece to be a great introduction to a twentieth-century giant who assimilated Debussy and Schoenberg while writing in his unique compostional voice. The French performance lacks some of the weight and power that the New York Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta brought to this work at its premiere at Avery Fisher Hall. The interpretation is bright and crisp when needed and sensous in the more meditative moments."
3,Mediocre Messiaen,"I thought this CD would be worth a listen to after experiencing the Turangalila Symphony. However, compared to the great Messiaen works, such as the Turangalila or the Quartet for the End of Time, this work is quite mediocre, and not worth the price of the CD.In form the music alternates between serene moments and Messiaen's famous birdcall music. However, the more serene moments do not have the timeless quality that you can find in Mahler, Tavener, Part, etc. Unless you must listen to all of Messiaen's works, skip this one."
4,Garden Open Today,"If you are a gardener, a lover of ""village living,"" or a garden afficianado, this is the Perfect Book. Witty, knowledgeable and observant, Beverly Nichols entertains from page one to the end. I am only sad that his books seem to be out of print."
3,Red Rarity,"""Red Moon"" is interesting mostly for its subject and setting: The Soviet space program from the earliest manned flights until the race to the Moon was lost. Yuri Ribko, the protagonist, is a non-entity and his career as a cosmonaut is a non-starter, but the author does a good job evoking the world he inhabits (for a while), and a handful of conspiracy theories -- How did Yuri Gagarin really die? Why did three N-1 boosters in a row explode in flight? -- add spice to the Brezhnev-era bureaucracy and backbiting."
2,Not as advertised,Product was advertised as NEW but it had been opened. With this type of paper it needs to be brand new to confirm that it hasn't been exposed to light. Had to ship back. Company refunded $$ but I had to pay shipping back.
2,Bad Paper,"I had ordered this box of photo paper two semesters ago for a photography class I had. The paper I received was trash. The box was all ready opened by the time I had received it. But someone had done a good job of resealing the box with the special light blocking tape that was all ready on the box. The way I had known that the box was already open, was that the five sheets of paper I had used went completely black when I wad developing. The only way this could happen is if someone exposed to regular light. Whom ever you buy the paper from should be someone who deals with photography. The people I bought the paper from only sold item of people on here."
4,its been a while...,"The only previous paper i have used was a kodak paper (some years ago), now no longer readily available. This paper does not seem to have the corner durability in handling that i used to recall in the other paper i used."
1,London Dames a Disappointment,"This version of Dames at Sea is a great disappointment. The score has always been recognized as derivitive and trite, but the delightful performances of the original New York cast, especially Bernadette Peters, made it something special. Sorry to say, that is not the cast with this version. The recorded performances are amateurish at best. These people simply cannot sing. The whole thing is a disaster and should never have been released. Get Bernadette's version instead."
3,stick with the original Off-Broadway cast,"This London revival of DAMES AT SEA cannot even compare to the excellent original off-Broadway cast. Though Tina Doyle has an attractive singing voice in the ingenue role of Ruby, for me Bernadette Peters still defines that role. Her rendition of ""The Sailor of My Dreams"" doesn't carry the same charm as Peters' version. Doyle has no weight to her voice, and no real vibrato to speak of, either. Sandra Dickinson, Paul Robinson and especially Josephine Blake are all standouts on this record. DAMES AT SEA is a fantastic musical, but at the end of the day, I'll still go back to the Bernadette Peters version."
3,Good engine with weak couplers,The engine is good and runs well. The coupler at the rear of the engine was weak and broke. The engine did not couple to other train cars well at all. I will replace the coupler and the engine will be fine.
3,Not so hot,"Starts out great, then goes way down hill. It gets dull. It gets confusing. The plot jumps around. You can't follow the story. It could have been so much better"
3,"Interesting story, pretty terrible writing","The purported inside story of the 1992 Clinton campaign from about Sept 1991 through March 1992, with all of your favorite White House staff, under assumed names of course. Despite the media frenzy over the identification of ""anonymous"", I think that the book is pretty ordinary - and the author writes in a ponderous style. Read it only if you either like (or hate) Clinton, or if you want to be in at the next party"
1,A book that survives only as a gimmick,"I was amazed at the popular reception of this book after reading it. The characters, dialogue, and plot were all generally uninteresting, undeveloped, and entirely nonsensical. I felt by the end that had it not been bylined ""Anonymous,"" the literary world would have given this tome its deserved quick and quiet funeral."
2,I expected better!,"Characters were not well developed. Plot was very confusing. I found it difficult to remain interested in the story, since things jumped around so much. With all the hoopla, I expected a lot better."
2,Primary Colors are dull in this drab political landscape!,"No wonder this was originally attributed to Anonymous. Joe Klein doesn't really capture anything of substance here. The characters, regardless of who inspired them, are uninteresting political hacks who don't earn your interest or merit your time or attention. Jack Stanton, wife Susan and Henry are dull, pseudo-idealists who don't inspire or capture your imagination. Welcome to ""shamalot."" I really didn't care what happened to any of them. Read ""Advise and Consent"" if you desire good reading or some insight into the political process."
2,Tasteless tale of the worst aspects of contemporary politics,"No wonder the author attributed this book to ""Anonymous."" No self-respecting journalist would want to claim authorship of this account of low-life politics. It's on the level of the scandal rags displayed so prominently at your grocery store checkout.As other reviewers have mentioned, it's not so easy to read, either. There are too many characters, sketchily described. And the ending is ambiguous.Altogether, not worth the effort to read, not even at Amazon's cheap price."
3,An Interesting Book!,This proved to be an interesting book. The candidate took the reader on a wild ride through the Presidential primaries. You were given a blow by blow account of the trail to the White House by the author. If you paid close attention the candidate would remind you of one Bill Clinton. This book also spelled out some potential scandals and the candidate's staff attempts at damage control. Some of the scandals prove to be very interesting. The entry of the dark horse candidate into the presidential race also tended to make the run for the White House more interesting. Some times the book bogged down but all in all it proved to be an interesting read.
4,I found this to be a fine novel--to my VERY great surprise.,"I've been reading _about_ this book since it first appeared; I hadavoided it, because it didn't sound like anything I was interested in.All the ethical questions about it remain. And, particularlywhen the figures are so identifiable, I find the details of some ofthe episodes disturbing. Klein knows perfectly well that we'reall going to wonder whether ""Stanton's"" real-life counterpart could_really_ have done something like _that_.Nevertheless, this is a fine novel. It works very well _as a novel_. In fact,I enjoyed it every bit as much as Edwin O'Connor's ""The Last Hurrah""and I would put the two books in the same category.Thirty years from now, when the Clintons are as vague a memory as Curley istoday, I think people will still be reading this novel for itsvalue as a slice of late-twentieth-century life.But I still want to know: do they really call the press ""scorps""or did Joe Klein just make that up?"
2,"Inherently interesting,overwhelmed by poor writing and concl","This book started off in a whirlwind of intrigue and promise for the politicaljunkie but eventually stumbled to an unfullfilling ending. The parallels to the1992 campaign were remarkable, but these insights were overwhelmed by a tedious,almost stream of consciousness writing that got old quickly. If you read the firsttwo thirds and then put it down, you will be just as happy,if not happier, than if you finished it. The book is similar torecent political campaigns, the public starts off very interestedand then falls out of love with the candidates. This aspect of the book elucidatesthe political process."
4,An Interesting glimpse into the world of politics,"Primary Colors first caught my attension because I was very interested in the political process. As I read the book I found that while not brilliantly written, the book does show you things that you never could belive are true. The book has a very interesting bottom line as well, it's okay to lie in the elections if it's giving you oppurtunity to make good."
2,Why was this written?,"This is a book with very little point. I read it because I heard everything in it was true. That is easy to say because nothing is ever clearly stated it is eluded to. If the point of this book is that Clinton, or Stanton, as he is called in the book messed up every life he ever touched I didn't need a book to find that out it I and most people already know that. I gave this book two stars because the one good charcter in this story is Libby and she is entitled to the two stars."
1,"So disgusting, even if half true; I couldn't finish.","Could the first family of the United States really be asfoul and dysfunctional as the book described? If factual we are, indeed, in trouble as a nation on the decline. I am fairly broad-minded, but I could not bear to continue reading the 2nd half of this book. I returned it to the library, and apologized for having requested they order it."
2,Anonymous in many ways was the correct thing to do.,This book is not great. A lie would be what a great piece of writing. It is not absolutely terrible so it makes you cry either. Some bits are funny but showing the way a man goes through the American system and tries to become president is just not original. Also some English people won't get whats going on sometimes. For a political story go for something a bit more funny.
1,So what's new?,"I found it boring and depressing. Politics as usual. This is nothing new ya know.The people who have governed this country (heck!, the world) from the getgo have all been like this. It was just kept under wraps better. Too many leakers, climbers and journalists these days."
2,A profile in courage,"You gotta love a political pundit like Joe Klein. He didn't even have the decency to attach his name to his book. Wow, that's courage. That's a backbone.Let's see, Klein goes around slamming the Clinton presidency, anonymously. Thanks, Joe. America needs more brave souls like you.Go back to writing your drivel in Time Magazine. Frankly I am surprised you have the courage to attach your name to your columns."
3,It's aight,"I'm not 'gon say much 'bout this book but since I bought it used I found it'll be more interesting since I seen the movie with John Travolta in it. Yeah this book talk more 'bout politics and how it's creating in our nation. I think nobody should be disappointing 'bout this 'cuz it has so many shortcuts and all of that knahmsayin. (e.g. y'know's, y'see's (I don't even use that word much as often), y'understand's, y'knawhattasayin's, y'knawhattamean's, etc.). I'm not saying it's all bad, but it's still good tho but need a lotta information on the discovery of Bill Clinton b/c I wanna check out his memoir he put out last year before his undying health. I pray that he'll go well and do just fine. Anyway check this book b/c it has a lot of information about it."
5,"Sharp, witty, and wonderful!","I read this book a few months after it was published, and found it very hard to put down. Never mind working out who all the characters were supposed to be (although with some there wasn't much difficulty!), it was a fascinating insight into the murky world of political campaigning, of the reality that there are no perfect people out there - and if there were, they probably wouldn't want to be president.It was a novel approach to take the perspective of an idealistic campaigning lawyer drafted in to help with the Stanton bid; someone steeped in the political process and 'how to,' but who had rarely been exposed to the murkier sets of compromises and deals which candidates and their teams engage in.I loved it, and now I'm waiting for Klein's sequel, The Running Mate, to arrive in paperback."
5,I felt like a mouse in Anonymous's pocket,"Anonymous left me wondering why he didn't just use Clinton's name, or at least do something like ""Klinson""--I caught myself repeatedly distracted in trying to figure out who-was-who. There's no denying who it is about. Excellent ""fiction"" from an insider's perspective. One of the best out of fifteen books I have recently read about our unusual First Family. After reading the other books and then this book, and outside of requisite name changes, it became difficult to remember it was a work of fiction."
4,"really good, but not great","I found myself knee-deep in the muckracking in this book and loving it. My only problem was the half hearted attempt to incorporate Clinton's foibles. I probably would have enjoyed this better if I didn't have an actual polititian to picture as Stanton. His mixing of actual history (Audio phone calls recorded) with total fiction (impregnating teen girl), the author wrongly tarnishes the presidents image with wild speculation that maybe this really did happen. Stanton would have been a better character if he was completely fictional"
2,Somewhat out of date,"I bought this and the Cisco Security Specialist's Guide to PIX (Umer Kahn) together using the Amazon save-on-2 special. It's an ok book, but save your money and just get the Kahn book, a better book all around. It's the only book I could find that covers the CSPFA 3.0 exam objectives."
2,Good but...,"I bought this book recently and have read around 75% at the time of this review. My feeling is that it is a good reference book only. If you are looking for a straight and forward way to get start up with PIX, forget about it. There are more valuable information on Cisco web site and on the web.The author goes deep in explaining the syntax and each parameter but the examples come much too late to digest all the complexity he has gone through.It would have been easier for the reader to understand, if after each syntax is explained, a one line example is given.But once you get a good feel of your system and have your PIX up and running, you can use it, to understand how things work under the hood and implement more advanced features like VPN and IPSec."
4,A good book on Pix Platform,Complete strudy on Pix platform but there isn't a part on the Blade in Cat6500 Device based on pix tech.
4,ok,"the product arrived on time, too early to say the quality... i don't know yet the quality compared the org one, i guessed one thing for sure it's a lot cheaper..."
1,Come on...,In regard to a previous review Paul was on his way to Damascus not Emmaus. The book's not that good but the record needs to be correct. I would recommend you read Paul: A Novel by Walter Wangerin instead.
2,Not as good as the original recordings,An awesome recording group....LOVE all their stuff but this one is not up to par. Lacks finesse and feels improvised.
2,Disappointing and outdated,"I was disappointed with this book. A limited ingredient list is used over and over in some uninspiring combinations; nearly every recipe relies on either soy protein powder or whey protein powder, and neither one in my experience results in desserts that taste like *the real thing*.The only two sweeteners used are sucralose and stevia. No mention is made of other popular sugar alcohols like maltitol, xylitol, and erythritol. The book was published in Feb. 2003, maybe these sweeteners weren't as readily available then...At present you can find better recipes and learn more about new low-carb products by going online."
4,"some I like, some I don't",The no-carb waffles are now a staple recipe in my house. The brownies were horrid but maybe it was the sweetner I used.
3,Disappointed in the use of Splenda,I ran through the recipes and had to cross out most of them because they use Splenda. I can't use Splenda because I have a very adverse reaction to it. I guess I'll have to try to play with them using other substitutions.
2,Just didn't like the recipes,"I tried really hard to like this book, but almost everything I made turned out, well, yucky. I didn't like a single recipe that included any kind of protein powder (that includes most of the cookies, cakes, waffles and candies). The only exception was the mocha shake, although I had to omit half the gelatin to make it drinkable. I haven't tried any of the pie or psyllium-based cookie recipies, so I can't speak for those.That said, I really enjoyed the section on the art of indulgence, which I think is worth the two stars."
2,Rubbish,Another docudrama based on the life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.With all the footage available and now even the personal tapes of this woman's recollections and observations you would think someone would be able to make a half way decent documentary. I am sure the public that loved loved and admired her would much prefer that
3,Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis,"Poor choice of actress to play Jackie. A movie about JBK is always more interesting when the leading character highly resembles the actual person. If they look quite different from the original person the movie is about, the movie loses a lot of my interest in it."
3,Still deliberating,"I bought this CD in Amsterdam and I was so excited. I've heard so much about this guy, and finally I was holding his CD in my hands.I really don't know what to say about it, because it takes off kind of slow (so it's not a party starter) , but still the mixing and the atmosphere is good.The last song is by far the best on the entire set (Afrodisiac).If you're a progressive fan, you should buy it, because when you're at the beach with your friends the sound might work, but if it's your first time into progressive, wait some more, listent to hernan, or deep dish, cause otherwise you won't understand this album."
2,hardly captivating!,"Requires finer palate of appreciation for subtlety & nuance! Acting- good. There was too much suffering. And it was that what was expounded upon in the direction and plot of the story! Too long and drawn out purposely to make it a time framed Bollywood movie that at the end of it, you feel drained instead of requited with the characters that they finally consummated their love and lived happily ever after!"
1,Miscommunication,I don't understand how can one create a film solely based on MISCOMMUNICATION. But I gave it a chance and sat through the end somehow.It looked like a pitiful attempt to salvege the movie by making the characters the part of some sentimental times in India.
1,"Maybe good for a therapist, useless for a paitient","If you are interested in learning more about self-injury because it is something you do or something a family member does, steer clear of this book! It's a series of self-important ramblings disguised as case studies, offering very little actual insight."
1,Off Base,"Having read this book, I have to say that Mr. Levenkron has gotten some of his facts wrong. He makes self-injury into a form of psychosis, as opposed to the coping mechanism it is (even if it is maldaptive). He views it entirely as a sickness, and never seems to fully take into account why his clients use this form of coping.I find this book to be almost insulting as it invalidates all reasons a person might have for using such a painful coping mechanism, which at the same time causes an invalidation of the person. There are some excellent books on the market that address self-injury; this is definitely NOT one of them."
5,Cutting,"I found this book right on about reasons for cutting and great insights into why, when, etc. adults cut themsleves. It is non-judgemental and is great for cutters and therapists and loved-ones to read if they really want to understand. It was the first time I ever felt like I wasn't totally alone with this horrible secret and the first time I felt like someone understood and wasn't judging me for it."
1,made me feel like a statistic .,"i myself have dealt with cutting, i still deal with it everyday, and this book not only made me feel like a statisitc but it also didn't touch a lot of subjects. this book made me want to cut myself while i was reading it. i highly suggest reading another if you are a self-injurier, or if you are just reading about it."
5,Great Book!,This book is a great book! It helped a lot for my research paper. I'll say buy it with no doubts!
4,Great book.,"Wether you're reading this to understand yourself, a friend or family member, or, like me, researching the subject, this book is a fantastic entry into understanding the mental causes of self-mutilation. The author is right about how cutters are viewed. When I told friends I was reading and researching self-mutilations, the conversations changed quickly to the most surface-level benality they could come up with on the spot.Mostly, this book is very informative. I would have liked to hear less case studies (...) and more of the reasons why a person turns to cutting, what psycholocical catalysts there are.If you choose to read this book, be prepared to get odd looks -- you'll be venturing into territory no one like to acknowledge."
1,Smelling Like Roses - Or Not,"Levenkron approaches every patient he ever had with stern directness. While it's nice to have a no-nonsense attitude, he only includes patients with whom he's had success so that he comes out smelling like roses.There is little solid implication that therapy is in development for self-harm, and it is irresponsible to present case history information with the idea that two pages per person (half of which is self-agrandizement) adequately expostulates their plights. This book, in my opinion, is a psychology disaster.I urge people in therapy and also caregivers to take great care in diversifying research material beyond this book, but to read it anyway, if only to get a ground-idea about some of the twisted ideas and myths that float among therapists regarding the subject matter."
5,An important book.,"I was speaking with a friend of mine about self-mutilation, and her response was mixed with anger, frustration, confusion and repulsion. Dr. Levenkron addresses issues that are all too common reactions by the general public. Just like he did nearly two decades ago with anorexia, Levenkron brings an important insight into a harmful disorder. He very astutely points out the fact that when anorexia was first being noticed, many in the medical field and the public reacted in the same manner that they do with self-mutilation. I recommend that anyone who knows, or thinks they know of someone who might be suffering from this disorder, reads this book. Even if you don't, do so just because you care. A better understanding, awareness and compassion needs to be attained."
4,A Triggering Title.,"I read this book almost a year ago and it is very informative. However, I find the title of the book to be in poor taste. I feel the author could have chosen a more appropriate title to state the obvious..."
2,Disappointing...,"I self-injured for many years as a teen and young adult. Only recently have I found books that have helped open a window into the question of ""why?"" Unfortunately, this book wasn't so compelling. I found the explanations trite and condescending... Unlike other books, the author seemed to have a hidden contempt for people who self-injure. Do you recall what it was like to have your mother or father speak to a neighbor about you- even though you were right there in the room? That is exactly how it felt to read this book."
1,an ignorant and damaging study of a serious syndrome,"Self injury is an area of psychological study that has been seriously misrepresented in public literature. Levenkron has done a great disservice to the community and to self injurers by continuing this all too common error. This book is not a fair examination of a very serious syndrome, but a biased and incomplete book designed more to provide a soapbox for Levenkron's studies in anorexia nervosa. This is not helpful for anyone trying to understand self injury. ""Cutting"" is a great step backwards for everyone striving to understand self injury as a very real problem."
4,Good book on a tough subject,"I found this book quite helpful. I am working with a young woman who has a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. A number of other therapists and a Residential Treatment Center had not had much success. Several family members are also involved, and this book was very helpful in explaining (in laymen's terms) what was probably going on, and why I was taking the position I had in treating her. Prognosis is fair to poor, but this book gave reason for some hope."
4,What I Expected,"Good Price, Good Quality. Came in a reasonable time. The only difference was it didn't have the fancy cover, just cardboard, but the product was the same."
4,camulet multigrade paper,"the delivery was on time, the product was packadge correctly... i just find a little inperfection in one of the boxes, but it wasnt nothing serious.the final product was perfect."
2,"It works, but only if you are right in front of it.","I ended up having to buy the ""long distance"" Wii wireless sensor bar even though my TV is only 7'-8' from the TV. This thing only worked well inside 5'. Boo."
3,ITS OK,I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER THE MOVIE COVER WAS MORE APPEALING THAN THE MOVIE ITSELF. NOT ALL LOW BUDGET FILMS SUCK BUT THIS ONE KINDA DID. THEN AGAIN THATS ONLY IF U WANT MY OPINION
5,Really well done,I work with special needs children on a daily basis and this movie really reflected the disabilities very well. It was a very nice story that really warmed your heart.
3,"Mozart and the Whale - odd title, worthy film","WHAT THE BOX DOESN'T TELL YOUThe movie will be hard to withstand in some parts purely because this is a movie about Asperger's Syndrome (a functional form of autism). If you are renting this movie because of either of the primary characters, Josh Hartnett and Radha Mithcell, be prepared for this to be a departure from those films. If you like the synopsis on the box, you'll like this movie.WHY I WOULD RENT IT AGAINI like to pick quirky movies, which sit on the shelves by themselves, or with only one or two other copies. There's a uniqueness about this movie, and those like it. I am sure it has something to do with Ron Bass's (screenplay, Rain Man) intricately woven storytelling about persons with disabilities. Although I liked Josh Hartnett in other roles, this really sheds some light on his potential growth ability when it comes to acting."
2,Flat,"Ron Bass won an Oscar for his screenplay Rain Man and like so many people who have tried to replicate their success with a similar work, here he has failed. Mozart and the Whale takes us into the world of two people who suffer from Asperger's, a form of autism, but where Rain Man was compelling and moving, Mozart and the Whale falls flat. Josh Harnett gives a pretty good performance and Rhada Mitchell is charming and attractive, but these two actors can't fix a terribly flawed script."
1,"trying to be unique, but the contrary, too much stereotyped...","It might be interesting to a person who knows nothing about Aspergers or PDDs. It is not not insightful or smart.It is stereotyped. Acting is weak. They should have got more expert advice. Idea is good, the product is not."
3,Average,This movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.I found Isabell to be annyoing at points and selffish.I thought she acted more like she was bipolar but I'm not expert.Overall I found this movie to be average.It's worth a rental but not a buy.A better movie about Asperger's Syndrome would be Adam.Check that movie out first.
3,"Cheap packaging scheme, terrifice movies!","I have no qualms with any of these movies. In fact, I liked the Painted Veil the best. What I didn't like so much were the two discs that had one movie on each side. I know that it's a bargain-price movie package, but couldn't they at least have two movies on the same side? It's annoying when you put in a movie only to realize that it's the wrong movie and then have to take out the DVD to flip it to the right side. Otherwise, it's a good movie set, although, I would try to get these movies on their own."
5,Great set,"I bought it for one of the movies (Silk), but I watched another (Painted Veil) and I loved it. I can't wait to watch the other two movies - what a great deal."
3,Hit or Miss,"Almost hard to believe this is the same group that did ""And Failed Destruction"".""Recalled Moments"" is a little hit or miss, but not a bad one to own for the fan of the genre. Front 242 has always had an edge on trying new techniques, and this is no exception. And rather than a complete disaster as with their ""And Failed Destruction"" release, ""Recalled Moments"" has some good ones. I particularly like ""Louder than Silence"", MoF actually has a good vocal style.But then you also have tracks like ""Explain"", which, yeah, could use some explaining. One minute's worth of noise and feedback loops, hooray.Overall I'm rating this one as 3-stars because the quality tracks are outnumbered by the overly-bizarre. It's a good CD if you feel you must have the whole collection (or if you like the bizarre) but the typical fan can skip this and rest assured they aren't missing much."
2,Unstable,"While this lazy susan is beautiful, the base is very small and there fore makes the top very wobbly. We had to return it (same day)."
5,fun sticker book for toddler and preschool set,"For a recent trip we bought a large number of sticker and activity books for our toddler. These in the Sticker Stories series were very popular and helped make the trip a pleasant one.There are seven colorful two-page spreads and one one-page picture on which to place stickers. These show various scenes, including a rural area, an airport, an air show, city air space, a forest fire, an aircraft carrier, outer space and a night scene. There are over 70 reusable stickers to place within these scenes, including jets, space shuttles, satellites, and helicopters.We will definitely buy more activity books from this series."
2,If only the stickers stuck,"This book could be better than many as it truly has well written text and interesting scenes. However, the stickers don't stick. I don't mean you can't peel them up and reuse them--I mean that they do not ever stick to the page and curl up on the edges, even on the first application. What a disappointment! Improve the glue and this is a 5-star book."
2,Military Aircraft Included,"There are some great titles in this series, but if you're avoiding weapons or warfare at this age level, you'll want to skip this book."
4,"Indonesia Travel Pack, 6th (Globetrotter Travel Packs)","Information is so simple and relatively up to date, and maps are great, made me never got lost. However newest/less known interesting place still not written there."
3,"Right questions, Wrong answers!","The author pointed out the absurdity of our belief in ""sustainable growth"". Unfortunately his solutions to the problem is the same as the title of this book--be an ostrich. Hardin just told us to shut the door and go on enjoying our last feast of Malthus."
1,not what expected,this book was not at all what I expected. first of let me just say that NO... it does not compare to Fifty Shades of Grey. It did have some kinky stuff but it's way toooo harsh for my taste. I just did not like it at all.
1,LOTS of cruel spanking,"If you're into the idea of blistering spankings almost without end, buy this book. Spankings to correct behavior is one thing, but these spankings were cruel -- undeserved, vicious, and long-lasting punishments. The other book in the series where Sleeping Beauty is sent to the village for punishment was tamer!"
2,Not for everybody,"I'll admit that I knew what I was getting myself into when I read the book. At first it was weird but in a way that makes you keep reading because you're curious...then it just got weird. I'm not knocking the book or the author, it just wasn't my cup of tea. The extremely anatomically correct terminology mixed with the weird things that are happening in the story just made me give up on the book. Like I said, not for everybody."
1,Highly disturbing,"From my point of view, the entire story is based on the rape, beating and humiliation of this one woman at the hands of anyone who comes into contact with her. I'm sorry this is in my brain."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"I really wish I'd done more research before buying this trilogy. I saw that it was an Anne Rice book, and I've read a lot of Anne Rice over the years. This book is HORRIBLE. Badly written, repetitive. I keep waiting for there to be a plot, but mostly it's just spanking, humiliation, spanking, more spanking, and oh yes, spanking. OVERKILL. Somebody should do a word count to see how many times the word spank appears. Seriously, I think I might burn these books to get some enjoyment out of them."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I am an Anne Rice fan and I enjoy erotic literature and ideas, but I was disappointed with this book. Although there were some genuinely erotic moments, it seemed that the vast majority of the book was devoted to degradation and humiliation. The story showed no restraint (pun intended), but rather seemed to wallow unrelentingly in extremely masochistic themes. For those who do not find pain, torture and rape erotic, there is little to enjoy."
5,Very good Xrated read,I was very very pleased with this book. The condition was good for the price and it was well written. It was exactly what i expected and more. This is not a book for anyone under the age of 18 or anyone who does not like bdsm. I would have to say it is one of the best books I read this year.
1,S & M,Arrrgghh.... I wish I had seen the other reviews before buying this! I had no idea it was S & M... truly depressing and degrading material... I started reading it last night. It was so bad I flipped to the last quarter to see if the poor heroine would at least get her due and all I saw was more S&M. Truly awful.
2,The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty,I was not impressed and will not be reading the other two books in the series.
1,Terrible,"This book is nothing but hard core porn. I didn't even finish it, it had so much in it that made me sick! I sent it back and felt it was a terrible book."
1,Just so...,"This does not compare to 50Shades in any way, this story is just lewd, cruel & nasty. If there was plot I missed it with the barberious cruelty!"
2,2 stars for the trainwreck,"I heard about this book and unfortunately bought it before I could read the reviews here. I didn't know a book could be boring and over-the-top at the same time. Her descriptions of the punishments are so ludicrous and repetitive, that I found myself skipping them over. Beauty seems to have no personality or thought processes and the end is utterly confusing. All that said, I want to find out what happens in the next book! I just don't want to spend money on it! Hopefully I can find it in the library, although I doubt it."
1,Horrible!,"After reading 50 Shades of Grey and Bared to You, I researched my next book to read, and saw this one. Big mistake! The book is horrible. Absolutely not believable and the author is trying too hard to be an erotic writer. I suffered through it, and the ending was ridiculous. Sorry Ms. Rice, but I will never read any of your books again. I'll just wait till the 2nd book of Bared to You comes in October. Ladies this book is a major let down if you liked 50 Shades! Don't waste your time with this one."
3,The Claiming Of Sleeping Beauty.,"Oh for goodness sake people it's a D/s novel and it's a fantasy, it may not be the best written book ever but lighten up."
2,UMMMMM....,"A perverted twist on the tale of Sleeping Beauty. She does not end up with a loving Prince Charming, oh no. The prince that has the privalage of waking her up enslaves her! He makes her do all kinds of stuff that's degrading IMO.My god, if I were her, I would have totally kneed him where it counts. I am by no means a prude, but this book was so degrading I couldn't even finish it."
1,Not at all like 50 Shades of Grey,This book in my opinion is not at all like 50 Shades of Grey which I found captivating and simply could not wait to see how it all worked out. As others noted this book is repetitive and disturbing - not a well balanced relationship. Not my idea of erotica. I am not even sure I can finish this book.
3,Different,"I was shocked and angered by the treatment of the slaves. The Prince is just royalty 2 so shouldn't he ALSO be a slave??? I hated the queen, and think she was a sick individual. But still, I had to read on, because the book was so spellbinding. Plus, because I had spent a lot of money on it. I thought it was unfair, and degrading to the royals. I got used to the spanking after a while. The book was all in all sick and unusual. If I was there I think I would have murdered someone. Anyways, it's consoling 2 know it's not real. But still, there is something very compelling about the book, that makes you want 2 read the whole series."
2,Not great,Was looking for something to 'fill the void' after finishing the 50 shades series so picked these up. I didn't really like the books. I finished the second and third book with alot of skimming. The 'adult' portions of the book were nothing like 50 shades and somewhat disturbing to read. Seemed extremely repetitive.
1,Waste of money and time!,Terrible! It's not worth 1 star! There is no comparison to Fifty Shades of Grey! The whole trilogy awful there is no real dialogue between characters because the main characters are mostly slaves that aren't allowed to speak.
1,Are you kidding?,"Definitely not what I thought it would be! Was looking for something a little racy, sexy and this was not it. Too much humiliation, not enough romantic sex. couldn't get beyond the first few chapters. Maybe it got better, but I'll never know."
1,Hated it!,Stopped reading a third of the way through and I NEVER do that! I felt like there was no plot.
1,This is not BEAUTY,This lacks story line. Content is repetative and boring.50 Shades was MUCH better written. This is my firstreading of anything Anne Rice has written and I am notsure about reading any of her subsequent books. I willneed to get past this one and move on for awhile beforeI consider her other books.
2,Disappointed by Anne Rice,"I've read other stories by Anne Rice and this one was not as well written. The characters were not developed at all, in fact the setting was also not developed. Story could have been better and still included all the romantic scenes."
1,A waste of money.,"Couldn't even get into the second chapter. It was recommended by a friend after we had both read ""Fifty Shades of Gray""."
3,Not your Fairy Tale Beauty!!!,"The only thing this book has in common with the Fairy Tale, is about the first 2 or 3 pages, and then it goes down a dark, sexual path..... It's a little brutual in parts(I think)... it's not what I expected from Anne Rice..... She has taken Sleeping Beauty to the S&M path. After awhile you know what's going to happen, the common thread is punishment.... both sexual and physical...lots of physical...... Not sure I'm going to read the other 2 books in this series......"
2,Child molestation is not my idea of a good read,"If you imagine that the characters in this book are all consenting adults, then this is a decent read. Unfortunately they aren't. The book begins with the Prince raping and awakening 15-16 year old beauty. Yes, raping her. She wasn't awake to give consent. I got half way through this book and couldn't read any more. I have yet to find one mention where any of the 'slaves' give any form of consent at all. A lot of the slaves seem to be 15-20 years old. A book about children being beaten brutally is not my idea of a good read. Any slave showing their unwillingness to do something is punished severely, brutally and cruelly. It is just not a sexy book. If it were completely consensual and all characters were adults, it would be a fairly decent book, unfortunately, they aren't."
2,Never-ending Spank-Fest. Where's the Sex?,"Although I would say the book is worth reading simply to be able to say you did, I have to worn you: It would be half as long if the spanking sessions were taken out. No,.. I'm not talking about spanking along with sex. I'm talking about pages and pages of descriptive spanking. And where is the sex? Oh! There it is! Those 3 sentences in the last chapter! Although I can say the book WILL turn you on and will push you through to the end, I found myself skimming over entire pages as I thought, ""Dear God,.. not another spanking."" It just got old after a while.The main thrust of the story is a beautiful and brilliant concept, but i could've written better. Makes you wonder what goes on behind Anne's closed doors."
3,"It was ok, but for the tougher side of BDSM","I had to give it a 3 because I could not choose 2.5 stars.......I read it in no time flat but I agree with most, unless you are really into spanking and humiliation this might not be for you. I'm not ashamed to admit that my husband and I try things to spice up our love life and we've even delved into the soft side of bondage and spanking but this was a BIT much! I have looked everywhere to try and find something to read that will thrill me as well as give me ideas and this just didn't cut it. I'm not interested in reading about repeated rape, torture and himiliation though the other ""softer"" points, I did enjoy"
1,Not Erotic,"Perhaps I'm jaded, but it takes a little more than repetitive acts of S & M to get me off. Also, Anne Rice needs to understand a little about the subject on which she writes. For one thing, it is generally the powerful that enjoy being dominated, not the weak, so Beauty's enjoyment of pain is a mistake. The powerful prince should be the one to enjoy torture. If you're reading this review in contemplation of purchasing the book, let me sum the plot up for you. Prince Charming takes Beauty to his S & M castle. That's it."
1,Not in any way similar to Fifty Shades,"Skimming through the first chapter convinced me to waste my $12.99, besides the ""if you're looking for something to fill the void of Fifty Shades"". Spankings, etc. by Christian Grey were hot and sexy. The torture inflicted on the 'love slaves' in Beauty makes you wish the prince and all his people would come to a violent end. There's nothing sexy or romantic about it. I'm trying to force myself to skim through and finish it, but not sure I can."
1,This story is disgusting,"This was the most repellent and sickeing, deprived, story I have ever read, very disturbing for a weak mind... I have read thousand of story and exotic too. but nothing like this sick...sick... what-ever... this thing is."
2,Unbelievable.,"I feel compelled to read this book every three or four years. It's as close as I come to Erotica without feeling creepy. The story is a Faery tale so of course it's not going to be literal. Yes, there is way too much spanking (I have never understood the appeal of getting off on being spanked). I definatly prefer backrubs and chocolates.The Bridal Path is also something I could just not get my head around. I couldn't even fathom how it would play out in my imagination.I think the world Ms. Rice creates here is as awful as it is original. It's shocking and horrific so yes, it has the horror element going for it as well.I just can't understand why the sex slaves never rise up and beat the hell out of their tormentors. Weird."
1,Modern women don't serve anyone!,"...I was thoroughly discusted with this book! ...I enjoy erotica, but this was not it. It was disturbing and filled with terrifying mental images. Beating people until they bleed is not sensual, its sick! There is enough torture in the world around us, I certainly do not want to read about it, glorified in a book. I didn't finish the book, nor will I ever purchase another one of Anne Rice's books."
2,"Titillating, but slightly lacking on the. . .well, everything","I have read and re-read all three books on numerous occasions, hoping to find the hidden, deeper reasoning behind it. In these readings, I eventually find myself skipping past the long diatribes of why this submission is so rewarding to some of them, and just reading the tawdry gay and lesbian sex. And yes, there is a LOT of spanking. If you are interested in learning about BDSM, stay away from these books, as they do no more than confuse the hell out of you. I agree with the other reviewer, that I'm fairly certain this was not the socioeconomic trials of Medieval Europe."
4,Master and Slave - who really is in charge?,"This book is a wonderful, erotic, adult version of the fairy tale. It gives the reader insight into the world of BDSM and the dom/sub life style.It will make you blush in places, even if you are an avid reader of erotica, like I am. It will satisfy your sexual curiosity and your romantic nature. Ultimately, it will take you on a wild emotion, sexual ride, and, much like a roller coaster ride, it will leave you panting and begging for more."
2,Uncomfortable.,"They say this book is comparable to 50 Shades of Grey, and I must disagree. It is far more about pain than pleasure. There is absolutely no love involved. The story of Ana and Christian is a story of a relationship that just has an interesting sex life, but the story of beauty is about humiliation and complete and total submission. It's disgusting. I can not believe that any person, male or female, would want to be in the position of either Beauty or the Prince. This book is just too much. Sure some of the racy scenes were hot, but it was just too much for me."
4,not for the faint of heart,"i read the series and it wasn't so much that i ""loved"" the book but I just had to know what happened next. It will make your mouth fall open. but i just couldn't feel for Beauty."
2,Not my favorite Anne Rice book,"I purchased this book, only after it was recommended as a must read for any Fifty Shades fan and it was not my cup of tea. It bored me to say the least and I quickly lost interest in it."
1,very poorly written,"With so much hype, I was looking forward to reading this book. The writing is just awful and the story didn't keep my interest at all. The story was more the problem than anything. I did like 50 shades, though 3 books was a little overkill but this is an author I will never read again. Total waste of time and money."
1,Sexual torment and abuse of children,"I find these books very very disturbing. It is not erotica it's torment and abuse. IT IS NOT LIKE FIFTY SHADES OF GREY AT ALL. All Anne Rice does is describe these characters abuse and it is the same thing over and over again. Chapter after chapter of the same ""punishment"" and no real story line. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
3,the claiming of sleeping beauty trilogy,"it was an ok read, nothing special by any means. definatley enjoyed reading the 50 shades trilogy a WHOLE lot more."
1,Didn't even finish,Degrading and demoralizing. Made it half way thru and had to stop reading. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
1,Horribly Disgusting,"I am a few chapters into the book, and so far it is the worst thing I have ever read. First, the Prince is 18 and Beauty is 15. She is constantly ""punished"" and screwed on any given occasion. She is made to speak only when spoken to and is not allowed to wear clothing, even in front of her parents. Excuse me? What kind of person would gladly write child porn and sell it openly? Part of me wants to keep reading because I feel bad for Beauty and hope that things get better for her, but at this point I think it will only get worse."
1,Blecccchhhhhhh!!!!,"This was just a terrible book. In her forward, Ann Rice compares her story to, and says she preceeded Fifty Shades and the concept of dom/sub. But hers is taken to a weird extreme and in my limited humble opinion on the subject, it's NOT provocative or sexy, or even interesting. If you could give negative stars for a review, this book would get it.And in addition to the excrutiating read, it made my knees hurt!"
3,Slow and repetitive,feels like you're missing something with the background. S and M is repetitive with little plot to the story underneath.
1,Terrible,"Don't deserve one star, terrible! This is more abuse then love and made me sick. I loved Fifty Shades of Grey, but this was nothing like it."
4,Not a standard bed-time story...,"I found myself thouroughly enjoying this book and the sequels, because I didn't get the idea that it was just a sordid romance/erotica novel. The story itself was inspired, and the characters played into it and grew as the novels progressed. You could seem to watch Beauty change with the ideas presented to her, her growth as a character was what made the novels so good.However the ideas presented may seem vile or aweful to a puritan reader, the exploration of sexuality in the characters was gratifying and I found myself challenging my own sexual views. It takes a flexible mind set to get into some aspects and some of the luridness,and the need for certain details leaves you wanting more. It's almost a bit of a paradox.Rice's voice and storytelling ability are wonderful, if only there was more substance to these books."
1,couldn't even finish it,This was THE worst book I have ever read. It was so stupid and not even amusing. I was so bored that I couldn't even finish it
1,it's garbage,"I usually like Anne Rice's stuff, but you have to some kind of loser to think this was anything other than a medium for her to vent her obvious sexual frustration. Total crap, just mind-numbing s&m with no plot, character development, etc. I have no problem with erotica, but I guess you have to be really into being abused to get turned on by this at all. If you're not in to that, don't read this book for any other reason cause there's nothing else there."
2,Not recommended,I have 6 words already! That is why I don't fill these out!I have 6 words already! That is why I don't fill these out!
1,This book is absolute crap,"This book is a waste of the ink and paper used to produce it. Having it advertized as ""if you liked 50 Shades of Grey, you'll Love The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy"" is so misleading and extremely disappointing. I can't believe I've wasted my time reading this book and I certainly won't waste my money on finishing the trilogy."
2,"Fiction, but come on!","Let's be real. The characters in this book and the other books in the trilogy are far, too well adjusted. Being repeatedly raped and dehumanized does not create a well rounded person as Anne Rice is portraying. She presents the happenings as a Dom/Sub society to help the reader deal with and ignore the brutality. Beauty & Laurent ride off to live happily ever after? At least she kept it a Fairy Tale in the end."
1,AWFUL!!!,"I generally do not consider myself a prude, but this was WAY TOO MUCH! I ordered the trilogy, was excited when it got here, and dove right in, and was horribly let down. I kept reading through page sixty something, thinking that an actual story would begin to take shape, but it was not to be. At that point I was disturbed and disgusted, I seriously worry about anyone who enjoys this book. I like a raunchy story, but rape, beatings, humiliation, and any annoying amount of spankings??? All three books are in my garbage can, unfinished and unread, and my life will be better because of it."
1,disgusted,"I bought this book Several months ago and recently someone asked me about it. I did not find this book very enjoyable it was difficult for someone ""rape survivor"" to read. I do not suggest this book to anyone who has survived a rape or been in a domestic violence relationship. Unfortunately I could not return the purchase and believe me i had tried. I only read the first few chapters and decided right away this book was not a good read for someone like me. I am sure others might find it enjoyable but i am truly disgusted with it"
3,This is not 50 shades!,"The book is well written. Ann Rice is a phenomenal author. However, the reviews that say ""if you like 50 shades you will love this"" are misleading. I purchased this book believing that it would be in the same ball park, but it isn't even close. It just wasn't my type of book. With that being said, it was still so well written, that I couldn't really put it down. If you like dark and torturous, it should be right up your alley."
1,BORING!!!!,i am an avid reader and I could not get past the first chapter... I would not recommending this book especially if you liked Fifty Shades of Gray.
2,Too out there,In the preview of book compared this to Fifty Shades. Not even close. Too far out there and not even believable. Disturbing. Will not read the other two books in series.
1,Not what I was looking for...,"I'm a fan of some of Anne Rice's books, but she seems to vary wildly in quality and tone, so I'm never sure whether I'll love or hate the next book. I was curious about this trilogy because I thought it would be neat if pornography were written by someone with real talent. My complaint isn't that the sex offended me (obviously you'll want to avoid these books if you're offended by ""mature themes""), but the problem is that they just aren't well written. There's a starting point and an ending point, but it appears that each chapter in between is merely an exercise in whatever sort of sexual escapade she felt like writing that day. So it's just a collection of sloppy writing and disjoint incidents, and (I'm not a connoisseur of pornography, so maybe this isn't fair) it's probably no special addition to the porn genre."
1,the entire series was a waste of my life,"so I started reading this book after I read bared to you and let me tell you this is nothing close to erotic. this series is more about princess and princesses being used as sex slaves and its claimed that they're being taught when really they're just being humiliated and tormented. This book doesn't mention anything but spanking, paddles, spanking, sobbing, spanking, buttocks, spanking, spanking and more spanking. thats all it is is spanking and how people touch their sex and people tug on their nipples and crawling naked. the whole book is repetitive and pointless. I don't even recommend reading this book to see if you like it."
2,"A bit ""hard core"" for me...",This book was a little to hard core for me. I am sure others enjoy it... just is not the book foe me..
1,Claiming of Sleeping Beauty,"This book was awful, I really like her Interview with a Vampire series and the Mayfair Witches, but this was just awful. It's focus is on spanking, for discipline, for pleasure and spanking on all the places you can imagine, crawling around naked (they can't wear clothes). Loved 50 Shades and Bared to You, but don't waste your time on this one. By the way did I tell you it was AWFUL!"
1,WOW,"This has got to be the worst book I've ever read and am glad I only bought the first book instead of the whole trilogy!In my opinion, there is no story line only a bunch of sex slaves constantly getting spanked...definitely not for me!! I am shocked it was even compared to ""Fifty Shades"" as there is no comparison!"
2,The worst erotic work I've read,"ive read all three of her Beauty books and they are simply horrible...she was so into making the work as hot as possible, she forgot to include a story!!! Exit to Eden was a wonnderful work..what happened??? There is alot more to S/M erotica than tears and whips...how did the characters really feel..???"
1,Save your money for some other book,Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. I read the first 4 chapters and decided there were too many good books to read to waste my time. Too bad I couldn't send the book back to amazon.com for a credit. Save your money and buy some other book that is better written and erotic rather than someone's nightmare.
1,Boring!!,"I tried reading this a few years back before fifty shades was even heard of, and although I feel bad that this book which came first is now getting it's hype due to people saying it's like fifty shades, I must say that fifty shades was ten times more better than this. There at least was a story line in fifty, in this book it was nothing but spankings page after page and the men making her do what they wanted. There was no romance or even any erotica. I can't even say this is BDSM because I don't think nothing but spanking qualifies in that department. For you very few who like this that's great, we are all entitled to our own opinion but this book doesn't even deserve to be in the same category as fifty, let alone be a book where ""if you liked fifty shades of grey then try this"", it's just boring and although usually if I lend my books out I want them back, this is one my borrower may keep. I really hate that amazon won't let you give zero stars as giving one was hard enough."
