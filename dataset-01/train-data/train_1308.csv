1,Do not buy this!!!,"I bought this item through amazon (Tiger Direct) - got it home, it worked fine on one hard drive, then I plugged it into a perfectly good, working 160GB maxtor drive and the drive started smoking badly from the motherboard and had to be unplugged before it caused a fire!Now my 160gb no longer even boots up! I am so displeased with this cheaply made converter, and it ruined my hard drive!"
4,It works,"Got this for $14.99+tax from surplus computers, no shipping charge, as I bought from retail store in person.After struggling a day, finally I realized that I was connecting upside down to the drive- (it fits in either way)- and to make it work it has to be ""correctly"" connected to the drive- (following the arrows marked on the adapter). Also it is necessary to change the jumper settings of the drive to make it ""Master""- (if not already). I observed that ""Cable Select"", ""Slave"" both did not work. When these two points are followed, it worked great- I tried Hard Drive, CD drives etc.The following are my obsevations:(1) If you connect upside down- windows(xp) will show ""IDE to USB"", then it will show ""USB Mass Storage"", then it will show ""A problem occured while installing your hardware- it may not work properly."" No drive will show up.Probably this is what happened to earlier reviewers for whom it never worked.(2) If you do not make the drive as Master:Nothing will show up."
2,USB to IDE,"my new computer never read this, my bad hard drive started turning after the power was connected and working but was never detected by my new window 7 computer and I set it as master too. so do not know if the problem is the device or my hard drive."
3,"Works well, IF you get a good one","I bought one of these from eBay. It was completely defective (Windows didn't even see a device plugged in). I got another one from surplus computers. In w2k, this one complained about ""Function Driver not Specified for this Device Instance"". In winME, it just said ""unrecognized device."" In winXP, it didn't complain at all, but just didn't work. For techies: the Vendor and Product PnP ID were both returned as 0. Returned that one to the store, and have had no trouble with the new one. The enclosed instructions say to set your drive to master, and power up all before plugging USB cable in. VERY IMPORTANT."
4,Sergeant Rutledge,"One of the best DVD's I've seen, short of Blu-Ray quality. This is an almost forgotten classic. Solid acting and fantastic direction from John Ford. Looked great on my high definition T.V."
3,"Some interesting information, but we didn't need it","The Lamaze method is very popular, with some good reasons-- it does help, in any physical endeavor, to focus one's breathing. Fine. But delivering naturally is going to cause the mother PAIN. Its just the way the process works, and you just have to go through it.But some of us don't ever get to that point. Turns out I had to have a c-section. HAD TO. I'm not disappointed about it at all-- it was necessary for the safety of both the baby and myself. So having a baby does entail pain-- whether during actual labor or recovering from major abdominal surgery.The absolute focus on delivering naturally is very wearing, and their attempts to 'support' the fact of c-sections seems very strained. If you know a section is in your future, give this one a miss."
5,great read!,"This book is better than I expected. My advice would be to start reading well in advance of lamaze classes. Sometimes the breathing seems complicated. But when you've read it and then see it in class, it will all come together. I love the quotes from actual patients. They help you to understand it will be different for eveyone but you can adjust. I feel extremely confident and ready for natural childbirth!"
4,Good Book,"This book, in combination with the dvd ""Having Your Baby! A Complete Lamaze Prepared Childbirth Class"" are perfect together. It is a good way to review as both follow much of the same information and set up basically the same way.I read another book written by Dr. Lamaze himself that was a great start to understanding the psychoprophylaxis method and Lamaze in general."
1,More frightening than useful.,"Being a first time mother, I was looking for a book that would help me along with my Lamaze classes. This was not the book. The authors seem to be Gung-Ho anti-hospital with their critiques of the admitting processes of hospitals to the use of intravenous and medicines administered during childbirth. They concentrate on the risk of infection that can be contracted from standard hospital procedures to the point of paranoia. The authors attempt to make the reader more informed but just end up scaring them with all of the obstetrical textbook jargon. In a sense, it reads more like a 'Worst Case Scenario' handbook.Before reading, I was nervous about childbirth, even having heard a few horror stories from family members and friends, since I reading it, I have become absolutely frightened."
4,Good overall information,"I got this book in order to get an overview of the Lamaze method. The book was very informative, and I enjoyed that it also had a chapter for partners as well."
1,Don't buy this book unless you are having a baby in 1987!,"I was in a hurry (due with my 2nd next week) and wanted a refresher on the Lamaze breathing techniques and thought this book looked good and would offer some additional interesting information. If I had noticed it was from 1987 I wouldn't have bought it. Not only are the breathing techniques not straightforward, some of the general information is outdated. I live in small town and our hospital has not used forceps in delivers for years due to the risks. In addition, the part about giving your baby water the first few days - you should never give your infant water under 6 months of age - ask a pediatrician that's current, not old school. I stopped reading . . . buy at your own risk."
2,"Nice for ""repeat mom's"" but VERY outdated","I took Lamaze class with my first pregnancy and found it very informative and helpful. Although when it came down to the process I was overwhelmed with pain and lost control. With this second pregnancy, I wanted to review the Lamaze method so that this time I would know what to expect and have the tools with how to deal with it. The Lamaze class could not fit into my schedule so I looked to books. This book was nice for a mom who is just reviewing the techniques. It is VERY outdated and I believe even scary for the first time mom who does not know what to expect.So I think this would be a fine book to review the Lamaze method, but that is about all it is good for!"
5,Price fan and cancer survivor,"I first read this in 1995, during the long week prior to surgery to remove a growing mass of cancer that, thankfully, has never revisited me. Aside from, once again, being awed by Price's magic with otherwise common words, it was especially comforting to read the very heart of a man whose prose I had read and long admired, someone who had survived a similar experience. Price is, hands down, my favorite writer."
4,Eye opening,"Should be mandatory reading of all Medical Students and Residents. Disease process as seen and documentd by a patient. The physical, emotional, and spiritual swings a patient goes through during a long protracted illness."
3,Faith's review,I thought the book was well written but thought there would be much more helpful information for those of us just starting out in the wheelchair. I was a little let down by that.
5,Exceptional,"Esteban is a gifted musician, combined with an equally outstanding group of bandmates. Seeing him in concert is a magical night. These two cd's show the incredible talent he and his band has. When you have Jesse McQuire in his band for this concert, you know the trumpet and guitar are going to sound superb together. I live in Arizona and have seen him and met him dozens of times and he gets better every year. I would also highly recommend his DVD concert ""Esteban & Friends in Sedona"" with Eugene Fodor and Ronan Tynan."
5,Great quality live performance!,This is Esteban at his finest. He demonstrates his great feel and range on the guitar. A wonderful selection of music performed on the guitar by one of the world's best!
4,Tingling Face Cleanser,"I really like this product. The foam is a lot more pleasant to rub onto my face than straight soap and doesn't feel greasy at all like some cleansers. It does a good job cleaning (I especially like the ""cooling effect"" probably from the witchhazel in this product) and hasn't caused over-dryness for my skin type."
3,moonshine the life in pursuit of white liquer,"this was a preety good book. It is about this guy named Garland Bunting, who has been engaged in caturing and prosacuting men and weomen. To do so he has droven taxi cabs and whatever else you can think of, to get these people to stop selling elligal liquer.he has learned several tips from huntes, they told him that coons can find a illigal monnshine bussnues any day of the week, so from that day on he decided to start raising coon dog's, so that he could catch the scum of the earth (as so he says) who are selling this illigal liquer. This man is 57 years of age and he is of a medium hieght, he has been doing this type of stuff for over 30 years. In north corolina it is illigal to sell liquer on sunday's so the people who are acaholics are always out looking for liquer on sunday's, and that is whern garland is out busting peoepl most of the time. I would recomend this book to any body that is all I have for know thank you for reading my review."
3,HELLO! Anybody there?,"i bought this because i loved all the other diablo books, but when i recieved it, i found it to be nothing more than a comic strip, that is 64 pages, it is a comic book, like superman or batman, no where in the description does it say what kind of book it is, it says paperback, i have not read it yet, but i have looked at it, the book is pictures with bubbles filled with about 20 words a page, probably less for most pages"
5,"A ""must have"" for any budding entrepreneur!","Peter Biehler has written not only a sensational book about infomercials, he has unwittingly written an entertaining and profound book on motivation and persevering to attain one's goals. He provides an indepth understanding of the key components of how to put together an infomerical and succeed. It was more like reading an engrossing novel than the uusal dreary business books."
3,Good but outdated,This is a good book on the infomercial industry but a little too old and outdated for 2010.
1,Thighmaster craze?? Its called luck.,"Great opinion on this craze. Could have been summedup in four words: Right place, Right time.The only way money was made here was preying on those peoplewho have nothing better to do than watch late night infomercials and dream of ways to turn around their pathetic lives. You should be ashamed of yourselves, trying to make more money because of these people by offering this tripe.Shame,shame, shame. I can't wait to see you're next book,I Can't Believe They Bought It!!!!!"
2,Disturbing treatment of domestic violence,"Was anyone else bothered by the hero's use of his fists on his wife? And the dismissal of it as being ""temper"" and forgiveness coming quickly and easily?This really bothered me and took away from the book."
3,"Interesting, could be better, violence","In the first part of this book, the heroine acts in an illogical manner. Surprisingly for someone who is a feminist, she allows herself to be taken advantage of. I kept waiting for her to show some spine.However, the last part of the book is amusing and entertaining and much more believable.I also marked it down because the hero hits the heroine. There's no way I find that acceptable, or believe that in real life it would be a once only event.This is the first book of Beverley's that I've read. I plan to avoid any others, since I suspect (partly confirmed by warnings on her website), that the leading characters suffer a degree of violence that has no place in novels I read for escapism.Too bad - she has the makings of a good author in this genre."
2,The heroine changes midway through the book.,"Beth, the headstrong feminist heroine, is incredibly likable in the beginning of this book. She's witty, she's strong, she's unimpressed with Lucien (who is entirely too impressed with himself) and she's independent. After they marry, she becomes co-dependent to the degree that after he hits her, she covers up for him! Lies to his parents, etc. THEN, as if that were not strange enough, she asks him to take her to meet his mistress. Does that seem like it's in character? That Beth would be comforting HIM after he hits her (and taking the blame), and that after a scene like that, she'd want anything to do with him? But wait, there's more to stretch your credulity! After that slap, Beth wants to meet Lucien's mistress, and they become friends, of course! Can we have romance heroines who have a little self-respect back? Thanks."
4,Unexpected Pleasure,"I picked up this book with relatively low expectations. And was thoroughly surprised. I have enjoyed Jo Beverley's writings in the past so that wasn't the surprise, but the description on that back doesn't really give you a sense of the depth of emotion and feeling you will get from both characters. It's funny, entertaining and, unusually intelligent."
5,The best historical romance I've ever read,"This one has it all--humour, adventure, intrigue, glitz and glam, and, of course, romance. The very best (IMO) of the author's excellent Company of Rogues series--though CHRISTMAS ANGEL and FORBID DEN come close seconds--and the very best histori cal romance I've ever read. This tale of a fiesty bluestocking who is forced to marry a rather arro gant young blueblood shows how far the romance genre has evolved. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, so suffice it to say that this ""shrew"" doesn't get tamed! The sympathetic por trayal of the hero's ex-mistress is an added bo nus.But when will the rest of the series appear?! There hasn't been a new Company of Rogues book for three years!"
4,Even better the second time around,"Okay, the slap was a little too much, but it doesn't change the fact that this is still a very good story. What's more is that the love that develops between the characters is actually believable. As far as the slap goes, it was unneccesary to push the plot forward. However, this is a fast and highly entertaining read. I would recommend that you read it and form your own opinion."
2,Head strong heroine goes nowhere,"I did not like it. Not bad enough to put down before the end, hoping it will turn out interesting but.... She doesn t want the marriage forced on her and she'll do/say anything to prevent it. When she realises she will be married anyways, she does not have the wit to arrange things for the story to become an interesting relationship. From there, it goes flat. They turn in circle until, it seams, the author realised the story's boring, then, she (the author) digs out an old bad guy from previous story to make something happend... She event dig out old heros to manage it all. It's as if the not interesting story was lacking text to fill out the contract the author had and she improvise a speudo exiting end to it..."
1,Domestic Violence is NOT romance,"I cannot for the life of me figure out the other reviews on this book.In short, the ""hero"" here physically abuses the ""heroine"" and she gives the traditional victim lies that she fell to cover the fact that she has a gigantic bruise on her face. He twists her arm and causes her pain and is constantly threatening to beat her up and it's not in a joking manner (not that it is funny anyway).When I read ""he backhanded her.."" I nearly fell out of my chair. THIS is a ""romance?"" The heroine very quickly forgives him, he quickly forgets that he's hit her and the whole book made me so ill, I threw it away.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but most assuredly not to anyone seeking to read a romance. This isn't romance. This is domestic violence. The last two chapters made me sick and the character does such an about face about her ""modesty"" or whatever that I just couldn't bear to finish this book.The worst ""romance"" I have ever read, hands down."
3,ZZZZZZ,"Ok I love Jo Beverly books! And I give this one 3 stars for the story writing/plot in general, but I love a hard core romance and this one well I just had to take long breaks in betwwen chapters because it got so slow!!! Now if your someone who dosn't mind waiting for the 21st chapter just to FINALLY read about the couple making love then you might like this but the fact that I had to get thru like 400 out of 462 pages or whatever just to see this happen was distressing. And then when I FINALLY made it there nuthing! he holds her then its over you get no detail about it at all. AHHHHH....Anyway at least it had a story to it. It just draged on and on and on well you get the point. It just felt like more of a Hmmm..regular book than a historical romance or any romance!"
5,Beautifully Simple!,"This bench sits great, it's beautiful, and very easy to put together! My wife and I were able to put this together in about 15 minutes."
2,Missing Hardward,"My bench was delivered without much of the hardware, which made it impossible to put together. While the customer service department was very nice, they repeatedly sent me the wrong pieces. After 5 or 6 times, they finally sent me A BRAND NEW BENCH for free...with NO HARDWARE!!!The quality is ok...nothing great."
2,NOT THE BENCH-THE SERVICE,"Other reviews state that the packaging could be better, that is an under statement. Mine arrived Christmas Eve with the wooden parts broken and scratched. I still have not received the replacement. So much for a Christmas present."
4,Astonica 50102314 Bench,"This is a well built and ez to put together ""park"" bench.It has a heavy coating and is solid wood and steel.DO NOT confuse it with the cheapos you will find at Rite Aid and food stores. This bench has better formed wood and a heavy coating, the other cheap type is untreated and tends to come out of the box warped.It is worth the difference!"
1,WARNING: not a good idea to order this,"I ordered this a week ago, it arrived today, the wood is damaged and it is missing essential hardware. I was instructed by the UPS person delivering this to me to immediately notify Amazon.com and UPS. I have notified each, and have been informed that this will be rectified somehow, not really informed eactly how it will be rectified. I suspect this is the fault of the manufacturer. Anyhow, I would warn you it is best not to order this item if this is how the manufacturer delivers it's product."
4,A GREAT BENCH,"WHEN I SAW THIS BENCH I SAID TO MY SELF ""WOW WHAT A GREAT BENCH""THIS WOULD GO GREAT IN MY BACK YARD."
2,Missing Items,"Despite several calls to the 1-800 Number listed on the Manufacturers box, the customer service representative would never return my calls for help. The item arrived without the instructions and the obvious back support for the back part of the bench which is clearly shown on every picture Amazon offers. A lack on instructions would normally not be such a big thing but the placement of the narrow slats is important for the spacing to fit properly. Amazon has responded that they will help with this company but nothing has occured as yet."
1,broken,I ordered one of the classic benches and when it arrived the box was all torn apart and it had a broken leg and no bolts to put it together. This is not an easy item to ship UPS. I had to pack it up again and ship it back to Amazon (at amazon's cost).
5,take time and smell the roses,"I have been looking, for at least, two summers for the perfect bench to put out front of our house. I am a rose lover, and when I read the description, I knew that it was the one that I was searching for. [...]. Like a excited kid during Christmas or a birthday party,I ripped open the package, ASAP!! What a pleasant surprise! With not having a picture to go buy, I had to get a picture in my head. The ""Rose Bench"" was more beautiful than I picture and the craftsmanship was extrodinary. Instuctions were simple to follow.Within fifteen minutes, I had the new bench that I have been unable to find for several years.[....]"
1,Piece of garbage!,Don't buy it. It was damaged when it arrived. Packing was all torn and busted up. The back wood on the bench was cracked and broken. One of the bench seat boards was missing. The bolts are cheap and snapped off when tightened. Buy at your own risk.
1,Don't buy this!!! You will taken for a ride and regret it.,[How bad]! It was sent in a box that was clearly not design for this bench. The box wasn't even sealed. The pieces were badly scratched and the screws/bolts were missing...
3,grapevine garden bench,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She opened the box, and top and bottom piece of wood has big gouges in it. We are trying to contact the company to get replacement pieces. Free shipping was great. But tried to order myself one also but item was listed as unavailable, now after free shipping expires they have them again, which isn't right. Glad I didn't get one though if they come in damanaged like it did."
4,Teacher & Engineer,"I would recommend a student in the all engineering fields to read this book. It provide the tone of the engineering professionals. The material in some parts may seem to be out of date, but the major portions are still interesting."
5,duncraft tube feeder,"This Duncraft tube feeder that i purchased, #1. arrived very quickly! #2. The price was VERY reasonable, especially since the price of tube feeders {other well known brands} has gone off the charts.Its is well made, of metal, and a strong plastic tube. Easy to mount, with the base designed with screw holes for mounting to a post, or if desired, can also be mounted on a pole.It also has a button that can be removed, to clean out the feeder. All, in all, it is a very good feeder, with a great price, well made, and durable."
2,Heavy!,"These dishes are way too heavy. More like stoneware than the Corelle I had expected. May be my fault, since the description does say Vitreous Glass, yet I still expected something much lighter than was received. Postage to return was high."
3,Corelle Radiance Ulta Dish Set Review,"I read all the reviews of this lovely set before using my birthday gift certificate to purchase them. The other reviews were entirely accurate.a)Yellow color not a rich as in picture, more light, lemon colorb)Ultra is much heavier than traditional Corellec)Printing is off on some of the piecesHaving said that, I still enjoy them and they are very pretty and I am not sorry I took the chance. I wish Corelle would do a better job of quality control on the printing but I think they are pretty enough and inexpensive enough for me not to be too peeved."
3,Beautiful But...,"Beautiful pattern, nice heavy plates, didn't care for the style of coffee cup (not to mention the pattern has a totally different look on the cups). However, after using it a few times we discovered some flaws with the patten, some of the berries are black and look more like olives. The worst part is we would like to buy more plates and bowls but you can't find them. I wonder if the pattern is even available."
4,Love the pattern,I purchased this item as a gift for a daughter-in-law who is designing their kitchen in a Tuscan theme. Her favorite color is yellow. The dishes are sunny and cheerful and the pasta/soup/salad bowl are just the right size.For Corelle this set has a quality weight and feel...my only wish is that the mugs had been of the same material as the rest of the set. I would buy them again.
4,Huzzard recollects in Coberly,"In Huzzard's debut collection he soars through with poetry that not only warms the heart but also stirs the soul. He holds nothing back, and shows that he has great strength where not only so many authours lack but men as well. His non-fear of emotions radiates from the written word. His use of imagery and structure takes you from one level to another. This young man is an unseen Zen Master of the mind. Look for him in years to come, as I am sure the Coberly is not that last journey he will take you on."
1,Don't do it!,"Be careful here....these songs are not performed by the original artists. My wife was thrilled to find this compilation, only to open it and find out it's more like a ""Kidz Bop"" CD! Look elsewhere if you want a 70's CD - you're probably better off with a Time Life compilation than this misleading set."
5,Bergdorff luxuriousness at a Walmart price...,"I forgot about this product for a long time. I used it when I was younger. I recently found it in the stores again and I truly appreciate this formula. It's super moisturizing and makes your skin velvety soft. I liken it to Kiehls Creme de Corps (which i also love but costs about $50 more). Despite the cheap packaging, it's luxurious and works on even the driest skin."
5,Beautiful music!,"I was amazed by the songs, the delivery and the total effect of the album. The songs are absolutely wonderful, with poignant references to the political situation in Angola, his homeland. If you speak Portuguese, the effect is amazing. If you do not, the sounds will take you there, to the all-understanding level that only music can provide!"
3,This music has mystical powers!,"I was not disappointed by this CD. I love the gaiter playing on this. I only wished he had more slow songs like song #1. I don't understand a word of what he says, but I feel his Vibe!"
4,A literary genius,Hegel's knowledge of seventeenth century China is exhaustive. This book is a must-read for those interested in the 17th-century Chinese novel. I knew nothing of Chinese literature prior to reading Hegel's work but it fascinated me to the extent that I am now seeking a Chinese minor. Give it a go.
1,disappointing title--this is not a book of IQ tests...,"I bought several books labeled as ""IQ testing"" books and, sadly, none of them were. They all required ""prior knowledge"" (like geographical locations or math formulas, etc), none of which should be on a ""standardized"" IQ test. Basically, this is a ""Big Book of Brain Teasers"". I'll be sending it back to Amazon."
1,Creative Labs,"I got this product several months ago because Creative Labs CLAIMED on the BOX that this DVD works on Windows 2000 machines. Turns out they were lying, the only driver available for the DVD was a Beta-tested driver that STILL DID NOT run.They also said to continually check out their website for driver updates. It's been six months since my purchase and they never came out with a suitable driver for Windows 2000 machines.Now I'll be giving this DVD player to one of my relatives to run on their older Windows processors while I do some heavy research for a DVD that will actually run on Win2000.BUYER BEWARE, just because it says Creative Labs doesn't always mean high quality."
1,"It worked great, at first.","First off let me just say that I purchased this drive when DVD-Roms were very popular and it was uncommon to see a computer come with one stock. Knowing that, it was really a heafty price (about 100 dollars). This product worked great for about two months before it broke; in that it, would not notice any type of cd I put into it. So I thought hummmmm, it must be still under warranty because I bought it only a few months ago. I send it into Creative Labs for repare and I get a call about two weeks later informing me that they want 90 dollars (plus the shipping cost) to repare it and send it back. I was furious, and didnt even bother to return their phone calls. Do not waist your money on this product. It breaks easy and can't even read most video disks that any other DVD player would have no problem with (ie VCD)"
2,"Sorry, no standing 'ovation' for this drive","This is a really bad DVD drive. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. But most of the time it didn't. While watching DVD's, it paused sporatically for up to 10 seconds. Sometimes it did not even play at all. It was fine with data and music CD's. I was expecting a good drive, keeping in mind Creative Labs' reputation. Boy, was I wrong.After awhile, it completely broke down on me, not recognizing any media whatsoever in the drive.Do yourself a favor and go with Sony or Memorex; their drives seem to be alright."
1,No Windows 2000 or XP drivers!,Read the other review that said there were no drivers for Windows 2000 and went to Creative site to verify. Indeed there are no Windows 2000 or XP drivers! For shame Creative!
3,Ovation 12x is indeed hit and miss,"I have had lots of problems with this thing. It is excellent for DVD and thats about it. About 3/4 the time when you put a cd, or cdr in it it reads it and spits it back at you. You gotta put it back in several times before it finally takes it. I called Creative and they sent me another one. Low and behold it has the same problem. Whats up with that? I dont know what the big stink about 2000 and XP drivers is. The thing works the same way for me in 2000 and 98."
1,no Windows 2000 or XP drivers,Read the other review that said there were no drivers for Windows 2000 and went to Creative site to verify. Indeed there are no Windows 2000 or XP drivers! For shame Creative!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE!,"This drive has been nothing but headache... I would give this drive ZERO star if I can. It played fine for a month and then it started having problems. Initially it refused to read DVDs then after about another month, it stopped reading CDs. Paid $100 for Creative Labs name, but I'll avoid buying their product again... maybe Soundcards, but nothing else."
1,Terrible purchase,"It seems like a lie but until now Creative doesn't have created any equipment support for this model. In Windows 2k as in 98 when I open the tray....it opens but in a few seconds it closesalone.....incredible. Absurditly it does not even have a pattern of time to close, so you need to pray for, when you put or take the cd..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!,"The quality of the video is good when it works! The key is when it works. Not only do they have no driver support but the computer won't even recognize the player. This drive has been out less than a year and they stopped supporting it. The software that comes with is useless except InterVideo WinDVD. The drivers that came with the DVD, the computer won't even recognize the floppy disk. I know at this point you are wondering about the validity of my computer. I am A++ certified and I built this computer myself and this DVD drive that doesn't work. Oh, it use to work off and on for about a month. When you contact the manufacturer they told me that normal IDE CD-ROM drivers that comes with WIN98 will work. Crock!!! Please save yourself from any pain. I bought this drive because of the Creative Labs name needless to say I will never buy they're products again."
1,Extremely shallow coverage of a complex topic,"I have been teaching a community education course in Visual Basic 6.0 for several years. With the advent of VB.NET, I began searching for a book that could be used to teach it. The requirements are that it be in a laboratory format, start at a low level and be fairly thorough in coverage.Unfortunately, this book is nowhere close to meeting those requirements. While it is structured as a series of exercises, the coverage is far too shallow to be used in anything but the shortest of courses. Very few of the exercises get beyond the simplest of structures and there is very little demonstration of how subroutines interact. The exercises generally consist of a simple program where the user is to insert very small segments to make it functional.We have been using the Shelley and Cashman book for the VB 6.0 course and this book barely covers half of what is covered in the that book. I have recommended that this book be dropped from adoption consideration."
4,Hawking and Black Holes,"""Hawking and Black Holes"" is one title in the ""Big Idea"" series, by the British writer/philosopher Paul Strathern. All of the titles in this series have been of interest to me, and some of them have also been professionally useful because I am a science teacher. I can also recommend a book by Strathern which is not in the Big Idea series; it is called ""Mendeleev's Dream"", and concerns the creation of the Periodic Table."
3,Why not?,"Worth checking out, mostly for the excerpt from Apsley Cherry-Garard's ""The Worst Journey in the World."" So creepy!"
5,"Excellent, secure, but needs practice","The holster is high quality leather and functions flawlessly. The weapon is secured with a satisfying ""click"" to let you know it is secured. The retention is excellent, but the draw is a litle awkward without practice. It is not similar to the draw of the Safariland SSIII holster at all, so if you're hoping to get an off duty/plainclothes holster to match the draw of that duty weapon holster, it does not do that. You will need muscle memory practice, but it doesn't take long."
3,"3 stars, should have been 10","I have this CD and enjoy it but can only give it 3 Stars because of 2 tracks that ruin the entire work completely. I read in Review that Track 5 is an experiment? What a disappointment, and such a blight for a promising release that simply stops in the middle of the CD with dead air that has me racing for the Forward button to avoid this pointless creative gap. Second is the awfully annoying and highly unnecessary addition of the beat track on the album closer. Why was it necessary to add this distracion when keeping it off this very beautiful, georgeous and haunting track off would have improved it 1000%? I don't often question Artist choices like this, but would foresight have made this a much more enjoyable CD in it's entirety to listen to?"
1,Music?,Is this album really music? It has basically no tune or beat to it. If you like the sound of computers or robots you might like this but this is not for people who like melodies and beats in their music.
3,"Small, cursory, but a nice addendum to stuffy books","Just a word of warning: you can breeze through this book in 15 minutes. It's *very* small, and half of the book is pictures. Also, given the rapidly changing face of Vegas nightlife, it's going to get out of date quite quickly (not to mention omissions). Still, it's an okay little guide that might point out 1 or 2 lounges or afterhours clubs you didn't know about. Still, I would not suggest this as your only guide to nightlife or dining in Vegas. I would definetly suggest pairing this with another book, or even better, going with someone 'in the know'."
1,Waste of time,"I gave 'Once A Thief' 2 stars on the hope that the second book would make it all worthwhile. It wasn't...This book is a yawn from start to finish with inept people doing predictable, stupid things. A major factor in my annoyance is the fact that these books were sold as two books: Wasted a year waiting for the wrap-up of a sub-par story and wasted $22 instead of $11, (what's with the super big print? is more pages a way to make us feel justified in spending so much money?)"
1,Don't waste your time.,"In a continuing story from ONCE A THEIF, this book focuses on a cat burglar named Quinn. It is a big help to read the first book because the author jumps right into the story and the characters aren't introduced at all. Basically, the plot revolves around a cat burglar helping Interpol catch another cat burglar. Believe me, it is very basic. There is really nothing here to sustain a whole book. It's a very long drawn out process and not very exciting. The book reads more like the romance novel it once was. I can't believe romance readers would be very happy either in this diluted version. Annoyances abound like when an archeologist with a supposedly high IQ says she doesn't know what sackcloth is. Totally unbelievable as was so much of this book. Overall, it was a waste of time. Skip it and read something better."
2,Agree with Disappointing Reviews,"It has become an unfortunate trend among more and more authors (mostly those who began as strictly romance writers) to resurrect earlier works, beef them up and then sell them like new works. Case in point are Once a Thief and Always a Thief. I was able to get through Once a Thief, but had enough by the time I started reading Always a Thief and ended up skimming the last 3/4's of the book. Don't bother with either one."
2,tune in tomorrow . . .,"Credibility goes out the window right from Chapter One as major characters converge on cue to jump-start the plot-- you can almost hear the mechanical plot snapping together like Lego blocks in the first few pages. Cliches infect the writing like the Black Plague sweeping through Europe. This one is for the soap opera crowd; all others, beware."
5,Kay Hooper-Always A Thief Book,Hooper is a great author. I love her books. Why do I have to make such a long review when less is just as good.
4,"In Always a Thief, Kay Hooper is Always a winner!","I read Once a Thief a few years ago and as a romantic fan of a 'happy ending' I was a bit disappointed. But as an author, I know the value of a good cliffhanger ending to capture readers and hook them on a series. Kay Hooper has done this in her sequel Always a Thief.The sparks flew in the first novel between Morgan West, a museum show director and the notorious cat burglar Quinn. Now they're back. When Quinn shows up at her apartment, injured and needing her assistance, what's a girl to do? Especially when an extremely mysterious and devastatingly charming man passes out in her arms.With more twists and turns than a rat's maze, Always a Thief is a combination of witty humor, high stakes action and sizzling romance. Without the complications of too many characters, this Hooper novel has characters that are 3-dimensional, delving into their motives and emotions. How about a `Forever a Thief', Kay?~ Cheryl Kaye TardifAuthor of Divine Intervention"
2,Don't bother with this one,"As with its prequel ""Once A Thief"" this book doesn't know if it is a romance or a mystery. In the end, it is neither. While the character of Quinn is fun, the supporting cast is flimsy and unbelievable and what you might call a plot is a complete joke.As in most romances (which this book originally was - see the author's introduction) the characters are all gorgeous, smart, rich, and incredibly talented. They fall into each other's arms after many pages of stifled emotion and terrible diaologe and ocassionally address the ""mystery"" at hand.This two book series could have been interesting with the character of Quinn, but instead it is irritating and boring. Spare yourself and look elsewhere."
1,Always a Thief,"First peeve -- when you write a book that seems to rely very heavily on the first the 2nd should not take a whole year to come out. Once a thief was really quite dull & I had forgotten the entire plot. 2nd peeve -- this book was so boring that I could not get through half of it & quit with disgust.I have read Kay Hooper's books & have enjoy her evil series & shadow series. This is ""dud"" series that shouldnot be continued."
2,Re-read the old series.,"A very valuable collection is going to be displayed. A world famous cat burglar (Quinn) is now in town and showing interest in the show's director, Morgan West. But we learn that Quinn is trying to stop another burglar/murderer from stealing the collection. Lots of twists and turns.Ms Hooper has not fleshed out the other caracters so you may get confused as to relationships, and in this book that is important.I perfered the ending to the original much better because it did end. Ms Hooper left an opening for a sequel with this re write.If you like suspense with weak paranormal, this one is ok. But if you like romanace, stick with the old series."
2,Shallow mystery novel by Kay Hooper,"In Always A Thief, internationally renown jewelry thief Quinn is ""encouraged"" by Interpol to catch another thief, Nightshade, who has no qualms about murdering those in his/her way. Museum employee Morgan falls in love with Quinn, but Nightshade knows this as well, and Quinn knows Nightshade has this information. Who will catch who?Author Kay Hooper tries to please readers of two genres with this book: those who read mysteries, and those who read romance novels. Sadly, I think both categories of readers will be disappointed. The mystery is convoluted but shallow, with the ""who-dunit"" plot seeming forced. You'll really learn nothing of Nightshade or Quinn, but you will learn about Morgan's flirtation with and romance for Quinn.Shallow characters. Shallow plot. This is a book that I finished because it was easy to follow and I really expected something to happen eventually.It didn't. The end. Whew!"
4,Thief storyline started in Once is finished in Always,"This book can be read independent of Once a Thief; however, if you have read Once a Thief and were left disappointed, you must read Always a Thief. I found Always a Thief has satisfying wrap-up of the storyline started in Once a Thief. There is a bit of a cliffhanger at the end and an amply number of twists and turns throughout the novel. I would definitely enjoy a third Thief book should Ms. Hooper chose to continue this line of characters."
5,"""Anything but boring!""",As I said before I am a huge fan of Lay Hooper! I love all of her books. I think Always a Thief is anything but boring! Try it and judge for yourself! It is a terrific story!
4,Needs 2 to collapse it.,"I've had a lot of fun with this item, but you need to be careful lighting it so that there is even lighting over its entire surface. Because it is folded, it does develop wrinkles, which can easily be steamed out quickly. The major drawback is that it requires 2 people to collapse it back into its smaller size."
3,Product is OK,"I just find a little bit brilliant, what's not quite good for a chroma screen, but it works well with appropiate lighting."
4,Fun Game,This is a fun game and much better after I found a walk-through on the internet. There are a lot of hidden features that you'd never know about unless someone told you.
4,so-so,"It's a really fun game with good graphics and levels, but in the end, there isnt anything to do. All you can do is open up a new folder and start over. But that itself isn't too bad. I would normally rate it five stars, but I like really hard games so I would say that if you like games that are easy but then challenging, this is the game for you."
2,Rather boring,"Pretty boring and way to easy. Im not even much of a video game player. The graphics were ok. Garfield is slow and akward to move, which i guess makes sense with Garfield. Good game for kids who have liitle or no experience with video games. There is no blood or violence, very safe for young eyes."
1,Still Waiting for Refund,This shirt was too small and I am still waiting on a refund from the company
4,Rancid Rocks,"This CD is great, although the comparison w/Green Day sucks. (bc. Green Day sucks) Rancid has some great songs on here, and you get way more than you paid for."
5,This is one of the/the great records of the 90s.,"This album, unarguably, is a total killer, bristling with quality, accessible and melodic songs that all actually mean something and that are all delivered with total commitment, attack and panache. This album proves Rancid has got a headlock on true understanding of the dynamic tension that ticks at the heart of all truly great rock music. It is a screaming roaring ass-kicking foot-tapping heart-lifting piece of pure rock'n'roll excellence. For me there is absolutely no question that this is one of the great albums of the decade."
4,rancid ruleS,Check it out. If you like ruby soho check out junkyman maxwell murder time bomb and the rest
2,this is a peice of punk rock history,"or so says the management at epitaph, rancids record label. i rather think that this album, while it does have its moments, avenues and allyways, anyone, takes a back seat to the sex pistols, the clash, and even the work of another east bay band, operation ivy, sho at least addressed the issues that are plagueing modern america. in any case, you have to respect them for being one of the only bands still wearing mohawks."
4,this really isn't a review just a thought,"I started reading some of these reviews and the whole ""rip-off""/""wannabe"" clash thing came up a lot. Yes this record in particular does have a lot of clash influence. but than again were SLF heavily influenced by the clash as well? and weren't the clash influenced by the ramones? then again who wasn't?"
2,. . . and out comes the truth,"These punks really wear their Clash influence on their sleeves. It's not a bad influence to have; hard-core and ska are worthy genres as well. Rancid do it with conviction and do it well, particularly the bass player.The main problem is I hardly ever make it through this entire CD. There's almost no point because the songs sound so much alike. I can understand people going crazy for this music (at least for a little while), but Rancid's style and songwriting powers, at least on this album, are pretty limited."
2,"Could I have some cliches with my punk, please?","They may have a good message, but they sound just like the Clash. Scratch that: the Clash were innovators, changing their musical style as they grew and developed. Rancid has sounded the same since its inception, deviating little, if at all, from the punk-ska formula. Replete with fake British accents and a cover with a photo of boots on it, it's all a cliché. If you like punk cliches, and you don't mind hearing the same song 19 times, then this is the album for you. If you like cookie-cutter punk that doesn't stray one inch from the formula, then this is for you. If you don't want your musical expectations challenged, it's definitely for you. Yes, it's fun. But that's it: just some fun with a good message and a lot of trappings. If this is the best punk can offer, than it really must be dead. So, rock out with this if you must, but maybe you'd be better off with some AC/DC or something else just as generic and dull."
5,A True Punk Album,"First, I want it known I am not a fan of the Epitaph roster. I find it to be full of poseur bands and I hate NOFX, but I'll give props when it is due. Rancid are a great punk pop band the way the Descendents are. Tim Armstrong writes perfect songs that owe as much to the Clash as the Subhumans. And his ska songs are some of the best in the genre. But make no mistake, Rancid definitely have a sound of their own, and they prove it on this album."
5,THey've done it know!,"THis is my favorite rancid cd. On the first song ""maxwell Murder"" there is the sickest bass solo that I have ever Heard. It is great for punk/ska and hardcore fans. When I first baught this cd I listened to it ten times in a row<br />And kept it in my cd player for a whole month, Im dead serious. Rancid is good for fans of the clash, reel big fish, mighty mighty bostones, G.B.H.,AFI,THe Casualties, Greenday,and dead kennedys"
5,Best Rancid albulm I own,"I don't listen to as much punk as I used to, but this albulm is still one of my all time favorites. I believe it is their best. The songs on it have good beats and are catchy. Maybe that is why some ""hard core punks"" don't like it as much, it isn't all thrash and screaming. I believe this cd shows so much of thier talent. I totally recommend it."
4,RANCID vs BLITZ,Sure this is a great album by a great band. But i have to say that this cannot be rated as highly as BLITZ and their VOICE OF A GENERATION album. I have a copy of RANCID doing a cover of 'someones gonna die'. Rancid fans should check out the origional BLITZ version.
3,"Fun, but ultimately nothing.","There are some great, catchy, anthemic songs on here. Beyond that, there just isn't anything of merit. It's not just that Rancid has been done in the past (better), or that their songs are disposable, or that any real punk fan has moved on to purer, better, older things, or that they come off more as poseurs than anything else, or that this album is overcrowded with the same songs, or even that the hype surrounding this band is hazy and overpowering. It's all of those things put together. Rancid just can't live up. They've got a great punk band name though."
5,...And out come the great songs,"This is the first Rancid CD that I bought and listened to, and let me tell everyone that is a fan of punk rock... if you don't know already this is a GREAT CD. With great riffs and thoughtful lyrics by Lars and Tim, the band really steps to new heights. Buy this."
3,Rancid is pretty good,"Best Rancid CD out there. Not the best CD out there, but entertaining enough. As Wicked and Ruby Soho are best songs."
4,Would've been 3 if it wasn't rancid,"I give this CD 3.5 stars. I didn't know whether to put 3 or 4, but seeing as it was my beloved Rancid, I decided on 4. I love Rancid, and I love all of their albums, except this one, which I just LIKE. Don't get me wrong . . . I have played this album repeatedly since I got it, but there are a few songs I always skip (particularly the HORRIBLE Maxwell Murder, which doesn't even sound like Rancid), whereas with the other albums, there is not a single bad track. The album in general though, is good - quite fast paced, REAL punk, with some good ska thrown in too. As Wicked, The War's End, and Roots Radicals are probably the best tracks. I can also appreciate Ruby Soho, although it sounds a little bit more commercial (but not poppy) than the usual Rancid. So, you should buy Out Come The Wolves, but buy Rancid's other albums first."
1,BAD PUNK,"Rancid sounds like 80's punk. Rancid is a terrible band. The punk bands today like lagwagon, green day, and nofx are so much better than rancid. This cd is like someone just screaming for no reason at all. Rancid needs a haircut because those mohawks are just sooooooo old!!!!!!!!! If you want a real punk band, and a punk cd, get lagwagon's double plaidinum."
5,All hail.,"What is left to say about this ablum, that hasn't been said. ....And out come the wolves is one of the best punk albums out there and is the best punk album of the 90's. If this doesn't convience you to at-least check this album out, I don't know what will."
5,Just wanted to say something,"I love Rancid and all their an awesome band but stop bashing bands like Blink-182 and Good Charlotte. Just because their more pop isn't a bad thing, hell The Ramones/The Sex Pistols and The Clash were very poppy as well. Anyways, Rancid rules and my cousin is friends with Tim."
2,weak,"I fell in love with one of these songs at a listening-station in a record store, and bought the album. But my affection for the music didn't last past the first couple listens. This music has no endurance at all. When Johnny Rotten said one of the reasons he reunited with the Sex Pistols for their ""Filthy Lucre"" tour, was because, ""so-called punk bands like Rancid are so terrible, I want to show people how punk is done right,"" I knew what he meant."
2,Why Rancid?,"Rancid is just another punk band. It blows. If you dis-agree you obviously haven't heard very much music. There's nothing wrong with punk rock, but listen to it because of the music, not to be considered ""punk"" because that's just lame. However if you like Rancid, or you think you do.... try listening to Operation Ivy, The vocalist and drummer from Rancid are both in this ausom band. The truth is that Rancid is a fashion thing, and all that listen to it should seriously consider some good punk rock, like Operation Ivy, Or Ramones."
1,Its a crying shame....,"Overrated, craptastic, name dropper band. They stole Minor Threats CD cover too and added a mohawk(WTF?!)Plus the lead singer helped Pink out with her new album, so think about this before you go trying to call Rancid a great punk band, the early stuff was great the new stuff is not."
5,WHO LET DA WOLVES OUT?!,"Passionate gutter poetry. Rancid was still hungry on this joint. It doesn't get better unless you take advantage of the BETTER TOGETHER deal offered by Amazon and by this along with ""Let's Go"". These two sessions mark Rancid at their tightest."
5,Ska at its best!!!,...And Out Come The Wolves is a great set of songs.Rancid never got the attention they deserved. But this is great music!
5,Must-Have Libertines Single,"The Libertines probably set a record for releasing the most singles containing the fewest title tracks of any band in rock history. There are at least four different disks containing ""Don't Look Back Into the Sun,"" and three featuring ""Can't Stand me Now.""Most of them are good. Don't miss this one. ""Dilly Boy"" is a romp, well worth the couple of bucks this disk will cost you. And I can never hear the title track too many times.While you're at it, pick up the single/EP disk titled ""I Get Along,"" which features four other non-album tracks.Hopefully someone will compile all of the B-tracks from this incredible band -- there are enough to make up a great post-mortem album."
5,Great intro to Bad Relgion,"This is my first Bad Religion album and I love it. From what I can tell, this is a collection of a all of their best songs before 1995 on one album. It is so obvious Bad Religion have been one of the most influencial bands ever.There are 22 catchy songs on here. Lyrics are sung soooo well by Greg. They are mostly about evolution, man kind and politics. The gutarring is amazingly good. Bret Gurewtiz is a master at writing/playing solos. The drumming is fast and captures the feel very well.I guess the only weakness musically on this album, is that its a collection of old recorded songs. There is one song on here that was recorded 20 years ago. Its not exactly High-Fidelity Stereo compatible. You can barely hear lyrics on some of these songs (especially the live songs). However, it won't bother you after a while, and it doesn't take away too much of the experience."
5,one of the best,i would definitley give this cd all 5 stars for a number of reasons mainly cause bad religion rocks they have been my favorite band for along time and i suppose if yoru just getting into them this is the album to start of with it has alot of their best songs on it you can listen to this album over and over and still not get sick of it this album has been in my cd player for the last like 4 months! the lyrics are amazing if you just read them they have alot of meaning and are easy to relate to and they are incredibly talented..if you like bad religion this is a must have album
4,A worthwhile addition,"A good collection of Bad Religion's older material. A lot of it is more ""punkish"" than their later (and, in my opinion, better) material. Some pretty classic tracks but an equal number of not-so-great songs. I'd probably give it three stars if I weren't already such a BR fan. Worth getting in either case, though."
5,great punk,"This is really what punk rock is really all about. There is high energy, social commetary and of course plenty of shord songs with power chords. This is something you can listen to over and over again without getting tired because Bad Religion keeps a high energy feel. It's really a great album to buy for those not wanting to spend the money to get their old independent albums."
5,"If you like Bad Religion, you'll love this cd!","This has the best songs from most of the br cds. It has got everything you'd want in a cd. The best song on it is either atomic garden or agaist the grain. Well, buy it , it's good."
4,all ages is a fantastic resemblence of rebellion and pride,"All ages really opened me up to the world of rebelling against things that aren't right. Racism, curfews, and unjust laws are among these. Bad Religion is my escape into the world of ""I can do whatever I want and you cannot stop me""."
5,Great CD,if you dont own any BR stuff start with this. it has some of their best songs on one cd. buy this and then get suffer and no control. this is a great cd with awesome vocals and lyrics.
4,Entertainment that lasts for hours and hurs.,"I like games were I can build my cities my way, control everything, monopolize everything. If you are looking for hours of non stop fun you have to get this game. This game doesnt only challenges your ability to run a company smoothly but it makes you feel like youre the head of a major RR corporation. I srongly recommend this game."
3,Railroad Tycoon II,"Very involving strategy game, has a good tutorial to supplement it. But very hard and quite frustrating."
5,Great Game,This is a great game. The sound is good and so is the graphics. If you like RTC you will like this game. It is a hard game but it is fun. You can play the stock market. There are all kinds of trains. There are some cheat codes so you can get more money. I very highly recommend this game.
4,Entertainment that lasts for hours and hours.,"I like games were I can build my cities my way, control everything, monopolize everything. If you are looking for hours of non stop fun you have to get this game. This game doesnt only challenges your ability to run a company smoothly but it makes you feel like youre the head of a major RR corporation. I srongly recommend this game."
1,NOT A FUN GAME!,"After spending a few hours trying to decipher the mysteries of Railroad Tycoon II, I finally experienced enlightenment and realized I was NOT having fun. The game has many tempting possibilities of entertainment, but I found the game frustrating to play. The manual does not explain much; building stations and laying track are difficult and unforgiving tasks. I have not played the first version of the game, and this may explain my befuddlement.In short, I would not recommend this game. In fact if you really want this game, my trash pick up is on Thursday and this game will be in the can."
2,Dont get it,"This game is worth about 28 hours of good play than it realy gets boring. It isnt proportional eather if you play a scenario game and make a 6 car train, it would stretch from Millwalkie to Chicago. The graphics are very good and so is the sound but, thats the best part of the game. I give this game 2 stars."
1,Saying the truth!!,"I have never heard about this game, but one day, I saw it on a shelf, in a computer store. Iv'e read about it and it sounded really fun. It sounded really fun to build a train company, and to build train stations but when i really tried it, it was so hard, and it wasn't fun. It's hard to understand the investments thing and you are loosing all of your money in 5 minutes. I dont understand why is everybody saying that this game is good, cause this game is bad. VERY BAD! VERY, VERY BAD! Who can prove that i'm wrong? a couple of days after i bought i started to use cheats in the game because it is too hard. This game should get 0 starts, it should get nothing. So... Dont buy it because you'll just be waisting your money!!"
5,I recommend Railroad Tycoon II to anyone.,"Railroad Tycoon is an excellent strategy game. Players design a railroad from the ground up. Where should you locate tracks? What engines should you buy? And just as importantly, what cargo should you carry and where will it fetch the highest price? The railroad genre should appeal to many and it is a refreshing break from military strategy. The user interface is intuitive and the graphics are nice. The game play is real-time. AI opponents are fairly challenging."
1,Welcome to the FRAUD,"(...)This DvD is like the current GnR line up excluding you know who- NO PERSONALITY- If you buy this DvD after reading these ratings, you are not a Fan but a LOSER (...)PS. the one star was mandatory to publish my review.."
2,not that good,this documentary is not a help at all to all GN'R fans..though it gives some hi lights on Gn'R life..but it's only a little.. they don't even show the members of GNR..
1,es una burla,"quiero decir que quiero mi dinero de vuelta, su galeria de imagenes exclusivas son una porqueria, el documental nisiquiera es de guns, es de personas que no nos importa en lo mas minimo y no tuvieron la amabilidad de poner subtitulos.por eso les advierto que no regalen su dinero."
1,major disappointment,"This DVD doesn't even deserve one star. If there was a way to put a negative in front of this star I would.I'm a huge Guns N' Roses fan, and after watching the first five minutes of the DVD and seeing that interviews were being conducted with ditsy girls, and random people from the streets I suddenly realized that I had wasted my money.I had no idea that there wouldn't be any exclusive interviews or music from Guns N' Roses. In January I found out this DVD was coming out, and picked it up in April when it was finally released. I was excited because it was the first Guns N' Roses DVD ever.If I knew it was going to be that bad, as avid of a fan as I am, I would have never bought it. This DVD is just going to take up space on my DVD tower, never to be watched again. It was a major disappiontment."
1,Waste of time and money,"This DVD is completely awful. I'm a big Guns fan but I learned nothing new from this DVD. This DVD played like film student's first project before any real education. Most of the people interviewed in the story weren't really important players in GnR history (Axl's tattoo artist? Give me a break) and no real insight was gained. Some of the facts were screwed up and people were mentioning things off the top of their heads (""I think it was ...) when, if they were important in the evolution of the band, would have been able to state matter of factly..."
1,Not even worth 1 Star,"First of all the production quality of this DVD is horrible, everything from graphics, music, editing, etc. I made better quality videos in college when I studied Radio & TV...and I barley passed the TV part. No licensed music, horrible narrative and the people they interview are nobodys, some groupies and a guy who works for some indy mag. They have one GNR interview which is about 3rd generation quality tape.Stay away!!!"
1,Worst unofficial GNR product ever!,"I'm a huge GNR fan and this is the absolute worst rip off ever. There are NO original GNR music on this tape and VERY little interviews with any band members. Please, for the love of God, don't make the same mistake I made and buy this product! there are many better products to choose from such as the making of Estranged and Welcome to the Videos."
3,Commons,It's an ok book if you aren't a poet and don't mind everything being so depressing and repetitive
5,How did I miss this,"As a child of the sixties I cut my teeth on the British Blues bands. How did I miss miss these guys? Of course I'd heard ""Alright Now"", who hasn't? But I never looked past that small sample of this bands work. Obviously I'm no expert and I have not idea how this collection stands up to any other, but I can say I'm in love with what's on these two discs. Intense and more important, soulful, they were an amazing band. Better late than never."
1,not original at all,total chaos lyrically is not intelligent they are conformists they just conform to something different from other people
4,good!,"Fatal Fury is martial arts at its finest. Dramatic storyline, good dubbing, good soundtrack, and good fight scenes; what more is really necessary? The story can get kind of corny with Terry's ""bird in a guilded cage"" speech, and the story can definitely be called generic. Nonetheless, Fatal Fury is a worthy addition to one's anime collection, and essential to any fighting game fan."
3,Needs to be proofread.,"I read this book years ago and enjoyed re-reading it today. Keep in mind it was first published in 1985 so the ""romance"" is mild in comparison to romance books written today.I gave it 3 stars because it needs to be proofread. It looks like it was scanned and never ""cleaned up"". There are misspelled words and places where several sentences are mixed in together."
2,I didn't like this,"The review by ""C. Henderson"" is all you need to read to know all there is about this book. I learned about the Apache way of life & the bigotry against them. That is all I got out of this book. If it didn't have a good ending I would have given it a 1*. I felt so sorry for Hannah & what she went through, but reading the story was more like reading a history book than a romance novel."
3,It's good,"I like more bass than this puts out but it was less than $15, so I'm not complaining! It sounds good and fits well when I'm running. It gets a little uncomfortable to sit around the house and listen with though. But my ears are rather small so its hard to go by my review for the fit."
3,"Great sound, cheap materials","The sound in this headphones is great considering they came with a CD player; both bass and treble sounds terrific, also, they are quite confortable. Materials are not good enough. The same as other buyers, the ear loops on my headphones broke too (with normal use, they never received hard use), the foam that covers the ear pieces started to fall and after a while, I was using them with no foam at all."
5,Excellent resource for small home-based water power,"Harnessing Water Power For home Energy is an excellent resource for individuals who are interested in harnessing water power for their energy needs. This book deals with the various type of hydroelectric systems, from different types of waterfalls to water turbines. Detailed flow and output calculations are included for the more advanced reader. The book is written in plain language and contains a wealth of drawings and diagrams. Altogether, a must-have reference for anyone who is thinking of building or maintaining hydropower for their home and family."
4,"6mm balls, not 5mm","The item description says the ball size is 5mm, the one I received has 6mm balls, still a cute ring though."
5,Luscious!,"Telluride Truffles are the best truffles anywhere! You can have the pleasure and satisfaction of choosing your own selection, or wait for the delicious array they send you. The people at Telluride are cordial, helpful and understanding, too. Five stars."
1,"Product may be great, but sales is not particularly competent","Spent some time deliberating over mother's day gifts; reviews for this product are outstanding. However, this particular ad does not, at the time my order was placed, indicate need to bump up to ""special shipping"" in order to ship to southern states ($6 extra)I have no problem with needing special shipping, but you need to make it clear at the point of sale. I see now that on several of their other products, this is now clear, but was not the case when I placed this order.I've encouraged them to be a bit more clear in terms of their Amazon presence. Perhaps they will be."
4,unexpected,"I had no plans to read this book, or Robert Rankin for that matter. I happened to be on vacation, having finished all the fiction on my Kindle and saw this available on Amazon. Turns out Robert Rankin has the an absurd and funky mind, and quite a page turned for the ridiculous sounding plot. Quite a fun read in the end."
3,The Antipope,"Unfair judgement of this item!! After a month of waiting Amazon can't ship it or the Book of Ultimate Truth. US Rankin fans beware, this is not necessarily a proper outlet for order."
2,"Doesn't do anything, smells","Bought this product because it was supposed to relax you. Doesn't seem to do anything and the pills stink. Giving it 2 stars because I know some people that think it is great, so maybe it will work for you."
5,Great Little Book,"Very interesting theories about the intersection of ADHD and prisons. We tracked down most of the research quoted in the book and it seems to be solid. We brought the authors to Littleton, Colorado after reading the book to meet with the Greater Littleton Youth Initiative members. Patrick Hurley's 17 years experience as a law enforcement officer (and his experience with his own ADHD) combined with Bob Eme's research around the criminal justice system make for a very compelling duo. This is a quick read but has some deep insights into how ADHD kids are wired to go wrong if they don't get help."
2,The Mob rules but this game doesn't,"This game could have been really cool if they had stuck with the mob concept, but instead they leaned more toward the comedy aspect. First, you are forced to play the tutorial, before you can start playing the real game. But the tutorial doesn't show you how to play the game. In fact at a couple points they leave you hanging as to how to acomplish certain tasks. The instructions book is no help either. The graphics were fair, nothing to wright home about. I recommend sticking with StarCraft or Sim City 3000. However, if you are really into the whole mob thing you still might want to check out this game."
1,Want to be part of Mafia....?,"This game is really not worth it! It's what you call a failure! But if you are seeking to play a Mafia game, then try Gangsters 2! It's rated for the best 10."
2,Dont buy Mob Rule,"at first you think the game is going to be great,and it does seem interesting but after half an hour of gameplay,you get stuck ,and theres nothing new.the graphics are good but it's very confusing.Buying this is like throwing $20 in the trashcan!"
3,The end of the first saga,"We FINALLY meet Pilaf, the villain of the first Journey of Goku. The charathers stop being as flat, Kame-Sen'nin for example. The first Saga ends with a bang as we see Goku's dark side as the full moon rises. We also begin to see Goku's training until Kame-Sen'nin. This book is better over all then the last book, but lacking the charm of being ""the start of it all""."
5,"hey it's dragonball, so it's gotta be good","well i'm a dragonball veteran and i've pretty much read the whole series, and i know all about dragonball z, i'll say that any dragonball comic is good. it does not matter which one it is. they are all just great. i gave it 5 stars because it just downright hilarious, and it has an awesome storyline. there is a lot of action and funny parts, i would not recommend this book, or volume one and three, because goku is still pretty stupid and does not know that much, and he does not get embarrassed. so you will probobly see a little bit of frontal a rear nudity, of course akira toriyama did not put much detail in. (of course), except for maybe the part with Bulma, but you'll get to that. Anyway, i'm tellin ya, if you gonna get these books, start out with the first one and work you're way up from there, you'll definitly want to keep reading these, because they are funny and are just plain great."
3,Not as good as volume 1,In the secound volume of dragon ball Goku and his friends vist the ox kings home and tell him about the dragon balls. Luckly ox king has one but he will only give it to Goku if he can find his missing dughter for him. Goku sets out to find ox kings missing dughter Chi-chi but also needs to get Kame-shni(Trutle Hurmit) to help put out the fire on fry pan mountain. After Goku learns the Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha he Bulma and Oloung set out to find the last ball but peliaf captures them in his castle leaving them to die. Then when Goku looks at the full moon he could be just what they need to save the day. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is beacuse the volume get boring at times and isn't really good. Agian I don't recoumend this for childern this volume has alcohol nudity and some rude humor. Anyway after buying it you may only read a few times.
3,very good at times,"knee supports are very difficult to make and most of them don't last very long. this product is the best of the bunch so far. it is easy to adjust and it fits well. but like all knee braces it is not prefect, but very good."
2,Better quality control required,"A beautiful guitar, and just the right size. However, it would not stay in tune and the POTS sometimes would not work at all, and sometimes would just suddenly start to work. I sent it back and after my last couple of experiences wit Epiphone I would not buy another until their quality control is seriously upgraded."
2,No need to count sheep anymore,This is oh so boring!Couldn't be more slow and painful.I almost crash while listening to it in my car. Should include a warning:Do not listen when operating heavy machinery or driving.Don't buy it!!!
2,Bird Cage,"Cage was not what was expected. Size was good, but feeder bins wouldn't stay in bars and stand they sent was to osmall for the cage so no stand for it."
3,not good for cockatiel or lovebirds,this is a very good cage for smaller birds but you need a cage at least 24x24 for cockatiels and lovebirds. a 30x24 is great for birds so they have space to fly.
4,This movie will blow you away,"Originally this was a mini-series on NBC Television starring Harry Hamlin of ""LA Law,"" Linda Koslowski of ""Crockadille Dundee,"" Stephanie Krammer of ""Hunter,"" and Robert Loggia as Nick Manicuso. An NBC television series was spun off from this mini-series starring Loggia called ""Manicuso FBI."" ""Favorite Son"" is the story about a U.S. Senator, ""Hamlin"" who is shot, but still manages to deliver a very heartfelt speach after being wounded which makes him America's ""Favorite Son."" As a result, he makes a run for the U.S. Presidency. This movie has some incredible twists and a fantastic ending. If you liked the more recent movie, ""Wild Things,"" you should enjoy this."
1,Only 174 minutes.,"I'll just have to read the novel, Favorite Son since the VHS release cut out 3 hours from the original series."
2,Favorite Son,"I saw this movie on TV a number of years ago and taped it at that time for my collection. Somehow, my copy was lost, so I decided to order another copy. I was sorry to see a lot of the original scenes were edited out of the copy I had ordered which takes away a lot from the original movie. I don't understand why they have to edit scenes from the original movie that is on video."
1,wow...,"I was truly amazed by how horrible this book really is. I was so excited to read it since it seems like such a good book but don't be fooled. I love to read but this book was so hard to get into, he confuses you and makes no sense the entire time."
5,Rabbit Crack,"We have two rabbits--a Rex and a wild bunny--both rescued from the local shelter. The wild rabbit will eat one of these here and there, but the Rex cannot get enough of these. He goes nuts when he sees the container or hears it when we shake it. I guess it is hit or miss, but if the rabbit likes these, he will REALLY like them--it is like crack! We have the fruit flavor as well--makes no difference, he loves both."
2,"Rabbit loves them, but not healthy","Rabbit charges me for them if he sees or hears the container. He loves them, but for the same reason I love do-nuts. These are NOT healthy for bunnies. 1 a day wont hurt, but I had trouble sticking to this. A piece of dried fruit is a much healthier option for bunny and he enjoys it just as much. I suggest OXBOW treats (all natural and very safe for rabbits). Trust my opinion, I am a small animal veterinary specialist. I only purchased these because I try products out on my bunny before I sell it in my clinic. This will not be sold in my clinic."
3,Yogies for Rabbits,"My rabbit loves these Yogies! So when the local pet store was out, I needed to go to Amazon to satisfy his cravings. Ordered 4 cans and all four were melted goobs of yogurt. Gonna stay away from online orders of this item. I guess he's gonna have to wait until the local store has them in stock."
4,As advertized,Recommended for those who prefer a large mouse pad not to run out of space when maneuvering with teir mouse.
2,Size is nice but smell is not.,"I read the reviews and figured people were over reacting about the smell. They were not! After using the product my arms smell like the pad through my shirt. It was strong enough that my cube neighbor commented on it. I attempted washing it hoping that might take the edge off, it did not. I was only able to use it for about 2.5 hours before I began to get a sinus headache.The pad is a nice size and thickness however it does not smell like any other rubber backed mouse pad I have.Buy this with EXTREME CAUTION!-well unless you don't have a sense of smell."
2,Good size but strong chemical smell,"This mousepad is a great size, just what I was looking for as far as size is concerned. However it has a very very strong chemical smell that has not gone away even after a week. It gives me frequent headaches and ultimately makes the mousepad unusable. If you're in the market for a large mousepad, I recommend keep on looking..."
5,We love these!,"I happened upon one of these giant mouse pads a while back and thought it would solve all my problems. Well, it certainly did solve my mouse problems, anyway. I have a big desk and was constantly having my mouse drop off the back or the side of the mouse pad which was really annoying. My husband saw how much I liked the one I had and decided he wanted one for gaming - we now have one of these mousepads at every computer in the house. They last for years, are easy to keep clean. Can't ask for more than that from a mousepad!"
4,"If you buy behind the curve, this game is a must-buy","I always wait a few years to buy a game so:1. My machine can handle it2. I don't have to pay an arm and a leg for something I might not enjoyAs far as FPS games go, this is a great addition to an already-bloated genre.For a quick-and-dirty review: Technically and gameplay-wise, this is a great offering, with relatively few glitches or bugs and a unique and wonderful environment. Combat can be tight and focused, or intense and frantic. If you normally have ""savemygameanitis"" like I do and expect to be able to quicksave at any time, you can still experiment with different play styles and tactics without feeling hampered by a lack of save points.If you haven't played this, pick it up for a bargain game that delivers a good ride."
3,It's fun,"Yeah it's a fun. IT's one of those games where you don't want to make contact if you don't have to, the second you fire your weapon, doesn't matter what kind of weapon it is, and how far away, backup's going to be on you most riki-tik. It's an older game which I dig. The maps are huge, and fun to explore."
1,Good luck with the installation,"Note - I am rating the product as a whole, not the gameplay.I bought this as a sealed Jewel Case, the 5CD version. Installing it went allright until the fifth CD, when a file could not be copied. (The CD's were all new and looked to be in great shape).Upon googling the error message, this appears to be a common issue with rewritable drives, but even my ROM drive did not work, nor any of the other 4 I tried on other machines. So alas, while this is evidently a great game judging from other reviews, I did not get past the install screen. From what I could research, this appears to be caused by the rather finicky copy protection (SafeDisc), which in my case twarted my installation as well. So - if you can install, it might be great, if you don't have the time to mess with an inoperative product, avoid this product."
4,It's pretty good... not AMAZING but good.,"I have not yet received this game but I know for a fact that it is really fun. Good graphics, and runs well, even on my crappy laptop(I run it on high). One problem though is the hardness of difficulty. Some people like very difficult games but I only when I know easy mode is easy, and normal is normal. Not when Easy is Normal, Normal is hard, and Hard is Hardcore.Anyways, the most fun I have had with this is the Sandbox editor. The normal game is meh. Multiplayer I have never played. As for mods.... it looks like there is still a somewhat thriving community. I give it a 8.5 on a normal scale"
3,Fun but frustrating,"This game is great until you find out there is no manual saves. You have to proceed through a lot of each level before it saves. I am an average skill level gamer and I found even on the easiest setting, I would have to start the same level over again sometimes 20-30 times! Yes, I used walkthroughs to help me on occasion. It gets very annoying quickly. That being said, this is a game with great graphics and gameplay even by todays standards. I played it on Vista and it worked fine. Great game to play- but be prepared to start same level over and over.....again. If not for the lack of manual saves, I would have given it a 5."
2,caught in the middle,"Cuando otros juegos de mayor respeto aparecieron ganando terreno rapidamente, FarCry tuvo ke luchar x su puesto como uno de los favoritos, si la competencia no fuese tan ruda (aunke siempre lo ser) FarCry seria el mejor fps del 2004, sin dudo lo fue."
2,Didn't install,"Before buying this game, I didn't notice if it says if it works on a 64 bit system, but just to warn you, it doesn't right out of the box. There is a downloadable 400Mb plus size patch that supposedly makes it work on a 64 bit system. I say supposedly because, I downloaded the patch and tried to install it. Every time I got to the point the install asked what directory to install to, I would click on the OK button, and it would just return me to that same dialog. Nothing I did fixed this. I looked online and found a couple of others describing the same problem, but I found no suggestions on how to fix it. I'll keep looking. Until then I'll leave it at this rating."
3,XP only. Not what I paid for.,Works with XP not Win 7 64 bit. Although this is an older game the XP only versions must be the ones Amazon was discounting so they would have to be pretty old stock at the time. I guess that's a buyer beware thing but there was nothing in the advertising at the time. The box does say AMD 64 but no way it works with WIN 7 64.
5,Better than expected,"Before I played the game I read really good reviews from other players, but I had no idea it would this great. The graphics are outstanding"
5,Excellent,One of the best FPS games of it's time. Graphics are still great when compared to current games... One of the best features is that you can hide in jungles without being seen through the grass like in many other games.
2,good for mopping tile,"Leaves floor rather wet,I would not use on wood. This unit performs NOTHING like the infomercials. I kept it for mopping only. I have alot of tile and it works great on it. If I had to do it again I would buy the other shark machine for $99. NOTHING ELSE really worked on this machine.UPDATE!!! The whole machine wouldnt turn on before I had had it even six months... What garbage.. Plastic pieces were cracking and couldnt stand up to the heat.. The machine just died.. Save your money"
4,Positives and negatives,"Bought one after seeing a friend use hers. The unit works well I know but the downsize for me is the clumsiness aspect. No storage unit for all the attachments, so I had to go buy a carry bag to haul the attachments in. My unit has a roller caddy and a shoulder carrier which is nice. Bought the extra terry pad set up. Ended up giving it away to someone on a Freecycle group I belong to. My cottage is easy to clean and if I need a steam cleaner one of the makers small hand units does the job better for me."
3,Offers great cleaning but you need patience...,"I have had the Euro-Pro for over 3 years now. I absolutely love the work it does. It easily removes soap scum, stains in the sink, grimy grease on the stove and kitchen cabinets and cleans shower doors well.The only downfall is the waiting period. Before re-filling you have to observe the cooling period, otherwise you might risk the chance of burning yourself from the hot steam. This process can take upto 15-20 minutes. Other than that, this product is effective and very useful. I use it in my kitchen, bathroom, car, & floors."
1,bad units,it seems that the steamer only works twice the two times it does work its great but then it is over the steamer just quits all together this is my second one to quit and my friends third one so we will not try another thank you i was so dissapointed it was so good and a needed item for cleaning but it wont hold up
4,Excellent Overview of the Issues,"Very enjoyable and informative book, with a lot of personality and background. This is a great overview of the issues surrounding the authenticity of the Bible and the challenges leveled by Gnostic thought. My only desire was for more elaboration on the Gnostic writings, and a more complete examination of Cannonization. However, these issues are probably beyond the scope of a quick read."
1,I've got a great idea,"The Da Vinci Code is a worldwide phenomenon, staying on the New York Times Bestseller List for over 2 years. I think I'll throw together a quicky book with some alternate intepretations of biblical ""history"" that I got from looking up websites with Google one weekend. I'll slap the name ""Da Vinci Code"" in the title of my book and market it to delusional paranoids who spend every waking minute thinking about how the arts and entertainment world is at war with Christianity. I'll make a forture off someone else's success. It sure beats working for a living!God Bless America"
4,Thoughtful Response,"This book covers the differences between the New Testament documents and the Gnostic documents, between heresy and orthodox doctrines, and how we know what we know about the New Testament. The book is a thoughtful response to the assertions in the ""Da Vinci Code."" It covers how the books in the New Testament became canonized. The book is not intended to cover all the misinformation in ""The Da Vinci Code."" The author stays pretty close to his expertise and does a good job of explaining his points. The book is a little dry in the middle, but overall it was a good presentation of conservative/evangelical views of who Jesus is and why an accurate historical view of Jesus and Mary Magdalene is important."
4,Elegant,"When I first received the candles, I frowned at the size. However, when I set them on the table, I was pleasantly surprised at how elegant they looked. Not too large and not too small. The light was perfect. Not overbearing on the eye. I recommend purchase all shapes and grouptogether."
3,Lemon Grass capsules,"I expected a bottle of capsules for the price and it comes in a tiny pouch. I would like to have known that before I bought them. They don't come with product information that is particularly useful, so if more were included that would help. I do now know how well they do because I gave them to my husband."
4,Worth the Read,"Mary does a better job of exegesis than most, and she is more complete than most, however she then has a habit of adding little extras in her conclusions.Her logic is sometimes flawed, coming to conclusions, right or wrong, that cannot be drawn from the passage at hand. This is especially true when she finds equality where equality does not exist.I wish she would have addressed True and False authorities more. In our world there are many who claim to be authorities but who are not. Or dealing with authorities that go beyond their true authority into areas they have not business. More should be said about dealing with true authorities that come into conflict with one another, ex. employer and husband, church leadership and husband, parent and husband, etc.That said I would highly recommend this book, and all of Mary Kassian's writings. She tackles unpopular subjects and does well presenting the Biblical teaching on the subjects."
3,science fiction,my least favorite of this series but it was a good science fiction read..... some of the other books by this author were more interesting..
4,All the sweet Promises,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and had great difficulty putting it down once I had begun. Elgin totlally engrosed me with her sympathetic approach.The story is of three girls from very different but plausible backgrounds, who by chance, end up meeting on a railway station on their way to their 'ship' in Scotland during World War II. It tells of their exploits and love stories as the war progresses. Whilst this was an era I was not alive in it felt extreamly real and the factual references were so accurate they amased me. Being the daughter of a World War II telegraphist also stationed in Scotland it made real many of the things the girls were involved in. Obviously Elgin was using her first hand knowlede to great effect. These girls became my friends whilst I read andI had to go on to read another of Elgin's masterpieces ."
5,A Great World War II Historical Romance,I am a big fan of this era my grandmother having lived just outside London during the Blitz. The book is about three young girls who join the WRNS (Women's Royal Naval Service) during World War II. They serve on a submarine depot ship in Scotland. They are each from very different backgrounds but the war brings them together and they develop a close friendship which lasts beyond the war years. The book charts each girls life in the service as well as their personal lives during the war. Elgin is a great writer who is able to bring you into the time period so that you can truly appreciate everything that this generation went through during World War II. I loved this book!!!
2,very technical,"This book is primarily for neurosurgeons and other medical professionals. Too technical for parents, educators, etc"
5,Fits on AC Flash from COWBOY STUDIO,"I just received this filter set and it fits perfectly on the AC flash I purchased for COWBOY STUDIO. There is another review on here says the filters doesn't fit on ADORAMA'S AC Flash. took that info into consideration, but i had to see for myself if the filters would fit the AC flash I have from cowboy studio and it did!!!"
1,Don't work,"I bought these to use with the strobe and the strobe is working in sync with my camera flash but no matter what I do, I can't see any colour from these filters, not even the slightest tint of colour."
2,Do Not Fit!,These caps do not fit the Adoroma AC slaves. You can kind of jam them on so that they stay but they are slightly bigger than the clear caps that come with the slaves. They seem to be the only Adorama brand so I have been unable to find a set that fits.
1,Useless,"This is so dumb. these do nothing to change the tone, color, or anythign else to the photo. useless. do not buy them just bc others say to. total waste other than my one year old likes to play with them"
5,More Stories of Dog and the Lives They Touch,This was purchased as a gift for someone who loves dogs. They were delighted to receive it and have enjoyed reading it.
1,Buy this if you want to have your laptop stolen.,They keyed versions can be unlocked within seconds with a hollowed out pen.
2,"An example of why ""psycho-history"" is dead","Granted, Erikson's book makes for a great read, but lacks any real credibility. This book, along with his book on Gandhi, demonstrate that one can read anything into people when seperated by time and space. Take everything you read with a grain of salt. There are many more Luther bios that are more accurate and useful."
1,I thought this book was about Luther!!!!!!!!,With what there is about luther can fill less than a hundred pages. There is too much on other topics instead of connecting them to luther. If he does than they are extremely weak.
5,A pioneering work in psychohistory,"This is Erikson's breakthrough work in psychohistory. He reads the inner conflicts of Luther and connects them convincingly with great historical events. In this particular case he chooses a historical figure whose violence in some way undermines and contradicts the very religious vocation his life is built upon. Erikson shows how the revolutionary Luther in conflict with his own violent father and himself turns against the world of corrupt medieval indulgence- laden Catholicism and uses his own personal energy and story to create a powerful change in history, the Reformation.This is an admirable piece of theorizing and research combined and a fascinating read."
3,The revelation in the tower,"The only memorable part of the book is Erikson's conjecture that Luther was sitting on the toilet reading the Bible when he experienced the revelation in the tower. Specifically, Erikson suggests that Luther, who suffered from constipation throughout his life, ran across Romans 1:17 (""The just shall live by faith"") as he managed a bowel movement. See pp. 201-206."
3,Perfect for the first year graduate student,"Erickson's work is intelligently written and is perfect for stimulating the first year history graduate student towards broadening his or her thoughts on history and historical figures. That said, the work is also a tedious read that at times is little more than a pedantic stream of the author's consciousness. In the end, one does not really feel that much has been learned about the inner life of Luther, or about his time and place. A worthy work to be sure, but certainly also a minor one of limited value."
4,Young man luther,I haven't read the book yet but Erikson is one of the foundations of psychology so I aim to read this book in the near future.
2,Too heavy of reading for me,A friend recommended this book and I attempted to read it but it was just too heavy of a read for me.
5,Great Ferret treat.,My 2 kids are VERY finicky about their snacks. This is 1 of 2 treats they will eat. (The other is also from this manufacturer) If you're looking for a treat your little furries will love...this is it!
1,Horrible!,"People need to research before buying ferret treats. These contain a ton of sugar and yogurt, two things that ferrets cannot digest. They are carnivores and eat meat! Excessive consumption of sugar can lead to insulinoma- not worth the risk in my opinion."
2,DO NOT GIVE YOUR FERRET MORE THAN 1 A DAY!!!!,"I just got the product today and decided to give one to my ferret. BabyNelly absolutely loved the taste of the peanut butter Yogies -- BUT -- when I gave her 2 in a row (because the package CLAIMS ferrets can have up to 5 per day), she reacted terribly to it!! She started biting me (which she has never done) and biting her hands and feet FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS STRAIGHT!! I thought I was going to have to take her to the vet. Finally the sugar wore off and she fell asleep - phew- that was so scary!! THE INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD SAY TO GIVE FERRETS ONLY ONE PER DAY!! PLEASE BE CAREFUL!! This product has a lot of sugar in it (it's the first ingredient listed!) and ferrets do not react well to that much sugar if more than one a day is given."
1,Poor Quality Item,This item is not as represented. The treats are supposed to be chip sizebut were all melted into a lump at the bottom of the bag and couldn'tbe separated. I had ordered these before and they were thesame way. I thought maybe it was just a one time issue andtried ordering again. Again the item came in unusable condition.
1,Please don't use!,Ferrets can not digest these properly! If you do your research before you buy you'd learn that ferrets are obligate carnivores which means they don't even have organs to do so. If you want to treat your little fuzzy do so in meat! Chicken is a favorite of mine. This will make them happy and live longer.
4,A Fascinating Glimpse of Ancient Warfare,"Julius Caesar's self-promoting memoirs of his time as a Roman general in Gaul are a surprisingly interesting read. While it is a bit hard to keep track of the shifting alliances between the many Gallic tribes, Caesar describes Roman battlefield maneuvers, siege warfare, and diplomacy in a clear, readable manner. I felt that the subtext of the book was ""I, Julius Caesar, am an awesome general and savvy diplomat. I always displays great reason and mercy but am not afraid to punish treachery."" Nevertheless, it is a fascinating look at warfare in the ancient world."
5,Seven Commentaries on the Gallic War,"In response to the reviewer from Lakeland: while the reviewer you critique obviously doesn't have the knowledge to comment on this book, Caesar did live in the first century B.C. Though the reviewer doesn't specify A.D. or B.C., you must be careful in making statements such as you did."
1,Let the buyer beware!,"This album contains a large selection of some of the best songs to come out of the 80s. All of the greats are here, such as Every Breath You Take, I Want To Know What Love Is, Time After Time, and so forth.But, let the buyer beware! These are not the songs performed original artists, but remakes. To make matters worse, the quality of the songs is not great. For example, I found With Or Without You to be painful to listen to.No, do not (like I did, unfortunately) think that this is a collection of the *original* great love songs. The album cover clearly says, ""Performed By The Stars of Studio 99"".I found this to be a very disappointing album to listen to, and I would never recommend it."
2,"Geez, what a piece of junk","Satire is really really really rilly rilly hard to get right. People whose name is not Vonnegut, Heller, etc. should not bother to try, thankyouverymuch.Look, I understand what he was trying to go for, but it doesn't cut the mustard. Try Lem instead. Or try Canticle for Leibowitz... Sykaos is compared to that book sometimes and it is not a decent comparison-- Canticle is actually good, and Sykaos is very limp."
4,Blue's Room fans,"We do not invest in TV so I purchased the Blue's Room Shape Detectives dvd on reputation and my daughter's mass interest in a commercial for Blue's Room on one of her other dvds. We have become big fans of Blue's Room. The characters are great and speak intelligently to my daughter. It is intereactive and fun for her to watch. Even the acter, ""Joe"", is fun to watch and doesn't monopolize the show. On the other hand we are not as big a fans of Blue's Clues. My daughter is not particularly interested in cartoons unless they happen to be singing (ie Backyardigans) and I find it rather demeaning to her. I personally don't like ""Steve"". His whole role is ""misunderstanding"" and ""lack of attention"" to the ""audience"" to where the childen on the video have to repeat themselves several times before he gets a ""clue"". The video contains two Blue's Room and two Blue's Clues episodes. I tend to skip over the BC."
2,Partial Book,I was very disappointed to find out that I had to download multiple files to have a complete book. That was not clear in the summary description!
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"IT TOOK FOREVER TO RECEIVE THE BOOK. I HAD BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT AND HAD DONE EVERYTHING I COULD TO REASSURE MYSELF THAT THE ADDRESS I WANTED THE BOOK SENT TO WAS WHERE THE BOOK WAS GOING. WELL, IT GOT SENT TO ME INSTEAD, AND I AM HOMEBOUND, SO NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEND THE BOOK MYSELF. MADE ME VERY UNHAPPY."
1,Incomplete: Missing Passages,"This edition is missing some passages from the original works. For example, there are about three pages missing (as measured from a paperback copy) from Chapter 21 of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."
2,Good but missing pages,It has been years since I read these two books. There was a lot that I had forgotten about them. Was really disappointed that I would be reading along and I would turn a page and would have lost 10-15 pages. Would really like to see this fixed and notified so I can delete this issue and get corrected copy....
2,Dragging,I had to use my will power to finish the book. I am not saying that the story on the whole is horrible but I found it so dragging. I do understand it has a historic importance but for me it was more like reading a study book then a book to look forward during the day to read.
2,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huck Finn,"This book was kind of confusing so in my opionon it is not ment for people grades three throught five. Allthough there were some parts I did enjoy like when Tom ,Joe ,Huck ran away to an island."
2,Do not rely on the CD for the tutorial,"Not only are the confidence builder files missing, but a number of the source files used in the tutorial are in mpeg format, which cannot be used as source files with MACs (unless you purchase Quicktime Pro which is an additional $29.99) or with Windows if you don't have a capture card that supports mpeg-2. (see the Adobe 6.5 help site at http://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/29ad2.htm )After going back and forth with technical support on the book for three weeks, they've determined I need a different capture card on my computer. I determined that the CD is useless! I have no idea why they would use source files that cannot be imported using Adobe Premiere 6.5 in a coursebook on learning Adobe Premiere 6.5. It was incredibly frustrating! If you do not wish to walk through the projects on the CD, I'm sure the book is useful, but if you actually want to go through the course, make sure you have Windows and a capture card that supports mpeg-2."
1,no your not crazy,"the cd dosent work!!!!.I spent hours trying to do the first session but it just doesnt happen.The cd is useless you cant down load files,go vegas 4.0"
4,Pleased,The book was in great shape as promised. It is a used book so it looks like a used book.There were no rips or discolorations just your normal fading. I would happily buy from this seller again.
5,Absolutely Delightful... And Delicious!,"I don't know what it is about this book, but each night after reading this book to my daughter, I get cravings for pasta.""Noodle Man"" is my 4 year old daughter's number one most requested bedtime story. The story is original, if a little clunky at times, but it is Stephen Costanza's whimsical illustrations that really make this book shine.My daughter never tires of tracing the loopy, convoluted path the two trapped boys would make down the ""Lasagne Slide."" The deftly illustrated picture of a group of people ""Fusili Bouncing"" also gets squeals of delight.As an added bonus, my daughter now can name more pasta varieties than most kids her age.Do your child a favor and purchase this enchanting book!"
2,Major letdown,"I'm a big fan of the Church. I have most of their albums. There is very little of theirs that I can't find something redeeming to say about. The album's OK. But definitely not recommended. 3 songs stand out: ""Overview,"" ""Unified Field,"" and ""Day 5."" The rest is listenable but quite boring for the band I am usually praising with the utmost respect. This album sounds like many outtakes one would imagine never made it to release status. Before opening the album, I turned to my wife and said, ""This is me at my happiest."" Before the album was over my wife and I decided to go for a walk."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this for my husband he uses it to get from his car to his office, a short walk. After one month the handle came of and was unrepairable and the company said ""Sorry, 30 days, no returns"" I told them there isn't a mark on this and it is your handle that broke.Again ""30 days"" so I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT."
2,Shoulder strap?,"The picture shows a D ring on either side of the case for a clip on shoulder strap so I ordered one. -but there aren't rings on my suitcase.i changed my rating to two stars because its not only missing rings for shoulder straps (as advertised), its paint chipped almost immediately after opening. not only against hard surfaces. against almost anything. like the trunk of my car.."
1,you get what you pay for,"Unless you want to keep this in the house for storing documents, don't buy it.Easily bends, scratches and punctures. I had it out of the house for 3 days and it looks like I owned it for 3 years.I have it in black; the paint scratches away just buy rubbing the briefcase on the side of the leg.All in all, if you want a nice, black aluminum briefcase get a different brand at a higher cost. For $40 you only get frustrated."
1,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this using my one day shipping option because it was a last minute gift for my boss. the girls I work with couldn't afford much and we were splitting the cost for this. When it arrived (one the day of our Christmas party) I opened it up to look at it and found that the whole inside organizer was not attached! I didn't have time to return it and get another so I fixed it myself with some strong glue. I hope it holds. Anyway, I knew it wouldn't be the best, but it was what we could afford. But you think it could have been in one piece!"
1,Item being reviewed,"The Roarpro SPC-941G 17.5 X 4 X 13 Aluminum Briefcase-black (1 each) looks very nice in appearance but most of the inside was unglued from the frame, when i opened it. It was a gift, therefore, i did not send it back or complain about it,but I would not recommend it or buy another one.I think the company selling it should of checked it before shipping it out."
3,Attractive case that fits my purposes,"I don't usually submit reviews, but I felt compelled to balance out the negative reviews. Would it be nice if it had the quality and workmanship of briefcases costing $200 or more? Of course. But I think it's worth the price. The negatives: 1. the lock feels like a toy. I'm actually afraid to change the combination from ""000 - 000"" for fear that I'll end up having to break the lock to open it. 2. the inside is lined with a goofy synthetic material that's barely attached. 3. There is a strange odor. I think it's the glue or the lining. It might just need to be aired out.In the interest of full disclosure, I'm only using this as a means to contain the contents of my desk at home. If you're a road warrior you might think about getting something of a higher quality - especially where the lock is concerned.Note: you might notice a side hook in one of the photos, which implies you could put a side strap on this. There is no side latch on the unit I received."
2,"nice case, bad locks","the locks on this case do not operate properly. Set the numbers/lock, than it fails to function. Recommend if you need locks to work, avoid this product."
3,Great briefcase except...,"It came in packaging that was perfect to keep it protected from damage, however it was already damaged. There were several small dents and obvious scratches on the case. I just did not have the energy to send it back. I needed the case for immediate use."
2,I like the looks,"It was good for a while but i dropped it and now one of the locks doesn't close, it wasnt well built but it did its job for a while"
4,One False Move,A must read for Myron fans. Slightly above average for the series. Reading it on Kindle was a suprisingly pleasant experience.
4,Kindle edition really needs an editor,"The Kindle edition is fraught with typographical errors; 'the' is frequently spelled 'die' and 'soitball' is presumably 'softball', beats me what 'inof' means, 'uke' I think means 'like' and 'shidoad' well, these are the easy ones to translate. Every other page has unbelievable spelling errors some totally unintelligible.Other than a book edited/copied by an 'idat' this is one fun read. Hopefully the next book I download doesn't have this problem."
4,Another winner,"Although there were some plot holes in this book (I don't like to leave spoilers, so let's just say Myron seemed to fall in love too easily considering his worship of his old girlfriend), it's still another well-written piece of work. Coben's style makes it easy to get lost in the book and not want to put it down until it's done. Sure, like some of the other critics have said, there are some improbabilities (Win, the superhuman killer preppy) but get over it. It's fiction. For sheer entertainment and ease of reading you can't go wrong with any of the Bolitar books."
4,Best Bolitar Book,"I have read all of Harlan Coben's books (his stand-alones and the Myron B. series). I am not crazy about the Myron series. The characters seem so unrealistic. People get beatup, shot and stabbed. Myron and Win just dust themselves off and continue while sub-characters end up dead. But, i really enjoy Coben's writing. He always adds so many interesting details. Also, there are so many red herrings that the ending is always a surprise. One False Move was one of the better Bolitar books. The ending was really unexpected and left me thinking. I would definitely recommend this book."
4,Unbelievable,"I really enjoy the Myron Bolitar sport agent crime novels. I loved this novel. First of all, let me say that you need to read this series in order because it slowly reveals different aspects of the characters. The mystery in this one isn't the best one so far. However, I give it a higher rating for the progression of the characters in the big picture. I didn't like that Mr. Coben had another basketball player in this one. I was looking for him to jump to another sport like he has in the past. I felt we didn't get to know the new lead character, Brenda Slaughter that well. I thought we would get more dialogue with her and Myron so we could truly see what was going on. I again loved the interactions between Myron and Win. I really enjoy the Win character in this series. I think he lends a mysterious aspect to it. I would highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a quick read and a book with numerous twists."
5,A pleasant read,"This was my first exposure to Mr. Coben's Myron Bolitar. I found that I liked the character, and the story stood up well on it's own, despite being another in a series. The writer has a smooth, easy to read, style that retains your attention. The characters contained some stereotypes, but all in all, they were believable. Not having read any previous Bolitar adventures, I was anxious for him to break with the old girlfriend and explore the possibilities of the new. Brenda was a refreshing breath of air, going against the typical racial & sexual stereotypes. I was saddened with the ending. I recommend this book, and I believe I will be reading other Bolitar adventures in the future."
2,Not a Great Move,"I was not impressed with this book at all. I downloaded the book on Audible after reading the reviews about it on Amazon. The story line is interesting and there are a lot of good scenes, but what I really did not like was the way the book let me down at the end. I kept saying to myself is this it? I think if the story had a better well thought out ending, I could have given it three stars instead of two."
3,Good But Not Great,"Don't get me wrong, I really like this Myron Bolitar series. I especially like the interaction between Myron and his friend and associate, Win. I also like more action and this story kind of dragged in the beginning. Yes, this is a good mystery, but slow developing. I gave it three stars because it really picked up after the half way point and has an ending that you will never guess."
4,Good Tale!,THis was another great adventure for Myron and Win. It was interesting how Myron digs into a mystery and just will not let go until he figures everything out.
5,Thrilling,The last few chapters are very fast paced and exciting. Many emotions went through Myron which transferred to the reader.
3,One false move,It was OK. Good in parts but not memorable. Never needed to know what happened next. Middle of the road for me.
4,One True Review,Not one of my favorite Harlen Coben books but a very good one. Classic Myron Bolitar. There are a few mistakes in the translation to the kindle version though. I believe Wins name is Winsor HORNE (not Home) Lockewood.
4,One False Move,Fun read like all of Coben's work. I have never been disappointed with a book in this series by the author.
4,Coben's vivid characters,"This is the third myron bolitar book I have read and Coben continues to impress me with his blend of character development, interesting puzzles to solve, unexpected red herrings and excellent pacing. The wry observations by Bolitar - sometimes expressed, sometimes merely mused upon as he contemplates his next move - make me laugh out loud, and I wish i could conjure a Win and Esperanza for my life. Keep 'em coming!"
5,Truly great!,This is one of the early ones; I have read it before but needed a new copy. I enjoy his books a lot and laugh the whole time I am reading his books.
4,another good one,"another good coben novel.....I can't wait to read them all, we pass them around in the office."
2,Wonderful Adventures of Bulletproof Clowns,"On the plus side the plot is simply superb, on the minus side the delivery is extremely annoying.Also, in the background there is a constant drone of class envy by a low multiple millionaire towards high multiple ones - which would be simply laughable in small dosage and it is very annoying because it constitutes at lest 10% of the text."
2,Stick with Lonely Planet!,"I recently spent the month in Southeast Asia. I thought I could save time, money, and space by buying just one guidebook for the region. So I bought the Rough Guide to Southeast Asia. A BIG MISTAKE! I ended up throwing the book out in Bangkok and switching to bootleg Lonely Planets for sale all over Southeast Asia for about [price]!I had heard good things about the Rough Guide, but personally found the book not that usefull at all.I do not recommend buying this book. LP is the way to go!"
5,Perfect started Bible.,"perfect started Bible, easing to read and understand in todays language, was purchased for each of my two pre-teen grandchildren, perfect for that age group."
4,Bible in a Nutshell. . .,"The Bible is complicated to some. However, this version gives a clear view of what the writers were saying in olden times. I've always had several versions of the Bible. If you're a beginner, start with this version then compare verses with other versions and you will come out with a much deeper understanding of God's Word. Highly recommended!"
5,"Best Seller ,all true stories. Must read.","I required four bibles to pass on to my sons. They are all mature men and possibly havent ever held a bible in their hands. As their father I was prompted by a strong feeling that this is something that I had to do. God knows, they might even open them and read them one day...."
1,Not a translation.,"This is not a translation. It is a paraphrase. Kenneth Taylor does not know the ancient biblical languages he simply wrote a ""bible"" based on his interpretations of Gods word. When you read this you are not reading God's words---you are reading Kenneth Taylors words. A big difference."
1,Living Bible,"This book was listed as having Large Print, when in fact it does not. I am very disappointed that Amazon misrepresented the facts regarding this book, and will reconsider using Amazon as my primary source when purchasing books in the future."
1,NO Red Lettering!,"I specifically purchased this Bible because the ""Look Inside"" pages had red lettering. But when it arrived, I was very disappointed to find absolutely no red lettering. I purchase almost everything through Amazon, and 99% of the time I'm delighted, but unfortunately, this was a dud. Amazon, please change the ""Look Inside"" to accurately reflect what's really in the book."
4,It's good but not like the original,"I like this translation for daily reading and study because it is much easier to understand than the NIV or KJV. I don't obsess over using one translation over another as I think actually understanding what is being said is much more important.That said, I was a little disappointed when I opened the package. I have my mom's original copy of this from several decades ago and wanted one of my own. Although a very minor complaint, the binding much more plain than the original. However I was more disappointed to see that this version abandoned the usage of red font for the words of Jesus. If this is important to you, I believe Amazon sells used copies of the original.The hard binding is a feature not to be overlooked. Many bibles have a flexible front/back which makes reading difficult if you are not at a desk or table."
4,Living Bible,"The only problem with this Bible on a Kindle Touch is that it is rather difficult to select the chapters once a book of the bible has been selected (on the first page of the specific book, i.e. Proverbs). The numbers of the chapters are too close together."
3,NLB Preferred,"The New Living Bible is a better translation. The Word of God is good, but some translations are better than others"
5,my wife loves this translation,Got this for my wife and she loves it - she had this translation and somehow misplaced it - she was so happy when I got her this replacement - it is her go to for reading the Word. I have read some of it and like how it is written in an easy to read manner and seems faithful to the source materials.
5,THE BEST,"I read a number of translations and find the Living Bible the easiest to understand. If I had to pick one to read for the rest of my life or for eternity for that matter, This would be it. Perfect for a new believer. I especially enjoy Proverbs and read them just about every day to coincide with the date of the month. I was given a copy of the LB called ""The Way"" back in the 70's. I can't tell you how many times GOD has spoken to me through it. Makes a Great gift. Just got it on Kindle."
5,Most understandable version of the Bible,"There are many translations of the Bible, many in contemporary English. In my Bible study classes, we read from several translations including the updated version of this one - the New Living Bible (NLB.) I still prefer the paraphrases of this TLB vs. even the NLB or the Message. Verse numbers are preserved, unlike The Message. But I really like the fact that the author, Ken Taylor, expresses what the narrator of the original text was trying to say. At times, in comparison to the NLB, there are differences due to the influence of ""bible scholars"" referring back to ancient Greek or Aramaic texts. However, I still prefer Ken Taylor's interpretation."
4,Love the Living but not the print,"I love the Living Bible. I got it as a new Christian about 35 years ago, and it greatly helped me. It was the first Bible I read cover to cover. I got one for my mother and she got saved, though she had thrown out the King James in disgust as unintelligable.This edition has really good fake leather, good (not all stuck together and needing seperating) gold page edges, and is well made.However, I was mislead by another review mentioning larger print that she gave an older person. It must have beem refering to another edition. This one is only 9 point print. Your average newspaper is ten point. For older or weaker sighted people get the NLT in 12 or 14 point type."
5,Very easy to read,Love reading this version. It is very easy to read and understand yet keeps the original intent of Scripture very well.
3,The Living Bible,"The Living BibleI bought this Bible to replace my mom's older version that had come apart from years of use. I thought this Bible was an exact duplicate since the copyright date was 1974; however there were slight differences in this reprint. First, the print is lighter. Then, the passages do not all start at the beginning of a line; some scriptures begin in the middle of a line and the numbers are very small. This was a problem for an older person, especially when one is following along when scripture is being read. It is also difficult for an older person to read the smaller and lighter print."
5,EASY READING,"The Living Bible reads like a novel. It is more easily understood than the more conventional versions of the Bible, i.e. KJV, NIV and others. I have taught Sunday School in a Protestant church for 40 years and find that our members will read this Bible with interest and are able to discuss what they have read. I would recommend this Bible for those just beginning to read the Bible and even those who have read the Bible all their life."
5,.The Bible paraphased Billy Graham edition,GreatBible book we read to the boys especially the proverbs a day and it brings it alive in everyday life for them.
5,living Bible helps you live,"This paraphrase of the Bible did more to help me in my spiritual growth than any Bible I had ever read. When I began to get serious in my Christian walk, I tried to read my Bible like I was supposed to but reading King James Version made me not want to read it all. The Living Bible spoke to me about how God wanted me to live my life in language I could understand. I highly recommend the Living Bible for new Christians who want to grow with God."
3,Makes the Bible Really Come Alive,"Some 35 years after its release, The Living Bible Paraphrased can still excite. Be aware that this is indeed a paraphrase, and NOT a translation, and has been done by one man, the late Ken Taylor. It is meant as a reading Bible, and not meant for study---if you want to seriously study the Bible, use a good, formal equivalent translation, such as NASB, HCSB, NKJV, KJV, or even the NIV, for that matter. Untold thousands of people came to Christ, thanks to the Living Bible. God used this book in a powerful way. Many persons who never, ever, would pick up a Bible, read the Living Bible and became Christians. I've seen people carrying this green hardback for so long that it had actually turned black, and would read no other Bible. This particular edition, I could do without the red lettering very easily. But, as I stated above, this will make the Bible come so alive for you. Buy one. Try it---you'll like it."
2,Not as advertised!,I ordered this Bible because it was advertised as a red-letter edition. It is not - hence the 2-star rating! If the red-letter edition is important to you - do not order here; you will not receive what they are advertising!
3,Easy to read and understand,"Easy to read and understand. Abit difficult to use in class rooms when other versions are the primary use. Good for home use though. smc Murray, KY"
4,Good,"This is a very good Bible, I have read the KJV, the new KJV, and a few Hebrew/Greek versions, and even the 15th century version it is based on, and this dose a good job of keeping the story. although it is a very liberal translation, it is easy to read and understand, I recommend it to everyone who wants the read the Bible and understand it."
4,Original Living Bible,"This is the original (classic) edition of ""The Living Bible"". The publishers moved-on to another translation called ""The New Living Translation"" offering many editions of that, but only one remaining editon of ""The Living Bible"" -- this one. Thank God for that! This is a nicely bound (hardbound) bible (classic dark green), with quality paper and printing (Notice: this might not be a ""red-letter"" edition anymore). I wish they published it as a ""text bible"" since the footnotes seem rather obvious, but no big deal. Font size is approx. 8 pt (wish it was more like 10 pt). I think much of ""The Living Bible"" is nicely written because Kenneth N. Taylor had a knack for language and his heart was in the right place: ""When God began creating the heavens and the earth, the earth was at first a shapeless, chaotic mass, with the Spirit of God brooding over the dark vapors.""Celebrating 40 years, June 2011 Tyndale has issued a TuTone cover edition, ISBN: 1414358555"
4,paraphrase version of bible,I am not sure about this version. It doesn't seem as though this is the most easily understood version. A little disappointed in the ability to read the bible then look up in this version and understand what the original said.
5,Living Bible,This bible is very easy to read and understand. A big difference from the older version of bibles. Anyone who has a hard time trying to understand older versions of King James and other bibles would love the Living Bible. You can read it like a story and understand exactly whats going on. It is not boring. I would recommend it to anyone (even young readers) who are having a problem understanding older versions of the bible.AW
2,Find Somthing Better!!,"I am so disapointed with this mount. 1st of all the mount doesnt keep the plasma level verticly or horizontaly unless its completly against the wall. When the plasma is pulled out from the wall it tilts ""back"" and drops about 6in. down to the right. i adjusted it over and over again while it was pulled out and while it was flat against the wall. and it doest matter. While its out,i finaly get it level and i push it in and its tilted all wrong. Finaly the main arm on the mount bent. Prohibiting the TV mount to go againt the wall without me haveing to ""Pick"" the tv up and push it against the wall. One of the bearings on the arm has warn away under the weight of my tv making it extreamly dificult to move in and away the wall. My tv ways 97lb. and this is rated for 150lbs. The mount itself ways around 40lbs. so when i picked it up it felt sturdy and secure. Unfortiuntly this mount fails to deliver. I would defently spend the extra $$ to get a HIGH quality mount."
2,Not user friendly,"This product is made to fit a range of TV sizes, however, it does not line up with the mounting holes in the back of my TV so I must improvize. Package was missing instructions and list of compatable units."
5,Toy Trouble,I think Toy Trouble is a great and really spooky book because your able to feel the fear not like any other ordinary book. Also the book has an outstanding cover with a colorful picture picture that no other book shows. And also your able to feel the excitment when you take time out to read this great book
5,Good Christian Foundations for Fathering (New/Old),"This was a very good book. I have a teenage stepdaughter, and a one month old daughter. This book laid down the foundations for fathering of both children with Godly principles. A definite must read for us ""dads in progress."""
4,Casts a good vision for what fathers should be,"As a new dad, this book helps prepare for me what lies ahead and points me in the right direction. While Canfield's writing style isn't strong and the book is not as concise as one would like, the ideas he presents are very relevant and challenging. He strikes a good balance between communicating the serious responsibility it is to be a father and instilling confidence that the potential to be great is within every father. If you are a father, this book is worth your time. Also, the appendecies contain some great information, so be sure not to overlook them. Recommended."
3,Not bad,"I opted for this because the BAM was so expensive. The pocket is nice, but it's not the full width of the case, so I can't put in a big folder without leaving the zipper open and having it stick out. The A clarinet does not make not a precise fit where the keys don't quite align with the spaces for them. The space for the A bell is Bb sized. It fits, but not quite right. I mean, did they try to put an A clarinet in it?"
2,Conflicting Photos from Amazon,"The Amazon website for the sale of this product has a problem. If you look and the photo second from the left, it clearly shows the clarinet stored left to right with a handy place inside the case to store music. If you look at the photo second from the right and third from the right it shows a case with the instrument going the opposite way, front to back, without a place to store music inside the instrument compartment. Anyone know which is correct?"
1,Horrible Side Effects,"Five years ago I took Stacker 2's to aid in weight loss and experienced great results with no side effects. Fast forward to the present; I have 10 pounds that I'd like to lose and decided to again seek a boost, this time with Stacker 3 XPLC. It was an awful decision on my part. Within minutes of taking 1 pill I begin to experience tachycardia (rapid heart rate), heart palpitations, tremors, cold sweats, dizziness, and nausea, and spent 2 days in the hospital for monitoring and observation. Experiencing nearly every single side effect that a diet pill can cause, all at once, was the absolute scariest situation that I have ever been in. I highly caution anyone thinking of taking this product to consult with their primary physician beforehand, and as I nurse I still cringe that I didn't."
2,Thankfully I didn't pay full price for this!,"This product is supposed to be the latest & greatest from a reputable contender in the legal-speed market. However, all it did was give me a bit of a stomachache--no energy boost that I could discern. So I'll be guzzling with once-daily pills with milk to help counteract that and see if anythinmg changes. In the meantime, Stacker 2 XPLC seems to work better and I would recommend that (which really does the trick) over this."
2,stacker 3 xplc,"If you like to feel like your going to vomit all day and sweat constantly<even at rest>, this is for you...I might have had a bad trip, but I honestly wished I would have vomited the minute I took this and saved me a day of misery...sweats, tremors, pounding heart rate...I kinda wish they woulda made these things in half dose and I coulda just taken 1 instead of 2 and maybe not felt like crap all day. i basically felt like I have had the flu all day"
3,Great for all nighters,"I'm in college. This has replaced my energy drinks when I need to cram. If you don't want to sleep, take it, otherwise, it doesn't do much. But for those long nights and days cramming for exams, AWESOME!!!"
4,Fits the Scene,"It satisfactorily completes my holiday display of Norman Rockwell buildings. By raising it on a sytrofoam base, it looks more realistic with a train waiting at the station."
5,Sensational!,"I was fortunate enough to pick up this CD last year after it was released to the European market. Although it is very pricey, it is truly one of his best! I am ordering a copy for a friend who is not an Ivan Lins fan (prefers Jobim and others) with confidence that he will re-evaluate this master of Brazilian music."
5,Beautiful tropical breeze!,"I also searched for this cd for sometime and finally found it on HMV.CO.JP. page. You can, or at least could have get it from there!The album... AH, what`s there to say?! Beautiful, melodic samba with class of Ivan Lins in it and we all know what that means! It`s the feeling - not describable by words! :o))) Thanks Ivan!"
5,One of her best,"This album is probably one of Yoko Kanno's best albums. The whole album is very strong, but 2 tracks alone, ""Flying Low"" and ""Know Your Enemy"" totally make this album. ""Flying Low"" makes you want to crank the stereo up to 11 and drive very, very fast.Some of the tracks you feel like you've heard before, they're very Yoko Kanno-ish, but they don't detract from the overall strength of the album."
3,WORST BOOK IN THE SERIES,"This book was definitely the worst book in the series. Not only did Ms. Applegate forget to take the time with this book, she lacked her incredible, vivid descriptions. It went by waaay to fast! I still don't understand the point in going to go see Hel again. She could've given them a confrontation with Ka Anor (we NEVER met him!!!) -- but instead we go back to Hel. I enjoyed number 4 (Realm Of The Reaper) about Hel, but I'd have rather read about someone who wasn't introduced yet. It was obvious she was tired of the series by nwo and completely gave up on doing a good job. I don't mind that it's open-ended but she COULD'VE answered more questions in this one or ended with JALIL!Overall, this book was just the worst."
3,Dan's Review,"this was a very good book, but as the end to a series of books it was one of those books where there could be FIVE or more books. the series rocked. this book explains that number one mission they've had since they entered the Ever World. there's not the usual action in this book, although some, it mostly deals with April and her choise to go home and the changes that happen along the way. Anyone who just happens to stumble across this who is totally into magic and fantacy should read this series of books. Welcome to Ever World!"
1,.... So... Was that the end??....,"Well.. I have to say, I'm incredibly disapointed, angry, disapointed... Isn't the conclusion a wrapping up of the loose ends?? If that's the case, wow! That wrapped up absolutely nothing. What happened with Christopher and Etain? Did they defeat Ka Anor?? Can they ever go back to the real world, or are they stuck in Everworld for the rest of their lives?? And what the heck happened with Ka Anor????? Wasn't there supposed to be some type of ENDING?? All that this book did was leave more questions unanswered. Applegate likes to leave ambiguity? Tell her she gets an A+ for this book, because its got all the ambiguity she could ever want. I'm sorry, Applegate, but this was a major disapointment."
3,is it really the end?,"I had to come here you find out what everyone else was saying to find out whether this book was really the end of the series. I am so disappointed that there will be no more of these books! The author left everything very open in the end, and it doesn't seem like anything was concluded. I think Applegate got tired of writing and just decided to stop with this series. I keep hoping that this is all a joke and pretty soon there will be another Everworld on the shelves, but it doesn't seem like its happening. How rude!"
3,what end??,"this book was great... the plot was great i should say. this book was like no ther Everworld book, it had more emotion and there was more conflict going on. there really is no end but the end does hint that there is more to come. I really did enjoy this book and i think all the everworld readers will."
2,Open ended,"I loved the whole series, especially book 11. I was waiting for a tremendous climax to the series and felt let down. The book just finished without finishing and left us all wondering. K.A. Applegate built us up for a grand finale and a battle against Ka Anor. She let us down with a quick fix but no answers. There were so many questions that one has to feel she lost interest or just wasn't selling enough of the series. I'm left dissappointed and waiting for Everworld 13, Conclude the Confusion."
1,The End? Oh come on!,"God, K.A. Applegate pisses me off so much.I absolutely loved her Everworld series, and I finally managed to track down the last few copies after a couple years.And then, I reach the ending of the book. What the hell is that kind of ending? All we learn is that the four decide to stay in Everworld. Nothing about Ka Anor, nothing about the Greeks, nothing about Christopher and Etain, nothing about how Everworld works, not even the Great Scroll. The list goes on and on.After hooking us on a dozen books, don't you think we deserve some sort of conclusion? Not a damn cop out. So thanks Applegate, you got the last laugh again. I could just stand the ending to Animorphs, at least we knew what happened to the Yeerks. But this? God.You write some fantastic novels. Please, just try to end them. Don't just throw manure into the faces of everyone who's been reading faithfully."
2,A not-so-entertaining end to the series.,"This book, the final in the EverWorld series, was very dissapointing. If it were not the last book, it would still be poorly written, but it would not have been as bad. This is due to the very open ending. Us, the loyal fans who have followed EverWorld since the beginning, deserve a better ending, one that TRULY tells what will happen to the characters now. If you're a loyal fan, you may as well go ahead and read this, but you won't find the closure you're looking for. You'd almost be better off pretending #11 was the last book. This ending simply does not do justice to the great series that EverWorld is."
3,All Good Things Must End,"Is this an excellent ending to an excellent series? Yes. Were we satisfied? No. 12 short trips to Everworld weren't enough. I don't know about everyone else but I assumed Everworld would run as long as the Animorph series. Maybe even throw in a few Chronicles here and there. All we got was 12 good books. In the long run this book was a nice way to ""wrap"" things up. But it seems the ending to it was rushed because Applegate wanted to get this series and Animorphs over with and begin on her new series."
3,Just Peters Out,"I understand all of the disappointment expressed by these reviewers. If you liked this series enough to read all of the volumes, this ending is just a whimper. If you didn't particularly care for the series and just jumped ahead to check out the ending, (like me), the weak ending doesn't come as much of a surprise.I can see how people got into these books, but boy there are a lot of books for the same reader demographic that do a much better job of creating compelling worlds, offering interesting characters, and providing a few thrills. As a teen reader looking for teen fantasy you might want to consider, (along with the obvious authors), Scott Westerfeld, or Rachel Hawkins, or Rick Yancey, or Chris Wooding."
1,what happened?,"I couldn't believe it!!! I was so looking forward to this book and when I read it I wanted to throw it across the room. It's like the author suddenly got bored with writing it, so she just stopped. NO RESOLUTION!!! She left all of the story lines dangaling in mid air and left everyone without closure. If you are planning on buying this book, I say don't. Leave it at book eleven (which was great) and save yourself the frustration."
3,"Well, it's better than the last Animorphs","This could have been a good one, but the cliffhanger ending ruins it again. Sorry, KA, but the narrator going to sleep with everything hanging is NOT AN ENDING! Actually, this series could be started again, so the ending is kind of understandable. On the good side, everyone is in character and no one is mysteriously absent, things that squandered the last Animorphs."
2,An ending?,"I will split this review into two parts: the plot and its place in the series of Everworld. First, about the plot. Hey, the story was not bad, it's just they too easily beat Hel. I dont think Hel even tried her best. That got one star off for not being exciting enough. Second and lastly, it's place in the series. This is where matters start to go bad. I think it leaves the same number of questions unanswered in our minds, if not more. Like, what actually happened to David when he was small? How did Senna turn Jalil obsessive compulsive? Who is that stopped Jalil being obsessive compulsive in Everworld? And some new ones, such as how will Christopher and Etain turn out? Will they meet the Greek gods again? And the most important question of all: How will Everworld turn out? This got two stars off. I don't think this is much like an ending."
3,not bad,"I loved the series! i tottaly agree that these books were packed with everything you could want in a book. After reading the first book i was completely hooked and i now own all tweleve. I do agree that this book does leave you hanging and waiting for more, and i was a little disappointed that it was being narrarated by April. But overall the book was okay and i liked the end, except that it is really open. Oh and for whoever gave the ending away in their review - way to go! so sorry if you read that one before you had a chance to read the book!"
1,BOOOO!!!!!,"K.A. Applegate was so dissapointing! She is good at writing books but awful at ending them! I am watching and waiting for another everworld book, but I have just about given up hope. It is overall a good book, but not a good ending to the series. To ANY series, for that matter. I hope so badly that it hurts for K.A. Applegate to make a 13th book. I also think something should happen between April and Jalil, so that is another dissapointment. So sad."
2,This is the End?,"I agree with Rebecca's review; this was very disappointing. Other than the interesting situation developing between the kids' Everworld and Earth selves, there isn't much to the book. I found it much weaker than the other books. Worse than that, about halfway through the book I began to realize, ""Applegate can't wrap up this series with only half a book to go"". If this were the penultimate book, it wouldn't be so bad; laying the groundwork for the final confrontation. But as a ""finale"", it leaves much to be desired. Especially since she could have wrapped up the general storyline, but still have left the ultimate fates of the kids open."
3,Everworld 12 leaves the Reader wondering What if ...,"Overall the book was just as entertaining as the previous 11, but it reads like it is missing the closing chapter(s). Ms. Applegate leaves the series open-ended, without an end. Perhaps she tired of writing about Everworld. Or maybe she wants Everworld fans to continue the series, like Star Trek."
3,It shouldn't be the end!,"If you ask me there needs to be another one of these books! This unsasatisfyitory ending to the series involves a meeting with an old ""friend"". They evean find someone who they didn't think would help them in any way because he once tried to kill them. April and the others are trying to set things right in EverWorld to make up for the destruction Senna and her army caused. But there are other problems coming along. Something bad is happing so that they need to make the biggest choice. Will they stay in EVerWorld or go back to their own world? Read to find out! This series defiently needs a 13th book. It kind of leaves you hanging to what they do next. So in conclusion, K.A.Applegate still needs to write the real ending to this series!"
5,Wonderful dept,"I am very pleased with tv screen enlarger. Not only that picture is bigger and can be seen from 10_15 feet clearly, but it has some kind of 3d effect with which I was amazed and enjoying movies much more that with regular screen. Now my lcd tv I wanted to buy so much, can wait for a while. Only cons is that during the day there is reflection of windows or in the evening the bulb reflection. You can still fix this by turning the light off or putting the curtains on in daylight. Phantastic product and great deal!"
4,This is also called Betsy's River Adventure,The new series called Sisters in time are the same as many American Adventure titles. This is a great story of Ameican history. Fun to read too.
4,This is where it begins,"If there was justice in the world, Gemma Hayes would be a much better known artist. As it is, hardly anyone I know has heard of her, or heard the music. But I guess that as long as there are enough fans for her to keep recording, it's all right.This quiet, acoustic EP is her first and these days a little hard to find for a reasonable price. I definitely recommend trying to do so."
5,This game is shweet,"Okay, this is one of the best-most memerable games you'll ever play. the best thing about it is staking out your ""territory"" and blocking the cops out before you start killing everyone and destroying everything. sick though it is to run down pedestrians and blow up bunches of cars-IT IS FUN! this game has good gameplay though the graphics aren't very good. one tip to anyone who hasn't played: try this game and blow up the big trucks (it's a lot of fun)."
2,Poor condition,"When we recieved the ladybug the head and wing were halfway ripped of. When I wrote the company, I never heard back. Luckily my son doesn't know the difference between a good sew job and a crappy one."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY CASES! DO NOT BUY!,"I bought several of these 10 packs. After opining one pack some of the cases just fell apart, others were cracked. Out of ten only one didn't break after being opened. The plasic is extremely thin and very flimsy and breaks as soon as you opened them.Do not buy these, look for more quality cases. The quality of these is unexeptable."
3,generic,"Found this book to be extremely generic. I was hoping for more detail and usage tips. If I had to do over, would not buy again."
5,A few years old but lot to teach,I purchased this book from Amazon in an effort to try and teach my old brain (73 yrs) a little more in the field of electronics including the equipment needed to build and check your circuits. I find the book is very good and has taught me quite a bit of information - even further than I had originally intended to get to. Many should find this book very helpful particularly in the use of oscilloscopes and associated equipment.John Weston VK3NRW
4,Great looks and sound,"I have this radio for two weeks now. I am very satisfied with the reception of AM, FM and Short Wave -- very sensitive. Has great sound. The only negative is the lack of being able to preset the stations. Would buy the radio again - worth the money."
1,"Really , Really Bad !",I bought this product for emergency use It would be great if it could pull in a station . Any Statiom well . I live between two major cities and I get much better reception on my 9V sony AM/FM 6 transitor from the 60's . Don't waist your money .
5,Beautiful Regency!,I really loved this book! Emma is a real spitfire and it is easy to see why Alex would fall for her!Wonderful writing and really engaging characters!! I love a good regency read!
2,Eh.....,Not so great. A luke warm plot. Not Julia's usual vivacious plotting. Wishy washy and plodding. Emma and Alex just don't do it for me.Read the Bridgertons instead. She really shines there.
5,By far my most favorite Julia Quinn book!,"This was an absolutely fabulous read. It was witty, romantic and unbelievably funny. Ms. Emma Dunster, a plucky and spirited American heiress, is sent to England to enjoy the London season with her cousins where she meets the much sought after, ""I will never marry"" Alexander Ridgely, the Duke of Ashbourne. Emma is determined that she will never marry an Englishman but her resolve begins to waver as she gradually loses her heart to Alex.Alex, on the other hand, is busy fighting his attraction to the beautiful Emma. However, he can't seem to stay away from her, constantly pursuing her and rescuing her from trouble. It's a definite match made in heaven.I finished this book in one night. I couldn't put it down. Ms Quinn's wonderful prose and gift in weaving such a magnificent story is simply splendid."
2,Not a good representation of JQ,"Dull, two-dimensional characters, tiresome, overly-contrived plot....not the expected Julia Quinn fare! Long-time fans and first-time readers alike, beware, this is not a book that exemplies the author's many woderful quality story-telling abilities. If you are a Brigerton fan eagerly searching for more JQ be warned. Perhaps because this was her first novel, and she had not yet hit her stride, I don't know...The other book in the series that I have read-Minx- was my first Julia Quinn, and it was wonderful, so apprently she learned quickly, but I cannot recommend this book. It was almost frustrating to read, expecially after having such high expectations from all her other novels."
3,Not a Must-Read,"I was searching for a new historical romance author, as I have already read all of the books of my favorite author, and found Julia Quinn. I wanted to start chronological with her first book. I tried to keep in mind that this was her first book published but I wasn't prepared for just how juvenile this book would be. She seemed to barely have an understanding of the Regency time period, her adult characters sounded and acted more like modern high schoolers, and the plot was weak.If you're looking for a more historically accurate, mature regency romance author, try Gaelen Foley. She's my absolute favorite.I just barely made myself finish this novel. But I haven't given up on the author yet and have a few more of her books to read."
4,"A ""Splendid"" Read...",This was the beginning for me into the world of Julia Quinn. I'm glad I found this book and the many pages of enjoyment it held! :-)
2,Yawn...,"I don't get it. I read the reviews, which were great, and decided to try a new author and I'm so disappointed. This book was just plain boring. Emma was very appealing, but gave up her supposedly lifelong dream at the slightest resistance. Alex was just plain uninteresting and nobody a normal woman would be fascinated by. I would have liked to see her get him to move to America, instead of the other way around. I felt like the story just sort of petered out. I won't be tempted by this author again."
3,Not her best,"I usually love Julia Quinn's books but this one just seemed like such fluff. I felt like the characters didnt have much depth to them. Supposedly Emma wanted to run her fathers company but she seemed to have given up that dream rather quickly. She's suppose to be a strong woman but she let the hero bulldoze her. On top of that, she let him take liberties waaayyy too many times and almost from the very beginning. I like Alpha men but not when it seems like he doesn't respect the heroine. I just kept thinking that this wouldn't be happening in this time period.There was some good moments in the book. I actually was more excited about Dunford's character. All in all, I've read better works from her."
1,Terribly Disappointing,"For those who have not read any other Julia Quinn novels, don't take this as the norm. This book lacks her normal humour, relatively strong female characters and some semblance of a plot. This novel was appalling and I am glad to see that it is one of her first novels not her later ones."
5,Terrific,"After reading all of Julia Quinn's later books, I was thrilled when ""Splendid"" and ""Dancing at Midnight"" were re-released. Both her earlier novels are definitely worth reading. The characters involved in them will be familiar to readers who have read ""Minx"". Emily is a terrific American heroine: intelligent, spirited, independent and witty. Alex is less vividly portrayed, but - although his violent mood swings are a little hard to understand - he finally shows enough love, loyalty and strength to satisfy the reader that he is worth Emily's love. Tender and poignant at times and hilarious in others, ""Splendid"" is a great romance and a must-read for lovers of the genre."
3,Pretty much 3.5 stars!,"Splendid is the first book of this trilogy: Splendid, Dancing at Midnight and Minx (plus a short story about Ned in the anthology ""Where's My Hero""). It is also Julia Quinn's first novel! She wrote this in her early 20's and while the story is excellent, he execution is not as polished as her other novels. By the time Dancing at Midnight was published Quinn had a much better grasp of British English and Regency diction, etc. I do really really like the book, and Quinn is a natural story teller! Read it to start the series but know that it will only get better! Her other series are great as well, especially the Bridgerton series (which is my favorite)"
3,"Lovely moments, or should I say splendid?","Okay, so this is a fluffy romance novel, pretty friendly, and the women are in charge of their own destinies. Yadda yadda. I really like the humor, and having read later Julia Quinn books - I can see where she is going. However, I have one thing to add to the numerous other reviews: what happened to the dog? The dog jumps out of the boy's arms and runs across the street, starting a series of very important events - but what happens to the dog? Is he okay? I know that perhaps at the time that this book took place people didn't have the close personal relationships with their pets that we have now, however, the dog is never again addressed, and let's face it: feminists like this wouldn't move through the world of the book as successfully as they do (I only mention the second part to point out that one might expect a modern person's need to understand the pet's fate...). I liked the book, and would read it again, but the dog thing is a subtle itch."
2,Not Splendid...,"What happened??? I could barely get through this one! I can't for the life of me figure out how Quinn can write a book like ""When He Was Wicked"" (which is one of the best books I've ever read) and then have a novel like this in her name. I'm simply dumbfounded. Well on to her next one...I'm on a mission to like her work again!"
3,Maybe 3 1/2,I liked this story. I love to see a strong female in the lead. I really liked Emma. This book also has strong supporting characters. Some of the plot line tended to drag & I probably would have cut some of it out but over-all it is a lighthearted romance with likeable people. This was not my first time to read it & if I had written a review after the first reading I probably would have scored it higher. After several years of reading these types of novels I find myself feeling like I am reading the same story over & over. Still it was enjoyable & a lot better than some I have read.
2,Not up to standard,I have read almost all of Julia Quinns novels but this one just lacked something. Not much of a plot or story to draw me in.
5,Great Book!!!,Julia's writing is Splendid indeed. This story is about an american girl who falls in love with a never going to marry Duke. Funny. Could not put it down!
1,Oh help me please! This book was so cliche.,"After having read the ""Duke and I"", I searched for some more Julia Quinn novels. I found ""Splendid"". There was nothing splendid about it. (Please pardon the cliche!) I think it is very sad when an author attempts to write a story with silly cliches simply to fill the pages. Its also a sad testimony to romance readers when an author thinks we will be happy with just any old story-line. Please we need some better story-lines and authentic characters. I am so upset with this purchase, I also have ""Dancing at Midnight"" left to read. I am not looking forward to it, but I don't want to waste my money, I will force myself through it."
5,A book that lives up to it's title,"This story truly was splendid! Julia Quinn created wonderful characters with Emma Dunster and Alex Ridgely. They were charming and funny. After reading all the favorable reviews I had to order it, and it was well worth the wait."
5,A Truly SPLENDID Read,I've recently discovered Ms. Quinn and have set out to buy and read everyone of her novels. This one had me practically falling off the chair with laughter. I'm glad I was in my home as I am sure I would have caused quite a sight if I'd been reading this in public.American Heiress meets a confirmed bachelor of a Duke. The pages just sizzle at the spontaneous combustion these two make when thrown together.Romance just doesn't get much better than this. A truly SPLENDID read!
2,Definitely an Early Effort,"Julia Quinn has come a long way as an author. If you like her Bridgerton books, skip this early effort. Some nice plot points, but the characters are one dimensional, and the same adjectives seem to be used ad nauseum."
1,why not set the book in America?,"This book should be titled 'Dire' or 'Dreadful'. What is the point of setting a book in London if the dialogue and description are pure American. I love American romantic fiction, I think Jayne Anne Krentz is without equal, so why didn't this Author set her book in America. It is irritating and distracting to have so-called English characters using American English. A little research would cure the problem, witness Amanda Quick, and make the reading far more enjoyable. I gave this book one star because there isn't a no star option."
2,Save Your Money,"If you just like buying books for the heck of it, then reconsider buying this one. This book doesn't seem to cover the topics that would be very useful. Some topics which required further detail were not mentioned whereas those which did not need attention were given MORE than what they deserved.I had this book for a few years now and I still kick myself for buying it when I did because it's just plain BLAH. It's not interesting reading material. For once, the Unleashed books by Sam disappointed me.Don't take this as a bad sign. There's a LOT of SAM Publishing books which are great, just not this one.By the way, look at when this book was published and how many reviews there have been thus far. It'll give you an idea whether to get the book or not."
2,Beginners beware,Entered the code example in chapter 5 and couldn't compile it - that's as far as I got with the book before I gave up. This book needs a website.
2,Quality Control Department is MIA,"I received the item in the time allotted for shipping. The problem is that there is a hole in the muffler located at the inlet end on the facing plate. The welds do not look very good either - I have seen better welds performed by hand. You would expect a product like this to be manufactured much better than this! Returning it would cost me more money, if they were serious about the quality - they would guarantee the product return shipping cost in case of defects. I have not installed the item yet so I am not sure on the fit. I wish I could give it a better review but I can't. I would like to upload pictures but it only has a video review tab. And as others have said the stickers are stuck on the muffler like a 3 year old went loose with the sticker roll."
1,Cutsey characterizations -- too cliché,"I just became aware of this book recently and it was heartbreaking to read. It seemed like a mockery of my wonderful late father who was one of the kindest, most sensitive, loving, honest and intelligent men I have ever known.It's clear the author had only a superficial acquaintance with my dad, but that didn't stop her from using him in a cutesy characterization that had little to do with reality. It was clearly a marketing ploy, and should not have been presented as non-fiction."
4,Beyond Rhetoric and Emotions,"As someone who is Christian and sympathetic to the difficulties of transgendered and homosexual people, I found the book to be of great help wrestling through the issues. Although a bit difficult to read, it provides interesting discussion questions at the end of each chapter for groups study."
5,This is a great shoe!,"I bought these shoes about four months ago and I only wear them when I play racquetball. After a lot of use they are still in perfect shape, they have great grip and are really light. I consider myself a beginner at racquetball, but one thing is for sure; once I got these shoes it definitely stepped up my game. Id recommend these shoes to anyone."
3,Hmmmm.........nah,"This could of been a really good cd if you like punk. But no they had to taint it with the likes of rap and heavy metal. The Rancid, Nofx, and Pennywise songs are all awesome. Too bad they were wasted on such a loser cd."
4,"Super Cute, but...","I think these are super cute and a great deal because of the price, but they are not the most comfy sandals. My sister bought a pair at the store and I bought two. She got 2 blisters, one between her toes and one at the back of her feet. i got one at the back of my feet. They don't feel terrible though, maybe just some getting used to. All in all, i think they are still adorable !"
2,Love them!,"I meant to give it a five stars but for some reason it showed two. Anyways, I just simply love these sandals they are very confortable and light. One recomendation that I find it helpful is when you buy thong sandals make sure that you order a size bigger so they don't fit very thight on your foot and create blisters between your toes."
2,"Cute, but","These are cute sandals, but there is not much to them. Just a piece of leather for the sole and the top. I am sending them back because they don't seem even worth the sale price I paid for them. I am afraid a person could feel every tiny pebble on the ground through the thin soles and that they wouldn't last long at all."
3,Pretty cold,"This is kind of a swizz really as it says ""Mike Mignola"" on the cover and is how I came to discover this book but Mignola's contribution is a single wordless page of a drawing of a vampire. Out of 48 pages. There are quite a few of these 1 page contributions in between 4 page comics about a vampire doing something.Bryan Talbot's 4 page strip is by far the best. Not just gory as hell but an interesting final page which, in my opinion, could easily be a series unto itself so long as Talbot writes/draws it. Also Joann Sfar's comic is ok, an amusing pastiche of ""Batman"" meeting a vampire.Overall though I'd say this is quite missable as a read. Some interesting bits and pieces but hardly a good anthology on vampires and very slight."
1,It pains me to listen to this,"I have to agree with girlpowernazi on this tour completely sucking and the Union Street CD sucking as well, minus a couple of moving tracks that don't remotely translate well live at all. I love all of erasure's music and disagree with their past couple albums being tripe, because I love their electronic music and even love some of their past acoustic renditions but with the fake country twang; it just sounds forced. I lived in the south for eight years and actually enjoy old school country, Tammy Wynette, Weyland Jennings, Conway Twitty, but this actually sounds like an offensive homage to that genre. It takes a true fan to be able to face the truth, and I have seen every tour since they toured with Duran Duran for the Circus Tour, and loved every tour, especially Swan, Tank, and Balloon live at the Beacon theatre....they sold out a good 13 shows in a row while I was going to Pratt back in the early 90's. Road to Nashville bites, it actually pains me to listen to it."
1,"IF YOU LIKE THIS, YOU ARE A DIE-HARD FAN","I enjoy Erasure's music, and I've bought quite a few tripe records of theirs in recent years simply to see what they do next. But c'mon, guys, you've got to draw the line somewhere. Union Street was bad enough, but the live show was just a dreadful embarrassment. I've heard junior high school bands play in better time than this tossed-together touring band that clearly would have rather been elsewhere. And these arrangements . . . ugh.If you must, download a track or two. If you haven't heard enough acoustic versions of Spiraling to last you a life time, the version here is fun. If you buy this album, you are clearly a true-blue, dyed-in-the-wool Erasure fan. Anyone but the utmost completist should take a pass."
4,"Not too bad, but should be a lot better as it's their 2nd","This album doesn't really live up to what Who is, This is? had, but there are some pretty kick ass songs. Shoot the Moon, Charlie Brown, Drunk Tank, Trouble Walking, Give Me Someone I Can Trust, Empty Bottles, Malas Palabras, and Land of Misfit Toys are the only ones I can bare listen to, although some of them aren't really that great. The rest just don't live up to the standards. The great ones do make up for them, so this album is still worth buying."
3,Teddy Opaque Body Suit,"Teddy was very comfortable and form fitting, but rather delicate and appears that it could snag easily, but hasn't yet."
1,Another bad bodysuit!,"Bodysuit was falling apart at the seams when out of the package. Scratchy, uncomfortable and the poorest quality. Too cheap to go to the trouble of returning."
1,Never received!,"I am still waiting for these items. Amazon is supposed to be crediting my money. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. No returned calls or emails, and no merchandise. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!"
3,what happened?,"well, just let me say that i love nofx, but this album really let me down. granted, there are some good songs on it, but it's all so damned slow and weak. thank god ""so long and thanks for all the shoes"" was back to the good old nofx, but their best album remains ""white trash, 2 heebs, and a bean."" heavy petting zoo just didn't cut it for me."
4,this is my favorite NOFX cd. slower but still fast & hard.,"this is a typical nofx record, howev, they slow things down a little....which allows for a little more of the groove vibe. almost as good as gob."
2,Don't buy it,"It sucks, its slow, and why buy this album when all the others are fast and fun to listen to. Punk fan from houston"
2,The Begining of the End!,"Well NoFX has been around for quite a while, and they have put out a ton of great albums. But now they're fading away and this might be there last decent album. Don't get me wrong the albums after this arn't terrible but NoFX has changed.This album is a lot lighter and slower than anything NoFx put out prier to 1995. In my opinion it's not as good. There are no stand out tracks and I find myself skipping tracks constantly. Since this effort every album following this is also not that good. It seems like it's missing something, there is hardly any energy in this. It is sort of like this album was made in a week.Overall this album isn't a complete waiste. It's good on a rare occasion. Go ahead and pick this up but it's quite different"
1,this Cd had NOFX on me,"The music basically is like any other album by this band, skillfully performed but not skillfully written. The music simply has no appeal, the chord progressions don't interest me. They make the Sex Pistols look good if you ask me, though of course thousands of people insist on liking them even though they have NO SKILLPunk rock musts are listed belowEarly Green DayThe OffspringSum 41PennywiseRancid"
3,I'm not most impressed with this one,"I have actually owned this album for quite some time, i'd say about 6 years or so and its O.K. The only real song that stands out to me is Hobophobic. The others, they don't seem to stand out too much and are kinda mellow compared to the album directly before and after it. I'm not saying that it's a bad album, its just that most of the whole album doesn't feel very punk to me except for the first song, which is completely different from the rest of the album!"
5,The Grunge NOFX album,"Many people don't realize it, but this album came out in the middle of the grunge era, or maybe it was toward the end, I kinda forget. I do remember that NOFX wanted to make an alternative rock record, and this is the end result: Technical brilliance, smarmy and offbeat irony, ear catching poetry thanks to Fat Mike, and a handful of songs which cry out ""Punk never really died.""My favorite track is the screeching feedback, nirvana-esque song ""whats the matter with kids today"", a serious sounding title fit to a hillariously opposite song. This is NOFX irony writ large. If my memery serves me, this is like the sequel to an older song with a similar title that was serious, possibly on White Trash 2 Heebs and a Bean. Then they did ""whats the matter with parents today"" on pump up the valuum"".In summary, go buy this album NOW, you'll thank yourself later."
3,its ok...,"This CD definitely hits the brakes 2 yrs. after Punk In Drublic. It's probably the most serious NOFX CD there is, and definitely the slowest overall. Good melodys and good moments, but not as happy as the other albums."
5,Ive listend to this cd a few times and...,One song on the cd is worth buying it for but you get the bonus of all the rest of the songs. And that song is Drop The World.That is the all time greatest song. But the rest of the album is also prety good. The reason it sounds different from there other albums is because it was recorded in russia (thats what it said on there site).
4,its cool....i guess,"this ones ok. it could be better for a 96' NOFX cd. im warning its mostly slow punk rock wutch is ok but just not very good NOFX. im not sayne its not a good cd. its pretty good. if you get it, play #11 right away(whatever didi wants). pick it up pick it up. (dont go near the MXPX section. vady vady poopy band. there like the hanson of punk rock. they mock us in a way we dont need."
5,Very Impressive,"This book by author and journalist Bob Pratt gives us a good view and explanation of what hapens in the North and Northeast of Brazil. Facts presented in the book show that, if we are being visited by alien beings, they are not always good as some people think. A good field research done by this experienced Ufologist."
5,GearGrip Lite,"This computer carrying case is a life saver. I have a job in which I have to take my desktop workstation with me to various places and this thing saves my hands from being cut up my sharp edges of my computer case. The carrying case makes it a lot easier to carry large towers with one hand and you don't have to worry about it slipping as this thing is easy to hold. If you go to LAN parties or have a job that requires you to work onsite with your desktop computer, this product is a must."
5,other uses too,I made a little mod to this item and converted it in to a LCD monitor carrier. It worked out great. Better than spending $60 for about the same item different name.
2,little bit flimsy,These work great but i broke on on day two of using it. It was the plastic clip that broke.
5,Best Millencolin CD,"If you don't have this cd, get it. I've had it for years, and it's still one of my favorites..."
5,"Millencolin- ""Life On A Plate""","Okay, so your interested in buying this cd? If you are, you have to buy it. Millencolin is one of my favorite bands, and this is some of their best work. The songs that are especially good on this cd are track #1 called ""Bullion,"" and track #11 called ""Softworld."" Don't get me wrong, the whole cd is good, I mean, Millencolin does not write bad songs it's just that some songs are better then others. Well, I hope you buy it, and for those of you that aren't real familiar with punk, I will recommend some other bands to get you started. They are: Descendents, Good Riddance, Jughead's Revenge, Strung Out, and Bigwig. Well, I hope my recommendations help you. Bye"
2,Not her best work,"I've read all of P.D. James's mysteries and Original Sin is by far her weakest effort. It's slow and unimaginative compared to her previous works. The characters and the mystery itself aren't compelling and the only reason I kept reading was because I was sure Ms. James wouldn't do this to her readers. But she did! I hope new readers don't pick this up and think it's indicative of her work. If it's your first James, try ""An Unsuitable Job For a Woman,"" a far superior work."
2,Well written but tedious,"This is my 3rd PD James book and I have to say I was quite disappointed. (The other 2 were Murder Room and A Certain Justice.)I found most of the characters to be not terribly believable and one dimensional. Even Dalgliesh was not well drawn.And to make it worse, the plot was not believable.I agree with someone else who said borrow this from the library, don't buy it."
2,Tedious,"I usually enjoy P.D. James books and this one has a promising start with the description of Innocent House and the Thames. However, I wish I hadn't persevered to the end. There was zero reward. Narrative only lost momentum. Only interesting note was the aged mystery-writer character, finally let go by her publisher, only to be murdered. Even then, the chance that Dame James was saying something about running out of ideas was painful in a large book which took much more time than warranted."
3,"Great setting, disappointing denouement","For once one of James's elaborate architectural fantasias seems both exciting and appropriate, and the mock-Venetian splendour of Innocent House adds a wonderful Gothic atmosphere to ORIGINAL SIN. Gerard Etienne is a superb murder victim--so utterly loathesome you come to wonder why anyone hasn't killed him long ago--and many of the suspects are wonderfully complex and even (in the case of Frances Peverell) wholly sympathetic--the latter instance must be a first for James.But the novel's denouement is a real disappointment. The reason for Gerard's murder is pretty hokey, and doesn't seem to be very much ""a piece"" with the rest of the novel. And the resolution of the Daniel aaron subplot comes out of nowhere. James's next novel, A CERTAIN JUSTICE, has a far more satisfying plot and resolution."
2,Monumental but off target (maybe),"Warning: Handling this book can cause bodily injury. Consult a doctor if you have previously had joint or muscle problems. Part of the size and weight of this book is due to the English/German/French translation, which triples the text area. This is a custom typical of Continental European art&design publications, whose readership usually knows no other language than their native one (note--I'm from Italy and I speak from experience). Personally, I would have preferred a book 30% smaller and lighter, with more actual information inside. Oh, and about the content: the ""Who's Who"" section, which represents the bulk of the book, does not mention D. B. Updike or Francis Meynell! Here we have a problem of defining the field. If you are interested in graphics design, this book is definitely for you. If you care about TYPOGRAPHY, defined as the art of designing and manufacturing printed pages, well, go read something else."
3,Half and Half,This movie is a collection of 30 min videos. Some of them are very interesting and others are not quite what i expected. A few of them have very little climbing in them so if you like your climbing videos with all out climbing all the time this isn't your movie set. The stories are very good though so if you dig a movie with climbing in it then this is a good set to pick up.
2,Required Reading,"Well, this book was required for the course I am taking - so it wasnt my choosing. I think that the book is far more biased that I am used to for a textbook. It expressed the author's opinions far more than giving concrete facts on the subject and I often dissagreed with the view points that the material presented."
2,"So, so disappointing","I bought this for my husband as part of his Christmas present. I expected to receive a magazine. Instead it was a 16 page leaflet with holes punched in it ready to go in a file. Four of the pages are just links and information about other books and guides to buy which are about California. The paper is not nice quality and the whole thing is just black and white.Very, very disappointed"
1,The Offspring Could of Done Better,"THIS CD SUCKES. If you didn't listen to any other Offspring album, you'd probebly like this album. I LOVE the offspring. I would give all there cd's expet this one 5 stars. There missing something in this album. If you like Amercana and Smash DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"
2,this is oooookaaaaay,"okay, bottom line, if you like ixnay and smash, you have a good chance of not liking this, it's nothing like them. i will admit, it does have some very good tracks, but others just really really really S U C K! so, if you like ignition, this would be a good cd, but for those of you that didn't like ignition, i wouldn't get this"
5,Adrenalin pumping CD,"This is their first album and maybe their best.All songs are brilliant especially Blackball and Tehran.The music is theirbest ever,and the lyrics although a little dark,are strong andpowerfull.If you are a true Offspring fan you must have thisCD,and if you don't then go buy it right now!!"
5,Classic album,"The offsprings first is the best album ive ever heard the standout tracks are definetley Jennifer Lost The War, I'll be waiting and Blackball. This album really shows Ron Weltys drumming really progressing but Dexter vocals are the real stand out along with Noodles guitar work. This a must for every offspring fan"
2,One strong song. Period.,"This album has three songs worth mentioning. Jennifer Lost the War is some of they're best work ever.(To me it ranks up with Smash, Gone Away, Self Esteem and genocide.) The next best ssong is Tehran wich is entertaining but somewhat lacking. Then there's elders wich grows old fast. The rest of the record is deviod of merit. Had Jennifer Lost the War been released as a single, it may have achieved the recognition it deserves but as it is, the song is weighed down by the rest of the record. I got this on vinyl for $6 and it was definately worth it, but I don't know that I'd pay the full $12 for the CD."
4,i dont like punk but this is great,"this album is pretty good i must admit i had low expectations when i bought it because ignition was pretty dodgy and i though this would be simmiler its not tho its quite good great lyrics and catchy lyrics make it a worthwhile album to buy if u like punk rockstand out tracks: Jenifer lost the war,elders i'll be waiting, black ball"
3,"Fresh, raw but not there best work","A good beginning album, but it lacks the polish and definition of the more recent works. A couple of very enjoyable songs are dragged down by (a few) songs that are really rather silly. If you want to here pre-commertial Offspring buy 'Ignition'."
4,An awesome start,"Ah, the Offspring at its early days. This is a great album, and has a classic sound. It is not as good as their more mature albums, but hey, I could never live without hearing the song, ""Beheaded"". A great CD, but if this is your first time with the Offspring, opt to buy Smash or Ixnay on the Hombre."
5,THIS IS SWEET!!,"This is an awesome album. Jennifer Lost the War is one of their best songs. They have awesome guitar, drums, and vocals. In a simpler way, they have awesome music. This Album is SWEET!! They are my favorite band and they are going ALL THE WAY!!!"
4,"Not their best, a good beginning.","The Offspring are my favorite band, and I own all 5 albums (though I have yet to see them live). This album is not the best in my opinion, and is actually my least favorite (Ixnay On The Hombre being my favorite, followed by Smash, Americana, Ignition, and this) but it is still noteworthy. The obvious highlights/standouts of this album are Jennifer Lost The War, Beheaded, Tehran, and I'll Be Waiting, and the only real flaw on this album is that the rest of the songs sound pretty much the same. Still, the lyrics are meaningful (which is to be expected from the Offspring) and Noodle's lead work is right up to par. All in all a decent recording. P.S. Does anybody else notice that Dexter's voice sounds very different on this album?"
3,It's OK,"The self titled album is not bad. With songs like Jennifer lost the War and Crossroads, this album is pretty good. However, in the general sense of things, this album is ok. Most of the songs are tolerable. It's not something that is worth the $ that much, but if you're a big fan of punk rock, get it."
1,Horrible product!,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased! Pay ~$17 for (2) pieces of foam that are supposed to stick to the sides of an A/C unit with double-sided tape or glue. WRONG! The tape sticks to nothing (peels off/away within seconds). The only thing worthwhile about the package - is the foam, - but I would not pay $17."
3,satisfied customer,good product .would purchase agin.easy install. delivery was easy.would recommend to family.would like different color selections to easily go with the room color.
4,Fire in the Dark,"I am a huge fan of Lindsay Wagner, and I think Olympia Dukakis is a fantastic actress. They both did a great job in FIRE IN THE DARK--especially Ms. Dukakis. If I didn't know better, I would have thought the actress had gone to the Great Theatre in the Sky the minute the director yelled, ""Cut! That's a wrap."" The only reason I didn't give this movie 4 stars is because it feels dated. Compared to the movies of today, it is paced a little slowly. Even so, I sympathized with both characters. I felt their every frustration and their every fear. I even shed a few tears. If you are a fan of either of these actresses, or if you know someone going through the trials and tribulations of growing old and frail, it is worth adding to your collection."
4,In search of Sacajawea,"Arapaho attorney Vicki Holden has a reunion with an old friend when Laura Simmons appears on the Wind River Reservation to do research on Sacajawea. Laura is following in the footsteps of another investigator who came to the reservation 20 years earlier and who disappeared. When a skeleton is unearthed which proves to be the first investigator, Vicky and her friend, Father John, decide that Laura may be in danger. This book contains themes of domestic abuse and alcoholism which occur on the reservation and which tie the stories of the two investigators to that of Sacajawea. The story gets a little slow at times, but the continuing attraction between the unlikely pair of priest and female attorney keeps things interesting."
3,Traveler in Time,"Scajawea, the mystery woman of the Lewis and Clark expedition: Were her memories of the trip recorded? Legend says they were, but were destroyed in a fire. A young archaeologist claimed to have discovered it then disappeared. Now a friend of Vickie Holden's comes to the Wind River Reservation to follow the tracks left behind by this missing woman.A skeleton which proves to be the missing woman leads both Vickie and Father John to fear for the safety of the new researcher. The killer may strike again to cloak his identity.Vickie strives to find the answers while dealing with her memories of an abusive husband that drove her from her home and the rejection of her own people for stepping outside a woman's traditional place.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,"Good, but not great.","Although this book is good, I felt that it spent too much of the book describing scuba-diving, and how it worked, etc., etc. The plot was simple, perhaps too simple, and the ending quite predictable.However, it was not in any way horrible, and I enjoyed reading it."
5,Read this as a teen.,Read this as a teenager. I just had to buy it again. Enjoyed it so much the first time. Still just as good now as an adult.
3,"GOOD, BUT THAT IT","I read this book when i was in grade 6, and i recently read it again. I think the book is enjoyable but it drags on. There is too much detail about the scuba divers and the lessons, it gets boring. I recommend this book to anybody under the age of 13, its not a difficult read and the story is very simple to follow."
4,Mystery,"I thought that Bury Me Deep was a really good book. I would say this book is along the line of a triller and mystery book. I would recomend this book for young teenage girls. I liked it a lot and I never got bored with the book, like I do with some others. I thought this book was interesting and it had a surprise ending to the whole mystery.It's mainly about a girl,Jean, and her friends who go to Hawaii for a Sring vacation. And when thay get there they end up with a mystery to solve. Enjoy your reading! :)"
4,COOL,"not as great as his usual books, but its ok, a bit predictable. i think pike was at his best during THE MIDNIGHT CLUB, FINAL FRIENDS TRILOGY, & CHAINLETTER"
3,Jean is going on vacation in Hawaii and witnesses a death,"Jean must help the boy (Mike), whom she saw die on board the plane to Hawaii, find his murderer before they kill again."
5,"I thouht the others were great, but this one was the BOMB!!","It had a great story line, some romance, and a lot of action. Eveyone should read it and love it the way I did. This is one book I felt like I could connect with. If I had to choose one book to read over and over, it would be this one."
4,One of his best I've read!,"""Bury Me Deep"" is an exciting book about a normal Californiagirl who takes a vacation with her friend to Hawaii. On theplane over she meets a handsome boy, but she doesn't knowthat he is actually dead!There is a lot more to the book than that, I can assureyou! The part that most impressed me was the suspense! I lovedit. It is also one of Pike's ""psycho bad guy novels."" Thebad guy really is crazy, but I think it makes for a goodcharacter.The characters are all strong, but the book itself isn'tvery well written. That doesn't mean it isn't good, oh no!It has an ingenius plot, and is overall a thrilling page-turner."
5,how could you NOT like this?,"this CD is great. i don't see how any punk fan couldn't like it. Dave Smalley kicks some major booty, with a great and always recognizable voice. the band is just FUN. *check out their ""Last of the Sharpshooters"" CD too."
3,punk fan,"independence day, superman, ivory girl and radio ragga, are really cool songs but the rest of them sound the same. So this is a good cd but not great."
2,New version worse,"I have used this numbered thermometer for over 10 years. It started out blue, then black and now yellow. The blue and black held up to heat well. I averaged using them over 2 years.(Always bought 3 at a time) I've had the yellow ones about a month and I'll be lucky to get 6 months out of them.(The head sags where it meets the shaft) My equip operates at 400 F plus, so if you are at lower temps you might be OK. The temp mechanism works fine. The thermometer changed completely in the fall of 2010. Any reviews before that is for a different thermometer."
2,Battery cover broke after a couple of months,"For the money I'd expect a little more quality. I've had to tape the cover back on. Overall the thermometer was a little disappointing. It takes about 5-10 seconds to get a stable reading. It's not exactly instant read, but it seems accurate. The min and max memory is useful, but they are a little tedious to reset. On the plus side, the auto-off feature is nice since it save batteries.Sept 9, 2011 Update: I've long since thrown away this thermometer. If anyone is looking for a much better instant read thermometer, look at the ThermoWorks Splash-Proof Super-Fast Thermapen - Instant Read Thermometer. It is available on Amazon for $93. I realize it's almost 4 times as expensive, but after using it for a couple of years now I strongly believe that it is a decision you will not regret."
3,Not an instant-read. Very slow,"I should have read the description better. Taylor does not describe this as an instant read. Also checkout their site, [...], model 9878. Only amazon's offical description writer described it as instant read. I doubt they even used it.I had a Taylor waterproof thermometer in yellow. It wasn't so waterproof and broke after a year so I decided to buy this. I had no issues with the cheaper yellow one's speed in reading temps. It was an instant read.This one however is very slow. For the money, I thought it would be quicker than their cheaper line. I've never timed it but it seems like 10+ seconds to get a read. I'll probably get a Thermapen or go back and buy the cheaper yellow one and be more careful with it around water. I don't like standing there with the oven door, grill cover, etc open for 10 seconds while the temp is being taken.."
3,mmmm,"its a good termometer the problem its that its a little slow, and the power button broke after a couple of uses so now its not waterproof"
5,"How to Think Theologically, 2nd Edition",This book lays the groundwork for understanding how to think through difficult issues pertaining to the Bible. It helps you understand how conflict occurs in churches because of bad theology.
4,How we think theologically,"This book is a good exposition of how people come to think theologically, how it affects their behaviors and how one can move forward from there. Good read."
2,Pretty darned bad.,"The actors weren't all that bad, but the overall quality of the movie was. It's a little hard to say what exactly Hollywood has to do to make a quality movie, but whatever it is, this one didn't have it. It being unrealistic was just one part of the badness. In one scene, for example, the guys land on the beach--and they're supposed to be the best of the best--and you can see somebody else running up along the beach on the side, but none of them see him...until I guess they got to the cue spot in the sand...""Hey! Who goes there!"" Parts like that are almost funny. I could tell after about three minutes that it was wasted money but I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes."
1,"Pure dreck, avoid at all cost","Thankfully, only $1.28 was wasted at Redbox. I must admit that I ceased viewing this movie after about 15 minutes, although I fast-forwarded to the end.Just an awful, cheap,inaccurate attempt at moviemaking. In the first scene, we see a small group of U.S. soldiers, and a ""Sicilian"" guide on the beach, led by a captain in the 101st Airborne, who did not see action until Normandy in June, 1944, yet this is supposedly Sicily in July, 1943!Also, the captain was overweight, and appeared to be about 55-60 years old! Some paratrooper!When this old soldier was captured by the Germans, the inevitable heinous, black -uniformed SS officer shows up, to interrogate/torture him. Yeah, right!This abysmal film is on par with science fiction movies produced by the SyFY channel, with the same type of laughable production ""values.""I wish I could rate with minus stars!"
1,"The Absolute Worst, Absolutely","This, by far, is the worst war movie I have ever had the misfortune to watch. To add salt to this festering wound, I actually paid a rental fee for this debacle. I can only pity the person who claims to have seen something worst than ""Battle Force"".It blows my mind to think that someone actually read the script and thought it was worth producing; that someone previewed the production cuts and thought it was worth continuing; and that someone saw the final product and thought it was worth releasing. Truly unbelievable."
4,"Good overview of ""common sense"" dating advice.","While this book is put out by a Christian publisher it is not overly religious, but the kind of advice you would receive from a wise friend on how to take relationships slowly and prudently to prevent common dating and relationship disasters. It gives good examples from psychology literature and samples of actual relationship experiences."
1,An EP worth forgetting...,"Thank god I heard it online before I bought it. This isn't worth the CD it's burned on. Very poor music quality and even poorer vocals. If it were free, take it. Otherwise, spend your money on a new hat."
5,Great Cover For Your Truck,Excellent cover! Very nice high quality trap. Easy installation 20-25 min. Would Buy Again!!
4,Love's Abiding Joy,Loved this movie....Nice to see there are still movies being made that illustrate character and christian values.
2,Loves Abiding Joy,The whole Love Comes Softly series is just great! Our family views them over and over because they have such excellent life messages.
5,They keep getting better!,I have watched every movie in this series and I must say that with each new release they get better and better. Thanks much for producing excellent family entertainment that is above reproach.
5,Love's Abiding Joy - Great Entertainment!!,"It is hard to find good quality, wholesome movies these days. This movie has great actors, great plot and is great family entertainment. Highly recommend."
4,"not 19th century, but well worth watching","This movie was a good finish to the 4-part series. While it placed some 20th and 21st century values in a 19th century setting, it's a wholesome movie with a good message...do what's right, even though it may affect your friends because right is right. I think Dale Midkiff's character (Clark Davis)kept things on track for the family in this film."
1,don't judge the book by the movie,"I love Janette Oke's book and particularly the Love Comes Softly series. I watched the first one with much anticipation, but was very disappointed. I watched the next two hoping they would get better, but they got worse. This one was the worst, yet.I only got about 20 minutes into the movie and had to turn it off because they had already botched the storyline so badly. I cannot believe Janette Oke is letting them do this to her books.Please don't judge the book by the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the book. The books are wonderful."
3,And So Job Died .......,"First of all, let me say, that I love this series of movies. They are very well done with great messages about real life problems and issues. However, I cannot agree with the other viewers in regards to this particular movie. I found that the beginning of this movie was soooooo depressing that there wasn't anyway it could possibly recover. I cried and cried some more. I think there are other ways to bring about the good messages of God's love than just through adversities. Now having said that, I would love to see more movies like this, albiet with more of a positive, uplifting content."
2,Worst of the four...,"The actors that portray Willie & Missy LeHaye were really mismatched. There's a bond more like sister & brother. No chemistry.This installment had no suspsense, no romance, and worst of all it was very boring and depressing.A nice trilogy, but #4 doesn't seem to belong.The actress who plays Missy looks too old for the role, especially for the actor who portrays Willie LeHaye. I liked her better in the 3rd installment, where she had more spirit and was younger looking.The kids had very small roles, the foster son's role was a yawner.Missy's father showing up, and Willie LeHaye's acting were the only redeeming qualities of the film. The actor who portrayed the former preacher-turned rancher, was also notable and memorable."
4,Much better than the last one ....,"I just viewed this movie and found it much better than the last installment, ""Love's Long Journey"" -- This had a more heart-wrenching story that made me teary and held my interest as much as my first favorite, Love Comes Softly (the best of the 4) -- Even if Love's Abiding Joy doesn't turn out to be your favorite of the 4, it's at least worth watching as it's getting harder & harder to find decent entertainment anymore ... I think you'll like it ... I did."
2,Profanity,We purchased this 4th movie because the first 3 had no curse words but there is on instance of the H*** word in this movie which was a dissappointment to me.
3,Poor Packaging,"The product itself is exactly what I expected. However, as a roll product, I expected it would have been packaged in a cardboard tube to protect it in transit. Instead, it was packaged in a cellophane sleeve only and put into a triangular shaped shipping ""tube"" box. It bounced around inside the box and the edges were crushed upon arrival."
1,Don't bother,"Unless you are in middle school, don't bother. A very poor attempt -- he either forgot or never knew."
1,He forgot it all,"This reader lost interest when the writer called his controls in a B-17 a ""steering wheel."" The author, a WWII pilot of a B-17, obviously didn't keep a diary or even his official records, so he wings it in this memoir. It is so vague as to be embarrassing, and includes general statements that could be made by a writer that had not left the United States. In addition, the proofing is awful, to the point where the author's last name is spelled two ways throughout."
5,"The ultimate triumph of ""the greatest generation""","Candidly written by Charles Alling (a pilot of the 8th Air Force and recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters during World War II), A Mighty Fortress: Lead Bomber Over Europe is a personal memoir of the final months of World War II when Alling was flying B-17s in combat over Germany. Harrowing danger, the heroic and strenuous efforts of a coordinated flight crew, the horrors of war, and the ultimate triumph of ""the greatest generation"" fill this captivating autobiography from beginning to end. A Mighty Fortress is highly recommended reading and a welcome addition to the growing Military History library of World War II eye-witness memoirs and autobiographies."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I bought 2 of these blankets (one red the other blue) because of the ""great"" deal that was being offered at the time. I purchased the king sized blankets and when they arrived I really liked the look and feel of them. However, they do not stand up. They shed feathers at an alarming rate. The blanket will keep you warm, but I'm not sure if it's worth buying."
3,It would be perfect except....,"It leaks feathers like a sieve. tiny little down feathers that I am probably inhaling all through the night, why do I still sleep with it? Because it is the most amazingly soft and comfortable cover in the whole wide world, I just wish it wasn't shedding constantly...I love it so...poor defective thing. I love it, but cannot recommend you buy it, unless you can live with the shedding...did I mention I love it and it's soo sooo soft? ....sigh...stupid leaky comforter (where's the comfort in that?)"
4,Very comfortable but not very durable,It's extremely comfortable but it does tend to leak feathers at a disturbing rate. I still gave it 4 stars because it was affordable and has been extremely popular on cold nights for the last year.
5,An extremely important work,"I generally think that this is the first book anyone should read about the Druids, not because it contains a lot of information about the Druids themselves, but because it discusses the issues one faces when looking at the typical sources.This is less a book about the Druids as it is a history of the image of the druids. Thus he helps to put the writings of Posidonius, Pliny, and others into a perspective which is sorely lacking elsewhere. Yet this perspective is absolutely necessary if we are to be able to conduct proper studies of the subject.This book does not reveal the Druids so much as it reveals the problems in approaching the subject.A great deal of work has been done on the topic of the Druids in recent decades. Such material is of varying quality. This book helps set in place a framework for evaluating such scholarship, and I would highly recommend it to all interested in the topic."
4,The wrong punishment,"This film shows offenders who originally got 2-3 years e.g., laptop theft etc, who end up doing 100 years for offenses committed in prison. I am not against punishing criminals, however solitary confinement makes people worse...insane...more criminally prone. Sure, put psychopathic murders there but DON'T CREATE THEM!!!!!"
5,Adorable,I can not tell you how much I love these. They are too cute. I bought them for a freind who loves turtles and shes loves them.
1,The only color map is the cover,"This book may be informative but if you are looking for color antique maps, this book will certainly disappoint you."
1,I was thoroughly disappointed. I expected more from Moreland,This is a disgrace... don't waste your money
5,we used this book in techniques class,"I'm a painting major grad and used Ms. Edwards exercises in our techniques class. I could already draw realistically then, but has greatly improved and had a lot of easier time with Ms. Edwards' way of seeing. I had a classmate who could only draw stick figures on her first months in college and now she's an art teacher herself largely thru Ms. Edwards book. I've met a lot of friends online, who'd tell me upon learning that I'm an artist, of their desire to learn how to draw, and I always tell them to buy this book."
2,I'm a beginner,"I'm a retired engineer and have recently chosen art as a hobby. I bought several how-to-do-it books including this one. I found Betty Edwards' book interesting and motivating but it hasn't proved to be a significant source in my learning process. Rather, Ferdinand Petrie's book Drawing Landscapes in Pencil and the wonderful books by Lee Hammond have become my tutors. With them I have made surprising progress in drawing. I can highly recommend them to anyone who wants to learn to draw."
5,Surprise! I can draw!,"Citing research on differences in right brain and left brain function, the author bases her teaching method on the premise ""that developing a new way of seeing by tapping the spatial functions of the right hemisphere of your brain can help you learn to draw."" The exercises presented are designed to train the student to process visual information through the right brain, the side that sees things as they are, rather than the left brain, where human beings store symbols for what they see. The results of working these exercises was surprising and satisfying for me. By following the book's instructions, reasonable, realistic representations of people and objects began to emerge from my pencil."
5,Fantastic!,"Product exactly as described, so great to get such a spectacular price and quickly! It's awesome when shopping online means absolutely no sacrifices, but is instead is much more convenient than finding a bookstore that carries the item you want!"
5,Excellent Art book. A must-have!,"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain should be in every artist's library. I call it the Bible for art. This book allows even people who claim they can only draw stick figures, learn how to draw like a pro. I used it when teaching art and converted a lot of kids into realizing that they too can be artists! Excellent! Excellent!"
2,This 4th edition is a disappointment.,"The '89 edition is far superior to the 4th. In the 4th, the paper is thin enough to see through. Many of the drawing instructions are reproduced far too light and hard to see, much less to study. The chapter on color is GONE. Most of the interesting and informative margin notes are gone (though the space is still there), and the few that are there are in print so tiny it's not easy to read. In chapter 6, the student is advised to lift lights to create shadows, but this is not really taught until chapter 10 on lights and shadows. Why is this thrust on the student in chapter 6 when they haven't been taught it yet and may end up doing it in an incorrect way? And last, the index is incomplete, and I had to go through many pages in order to find things, since all the pages for a subject were not listed. The '89 edition is excellent."
4,Great Book,This is a great book. I really learned a lot about how to view things. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,ABC's of Drawing,"This book will teach anyone the skills needed to see how an artist sees. It is akin to learning the ABC's when you were younger. Once you learn that, you can progress (with other books) and hone the skill further.How far you take it is really up to you.I thought I could never draw because I lacked the talent, or the gene for drawing, this book dispelled that belief. If you want to draw, but can't, get this book.Or from a Nerdy D&D; perspective, it adds the drawing skill to your trained skills, and then other books and practice bump up the ranks."
5,Its all about quieting the left so the right can speak.,"For many of us, drawing a picture can be an extremely frustrating experience. The pencil just won't record what we see without much effort. There is a fundamental reason for this. In Betty Edward's groundbreaking book, she demonstrates how a great struggle is waged within our brains between the left and right hemispheres. We've become so accustomed to using the analytical left-side most of the time throughout the day, that we have difficulty shutting it down, and letting the more spontaneous right-side express itself. This book is all about excersizing that other half."
5,Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,The book more than met my expectations. The description of its condition was more than fair. I received it promptly.I am not in a fight with you.how could we be? I am only giving you a chance to fix 36 years of stuff with Star.
5,Betty Edwards Is Amazing,"I have enjoyed painting and drawing for many years. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain did more to help in realistic drawing in 2 weeks than anything else ever. I did a minimal amount of the exercises and ended up with as dramatic a difference between pre and post-instruction drawings of the hand as anything she displays in the book. I think she is really on to something in trying to disconnect the chattering, ""hurry up and make a symbol of the thing you're seeing"" part of the brain from the seeing and drawing what's actually there part. I don't know if the reason for the altered type of focus really has anything to do with left brain/right brain psychology, but the exercises truly do make a stunning difference. I could not recommend this book more highly and have told many of my friends about it."
3,Dont put all eggs in one basket..,"Yes, its a good starter book. I bought it years ago and followed all the exercises, and...for the most part it stopped there. Drawing in a nutshell is just measuring....that's all it is. But because we see with both eyes for safety our 3 dimensional world has to be dealt with. Betty's answer is turn the subject upside down. Ok. NOw if your outside how the heck are you going to turn the huge oak tree upside down? .........aint going to happen. She hopes that the right side will take it from there once you've done enough upside down work. Not so again, you have to deal with your three-dimensional eyes again. We have to somehow tone down the three-dimensional dilemma. We either half close our eyes or use a Trellis...really easy to make. That way in a sense everything becomes 2 dimensional and much easier to grasp. Still it wont be a cake walk, it never is but it will surely help your drawing skills."
2,Uncharacteristically Terrible,"Uninspired dialogue and story. Goes on and on and gets nowhere: relentlessly trying to save somebody who doesn't want to be saved. Same scenes, same relentless issue. I can't believe Parker wrote a book that I did not want to finish. Unless you're one of those people who like stories about juvenile female prostitues just because, or are one of those people who has to read every parker just because (that's me), don't bother. Read it really fast just to get it over with. The worst Parker I've read."
1,THis lower than Low BUdget,"... The tale surrounding this ... is that a woman must for one night release a demon, yet keep it contained for whatever reason. The demon was once an angel who fell in love with Satan. She was cast out of heaven and became a demon. The woman decides to have her friends over for this Ceremony and what happens after that is the demon get's loose and kills many people.Here is how low budget this film is. First off the idea for the demon (and this is towards the mid point) is teh woman who plays the angel, runs around naked with a bald cap on with horns. Oh and the woman looks to be at least 40. Second when someone dies there is no blood. They just fall or vanish. Third, to get a happy ending everyone in the end comes back to life except for one. FOurth adn the final point, the satan is made out of PAper MAche and you can tell, it looks horrible.THis is so terrible that I can't recomend it, I just can't. To do so would be an insult to the very idea of cheesy horror. ..."
5,Very good detail,Excellent examples with great direction. It is not the author's fault that I can't produce similar paintings. Maybe one day?
5,Book worth keeping!,"I wanted to take a Photojournalism course at UCLA extension. But the course schedule conflicted with my schedule (and it was a little expensive). So i looked up and course text book and this was the text. It is very informative and really shows what the photojournalists does. The author really does know his stuff, but he doesn't just share his point of view, he quotes many other journalists too. Covers a lot of material but I particularly like sections regarding what roles photojournalists are to play, the legal aspects of shooting photos and tips to get started in photojournalism. Some bookd are a bore to read and are so superficial and light on material, this one isn't. Interesting photos and good writing makes this a keeper for me. Hope you find it the same way too."
4,"Photojournalsim, 5th Ed: The Professionals' Approach","This book covers everything one needs to know, whether one is a professional or just has an interest in photography. It is a beautiful book too with descriptions and gorgeous photographs that one has not necessarily seen before.The one thing that is off-putting is that several of the chapters are incomplete; in other words, the end of the text of a chapter sometimes finishes in mid-sentence. There are at least three chpaters like this. I assume no one has checked the print job of this 5th edition, but it should be looked at for the 6th edition."
3,This Book is Dated,"There are lots of info for a college course, but info in there are very dated. Nonetheless, you always get the basic from a timeless advice and suggestions."
1,Beware: Kindle has the old edition!,"I wish the Kindle had the newest (6th) edition, but this is actually the 3rd edition and is over ten years old! Where's the new one? :( The 6th edition is a fantastic photography book, and I'd love to have it on my Kindle Fire."
3,Photo Journalism,The book was in excellent condition but turned out to be somewhat out of date information on the subject
5,Best Buy I've Had,I needed this book for my photojournalism class and it was perfect. Brand new with CD color pictured.
5,fast & reliable,the book came much sooner than the expected date!! and the book was in the condition expected! i recommend this seller. thanks a lot!
4,Beautiful but needs a different spout design,"Four and a half stars.....This is an absolutley BEAUTIFUL teapot. It holds a large amount of tea, more than I expected it to and that is a nice bonus. Washes up well and keeps the tea nice and hot.My one and only complaint about this teapot is that when I am pouring, the spout dribbles. No matter what I do or how I pour it or how full or empty the teapot is, I end up with dribbles. I carry a little crochet dishcloth to put under the pot to catch them, but it is annoying if you are trying to serve to friends.I WOULD buy this pot again just because it is so pretty on the table and has a nice size. It just needs a redesigned spout"
2,"This does not have Simplified characters, beware","I just scanned the amazon page lightly looking for any mention that this book does not contain simplified chinese, using traditional instead... Haven't found any. So if you want to learn reading Chinese that is useful in China I don't recommend this. It looks like a nice book otherwise."
3,works great--but be careful!,"I used this screen in my DIY 35mm adapter to mount SLR lenses to my video camera.It makes a great image, acting not only as a ground-glass screen but also as a condenser lens to reduce vignetting.But it's unbelievably delicate.I knew enough not to touch it with my fingers, but I ruined my first screen by trying to remove a dust spot with a lens brush! I tried to salvage things by washing it gently, but only made it worse.So, if you're building an adapter--especially a static, non-vibrating one--you must avoid dust at all cost & figure out a way to seal your screen, maybe using lens filters & hot glue."
3,Just average,"I bought this product over Amazon last winter so I could use it when I go tanning. I had hopes that it would be a good product (I usually buy Australian Gold products and am very satisfied), however when I started using this one I wasn't all that crazy about it. The smell isn't that great, and it's very greasy. Even when I step out of the tanning bed (I go tanning from anywhere from 10-20 minutes), and the lotion is still very greasy on my skin. I purchased the Australian Gold Iced Creme product along with this, and I love the Iced Creme and would buy that again. Maybe it's because I like bronzers in my lotion.. I don't know, just wouldn't buy this one again."
3,Inaccurate,"This is a good looking clock but it did not keep good enough time for me. It lost about 1 minute a week. This may not be a big deal to most but because of it's location, I had to borrow a ladder to reset the thing so it became a pain. Replaced it with one from the same company that syncs with WWV, so it is always accurate."
2,Cheap,Metal frame is copper colored instead of gold. The copper color is blotchy and uneven...doesn't look like copper. Back is all plastic.Very cheap for the money.
2,No flavor,"We bought a new bread machine to use this mix. Threw out the old one years ago. I gave this bread a bad review after the 1st loaf. Just made the 4th batch, and this bread is worth at least three and a half stars. Here's what we've learned: All ingredients must be at room temperature. The water and milk should be a bit warmer. Follow the directions carefully. It'll actually smell like you're baking bread in the last hour of the process. On second taste, the bread is pretty good. Most bread depends on what you put on it, and this bread is no different. I like the whipped peanut spread. Another favorite: spreadable butter with cinnamon and a sweetener. I'm coming back for a 2nd order. I'm a bread person, and this fits the bill."
1,YUK! But good for bird food!,I'm a big fan of Bob's Red Mill products but not this one. I thought it awful. Did not like the flavor or the texture. I gave the loaf to the birds and they ate it.
2,Big loaf and chewy texture,I bought this because I am on a low carb diet and was craving BREAD! I used to bake bread in our bread maker all the time and thought this would satisfy the craving. It kinda did but I don't think it's worth the price. I found a bread at the grocery store that has the same number of carbs as this and tastes better and is way cheaper.
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product did not rise in my bread machine. It's heavy and brown and yucky. It's expensive, and it requires the addition of whipping cream - a not inexpensive ingredient. PLUS, the mix should be stored in refrig. All in all this is a HORRIBLE product. Do not buy. Hodgson Mill European Cheese & Herb Bread Mix is 1000% better!"
2,"Low carb, high fat, sawdust","Okay, I didn't read the entire page here, so I didn't realize I needed whipping cream. In order to get the advantage of low carb, I have to clog my arteries with whipping cream? I wrote to Bob's Red Mill asking what I could use instead of whipping cream and asking, if I could not substitute, how I could get my money back. They never responded. Subsequently, I did use one package and grudgingly added the whipping cream. Neither my husband nor I liked the loaf. It was dry, almost tasteless, and had a texture which almost seemed like they had added sawdust. Now I am stuck with three more packages which I will never use. I would never buy this again and, because they didn't respond to my email, I won't buy any of their products again."
3,"Flavor is ""okay""","This is what you would expect from a Low-Carb bread. Not exactly flavorful and texture was heavy. Designed for use in a bread machine, which I don't have. May have more success using that method. I followed directions for regular baking. Made second loaf with some rosemary and olive oil on top -- helped flavor."
2,Looking for a low carb bread.,"Wanting to cut down on my carb intake and shed a few pounds gathered over the years I tried this product. The instructions were very easy to follow and the baking outcome was much better than I expected. However, the 2 star, I don't like it, rating has more to do with taste, very very tasteless, and how it feels after eating, very very full, than anything else. I do not know exactly what I might have been expecting but this was not it."
2,You almost get used to it after a while.,"I almost threw this loaf into the garbage when I first tasted it. Very horrible taste and texture. But I kept it in the fridge and toasted a slice every once in a while. I don't know whether it improved with age or I just got used to it, but eventually I ate the whole thing. I can't give it more than two stars though. I suggest the people who package this mix try another recipe, because the world needs a better low-carb bread mix."
3,A diabetic who loves bread,"Low carb bread is great for diabetics, however stores that do sell it charge very high prices. Bob's Red Mill Low-car Bread Mix is more expensive than other mixes, even at Amazon, but the extremely low carb count makes it worth trying.I've baked two of the four packs we received from our Amazon order. The taste is strong, like whole wheat. We do like a tastier flavored bread giving us a decision to make: tolerating the flavor in exchange for healthy bread, or ignoring the carbs for a richer taste.I'm not too enthusiastic about reordering Bob's low-carb bread mix...unless my physician makes it mandatory. If you're on a low-carb diet, I suggest you give Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb bread mix a try. I couldn't find anyone beside Amazon to place an order at such a good price--which included home delivery."
5,25 pound scale,"the 25 lb scale is just want I was needing, exactly as stated in the info. Great service, good shipping and packaging and looks nice. Easy to clean up. Very happy with the scale"
3,Had potential...but lost somewhere,This book starts out very well...but somewhere in the middle it kind of lost it's charm. As one of the other reviewers has pointed out...the hero's character seems pretty confusing...I wish the author had kept his character consistent.
4,Good Book - Good Characters,"I just finished ""Sinful"" and I must say, I enjoyed reading the book albeit with some frustrations. First off, the story and the characters were wonderful. I absolutely loved the beautiful Chelsea, who was her own woman, and the sinfully handsome Sinjin, particularly when he wasn't arguing with himself over his feelings... even through the frustrations, the book held my interest -it's fantasy, after all."
4,"Entertaining, keeps you interested","This was my first Susan Johnson and I found it very enjoyable. It wasn't in the usual romantic style as it is a little dark in places. My only criticism is that the hero although very appealing, becomes slightly annoying as he is almost too flawed. The author is very skillful in her writing however and I will be reading more of her novels."
4,3 1/2 Stars,"The first third of this book was tremendous. I was completely drawn into the story, and the hero was very charming.However, once Sinjin returns to London and his ""disreputable"" life, the book takes a bit of a dark turn. I was disappointed that he seemed to forget Chelsea so quickly. Especially given his intense reaction to her. There's no doubt he is denial about his feelings, but his character changed completely. Even when eventually confesses his feelings, he comes across a bit cold.I did enjoy this book, but the change is Sinjin's character left me puzzled. That said, I would still recommend this book."
2,Starts off well and then....,"This was one of the first books I read of Susan Johnson. Yes I had been warned that the sex scenes wouldbe explicit and prolific and it certainly lived up to it. The plot was all over the place and as for theending well it just seemed so out there and totally not in keeping with the rest of the book...a stud in aharem in a historical romance???? I would have liked Chelsea to have been a bit more fiery in being able tocontrol Sinjin, and although I initially liked the character of Sinjin as the book progressed I wondered whether I was going to be able to finish it."
1,Yuck!,"I have read several of Susan Johhson's novels and have enjoyed most of them throughly. I was very disappointed and had trouble finishing Sinful. The alpha male character was just disgusting. His treatment of the heroine and his perverted sexual appetites were very distasteful. Perhaps the book would have been more palatable to me if the character of Sinjin had any redeeming qualities, but I couldn't for the life of me believe that anyone as self absorbed and hedonistic as he could possibly love anyone else. Ms. Johnson wrote a sequel to this book, Wicked, about Sinjin's son Beau. He is even more sickening than his father. I would advise not bothering to read Sinful or Wicked, and instead trying any of Ms. Johnson's other books. Hopefully, you won't be left with a bad taste in your mouth."
5,Sinful,I liked this Susan Johnson book very much. It is sexy but does have a story plot. The sex was sizzling and I will read it again.
1,Avoid this book,"I did not like characters in this book. Sinjun was a sleazy himbo and the whole harem thing did not work for me. The plot of the book has many faults. For example, Sinjun is captured by her family and escapes, but they never come after him or the daughter. Why? It makes no sense. Another character makes threats on Chealsea, but there is no intense conflict which would have been developed. The book has footnotes in it, which I find annoying. This is not a college project to write a book. Any historical comments need to be in the story and not footnotes. If I want english history, I'll buy english history - not a romance novel."
2,Sinfully bad,"I bought this book expecting a great read. The cover at least made it sound good. The first part was promising too! Then it got wierd. Once Sinjun and Chelsea had a falling out, he turned so cold that I stopped liking him at all. I agree with the 1st reviewer too, the bad part went on far too long.Then suddenly there is all of this kidnapping/harem/blind stud/exhibitionsitic/misogynistict stuff that completely disrupts the flow of the book. She begins introducing new characters quickly in the last 50 pages and it becomes some wierd history piece about fueding impotent Arabs etc. As a ""Regency"" reader, I totally lost interest at this part as it turned into an action/adventure bodice ripper.The author seems to lose her track somewhere along the way and lost me as well."
2,You've lost that loving feeling.,"This book would be better categorized as erotica rather than romance. The erotic passages are graphic, if unimaginative. The main characters are irritatingly selfish and unsympathetic. Instead of the warm-hearted chase that defines most romance novels, the plot of this story follows two unpleasant characters through the random events that bring them together. You hope for them to end up together, not because it's true love and a happy ending, but because it will keep them from inflecting themselves on others."
1,sinful was awful,i thought this book was boring. i waited all week to get it and was very disappointed.
1,Bad writing...Bad storytelling,"After hearing a number of positive critical reviews of this book I brought it to read on vacation. I wasn't expecting great literature, but I'd hoped at least for a compelling beach read. I was greatly disappointed. In my opinion this book offered neither interesting storytelling nor anything close to accomplished writing. The author was constantly ""telling"" rather than showing, and his characters were developed in the most pathetic, feeble way. Caputo's attempts at metaphor and lyricism were painfully lame. The dialogue is forced and completely inauthentic, even worse he adds colloquialisms that seem utterly mismatched to the characters.As a woman, I found much of the content sexist...there is nothing quite so annoying as having an inept male author try to portray a woman's voice!"
3,"Read this for the plot, but not much else","It's like an above-average Hollywood action movie: a good plot, decent suspense, stiff dialogue, characters more symbolic than real, and cliche sex scenes. By the end I was skimming paragraphs just so I could see how it all ended up. Here's a a somewhat random snippet of Caputo's descriptive prose: ""Her movements and his stillness created an electric tension between licentiousness and chastity, passion and restraint."" To me this is readable, but I'd bet that if every other word were removed you could guess what's missing without changing the meaning. All in all, if you go in expecting to be entertained like a movie you should be satisfied. If you're expecting writing as good as some of the reviews indicate, you might well be disappointed."
3,Medicinal,"The W Post editorial has it exactly right: too long, too plodding, too much. It's like taking medicine that you know is good for you, but you don't much enjoy. Also, the reviewer captured the one or two best paragraphs in the whole book. After following these characters around for hundreds of pages, I found the only reason I slogged it out to the end was because I felt I ought to."
3,Over-long,"This is a very well plotted novel, with painstaking attention to background and authenticity; characters are also well-developed. My main criticism of it is its length, which makes it seem rather slow.It is good, but not great, and over-indulgent in its length"
1,An Act of Faith to Finish This Book,"When I read the glowing reviews of ""Acts of Faith"" by Phillip Caputo, I was encouraged. As someone who has lived and worked in Ethiopia and knows something about Sudan, I thought this was our answer to Joseph Conrad. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Mr. Caputo knows what he is talking about. He understands the region and feels the tragedy with compassion. But he is not a novelist. Like Peter Matthiessen, his writing is better suited to other genres. For Matthiessen, it is nature writing. For Caputo, it is journalism. I found this book hard going, with much of the dialogue too painful to even read, it was so amateurish. The characters are strictly cardbord. A really good editor might have saved ""Acts of Faith,"" but Caputo had no such luck. Instead, he gives us bad Hemingway and Conrad. If you want to read a great novel about the tragedy of post-colonial Africa, go back to ""A Bend in the River."""
2,Ken's review,"Way too much information on Rome. I was looking for more information on the life in Palistine during the time of Christ. This book does go into some aspects of the life in Palistine, but it is heavely weighted with Roman life. Not bad as books during this period go, but not what I expected."
5,Beautiful! David Anthony takes you to the Black Hills,"How can you possibly write a review for music that touches you as deeply as David Anthony's music touched me? I never thought that the beauty and uniqueness of the Black Hills could be expressed in any form, but David Anthony has put the Black Hills into musical form.Listen to ""Somewhere in the Black Hills"", and you are there. Close your eyes and see the sunlight sparkling on a waterfall, smell the ponderosa pine on a hot summer day, hear the buffalo rustling through the tall prairie grass, feel the soft breeze blowing on your face.And if you've never been to the Black Hills before, listen to David Anthony's music and you won't be able to stay away."
4,"2 Major Flaws, Yet Good Overall","Well, let's start with the flaws. a) As has been pointed out by a few other reviewers, the books is a bit too conversational, which can be a problem, especially when combined with flaw b. b) Strang seems to have written this book SPECIFICALLY for his linear algebra class at MIT. Fine. Great. Only if you go to MIT, though. He will constantly cite stuff that simply isn't covered in the book. It is sooooo annoying and really would take a very small amount of work to fix. Luckily, though, you can watch the MIT lectures online if you so desire (I don't, but whatever).The book is good overall, though, and outside of the examples of flaw b, it makes linear algebra really easy (sometimes I think almost too easy, as it seems as though it's not involving enough work, so therefore I must not really understand what's going on....)."
4,"also see ""Math Easy as Apples & Bananas"" by Yasmin Khan","Great book but considering the controversy and pain some people genuinly feel, I recommend the books by Yasmin Khan, ""Math Easy as Apples and Bananas"" as a first read, I have not seen anything easier in Applied Linear Algebra, with topic from Fast Fourier Transforms, Sin(x)/x, wavelets. Lets you learn in a few hours not days."
2,"Had it cost half as much, I'd give it all 5 stars","This book has some great parts in it, but half of it is extremely difficult to comprehend, and whatever you do get out of it is not worth that much money. The author should update and expand this book already, and give a clearer presentation."
1,not terribly interesting,"Granted, a couple things here are explained really well, but after reading up to beginning of ch.6 (i didn't understand anything afterwards) I don't feel like I've learned anything. Strang seems to spend more time on praising linear algebra than actually teaching it. Definitely not worth the money."
3,"Quick Intro, Verbose Proofs, Simple Problems",This book offers a quick introduction to Linear Algebra. Problems are mostly number substitution or simple manipulation of the facts presented in the section. So if you are looking for tough problems to test your understanding this is not the book. However Dr Strang covers a wide variety of topics and he has generously uploaded his video lectures on the MIT Open Courseware Website. More power to him.He presents the important results in a conversational style with adequate examples. So understanding the results are easy. However I find his style of presenting proofs a little bit too verbose. Overall a good intro book.
1,Awful book,"I agree with the others who gave this book low marks.This is NOT a book for ""introductory"" algebra courses or for building a strong basic foundation for understanding the properties of matrices. Strang rattles off with obfuscating explanations as if you have already had a previous exposure to linear algebra and matrix theory.For example, just compare Strang's explanation of the least squares method versus the explanation in Harvey Gerber's ""Elementary Linear Algebra"", and you will see what I mean. Strang's explanation is hardly adequate, while Gerber's is superior, providing an easy-to-understand motivation for the subject, a well defined proof, and copious examples. (Gerber's isn't the only book out there; there are many, many other books that are far, far better than Strang's. )For best results, if you are required to buy this book for a college course, buy this book ""used"" (to save money) or borrow it from sombody else (share with a friend?), and buy another book from which to learn."
1,Is he writing to his grand kids?,The books tone is so casual it's laughable at times. The author tries very hard to make the book sound approachable and understandable but manages to confuse the explanation with poor prose due to an inability to communicate through words.
2,"I ordered a ""good"" book and I was shipped an acceptable book",When I placed my order it was a good book. I just got a shipment confirmation email that said that the book was in acceptable condition. Am not sure why that happened.
1,Very sad,"The writer does not have enough examples, and does not explain material well. It is a totally problematic book, in that, it assumes you know, and this is a book for starters? Actually 0 stars."
1,Strang is lazy,"In the preface, Strang complains that linear algebra has been taught too abstractly. After reading this book, I realize he was just finding excuses to slack off and avoid rigor. This book is written for you average kindergartner. I was shocked by lack of rigor and complete disregard for accepted mathematical methods. Strang treats linear algebra like a literature class, and lazily strolls through it avoiding all difficult proofs, theorems, and concepts. He can probably explain some of the material half-decently so you can understand the basic idea, but this text doesn't deserve to be called a math book--it's disgusting.Buy one of the other textbooks suggested by others, or just about any other linear algebra book. All others I've seen make attempts to be as rigorous as possible. Strang only makes excuses about his lack of teaching talent and complete laziness."
5,"A pleasant read, and a strong course","This is the rare kind of math book where the author's chatty style and attentiveness to the structure of the subject shine through. The book scans smoothly, for the author's informal tone helps to bring the math concepts to the reader. The exercises are a natural extension of the material discussed, which makes this a good book to learn linear algebra from."
5,a must read,"only the first book in a trilogy, ""the sky is falling"" is definitely a book to pick up and read. the lives of norah and gavin stoakes and their journey to canada is an extremely well written and touching story. once you finish this book, the other two (""looking at the moon"" and ""the lights go on again"") are also must-reads! kudos to kit pearson, these books are brilliant!"
2,Hmm.....,"I had to read this book for reading class. At first I thought, I really hate history and I don't want to read this. Then I started to read it and then I thought ok, I don't like it that much. Personally, I didn't enjoy the book as much as I thought I would, and I wouldn't read the sequals because I didn't like the first book. I wouldn't give this book a 0, and probably not 1, but a 3 would be WAY to good for this book, so I'm giving it 2 stars. I do not reccomend this book if you don't absoulutly love history!<P.."
5,What a great book!!,This book is about an english girl named Norah and her little brother who have to leave England and go to Canada until the war is over.Norah doesn't want to go and she doesn't like who she's living with.This is one of my favorite books ever.The sequels are really good.
5,wonderful tale of starting a new life,"Gavin and Norah unhappily begin a new adventure when Mum and Dad sign them up to go across the ocean to Canada. Pearson really gets into the head of Norah. She's conflicted about leaving her home (England, not just her family and friends) and though popular at home, she finds making friends difficult and discovers she might not be as brave as she thought. Slowly, Norah adjusts... and we learn more about Norah AND Gavin in the two sequels Looking at the Moon (2 years later), and the Lights go on Again (at the end of WWII)."
5,...WAKE UP!!! FREE JAH CURE!!!,"when i first heard , ""Free Jah's Cure"" i was totally blown away.a modern rasta album in which every song is a real gem.his voice reflects inspirations from Yami Bolo and Beres Hammond.when i heard his latest release, ""Ghetto Life,"" the first thing i noticed was the production...Lord have Mercy! the bass is so deep and the kick drum hits so freakin' hard!!! the song selection for this album is slightly different in style compared to the first one. i was already familiar with the track that includes Sizzla, but when i heard ""Western Region,"" i thoughthe might have run out of ideas due to the fact that i heard a reworking of a previous melody. after listening a few times, all the tracks really started to grow on me. i enjoy this one almost as much as his debut album...his music is so beautiful, i have a hard time believing he is guilty.Om namah Shivaya"
3,Good shave but far from great,"The shave I get from this razor is the best any has given me. It lost points though due to signifigant design problems. First you can expect a couple blades to fly off the cutting head and have to be removed. That is a minor problem and does not seem to have any effect on shaving performance. The big problems are with the cleaning base. The contacts for the sensors are worthless and do not respond to fluid level. This can cause the fluid level to drop all the way to where the cleaner will not work at all and yet the low fluid light will never come on. The filter is another problem, it tends to fill with hair and clog, causing cleaning fluid to spill all over the counter. It is a good idea and when it works it works well, but much work needs to be done to make it all work consistantly."
4,Good resource for my purpose (writing mystery fiction),"I bought this book because I'm writing a mystery and my protagonist is a lawyer...and I know nothing of law. This book provides a good overview of defining what your search is about and resources for finding the information. It provides information on federal and state law as well as civil vs. criminal law, and the court system. It further details how to research specific cases, using case law and how to validate the research. I found it to be a good resource for my needs which is a basic understanding of the law and the types of research a lawyer (or her assistant) might do."
4,Great for Law Students!,"I got this book for my husband when he began law school. It was very helpful as an aide to helping him do research for his in-class briefs. Additionally, it was a great tool for helping him through his internship at a local law firm. Nolo always offers great ""how to"" books, and this book is no different. If you or someone you know is going through law school or even paralegal school, considering giving this book as a gift to them!"
5,A great help to an attorney who has been away from the law too long,"Having gone to law school several decades ago and hardly practiced since then, my legal research skills have gotten very rusty. What's worse, legal research has gone online, and I don't have a subscription to Lexis or Westlaw! I was very impressed that this book not only describes the process of legal research well but also includes FREE sources to do legal research online! It will never replace the awesome resources of a law firm or law library, but it really helped me when I represented myself in some consumer law cases. I found recent cases that interpreted the state Consumer Protection Act. Really useful book! (I can't say how useful it is for someone who has never been to law school, but other reviewers can address that question.)"
4,The Blast,"I read the book Remnants: The Mayflower Project I liked the book and will definitely read the other books in the series. The book was about a time in the future when a huge meteor is going to kill all of the living things on earth including humans. In the book they send eighty humans into space to try to continue human life after the blast. Jobs, the main character faces problems while on earth and while in outer space. Read the book to find out what he faces and if they survive in outer space. I liked this book because of all the action and all the things that the characters get into. I think this book could have had less pages in it and it contained a lot of none useful information. I think this is mainly a boy book and this book is pretty easy read. I would recommend this book to people that like action and a lot of events in one book."
4,"TICKTOCK , HERE COMES THE ROCK .........","Well,One day in 2011,Jobs a normal 14 year-old, in his car is driving,when a news flash comes on the screen,EVERYONE is talking about the end of the world,WAIT A MINUTE,THE END OF THE WORLD?? Yep, that's right, Scientists have just discovered a rather large meteor heading strait for earth.Well,when will it crash? 5 days from now....So now, to save humanity,the government will launch an old retired space shuttle,with 80 passengers, to sail away and remain in hibernation untill the ship lands,and hope they can live and recreate the human race,with a small remnant of the planet..."
1,Removing the Welcome Mat,Remnants just didn't cut it for me. Applegate not only let me down with the disappointing ending of Animorphs and the quick wrap up of Everworld but with this series as well.
2,Depressing....,"Although the book, it's really well written and anything, the book it's way too depressing for my taste, there is no hope for any of the characters, the mayflower ship, it's probably the only one, but with the stuff that happens in the end, i almost wanted to cry, the book is OK, but i could hardly recommend it, sorry, say what you say about my opinion, but those are my two cents.**1/2 out of *****Character Development: ***Dialouge: ***Story: ***Entertainment:*1/2Irrestibility:**Ending: 0 starsOriginality: **1/2"
2,Depressing....,"Although the book, it's really well written and anything, the book it's way too depressing for my taste, there is no hope for any of the characters, the mayflower ship, it's probably the only one, but with the stuff that happens in the end, i almost wanted to cry, the book is OK, but i could hardly recommend it, sorry, say what you say about my opinion, but those are my two cents.**1/2 out of *****Character Development: ***Dialouge: ***Story: ***Entertainment:*1/2Irrestibility:**Ending: 0 stars"
4,It's Coming..............................,"The Rock...A recently discovered asteriod...In 5 days it will collide with Earth...It will Destroy everything.....but 80 people can escape....It's Called the Mayflower,it's an old space shuttle with some new experimental life sustaining equitment...80 people can escape,leave the planet before its shattered...They will sleep for hundreds of years untill the ship lands,and then they will try to repopulate the speicies....But the ship holds only 80-who will get on?Who ill escape the rock?Remnants.K.A. Applegate's brand new sci-fi series...Some people don't like it because its not like her last series ""Animorphs"".Well,I agree its not the same,but why end a series to make the exact same????I think Remnants is better-in its own way.....Its worth it-If you like good books buy this book and the other ones in the series!"
3,Hardly worth it.,"Ok, I'm probably gonna get flamed for this, but I don't think this book was a worthy of successor Animorphs.Animorphs started with a bang, and left with a bigger bang. This book started with a gentle 'thud.' The first three quarters of the book (in my opinion) where very boring. It didn't really pick up until the end when a girl (I won't turn this into a spoiler) died. After that thw book didn't seem to drag so much.I think the most interesting character was Mo'Steel. He didn't see anything like him in Animorphs. I found Jobs and 2Face boring. Bill Weir looked promising for future books.All in all, this book was worth it. Almost, anyway. I think I will read the next, however if it is just as disapointing I won't continue.Hardcore Animorph fans beware, this is a very different book."
5,good music,"peaceful music, meaningful lyrics. and if you haven't heard his song ""the three R's"" (not on this cd), seek it out- a great theme song for sustainability!"
5,Elizabeth Was The Best,This is yet another fine movie supremely executed by Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie is a must-see for all Montgomery fans
5,Finally Some Elizabeth Montgomery Made For TV films out on DVD!!!!,"Ive been waitng for many years for someone to release some of Elizabeth Montgomerys made for TV films.She made so many great movies this one is a great film Ive enjoyed seeing it again and highly recommend it. Lets hope the release some more like Lizzie Borden,The Victum and Case Of Rape."
1,i am disgusted,"I cannot believe the condition the book was in when I received it. It was so nasty that I am throwing it out and getting a new one from a store. I would rather pay full price then use this book.I was also surprised that I was charged $4.99 for shipping. When I got the package, the postage was for less then $3.00.I really expected more than this!!"
4,Excellent for martial artists of any system.,"As a former Ryukyu Kempo practitioner, and a current student of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, I feel that a knowledge of neuroanatomy is fundamental to many martial arts, whether it is presented as such or not. Master Dillman's book presents this material in a very useful and comprehensible context. Overall, it has many excellent, very practical techniques. His theories and techniques are a useful adjunct to any system."
3,Take what you can from this book.. then leave it,"There is no doubt Dillman know his stuff. This book can be used as a reference source for finding pressure points. Yet he just scratches the surface. Every book demonstrating pressure points to destroy an opponent should also demostrate how to revive an opponent (not say ""read my first book"", truth is the first book didn't have much either). Spend some time stressing the damage and responsibility that comes along with the use of pressure points. Be wary the over-hyping of this book. It seems many American authors on Karate books are set on proving their ego and flashing their colorful gis. Take what you can from the book then laugh at his series of useless ""publicity bragging"" photos at the beginning of tahe book."
1,Junk Fu,This stuff doesn't work. Only the willing will it work on. The rest of us will be pounding your head in. Dillman is a charlatan and so are his cronies.I went to one of the seminars and found out first hand that not even the 200 plus pound instructor could make any of this nonsense work on me. They thought my nerves were dead because I do Wing Chun. I don't know where they would get that idea. My student however sent the instructor flying when he put his hands on him. I was a little embarrassed by it but not more than the big sensei.
4,Right on the Money,"Anyone who claims that Dillman's people have never been in the UFC are correct! Have you ever read the rules? NO pressure point fighters were allowed, I know of a guy who is a 5th dan under DKI who was refused entry. Something interesting though, Renzo Gracie was seen kicking a guy in the jaw when he was laying on his back, to anyone who know accupressure, it was right in S5, picture perfect KO!!!! Good work George!"
5,naihanchi secrets told;,the kata naihanchi will come to life as never before during the read of this book.the applications are very good and useful. once again dillman has a winner.
3,A detailed introduction to the DKI system of PP fighting,An interesting presentation of concepts for martial artists of various backgrounds and systems.
4,Fantastic Explanations without mystery,"Professor Dillman clears the air and takes some of the mystery out of what has been hidden. More correctly he gets the reader to shift their paradigm and look within their own arts. Clear diagrams, pictures and a sometimes murky text but an excellent treaties on the subject of pressure point knockouts. One of three volumes, and you should get all three. Attending one of his seminars helps make the text more understandable."
2,Interesting stuff - but mostly esoteric,"Nicely structured book for the theoretically interested martial artists It is interesting to read, but don't depend on that stuff when the going get's tough - have you ever seen someone in the Ultimate Fighting Championships to pressure point-knockout someone? See. Mr. Dillman may not be a fraud - but his fighting system surely is. Why do people always claim to have the ultimate fighting system?"
5,Another Great Book on Pressure Points !!!,"This is a great book - very interesting and informative. A must read for the serious martial arts disciple. Master Dillman is a living legend. I have liked this book so well that I have included in my Listmania! ""Secret Self Defense"".Master Dutch Hinkle, author of ""Secret Buttons of the Hand: -21- Attack Stopping Pressure Points of the Hand"""
1,big disappointment,"Dillman knows how to do pressure points, but his book is too general and the pictures are taken from 10 feet away during one of his seminars. He should have hired someone to do close up pictures. If you want to see people passing out ,fine.If you really want to learn this stuff, don't waste your money."
5,Priceless little volume!,I owned this book thirty years ago. I ordered two copies today - one for work and one for home. It's pages contain nuggets of wisdom that have served me well over the years. I have no idea what happened to my original copy but won't be without one now. A real gem!! REPRINT PLEASE!!!!!!!
5,A SUCCESS PRIMER FOR LIFE OR BUSINESS,"All-to-true tips for living and managing. Super small business gift. Desperately needs reprinting. Provides easily identifiable traits for everyday conduct in daily social interactions as well as business atmospheres. Must read for the ""newbie"" or the more experienced. Refreshing reminders that can change attitudes and performance."
1,God's Little Acre,Video tape was defective. It had sound on the first half only. I notified the seller but he never responded. It was a disappointment because I watched the movie but couldn't hear the dialogue at the end!
4,More of a watermelon pink,"The ring is more hot pink in person and the balls are more of a watermelon pink-red, not light pink like in the picture. It's still a pretty ring, and the sparkles catch your eye in the right light."
1,REVOLTING,"I stupidly bought 20 packets of this garbage, along with the 20 packets of 'chocolate mousse' flavour because they were on special. Now, I have tried many brands of protein, and obviously some are better than others, but this was a whole new dimension of bad taste. I literally felt nauseous every time I drank one - I only drank them because I could't give them away to my friends and couldnt bring myself to throw $80 in the bin. I had to mix it with like 500ml of water (milk made it too thick and even more disgusting) to dilute the taste, and make the bitterness less noticable.The flavours sound deliceous, however, they are not."
5,nice and attractive lamp,A nice and attractive lamp found place in the living room. It came with CFC dimmable bulb of 25 W; LED would have been great. Overall the lamp looks great in the room.
4,Great style,"We love our lamp and haven't had any problems since we've had it (3 months). It's beautiful and heavy (won't sway back and forth when you turn it on) or fall on children if they graze by it.4 stars because the actual color on the base is much more brown than brassy. The picture doesn't really show it well and it appears much lighter in color than it actually is.UPDATE: Lamp is still great. Had it for 6 months now. No problems and fits all types of bulbs.Update: We've had the lamp for one year now and it still looks brand new. We have 3 active kids and the lamp HAS been pushed over finally (by me, of course). Not a scratch on it, no dents, no nicks... We've switched to the energy efficient bulbs only and although the bulbs don't do the lower wattage like the traditional bulbs, it provides just as much light as the other bulbs. I'm so glad we got this lamp. It is prettier now then it was a year ago bc it looks like it belongs here and I can't imagine my living room without it!"
5,Amazed,"I read this book about two years ago and that's why I don't remember many details. I simply want to say that it marked my life (for better), opened mine eyes, and helped my faith. I thank Mr. Morneau for writing this book and God for iluminating him."
4,Cover it,"I needed to order these to cover my water shut offs after drywalling my basement ceiling. They fit nice, open/close easy and can be painted to match your ceiling color if needed."
3,Not rocket science,"Aimed at those never having served, the book covers the basics of being on a Board. There are a few innovative concepts, but most is common sense. The first and last chapters can be skipped as the anecdote does not offer much value and slows the pace of the book."
1,Should be zero stars.,"This movie is so terrible it's hard to explain. I saw this when it first came out, my brother rented it because it said Shaun of the Dead on the cover. My brother is fooled easily, that would have been the red flag that would have made me NOT rent this crap. I remember watching it and thinking, when does this get funny, when will I like a character, when will it get even a couple miles in range of being scary? This ""movie"", full of it's lame overdone plot and crap actors reciting crap lines is just another movie that should be forgotten by everyone. Sadly, ""horror"" fans will cling to this trash because the classics just aren't good enough. Don't rent this, don't buy this, don't even look at the cover! Don't make me regret wasting my time writing about this turd of a film. I wish I was a billionaire so I could buy every copy and burn them all!"
1,See one of the worst horror movies with one of the worst plots,"Even in the description of the movie at the theatre said itwas bad. Its supposed to be. A group of friends on a roadtrip get lost and guess what? Have to stay at a hotel, which turns psycho. Already predictable. Its funny in places. The scene in the kitchen with the guy eating the blueberries isthe scene I laughed the hardest. Some scenes are just plaingruesome. Like That one close up of the guy getting stabbed in the head with a garden hoe and then all the blood and guts spewing out of him. Hard to watch. So, people start getting killed one by one, and the friends try to survive as the town slowly starts turning into zombies. This is where it starts getting stupid. And I mean bad horror. The scenes that cut to the gas station guy singing with guitar get weirder. Expecially the, "" we're coming to get you,"" song. The reason behind seeing this is because its so bad. Some of it hillarious. The end of the movie is defintley the worst part."
2,hyped bore,"seriously, this was hyped by almost everyone in the horror community. are we all that retarded? the set up is boring as heck, the gore is great, i'll give it that. why not rent the ""Shaun of the Dead"" they taunt on the box for an actual good time. it's boring, cliche'd beyond belief, and it's comedy doesn't work at all. except the singer. he was funny."
1,Don't Always Believe the Hype! A Bad Idea Carried to Fruition,"Not Scary, Not Funny, Bad Writing, Bad Directing, Annoying Bad Music, Cliche Ridden, Some Interesting Camera Work. A Good Cast completely Wasted, An Uninspired and Uninteresting Little film for people with an IQ of 70 on a warm day."
1,20 Dollars... Totally wasted.,"I thought since people were saying that this movie was ""The Answer to Shaun of the Dead."" it would be quite witty, and I'd love it. I thought wrong. Not only did they milk the 'stupid redneck' character for all it's worth, but the jokes and humor left a lot to be desired. The country band singing during all the intermissions was horribly annoying, and the so called Zombie dance number wasn't as funny as all the hype made it out to be. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie to anyone, if you want to see it for yourself, you'd be better off renting it.Save your money and buy Shaun of the Dead."
1,One of the worst kinds of movies ever,"This movie is terrible from start to finish. Bad acting, bad plot, bad everything. But to make it worse, it was just good enough to make you think it was going to get better so you stay watching hoping for a better movie. It never does. I wish it was a tiny bit worse so we wouldn't have continued watching hoping for it to get better."
2,I paid money for this?,"Cover says, americas answer to shaun of the dead! Sorry but shaun of the dead was good! I could watch it over and over. Thismovie just down right sucks. Do yourself a favor and don't wasteyour money."
4,REDNECK ZOMBIES,"DEAD AND BREAKFAST is like SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It never takes itself seriously and it has some truly inspired imagery. Imagine a country western singer who acts as kind of a Greek chorus, narrating the events that have happened or will happen. This is an extremely gory little movie, with some over the top decapitations and other death scenes. David Carradine and his daughter Ever lead the pack, but ably supported by Jeremy Sisto, Erik Palladino, Gina Phillips, Oz Perkins (Anthony's son), and other capable actors. These are not truly zombies, but merely dead souls revived by a deadly spirit first conjured by Carradine. DEAD AND BREAKFAST is fun in its own perverted manner, and it surely beats many of the straight to video atrocities we've been forced to absorb."
3,ok for a spoof,"Well, they set out to write a zombie spoof and they did it. Some parts are stupid and, like another reviewer said, some jokes fall flat but it's ok. The songs are great though and the black white (and red) comic strips are inventive. I liked the cinematography of the movie and the use of the comic book to help in telling the story. Although this spoof cannot even be compared to Shaun of the Dead, it is good enough to watch on a Sunday night when there is nothing else on TV. Also, Carradine is always a welcomed addition to any movie.Dead & Breakfast"
4,I'm Still Laughing...,"This movie's a hoot! It's stupid as hell but it's really gory and hilarious, and that's more than you can say for what passes off as ""unrated"" these days, much less the crap/horror coming out in the theaters. This is the perfect drive-in movie, if there were any left. It had a few scenes which didn't seem to work when it was trying to be funny, but nevertheless the special effects were top-notch and the actors were just annoying enuff to make you want to see them bumped off, and they are. It's horror-comedy near it's best, just an entertaining movie."
2,Total Let Down. Don't get suckered by the previews,"I am the person who got suckered by the previews. I anticipated something quirky, funny and irreverent. It's just dumb. Not in a horrible way, but it's bad all the same. It's not the worst movie I have seen but I was totally let down. The previews led me to believe it was something much funnier.I loved Shaun Of The Dead. This is not an american answer to that. Not even close. It's just a very cheap and silly movie. It's not even that funny. I had a couple of laughs. Not big laughs either.If you have to see it, rent it."
3,"AWESOME movie, misleading picture","dont get me wrong tis movie is amazing! it has been on my wish list for a long time, and i was very excited to finaly buy it. BUT the covr shown is the cool looking 3D one, which is the one i wanted ( hence the reason for ordering it) although the one i recieved was just the boring white cover, dissapointing."
4,Gory Good Times!,"Campy, gory, fun good times. This movie doesn't take itself seriouly and has alot of nods to The Evil Dead franchise.Lots of comedic moments along with a few decent scares. David Carradine shows up in this film too, which is kind of random, but provides some good moments.Check this film out if you're a true horror buff!"
1,WARNING WANRING! False advertisement,"The American answer to SHAUN OF THE DEAD?Not really. SHAUN was about releationships and efforts to care on many different levels.This film sinks to gore and anger.By the end of Shaun you worry about the people involved. Here in this film, you just wind up not caring and don't give a crap and want it to end. NOW!I'd like my money back please. And my time. And my shelf space. And my sense of humor."
4,Unrated Version,"I went into this film knowing nothing about it, and I thought it was one of the best surprises in a long while. The tone is moderately slapstick (Dead Alive) and shows its torso full of gore.For sake of brevity, I won't go into the plot, but will say that some of the best parts of the film are the transitions. They usher along/recap the story by way of acoustic/country music. Some of the transitions are straight forward, while others charge headlong into comedic little diddies. I enjoyed the music so much that I purchased the soundtrack a few days later.Many of the characters are likeable and David Carradine is in the film. What more can you ask? There is gore a plenty and even a dance number. Also, the angle of how the zombies come to be is a fresh one. if you know nothing of this film, you can always give it a rent to see if it's worth a purchase.P.S. you can't go wrong with the unrated version."
2,"The US answer to Shaun of the Dead? Yeah, right!!!","This had to be the worst zombie movie (with the exception of (The Undead)) that I've ever had the chance to zone out to. My problem is that: I'm just too much of a serious horror fan. Now, I like a good laugh just as much as the next person, but this was just too corny for words. Two stars? Well, actually I gave it a one, but added the second because of Gina Phillips (Jeepers Creepers). I still think she's just too cute."
1,"""NOT the U.S. answer to 'Shaun of the Dead'."" Dead and Breakfast sucks","the guy that said that Dead and Breakfast is ""the U.S. answer to 'Shaun of the Dead'."" is a idiot ! Dead and Breakfast sucked ! They arent even Zombies ! they dont eat flesh, they arent stupid and they dont stumble around slowly. They look and act like clean cut deadites, most of em dont even look dead ! i mean Come on 3 people with home made cheap-o pipe guns fight off a group of ""zombies"". and instead of the ""zombies"" attacking the house all at once... they all line up and take turns trying to get in ?!? how polite of them ! im sorry but the Jokes werent really funny unless you are 13 years old. The only funny thing about this film was the one song the ""zombie"" country singer did about ""blood is sweet as moonshine"" this film is no shaun of the dead."
1,I Just Don't Understand!,"Yes, just like my title. I just do NOT understand how some people could give this piece of crap 3, 4, even up to 5 stars!! One of the most unwatchible movies I ever rented! I am SO glad I rented it instead of buying this trash. And what was that racket they were so-called singing? Plus the acting was horrible! All I can say is everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but don't say I did not warn you. Like a viewer mentioned earlier, if you want, zombies, comedy, blood and gore, please rent 'Return of the Living Dead.' It is soooo much better than this trash. Thank you."
2,"""...performed some kind of black magic type s**t on it.""","Had I known that there was going to be some tiresome country & western, rapping Greek chorus guy popping in every few minutes and singing I never would have watched this movie.What's even worse than the guy beating on a bucket while surrounded by dancing zombies is how clever this movie thinks it is...it's not.If you're a True Horror Fan who wants his/her horror filled with hate, graphic violence, perverse sex and talent then skip DEAD & BREAKFAST. If you looking for something light then watch RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD again instead."
3,Dead and Breakfast (Unrated Edition),"Fun Little Zombie movie. If you havent seen Line dancing Zombies, then this one is for you!"
3,Ridiculous Silliness,"Review title says it all. Still, if you are in the mood for that kind of thing, it moves really fast and does provide a chuckle. A definite attempt to take on Evil Dead II, but much more contrived to be amusing. All in all, on a rainy cold weekend afternoon with nothing on TV, it's a diversion."
4,Horror with a funny twist,Dead and Breakfast is a horror flick with a funny twist. Enjoyable if you get the irony.
4,Hubba Hubba ! !,I purchased this item for my wife who is a very picky person. She was quite pleased with this item and needless to say I Loved it !!
3,"Nice biography, but not technical enough","This book gives a short overview over the life of Alan Turing, though it does not go as deep into detail as Douglas Hofstaedter does - and that was just one article in his Metamagicum collection! But if you don't already have Hofstaedter on your bookshelf, you might as well buy this book.Unfortunately, the mathematical and technical stuff in the book are only described very vaguely - I did not understand how the Enigma code was cracked, or how the proofs concerning computability worked. I am not quite sure whether the author understood what he was writing about."
5,This Works,"After a lifetime of diets,my search stops here.Well done book which really allows you to change your lifestyle and realize that what you do eat is more important than what you do not eat.This did not start as a weightloss plan,maybe that's why it's so good. I strongly recommend this book."
4,The Kick Start I needed,"I basically bought this book so I wouldn't have to keep renewing it at the library. The concept is so simple yet effective. The recipes are delicious and even thought prep time is lengthy, the actual cook time is under 10 mins. It is effective (I lost 5 lbs while eating more than ever in just 2 weeks!! I recommended it to anyone with digestive and constipation issues and migraines."
2,Nothing New,"Nothing new here. The book was disappointingly heavier on menus, recipes and citations than on substance. I did not find this book particularly informative, interesting or compelling. There was about 25 pages of genuine information and explanation. I have found much more compelling explanations about the impact of dietary changes on human health from books on the Paleo Diet. What Galland wrote made sense and he makes a good case for his contentions, but it struck me as largely rehashed and repackaged with nothing terribly novel. I don't believe for a minute that more than a very few people could maintain this diet for more than a few months, let alone a lifetime. If I'd been looking for a cookbook, I might have appreciated it more."
2,Not the plan for me,"I was so excited to read the testimonials. Then I purchased the book and saw how few calories a person is supposed to eat for breakfast. I tried the egg white fritatta. It tasted good, but didn't hold me for long. Just not a program that will work for me. I need more calories first thing in the morning to stave off hunger."
5,The Fat Resistance Diet,This book is a very viable and valid tool for those who have tried other diets and failed. Not only are many cutting edge informational tools outlined but the diet itself has been designed to help those who still wish to EAT and lose weight. The nutritional information is very factual and everyone should at least read this book.
4,fabulous recipes,"While I still am working on some of the ""staples"" of the diet (I'm not used to drinking chia tea 3 X a day) the recipes I have tried are truly tasty and good. Some I've tried soundlike weird combinations, but the author knows how to put themtogether to not only taste good but be truly good for you."
3,"Healthy eating plan, did not work for weight loss","While there are many positive aspects to this diet (namely, increased fruit and vegetable consumption), I did not find it effective for weight loss. My sister and I both followed the menu plan for phase one...my sister stayed the same weight and I actually gained 1 pound. I believe that the foods were not filling/fibrous enough for the calories, since you use fruit juices and concentrates and some other relatively empty foods. I will say that I felt healthy otherwise and had less headaches than usual. This would be a great general way of eating healthy."
3,Fat,"This book is right along side with all my other diet books. I take what applies to me and my physical needs and learn from many different approaches. Yes, I am still trying to lose."
3,hmmm,"I have read just about every diet/nutrition book out there. This is the first one that actually had some new information that I was not previously aware of. The concept is great, but the diet is so rigid it would be very hard to actually follow the food choices - oh wait, there are no choices! That is right, no substutions at all. It is interesting to read though."
1,the fat resistance diet by dr leo galland,"i subscribe to xm radio and particularly enjoy dr mehmet oz...i had listened to dr leo galland on his show and thought what he had to say was very compelling, so i bought the book...i was so disapointed....he could have condwensed the entire contents of the book to one page, even one sentence...give up refined sugar...nevertheless, because i have always had a problem with high cholesterol, i faithfully tried his program for several months...then i had my cholesterol checked again...nothing had changed...i will continue on with his diet for 4 more months, but no longer have high expectations..."
2,Too hard not practical,This program is way too constrictive and thats coming from an Atkins veteran!!
4,Good information -,"This is a wonderful book for getting some of the basics of healthy eating. AT times it was a little convuluted, but reamins a strong basic read for changing habits. A few weeks ago, I started following some of the advice and have lost about 5 pounds, sleep better, and feel more energetic."
5,This diet has changed my life,This principles of this diet have changed my life and I now feel so well. The general inflammation I was feeling throughout my body has gone. I've also lost 8 kilos in weight and am pretty much stable now. The book is well written and ever so easy to understand. I love the recipes and have no desire to ever go back to eating processed foods again.
4,It seems to work!,Our doctor recommended this book because he felt that its fat-resistance diet would halt the inflammation aggravating my husband's severe arthritis. It certainly helped my arthritis; I feel better than I have in about 10 years. The recipes are delicious and easily prepared. The text is clear.
5,Makes sense to me,"I bought the book based on a review in a magazine. I like the menu plans, the shopping lists, the recipes. I think it is do-able. I am not sure I believe in the theory but eating three meals comprised of good sound foods and careful snacking twice a day would make for healthy living. I am retired. I cook and eat most of my meals at home. I have over the years lost control over portions. I think using the book with its shopping lists, menu plans, recipes, is the perfect solution to getting back on track."
2,Disappointed-Does not explain stages of plan,"Though this book has helpful information on leptin, the diet section of the book is really a just a list of meals with recipes. Dr. Galland talks of three phases of the diet, but never explains what types of food you may eat on each plan. Nor does he explain each phase of the diet which I find strange. While the recipes look good, a lot of work would go into preparing them on a daily basis. I was surpised and disappointed that Dr. Galland does not explain his three phases of the diet. If you are looking for general infomation and guidlines book may be good. Also okay if you are willing to cook a specific recipe for each day of the diet. If you want information on each phase of the diet-which I thought had been the purpose of the book-it is not here which I find strange."
5,Healthy Way To Lose Weight,This way of eating healthy makes a big difference in the way you feel. The diet has you eating plenty of fruits and vegetables about nine servings instead of five. The food requires shopping more often to maintain the freshness of the vegetables and fruit and is costlier than other diets I have tried but I feel it was well worth it. The recipes are easy to follow and grocery lists are provided for the first four weeks. Easy to read and follow.
1,Didn't work for us...,"When I saw these wagon wheels, I thought the kids (3 and 5) would enjoy the fun shape. My kids regularly eat whole-grain pasta, but my kids refuse to eat these- and I agree that it has a gritty texture- we've tried multiple times and it's either too soft so that it falls apart, or part of the pasta wheel is uncooked- maybe this is a poorly designed shape? I usually enjoy products from this Hodgson Mill..."
4,wonderful pasta,Love whole wheat pasta. So much better for you than the white stuff. Because these are wagon wheels you might want to undercook them a little more than normal so they wheels dont colapse
4,CD reiissue called More Dangerous Madness,"Readers be aware. The original product ""Dangerous Madness"" is still available as a title but does not feature the video and bonus track featured on ""More Dangerous Madness"". These are the same albums apart from the bonus material.Through my ignorance I now have both copies!"
5,Just What We Needed!,"I don't believe in curses but something has been going on in Cleveland sports for most of my life and it hasn't been good. Finally someone has put the crazy, absurd and disappointing down on paper and I think it's great. I was too young to remember Herb Score and my family talks about Rocky Colavito like he was a saint. I remember I cried as a little kid when Brian Sipe's pass ended up as ""Red Right 88"". But there's other neat stuff in this book that's funny and not so well known that helps us Cleveland sports fans deal with our plight. Curses! is a fun and easy book that's a must for every Clevelander, sports fan or not."
1,Curses Why Cleveland et.al,"Book has never zrrived . It was promizsed in MarchMAIL TO NEW ADDRESSRichard J. Drew 5487 Territorial Road Grand Blanc, Michigan48439-1956"
4,Musings from the northwoods.......,This little book was very moving for me. What I come away with is some real empathy for the whole subject of body image and the magic of poetry cuts to the chase! I look forward to Isabel Duke's next book.
4,"A Very Fine Reference, but...","...marred by the separate sections for photos and text, leading to very inconvenient page flipping in order to see what is being described.Otherwise, this book constitutes a fine achievement."
5,Better than the first edition,"Excellent new edition. More photographs, more information. Very practical. A very good guide for palm lovers, researchers, collectionists. They need now one spanish edition."
3,Lots of Pretty Pictures but ........,Lots of Pretty Pictures but ........almost all these palms cant survive in 80% of the USA .Its a good reference book . Coming upon some of these specimens in nature is another thing .
5,Dry humor but hilarious!,"Virtually every page has something funny. Even the cover has a joke on it. If you are into ""alternative medicine"", you might be offended. Your thinking might be flawed -- give it a shot!"
3,Ok I guess,I am a home daycare provider. I have been a daycare provider for 6 yrs nowI own 5 potty training Videos/dvd's. I Can Go Potty! is mostly for parents to get an idea on how to potty train their child. It is an ok video but you can can get the ideas from a book and not have to listen to the child host. Who isn't very good. My kids didn't care for this video at all. It does have 2 cute songs but I wish I had skipped buying this tape. It is very boring to say the least.I would recomend the fowolling tapes/dvdsPotty Power - For Boys & GirlsIt's Potty Timeand for older kidsBear in the Big Blue House - Potty Time with BearThis in wonderful kids who are already trained but have accidents from time to time. Potty Time with Bear show kids what accidents and how to avoid them. Very sweetly done.
5,Spiritual Soul Food,This book is nurturing from the first page. It gently leads you to a pleasantly full stomach and a calm mind amidst the junk food and increasing daily stress of most of our lives. It explains the basic science of good nutrition without getting overly technical and gives you step by step practices to incorporate healthier habits and feel more vitality very quickly. It is ever mindful of the difficulty of always eating the most nutritious food and has many good suggestions for making the best of it. Body and mind live together and this book makes the relationship stronger and healthier than any other nutrition/diet book that I have read.
3,"uplifting, but not too many details","the book is very motivating in terms of changing one's diet. It also has A LOT of good info. on how to do a cleanse (foods to eat, etc.), but otherwise it is very short on specifics about what foods to eat and why. Most recipes in the book are tofu-based, fyi."
2,It was okay,"I was a little disappointed in this book. From all the reviews I've read I really expected more. It really didn't keep my interest, it took me months to get through it. It's not that it was bad it's just that I couldn't get into it and kept putting it aside. Some books are just like that and this book happens to be that for me."
2,Didn't do it for me either,"I agree with reviewer(Judith) from Ft. Lauderdale. We all know this is fiction, but for 450 pages of a thick book, i didn't find any depth with the story line. Dissapointing!!!"
2,Too wordy....,"To paraphrase Samantha, ""By the God's"", I felt like I was having a root canal trying to read this book. It was (and still is, since I can't seem to get through it) a struggle to read.443 pages is nice, but not when it is drivel. As I usually do my reading on the deck, one nice result of this book was that I began to really enjoy birdwatching. Sorry, Ms. Georgio. This could have been a decent book with some good editing cuts."
2,Did Ms. Giorgio copy someone?,"I was astounded at the similarities this book has with Melissa Good's ""Tropical Storm"". Alex and Samantha are almost reproductions of Ms. Good's Dar and Kerry - Alex is tall, has dark hair and blue eyes just like Dar, and Samantha is short, has blonde hair and green eyes just like Kerry. Alex is the hero just like Dar, they are both into martial arts, they are both rich and beautiful, and they both have very supportive families. Samantha's family is very similar to Kerry's - especially the domineering father and the passive, pathetic mother. Sam has a sister who sticks by her just like Kerry. The only problem is that Dar and Kerry were around before Alex and Sam. I could go on and on about the similarities and it leaves me wondering if some copying went on. I would not recommend this book - in fact, I left it at the last hotel I stayed in! ""Tropical Storm"" is a much better read!"
5,A Book You Won't Forget!,"Powerful intertwining story of two women from different background, who stumble upon each other at Laguna Beach and soon discover a rich and captivating ancient love exists between them. Carol's excellent writing style has skillfully drawn well developed characters in a romantic tale that is not only touching, but guarantees pure sensuality in every chapter. When it comes to tugging on your heart strings, you'll find this is just the book to do that. It's a story rich in plot and excitement, with characters that will grab your curiosity and keep you with them until the last page. The story line is crisp, filled with varying levels and types of tension, including beautiful love scenes, some jealousy and never eases up on the throttle until the novel is finished. I've now purchased a second copy of this wonderful book as I wore the first one out from reading it."
2,Not her best,"While Quinn is one of my favorite historical romance authors, this one had clunky dialogue, plot holes, empty characters, and other missteps. I'm heartened to know that as her second book, this disappointment is in the past and not in our future. I will have to say that the humor in this book was reminiscent of Katie MacAlister's work which is a good thing."
2,BORING,Out of all the other JQ books I did not enjoy this book at all. It was painfully boring. Dont waste your money.
2,Not a Worthy Regency Romance,This is the second book I've read by the author and I had hopes of growth in maturity but it was in vain. The characters were one-dimensional and read like modern day high schoolers. My biggest issue with it is the historical inaccuracies. I don't mind creative licensing but the author doesn't seem to have a good understanding at all of the time period she's writing about. I don't know if I'll attempt this author again but I do not recommend her to anyone over 20 years old or to anyone who has genuine interest in the Regency time period.
2,Don't judge Julia Quinn by this book,"A regency romance about a girl who comes to stay with her cousins in the country and meets an intriguing, war-damaged man. They face obstacles such as his guilt and an old enemy back for revenge.My first Julia Quinn book was The Duke and I, which is part of the Bridgerton series. It is a wonderful, well-written book and I was expecting this one to be the same. Sadly, it fell decidedly short of my expectations. Grammatically it was fine, but plotwise it was a bit thin and forced. Some of the things the characters do and say are absurd and just silly. Fortunately, this was written years before the Bridgerton series and Julia Quinn's writing has dramatically improved. If you want to read a Quinn book, start with The Duke and I.Still, if you don't expect too much, this is a fairly entertaining book and if you're desperate for something to read, try this."
4,Great By the Pool!,"Not her best, but surely another great read from Julia Quinn ! I love the characters with their usual humor and engaging dialogue. Also check out a fresh voice in romance from a male author -Shade of the Maple by Kirk martin. Very deep with great insight, perfect by the pool. Saw it highlighted as a Top Pick in Romantic Times. Keep them coming, Ms. Quinn!"
2,"Not bad, but...","I love JQ's books. After reading all of the Bridgerton series and the novels that came after that, I figured I'd give her first trilogy a try.The stories is not bad, but you can tell that they were the first few books published by her. Her style was still coming together and ideas where getting polished.One thing I found troubling me throughout this story is that Belle was kidnapped in the previous book, right? And for some reason, this was not mentioned in this book. Even though she went through another kidnapping (failed, but still). It kept coming up and nagging me over and over throughout the story, and I'm afraid I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've. However, I love Persephone. What a lovely lady."
2,Disapointing,"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Julia Quinn's novels. Typically they have strong female characters, dashing rakes/scoundrels that turn good, humorous banter from all characters, and within the plot the leads experience some kind of personal growth. This book started promising since the main female character Arabella was an interesting sub-character in ""Splendid."" However in this book ""Dancing at Midnight"" it must have stroked midnight and she just fizzled! Trust me: read ""Splendid"" skip this book and go straight ahead to read ""Minx"" which follows the other sub-character from ""Splendid"" William Dunford."
5,Not the best Julia Quinn.. But good!,I thought they were a cute couple and I could tell they really loved each other.
4,"Not her best, but I still liked it!","This novel is the second in a the series of Splendid, Dancing at Midnight, aned Minx (along with a short story in the anthology ""Where's My Hero."") This book was alittle hard tog et into and the hero was not as appealing as some others (such as ANY of the Bridgerton men) but it has much more of a regency feel from her first novel, Splendid. I thought that the mystery surrownding the war history would be a little bit more...traumatizing, but all in all it was a good novel. I love the character of Arabella and, of course, it was nice visiting with all the characters of Splendid again!"
4,"Good Follow Up to ""Splendid""","I would HIGHLY recommend reading ""Splendid"" prior to this novel because you will understand the characters a lot better. However, on its own ""DANCING AT MIDNIGHT"" is a good novel.Lady Arabella ""Bella"" Blydon is searching for a love match. Fed up with London, she visits her cousin, Emma, at her country estate while her parents are touring Italy. During a quite moment, while she is reading, Lord John Blackwood comes upon her. The first meeting is not the best John could do. However, Bella is determined to make a better meeting with Lord John, and thus the romance begins.This book is well done. It is not Julia's best, but it is not bad either. However, like I said before, reading ""Splendid"" first will let you understand the characters in this book better."
4,A fun read!,"Not my favorite JQ book, but definitely a fun, witty book that held my attention. I liked that the Characters from Spledid were back (and Minx!) The plot was fun, but got a bit hokey at the end."
3,"This was a nice, easy read.","This was my first Julia Quinn novel and I knew that it was one of her earliest works. I didn't hold out much hope for it, but was pleasantly surprised. While it lacks ""umph,"" it's not intolerable by any stretch.I liked both characters main characters as well as the peripheral ones. The storyline was okay and the dialogue was decent.The love scenes were definitely lacking. They were not very thorough and definitely lacked sizzle. I'm hoping the other J.Q. novels spice it up a little bit. :)Overall, this is a safe, fun read. Not one of the best, but certainly not one of the worst."
2,"Yes, disappointing","I read this after Romancing Mr. Bridgerton, which was a mistake, and only highlighted how much better Julia Quinn has become since this early work. I agree with the reviewer who found Lord John boring, and a bit of a whiner. The 'horrors of war' that he experienced didn't seem to warrant the angst he was feeling. And I wasn't much impressed with Arabella's bluestocking-ness. I found myself skimming the book, just to get a sense of the story; this is one for the 'donate to library' pile."
1,Boring like its hero!,"I read this because it's sequel to Splendid which I enjoyed. What happened to Arabella here I think was she's just simply bored because Emma was busy with Alex(they're having a baby) and the season is over that she pursued her cousin's neighbor who is the most boring and less attractive(also stupid by suggesting to his nemesis they meet on his in-laws townhouse) hero on Julia Quinn books. And I don't see why Arabella is attracted to this John Blackwood (so weak and helpless, he could not even defend her and her mom at the crisis in which he brought, thanks to Persephone,Alex and William who saved the day). They have NO chemistry and the courtship is under develop to get to point that they can't live without the other and it made it so corny. I think it would be more interesting if Ms. Quinn just paired Arabella to Anthony Bridgerton therefore uniting these two series. If you would read Splendid, skip this one(because it's waste of time) and proceed to Minx (more delightful)."
1,Very disappointing,"Having read and loved all the Bridgerton novels, I decided to go back and read some of Julia Quinn's earlier efforts. This book was a total waste of time. I just kept skipping through it hoping it would get better but it never did. Belle and John were just totally annoying and I found Belle's insistence on ""helping"" John with dangerous situations just plain asinine. Also unbelievable was the fact that she was melting down to skin and bones after just 3 days of being ill. Thank goodness, Ms. Quinn's writing improved with age. This book is going in the garbage."
1,"You can do better, Julia Quinn","I was really disapointed after reading this book.I really enjoyed Quinns other books and thought this one was just as good.But it was not.Belle is much more fun in SPLENDID and the ""hero"" John Blackwood is dull and oh so boring.There is a lot of talk about Shakespear and poets and poetry. Belle even nags the poor boring John about writing her a poetry.The best thing about this book is that it includes the people from SPLENDID. It's always nice ""meeting"" them again.I'm so sorry, Julia Quinn, but this time you just lost your magic touch."
3,An unusually unorigional JQ book,"This book stunk! But im a huge fan of JQs, I've read all her books and loved them. Except for this one. I read splendid, and was wondering what happened to Arabella, so I got it. But instead of writing a huge literary comment, how about this. If you've ever read a 'typical' romance book, just put Arabellas name in for the lead female and you have this story."
3,"Cute but , a bit slow","I am a fan of Julia Quinn, but this book took some doing for me to finish. It just moved too slowly. I must say that Julia Quinn has made quite an improvement since this book was written."
2,Not her best,"This book lacks the humor that many of her other books have. I began reading the Bridgerton series first and have since then decided to read all of Julia Quinn's books. However, this is the first one to really disappoint. I just couldn't see any chemistry or like any of the characters."
5,"Wonderful, Absolutly Wonderful","I loved this book. Of course I love all of Julia Quinn's books, but this one holds something special for me. I loved the characters and the way that Julia Quinn captures the humor of life through the book. The dialogue of the characters is hysterical, all of them are so witty and humorous. I would recomend this book to anyone. It is one of my personal favorites."
1,Disappointing...,"I'm a huge fan of Julia Quinn but this book was a huge disappointment. For one, I was so tired of reading about how the ""hero"" was tortured over something that, in my opinion, he had nothing to really do with. I wanted to pull out my hair and scream, ""Get Over It Already!!!"" I had struggle to read the last few pages...in fact, I'm not sure I did read the last few pages. The story started out okay but quickly went downhill."
5,"Funny, witty, original and humorous","Lovely! Very well-written. I enjoyed it very much. The plot was good and the characters were delightfully original and realistic- especially Olive and Giogi. Highly recommended, but you should read the first book in the series -'Azure BONDS'- first"
5,This'll be the reward for reading Azure Bonds,"The first and third books in the series are good to read once, but Wyvern's Spur can be read over and over again. I can't guess how many times I've read it. While the other books are kind of dark and spooky, WSpur is just fun. It's a kick in the pants. Giogioni is my kind of hero. I doubt the missus'll let me name a kid after him though.... Oh well. Hooray for Giogi!"
2,Meh.,Mediocre cash-in on the success of Azure Bonds (which wasn't originally intended as a trilogy).
2,re-hashed Caroline Myss material,This CD is a self-serving commercial that will sound familiar to anyone who has read or listened to Medical Intuitive Caroline Myss. Boring and not worth the price.
2,Sophomore Slump,"Neale's second book, Facing Facts, is not in the same league as his first book, Descriptions, which had a justly large impact on the field. It is a repetitive slog through well-known territory. The problems with the Slingshot Argument against the existence of facts have been known for decades, and despite many pages advocating the importance and impact of this insipid and inconsequential footnote to 20th century philosophy, in the end, the Slingshot Argument is rejected for the reasons we've been familiar with for two decades."
3,"Makes you think, even when you disagree","I have read about 5 of Edwards books. He is great at getting you to think differently about the Christian Life and how things could (and often should) be different. However, he often takes what would charitably be called ""poetic license"" when he uses the Bible to support his ideas. Just when I am convinced I should throw the book away, then I will come across an idea that made it worthwhile. I have enough Bible knowledge to know when he misquotes it, but I would NOT recommend his books to people who would not know the difference. In this book, I thought the week 5 exercise was the most helpful suggestion I had received in weeks. BTW be sure to actually do at least week one before even reading week 5, and I did all the weeks in the order he suggested which is much wiser."
3,Okay,"I bought two cd's by Stephen Rhodes (Pure Tranquility and Perfume), but I didn't like this one as much as Pure Tranquility. Can't quite put my finger on it..."
3,Used copy of City in the Sand,"This book is damaged; the front cover is partially detached. I don't remember exactly what the item description said, but if that was in there, it was in technical terms that I didn't understand--and I'm a librarian. I don't expect a used book to be like new, but there would be some way to say ""will fall apart if you turn the pages"" that would be clear. Or of course, the information might not have been in the description. Like I said, I don't remember. Anyway, I'm glad to have a copy but if I had understood its condition correctly I would have spent a little more and bought a better one."
4,Black & White original footage,"This is a good set of 5 discs on WW II, if you are a WW II buffI reccommend it. The narrator tells the story but you willfind some footage that does not go along with the event he istelling about. Hellcats and P-40s at the battle of Midway, no way.Don't get me wrong, this is a good set and overlook some ofthese errors, they are not numerous. No color, all in blackand white taken at the time it all happened. A good series butother better series can be purchased. If you get it for $10 itis worth it."
1,Not what I expected...,"I practice yoga myself and have for years - the exercise of it, not the Eastern Philosophy of it. This video is a bit to Eastern for my taste with my three year old.However, that's not my biggest complaint. It's stupid. Boring. And doesn't come close to resembling anything similar to yoga. There's far too much ""junk"" in between segments, and I understand you have to keep segments short to keep kids interested, but the segments in between poses either get the child totally distracted or totally bored, and she then doesn't want to do the next pose.My daughter hated it. I couldn't stand it. I guess we'll go back to having her do ""real"" yoga with me."
5,Surprised!,Purchased it for my 6 year old nephew. He uses the video on days when he does not have Tae Kwan Do class. He is very active and this video relaxes him. We were surprised to find just how much he learned from the video until he had a discussion with his pediatrician about his favorite positions! Not only did he name them but demonstrated a few for his doctor!
3,Yoga for kids,"It is a nice way of introducing yoga, especially if you don't have a yoga instructor for kids in your area .Cons:I feel they should have taken it as a class more so its easy for children to follow step by step. Sometimes with the songs and other playful things they get distracted. It may work for some children but not for all"
5,"i love it, my son loves it!","i bought this when my son was 3. at first he just watched and then he ""participated"" by running around the room and saying ""i'm running like a friendship flower. i'm running like a caterpillar. etc."" now he actually does some poses. it's just a nicely paced video, very engaging for children. also it's a good stretch for me so i enjoy doing the video with my son. highly recommended."
3,I don't know...,"My almost 3 year old daughter decided that she loved yoga & wanted to do it more often. So, I bought her a couple of DVDs. Unfortunately, she loved the grown-up yoga DVD I already had...! If given the choice between this one (which she demanded we turn off the first time we played it for her), the other kids yoga DVD, or a grown-up one, the grown-up DVD would win every time. This one is cute, but she doesn't like it at all..."
3,"Yoga Kids, Vol. 2: ABC's for Ages 3-6",this video is ok... I have used it for ages 3 to 5 and have found children at these ages would either like more instruction on how to do the poses as well as learn more poses or would rather more capturing animation related to popular kids movie stories such as the Disney series...
3,Great for children - tough mug to view though,"This is a great DVD for young children to do some fun exercise. Marsha Wenig is very creative and provides lots of playful activities. Despite looking like Jack KlugmanQuincy, M.E.: Season 3, Ms. Wenig proves you can achieve success while lacking a pleasing appearance. This is not the purpose, however, of the DVD, so I recommend it for providing young children with fun and healthy exercise."
4,One to grow into,"Our daughter has weak muscles and I was looking for a workout video that our family could do together to supplement her physical therapy. I saw the good reviews and although I have never tried Yoga before, I decided to purchase the video. I have thoroughly enjoyed it. My daughters don't make it all the way through yet because they get bored. They are only 3 right now so I think as time goes on this will become a favorite for us all."
4,Pretty good Yoga for kids DVD,"I bought this for my 2 and 1/2 year old niece. It's a bit too old for her because it's a bit long and moves quickly. She enjoys doing it up to the letter O, which isn't too bad. The DVD moves too quickly through the poses for her to really be able to get it, but that could be due to her age. The songs are fun and sometimes when I spend the day with her I'll let the DVD play for the nice background and she'll do a little Yoga here and there.I wish there was a way to preview this DVD before purchase. I, also, wish someone would make a yoga DVD aimed at 2-4 year olds.Overall, satisfied with DVD."
4,It's O.K.,My daughter is almost 7 and she has had this for a few years now. She does it every so often but usually when she has a friend to do it with. Yes it's a bit boring but she actually likes the pace.
4,Great interactive yoga video for preschoolers,"I bought this when my daughter was 2. She liked to watch it, but wasn't quite ready to participate, she would give up about half way through. She pulled it out 2 weeks ago, and has wanted to do yoga almost everyday since. She's already learned many poses, and seems to want to learn more each time.So great to have her up and moving, learning some of the basics to yoga while I'm cooking dinner."
5,Loved it!!!!,"I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old who both love this DVD. The poses are simple enough for my three year old to do, but challenging enough to interest her. My one year old isn't ready to activly participate but loves to look at the interesting animals, people and pictures. This is not only good for getting kids off the couch, it also helps to reinforce thier ABC's in an exciting way."
5,Kids love it,I got this for my then 2yr old daughter and she loved it. She is now 6 and she still loves taking this dvd out to play. The movements and interaction is engaging and if we do yoga together I usually get stuck doing this one instead of my Bryan Kest or another on of mine.
3,Not as exciting as I'd hoped based on reviews . . .,"This DVD is perfectly fine . . . just not really great! I really expected a great product based on reviews I read. I have a 3 year old and a 5 year old and they both started out interested but the 3 year old lost interest quickly and although the 5 year old hung in there, I began to get bored! Too much time is taken on each letter so I feel it's just slow by design. Many moves are fun, but they stick with each one (with each letter) for too long."
3,I notice nothing,I've been using this product faithfully twice a day for 9 days and I notice nothing by way of any improvement. I am losing faith that there are any topical products out there that can correct/improve wrinkles of any sort. But there sure are many that can blow a hole in your checkbook!
4,nice job,"The book moves quickly and leaves me wondering in some spots, but I must say, this has been one of the best books I have read on the topic. It's fun to read."
2,Flavor rather bland,"I know, I know, it's a protein shake, not supposed to taste great, but this one is really quite bland. Will not order this flavor again unless I can find a way to doctor it up."
5,A triumph for the human spirit,"It is refreshing to read a book like Another Arabesque in a time when the words Arab and Middle-East are associated with conflict, failure and destruction. Professor Tofik Karam succeeds in capturing one of the most inspiring examples of the human ability to adapt, exchange culture and overcome conflict. The Arab emigration to Brazil provides hope and an example for a future resolution of the tensions that permeate the relations between the West and Arab countries. Professor Karam writes in a sensible and sympathetic manner, while retaining objectivity. This book is an instant classic. It is rare for such an scholarly work to be written in such a pleasant and elegant style."
5,worked great!,"It worked and was easy to use... just followed the instructions it smokes and smells something terrible so run out of the bathroom as soon as you use it. I had to use it three times but it cleared my drainage in the bathtub ... wooohooo I can take a bath tomorrow after i clean the bathtub from all the filth which has been backing up from the kitchen sink for the last three weeks. I have tried snaking it , draino, and vinegar with baking powder... and of course the plunger!!! Nothing worked but i saw this product at lowes today and it caught my eye because it said it worked with heat ...all i know is it worked great and im very happy to have found it."
1,WORSEN drain,"My tub drain was pretty problematic so I poured Draino every once in a while. When I saw this product, I tried it. Now my tub barely drains at all. It backed up my water and turned it blue which means I was standing in Zep chemical. Save your money up for a plummer."
2,Not Worth the Price,"I've been having pretty bad luck lately with CD players, so I finally decided to try a new brand. Based on this product, I wouldn't buy another GPX CD player.It was only an okay CD player when it was first purchased. It wouldn't play some of my burnt CDs although it claims to play both CD-R and CD-R/W. Because of the 60-second playback, it vibrated all the time. Despite those things, I was mildy sastified with the CD player at the time.However, within a month of owning this player, the ball bearings that hold the CD in place all popped out. I literally hadn't done anything; I hadn't dropped it or manhandled it. They just popped out when I was switching CDs. I don't doubt that if it hadn't been that, it would have been something else.Don't waste your money on this brand. Instead, look for a slightly more expensive one from a more trusted brand. It'll be worth it in the long run."
1,Terrible I would not buy another,This item stoped working after 7 days of light use.This item was treated well and with care.What a waste of money.
3,TruXedo,The cover started puckering along the front and rear edges and as a result doesn't fit well along the back edge above the tailgate. The company sent a replacement cover (just the fabric) but that is about the same as the first.
4,"Important geologic coverage of a nat'l treasure, LOUSY photos","Lucky for me, I bought the new HC edition for $10 rather than $85. Why? As another reviewer stated, this is the definitive single source on the geology of Grand Canyon--and it may be. But I can honestly report that the photos are not. Around 80% of the shots are of low to poor quality. And while no photo framed in a geology book can compare to the real thing (especially in the case of this natural wonder), buyers of this item will be puzzled by the junky photos selected. In fact, given the importance of this national treasure, a color panorama shot, a color aerial photo, and high quality B/Ws are a must."
4,Early seventies brass rock-at least one classic track!,"There was a surge after the success of Chicago and BS&T in the U.K to try the same formula (although Coloseum were way ahead of the crowd in the rock solo's in jazz settings) some were awful (heaven, swegus) others were excellant (mogul thrash,warm dust, satisfaction) others were somewhere in between Walrus were one of these. The album is like goldust to find (and the C.D!) but if you persevere it is well worth having, even if for the opener 'who can i trust' which is up there with 'i'm a man' or '25or6to4' as one of those classics that packs such a punch and deserves to be cranked up on the system as much as you can (or your neighbours) stand. Priceless. Shame it's so short. The rest varies from jazzy workouts and poppy physc(hence the 4*) which don't really work. The playing is fine and there's some nice solo's throughout and a good Traffic cover. A worthy reissue."
2,I Dont Think So,"Let me say i can guarantee that i love Brass/Horn Rock more than most people. However what is with all the good reviews for this album are you people crazy the song compositions arent that good not to mention the terrible and i mean terrible vocals. I dont care how good some of the Horn Charts are if an album has terrible singing why keep it. Lets get our standards up a little there are way better Horn Rock albums out there and im not just talking about B,S & T, Chicago and Lighthouse there are other good ones to. Avoid this one please"
1,A Waste of Money,"My Jobar Folding Clothes Rack was thrown out with the trash today. When it first arrived, it had a light coating of rust on each part. I built it anyway, which was no easy task since it was incredibly flimsy, then took it outside and sprayed it with Rustoleum. It was lopsided when open, and it wouldn't close properly when it was time to put it away. I thought I would take it apart and donate it to charity, but it didn't survive the process of removing the screws."
3,Clothes rack,"Hard to put together, parts did not all fit well. Ended up using materials I already had at home. Works for hanging clothes, but not worth the time spent trying to jimmy it together."
2,Disappointed,"Jobar Folding Clothes RackContrary to advertising on box, extremely difficult to assemble. Ordered two racks, but can only use one as one rack did not come with enough screws and one of its poles had defective hardware."
1,Pnrts missing,"I opened the box, removed everything, opened the screws, etc. into a plastic tray with sides. I lined up everything and then checked them off to make sure everything was there. Nope! all 8 of the end caps were missing. After trying to purchase them with out any luck I am looking at the open box and wondering how I could put myself through that. I did not even check the poles since it did not make any difference without the end caps. I went out and purchased a folding cloths rack, a much better one for $24.95 and did not have to put it together or pay shipping. This one was $29.94 with shipping.I am going to have to re-think this ordering from Amazon again since this is not the first time. I will just be tossing it out since I do not have the original shipping container it came in. I had removed it from the box and taken the shipping container to the dumpster several days before opening the box itself."
1,"junk, junk, and more junk",I got this folding dryer rack because it looked like one i've had for 12 years and is still in good shape...I got this set it up and the thing is so crooked its funny... my mistake for not taking the word of others...please don't be as foolish as me... stay away from this piece of junk... and i do mean JUNK...
3,Jobar Folding Clothes Rack,I use it to dry clothing items. Its a bit flimsy- but it does the trick. It folds up nicely for storage.
2,Comments on Garment Rack,It was extremely difficult to assemble and am still having problems after spending three hours on a so called easy assembly. I would prefer purchasing an assembled rack even if cost more.
3,response,"As the author of this book, I'd just like to say that it was never meant to be a comprehensive guide to chess. First and foremost, it is a math guide about problem-solving strategies. (Notice the series name?) While I certainly would have liked to have included ""en passant,"" it simply did not fit the scope of the book. And game notation would have required an entire book of its own. I had 32 pages to work with, and math needed to take center stage. If you are a math teacher, I believe that you would appreciate the book much more than the previous reviewer does.On a personal note, being a chess player myself, I think the book is a decent starter's guide for young chess players. All the basic men/moves are covered. And readers even get to follow several in-game scenarios to their logical ends. But hey, that's just my opinion.Greg Rozaps, I had to give the book a rating to leave these comments. So i chose middle of the road."
1,This Book Gives Little--Not Even the Complete Laws of Play,"This book is priced higher (I paid $22.50) than many other books aimed at chess beginners, but it contains far less than most. I collect chess books, and have seen a wide range of quality, and nonetheless was surprised that this book does not even contain a full set of the rules of play. (""En passant"" pawn captures are not covered, and while castling is mentioned, some of the requirements for castling are left out.) There is nothing on chess notation in this book; nor is there even a single chess game. Some books priced as low as $2 give the reader far, far more. NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Not so cool antenna ball topper,"I was ready to LOVE this - looked so much cuter than the Mickey Mouse I had before (these things really do help you find your car in a parking lot). I was disappointed 'cause when she arrived, first - she had no headband at all! Oh well, still cute w/the pink hair. Second, the cute pink hair was white (I'm sure from the sun) within TWO MONTHS!!! Not cute OR helpful any more!!"
4,Crafty Ladies...Witchy read.,"Although the story was not strong, I can hardly remember it. I did enjoy reading this bookIt goes something like this....Evil lurks beneath the surface in a village where women meet to 'chat' on the local hills in a religious community who don't want any form of pagan or witchcraft taking effect in their godly village.A local theatre company play a large part in the book, with all the fun and games involved in that. With a mix of eccentric characters.The Witching Time is an enjoyable descriptive read about local cozy craft shops, wise women and witches...If you like books with a witchy theme then you will probably enjoy the read alsoA nice read in all, but read to be entertained by the beautiful crafty descriptions and creative characters not the story........ As stated in other reviews this book is somewhat confusing and leaves you wondering where the story actaully was..."
3,Reissue of Previously Released DVD,"A retitled/repackaged/reissue of ""Bob Dylan, 1966-1978: After The Crash"" (Chrome Dreams 2005).Okay content, but unless a completist, second one is superfluous."
1,Twice received but it doesn't play,"My husband bought this for me off my wish list. The first one arrived, but wouldn't play. My husband went through the return process and another was sent, but it wouldn't play either. He refused to go through the return process again, so I still haven't received a workable copy. What a disappointment."
5,I love christian bale,I'm Korean..So...My English is not very good...What I really want to say is..... christian bale is a good player..I love christian bale..
2,disappointing,"I have to say I was looking so foward to seeing this film. The concept is wonderful. It's too bad the last 15 minutes are about the worst ending I have ever seen. A pleasant story of two lost souls with a common love of animals and the natural world. Suddenly it turns into some gangster horror flick. Complete with car chases, kidnapping and blood. It's as if this ridiculous ending mocks the entire film. As someone who deeply identified with both Bobby and Mr. Summers it was an outrage that this story would take this sensational, unbelievable turn."
2,disappointing adaptation,"The film not only didn't do justice to the book but also lost the feel, the atmosphere and the message. Christian Bale, a fine actor, is horribly mis-cast. Some key scenes were lost from the book and I question the choices made by the writer and/or director with regards to this. Obvious commercial decisions caused this film to lack the emotive power that was so evident in the novel. Read the book, forget the film."
5,Excellent,My husband used it on his trip down the Yukon. He was VERY happy with it. It is very compact also.
4,MSR Whisperlite,"This is a good stove for back packing. It would be a great stove if it came with only a few more features. Unfortunately, MSR figured out that they can offer those other features and call it a different model of stove and charge more money for it. Still, if you are really weight-conscious in back packing, this stove will heat your food, take up very little space, and not wear you down with extra weight."
5,Great little stove,"Purchased the MSR Whisperlite Liquid-Fuel Stove for backpacking and for emergency backup for camping. Takes up very little space since it folds up so small. This one burns white fuel only, since I dont travel outside the U.S. i didnt see the need for the tri fuel model.It was a bit tricky to light at first but after a couple of times of using it its as easy as any other stove. Have not used it in windy conditions as of yet so Im not sure how wind effects the flame. The Whisperlight does boil water quickly, just remember boil times very with alttitude from sea level.The only drawbacks I have with the Whisperlight is the flame is so intense at all levels of adjustment that simmering is difficult. I got around this by building a small tri-pod from deadfall and elevated the pot higher above the burner.Also the fact you have to buy the fuel bottles seperatly, this is an added extra expense to consider when buying. I prefer the 22 oz. bottles for all around use."
4,MST stove,"I purchased the stove based on the positive feedback it received. The stove arrived as promised. When I opened the package I found it contained only the stove. Despite the fact that the item is pictured with the fuel bottle, the bottle IS NOT included in the listed price. It must be purchased separately and costs from $11 to $22 depending on the size you want. The picture is a bit misleading and subsequent purchasers should be advised the fuel bottle is not included in the purchase price. That said, the stove seems to be well made for its stated purpose. I have not been able to actually use it yet because I am waiting for the fuel bottle (purchased separately) to arrive. Then I will have to find an outlet for the Coleman fuel to use with the stove. Stay tuned...."
4,Nice stove,At this point I've tested it once and actually cooked with it once. The tank pressure and valve control take a little work getting used to. Like anything else it seems getting the proper pressure and flame temp in place simply takes practice rather than being something faulty in the system. I'm very pleased and would recommend this stove to people seeking a light weight stove taking up a relatively small space. If you some off road motorcycle overnights this seems like a great fit.
3,Needs to be better made.,I bought this item for my magic show and it did not make it past the second show before the latch started to bend and the door popped open. Once I replaced it with much better latch it worked great.
3,"Love the heroine, love the background. Story line okay.","I like Thea Kozak. Her work fascinates me, her love life intrigues me, her mother isn't perfect, which helps to make her real. I think the story line gets a bit violent. But my appreciation of the background will keep me reading Kate Flora's books."
3,Educational consultant Thea Kozak investigates a homicide,"> This is the 3rd in the series featuring Thea Kozak, a New England educational consultant, as amateur sleuth. This time around she's been conscripted by her own mother to help a woman with 2 small children who is being blamed by the authorities for her husband's murder.> Thea gets pretty banged up in this adventure, perhaps too often for credibility. I also found the motive for murder and the murderer a bit incredible. Still, who reads a mystery for its universality and theme? This is a good -- not a great, but a good -- read; and I look forward to catching up with Thea in her first 2 books which I have no as yet read."
4,Nice backgammon set,"Overall this is a very nice backgammon set, not too big, not too small. My wife and I play on a regular basis and wanted a set that looked nice. This fit the bill. The only downside to this set is that it only comes with 15 pieces of each color so if you lose one you will be short. I've seen others that come with 16 pieces just in case. A nice set though for the price and we are very happy with our purchase."
1,Don't waste your money,"There's nothing deluxe about this backgammon set. It's made of the cheapest, smelliest vinyl they could find. Even the spots where the pieces go on the board are cheap vinyl!! My set has spots where the stitching is loose and places where the fabric on the inside of the board is coming loose and it was that way brand new out of the box. It's a mess and the only reason I didn't return it was because in the end I would lose money because of the shipping cost. Please don't waste your money on this set!!!!! Also, the dice are the size of peas. The board smells so bad that my daughter doesn't even like to use it. The only positive thing I can say is that I like the little size because it would be easy to transport."
2,Deluxe Backgammon Case,"I read the reviews before purchasing this product and thought maybe people were just expecting too much. However, when I received my order, I fully agreed with other reviews. The dice are the size of a pea (literally). The game box and pieces are definitely small. I have a nice backgammon game, but have literally worn it out playing it, so was hoping to replace it with something similar. This was not it! I did not return it because it would cost me shipping, but definitely not something I would have bought if I had seen it first."
2,Average,"I was disappointed in the craftsmanship, however its ok for the buck. You get what you pay for! If you are looking for something bigger and classier this is not it."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this product and received it the other day. Upon opening I discovered that the craftsmanship is extremely poor. The red and white lanes for placing the chips are not evenly placed which adds to confusion while moving your pieces. The sowing of the colored lanes is poor and will start falling apart quickly. Further, the middle part of the set is uneven so you are unable to place a bumped piece there. Save your money and get a different product."
3,Backgammon Case,"The triangles on the playing board are stitched down and the pieces get caught on the edges. It's very annoying. Also, much smaller than expected."
1,havent received it yet?!,"havent received it yet?! maybe it got lost in the mail. this is why I like to buy stuff from stores, then they put it in my hand, then I go home and use it."
2,Disappointing -- Dated stories,"I wished I had looked a bit more closely to see that the three stories in this book were first written in the early 1980's. There are classics worth re-reading, but this wasn't one. I enjoyed the stories, but they were rather tame and not as well written as later books. Not a keeper."
5,COLECCION DE ORO MANOLO MUNOZ,"QUE BIEN,ESTE ES SIN LUGAR A DUDAS EL DISCO QUE ANDABA BUSCANDO,LAS MEJORES CANCIONES,TODAS DE LA EPOCA,HONESTAMENTE SE DISFRUTA AL MAXIMO.GRACIAS POR LA MUSICA.FELFO G VARGAS.COSTA RICA DALLAS.AUDIOFILO."
1,Oh my God no! Not the song!!!,"I hated Doogie Howser, always have. Harris is cursed for life with this character. Wherever he goes, whatever he does, he'll always be Doogie Howser. This season is as ridiculous and stupid as all of them. But the crowning jewel of all 80's stupidity, was the condom song.C'mon everybody sing along! ""He's docta Doogie. doc docta Doogie!"" Then Harris will look right at the screen with a stern look and preach about the dangers of sex. He then commands the viewer (you) to wear a condom.And every single damn episode he had to write in his computer journal. That heart tugging, tear jerking paragraph that was supposed to humble you and get you through the week. WRONG!!! I was a teenager when this show was on the air. I hated it then and I can't even enjoy it now. Stupid, lame show."
2,If this book were a race horse it would have pulled up lame.,"I have been an avid fan of this author's work, but I am sorry to say this is nowhere near his best. I thought his sketch of the wise, heroic seventen year old protagonist would have been more appropriate for juvenile literature. This fired jockey shifts career gears instantly to become the expert bodyguard for his father? His father rises quickly and without a single misstep to become prime minister? Better spend your money on almost any other Francis book."
1,"A major, major Dick Francis Disappointment!","If you're thinking of buying this book, save your money! I have every book written by dick Francis and have been one of his biggest fans! but ""To the Hilt"" was only so-so; this one is a complete flop! The characters are not believable, the dialogue is just awful. Gee whiz, what were the editors thinking? Francis seems to be on a twice-a-year kick, never mind quality!"
3,Not one of Francis' best,"As a huge fan of Francis' novels, especially his earlier work, I've noticed that his more recent books lack consistency. 10 lb. Penalty is one of his weaker efforts. The politician father is too perfect for real life; a little more conflict in his character would have made the story of his rise much more interesting. And as for the narrator son, what teenage boy is so willing to devote his life to the advancement of a father he barely knows? The unrealistic characters and lack of internal conflict are unusual for a writer who is usually so strong in this area. Still, not a bad plot in terms of the bad guys."
3,"Always a reliable author, not always spectacular","I've read all of Dick Francis's books which are consistently readable and interesting. Some of them of great, especially his earlier, grittier works. However, I've noticed a tendency in his more recent books for him to focus on the problems of the wealthy. Maybe this betrays a little boredom with his work, or fatigue. Having a wealthy protagonist of course makes a lot of problems easier to solve, but it also makes the novel's problems not very interesting. This is true of 10 Lb. Penalty, a pleasant read, but hardly his best work."
2,Interesting but lacks credibility,"The plot is interesting and educational to those of us who know little about British politics and less about horse racing. However the assassination attempts, especially the shoot-and-stumble, are less than credible and the final resolution is totally unbelieveable."
2,Not One Of His Best,"The story is a good one until the halfway point and then seems to wander aimlessly. Still, worth reading if only for the likable characters and the message of morality."
2,Not Francis' best effort.,"Over the years, I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Francis' books. 10 lb penalty seemed like two separate books. I very much enjoyed the first half of the book which took place over a period of a few months. However, the second half almost seemed like the outline of a story. Francis has always done a great job of describing the little details of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. In the first half of this book, he again succeeds in this regard. The second half, which takes place over an extended period of time is missing the rich characterization which is the hallmark of a Francis book. The conclusion to the story was far too simple and convenient. In the end, this book was a disappointment to me."
3,A bit of a change....,"This novel is tangentially about horses, and it is a mystery, but I think it is also an attempt by Francis to try something a little bit different. It is a coming-of-age novel, with a promising by very young hero, and it also has some elements of the long tradition of the British comedy of manners.While it will nver be in my top ten percent of Francis' novels, it has a sunniness and good cheer that makes it a good light read."
3,An also ran,"I've read and re-read all of the Francis books for many years. I did not like the one about the train ride in Canada and I did not think much of this one. For one thing, it is physically not much of a book-triple space pages and still short. It is predictable and dull. I only give it a five rating because I'm such a fan of Mr. Francis(I just finished re-reading Whiphand, a great book). Maybe next time. Cheers JJ"
2,Francis at his worst so far.,"Having read this book, I have come to the sad conclusion that perhaps Dick Francis has finally written one book too many. Certainly he is far off the form that produced such winners as the Sid Halley books, Bonecrack, or The Danger, to mention just a few. In this one, the plot is weak and obvious, the characters poorly developed (except for the clothes they wear, their looks, and their inevitable purity or villainy), and the outcome entirely predictable. I felt with some dismay that it's probably time for Francis to retire from his second profession, although I will miss him as will his many other devoted readers. But this would be a far better choice than to watch his high-energy thoroughbred writing style become that of a mere hack."
4,Francis exhibits maturity in writing as he finishes career,"In 10 lb. Penalty, Dick Francis continues to develop his themes of father/son relationships and the changing vagaries of life.For the die-hard fans of Mr. Francis's early books, this could be a disapointment: his tough-for-toughness-sake heroes are gone. In their stead are characters with limitations, with spoken sorrows but (thank heaven) the same unquenchable honor and good sense. Perhaps his novels change because Mr. Francis, himself, is not the person he was 40 years ago. This will please some, not others. However, it is a respectable effort with thought-out motivations expressed in the author's clean prose.I understand this may be the final Dick Francis mystery. If so, pick out a stack of your favorites and read them all again in tribute but start with this last one. It's nice to look back on the course right after you've crossed the finish line."
4,Long live Mr. Francis...,"I have just finished reading some of the reviews written by other Francis fans. I have only one comment for all you whiners complaining about the ""decline"" in Francis' works- are you nuts?!??? Give me a Francis novel any day. This book, like all of this fine gentleman's book, was a joy to read. It was predictable in the sense that the good guys win and the bad guys go to jail. I can live with that kind of predictability. But what touched me most about 10 LB. PENALTY is the wonderful descriptions of the joy in life. The enduring relationships of parent and child and the ""stuff""- different for every individual- that adds color to our lives. Mr. Francis, once again, has taken this reader for an enjoyable ride. By the way, if an author does not change or evolve after writing so many wonderful novels, his pulse ought to be checked."
5,Gorgeous,"With Vol.1, this is as far as I know the only set of complete violin concertos of Telemann, although being as prolific as he was, I'm suprised there are not more volumes.Beautifully played on period instruments, with Australian-born Elizabeth Wallfisch in top form, this is very engaging stuff. Telemann was a master of melodic invention so if you like a good tune this is for you. Recording quality is excellent - warm and detailed.Good on you CPO for releasing so much rarely recorded music.Recommended for all lovers of Baroque music."
3,Cooler Cover,"I liked this album for its being so hard to find and for its coverbut then the music was pretty cool too...some tracks are a bitlengthy than they should be but the cover song of Chuck Berry(track 11) made up for it. If you want to look for more by theartist then you know it was a good listen which was the casefor me. It misses one good hit to make it to 4 stars.Solid rock stuff but deficient melodies. Similar artistsare Mountain and Black Sabbath.Get the album with the bonus tracks, it has a 24 pagebooklet about the band and rare photographs.Track 9) Hobo10) Sad Song11) No Particular Place To Go12) Just A Little Rock And Roll13)Barbershop Rock-Dan the ManWSUM show host"
3,titanic game,"It is ok, but the toy arrived in different condition than what the seller described. There were pieces missing and there were no instructions. Thanks to the internet and a good copy shop I was able to complete the game. All in all the game is good, alot like monopoly."
1,Price increase then decrease after purchase,Very upset the game had no instructions. To get instructions I have to pay more money. I ordered it originally and it was $24 then when going for final purchase says price increase to $74. Two days after I got the product with n o instructions the same game was once again $24
5,The Real Deal,"I have bought Ceramic ion brushes from local drugstores, but wondered why their bristles seemed to scrape my scalp when I tried to detangle my very straight, fine hair.Then I bought one at a local salon (paid way to much for it) and the bristles ""held"" my hair while brushing without scraping! It was wonderful!Well, the brand I bought at the Salon is this same brush on Amazon. I was looking for another size in the same brush, so instead of going back to the overpriced Salon, I bought it here. It's the only brush I will use on my hair now, expecially when blow-drying to create a bit of a wave."
3,it was great,rancid is a good band. the single should be the riot song. roots radical is already a good song. the single does not sound different
5,My favorite Celtic CD,"Flook's Rubai quickly bacame the favorite album in my colleciton. It is so full of imagery, energy, life and (mostly) happiness, it's infectious. Would that all infections were so life-giving!My two favorites on th disc are ""Beehive: The Beehive/Poon Hill/Vladimir's Steamboat"" Especially on the third part, I can see myself as a lad, running down the banks of the river, trying to keep up with the steamboat puffing along.The other is Granny In The Attic. I can almost hear her up there, puttering around, humming or singing a little ditty, then worrying about some object or other, then going back to puttering and singing. It's so sweet, I get a tear or two.I expect this will quickly become one of your favorites as well."
4,More like an Anatomy book.,I didn't expect this book to be more like an anatomy guide. It has scientific labels on the different muscles and skeletal parts. I was hoping to get just an illustration book on the human figure. This one is more of a scientific reference. The illustrations are very well done though.
2,Dissapointed,Not very impressed. I have a lot of Anatomy. Actually too many. I get upset when I buy these because you run this type of risk. Its okay but there are definitely better.
5,Entertaining and Witty,"My daughter and I really enjoyed this book. The cartoons are genuinely funny, unique, and intelligent. It's refreshing to see this kind of humor is still around."
1,Absolute junk!,"Don't buy these, they're junk! These are smaller than described, so your mop scratches the floor as you move it and you can only mop very slowly, lightly, and carefully. They're saturated with detergent that you just can't rinse out, so you can't actually rinse your floor. Worst of all, my first one separated from the plastic back on the 4th use, and the second one separated after the first use. These were used once a week on a tiny kitchen floor, where I am used to mop heads lasting for months. Unfortunately, I bought 10, and they won't take them back."
4,Pretty good.,"This book is fine as long as you know what you are getting. It's an outline with review questions and answers at the end. Answering the questions DID help me pass the test that I was preparing for without having to go back a re-read a bunch of material. This book is not full of details, just a summary of what you learned in undergad business courses."
1,Praxis II Business Test (0100) review book,"Praxis II Business Education (0100) Exam Secrets Study Guide: Praxis II Test Review for the Praxis II: Subject AssessmentsDo not waste your money. Amazon's price is great! But the book will do nothing for you, it is not set up as well as the Praxis I at all. Get books for each of the subject area(s) on the test and you will do much better. The ETS Praxis II Business test (0100) is not worth the paper it's printed on."
4,Business Education Guide - a great study guide,I needed to review business topics I studied around 20 years old. This guide provides sample test questions and an outline of what you need to study for the Praxis2 business test. It is clear in its instructions and easy to follow.
5,"Good ""base of study"" start from","The book gives you a great place to start from to begin preparing for the test. Make sure that you give yourself enough time to study though, because there is a lot to cover. The book gives you the main topics and it is up to you to get the details. The practice test inside is a great help and insight as to what you need to know. Good luck! ^_^"
3,Book Review,"I had to send this book back because it is the same one that I already have. The cover is different on the website, but when I got it, it was the same one that I have!"
1,I should've read the reviews,This is not what I expected at all! It's barely a review at all. Just a short practice test and and outline of all the things you need to go back and study from other books.
4,The training begins,"In this volume Toriyama finally starts to understand who his characters are. Kuririn shows up to be Goku's rival, Lunch adds comic relief, and Sami-Sen'nin shows more then just his dirty side. The art has improved a lot as well. We are starting to get that ""can't wait of the next page"" feel. The book ends with the start of the first tournament."
4,READ THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There is a boob scene which is kinda wierd asking bulma to do a ""puff puff"". But is is my favorite vol. and i hope you like it! EEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNJJJJJJJJJJOOOOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I enjoyed it,This was Awsome i have all the Dragon ball vol 1-16 and this is one of my Favorite i highly recoment it
2,Great Chinese poems reduced to doggrel,"This study of classical Chinese poetry tries to introduce Western readers to Chinese poetry beyond the Odes. The essay part is a good general introduction, but the translated poems are rendered as second-rate doggrel, which is hard to read and nearly impossible to appreciate."
2,"bland, though skilled","I would have to classify this as a generally good effort that shows promise. The main problem is that the whole album has an un-self-conscious campy, melodramatic quality that is downright annoying. The lyrics are self-serious to the point of absurdity, made all the worse by the singer's tendency to pronounce words in a ridiculously exaggerated way (e.g. in the first track ""Les Innocents"" he incessantly pronounces ""passion"" as though the last syllable rhymes with ""gone"") The music is mediocre, not terribly inspired, though well-played. The title suite is not too bad. The last four songs, though, are really bland and drag the album out. 2-3 of them should have been dropped, and this would have been a 3-star effort. Yes, there is some Kansas sound in the music, but the main influence sounds like Jethro Tull, particularly as one song is an actual reel, like something off of the ""Heavy Horses"" album. Except, of course, this album has none of that Tull irony and wit."
5,No toxic smell - like ziploc bags,"These are excellent storage bags. We started looking for alternative storage when we noticed the toxic smell from the ziploc brand bags we had purchased for years. Sometimes we could notice a wierd taste from some of the food. We experimented and found this was not the case when we stored the bags with other products - hefty and glad and some store brand. We don't want our food to taste like plastic, so we started buying glass containers to store things. These glad bags seem to be fine, or at least we don't notice anything. So be aware, that toxic smell may mean something bad or may mean nothing at all. As for my family, it will not be a part of our diet."
2,deceptive name,I bought these assuming that zipper meant they had a slider tab... oops.They are okay as sealer bags but DO NOT have a zipper slider.
3,OK,I like these videos in general but my daughter likes volumes 1 & 2 better than this one. I thought the monkey head lice segment was a little wierd.
3,"Good for rowdy kids, but doesn't hold interest.","The idea of this video is excellent. I really thought it would be great for helping to clam my 2 daughters, ages 5 and 2. Both of them like the idea of what they call ""baby yoga"", but they lose interest after about 15 minutes. The 5 years old does better and I have high hopes that continuing to use this video will grow her interest. Great company and video, just may need more exposure."
4,A new routine for my girls,"My daughters (2 and 4 years old) enjoy doing the poses and breathing like different animals. My favorite thing about this DVD is that it gives kids ideas about what to do when they are feeling angry, nervous or sad. My oldest likes putting a rubber ducky on her tummy and see it go up and down and she breathes in and out. I am looking for ways to help her relax because she is more on the anxious/nervous side.We have a new routine now: every morning, before the rush of getting ready for school, we do a bit of yoga. I trust that it will be beneficial for them, and for me too!"
5,Yogakids,"Arrived faster than anticipated. DVD in great condition, no problem with playing. Kids, ages 2,4,&7, loved the DVDs; they could follow along very well."
4,Almost as good as YogaKids2,"We bought YogaKids2 first and loved it so much that I went back to buy this version. While it is still amusing and fun to do, there are a lot of visual cutaways from the kids which tends to distract from the yoga itself. As another reviewer said, there is a lack of transition from one move to the next. I also thought there could be more of the calming time near the end. Unfortunately, you get through the calming time and then when the credits roll they show the kids being silly again, which kind of defeats the purpose. Generally, though, this is a good introduction to yoga for kids - the kids are cute and entertaining and the poses basic enough to try."
5,Great yoga DVD for little kids!,"I put this yoga DVD in for my nephews age 3 and age 6 before bedtime last night (I was babysitting and needed them to calm down). The 6 year old did a little better following along with the breathing and poses. Towards the end of the DVD he even said, ""I should have done this instead of freaking out . . ."" (he had had a big tantrum the day before). He even made up some of his own poses. He called one the ""raindrop.""The 3 year old mostly watched his brother or tried to knock him over, but he did keep up with the breathing, especially the ""dragon"" breathing part.I would really recommend this DVD. It's really fun. It helps kids get their energy out and calm down. They learn balance, coordination, and how to calm themselves down through breathing."
3,Just Alright,"This video seems very old and my toddler picked up on it. It doesn't look or feel like current videos. It's a little too strange for my linking. That said, there's nothing really wrong with it...I'd just choose somethign different if I'd had a chance to preview it."
3,His life is an inspiration,"This book reminds me of ""The Time of My Life"" by Willard Van Orman Quine. It reads as a history of travels and concerts with occasional comments regarding philosophical attitudes towards political events, wars, Nazi invitations, insults by Belgian musicians, and wives. So we have a great man who was a great musician and composer and did great things in his life for people and the arts and the description of this life is adequate but fails to strike me as a great work of art in itself. Hmm. T'is a puzzle. His life is an inspiration but the book is not."
1,Over priced item,"I was so angry when I saw the box and the envelope where this extra extra extra expensive Bolo tie was shipped to me that I do not recommend to any person to buy a Bolo tie from this seller. My family could not believe that a person asked more than 50 dollars for this Bolo tie. It is unbelievable, the product is very small, the cord is so thin, the quality is minimal,and the coin is laminated and the plastic wrap is so cheapy that i will never use this Bolo tie.I wasted my time, my money and my expectations. I have been a nice customer in Amazon.com but now i will not trust Amazon like I did before, sorry but I will stop buying in Amazon, the last 2 products that i received are really a waste of money and time same opinion from my family and friends."
5,Black lacquer planter,I am very pleased with this beautiful planter. It is an eyecatching piece which enhances the decor of the living room.
5,fun to see it again,"My husband and I have been buying DVDs of the older television shows that we have enjoyed. This is a well-written, well-acted drama that is sometimes a bit kooky. It's fun to watch without commercials."
3,The show is fantastic but the DVD is not that great.,"Firstly, my star rating has to do with the quality of the DVD and not the show. The show despite the shoddy treatment on DVD is still engaging and holds up after 20+ years (very few Dramas can say that!) The DVD quality however, sigh. The picture isn't great and the sound is kind of fuzzy/tinny. The menu maze is kind of tedious. I prefer a ""play all"" feature, which this DVD does not have. Also, I'm not crazy about the dual disc either.The special features are okay but not great considering folks have been waiting so long for this DVD collection's release. Little stingy.I hope that the next seasons' release will have better features, better picture quality and better sound quality.content: five stars, no doubt.picture: 3 starssound: 3 stars, even with a quality system, it's tinny.special features: 3 stars."
4,Great Show,"I'm too young to remember this show. I got the gift for my mom, but I have enjoyed it almost as much as her. It's amazing to see how many now-famous actors were in this! I hope other seasons come out!"
5,St. Elsewhere,"I ordered this for my wife, who watched it when it was originally on. However, I, too, have really enjoyed watching it. One of the aspects I enjoy is seeing Howie Mandel then and seeing him on Deal or no Deal now.I really hope they come out with the other seasons and that you have them available."
5,Finally ! The best TV series EVER is on DVD ! ! ! !,"Although it has been 20 years since I have seen this show, I remember it is the best ever. I was in my 20's, living in the city, and I would blow off a night of clubbing to stay home and watch it (the only TV show I would ever do this for). It really had a heart and soul. It was also very funny in places. Some of the scenes have really stuck with me like when Dr. Craig yelled at Dr. Ehrlich during heart surgery telling him, ""Watch what your are doing, your are not cutting a roast here!"" It will be interesting to see how the series has withstood the passage of time. I know I am pre-ordering the series and I can't wait to see it again. If you have ever seen the show, you know what I mean. If you haven't, check it out. I am sure you won't be disappointed."
1,The lone dissenter?,"I am probably the only person who was not impressed with this series. After reading glowing reports for years, I finally purchased season 1. Sorry, but ER beats this by a mile. There were some really stupid scenes, also: the idiot who acts like a bird was absurd, but went on for several episodes. The pompous heart doctor got old quickly, even tho that may be true in real hospitals. The magic was just not there for me. In fact, I stopped watching after disc 2."
1,"One of the best shows ever, technical quality abysmal!","My review title pretty much says it all. For me, St. Elsewhere is one of the best television shows ever, and watching it again is a wonderfully nostalgic experience. That said, the technical quality of this DVD set should be a total embarrassment to Fox and the series producers. The picture is washed out and SNOWY like a Vhs taping of a poor quality over-the-air broadcast. Absolutely shameful, especially for a series that was carefully (if I recall) originally produced on photographic filmstock. I cannot understand the overall high rating this DVD set is being given by Amazon reviewers. WE DESERVE BETTER, PEOPLE!"
1,"Over-Priced, failing to deliver sufficient information","This book contains little information per page, prefering oversized graphics and white space. I feel the money could be better spent to buy several books with more information. Dillman leads the buyer to believe that secrets will be revealed, yet the book barely scatches the surface of Pressure Point Arts. Better are the books by Yang Jwing Ming, such as ""Shaolin Chi Na""."
3,Additional material for the DKI system of PP fighting,"An interesting expansion to Mr. Dillman's original book, covering the use of a few additional acupoints on the human body."
4,good information,This book contains good information on pressure point techniques.Although in a real combat situation I would only consider them a bonus and not rely on them as a first line of defense.
5,The Little Death,"What an under rated Band. If you have not heard anything from Ruth Ruth check them out. They really do rock. Not sure why they are not better known, I have several of their Cd's all are great."
2,Let's get real...,"Total Choas had a good early album... but this is just fashion. How anyone could really get into more than a couple of these songs is beyond me. The album, on a whole, is boring. I'd rather eat nickels than put this one on agian. Funny thing is, I've had this record for more than ten years now... I can't give the thing away!"
5,heart toe ring,I received this product in a timely manner and it was packaged very well as not to damage the product. This was exactly what I ordered.
4,Nice Toe Ring,"This is a nice little toe ring for the price. When I first ordered it, the wrong itemwas sent. But once I returned it, I did receive the correct one very quickly. I dowear it almost every day, and it seems durable."
3,it's all right,i like the story and plot and the cutscenes but the only hard part about it is that it won't let you cheat and go on the next level like in tie fighter and there's not really all that much you can do besides shoot things with lasers when you should be converting it to engines and using misiles or torpedoes that's all i have to say
5,Still the best!,"Get the revised edition if you can. It has three band sampler projects at the end that are worth the cost of the book in themselves. No stitcher of counted thread work should be without this book. Illustrations are large and clear, and there is plenty of helpful advice."
5,Word on the Street,"I must say I am totally impressed with these guys. This album has a lot of different types of listening music from laid back, to the ladies, reggae feel, jouvert. A lot of the tracks are very lyrical. I love the tracks Carnival Darlin, War Contract, Karnamania, Sincerely Boo, Muddy Angels o.k. I practically love all. Treason definitely have the appeal for international. I recommend buyers to get this one as you would be amazed by the varied talent of these guys. Keep up the good work guys. Looking for your album release party in Canada."
3,meh,"This knob is intended to mount through a surface such as your dash. It does not appear to have a self contained, external mounting option like the RF brand ones do. It appears to be of sufficient quality. I purchased this to use with a MTX Thunder 81000D amplifier with the phone jack style plug instead of the newer wide network cable style. The proper one was discontinued by mtx. This functions as a replacement but appears to not have a sufficient range to be a 100% match. You can make adjustments but it is within the middle 50% of the range I believe it should have covered; you can adjust the gain higher on the amp and that seems to shift the range your adjusting in. So, buy it if it's for your amp; if you have a mtx, it will work but I might try the Polk audio or phoenix gold brand ones instead."
5,"Anything you want to know, and some you don't...","I bought this book as a resource and an overview of XP Home Edition. I got much more than I bargained for. I read the entire book, cover to cover (skimming parts that didn't apply to me, of course); and over-all I found the book to be written in understandable language and in a tone that will appeal to many lay readers of computer literature. The authors have done an excellent job of relaying technical information in a way that is not stuffy and actually holds the reader's attention (most of the time). This is worth the money."
4,A candid look at the real problem.,"This is a wonderful, Christo-centric look at the issue of racial issues in the church. By recognizing that reconciliation begins with a personal relationship with Jesus, the authors avoid many of the oft-tried and oft-failed attempts at racial justice. Christ Jesus, who reconciles us to the Father, is the one who reconciles us with each other. It is candid and refreshing, a call to unity in the body challenges the stereotypes of different races. We are forced to look at ourselves as God views us, as people created to reflect his glory in our salvation through Christ. The only concern is some questionable exegesis, in which the authors draw out of the text things which I do not believe are there. But the conclusions they come to are biblical. I would suggest this book to all, and it is suitable for small group discussion."
1,Welcome to bible study class,This is a perfect book for people who just want to read about bible study and do jack diddly. There isn't a whole lot of openmindedness... just .. be reasonable.. see it my way... the only way... the X-tian way.
5,Best whey protein I've used,I love this whey protein and I love the berry flavor. It tastes wonderful in smoothies and even on its own. This is a really high quality product and I think it is worth the price. Not chalky or full of cheap ingredients like some of the mainstream brands.
5,Great Reference for EIT Test,"This book is the exact same one that will be given at the EIT exam. Although you will not be able to take this book into the exam (they will provide one for you), it is nice to get familiar with what equations/tables will be provided at the test."
1,Disappointed,"I bought these about 2 months ago after reading the reviews on Amazon. I purchased these speakers in white for backyard installation once our pool was finished being constructed. They arrived and I put them in the closet and pulled them out today to install for the July 4th holiday. When I took them out of the box, one speaker was fine with no blemishes. The other however has black scuff marks all around the edges and the numbers '190' written in black marker about 3"" high on the grill. It seems they sent used speakers or factory seconds. Unfortunately I cannot return them since it's been over 30 days. While the sound may be good, I bought these as ""new"" which is not the case..."
5,Awesome speakers for the price!,"I purchased a pair of these speakers based on the the glowing reviews. When they arrived, I was immediately impressed with the quality of their construction. The euphoria continued when I hooked them up and listened. After a week of continuing to be impressed, I ordered two more sets. The speakers competently fill a large outdoor area with quality sound and cost much less than similarly sized outdoor speakers from more recognizable brnads. Does the manufacturer know it could charge a lot more and get away with it? :-)"
5,"Fun, and Useful Portable Puzzle","I have always looked for something that was portable that I could do 1000 piece puzzles on, but I have never found anything, until now. This portable puzzle holder is big enough for 1000 piece puzzles and it is easy to move. If you have some pieces already put together, it is no problem moving them, because they stay put while you move the case. I am so happy with my purchase, and I know that it will last a lifetime."
3,A Bit Small,"This is a very nice product; however, it seems that the puzzles we like are always about two to three inches too large for the carrier. For smaller puzzles, it's terrific."
5,I love it!!!!!,"I am so glad that I bought this so now I can really get into my puzzles. As per another review, when you hold it by the handle the puzzle slides down but I will use a piece of foam or something for when I want to travel with it. I did see it on another website for less money but hey you only live once right!"
5,Great Puzzle Solution,"This is a great product. Easy to put a puzzle together on, keeps it all contained, and prevents lost puzzle pieces! Also, helps keep little kids and/or animals out of the puzzle. Works great!"
5,Guerrilla's are the way to go!,"I picked up this book because I work in the automotive sales industry, and I have been very impressed with everything that is contained in its quick-to-read pages. It is filled with ideas for anyone who is ever in any type of sales or negotiating situations, which is really everyone. The anecdotes are fun to read and filled with practical ideas, and the insights into human psychology are astounding. I highly recommend this book to ANYONE!!"
1,"DON""T ORDER THIS: 8 months and still no magazine delivery","I ordered California Garden sold by Magazine Express,Inc in March 2009 as a gift, and they have not delivered any magazines to my sister as of November 2009. I paid the $20 magazine subscription and the website says I may not receive a refund. This is bad business and don't want anyone else to get this horrible service.California Garden"
5,GREAT,"THE BOOK IS WHAT IT IS DESCRIBED TO BE AND BETTER. I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE VERY INFORMATIVE. IF THINKING ABOUT BUYING, DO IT! ANYONE GETTING INTO RACING OR WANTS TO EXPAND THIER KNOWLEDGE I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK"
2,Beware of offensive language,"The author, Jack Gantos, relates how, as a young adult, he became a drug user and smuggler. He was arrested, did time in prison, and eventually got out and went to college, all the while hoping to become a writer.Throughout the book the words ""pissed"" and ""ass"" are used with some frequency, and the author talks openly about his use of drugs. The ""F"" word is used as well and some descriptions constitute this book as for mature readers only. Interesting, but not appropriate for a middle school."
4,good but short,This book is an interesting read but is short and very easy to read as it is young adult literature. I wouldn't let a young pre teen read it because there a a lot of discussion about drugs in the book. At the same time it really details how one bad decision can have a major impact on your life.
4,great read!,"I personally thought this book was great. I love reading true stories about people and the obstacles they went through to succeed. Some subjects in the story are not for young kids, but would be understood by junior high grade levels and above. I honestly think adults would enjoy this book just as much. The story has a moral that anyone can accomplish their dreams. This book is also a sibert award a winner."
5,Hole in My Life,"Jack Gantos has written the story of the 15 months he spent in prison in the early 70s and the events that led up to his incarceration for drug snugging. The book is divided into three parts: his life immediately before his smuggling adventure, his trip in a sailboat from the Caribbean to new York in a sailboat filled with drugs, and his time spent in a Federal Penitentiary. The first two parts of the book are mildly humorous and not entirely believable. The description of life in prison in the third part are horrific and should scare everyone to stay on the straight and narrow path."
3,-Funny Film For What It Is-,"I picked this one up for $2.87 including shipping and really wasn't expecting much. It's actually pretty funny. The acting is not the greatest, and the plot is stupid but for $2.87 it's not bad. I will watch it again, and I have seen a lot worse that cost me a lot more."
4,Enjoyable,Irene Dunne does a good job in two of these movies and the others are very enjoyable as well .
2,Icons of screwball comedy vol. 2,"Excellent films but dvd quality poor, again it would get stuck before loading and required several attempts to get the movies started."
4,Good modern punk is hard to find...,"I was in a small record store that was playing the Turks' album ""Pissin' Out the Poison,"" and I HAD to ask who it was! The lead singer is definitely an Iggy & the Stooges fan...very reminiscent of an early Stooges era Iggy Pop. Soon after picking that album up I found their first release from Epitaph, and it didn't disappoint me at all. I'd have to say ""Hammerless Nail"" is my favorite- ""Professional Againster"" and ""Jukebox Lean"" are great tracks as well. Hell, the whole album is good. I don't find much modern-day punk that I like, but this one is an exception. (Check out Anti-Flag, too.) If you like fast-paced punk with a Stooges sound, this one's definitely a go!"
5,Fantastic reading,"This is the first sailing book that really beautifully combines adventure, travel-logue, family and humor all wrapped up in a simple, intelligent and creative narration. Dave Martin takes us truly on an epic journey, from Bermuda to Iceland, to Scotland and Norway, with countless stories of friendship and peril along the way. I laughed out loud probably 30 times reading this book, and felt tears welling up almost as many. I was a fan of Dave's ariticles in Cruising World while the Martins were circumnavigating, but this is much more mature. The book winds around and through your heart. I didn't want it to end. GREAT Book!!!!!"
5,Five stars - but no photos or real info on their boat!,"Five stars --all the reviews below say it all well!-- but was disappointed that the publishers included no photos of the Martin's amazing trip to the beautiful far north. And no technical specs on the boat or gear, that cruising sailors might want to know about. Great story full of life, adventure, fine people, and cruising."
4,Very good simulation game,"Very good simulation star wars game....which started alot of it all!!!so what it is 2d, who cares?:).Its the gameplay and great story line that matters within this game and I reccomend it for any star wars gamer!!!:)"
3,Fun,A fun version of The star wars saga. A great side story you are involved in when you find yourself in the middle of a secret base from the Dark side of the force. All around fun game to play!
5,This game rules!!!!,I love this game!!!! The graphics are pretty good and the game play rules!!!!!!!!! There are lots of movies and all of them are cool or funny. I recomend a joystick to play but a mouse is good to. A must for all Star Wars fans. (and i'm not kidding!)
1,"Note that I am reviewing ""Rebel Assault"" the original here.","I love ""Star Wars"" and related games! I recently bought ""Rebel Assault"" for the PC, and, frankly, it is an assault on my good taste as a gamer! I would rather play the original ""Space Invaders"". This game is horrible and should have been removed from sale years ago. The graphics are poor and lack any finesse, the controls for the ships are slow and useless, the colors are gaudy, and, combined with the lack of definition caused by the poor, smugdy graphics, really hurt your eyes. ""Rebel Assault II"" has to be better than this. I wish I has that instead!"
5,A little known jewel,"My children, now 6.5 years, have loved this book since they were 4. It's simply and wonderfully written, has a number of great messages between the lines, introduces non-Latino kids to a bit of language and culture, and the illustrations are delightful as well as quite brilliant. We notice new things in the pictures every time we read it, which adds a treasure-hunt aspect to our readings. This is one of my daughter's all time favorite books."
3,Falls Short of Promise,"Ryan has created a wonderfully wacky grandmother in this tale of mice and beans. However, it falls short of its promise when readers are left trying to figure out just how and why she concludes she's had a bit of help in preparing the pinata. Vibrant illustrations help the text, but again, a single piece of candy near a mouse hole really doesn't add up to sufficient evidence to draw such a conclusion. Disappointing."
4,You don't have to be a scholar to appreciate this book,"If you have an interest in how we got our definitions of faith in Christianity, you would be well served to read this book. It is not a ""story"" per se, however, and it will only give you an overview of the process as it has occurred over the centuries. Also, Pelikan is VERY academic in his language and presentation, so you might get a little lost from time to time among his lists and examples. However, if you can stick with it, he drives his points home with precision, and rarely is an issue raised with just a single example or reference, so you will get the gist of what he's saying, even if you can't follow everything.I came away from this work marveling at the surprising UNITY of the very diverse (on the surface anyway) orthodox Christian faith through the centuries, and feeling that it was very hard not to see the hand of God in it. Pelikan knows this subject like (I imagine) no one ever has. He speaks from an authority that is remarkably."
1,Don't bother,"We actually got these speakers free after rebate from circuit city last year. We bought 2 sets, one for my parents house and one for mine. At my parents house in the middle of the night a loud hissing sound was coming from the speakers. We figured out that if you leave them on for more the 20 minutes, they just start making noises.The set we have at my house is not much better. At least we dont have that loud noise, but we did have to tape the 'on' button down on the remote.Personally, I think these are junk. don't waste your time."
4,Still need to see more...,"Here we still have the characters developing as in volume 1, so I need to see the rest of the series to make heads and tails out of this story, but since the distributor seems adamant on keeping us in the dark, it seems I will have to wait another two years for the next volume. I've heard it said that this is an excellent series once you get to the middle of it, when the story comes together and all the whimsical stuff takes some meaning (!?). I just hope I can see it complete before I die!"
2,wierd,"I have bought alot of software, this is the first time I had to research an installer software from a 3rd party. Well I am stuck with it now, I don't recommend this software. It should've come with the installer for ease of use."
4,My fuzzies love it!,This moist ferret food is great stuff. My little fuzzies gobble it up like crazy. The only reason for the four-star rating is that this food gives them the runs. It's best used as a complement to a non-moist food such as Marshall's. I mix them both together so that the little guys can enjoy both without it affecting their stool.
4,Relationships within a family,"By far a great film, well made though it has some Homosexual content, it has something for a wide audience.It is a great story that caught me more than Brokenback moutain. The depth is deeper and the development of Characters as well as the family. It shows the suffering of a man who is suffering a disease with no apparent cause. The difficulty of facing endless trials and error in trying to manage the disease and how that becomes what unites two brothers who were estrange. I would rate this as an extroadinary film and worth seeing."
3,decent slip-on,"I like slip-on shoes. This one is comfortable, and does the job, but its approximately 6-month wear-out time is about par for the course. They're cheap and you get what you pay for."
2,pretty much a stinko,I really didn't like this book. It was Mostly all talking and the only intresting parts were at the end. what a stinko!!!!
3,readible,"it's not a complete waste of time. It's actually kinda annoying how the author throws in enough unanswered questions to make the reader keep reading. But that's pretty much the only reason to finish the book. The characters are okay, the concept is okay, the story is okay. The solutions to the problems are forced and come too easily.But it's not horrible. Give it a try and you'll see."
4,MIdnight for Charlie Bone,"I think Charlie Bone would be a good book for the younger group mabe fourth through sixth graders. It goes in to some detail.It is some what of a mystrey book but a also a suspence novel. It has a good amount of characters and enemies in it.It is about a familie over in the midle east i think Egland, and his familey the yewbeans have a special thing. They all have like a differnt thing they can do in example his uncle has this talent of making lights britter and busting them. Then his ants come and he has to do this test to see if he has any sorta powers and he does they found out that he can listen to pictures. so his ant sends him to this school then after that he gets quat in every thing. Thats whewn every thing begiens. I do recomend this book for the younger adduience.by:Preston,AKA,Skittles"
1,BORING,"I have read many of my kids books with them, this series is awful. The writer seems to have absolutely no idea of where to take the story from one paragraph to the next, she blathers around, occasionally adding some to mystery, but providing no clues. There is really not much to attach to or get involved with. The characters never take shape except to be called ""odd"" or ""strange"" or ""a big girl"". These books are obvious derivitives of Harry Potter and Lemony Snicket, without the writing ability of a dimestore hack. The author should abandon this series and go back to writing recipes for fast food restaurants."
3,Ripoff or Homage?,"Either an homage or a ripoff of Harry Potter (depending on how much you like the book), Midnight for Charlie Bone follows Charlie as he discovers his ""endowment"": the ability to listen to what was being said as photographs are taken. This supposed gift causes the sinister Yewbeams to enter Charlie's life. When Charlie is sent to Bloor's Academy he soon finds all is not well. Considerably darker than Harry Potter, the book introduces a large cast of characters some of whom will no doubt play larger parts in the books to come. Lacking much of the majesty and sense of a well thoughtout world that give Harry Potter so much of its charm, many Harry fans will no doubt like the many similarities, and some will no doubt like the darker tone of this book.The narration on the audiobook can be hard to understand at times, but the narrator does a mostly good job of breathing life and personality into each of the characters."
3,A Harry Potter Wannabee,"This book was most intriguing, and quite thrilling but if you've red the Harry Potter series, this book is very predictable and not very understandable. Also, for those Harry Potter fans this book might become a bit dull because it's got the same theme. A sort of wannabe. However, if you have not read JK Rowling's work, this book is a thriller!"
4,Good Book,"I think that this book has some similarities to Harry Potter, but it's not completely the same. The book is a bit predictable and all. I liked the book, but think that it is better suited for younger kids. For an older person, it is a nice, quick read."
5,Where is the second? I want it now!,"I am so glad I read this book! I got set in a trance after reading the first page. I read it in two days, that is how good it is. Jenny Nimmo got me so involved in the story that i got angry when Charlie was angry or the same with sad or excited. Now i have to wait until September for the second. That is a long time to wait for a good book.Charlie is one of the endowed, which means he must attend Bloor's Academy. He is searching for a lost baby, but where could it be?I am sad i finished it now, but i am passing it around to my friends! PICK UP THE BOOK NOW!"
3,No conflicts in book.,"This book has a good storyline but the book does not have any action. When that action does come, it is over in like a page. The author does a good job describing everything in detail but it does not give good details on the action parts."
4,Midnight for Charlie Bone,The book that I am reading is Midnight for Charlie Bone. This book was written by Jenny Minmo. It is great. Charlie finds out that he can hear people talk in pictures. It all starts when he is making a card for his best friend and his mom is going to blow up a picture for the front and he gets a picture with a man with a baby on the front. Now his aunts find out about that and they are sending him to a special school for this so he can become very good at what he does or can do. Charlie goes out to find the people that the picture belongs to. When he finds them he gets a present for his friend so that he can go to his party that day. I don't want to give it away but this book is great this book and I would give it five stars. I would recommend this to a friend. You should try it and you'll like it.
4,Definitely a good pick,"This was a wonderfully smooth read. Though it wasn't particularly astonishing, I enoyed it and the rest in the series quite a lot. This is Fantasy/Magic but everybody will be able to enjoy and understand it. I defintely recommend this book - and the rest. It may not become your favourite, but it will earn a spot on your bookshelf."
5,This book is Great!!!!!!,"I loved this book. There is no word to describe how thoroughly great this was! Harry Potter was a really good book, and this book was like Harry Potter with the whole magic thing, but otherwise the plot was totally different. So Harry Potter fans, read this book!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I was hugely disappointed by this book. The writing is only average, at best, and the plot left a lot to be desired. There are big holes in the plot that aren't explained. Too many characters are introduced too quickly at the school, so I was confused. I big final climax in the old ruin was not very exciting. Big disappointment. I won't read the rest of the books in the series."
1,all the negative reviews are true,"After seeing the high rating of this book I had to join the comments. This book was easily one of the most boring books I've ever read. In the first few chapters we get the promise that Charlie will soon go to an awesome magical boarding school, so i read on hoping the book would get more interesting. It didn't. In fact Charlie didn't go to the boarding school until late in the novel, by which point I'd lost interest, and the school turned out to be a unimaginative knock-off of Hogwarts."
5,The Lost Child,"Charlie finds out he has magical powers, has to go to a special school, and learns of the mystery involving a girl. Charlie has many friends at his new school, but he has enemies, too. Join him in his search for a lost girl named Emma who can fly. This book hooks you into the series ""Children of the Red King."" This is a great book for kids and adults, espicially if you like any of the Harry Potter books."
3,not that good,"Midnight for Charlie Bone was an ok read.The characters are not as well developed as I would have liked,but as an older reader I must take into account that the book was written for children.I thought the first 100 pages moved to slowly,and when things did start getting good nothing was as fleshed out as it should have been which left me not really caring what happened to the characters.This is unfortunate because given the proper attention by the author this could have really been a great book,but with this mediocre first offering I don't believe I will continue reading the series."
1,Grim,"I have tried to read this book twice now and get stuck a third of the way in, mostly because of the unrelenting grimness. All the adults are evil or off somehow, or ditsy (the mother) and it leaves me feeling like I have fallen in tar. No rhythm, such as found in Harry Potter for instance, jusst constant darkness. It overwelmed the actual story."
5,Great addition to any home Library,Midnight for Charlie Bone was one of the best books that I'v read this year. It grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go of you untill the end. This book has earned its place next to some great childrens book series such as The Harry Potter series and the series of unfortunate events. I cant wait for the next book in september and will an avid reader of Jenny Nimmo from now on.
1,Way to much like Harry Potter,"While waiting for the incredible Harry Potter books to come out I have read a few other good books. This is not one of them.This book is so much like Harry Potter (in a bad way). Don't listen to other reviewers saying its not. He can hear people in photographs (talking paintings in HP) goes to a boarding school for it and becomes friends with a boy and girl. And by the way, his parents are dead and he lives with weirdos, must I say more.But unfortunately the only thing not like Harry Potter is the poor quality of the plot. The descriptions and conversation make it Boring with a capital B.Do yourself a favor. Read Cornelia Funke, Eoin Colfer, and Lemony Snicket while your waiting for J.K.'s masterpiece, not some junked up version by Jenny Nimmo."
2,COMPLETE HARRY POTTER KNOCK OFF!,"This book is so much like Harry Potter that it is sickening! I love fantasy (especially Harry Potter) and this is such a disgrace that it leaves me lost for words. Charlie discovers he has a magical talent. He goes to Bloor's Acadamy (knock off of Hogwarts.) He meets a boy with a large comical family (sounds like Ron to me...) and a bold girl and together they have adventures. Think you've heard this before? The cool thing about this particular series is the idea that the endowed have different and interesting powers that are just their own. However, if you're waiting for a new Harry Potter, choose another book. If you're as big as a Potter fan as me, you'll be disgusted by this author trying to recreate her version of Harry Potter."
1,This is no Harry Potter,I'm surprised at the high ratings this book has received from other reviewers. I thought it was a sad imitation of Harry Potter and I only got finished it because I try to finish every book I start. I didn't mind the lack of originality so much as the lack of a coherent plot. I honestly couldn't follow what happens in some of the chapters--and I don't care enough to go back and try to figure it out. I will not be reading the sequel or recommending it to my students. I am a middle school English teacher and enjoy reading Young Adult fiction.
4,A great book!,"This was a pretty good book, i think that anyone one who is in to harry potter will enjoy this book. It keeped me on my toes the whole time and it had a very exciting climax. i would recommend this book to anyone."
2,um......,"this book, sorry to all those who adore it (for whatever reason) is SO MUCH like harry potter. for instance, charlie bone never knew he had secret powers, but one day he finds that he does......sound familiar. and then he gets enrolled in the whole bloors academy for the gifted and blablabla, much like hogwarts....theres even the sleazy bully character likie malfoy. and while were on the subject, dont u think his uncle is kind of like sirius black?? well, as u might have guessed, this book is NOT one of my favs. i do not reccomend it. at all."
2,Drivel,"I am quite amazed that this novel has an average rating of 4 stars. I had to FORCE myself to complete this book because I could only read about 10 pages at a time before being utterly bored.I believe the book started with a good premise: a boy who can ""read"" photographs. If the author had just stuck with that idea and developed it a bit more, the book could have been decent. However, the author introduced all sorts of lame plot elements and characters, all the way to the end. It was as if she didn't plan the story and just sort of made it up as she went along. In addition, the character development was shallow. I really could have cared less if any of them died. The only remotely interesting character for me was Uncle Paton.Please avoid this book. It's drivel, utter drivel."
2,The Actions,"the book had a great plot and but when reading it i felt as if the story had a blant and boring theme, also i don't feel the charaters actions where explained, i mean i know he's outside in the rain but why is he outside in the rain soaking wet.and i the main reason i didin't like it was lack of emotion i mean you can't just tell me he was mad tell me how he blad his fist clenched his teeth i felt as if i couldn't realate to the charater because i didn't know what he was feeling or thinking.truthfully i stopped reading the book right at the middle because i just wasn't gripping me. even thought it was a great story it's just it could of been written way better than it was-DMB"
5,Perfect!!!!!!!!!!,THIS BOOK IS VARY MAGICAL. I LOVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH MIGICAL STORYS. IN THIS ONE CHARLIE BONE LEARS ABOUT HIS FAMILY AND MAKES NEW FRIENDS. YOU SHOULD READ IT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!
5,got here quickly,this product was mailed to me quickly and I'm very happy with the service I recieved
4,"Similiar to Harry Potter, but more of a mystery....","This book is definitely like Harry Potter in a lot of ways -- Charlie Bones discovers he has secret powers, so he is sent to a special school for ""gifted"" children. He befriends a girl, Olivia, and an Albino boy, Billy, and they wind up in places they shouldn't be. There are other similiarities too. But this book is totally good enough to stand on it's own. It's more of a mystery, where as the Harry Potter books are more fantasy. I wish the author would have gone in to more details, especially when describing the different characters, but over all I rate this book highly. It's perfect for any one waiting for the next Harry Potter to come out!"
4,do you like magic? then start reading,"This is the first book in the Children of the Red King series. Charlie Bone is a regular ten year old boy or so he thinks. When a man in a photograph that he's looking at starts speaking to him, he realizes that he is endowed with special powers. When his grandma Yewbeam finds out, he is sent to Bloors Academy for gifted children where he meets a girl who seems some what out of it , a boy named Billy who can talk to animals, Olivia a girl very gifted in drama and Fidelio a boy gifted in music. But not all people are on Charlie's side.This book is wonderfully written and is full of fast paced excitement.It has mystery and suspense to keep you reading."
5,Love It!!,All 3 Charlie Bones that are now out are incredible. I loved reading this series. Jenny Nimmo is an amazing author and I hope she writes some more books for this series! I would recommend this series to anyone who likes the Harry Potter and the Series of Unfortunate Event Books.
5,Polish Pilots played vital role in WWII,"Fretzyngier and Matusiak have come up with a fantastically illustrated and detailed account of the role Polish fighter pilots played in WWII as part of the RAF. A wonderful book filled with photographs, images of the aircraft art details and some wonderful stories. I'm happy to say my Grandfather is featured in the book (Alksander Pietrzak) on page # 73. A great honer. A wondeful book! -- Alexander Pietrzak"
1,Terrible Movie,"I thought this movie would be good from both the trailer, and Betty White/Sigourney Weaver/Jamie Lee Curtis staring... But as it turns out, it was just really, really bad. And I'm not even that tough on movies. So awkward."
3,"Funny, but not hilarious","This movie was good, touches on some themes many of us have experienced, but it wasn't one I will buy on DVD to watch over and over again."
1,Avoid this!,This movie was so poorly written. There are just too many things bad about it to even list them. The good things? Betty White had some funny lines and the last scene with her and Cloris Leachman was funny. The dancing scenes and the revenge tactics were just silly and not needed. What a waste of not only a good cast but there was a possibility of a cute movie that was ruined by horrible writing.
3,Slightly Above Average. An Uneven Comedy.,"""You Again"" is an uneven comedy. The plotlines are ridiculous, yet the movie somehow manages to be better than average. And the credit for that has to go to the cast which is lovable. I mean, how you can hate a movie with Betty White?Sure, the hijinks in the middle part of the movie are as predictable as the ending. There are lighthearted moments as well as cruel ones. However, there is a good message to this movie about forgiving past grievances with others here. It is not a great movie, but a fairly enjoyable one despite the flaws."
3,"Betty White: ""I'm Also on the Twitter""","This movie had its moments as any rom-com should. Thank goodness for the great performances from Weaver and Curtis b/c the plot was seriously lacking. It was intentionally preposterous, but was exactly what I was expecting. I managed to stay awake the whole way through--that puts this movie in a league of its own compared to others I've seen in this genre."
2,I didnt like,I wanted to see more of Betty White and Cloris Leachmanact together. I will wait for second season of HOT IN CLEVELAND.I gave this movie away.
4,Chic Flick. Funny at times and overall OK.,"Rented for my wife. Definitely a chic flick and I suspect could be a good date night movie. Certainly funny at times and all actors are good. Plot? Predictable but that ok in a chic flic. Best I have ever seen? No. Worst? No. Do not expect suprises as there are none but with that said, enjoyable."
4,great family movie,"This was a cute, funny and at times sad movie. It should be seen with a family. Recommeded by my granddaughter."
5,Small World,This is one of the most original plots that I have seen in awhile. The lead's brother is marrying his sister's arch nemesis from high school whose mother happens to also be her mom's arch nemesis whose grandmother happens to be her grandma's arch nemesis. How they all resolve their past rivalries and help make amends makes for a refreshing and entertaining view.
3,Decent Movie,Was a pretty typical funny yet chessy chick flick. If you are looking for just a typical romantic and simple movie then you will enjoy this one.
4,Surprisingly funny,"An attractive and successful young woman finds out that her brother will be marrying her tormentor from high school, at a time when the woman was a social misfit. The tormentor is tall, thin and beautiful, and does not appear to recall the former misfit, or does she? The plot thickens when the woman's mother realizes that her former high school friend/enemy is a close confidante of the bride, and the two of them are competing with each other. This all turns out to have moments of hilarity and other instants of emotional bonding between the characters. This film was a pleasant surprise, eschewing silliness for solid comedy."
5,Awesome!,"Buy this movie, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Three of the Hollywood's best actress all in one and the movie is hilarious from beginning to end. Great family movie that everyone will enjoy...even the guys will enjoy watch this movies."
3,Not The Comedy It Was Pinned To Be,"I adore Jamie Lee Curtis and Betty White but they were totally UNDER-utilized in this film. And as for Kristen Bell... well as much as I adore her, there wasn't anything remotely funny about her role as the bitter, out-for-revenge, Marnie.The bonus section was by far the best part of the DVD.Jaime Lee Curtis, Betty White, Sigourney Weaver and Kristen Bell answer questions from fans. There's a comedic spoof in which the actors have a cat fight during an interview. And the cast have a dance party!I received a complimentary copy to review."
3,Useful but with significant errors,"This article is a useful introduction to an interesting episode of Russian history and of cannon-founding: but it has two very important errors. 1) The first name of the Armstrong referred to was not John/Ivan, but Roman (stress on the second syllable). 2) The Aleksandrovskii Foundry referred to was never 'a French operation' -- the 'French factories' were entirely separate and only existed 1765-77 -- but was always a state entreprise, set up by Peter the Great, renewed in the 1770s by Catherine the Great, and still in existence today under the name Onega Tractor Factory (Onezhskii Traktornyi Zavod -- see Russian Wikipedia: also has a correct list of the directors). T[...]"
3,Particle Physics,I didn't care for the small size of the book. I didn't realize it was a miniature size when I bought it.
4,Good Read!,"This book offers a lively review of particle physics with illustrations. The introductory notes of each chapter are useful. Many interesting topics are covered, such as: the elementary particles of matter (electron and quark); strange particles, anti-matter and dark matter in cosmology; and the forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetic force, strong and weak force).By the way, it is fascinating to know that we exist because of a series of fortunate accidents: the Sun burns at just the right rate; the stable protons (seeds of hydrogen) enables stars to cook the chemical elements essential for the Earth to be built; neutrons are slightly heavier than protons, which enables beta radioactivity and transmutation of the elements for the Sun to shine."
2,Falls Short of Achieving its Objective,The book starts well but gets about a third of the way through the topic and seems to stop. I got a taste of the topic but little statisfaction. A vey short introduction indeed.Robert Oerter's book is much better and if you have a thirst for an understanding of this topic you would be much better off with it. (ie. The Theory of Almost Everything: The Standard Model.....)
4,Good read,Simple to read and interesting explanation. Not as deeply explained as I wanted- but a good clear approach to the subject matter
3,Study guide for Psychology and Psychinquiry Text by David Meyers,"This guide did not prove to be that useful. Starting in the prologue section, there was at least 1 question that I could not answer because the answer the quide was seeking was not in the book. Fortunately, the guide gives you the answers but if you can't answer the questions by reading the book, what good is the study guide."
3,Psychology Study Guide Problem,Book is in general good condition. Answers for First 4 Chapters were gone! That's a total of 30 pages missing
1,VC++ 6 Crash course & a dab of gaming programming,"If you are a beginner with intermediate attributes(or one level up from beginner but not yet an intermediate programmer) in C or Java, this VC++ 101 crash course is for you. Sousa does not go into much detail with Dx but rather uses Mirus to deal with Directx. Which means you have to use Mirus header files to program games. Which brings questions like: Why use an intermediary? Why not go straight to the source?Although I did enjoyed Chapter 17: Data Structure and Algorithms, I do think that the book spends too much time teaching VC6 and encompasses too little on game programming.This book did not give justice to it's Title."
1,Horrible. Confusing. Waste of money.,"Please don't spend your money on this book, its terrible, the confusion will waste your time, if you have patience and understand C++ at a professional level, then this may be the book for you.I am a 15 year old looking to learn game programming, I had been learning C++ for about 6 months and decided to look at this book. I spent hours each night on 5 or 6 pages trying to decipher the confusing code left by the author. I am a very fast and good reader reading above high school level, this book was just terrible.I recommend you go with Accelerated C++ and then OpenGL Game Programming or some sort of Direct X book. The two I recommend are very very helpful and good books."
5,An excelent learning tool.,"Harbour presents everything in a simple manner with very little presumptions. He provides useful information on entering the game industry and making money from your games. Although the cd can have some trouble installing, it still makes for an exceptional learning tool."
3,Hard to get into,"I made the mistake of getting this book with no experience, It has alot of fluff(I hate fluff) and not enough work on telling you how to code."
1,Great title - should have left it at that,Completely awful from beginning to end. Self-absorbed baby-boomer whines all the day along about feminism. Listen to the book on CD and you will want to cut your ears off - midwest accent of author made the dogs howl next door.
5,An Audio/Visual Journey into Weight Reduction,"I was very excited to find this selection offered by your company! I viewed a segment of this video when Dr. Williamson spoke at a city-wide seminar on health and wellness and was eager to view it in its entirety. I was not disappointed. The visual images are inspiring (especially those of the American Southwest), while the audio component is soothing and lyrical. The combination of both encourages meditation and relaxation as well as self-confidence and self-control. Dr. Williamson is obviously knowledgeable on this topic and his approach directs one to lifestyle changes versus ""quick fixes"". Everytime I have viewed this product I have seen something I previously overlooked which enhances its message and further empowers me. Thank you, Dr. Williamson and your staff, for understanding this problem and for helping me to understand and help myself."
4,Not bad for it's day.,"It was very cool when it first came out, and would be a good buy for any fan who wants to experience the thrill of blasting stormtroopers, especially for it's current price."
2,Not bad but dated...,"When this game was released it was a great game. But it is a few years old now, and it really shows. There are much better versions available as freeware now. This game is at the level one would expect for cell phones or cheap PDAs.A gamer would be better to spend the extra money for Jedi Academy or Knights of the Old Republic."
2,"Fun, but be warned.","I am a big fan of FPS games so I bought this. I had played Jedi Knight (An awesome game) and thought this would be similar. I was very wrong. The graphics were lo-res sprites, I was stuck firing at a blob of black and white dots that was supposedly a storm trooper, and I was stuck with ""find the key, open the door"" game mechanics. Once I got used to the game It wasn't so bad. An okay game, but know what you're buying..."
1,Anita Blake series is dead...,"If you have any desire for the old Anita Blake, vampire hunter, detective, and animator, then do not get this book. In all of the previous books, there was at least a thread of the detective in the book.The percentage of the books dedicated to the old Anita Blake has steadily declined since Obsidian Butterfly. This book is 5% sex with a new guy, 5% sex with a stranger, 5% do I have a new power or not, and 85% sex with everyone else.After the last book, I commited myself to stop buying this series if the next book did not contain any of the old Anita. I will re-read the books up to Obsidian Butterfly if I need an Anita Blake fix and re-read everything after that if I need an Anita Blake gets sex fix.My only consolation is that I have spent more money on the good Anita Blake books than the bad. This author is now assigned to the list of authors I look for when at a library.:("
2,Anita Blake-Not Believable,"Tis the 2nd of te Anita Blake series that I have read. I must say, it was disappointing! Quite unbelievable actually. I like to feel something when I read a book, a kinship to the heroine, not in this series at all! Sorry I read it, glad I didn't buy it!"
1,read something else with continuity and plot,"If you enjoy ""vintage Anita"" and value a well-crafted story and well-built world, look elsewhere. Try Kelley Armstrong, Kim Harrison, Rachel Caine, Jacqueline Carey.Even better, J.R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood will knock your socks off (yes, the character names are a bit silly, but what the heck!).Sorry, LKH, I don't think this was your best effort."
2,worse and worse,"I have read every single book in the Anita Blake series, and up until the past three books loved them all. The last three books have taken this series down a road that leads towards what she's doing with her Merry Gentry series - a road that pretty much leads to (not always) softcore porn! The plot of the last few books....and I'm not sure there was a plot line to this one!...have lead no where at all. I keep reading in the hopes that the author will bring back what lured me into the first books in the series: the humor and the attitude her character displayed in the first four books was perfection. Now it's non existant.All I can say is bring back Edward and let him clean up the mess that Anita has gotten herself into!"
1,"too much sex, not enough action","I discovered this series years ago, back when Anita spent most of her time fighting vampires and other bad guys, and when Richard and Jean Claude were just interesting characters. I have been increasingly disappointed with the previous books because of the amount of sex, and talking about sex and the loss of any kind of action, you know, like hunting vampires? This one is the worst yet. Save your money! You can find better, less predictable sex between multiple partners on the internet...for free. When this book started to get interesting at the ballet with some new characters and the potential for some action, Hamilton's solution was to send Anita to the limo for more sex. There is really no point in calling this paranormal--- the only unbelieveable things about these books are how beautiful every single guy is and how extremely well endowed they are. This was the last $20.00 bucks I'm giving Hamilton!"
1,Nothing Happens,"Incubus Dreams, Micah and now Danse Macabre three books that Anita's main focus has been feeding the Arduer. I miss the Anita that did anything to get the job done or even did something interesting. No cases, no zombies, no execution. The strengths and foibles of Anita's men get repeated enough that you can skip pages and not miss a thing. The sex is also repetative and not that terribly well written. Anita now relates to all the other characters new or old only through sex. Predictably she runs the hot and cold with everyone. We get it no man will run her, she'll not give an inch to anyone please give us something new."
2,A Sad Commentary,"Like most of the reviewers, I have been a huge fan of Laurell K. Hamilton for years, but I am finished waiting for Anita to master the ardeur and move on with her life. Where is the plot that provides the framework for the story? I just finished this book and I could not tell you what the plot is supposed to be.I am not a prude, but all the sex just gets boring after a while. There is no motivating force that moves the story forward. I still don't know what Merlin was up to, or what is to happen with all of the visiting Masters. There is no resolution other than the answer to the pregnancy question.I was staying with a sick friend who is also an avid reader this weekend, and finished the book at her house. She noticed I put the book down when there were only a few pages left, in order to wash a mug she was using. A sad commentary indeed."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought the book at a used bookstore and it still wasn't worth the money I paid for it. There is no plot, there is no ending, there is nothing but poorly written sex scene after sex scene. It's not even good enough to be bad porn. There are numerous typos, words used incorrectly (the most glaring is effected in place of affected), words spelled wrongly, and grammatical errors. Considering the quality of the first 6 books and the lack in the books since, its almost as if she's not writing them anymore. I was so disappointed. I want the time and money that I spent on the book back. At least my buying it used won't up her sales numbers."
1,"""Come. We are ready for the floor show.""","Honestly, after reading this I don't know why Anita bothers to wear clothes anymore."
2,Disappointed,"I, like many other LKH fans, couldn't wait for this book to finally be released. And like many sat down and read it as fast as I could. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Where did Anita go? Throughout the series she has evolved to a stronger character, both in her police/fed marshall side and the metaphysical side. But in this book the 'cop' diappeared... Where was her gun? The entire book is held in Jean-Claude's space under the circus and was based on her developing 'abilities'. As I was reading I felt like the 'real' Anita would show herself soon, but at the end I thought Anita was portrayed as a whiny child who couldn't do anything for herself... And the sex - I felt like 3/4 of the book was sex -with new people she just met or a group.... Definitely not Anita's style unless in an immergency, not because she was pissed. But to end this review, I feel like if you have kept with the series you have to read this book so you aren't lost on the next, but don't expect much... Sorry LKH."
2,From a guys point of view,"I and my wife usually don't agree on books but the Anita Blake series was one that we fought over when we first started reading them. However, the last few books seem like trashy Harlaquin romances rather than the good writing I remember. Did someone come up to Hamilton a few years back and say ""hey, you need to add more sex to get the females to read this"". From the reviews I am reading here I see the women are on to this too and are as dissapointed.Give me the old Anita back who was tough and didn't believe in sleeping with the neighborhood."
1,Absolutely and utterly terrible,"Yes, it WAS actually possible, Anita Blake gets even more prostitued by LKH for money. This book was absolutely horrid. The plot was beyond weak and a rehashing of her last two-ish books, it has gone from a dark fantasy genre to vampire erotica and any remote basis for the original Anita so long ago is utterly destroyed.Anita is no longer likable, Jean-Claude in this book is a far cry from Master of St Louis and is boring, Richard is predictably cry babyish and all the new introductions just MUST sleep with Anita. BORING.I was VERY lucky to be able to resell this book. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. LKH just end it. Please. Go write a Merry Gentry book or something you haven't made into a mockery yet."
2,And I waited a year for this???,"I cannot believe after waiting for one year for this book how disappointed I was when I read it. Yes, some of the character development or lack thereof was interesting and the pregnancy scare was a nice plot point the rest of it just didn't seem to go anywhere. Get it from the Library if you can or at least wait until the paperback version comes out. Really not worth the $20+. Sorry Laurell but you've lost another long time fan."
1,"Boring, tedious, plotless, and annoying.","I think the title of my review says it all. These books haven't been interesting since OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY. These books haven't had a decent plot since OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY. I almost wish Hamilton would just let Anita die so I wouldn't be compelled to force myself through boring, tedious, improbable group sex scenes, all in the hopeless quest for a good story. Enough is enough!"
1,Where's the plot?,"For some very stupid reason, possibly the reviews of her last two books, I thought Hamilton would get back to creating a story line that had characters and a plot that actually went somewhere and had something to say. Anita had to take a pregnancy test. This should have made for an awesome story line. Nope, at most it was 20 spread pages spread out through the 400+. Great new characters were introduced including merpeople. Did she do anything with them? No. Was there a lot of sex. Yes, on almost every page. Did it move a plot? Of course not. Did it make sense? Not often. If you want a book, (not a story) with lots of sex then maybe this book with appeal to you. If you were hoping Hamilton pulled it together for this one, sorry. She didn't get it right this time either."
2,OMG!!!!,"Ok, this may sound silly-But I don't like the boy on boy stuff!!! Plus, Anita acts a little stupid; she acts like she is dumb as h@#%#. She's always asking questions after questions, it's a little too much for me. In addition to that, the story line could be better. I mean I love her other books, but this is just too much. It is overly sex driven!!! I hope the series turns to a brighter side and stop going down the ugly, dark, sex-driven & worshipping of Anita way!!!"
1,Plotless drivel,"...Reading through a few of the previous negative reviews of this latest Anita Blake installment, ""Danse Macabre,"" an interesting ""humanism"" kept jumping out at me (i.e. "" I'm no prude, but the sex in 'Danse' was a little over the top,"" "" I like good erotica, this is just boring,"" ""I enjoy good sex scenes in novels, this just feels mechanical"")---in other words, ""I am not PRUDISH, (heaven forbid), it's just the sex in THIS book is poorly written""....Well, I guess I AM prudish---I don't NEED LESSONS on sex, and Hamilton's focus on mechanics at the expense of plot and characterization have crucified what was once an imaginative, original creation: part Rambo/Buffy/Elizabeth Bennet--in other words, Anita Blake herself...."
3,Dragging?,"I was a fan of this series but after a while it feels kind of like the series stops going anywhere, suddenly it's more about how many possible partners can Anita have? Kind of feel like the author lost sight of something in this novel..."
1,0 stars WORST book I have ever read!,"Words cannot describe what a mess this book is. Therefore, I will just keep it short and sweet. It was so horrible that at one point, I threw the book across the room. It was just like cheesy porn with 20% plot and the sex scenes for the remaining 80%. The worst of all the AB novels and that is saying something. Read at your own risk!"
1,If you want erotica...,"head on over to the erotica section of your bookstore and buy some ""real"" well-written erotica. Seriously, this book reads like a stale instruction manual for sex addicts. Nowhere in this book is there a plot, mystery, suspense, humor...well maybe some bad humor...There are much better paranormal/romance authors out there that deserve your dollars. This is a pathetic attempt of LKH to jump ship on the horror genre and slip into erotica. Unfortunately, the sex is poorly written and, usually erotica does have some plot involved.For those that think Anita will come back from ""whoredom"" please think again. This is the 4th book like this...she ain't comin back, folks! This series needs to die...quickly!"
2,"oh, no.........","i kept reading just to see if something would eventially happen that had anything to do with somthing besides sex and anita's powers. i don't really have a problem with sex nor anita's powers, but, really, do we have to have a book that is nothing but those 2 things? i'm afraid to buy another book that might be just the same, but i'm afraid that if i don't buy another book, i might miss anita's come back. decisions, decisions."
3,Old habits die hard...,"I'll probably agree with what everyone else has said. I tend to read these books out of habit and the preverse hope that they will have changed back to the old Anita stories. I will give this book an extra star cause its better than the last book, Cerulean Sins. At least we meet more monsters (Mermaids !!!) and have a plot (possible pregnancy) but it wasn't quite enough to carry the book like old days. We are building up to Mommie Dearest waking up, but I wish it would happen already. I will continue to read these 'cause they aren't bad, but they are moving into a different genre that isn't my first choice - erotic fantasy with erotic stressed."
3,same ol' same ol',"This book (like so many other readers have said) really has no plot line, there was no killing, no mystery, no bodies. It is only a pause in the moments before the next book, which put me in mind of the last Merry Gentry novel. The ending left me very dissapointed and thinking only, ""That's it?!"" Even the sex scenes were stale. It seems like Mrs. Hamilton took pieces of sex scenes from her other books and rolled them together to form a semi-new and semi-interesting scene.Anita seems to get her way, all the time. You can only give a character too much power before it just seems a bit silly."
3,Short and not so sweet...,I am as much of an Anita Blake fan as the rest of the readers here and I do see how the bashing can occur. It's obvious Laurell's style has changed but it is up to us to say if we will take it or not. So in other words if your that diappointed then why did you buy it in the first place. It's really no different then the last three books have been.As for the book itself I wish it had more actual storyline. If the sex was cut out the book would be 20 pages long and that saddens me more then anything. I want to know the characters again we are loosing all their personality by being trapped under the weight of a rather repetive sex scene. This isn't a step up from porn. At least it shouldn't be.But as for me I will continue to buy her books from all her book series because I like her and I fell in the love with the characters at the beginning I continue to re-read her work for that very reason.
4,Nothing wrong with sex,"Yes, there is alot of sex scenes in this book. There is also alot of character development. I started out from the beginning of this series and if you enjoy adventure, mystery, and romance(sex)then these are the books for you. I thought that in her early books when anita is always rushing from one crisis to another that they often had alot of gore and blood and violence. It is not just the sex in these books that adolescents should not be reading. This series is definitly for adults only."
5,Danse Macabre,The Book was intoxicating. I could not put it down. It is one of Laurell K Hamilton's best
4,Dancing with the Vampires,"This was back to the full Anita story. Seeing her try to graple with her life as it really is, no the fairy tale she was raised to want is familiar to many of us women in the 'real world'. Ms Hamilton has returned to the original story after a couple of short jaunts into the sidelines (as with Micah) and it is refreshing and fun again. I look forward to more Anita as we find out more about Wicked Truth, how will they deal with the Church of Eternal Life, et all.Great fun, quick read."
1,Less and less,"I used to love the Anita Blake books and describe them as Detective/ Horror/ Romance novels. As the series has continued I've had to drop the detective part, and the horror....so all you are left with is kinky vampire & furry werecritter sex and romance. Plot gets skimpier and skimpier. Mystery is a thing of the past.Vote with your wallet - don't buy this and maybe we'll get some quality again.Go read Charlene Harris' Southern vampire series for something more like what the Anita series used to be. (though Anita would probably hospitalize Sookie with just a glare)."
1,Get a story!,I could go into a whole list of reasons this book didn't work for me but then I would be as boring as Anita has become. I will sum it up with an old Wendy's slogan: Where's the beef?
1,Vampire Hunter - Where??,"As so many reviews have stated..bad bad bad. I have bought all of the books, have been a fan until the end but this one put me over the edge. I sat there screaming I paid how much for this?? The plot - sex, the mystery - none, the errors - many, and if I read "" I opened my mouth to say"" one more time I think I would have chucked the book at the wall. Save your money, if you must wait for the paperback or go to the library. Maybe if sales start to decline that would be a wake up call, or maybe she just wants to be a porn writer? But my biggest question is do you think we could sue for false advertising, I mean on the spine of the book it states ""Anita Blake Vampire Hunter"" not Anita Blake Beefcake Hunter."
1,Dreadful,"If you were a previous fan of Anita's don't buy this book! There is absolutely no story to be found. A more accurate title would be Anita Does St. Louis. I'm not sure what happened with this series, its gone from great stories to unimaginative sex scenes and nothing more. Truly a disappointment.This ""book"" can pretty much be read in any chapter order you choose. It won't affect the story since there isn't one.This is also the last time I buy one of Laurell Hamilton's books in hard cover. Not even sure if I'll buy the paperback ones after this."
2,Another bad excuse to write BAD porn... I quit...,"I found this series late and was able to request multiple novels from my local library and in weeks read everything in the series. Like others have commented the writing and story quality have made a drastic turn for the worse. During the earlier six or seven novels I laughed, often out loud, at the dialog and character interaction. The stories were intriguing. The plots were interesting and gave enough twists to keep you guessing and reading. Lately, I haven't laughed, not once. This novel like the last few seem to be nothing more than an excuse to write bad, graphic, porn. Really, really bad porn. Pages and pages of really bad porn. I'm not even done with the novel (almost) but I'm done with this series and this author. I quit."
2,review Danse Macabre,"I've alway been a fan of Hamilton's books. I liked the characters and didn't mind the sex in fact it was good reading. However, the last two books have become frustrating to read.It's not so much the lack of plot or circular narrative. Or the characters, I adore them. I love the new vampires, especially Wicked and Truth. But the last two books lack fluency. One is stuck in a scene that becomes extended untill the extended part is extended and often touches on matters that are already discussed in earlier books. Especially scenes with Richard have become frustrating to read.There is way too much explantions and not enough fluency.I think it's time the Anita Blake series come to an end, because there cannot be more. Each book there is more powers more sex. And all options are explored, and it would be bad to make Anita all powerful. There's just nothing left to explore with this series.Maybe it's time to focuss on a new series. 13 books are definitely not bad for a series."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with a lot of the fans of this series who say it has gone downhill with these later books. Now, I don't mind all the sex stuff that has made it's way into the series, but I do mind that it has completely taken over the story with this latest book, Danse Macabre. With previous books there was at least some semblance of an actual detective-ish story (even if it was somewhat weak in a couple of these later ones). With Danse Macabre there just really wasn't much of anything but a party, a ballet, and a lot of sex. It was very disappointing. When I finally hit the end of the book my first thoughts were, ""That's it? Did anything even happen?"" This addition to the series left me very unsatisified.Though I have to admit, I will probably keep reading this series as bad as it is getting. I guess I just hope the tough gun-toting girl who raised zombies for a living and solved supernatural crime in her free time will reappear in the next one."
4,Ending Please,"I wish I could have given this book five stars but I did feel like the readers were cheated out of an ending. That said, thats my only complaint. I too am so tired of people writing reviews stating how they are sooooo tired of the sex scenes. Then stop reading the books! Its clear that the sex is here to stay in this series. I don't love the sex scenes but I appreciate that its important to the plot and character existence of Anita. Also someone mentioned they couldn't follow the plot in this book. The plot wasn't about violence but the emotional trials and development of Anita. I really enjoyed this book and am so sad that I'm going to have to wait so long for the next one!!"
3,Can't Put Down,Even if most of the plot has been removed from the Anita Blake Series at this point . . . I can't seem to put them down.
3,Lust among the dust(ed),"I was disappointed in this offering from Laurell K. Hamilton. She spent too much time developing the ""neverending battle to control the ardeur"" theme, much to the detriment of the plot. The storyline was a little too thin and appeared to exist only to link the continuous sex scenes. Usually I am a great fan of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter books, but I put this effort from Laurell at the bottom of my list. Let's hope she gets back to her strong storylines in her next novel."
3,Don't Buy the Audio Version!,"I bought the audiobook to re-read as the new book comes out in a few weeks. I read the book last year. I'm a huge fan of audiobooks, but this is the first Laurel Hamilton book that I've gotten on audio. That being said, I really didn't like this version. Too much overacting, corny music at the beginning and end of each disk. Just wanted to warn anyone who is considering buying this product."
4,don't know taste.,i loved all the books you said were lame. if you they get to risque. then to each his own. but yet i don't offend easily. so i say god bless if you this sderies offends you move on to onother seres. she wa sbrong without richard or new characters added . adn those who wanted everythign tame and with richard if he was gonna be wishy washy charatcter then the heck with you.
2,I wish I could rate it higher,"I'm sorry to say Ms. Hamilton just doesn't have it anymore. What began as a great series has become an uninspiring and confusing mess. The characters spend the entire book discussing their supernatural powers, interrupted only by incredibly uninteresting sex scenes. Although I simply don't find Anita Blake interesting anymore, my completist personality will of course compel me to suffer through her next book anyway."
1,Where's the story??,"I have been an Anita Blake fan since the beginning but I have to say that this last book, Danse Macabre, was a real disappointment. The last few books have been pretty thin on story-line but this book had the ""invisible plot"". I like sex as much as the next person but I wish Ms. Hamilton would get the gang-bangs out of her system and find a story. If this is what the next book is going to be like, this will be my last purchase. I notice the same trend in her other series, Merry Gentry, and am a bit tired of it there too. Where's your imagination Ms. Hamilton?"
1,What happened?,I was looking forward to this book and couldn't beleive how bad it was. If you compare it to the earlier books written it sounds like it is from a totally different writter. All the suspense and action from the previous books is gone. The book is one large thing about sex. I just hope the next ones get better.
1,Broken Record,"I've finally and forever had it! There is NOTHING new or interesting in this book. Ms. Hamilton wastes many pages on ""new"" characters while we don't even get a glimpse of some of the old favorites. I would like to see her get rid of these characters, bring back the old and give Anita a real challenge. It is a repetition of the last 3 or 4 Anita Blake books, and to be honest it reads more like erotica than a fiction novel.To echo the other reviewers, there is no plot and it is a waste of money. If you want the new info on Anita and the gang (and trust me, there isn't much), read the spoilers posted on the Internet or wait for this book to come out in paperback. Or even better, borrow it from the library."
2,I thought this one might be better,"I was really disappointed on this latest book in the Anita Blake series. I thought maybe she is having a rough spot with Incubus Dreams but after a year of waiting for something with a better exciting plot like the first 8 books of the Anita Blake series I believe that it has died out. I am not mindful of sex scenes if they have the anticipation and care in the writting but it seems now that they are just placed anywhere at any time with no real meaning for them in the plot. I really like LKH as a writter and will support her next book, but if you want to read this one I suggest borrowing it from the library or from a friend. It really isn't worth the twenty bucks. Sorry LKH but this one really stinks..."
2,am I missing something....say a plot?,"I've been a fan of LKH for many years, I faithfully buy her books and eagerly read them all. This is the first book, in her Anita Blake series, that I was really disappointed in. It wasn't all the sex, even though it is a lot like reading a very bad porn story, it's the lack of any plot. I think the plot is suppose to be Jean-Claude invites all these Master of various Cities to enjoy the ballet. Along the way Anita sleeps with more men than I can remember, thinks she's pregnant, almost shapeshifts...oh and almost dies AGAIN!! What makes this most unbelievable is, that it all happens in less than a 24 hour time period. I miss the Anita Blake of old, I miss LKH's wonderful stories and fantastic adventures, but most of all I just miss this series. I think Anita is done, and that LKH should put her to rest."
2,Danse Macabre,"I've been an Anita Blake fan from the first book. I find that now there is hardley any story but sex. I don't mind some sex but Anita has alot. I also liked that Anita was a strong female that had morales. She has lost her charm. I always loved to read these books, but I miss the crime and her working with the police. All she does now is have sex and a few fights with bad guys. The fights could fit into two chapters and the rest is all sex or talking about sex or finding someone else for Anita to have sex with."
1,Can the train wreck get any worse?,The only reason I continue to check out the books from the library is to see if each successive book manages to be worse than the one before.Yes: Danse Macabre is the worst one yet.
2,Turn for the worst,"The book is just sex. There was little conflict in the book. I loved her earlier books and I'm saddened that she had to turn the series this way. I always stood by her books before this saying that the sex in the books made it better because she had such issues with sex itself, but it went to far. There has to be a plot for a book to be any good. Still, I didn't hate the book. It was nicely written and it had it's moments. Granted, there weren't many moments, but there were some. I did finish it, and I still continue to read the series because I have hope that it'll get better. It's not aweful. It just wasn't something that I would have bought in hardcover. I could have waited for the paperback to come out on this one."
1,A weekend in the life of Anita Blake: Vampire Humper,"In a period of 48 hours, Anita Blake, partakes in a string of multi-partner sex sessions with hand-wringing, gripe sessions spaced just long enough in between for everyone to recover.I got sooooo tired of the sniveling, crying, whining, tirades of ... well almost everyone in the book. Sex - whine - sex - whine -This is the first book I have read by this author and I have come to understand that this series has taken a turn for what most fans agree to be the worse.Anita's bizzare sense of morality was annoying too as she kept 6 or 7 lovers and used them in various combinations, but was bothered by her non-human master's male-male relationships.I don't usually write negative reviews - as I try to only read books I think I'll like - but in this case, I am afraid the shoe fits."
2,6 months and still haven't finished it yet...,"Heh it's been like six months since this book has come out, and I have yet to finish it. In fact I just picked it up the other day again, since the release of the new Merry Gentry book came out. I don't know what has happened to LKH, but it isn't good. I mean if I wanted to read about sex, I would go and read an erotica book. But when one goes to read a paranormal book you expect paranormal like fangs, fur and living forever etc. But not sex this, sex with that one. Blah, I hope she takes this into consideration when she writes the next one."
1,2nd Horrible Betrayal of Her Anita Blake Fans,LKH has done it again. This book is the second horrible betrayal of her long-time Anita Blake fans. LKH is completely stabbing her fans in the back for a second time. If this system would allow it this would rate a 0. She can be such a great writer and used to make us care about the characters in Anita's world. Why would an author of a long-running series thumb her nose at her fans like this and trash her characters?
1,Hamilton is trying to kill off her own creation,"This series has just about run its course. No longer satisfied with the rich fantasy world she has created over this long series, she now seems completely intent on writing porn. Plot and action sequences are pushed into smaller and smaller importance as she writes double the sex scenes. So if you're looking for that kind of thing, this one is right up your alley. But if you're looking for a vampire hunter novel, you might want to start further back in the series."
1,I'm outta here.,"I bought Danse Macabre in the now obviously vain hope that we would see a return to the story-telling and plot that made the original books of the Anita Blake series so wonderful. Instead I found another book of badly written, repetitive sex and a heroine who I have grown to really dislike. I couldn't even finish this book. I will be returning it today. Farewell, Anita Blake. Farewell, Laurell K. Hamilton. You have both seen the last of me and my money."
2,Not even close to the best Anita Blake,"So, the major problem with this book is not the sex. As someone else mentioned, it's entertaining and important to the story line. The problem with this book is that nothing else besides sex happens! We need more plot, period. I am actually looking forward to the Anita book that deals more with mummy dearest (as Anita calls her) waking up and what happens then. Also...why hasn't Belle come to visit yet? Or why doesn't Jean-Claude and company go to Europe? These are all interesting story lines that LKH could explore...What's the deal!"
4,Danse Macbre is the best Yet,"Anita Blake is a whiny brat, but the rest of the characters are awesome. Anita is less whiny in this novel, making it easier for me to read. Story is fantastic, really grabs ahold of you."
3,What happened to the action,"Now the only action Anita seems to get is between the sheets (if she can be bothered to get to a bed) wheres Edward, wheres the intense plots the first books had? I still love the books but they have been better."
3,Good Book,"Laurell K hamilton is one of my favorite authors. But the series is not improving much. The character, Anita, is becoming too sexually active and having sex with anyone including strangers. That is not the way the character started out. I love the early books where Anita was more into fighting and killing."
4,Almost over the sexual edge,"I have loved the Anita Blake series since it's inception. I have enjoyed their almost over the edge sexuality and eroticism. However with this one, I found myself on more than one occasion thinking - enough sex - move on to something, anything, else. I hope that future AB books return to having a bit more of a plot and a bit less of simply constant sex."
3,I still find it entertaining.,"While this series has gone more towards romance and erotica than the titles before 'Narcissius in Chains' I admit I still find the series a good way to pass my time while my husband is on the computer. I still want to know what will happen to Anita next, and hope she can somehow obtain some sort of control over the ardeur. I look forward to seeing the outcome of The Mother's interest in her, having a feeling that Anita will somehow come out on top."
3,Not as good as the last one,"Ok we all know that Anita has a need to feed the ardeur, but good god I like to read just more then how many men she has to sleep with to keep the ardeur undercontrol. I want some battle going too. This one did not have any battling going on just a lot of sex and I do mean a lot. Which is not a bad thing but Anita has other things going on besides just sex most of the time.I felt this one which by the way I waited a long time for it to come out was not one of the better books. But I have to say Laura really knows how to paint a sex scence at least that part is never a let down lol."
2,No more hardbacks for me,"It's taken several books, but I'm now to the point where I'm not in a rush to find out the latest happenings with Anita and friends: from here on out, I'm waiting for the paperback. The relationships dominate the book more than ever, leaving little room for anything else. Which is fine, if you're looking for a romance novel--I want something a little meatier. No Animators, Inc, no RPIT, no mystery--just more reasons for Anita to have sex, or to be angsty, or for others to be angsty. And things are starting to repeat. She and Richard fight--again--and Richard comes to terms with things--again. The whole thing takes place in about a day, despite the number of pages, the bulk of which are taken up with introspection and relationship talk disguised as politics. I just...want more. Maybe it's a guy thing--but as a guy, I remember caring about the characters a lot more not so long ago."
1,Failure to literature,"This book is an absolute failure. Instead of a plot, there is a superfluous amount of sex. But it's not sexy or sensual. Anita makes sex repulsive. I want to see the former Anita Blake kill off the Anita in this book for making her look absolutely horrid."
2,"Sex, Sex, and oh please","I am a Huge fan of earlier LKH. All her books had great plots and even better characters. But now I don't even know what to say about all of the sex in this last book. She has the potential to write great sex scenes, if she feels that the book and the story needs them. But sometimes 200 pages of nothing but sex can get a bit boring. And the thing with Richard is getting old. Could he be more of a baby? All the new characters had potential but their stories felt a bit rushed. I guess Anita needed to be pimped out a bit more. All in all I was bummed how this book turned out. I am hoping by the next book LKH will let Anita have a story with a plot. I miss Dolph and the rest of the humans she worked with on a daily basis."
2,Big Disappointment,"I found Micha a disappointment and this one, is one also. The book was he said, she said, and how do you feel about that, instead of any action. If this trend continues I will have to leave this author off my list of things to read which would be a shame since she has been a favorite for a long time, I have read everything she has published so far."
2,"Well, Damn.","I have to agree with most reviews, but let me add a fews things.I had a lot of ""LOL"" moments in this book. That was a bit weird, but nice. I don't read these books in public anyway. What was this book about? There're too many personal problems. The characters in this book have had over 100 years to mature. Why do they whine about everything? I find it hard to believe a vampire is a scary and powerful character, when he's complaining about not getting enough attention. Everytime there's a sex scene, I yawne and wondered what everyone else was doing behind the scenes. GEES! Boring! Anita is growing in magical power but her character is weak? I wondered for the first time since I've been a fan of this series, why the bad people didn't get a bullet between the eyes. They wouldn't have been missed.This is a very disappointing read, but I'm sure you'll buy it anyway."
1,"It's not me, it's you, Anita...","I found myself in denial...skimming over PARAGRAPHS trying to locate a plot in this story. I fondly remember the gruesome details in Obsidian Butterfly-the last great plot. Good times.The sex is even tiresome now...I'm breaking up with you, Anita."
3,Steak or tofu? Where is this series headed?,"I haven't figured where Hamilton is going with this novel. First of all, we never find out why Jean-Claude has invited the other masters of cities to the ballet. Ostensibly it's so Anita can find a new pomme de sang, but the search, in spite of the sex is desultory. She also never finds a lion.My guess is that the culmination of the series will be a major confrontation between Anita(and her allies)and Marmee Noir and/or Belle. There really isn't anywhere else to go unless we get back to the action hero that Anita started out to be.The pregnancy story line was a good idea, but opening the novel with a squabble between Anita and her only female human friend sucks. I smelled the resolution of the pregnancy from Chapter one.This book isn't anywhere near as good as most of the other vampire executioner novels. I can't recommend it to any but die-hard Blake fans. It's like sitting down to a steak dinner and biting into tofu."
3,Anyone for sex?,"Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake series has gotten lost in her descriptions of wild and uninhibited sex. When the series started, the idea of who was really a monster - and who was not - was an interesting idea. Coming to accept that there could be ""good"" monsters, as well as ""bad"", was a challenge for the character of Anita. Her necromancy abilities were her way to make a living and her additional responsibility as an Executioner combined to make her a frightening person even if she was a small attractive woman. She was formidible. She was dangerous. Now, the lastest books are mainly long descriptions of sex - with vampires and with weres of many flavors. I hope that Ms. Hamilton can get back on track and give her readers some real story again - not just descriptions of who wears what and how loud Anita (and her lovers) can scream."
1,"Out damned Plot, Out!","And another one bites the dust! I'm done with reading about Anita's `sexcapades' and can Richard be any more revolting? A plot might have tempted me to read another of her books, but it was conspicuous in its absence! If you expect your books to have plots I would suggest you skip this one. If you're into `Anita Does Everyone,' this is the book for you. Sorry LKH, this ride is over."
1,Too much has changed.,"I really enjoyed the first few Anita Blake books. Danse Macabre is nothing like them. It seems to be just about sex, as far as I have read. I am not even sure that I will finish the book. The book does not have the excitement of the Anita Blake books that I have read in the past."
1,jh,"This is the worst Anita Blake book yet, I was unable to finish it.There is no story that I could discern, it's strictly a sex noveland not a very good one."
3,not that hot,"The early Anita Blake novels were much more entertaining. She had a life, there was an interesting plot.But the last few books are downright boring. I like a few sex scenes all right, but this book seems to be nothing but, and I get SO TIRED of reading about ""the ardeur"". You need a scorecard to keep track of her lovers and I get confused about all ""the feeding"" and why and how and off whom.Bring back the necromancy practice and limit the constant jumping into bed. I don't think I can stand to read anymore otherwise."
2,Is the author realy witing this book ?,"The book is auful. There is just no other way to say it. It has no plot, it has no ending, and, frankly I am just a litter tired of how many times Anita Blake has to relearn to breath, and all the metaphisical sex. It is not the I mind the sex, it just does not make any sense. Anita Blake started as one of the most imaginative vampire book series in the market up until Obsidian Butterfly, then it turned into, What? I do not even know what the books are about any more. It is a shame, althou I still think that the series can be save. Call me a positive, call me a masoquist."
1,I found myself hurrying to be done...,"I love the Anita Blake series and re-read it every time a new one comes out, but after Narcissus in Chains, I found myself working to get through Cerulean Sins, Incubus Dreams and especially Danse Macabre. Anita isn't working anymore, either as an animator or for the police and while I like sex, reading about it on almost every page of this book got really old, really fast.I hope Laurell K. Hamilton's life is happy again and Anita can get a life again, 'cause frankly, right now her life is repetative and boring to read about."
2,wheres the plot?,"The plot in this book was very thin and i really dont think the price of the book was worth the reading experiance I got, this is the first book in LKH series i have not enjoyed so maybe the next one will be better.... I dont mind the sex as long as theres a plot to go with it."
2,"Read one, Read them All","I've read all of the Anita series, and loved the first four. It was charming when she was trying to choose between her boyfriends--a vampire and a werewolf, but now there are more werecreatures than you can imagine, and the sex is there just for the sake of selling the book. This is becoming a ""read one, read them all"" series with very little action or plotting, and that's too bad. I hope Ms. Hamilton reads these reviews and tries harder, but I'm about to give up on Anita Blake."
1,Fagheddaboudit,"Based on the consumer ratings, and my increasing boredom and disappointment in this series, I am boycotting the rest of the Anita Blake series. There is an interesting series written by Kim Harrison along some of the same lines as Anita Blake, without all the trash. Title of the first of three is ""Dead Witch Walking. Like almost everyone else here, I miss the old Anita, and am finding her a distressing mess, with the storylines beginning to blur between her and the Merry Gentry character Ms. Hamilton writes about in another series."
1,Long past time to drop vampire hunter title,"I was first introduced to the Anita Blake character when I read ""Blue Moon"" in 2000. I enjoyed it so much that I nearly inhaled the previous books, and then began waiting for new titles. The quality of the series has dropped since Obsidian Butterfly, and this book is easily the worst yet. I don't mind sex scenes in a book, but I'd like some plot or story to go with it. While the pregnancy scare was somewhat interesting, most of the book seemed to be Anita whining about the ardeur. A book that long should cover more than 48 hours of Anita's life. I miss her working to solve crimes, and am a bit tired of the avalanche of new characters introduced. I'd like to see some characters from previous books return, particularily Edward.I had to concentrate to read this book because I kept getting bored. I don't recommend it."
1,LET DOWN AGAIN,"When will I learn. I had high hopes after the first half of the book, not a lot of gratuitous sex, however after introducing a slew of new characters----NOTHING---instead of an ending we get one last sex scene. what little plot that had developed was left hanging. Please, someone tell me how can any author have a 2 page conclusion that reads like a fifth grade book report..Ms Hamilton you may be the most frustrating author I have ever read!!!!!!"
2,Stop teasing us!,"Spend an hour in the bookstore with this book but don't buy it. Read the 1st 4 chapters and the last 4 chapters. The rest is bodice-ripper gothic romance. The entire book takes place in 24 hours. SYNOPSIS: Anita and Jean-Claude have ardeur sex with Augustine, Master of Chicago, and Anita *might* be pregnant by...? Everyone's powers are enhanced - some are clarified, most are not. There are a LOT of storylines left open at the end of almost 500 pages of sex: Samuel & Anita; Anita & the sirens; Marmee Noir; Jean-Claude's new powers, if any; Anita's new pomme de sang; merpeople; why the Masters came for this last performance, Belle Norte's rising power; Adonis & Merlin; Anita's 4th lyncathrope, etc. Richard is STILL a pain in *&^%. Anita has *some* character growth and Asher now has an animal to call but that could have been told in a short story.In Short: lots of sex and here's-what's-going-on-dialogue, not much story and certainly not like we got in the 1st 6 Anita books."
1,"I Can Handle Any Kink, It's Bad Writing That I Can't Stand","I usually measure the quality of the book by the amount of times I throw it across the yard. In the case of this train-wreck-of-a-book I threw it once every half page or so. The decline of the series is laughable. Had I wanted to read lots of sex this badly written I would have looked on the internet and saved myself the cost and hassle of reading Danse Macabre. The series has declined into nothing more than the author's feeble and laughable attempts to tell her critics, ""ZOMG! You're just jealous of Me!/Anita!"" (or, the equally sad, ""You're just frigid and don't like sex!""). Well-written sex can exist (and enhance) both plot and character development but this is a skill that the author lacks. Avoid this rancid little ""treat"" at all costs."
1,I'd give Ms. Hamilton negative numbers if I could...,"Why? Because she used to write edgy, scary mysteries with good plots, sexual tension, interesting characters and non-stop action. Now it's degenerated into a soft porn, angst-ridden soap opera!! I will vote with my money, just as I have with the last several novels she's written and leave this one on the shelf. Get a library copy if you must. There are just too many good authors out there to keep financially supporting one that continues to put out junk!"
1,does it have a plot?,"I have been reading the Anita Blake serries for years. I keep awaiting the next books, hoping that the next book will somehow magicly be better. This book was a complete disappointment. I don't mind maybe one or two sexual encounters in books, but for gods sakes hamilton you lost the plot! I officially will never read another Anita Blake book. This book should be moved to the erotic section and quit disgracing the genre of horror."
2,A Vampire Soap Opera,"This was my first Laurell K. Hamilton novel. I picked it up in a bookstore at the airport hoping that it was similar to my ultimate favorite paranormal books by Kelley Armstrong. What I found instead was that while Hamilton has a very imaginative sexual mind, I found most of the ideas rather disturbing (sex with a leopard, anyone?) and felt like I was reading a screen play for a bad vampire soap opera. Who suspected vampires and various were-animals were so dang emotionally delicate? Through all the psycho-babble dialouge I just never bought off on what Hamilton was trying to sell. Lots of pages dedicated to some very thoughtful sex scenes, but the entire story for me was anti-climactic. Too bad for me!"
2,WHAT HAPPENED LAURELL?!,"I know I must be crazy in saying this but this novel has too much sex!!! Now don't ge me wrong I like the sex scenes in her books but what happened to the plot?! Where is it? I loved when Anita would go on a case, deal with her boss, the chief and her beloved stuff penguin is gone!? Of course there was amazing sex scenes but not the entire book. I hate to say this but this is the worst Anita Blake book I read so far, I'm afraid to go on to the next novel."
2,Series getting worse,"I loved the beginning books in this series, but they are getting lamer and lamer the longer the series goes on. Nothing happens in this book, except a whole lot of sex and even more discussion about having sex. I like sex in my novels, but there should be more to it. How often and for how long do we have to deal with Anita having problems with the idea of having sex with yet another man? Get over it and get on with it. How many times and at what length does Richard have to agonize over being a monster? It's getting old.I thought the book was going to introduce a new twist with Anita being pregnant. It seemed like a development that had a lot of potential for bringing something new and interesting to the series, but guess what? She isn't really pregnant. Just has something weird, and impossible, going on.Either do something different with the series, or do something else."
2,Disappointed in Danse,"In the last book, ""Micah"", Hamilton returned to the format that made Anita Blake so enjoyable. Danse Macabre starts off great but quickly declines into one sex scene after another. So many original characters are absent it is like a different series."
2,Loss of a Heroine.,"I am coming to terms with the fact that the Anita I knew and loved is dead. (Especially after reading the author's response to the complaints on the series. She is taking the complaints as personal attacks and states that the objections just make her want to continue further into the direction that she is going. - Not very professional, but she is human and I feel for her.) I have to say that although I may read further Anita Blake books, I will not be purchasing them anymore. Instead I eagerly await the next Jim Butcher book - an author who shows how plot development should be done throughout a series. For anyone who loved Anita in the beginning of the series will love Harry Dresden and his adventures as a Wizard PI. (It has all the great cop drama, vampire action, and dark subplots that the old Anita embraced.) I mourn Anita, but am just happy that I have found the same pleasure I found early in the series within another talented writer."
2,What has happened to the series I got hooked on?,"I agree with most of the low rated reviews of this book. The sex stuff doesn't bother me like some people, but that seemed to be all there was to this book. Plus the whole book takes place in really a few days with mention that 2 weeks or so goes by in between one thing and another. The storyline did progress a little bit, but the series really hasn't been awesome in my opinion since Obsidian Butterfly. What has happened with Edward and his possible ""family""? The new characters seen in Danse Macabre are all and well and interesting, but there are still many loose ends in Anita's life and it seems that she is losing her active role as the Executioner. Overall I will still buy Anita Blake starring books, but in the case of this book, I wished I waited for the paperback or to borrow it from someone."
2,Remind me why I'm still buying these?,"I have loved this series since I started reading it 7 years ago, but it's taken a severe turn for the worst in the last couple years. I'm sick to death of the ardeur! Whatever happened to the original Anita who was smart, tough and a bit sarcastic? This one bores me to tears. I'm only about 1/3 of the way through the book, but I had to put it down. I will finish it eventually, but I had to take a break because there is NO PLOT beyond having Anita find new volunteers to feed the ardeur. Just when something starts to happen, the action is interrupted by another orgy scene.The negative reviews have nothing to do with people being averse to sex. It's that this series is nothing like it was meant to be. Someone mentioned Edward - one of the best characters in the series who should never have been married off. I think that was the ""shark jumping"" moment in the series. It has never recovered."
1,would be better with a real plot,"I agree with most of the other reviews - this series started out with good ideas and interesting mystery-type plots. It has dissolved into gratuitous sex and no mystery at all. Yes, yes, I know that the relationships are based on sex and power, but by now we all know that, so can't we move past it? If the Mother of all Darkness is going to make an appearance, let's get to it already. Let's have a plot with all this emotional/growth/sex baggage. All the 'development' can be interwoven with a real, honest-to-goodness story (preferably one that contains Edward). I will not purchase another LKH book until there is actual story to read."
1,So disappointed,"I used to love this series. I was really sad when it died... I used to wait on them to come out. I only read this book because I got it for free, and I don't think I'll read any further in the series."
1,What a let down,"I love the Anita Blake series - I've read it 3 times - and was so excited for Danse Macabre. What a disappointment! There was absolutely no action (not including the sex liberally sprinkled throughout). It was 400 + pages of her trying to figure out her new powers. The whole book was one big discussion. I kept waiting for the discussion to end so we could get to some kind of plot, but it never happened. They kept talking, arguing, having sex, talking, having sex, arguing....I actually had to put it down several times out of boredom. I'll keep reading because LKH has a good track record with these books so far, but I hope she cuts this crap out and gets back to the real Anita."
1,What happened to the old Anita Blake???,"I agree with the rest of the reviews. I've read this series since its' inception, and enjoyed almost all of the books. The sex has gotten stanger and more prevelant, but even through the last book it was still an adjunct to the plot. This one however has nothing BUT sex. No plot, no action. If you took out all pages which contain sex you wouldn't have 5% of the book left."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","I think this is really more 2 1/2 stars, but Amazon won't let me give it that so I went with 3. I liked the old Anita, but I also like the new, so I'm not one of those bashing the book because I'm not happy with the direction the author has taken her characters. I just wanted to see more originality, which is why I read LKH. This book had big sections that read very much like stuff in previous books (esp. with Richard). I almost felt like I'd read it already, there was that much repetition. Which explains why i didn't rate it higher."
1,Pity the trees that died for this book!,"No plot, no character development or growth, just nasty, lurid, yet strangely boring sex scene after sex scene. Anita does not go to work, does not raise any zombies, does not do any police work, pretty much doesn't do anything except have unprotected sex with 7 or 8 new guys despite having a pregnancy scare. Anita, get your tubes tied if you're that careless and really don't want a kid.Richard whines through the entire book, except when he's pretending to be a mature adult and trying to be supportive. (He's not, of course.) Micah, Jean-Claude, Damian, and a couple other men get walk-on bit parts so they can be used in some way by Anita. Nathanial is becoming more assertive and even less interesting, if that is possible. Vampires 2000 years old fall at Anita's feet for want of a good shag. Please!This series is dead."
2,Dead End,This will be the last Anita Blake book I will read. If you enjoy reading about LOTS of drama and LOTS of bad sex keep on reading by all means. I miss the kick-ass vampire killer and zombie raiser we all know and love. These books don't go anywhere anymore.
1,Not what they used to be,"I picked up this book hoping that it would make me excited about the Anita Blake books again. After reading it, I feel like I've wasted some time in my life.When I closed the book, I realized that I was still waiting for it to get better. I was still waiting for the plot. I was still waiting for Anita to act like Anita in other ways that didn't include her getting squeemish about all the sex that she has to have.This book is all vampire politics, new powers, and sex. There is no federal marshal, there is no take no prisioners Anita. I'm beginning to wonder if Anita ended a few books ago and we just didn't realize it."
1,I am done,"I hoped after the last few books that the books would return to mistery and police work. They have not. Only badly written porn left. No plot at all, I dont think that more than 15 pages are dedicated to the plotline. The book looks at roughly 24hours. Within these 24 hours Anita Blake is engaded at least 6-8 steaming sex or a erotic encounters with changing partners. Every sex scene goes over 20-30 pages (At least I had the impression they were s ooo long because they are repetetive and boring)Sorry Anita you are now a person you would have shot on sight in the first few books."
1,what happened?????,"This series used to be AMAZING!!! I even loved all the sex that everyone complained about all the way through Narcissus in Chains. Then it just got boring. No plot, the same sex scenes, too much emotional whining, and horrific editing. I'm done with Anita Blake."
1,Sadness,"I am very disappointed in the story line and the authors inability to see that while she can write what she wants, her readers can have their opinions as well. After all we're the ones wasting our money on what used to be a sure fire good read and has turned into something Penthouse might publish with a supernatural element. This will be the last of her books I'll purchase in this storyline until something improves. And I am very sad about this since I used to look forward to LKH books and recomend them to friends. Now I'm embarrased for her."
4,Kudo's for Danse Macabre,While I am somewhat dissapointed in the growing prevalence of sex in this series I am also able to understand this trend. Anita is dealing with her own growing sexuality and when you throw the arduer into the mix you get sex on a large scale. I am impressed with the character growth and development in this book. You are beginning to get more insights into the men in Anita's life. I did miss the inclusion of the detective side of Anita's life as well as her business. At the same time you can not expect to get to all aspects of her life in a book that only covers about 3 days of her life.
5,The beauty of the Beasts,"The only problem with this bookis that it could have had another hundred pages or so. The scenes immurse you with thier usual vividry and spontinaity. It all went by too fast for you to really sink your teeth into it until it was over. The finish was heart warming, but still left you a little confused. The story is expanding so well on Mother Darkness, but it could use a little more of a good side to her. Someone that makes the vampire council quake in thier boots can't be all bad. I liked the addition of Merlin, but I wanted to hear more about him. And most of all, Where is EDWARD!? There are so many new charachters that the books should be getting longer and longer. I for one wouldn't mind. A long book that keeps you interested and that slowed down a little bit would be nice, but I truly believe that Ms. Hamilton just keeps getting better and better. Read the book and decide for yourself, but I warn you, Your gonna love it."
3,Not for everyone,"I try to avoid trashing books because it was a good read. This book is not about Anita fighting evil or crime or detecting.This book is about politics. The politics between Master's of the City and the awakening of the first vampire:The mother of Darkness. If you understand that from the beginning and don't go in expecting the Anita Blake from books 1-6 you won't be disappointed. I don't really care about the sex, but sometimes it can get in the way of the story. I was disappointed that she left Wicked and Truth hanging for another story, but I was happy that Richard seems to be getting himself together."
4,"Not a lot of plot, but still a good read","This book is more about Anita Blake's relationships with the people in her life than about a plot. If you accept that, it's a good read. It answers some questions about her relationships, gives ever more insight into Anita's powers, and of course there's some sex. If you were disappointed with the shortness of Hamilton's last book Micah, you will not be disappointed with Danse Macabre. A quick read as always, it's a good summer/vacation book."
1,a major disappointment,"sex, sex, sex, and more sex..... this series is starting to go down hill....and this book is the worst......lots of writing with very little to say. No plot worth mention.....Richard character is annoying and irritating still....I don't see the connection b/w Jean-claude and Anita anymore; maybe b/c she has to juggle so many men. Bottom line: this book is a waste of time. Sorry Hamilton, but you can do better than this."
2,Such a disappointment...,"I was so disappointed in this book. It was just boring! The sex were blah and if I read ""bad animator, no cookie."" one more time I was going to scream. By the way, where was the animating part of this book? Has Anita just gone to have around the clock sex and quit her job that she has to do, or risk accidently raising the dead? I really hate that I bought this book in hard bound. What a waste of money. LKH, quit talking down to your fans that you are rapidly losing and just let this series end. I say, RIP Anita..."
2,Back to the Beginning,"After reading Hamilton's last three books, I went back to Guilty Pleasures. I had to go back to the beginning to understand what the heck I saw in LKH and why I was a fan. I remember why now, I hope the LKH will figure it out too."
1,It doesn't even deserve one star,"This book is the last straw. I'm not buying anymore of LKH's books. The sex scenes were boring, and they only occured after excessivly long angst sessions that totally destroyed any mood set. The climax was wrapped up so quickly at the end, it was as if she just got tired of writing and decided to end the book."
3,Bring back the real Anita Blake,"Oh what has Ms. Hamilton done with Anita? Where is the old adventure and nail biting situations. Now it is sex with anyone and anything and after a while, it becomes repetative and a bore. She belongs to Leopards, Vampires, Werewolves, Lions, etc. Enough already! The entire character of Anita Blake is gone and all that is left is an 'Ardeur' obsessed, bitchy woman.No time for work, since sex occupies the entire time."
1,Seriously??,"Wow... I was such an Anita Blake fan when this serious bagan...WAS a fan. I cannot even put into words how ridiculously horrible this books was. Basically this is hundreds of pages on who to have sex with to feed the aurduer. This issue has gone from ridiculous to pathetic. Ms. Hamilton has turned Anita into a whore, plain and simple and her feeble attempts to protest about taking yet ANOTHER lover is beyond annoying... I can honesly say that I will NEVER again read another Anita Blake book. I went from disappointed at the last four books to disgusted with this one. You can cross me off the fan list.I wouldn't even have given this book the one ""I hate it"" star if that were an option."
1,GAH!,"I am about half way through this book and I don't know if I'm going to finish it or not. All I can say is that I am really bored with it. Nothing is happening but talk and sex a lot of sex, boring sex at that. What happened LKH? Your books used to be fun, entertaining, and full of adventure with a plot now it only has a bed a big bed at that. I think the only thing that can save this series is that Anita dies during childbirth and 17 years later her child takes over and becomes a true ""Vampire Hunter"" instead of a ""Vampire Humper"". Thank god for real writers like Jim Butcher."
2,Enough sex already -- get on with the story!,"I loved the Anita Blake series when it first started out. But I have a sneaking suspicion that somewhere along the line Hamilton's publisher/editor has said something like, ""You know, Laurel, your stories are great, but you really gotta put more sex into them if you want them to sell..."" Danse Macabre is nothing more than a compilation of Anita's sexual logistics -- who, when, where and how to have sex, and let's just kick up the kinky scale a few more notches while we're at it. All of the fun characters and intriguing parts of her story line (Animators Inc., vampire executions and her federal marshall-hood) have fallen along the wayside as Anita is consumed with the task of feeding her ardeur and dealing with Richar's understandable jealousy.In a nutshell, if you've been buying this series for the kinky sex, you'll love this book. If you started reading it because of the vampires, lycanthropes and other supernatural ""stuff"", you'll be very disappointed."
1,Just not good,This book just wasn't good. At all. It seems to be lacking in an actual plot. There are way to many characters spinning around and I think that I've lost track of how many characters Anita has had sex with. There seemed to be many points that would've made good books on their own but were all crammed into this one. In short... this book just wasnt good.
2,What's happening?,"I've been avidly reading the Anita Blake series for about 4 years now, and all I can say is that the books have gone downhill. I recently finished Danse Macabre, and I was more disappointed than ever. In the majority of the books before this, there was something going on other than just Anita's life with her boyfriends (i.e. police work, zombie raisings, ect.), but I found the plot to hold very little in this part of the series. I felt that reading this book seemed more like a very small chapter in another, rather than the near 500 page book it is.In some of the older books(Killing Dance and Blue Moon), the sex scenes were a bit meaningful, and not so abundant. It feels now that in every chapter someone has to take their clothes off, or the word 'orgasm' has to be mentioned at least twice. I hope the next book in the series is a large step up than Danse Macabre, or I might lose hope in the series all together."
1,What happened to Anita Blake?,"The Anita Blake series has long been a favorite of mine. It saddens me that it has degenerated to the point where I no longer enjoy the books. Anita has changed and not for the better.I recommend Jim Butcher, Kim Harrison, Laura Anne Gilman, Carrie Vaugn, Rachel Caine and Patricia Briggs for better works of urban fantasy that Laurell K. Hamilton made so popular. Her successors are far exceeding her current efforts."
1,Just One Itty Bitty Problem,"There's only one really big problem with Danse Macabre. No, it's not the sex, although I imagine it's a contributing factor, and it's not the twisting of various personalities so that Anita is always cast in what I imagine is supposed to be the most sympathetic light. Nope, it's something much more simple.There's no plot. Not really. There are ghosts of plot bunnies, from Anita's possible pregnancy and the influx of Master vampires into the city to Anita's knack for picking up were packs without even trying, not to mention the Mother of All Darkness stopping by to remind us she's still out there, sorta, maybe, but not today. These could have been developed into something interesting, however they seem to do very little other than remind you that the Anita-verse didn't always look this way.Everything else is a wash of repetitive sex scenes and emotional angst that ceased to be interesting three books back."
3,Not my Anita,"I'm so disapointed in this book! I love sex just as much as any lustful American, but that was the whole story line in Danse Macabre. Plus, is it me or is Anita turning into a selfish witch?! I'm started to hate this heroine that I used to love. I think Laurell needs to take Anita back to her roots, working her job and raising zombies, not bedding every man she comes across. It is getting ridiculous. Enough of the ardure already, can we have some Vampire slayings and please kill off Micha and the stripper! BORING"
1,Incredibly Boring,"It happened so slowly that I don't know quite when it happened, but somewhere the Anita Blake books have just become plain boring. I had become disenchanted a few books ago, but held out hope the writing and plot line would get back to where it once has been. Danse Macabre is just boring -- there is no serious attempt at plot and the sex scenes are mechanical and totally lacking in any eroticism."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this book alot as I thought with the ardeur under control (Anita did go away for the weekend with just Micah and everything was OK) and her relationships had all been figured out (was even on friendly (and sex) terms with Richard) and with a couple of teasers out there about coming stories, the vampires Vittorio and Gwen and Mummy Dearest, so I thought that Dance Macabre would be great. Your've got the makings of a Big bad in there and in the end it was a weekend, that's pretty well how long the story lasted. You didn't really find out anything and there wasn't even a build up to a real comfrontation, all that happened over this weekend was that everything that had been fixed (ardeur, relationships & sex) was broken, so now its back to the waiting for the real story AGAIN.Plus, I like sex but I also want a story, after all Anita is a Federal Marshall and she is meant to be out there helping to catch the supernatural bad guys."
1,Waste of a perfectly good forest,"This book pretty much seals the fate of the series as far as I am concerned. It is nothing like the first 10 books; no plot, little character development and a lot of sex. Basically the whole book is a series of (1) Anita and others talk about having sex, (2) Anita has sex, and (3) Anita and others talk about why the sex occurred. Repeat until you are ready to throw up! The book brings nothing new to the series at all. I really have to wonder at the people who would murder a perfectly good forest to print this rubbish!"
1,I'm done with LKH,"Simply awful. I can't believe I've bought the last - - what - - 2, 3 LKH books. I don't care what's on her blog or what she says. The book had no plot and no end and I couldn't keep up with all the sex partners (and I love good sex scenes). Try ""The Vampire's Seduction"" by (psuedonym) Raven Hart. It was a cheap paperback that had some interesting new twists on vampires."
2,"I love erotica, but I need some plot movement as well.....","First, let me assure others that I love sex scenes - from romantic to erotic. I simply need some plot to hang it all on as well--- oh, yeah! And some character development would be nice too. This book is only slightly better than the last hardcover offering of Anita Blake. We simply have 450+ pages of Anita having sex to feed her magics. Sigh. It gets boring. The only really interesting sex scene is with Asher - but its too little too late. I've begun getting Ms. Hamilton's books via the library so I'm not out any $ while waiting for her to write a novel that moves forward the plot more than 1 day at a time. The ballet scene was well thought out and should have been more than an afterthought. The hints we get of big bad Mother Of All Darkness are great, but simply there to ensure the publisher keeps funding this tripe. For better reading try the Sookie Stackhouse series."
1,What Happened to Hamilton?,"I have been an avid fan and reader of Laurell K. Hamilton for 7yrs or so, and I hate to say this but Dance Macabre is a huge disapointment. Hamilton seems to have lost her flare for character development and plot driven stories. Though the sex scenes are steamy, they can no longer make-up for the lack of content. I would reccommend this book if you are looking for erotica because it doesn't have enough story to be anymore than that.Anita's possible pregnancy could have been a great exploration of Anita's character, but it was brushed aside much to soon.Hopefully Hamilton will come out with a story that can impact me as much as Obsidian Butterfly did."
2,At last! An Anita book unencumbered by plot,"This is the book all truly loyal Anita Blake fans have been waiting for! Where previous books wasted precious ink on plot, and other distractions, ""Danse Macabre"" bravely dispenses with unnecessary literary pretensions of this kind and gets right to the heart of what we really want, almost 500 pages of unerotic sex.At last! An Anita Blake book without gratuitous murder, police activities and suspense.Here's looking for more of the same."
2,An improvement BUT.....,"..it's still was not worth buying and I didn't (thumbs up). I felt it was better than Incubus because there was less sex scenes. But the book had me wishing for less arguing, power struggles, Anita worshipers and crying men. The story spans about 2 days and the issues never end. One dispute, problem or crisis after another. I don't know who should be more tired, the readers or Anita. She really should take a vacation!But there was some funny stuff! Richard's hissy fits were fun."
1,Told You So!,"Surely having a NEW Hamilton paperback selling for a mere $3.52 gave you a clue here. I said everything I needed to say about her in my review of MICAH. Notice on the tags -- ""bad porn"", ""bad erotica"", ""badly written porn"", and ""porn"". This is what Laurell K. Hamilton novels are about now.People! Pay attention! The great Anita Blake is dead. Hamilton killed her and is attempting to take her place in some kind of wierd goth fantasy. If you want some good Hamilton reading, start at LUNATIC CAFE and work your way up to OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY (I really miss Edward) then stop. Just stop."
1,Very Disappointing Read,"I have always enjoyed Laurell K Hamilton's stories, but this one was awful. I will hesitate to buy any Anita Blake stories in the future. For those of you who haven't read the book, let me summarize the entire story so you can save yourself some money. Anita has sex, debates who she'll have sex with, plans to have sex, and anguishes over abstaining from sex for five minutes. That's the entire book. When are we going to get back to Anita Blake actually doing something other than her boyfriends?"
1,The last chance,"This was the last chance for Anita and Laurell K. Hamilton for me. I miss the old Anita and the books that actually had a plot and characters I cared about. Actually for me the last chance came around chapter 20 when a third of the way into the book, the story hadn't progressed beyond the first day. It became clear that Anita was just going to have sex with numerous people and not engage me with an adventure of old. I returned it to the library - after the last bad book, I didn't even bother buying this new book. There was no story to get engaged with, no suspense and no new characters to like or even dislike - they all left me cold. I miss Dolph and Edward and Anita's other police friends. What about the characters from Animators Inc.? At this point in the series I don't see how Ms. Hamilton can get back to where we, the readers would like these books to be. I'll just hope that a new author will come along and fill the void that the new Anita Blake has left."
2,I'm getting the distinct impression that the sex is a filler for a very thin plot line,"This is my first review on Amazon, I felt compelled to write one in the hope that Hamilton will read this and ""regain her senses"". I refuse to buy any of Hamiltons books any more, the only reason I did this one is because I saw it on a library shelf..The series has become a sad thing to see, the last 4 books in this series have become filled with sex scenes that just don't add anything to the plot lines, just bulk to the book. I'm okay with detailed sex scenes, even enjoy them _as long as they contribute to the story development_ this doesn't..The author is obsessed with sex for sex's sake, much like a hollywood movie that is all special effects and no story. Hamilton has forgot that the story is all-important, which is a damn shame since there are so many threads that could be explored and turn this back into the truly excellent story that it started out to be."
1,Don't bother,"I got about halfway through this book and realized I didn't know why I was still reading this series. The plots have disappeared, the sex scenes are boring, and the characters are all so angst-ridden I can't bring myself to care anymore. That doesn't even count Anita. She's whiney, and constantly fighting about things that are stupid (while she and Jean-Claude are in the middle of diplomatic talks, no less), and she keeps picking up powers that are ridiculous. But they do cause her to have to have more sex, which has to be skipped in order to see if something interesting will happen.Sadly, it never does. It's sex, argue with Richard, sex, argue with someone else, sex, etc. I think all the intelligent people stopped reading when she picked up the arduer.Do yourself a favor: read Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Series or Carrie Vaughn's Kitty series instead."
3,dead slow but i love her,"yes die hard fan and most of then in hardback BUT a little less on sex scences and a hell of lot more action needed badly..... noboby but edwards is better at killing but anita is becoming wishie/washie, we love her cause she will be totally heartless to the bad guys or girls...what is/who is on her list is protected. And only god can care for people/monsters who piss her off..cause only he can talk to them.!!and yes laurell is setting up some good future scences with mother dearest.and yes still can't wait for next anita book in hard back-die hard-yes"
2,I agree with the reviews,"The sex in this book is ridiculous. I would have a hard time believing it if I was watching it as a cartoon. Besides that, the whole 400-page book moves at an unnaturally slow pace for no apparent reason. Around page three hundred twenty-fours hours actually pass. The characters remain distinct, with the exception of Anita who is being transformed into...I have no idea. Ninety percent of this book was badly masked porn with the remaining ten percent dedicated to plot. Also, the book ends oddly. It's like the author decided that Anita, as per some contract with her publisher, must have her life placed in serious jeopardy at least once. Voila! Ten pages before the book ends, she nearly dies. But just as neatly, she's fine. By far the worst book of the bunch."
