5,Rodriguez is an Excellent writer!,Richard Rodriguez has something to say to all of us. I loved Hunger of the Memeory and can't stop thinking about some of the ideas it's opened my mind to.
5,"Everyone with the surname Rodriguez, should read this book.","I read this book and it changed my life. I meet the author at a party and did not like him.But, I still loved his writing and how his work spoke to me."
2,Boring,"Andrew Amerson Engl 155 10/1/98Hunger of Memory, was not a very interesting book. It is not the kind of book that really catches my attention, although it is a good book. Rodriguez did a very good job describing his feelings on affirmative action and bilingual education with great detail. But I still don't see why he had to write a whole book on it. I wouldn't recommend anybody to read this book."
1,few redeeming qualities,"How strange - I read this book some years back and yet, coming across it again today all my old angry, negative impressions came rushing back. I too am Mexican, about the same age as the author, raised in California in a Spanish-speaking household by loving immigrant parents, Catholic grammar, high school and college-educated. Rodriguez and I shared many of the same experiences, positive and negative. In fact, up to a certain point his story could have been the story of my own life. But this book left me cold, worse than cold; it made me angry enough to literally throw it across the room, several times. I had to force myself to finish it. It's infuriating, and worse, tragic that this devious, cold-hearted, whiny, self-serving and self-centered author has become so influential. No tiene corazon."
4,Rodriguez presents to the reader the power of society,"Richard Rodriguez relates his own battle between assimilation and maintaing family tradition. He brings the reader to realize the power that society has, with it's ability to tear apart families and people. This struggle is presented with honesty in a well written book."
3,Slasher vs Superhero,"I spent a few years taking in every Chuck Norris flick that hit the theaters, and this was my first. Not a great film by any measure, but it satisfied in one particular: it had one of those Michael Myers clones infesting the B-movie scene in those days encounter, for once, someone who was just as tough and unstoppable. It didn't even matter that (spoiler alert!) the Myers clone survived, because he'd just have to deal with Norris again."
5,One of those films,This is just one of those films you must see if you are a action / horror film fan. A classic!
3,See Norris hit a guy in the round tables with a pool cue!,"John chops up some people (off screen) with an ax. Sheriff Dan Stevens (Chuck Norris) don't take kindly to that and smites him with some kicks to the face. John is taken to the hospital where some doctors secretly pump him full of a superhealing drug and it works. A little too well and John's back out on the street - in a snazzy Devo suit - killing people. Then he messes with Chuck's girlfriend and wins a one way ticket to pain.Mediocre Norris film, there should have been less talking and more fighting. Also when the motorcycle flew through the window and lands in the parking lot why did it sound like a trash can?"
1,"INTERESTING IDEA, BUT CHEAP PRODUCTION SINKS THIS CHUCK VS MYERS FLICK!","I saw this film many years ago and I thought it was a cool idea for a movie. Unfortunately, the film is hampered by low budget, bad acting, inane dialogue.....the list goes on and on. I'm not a big Chuck Norris fan, but this film which obviously borrowed some ideas from the film 'Halloween' has some small moments. It's pretty silly, but the killer is menacing and there are a few jolts here and there. I wouldn't buy it, but if you see it on cable..............you might get a few laughs. I rate it 1 1/2 stars."
3,Mediocre,I remembered watching this as a kid and enjoying it. After watching it again it's extremely dated. The actions good but the movie is just mediocre. Not bad but not very good.
5,Wow,"This movie creeped me out when I was younger. This is about a killer who can't die, the sheriff(Chuck Norris) trys to stop him.."
4,Not your typical Chuck Norris movie!,"A nice cross between a western, suspense and horror - definately check it out! I really enjoyed up and would recommend it to anyone."
2,Mainly for Norris fans,"Admittedly, I enjoy Chuck Norris movies. I enjoyed this one, but it isn't one of his better efforts. Norris is typically stoic to the point of being wooden, but the butt kicking scenes help redeem what might otherwise be a Grade Z movie. The scene involving bikers in a bar is particularly entertaining.It's a martial arts, scifi, horror movie spiced by some T & A. If that's your cup of tea, grab your popcorn, remote and have fun."
5,An AMAZING support during deployment!!!,"I received this book as a gift when my husband was recently deployed. I was left at home with a collicky 4 week old baby. Needless to say, I needed all the inspiration and support I could get. This book provided it! This book is very well written. Ellie Kay feels like a best friend holding your hand and helping you keep your chin up during the tough times. This book may not tell you the protocol of military life, but during a deployment, that is the last thing I was seeking. This book is a gem! It is the ideal read for someone going through the difficulty of seperation due to deployment. I thank God for Ellie Kay's words of comfort and wisdom!"
4,"Good, but not extremely informative.","This book was good and a fast read, however it was very biblically based and had many religious references. It didn't take away from the book, but is something for potential readers to be aware of. It is definitely a book to put your mind at ease if you're currently struggling with military life. It very much normalizes the thoughts and feelings military wives have, showing you you're not alone and can face what the military sends your way. If you're a new military wife looking for a lot information I'd recommend Today's Military Wife by Lydia Sloan Kline instead."
2,Not what I expected,This book did not keep my interest. I have read other books I borrowed from my local library that were more informative. I would not recommend this book to any military wife facing deployment of a loved one.
4,Wonderful Read,"I was watching the news one night and the author Ellie Kay was a guest...I was very interested in the book, so I was on here and reading other reviews when I started second guessing myself on this book or not, well I got it....and I couldn't put it down!! It is definatly more towards airforce and army than any other branch but it was still helpful. I've been a navy wife for almost 4 years now and I love it!! There was a lot of helpful hints on moves and how to deal with certain situations which was nice getting an outsiders point of view...anyway...would highly recommend this book!!!!!!"
5,"Helpful Information, wonderful book...","I found this book to be very helpful. Being a Airforce wife and my husbands first deployment of three months overseas, we found out three weeks before he had to leave. I definitly found this book resourceful during my time of need. I didn't have all the help that I needed and this book pointed out how I could get the help that I needed and then some. It does use alot of religion in it, but if you realize even for a non believer you still need to talk to someone even if your family and friends are not available, God is always available to listen. I also have a neighbor whos husband is leaving at the begining of the year for 1 year, she has also found this book to be helpful in preparing her for the departure. If I could I would give this book and Ellie Kay 10 stars just for writting it. Even if you are not a military wife or husband it is still very helpful. I would definitly recommend this book to anyone."
5,Prep for Life,"As a woman engaged to marry an Air Force fighter pilot, this book was extremely helpful. My fiance is amazed by how much I've learned and how smoothly my gradual transition into military life is going."
5,Just what I needed!,"This is just what I needed for my new walk-in bath tub. I'm supposed to sit on the seat, but then I have to wait forever for the tub to fill up to where I am comfortable. So instead, I sit on the floor of the tub where I don't use as much water and I'm warmer. But down there I couldn't reach the shower head. But, with my spray station, I can put my shower head where ever I need it. It's so easy to remove and restick that my husband changes it's location when he uses the tub and then I just switch it to where it's comfortable for me when I use the tub. It's the simple things in life that make me happy!"
4,Alcis works!,"I've been using Alcis for over a year ,and it works for me.I had torn rotator cuff surgery, and I've used this product to treat the pain and stiffness I still have. I rub it on twice aday and the relief last all day."
4,"Nice BP Meter, Software Need Work","The meter is very nice and seems reliable. The software is ok but lacks some features. There's no way to input readings taken manually using another meter. You can only import this unit's patient files. You can export to CSV, but you can't import a CSV. Installing on a Vista system was problematic."
2,Replacement blood preasure machine,"Not satified with new model, I fell older model was more responsive,had better features, simpler to store cuff. Only replaced it because of usb connection broke internally (same type on newer model)"
1,Software Compatibality,The software for this device is not compatible with any version of Windows Vista and I have been unable to find any updated drivers for it.
3,"Decent device, terrible software.",I really like this device. The integration with HealthVault is great but the software is very buggy and difficult to use.
1,Defective product,"I bought one of these from Costco. The USB cable would not fit into the device. I called the help line. They immediately acknowledged that I had probably received a unit with the wrong cable and sent me a new one. A computer technician looked into the jack on the device, told me that the guts of the jack were completely missing and that there could be no cable that would fit -- that I had bought a defective machine. I bought a second machine and the cable would not fit in either the old or the new one. These were made in China. Microlife probably knows all about this defect and allows them to be sold anyway. A Cheat. Karl Loren"
3,Good machine - UBS connector to PC is very poor design,"This is a very good blood pressure machine if you intend to use as a standalone device. The USB cord that comes with the kit allowing you to connect to your home PC is junk. The USB connector for the PC side is a standard USB connector which works fine - the connector to the blood pressure machine is the most fragile connector I have ever seen on consumer electronics. I had to use a 15 power magn glass to see the 4 tiny, tiny pin connectors that you have to plug into in order for it to work with the computer. I'm a computer guy - so connectors are all in a days work - this one would be hard to hook up in a lab with good eyes - I can't think of my mom trying to plug it in at 70 years old.Avoid if you are buying to use with a PC until they fix the connector to a standard plug that anyone can push in. I took my back to Costco."
3,Great BP Monitor BUT...........,"Takes very accurate readings if you follow the instructions. However, I bought this particular model for it's compatibility with my PC. Never got to use it because the cheap plug that connects the Monitor to the PC was inoperative out of the box...They need to get a fix for that 2 cent plug ASAP!!!"
5,Microlife Blood Pressure Monitor with Download software,"This is a great blood pressure monitor. I was disapointed it didn't come with an AC adapter, it had to be ordered separately."
4,Jones Steps Up To The Plate,"I will be honest from the get go and tell you that I am a huge Dipset fan, but that bias aside, I definitely think this is one of the best rap cd's of 2006. Jones gives a suprisingly mature effort on P.O.M.E., and touches on many subjects he has never covered on previous songs. Highlights include the intensely paranoid cut ""Emotionless"" where both Jones and Santana spit memorable verses. Other standout tracks are ""Reppin Time"", ""Bright Lights, Big City"", ""So Harlem"", ""Weatherman"", ""Pour Wax"", and of course the smash hit ""We Fly High"" (BALLLIN!!). Overall, Jones has created a very strong and solid effort, which he should be extremely proud of."
1,LOOK AT THE ALBUM COVER...........,A New Transvestite rapper has come... Even Chingy is laughing at this bozo.. WTF is he wearing a medium size t-shirt and girls pants??.. Looking at this album cover tells you how this album is gonna be like and of course its from these Dipset fagz... nuff saidP.S. I heard half of this album........ CERTIFIED TRASH & Gay
3,Well..I bought it...,"I bought the album, and well, it's OK. Not bad, not great, but OK. We fly High is one of the highlights here. There are some cuts on the CD, so the verdict is Mid-grade effort for Jimmy and the Dipset. I think Jimmy is a good producer, and very good at promoting. As an artist, well he even says he is not a rapper. Buy this CD if and only if you get it at discount, or a free CD like I did. If not, download the hot cuts. I would not recommend paying a premium price for this CD."
5,Best Jim Jones cd,"the beats be on point production good his lyrics be alright some funny ad libs max b singin on there made the tracks even better best tracks are we fly high, reppin time, love of my life, my life, emotionless, so harlem, i know, pour wax, dont forget about me, the intro matter of fact the whole cd he make that ryder music you can listen to the whole cd all the way threw. Good guest apperances specially juelz max b wayne. u need to get 2 of these just in case"
1,JENNY JONES,"THIS ALBUM WASN'T GOOD AT ALL! SAME OL TIRED SONGS THREW THE WHOLE ALBUM! I REALLY HOPE 2007 WILL BE THE YEAR OF REAL HIP HOP! NOT FAKE MADE UP BEEFS AND PUBLICITY STUNTS! DIPSETS REALLY DON'T BELONG IN HIP HOP, THEY BELONG ON DAYTIME SOAPS!"
2,Polluting Or Murdering Ears (P.O.M.E.),"Whats the obvious fact that most of us can agree on? Jim Jones cant rap plus he sounds like he is doing his worst Scarface impression. Sure songs like So Harlem, Bright Lights, Reppin Time, Pin The Tail, Get It Poppin(Jha Jha SUCKS), We Fly High and Weatherman(Lil Wayne's verse was alright) have great production, but Jim Jones's lyrics leave something to be desired. Plus whats with all the joints featuring Max B on the hook? Max B is on EVERY OTHER SONG! Dude sounds like he swallowed a rooster. If the first two albums from Jim Jones were bad then this one being bad should be of no surprise. One last note: what is Jigga thinking paying this much attention to Jim Jones? Is he trying to give Jim Jones' career an unwarranted boost? Nobodies in the rap game starting beef with giants is a gimmick that 50 cent used until he was rich! If Jay-z is not going to use his brains then maybe he needs to retire."
1,Anyone giving this album more than 3 stars is...,either1. Has NO IDEA about REAL hip-hop2. Is a Dipset teenybopping fagget3. A kid in this new generation that is caught up in bad music4. Just a plain retard that likes bad musicThis album is garbage. All the beats sound like beats Cam'ron didnt want and threw away. He can't rap - no flow whatsoever.Hes not a real hip-hop artist. Hes not even a real rapper. Dude cant hold an album done mostly by himself so he has Max B or someone else on every song but 2 lmao wtfStop supporting this trash and listen to some real rap aka Nas (Hip-Hop Is Dead...and this album is proving that saying)
2,Everything sounds the same...,"Why does he have to say Ballin' every song? I thought it was catchy on We Fly High. I love that song, and that's why I copped the album. But honestly, all the songs are too similar. Plus he loses credibility for runnin' with that fool pink-panther looking Cam'ron."
1,Crude anti-semitic nonsense.,"Well that's about it really. The book, I browsed it as a ebook, is rubbish. It's so full of inaccuracies about Judaism and Israel that I doubt the author, if there really was one, is Jewish or has ever visited the country.Strictly propaganda for the right wing loonies."
2,Waste of paper,"Making meaningful sense out of the content of this book is impossibily hard. It's like a lot of info in a garbage can. Authors did not even try to sort it or clarify things. I borrowed BCRN book from a friend. Easy to read, eveything is in place. It looks like Sybex's only successfull CISCO book is CCNA course."
2,Don't buy this book,"I recently bought this book believing several recent 5 STAR reviews. I thought these were reviews from recent test takers. I just completed chapter 5 and so far have found this book to be very confusing with lot of errors. This book appear to be written by people who lack the technical depth in Remote Access. Anytime the book tries to explain technical details such as call setup procedure, it gets very confusing. I have had to refer to CCO publications to understand majority of technical explanations so far. I recommend a differnt book."
1,A very shallow attempt !! Do not waste your time on this one,For those who wish to 'pass' an exam I guess this serves the purpose. For those who wish to 'understand' and 'deploy' technology - this book is terrible !! The authors have treated major subject areas like Frame Relay and ISDN with such callousness ... its really frustrating !! Do not stop to pick this one up - its not worthy of a place on your shelf !! - Lamelle has done better in his earlier CCNA books - this was a royal let-down !!
2,Barely adequate,"After buying the Support and Switching books from Sybex, I was disappointed in their Remote Access book. It is not up to the same quality. The Authors have a tendency to repeat themselves from one sentence to the next. I found at least a dozen mistakes in both the text and the end-of-chapter quizzes. I did pass the Remote Access exam by using this book and on-the-job training. I can't believe anyone could pass the test by using this book alone. I have not read any other of the CCNP Remote Access books, but I would think there is something better available. I don't even recommend it as a reference book. There is just not enough detail nor is it clearly explained."
3,Using this book I passed the BCRAN but...........,"........... there are too many omissions & mistakes in the book to be a top-notch study guide.I passed the BCRAN with a 853/1000 (706: pass mark) in December of 2000 using this book as the study guide and Boson's practice tests.However, there were questions in the exam that weren't even covered in this book. An example would be chat-scripts or certain dialer commands.Plus there were too many syntactical mistakes in the book which got bloody annoying after a while! An example of this would be where they would display the dialer string command sometimes as 'dialer-string' and other times as 'dialer string'. To truly teach a subject (especially one where an incorrect command could cause you to fail the cert exam) you need to have the basics correct. To do so otherwise is inept.I will not be buying any more of Lammle's Cisco books. I'll be sticking with the CiscoPress series of books which I've found to be excellent."
3,3/4 CCNP,"Todd Lammle's books have helped me pass my MCSE and my CCNA. I always buy his books, because I trust the scope and depth of the material. This book does not meet my expectations. It lacks the details needed to pass the Remote Access test. If I had to pass the BCRAN again, I would have chosen one of the Cisco Press Books."
3,Author&#65533;s references are weak.,"Author's references are weak. As I was reading through this book, I found an error regarding a service provider's limitation on one of it's Frame Relay Platforms. I sent an email to Sybex about this incorrect information. Robert Padjen , co-author, sent me an email stating the information was correct based on his latest information six months ago. I replied to his email and informed him that his resource had given him incorrect information. As of this date, I still have not received a follow-up from my last email."
1,Total failure!,"If compared to 3 other Remote Access books, this one is a total failure! For my exam preparation I used all 4 books: BCRN (McGraw Hill), CiscoPress book, Remote Access by R.Rossi and this Sybex's ""masterpiece"". To my opinion the best is BCRN. CiscoPress is more like a very good manual. And if you want to polish your remote access knowledge - use Rossi's book. But if you want to spend your time filtering info, trying to define, what is useful (like 3 pages of Cisco700 router commands!- who needs to memorize it),filling termilogy gaps and translating in plain English authors attempts to explain some remote access subjects - go with Sybex's newest ""masterpiece""."
1,This book is a mess,"I picked the book, looking at the 5 star rating in Amazon.com. What a mess! Absolutely unreadable, authors use terminology without explaining, what terms or CISCO commands mean. Look at page 219, for example. What is a Channel type, Linecode, Time slot? And it is like this througout the book! Welcome to Sybex's amateur writers club. I exchanged it to Building Cisco Remote Access Networks from Ciscopress ISBN1578700914. This is a beauty! Very solidly written. Has continuous explanation of everything you need for real life and passing paper test. Strongly recommend."
3,Could be better,"You can evaluate smth only comparing it to smth else. In this case CiscoPress book has much better layout and visualization of the subject. If I give 4 stars to Cisco book, then this one I can give only 3 stars."
1,"An Error Filled, Poorly Written, Inaccurate Mess","This book stinks. I know that's not high-flown prose, but the book is terrible. Filled with inaccuracies, typos, confusing text and undefined terms, this book has proven to be as much of a stumbling block as it has a study aid. To be honest, I and the five colleagues I am studying with have found so many mistakes that we no longer have any confidence or trust in the accuracy of this book for test preparation. I'll be driving over to the bookstore this afternoon to pick up the Cisco version, simply to use as a cross-reference and fact-checker. I'm considering abandoning the Lammle book altogether. Buy and use at your own risk."
1,Not a Lammle book,"Every book I own related to Cisco is by Mr. Lammle. But this is one so confusing and not a Lammle quality. Many examples are from ""show config"" or in debug mode that only a very experient Cisco person could figure out. This may be a good reference book but not a good studing guide. I hope Mr. Lammle would review any book that bear his name more thoroughly before releasing it."
4,Learned a lot,"This book is great! While limited by the motorbook format, the lavish photos and sidebars put a lot of info in your hands for such a small book. I was particularly impressed by the chapter on the U.S. Military Sealift Command, as the material there seems well-researched and the photos are of ships of the same class as those I've seen call at Guantanamo Bay since I've been here. The role shipping plays in the world economy is discussed as well as changes in the way shipping is flagged and other issues. By no means the last word on the subject this is still an excellent source if you want to know how modern cargo ships work."
4,Classical Fighting Arts of Japan,"Koryu Jujutsu is one of the original fighting styles of Japan this books gives you a good overall summary of this martial art,(Koryu Jujutsu).This book also tells you about one of the most popular martial arts today that was based on a part of Koryu Jujutsu , Judo.This is one of my favorite martial arts based book.This book is very good for beginners and advanced martial artists I recomend it for anyone who is big into martial arts."
1,Not Very Good,"To be honest, I bought this book in the United States when it first came out. I read it and my reaction was less than stellar. If I had not been exposed to other far better writings offered up by say, Koryu Books (ie Koryu Bujutsu) I would have thought it was great and would have been satisfied with my purchase and choice of reading material. However, anyone buying this book with serious intentions to study koryu is better off not wasting money.On the plus side, there are nice pictures and at least it's in English!"
4,A great debut from a very talented artist,"This stuff is very good. You can feel the sincerety in the album. Every piece right from the rock ballads to the fast paced tracks stand out beautifully. This is an album that people will look back upon in time gone by as proof that good music, without any comparision, is like good wine and will only get better as the years go by."
4,Twenty-two years on - still sounds great,"I had a lot of respect for Richard Marx when this album was first released, but after reading more about his career a bit more in-depth recently, I have MUCH more respect for him. He worked very hard to even get a demo heard and he had a storied career before recording it - singing backup for lots of then-popular singers and writing great pop tunes.I enjoy the majority of this album (there are a few pieces of cheese in here) all these years later and was glad to put a copy of it back into my collection as an actual album (good ol' vinyl). I enjoy Marx's songwriting ability and his voice is very soothing, very romantic.He deserves all the good fortune he's had in the music business. - Donna Di Giacomo"
3,Nice Hit Producing Debut Album,"Richard Marx's self-titled debut in 1987 was sensational indeed. He kept on making hits starting from Don't Mean Nothing, Endless Summer Nights, Should've Known Better, and Hold On To The Night which became his first #1. But when I heard his album at that time I didn't think that he continue to get on the hit road for another 5 or 6 years. As an album as a whole some of the song is catchy and excellent as the all first five tracks of the album but after Have Mercy only memorable track is Heaven Only Knows. It is a good album but most of my favorite tracks became already hits and you can listen to them by Greatest Hits. Lonely Heart is excellent though. Recommendable for 80s rock fans, who want to know him more other than Greatest Hits."
5,Awesome!,His very first CD still rocks. Heaven Only Knows is wonderful song great lyrics and melody. Richard Marx is a genious. Get his new CD Stories To Tell you will not be disappointed
3,good start,"a very good start for Marx who worked here with big producer David Cole, first track is a gem, the rest is ok but nothing special."
3,Actually..3 1/2 stars.......,"""The Cad"" began wonderfully..I love a book where we dont have to wait long for the H/H to meet...I really was into this at first and was so excited because I thought that I had found a keeper...well, imagine my disappointment then when this story fell flat on it's face a little more than half way through...There was a huge separation between the H/H that had me desperately skimming ahead to see when they would finally be together again..also, there were many secondary characters in this book that instead of making things more interesting just annoyed me...""The Cad"" wasnt awful...but it was definitely not more than mediocre at best."
4,Great book!!,A really great read! Plenty of drama to keep the story interesting. Very well paced and nice narrative. A really sweet story at points and at other parts gut wrenching. Can't wait for more of the series!
3,OK but not a keeper!,"The storyline is nice, with an original telling of a somewhat common theme. The Cad could have been a great novel. Unfortunately, it's not! The characters are lacking depth. Ewen has asked Bridget to be his mistress. She has a scar and consequently, lowered self-esteem. Bridget refuses his offer and Ewen goes the next step, asking for her hand. They marry. Some in the ton don't believe it nor understand it, and gossip prevails.I gave the novel 3 stars as Amazon doesn't give option of 2 1/2. Fine to read, but not a keeper."
2,Disappointing,"Edith Layton is one of my favorite Regency authors, unfortunately this is not one of her better novels. The main characters were uninteresting and the plot was absurd. By the end of the book I simply could have cared less. I am giving this book two stars only because Layton is stylistically a very good writer. The story on its own merits 0 to 1 star. If you want to read some excellent Regencies by this author I highly recommend the Signet Regencies and Super Regencies published in the late 80's and early 90's. Her early novellas in the Signet anthologies are also excellent!!"
3,not a kid just want to be anonymous,"if you want to hear some decent party rap, then go with this cd. all rap is pretty much the same as far as lyrics go, but this has a decent beat to it. i dont discriminate on rap, i like all kinds of other music, and this is some good rap. f*ck the other people that say this is bad because the lyrics suck. rap isnt about the lyrics they are all the f*cking same. it's about havin a good beat that makes you wanna party"
1,A DISASTER,"In all honesty UNk is a disaster to the Hip Hop culture. I cannot understand how anyone in their right mind can label this as hip-hop/rap! The lyrics are totally senseless and the beats suck. Making a song about a dance that has been out for a long time (and yes everyone was dancing like that back in their junior high days) is not called music. I would never buy this album, more less download the ""songs"". The only good southern rapper is Luda, and T.I isn't that bad. So far UNK has done nothing to amaze me and I'm pretty sure that he never will... HE JUST SUCKS!!!![This gets no stars from me]"
5,CD,"My son Loves this CD. Although the lyrics seems to be ""basic"", the most favorite song on this CD is Walk it out."
1,More garbage from the south.,"""Walk it out"" is up there with other terrible tracks such as ""laffy taffy"" and ""lean wit it rock wit it"". Music like this makes me want to hug my real hip hop CDs from Nas, Jay-Z, Biggie, Pac, and Wu Tang. This is a joke. Some southern music has a nice beat to it, but just has mediocre lyrics. This, is awful. The lyrics make me want to pull my hair out, and the beat it just decent. This is another no-talent loser trying to make a quick buck. Please, for the love of Hip Hop, DO NOT BUY THIS CD. Go pick up the new Nas CD, or the new Ludacris cd. Luda remains to be the only superb rapper from the south. TI is in second. Everyone else is a disgrace to this country. If we dont kill the ""crunk"", then ""Hip Hop is Dead""."
1,GARBAGE,"his dude is soooooo wack the only reson you even get a star is because of the beats thats it,lyrics are wackayo go check outJay-ZNasAZRakimLupe FiascoTHATS HIP HOP"
3,i don't know about this one!,Just an average ATL style album.....what happened to this dude....he disappeared
4,Good not great,"Sound quality is a bit better than the '93 remaster and the DCC Gold. A bit more punch and crispness. There are bonus tracks, though the quality of them is so-so. Studio tracks/demos not great but the live tracks are OK (if not period). Should be something better to put on here-what about the Unplugged tracks from this album? Packaging is very similar to Band on the Run from last year. Triple opening, booklet on left and 2 discs top loading on the right. Almost as thick as the BOTR deluxe 3 disc edition."
4,Well...,"This review is for the new edition of this release. The original album I give 5 stars. But this version was a little disapointing to me. The sound is better, but not that much better. And the second disk is really kind of a waste. It really only has one extra song, which is the full version of one of the short tracks on the original. The other material is live material from much later (huh?)Well its very nice, the the original was fine with me!"
3,Album of great demo's,"He still sounds like a Beatle on this one.Same as George and John on their first.After that mediocrity.They all sound like really good demo's.Some would have been trashed.Others mighthave made it on a Beatle Album,with alittle help from his friends.No one wants to tell the emperor he hasno clothes.Sorry!I love him to bits.But, the best thingshe did were with John,George and Ringo."
3,The Archive its OPEN with some surprises but not much on this....,"McCartney it's simply my rock star leyend model, i grew up listening to the beatles music thanks to my brother who is only 4 years older than me!!, I enjoy each and every album made by MACCA, some better than others, and although i have almost all, when i knew that he will launch a campain to remaster every album in such a beautiful editions i just thought ""hope i could have the money to buy them!!"" this is the second i bought and its like i heard it for the first time, sadely i haven't found a lot of new things here neather in the music or the graphic and photographs inside the book, of course it was the first album for MACCA as a solo artist, so i wasn't expecting to much from this... i pray that the news issues (i'm already waiting for my McCartney II remaster) have a lot more to give us in music and graphic...if you are a truly MACCA fan like me you can't wait to put your hands on this ARCHIVE COLLETION"
2,I'm just lamenting.....,"I haven't heard the remastered version, but the version I have on CD, released on Capitol-EMI, is so bad, so poorly produced, so poorly panned hard left and hard right, and so difficult to listen to. No complaints about the songs - I love Paul for stepping out as big as he did on this record. BUT - it was fine when I had the LP and a crappy set of stereo speakers, but, let's face it - this album was BADLY recorded and I'm not too sure any amount of remastering will do any good. The WHOLE THING NEEDS TO BE REMIXED! Then, remastered! Then re-released."
1,You must be joking.,"McCartney was AT BEST a mediocre album with one or two good songs on it. McCartney needed John Lennon and George Martin. On his own, his work is mostly mediocre. Fragments and bits and pieces of good things - but lacking across the board. Sixty plus bucks for a Special Edition of this record is stupid...obscene. Even if you like the record (and I do, sort of) it's almost all filler. Pleasant, forgettable, humdrum.McCartney II is far worse - somebody wrote along the way that it ""shipped gold and was returned platinum."" The low point of a lot of self-indulgent McCartney crap."
3,Paul McCartney on his own,"Newly married and dizzy with domestic bliss, Paul stated that the theme of his first solo release would be ""home, family, love"". It is. It's also raw and unfinished, with three instrumentals (on one album?) and some of the songs are fragmented. Recorded at home by himself (it also included a self serving interview with himself, basically stating that the Beatles were dead) all is not lost here. ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" is a standout; curiously it wasn't released as a single until 1977, when Wings put out the live version. ""Every Night"" is a pleasant charmer, as are ""Junk"" and ""Teddy Boy"", which are both leftovers from the Beatles' ""White Album"" sessions. I do enjoy this album, but I think that it falls far short of Paul's potential."
2,Disappointing affair...,"As a devote Beatle fan I've began to expand my collection into the solo works of the Beatles. This album was a complete disappointment. I've listened to this album intently for the fifth time hoping it would grow on me to no avail. Do yourself a favor and skip this album entirely, it comes across as an album of 'B' sides and outakes that are poor at best. If your looking to expand your Beatle horizons start with anything from George or John."
1,Not much to recommend here,"This sounds like it was recorded by a self-indulgent musician in his basement... oh, it was. Apart from the superb ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", which is still a staple of McCartney's thrilling concerts, and ""That Would Be Something"", there is nothing here of substance or interest."
4,"Wow, It keeps getting better.","I first picked this LP up back in 81 just after McCartney II came out and Columbia records reissued it on LP. I was not very impressed. I listed to it every now and then and found myself starting to like some of songs that at first I considered boring. I just replaced the Columbia LP due to the demise of my record player with the EMI CD and listened to it for the first time in years. Wow, what a great record, very personal, raw, and telling of the current state of mind that Paul was in. Perhaps John and George started their Post Beatle career with better releases, but any fan of the Beatles will see the quality of the songs and understand it in the context it should be taken in. Paul doing it all with some vocal help from Linda, having fun, and releasing a few songs that to this day hold up as well as any Beatle tunes."
4,Homegrown,"When McCartney appeared in May 1970 it was roundly savaged for not being Son Of Abbey Road. Two decades later we can accept it for what it is: a low-key, homemade album of considerable charm. Paul plays pretty much all the instruments, with the accent being on acoustic guitars, and there's a kind of folkish air about it that's immediately appealing. If I have a criticism, it's that there's not a lot of truly great *songs* here (exception: the five-star classic Maybe I'm Amazed). Then again, maybe that's not the point. Like Dylan's Nashville Skyline or The Kinks' Village Green, it's the *mood* of the album that casts a magic spell over you, rather than any individual track. Terribly underrated. Several of the songs -- Teddy Boy, Every Night, Junk -- began life as Beatles cast-offs, and one -- Hot As Sun -- dates back to the early days of the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team. Fittingly enough, Paul included a fair whack of this album in his 1991 Unplugged set."
3,Post Beatle,"""Maybe I'm Amazed"", ""That Would Be Something"" and ""Every Night"" validate the cost of the CD alone. However, for those who have an interest in the growth and maturing of an iconic musician McCartney is a must have. The rawness of the production and individuality of this one man show (with the exception of Linda's vocals) perhaps was what Paul needed to continue musically post-Beatles.For you younger listeners, with no interest in the growth of Paul's talent, get the three tracks at the very least."
4,Good music from a good artist,Very enjoyable with quite a few good live and demo versions of songs. Good work and a good version for a good price.
5,McCartney ( Ardhive Collection),Paul never ceases to amaze me! Listening to this took me back in time to my other Hippie Self. The only thing better is seeing the great McCartney live!!!!
3,"Of historical interest, but otherwise disappointing","There are several good songs, including the original studio version of ""Maybe I'm Amazed,"" but a lot of it sounds like he made it up as he went along. I'd say it was of historical interest, being his first solo album, but otherwise a bit of a disappointment."
1,He is no John Lennon,This album is nothing but cute little songs about puppy dogs and ice cream. If you like songs with no depth and meaning this album is for you
2,Undeserving of praise!,"This labum does have it's moments...like the afore mentioned ""Maybe I'm amazed"" and even ""Hot As Sun Glasses""....however, I must agree, despite some raw ingenuity which McCartney has since for the worse abandoned, the album needed editing...I think instead of rush releasing this project, he could have culled more materiel and made a stronger album...if you have Ram, think of an album with the strongest tracks from each...I personally think that for every 3 albums Paul has put out, he should have put out one...."
4,Pleasant,"McCartney's first solo album (released before Let It Be) was as simple as a Beatle can get. This could be seen as clumsy or unfinished, but I think that Paul wanted the album to sound this way purposely. Almost like a vacation from perfection, Paul sings songs of love and happiness using the elemental rock instruments without using many studio effects.Some songs are slightly annoying and repetitive, but overall this recording leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. Songs like ""Every Night"" and ""Momma Miss America"" are great fun while ""Junk"" and ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" stand out as some of Sir Paul's greatest melodies of his career. A must have for true Beatles fans (especially those who are fond of Paul).However, of the 3 post-Beatles albums released in 1970: this, Plastic Ono Band, and All Things Must Pass.... The latter is the only one to come close to the magic that the fab four once had."
4,Fun Songs,"""Maybe I'm Amazed,"" although commercial, is still a heart tugger. The rest of these *silly little love songs* are fun, lighthearted tunes.Great, smooth McCartney vocals. Linda does not play, although she is obviously very important in the scheme of the album.Written mainly under the ravages of the Beatles decline, this album does not seem quite full. Though, it has some charm due to its artsy, borderline weirdness and quaint sensitivities."
3,Doodles,"I wish McCartney had spent the time to actually finish some of these tracks, or jettison them for real songs; too many of them are little more than musical doodles that go nowhere. The album does contain the excellent ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", ""Teddy Boy"", and ""Junk"", but these and the handful of other songs that bear repeat listening would only 1/4 of a CD (or 1/2 of an LP, for those of you who bought it on vinyl the first time 30+ years ago)."
2,bonus material?,I had forgotten that this was mostly him playing with the tape recorder in the studio. About a third of the songsare worth listening to. Did have a good live version of maybe I'm amazed.
3,good album. not so great reissue!,"I've been waiting for the reissue of this album for some time. I actually have the vinyl of this album. I always liked this album. I was disappointed that they put this out as a two cd set when there is only enough material for one cd. This is just a way for them to charge more money. I think the two CD's together add up to less than 60 minutes. Like I said this is a good album, but quit ripping off the listeners!"
2,Not exactly Vintage,"This is a fairly mediocre album. For Paul's first solo effort, you would have expected something closer to the inspiring work on Abbey Road or Let it Be. Instead it sounds rushed and underproduced. There are a few classic songs (""Maybe I'm Amazed,"" ""That Would be Something"") but generally, it reveals his weakenesses as a solo artist. His biggest weaknesses are his insistence on playing nearly every instrument by himself, and his tendency towards lyrical superficiality. I love Paul McCartney, but this is a haphazard effort."
3,made of plastic,These rings have worked fine but I was disappointed to see they are made of hollow plastic. That being said I weigh 220 pounds and I have been using them for two weeks now without breaking them.
1,Mistaken Identity,"You have to look really hard to figure out this is a kids set of Rings. I bought these thinking what a great price they were for rings only to find out that these ""Iron Man"" rings are in fact toys."
3,It's okay,"It's got some cute ideas, but I was hoping it would be better than it was. I'll keep it anyway, though."
5,Soulful and Wonderful!,"This is a beautiful album full of chanting, drumming, and haunting melodies. It incorporates unusual Jewish music from around the world. I highly recommend it."
2,Tuning the soul,"I just have one word for this one, BORING. Nothing too 'soul tuning' if you ask me. I would not purchase this again. I could get more 'soul tuning' by listening to Fiddler on the Roof!"
5,For those who love ribbon embroidery!,"This book, is truly for those who love to make ribbon flowers.It is also for those who want to learn to make silk ribbon flowers. The instructions are well illustrated, and easy to follow. A wide range of flowers are included such as the pansy, violet, hollyhocks and a range of roses. The projects are inspirational and not too difficult. I love this book and have used it many times to make gifts for friends and me.I would have no hesitation to recommend this to anyone who wants to create their own little piece of beauty."
3,"So-So Swiss Army Knife Pouch, Sheath from Victorinox","I bought the same pouch and medium ones from the vendor's web site. The box said Victorinox, but the pouch label and quality said Made in China. The large pouch will just hold the Champ plus. One of the pouches had trouble staying closed with a knife in it. There is nothing special about either the material, workmanship or design. If you can live without the barely visible Victorinox cross on the flap, you can find better, more attractive choices in a knife sheath from other manufacturers."
2,"Bad overall quality, but it works.","Let me just start out by saying that Victorinox is a great company that makes fantastic knives...sheaths on the other hand are not their strong suit. The sheath was barely as described, and I could barely fit my swisschamp plus into it. It's supposed to be a ""large"" sheath, but was actually fairly small. Another thing to mention is that the material used wasn't too great, but at least it works for now. If you can stand not buying a Victorinox sheath, then don't do it. At least by another type of sheath from Victorinox because this one isn't worth your time."
4,Good,"My ""Victorinox Swiss Army Champion Plus Pocket Knife"" fits PERFECT!Made for each other, great construction materials.The only thing i didn't like is that you can't really see in the pictures that the sides of the pouch isn't made of leather as you'll expect, it's made of some spandex like material, it takes some of the stylish away, anyway pretty cool."
5,xmas gift,My husband loved it! I bought him the Victorinox Swiss Champ Sapphire for his birthday as a replacement for another swiss army knife he misplaced. He stated to me he had lost it because he did not have a case for it knowing this I got him this case for the new knife. Nice and simple just the way he wanted it to be.
4,Good product but...,"I would have preferred the pouch had Velcro, I had one with it many years ago and I thought would be the same."
2,No good info on the knife sizes that could fit in this pouch,"I took a chance buying this item thinking it would fit fine in my Swiss Army knife, even though there was no good info on the pouch size. So I was disappointed when I had to put on a serious effort to fit my ""oversized"" knife."
1,Knife and Knife pouch incompatible,I ordered 2 Swiss army knives and 2 pocketknife pouches that were displayed on the same screen and were marketed together. (People who bought the knife also bought ...etc.)The knives came from one source; the pouches from another. The knives arrived as promised; the pouches arrived the following week. The pouch did not fit the knife (knife too large or pouch too small). Free delivery did not apply to the pouches which came from a source in New Hampshire - surprise!
1,Poor Service!,"Swiss Army has great products, but I will NEVER do service with them online again!!! First I ordered this product, then after a month went by and it still wasn't sent, I deleted my order. A couple weeks later, I received the product, even though I deleted my order. I just immediately returned it. It took over FIVE MONTHS for me to receive my refund!... and I received nastly e-mails from customer service accusing me of never returning the product. If you want to buy something from Swiss Army, I strongly advise going to a store to get it!!!"
3,what a useless collection,"I don't give this three stars for the actual music; I give it three stars because it is an ill-conceived, useless collection. Any real Harrison fan is also a Beatles fan, and will have all the tracks on ""side one"". ""Side Two"" contains only the solo singles (i.e. no strong album tracks), and includes no b-sides that aren't available on album. In fact, the only song that a real Harrison fan can't get on the original albums is Bangla Desh, which is OK but certainly not prime Harrison.Now, just a word about the state of Harrison's catalog. Has any major artist been less well served in the CD age? OK, his catalog was available for a while with disappointing remastering, but almost all of it has now been cut out. I read rumors that ATMP is being remastered (remixed?) and rereleased. Is it true?Anyway, don't buy this. It's outdated, poorly compiled and poorly remastered. Let's just hope that Harrison will get better treatment in the future."
1,"COME ON, THIS IS A JOKE !!","Release a George Harrison compilation and call it ""BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON"", when half of it contains BEATLE songs is a total absurd, which shows clearly the unique intention of earning money. What a shame."
3,"Underappreciated, yes.","5 stars for the music, 0 stars for the thought behind this compilation. Now this would be my choice for a George Harrison best of (at least from his Apple label days):My Sweet Lord, What Is Life, Isn't it a Pity (WHY isn't this included?), Awaiting On You All, Beware Of Darkness, All Things Must Pass, Bangla Desh, Deep Blue (B side that ought to be included somewhere, about the death of his mother, I believe), Give Me Love, Miss O'Dell (B-side only release of Give Me Love), Living In the Material World, Dark Horse, I Don't Care Anymore (B-side, Dark Horse single), Ding Dong Ding Dong (a single, you know--why isn't it here??), You, (This Guitar) Can't Keep from Crying (another single from Extra Texture).I compiled this listing in 5 minutes. Why does it take 25+ years for EMI to release a half decent compilation of this great and now missed artist?"
3,Good CD,"The lyrics are great of course being George Harrison's, but not enough music is heard on each track of this CD. Music and lyrics could be better balanced."
4,Good but fragmented.,"This album is from 1976 and there are no songs from 80's.First 7 tracks came from Beatles albums and I think it is the best of Harrison in Beatles period.The other tracks from Harrison solo albums are good, but fragmented. There are some songs which missed this best of.Reason is that this was first released od LP format."
3,"Best of ""Geroge""?","All you need to know about the production value of this album can be summarized by the glaring error found in the all-to-brief liner notes: ""Produced by Geroge Harrison."" Plus, George Harrison already has a greatest hits album. It's called ""All Things Must Pass, one of the top 10 albums in rock history. Even the worst ATMP track surpasses supposed 'greatest hits' like ""You.""Okay - here's one reason to own ""Best of..."": If you don't own a copy of ""Abbey Road"" or otherwise don't have a track of ""Here Comes the Sun"" buried somewhere in your CD collection, then I recommend buying this CD. It's a song with such a universal message and brilliant simplicity that it will be playing every day the sun shines after a ""long cold lonely winter"" 300 years from now."
4,The Best of George Harrison,"I wish there had been more post-Beatles songs like ""Dear One"" because I personally love his spiritual songs. All this is subjective, of course, but highlights include ""Something,"" ""Here Comes the Sun,"" ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" ""My Sweet Lord, and ""Give Me Love,"" so that's five winners, but there are eight other songs that are far inferior. It should really be called ""The Most Popular ..."" rather than ""The Best ...."""
4,Great album,It makes you question why more Harrison songs weren't featured on the Beatles albums. My favorit solo Beatle artist by far! This album is amazing and I highly recomend it.
3,Wish it had more.,They need to have a Greatest Hits CD with all his early and later works. Several songs that George Harrison recorded are not included in this compilation. I was very disappointed.
3,bad mixing!,"I think the songs are great. Being a life-long Beatles fan, I had no idea these songs were written by George (at the time they played on the radio), so it's great he finally ""got some respect."" My big beef with this CD is the mix is bad! Like on, ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" there's too much cymbals in some places and not enough of bass in others. The mix is different than the original recording in other songs, too, is all I can say. Also, a bit into the song, it sort of slows down a bit and sounds ""wobbly."" I'm wondering if we bought an illegal copy and it was done badly, although we bought it at Fry's. Then again, you never know who delivers to these guys. It could have ""fallen off a truck."" Does anyone else have this problem? Some other songs are excellent recordings, though."
5,"George hardly the ""Quiet Beatle""","George is so versatile. I like all his music--even the stuff that didn't get played on the radio a lot. ""Something"" is definitely my favorite Harrison tune. My teenage daughter has discovered this CD and LOVES ""Give me Love"" and ""What is Life"". I can hardly keep this in my car, she keeps borrowing it. Guess it's time to buy another one so we can both listen!"
2,"Where's ""Got My Mind Set On You""?","For one thing, why fill up the album with Beatles songs? I mean, the songs are great, and I don't mean to criticize the actual songs, but why include so many Beatles tracks? And why not ""Got My Mind Set On You""? Doesn't sound like greatest hits."
3,Inconsistent.. but does have its moments.,"This is a rather inconsistent representation of George Harrison's career.. It starts off with some of the songs he wrote for the Beatles.. and the some of his early solo work. Well, there are some great songs here.. 'Here comes..', 'Think For Youself' and 'While My guitar..' are all memorable songs.. But the real George Harrison can be found on 'Best Of Dark Horse..' which is, unfortunately out of print.. (What are they thinking??)"
2,"Not really the ""Best Of""","One thing that took points off of this album was that half of it are Beatle tracks. I have pretty much every Beatle album, so they don't do anything for me. And another problem, some of his biggest hits are repetitive. (""My Sweet Lord"" and ""Give Me Love"") ""You"" has to be his worst song here. It's overproduced (by Spector, go figure), but is kinda funny anyways. ""Dark Horse"" and ""What Is Life"" are the best ones here. I am hoping they'll rerelease ""Best Of Dark Horse 1976-89"" sometime, at least all solo George Harrison songs are there."
4,An good album,"This is a really good album if you want the best of George in his Beatles and early solo years. These are the Apple company years, before his Dark Horse record label years which arent made anymore. You can only buy the Dark Horse records at auctions or rare record stores. The album is good because it spans over his Beatle and early solo years. It even has the song ""Bangla Desh"" where you cant find anywhere else. The Best songs on it are ""Something"", ""Here comes the sun"" ,""Think for yourself"", ""My sweet Lord"" , ""Give me love"", ""You""(one of my favorites), and ""What is Life"". Actually they are all great! Id only buy this if you want the song ""Bangla Desh"" or if you dont want to buy all of his albums."
3,not enough tracks,"george had many other great songs worth being in a best of collection. many, many solo songs should be here. one example, i believe should have been included, is the sweet ""blow away"". hope that cd is re-released soon."
3,Isn't It A Pity!,"""Think for Yourself,"" ""For You Blue,"" ""You,"" ""Bangladesh,"" and ""Dark Horse"" should not have been on this CD because they are second-rate songs that were not hits, and what in hell were the producers of this CD thinking when they left ""Isn't It A Pity"" off this CD, which was a first-rate song and a hit?"
3,Good to a point,"If you like Harrison, but not necessarily the Beatles, this is for you. It has all his memorable Beatles' songs and then his solo work up to about 1976. But that was 15 years ago. What are we to do today wi th his other works? I suggest that a new compilation be made, sans the Beatles stuff. Put all his best solo works in one compilation and you will have a 5-star album. But, like I said, if you're a Harrison fan like me, buy this for now, if you don't have any of his albums. ""Bangla Desh"" is an increidbly powerful song. ""My Sweet Lord,"" ""Give Me Love"" and ""What Is Life"" are also good songs. ""You"" isn't. It seems too commercial for my liking. Think Backstreet Boys. ""Dark Horse"" is a good song, but George sounds like he his throat is a little ""hoarse."" If you don't have much money and want Harrison stuff, buy this, its a good place to start. But I suggest buying his solo albums separately."
3,All Fans Must Pass,"Trying to sell this compilation as THE BEST of George Harrison is a bit of a rip-off really. Half of the collection is George's songs from his BEATLES days so the title BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON is a bit deceiving. George has a solid solo catalogue (no really big hits, but they DO stand on their own merit). I am trying desperately to find the REAL Best of George Harrison, his solo work from 1975 onward. No where can I find gems like ""Crackerbox Palace"" and ""Blow Away"" and ""All Those Years Ago"" and ""Cloud Nine"". If the record people TRULY want to give the public THE BEST of George Harrison, do it the RIGHT way. GEORGE HARRISON 1970-1987. It is wrong to sell us Beatles songs as SOLO efforts and call it the BEST of the individual artist. I've bought half this CD before . . . why did I have to buy it twice. C'mon George . . . give us what we WANT!!!"
2,Why so many Beatles songs?,"The Beatles were an amazing band, no doubt about it, but this compilation is supposed to be the best of GEORGE. There is no need to fill half the album with Beatles tracks; that's what Beatles Greatest Hits are for. George had so many good album tracks that were not included, such as ""Isn't it a Pity"" and ""All Things Must Pass."" I would much rather have those songs than yet another reproduction of Beatles-era songs.My advice is to pick up ""All Things Must Pass"" and ""Cloud 9."" Those two, to me, are the best albums of George's solo career. And you can find the Beatles songs on their ""best of"" CDs."
4,Dollars and (common) cents.,"I'm going to rate this CD based on a $1 per song cost to total cost for the entire CD (Apple and Rhapsody charge $1 per song).This CD is hard to judge. Amazon is charging $12 for the CD. There are $7 worth of good songs on here, but 4 of them are songs George wrote while with the Beatles. So if you are a Beatles fan, you are buying music you already own (songs: Something, Here Comes the Sun, Taxman and While My Guitar Gently Weeps). The three great solo songs on this CD are My Sweet Lord, Give Me Love and What Is Life. To get his ""Dark Horse"" hits 'Got My Mind Set On You', 'When We Was Fab' and 'All Those Years Ago', you have to buy a different CD. Unfortunately, there are no Beatles songs or George Harrison songs available on iTunes to date. If you can, hold off and wait for iTunes to make the solo songs available or wait for a Greatest Hits CD that includes all six solo songs on it. George Harrison - RIP.Hope this helps.DariumJune 2007"
3,Serviceable Compilation That Needs To Be Retired.,"The three stars isn't for the music; needless to say, the music's great! But George had put out quite a few things since 1976, and for this antiquated album to serve as his sole career retrospective is truly a pity. I can only presume that this situation will be rectified soon, and considering the class and attention lavished on his recently re-released regular albums, it will be worth the wait."
1,Dark Horse? More like Lame Duck!,"Who is this George Harrison? I bought this CD because a friend told me it was full of ""retro""- sounding contemporary ""hip"" alternative tunes that would help me understand what kind of stuff my kids are into. Instead, I get this odd stuff that sounds older even than me. And my kids just laugh when I try to relate to them in ""Dark Horse"" lingo. Why are they laughing at me??? If you want to but a CD that your kids are listening to so that you do not feel like a ""stick in the mud"" when driving them to and from school, by all means do NOT but this one. It sounds like it was recorded in the '70's!"
3,Contract fulfillment album,"Believe me... I'm a George Harrison fan. I have every album... but this one. The only reason to buy this album is for the song ""Bangla-Desh"" which is only available here on CD. I give it 3 stars simply because that song is on here and it's a great tune. I read somewhere that George himself doesn't even like this album, and tried to stop them from putting it out. The Beatles recordings and George on one album is something I'll never understand. He had plenty of songs back then to make a ""Best Of"" album. This was put out to fulfill his contract at Capitol Records. I suggest buying all the original albums. Those I would give all 5 stars."
5,"Great, yet short, collection","Yep, George always was given short shrift. While this collection contains some of his most memorable and well written/performed songs, it is woefully inadequate as far as length (which belies it's origins as an LP).Of note is that this is the least expensive place to get the studio version of ""Bangladesh."" All of the rest are, of course, easily found on Beatles' and other Harrison albums"
3,Best of George Harrison?,"Although I have full collection of ""The Beatles's CD"", I still want to own this CD. Because I love George Harrison's song, such as ""Here comes the Sun"", ""My Sweet Lord"" , ""You"" and What is Life"". But I also like ""Ding Dong, Ding Dong"" which was a song in the chart.I hope the record company would issue the real "" George Harrsion solo best album"" in the near furture. Do not try to include any Beatles in the album. I would like to include some songs from ""Somewhere in England"", Cloud Nine"". There are a lot of George's solo hits!"
5,"Great, but...?","I love this but where, on CD, can I find ""Crackerbox Palace"" and ""Here Comes the Moon""...is it released anywhere? Shouldn't they be on a Greatest Hits CD?"
3,"Worth it for ""Bangla Desh""","My biggest complaint about this album has always been the inclusion of Beatles songs. I would have to assume that most people interested in George's solo work would already be familiar with, and would already OWN classic Beatles songs such as ""Something"" and ""Here Comes the Sun"". The inclusion of these songs seems redundant and unnecessary to me. However if you don't happen to own these Beatles tracks, needless to say they are must-haves.Still, George had plenty of enjoyable solo material by 1976 that could have made it onto this collection instead. The stuff that is included is great, but there could have been more. The disc's most redeeming quality is the presence of ""Bangla Desh"", George's 1971 single that never appeared on an album before this one. You won't find the studio version on any other CD. Some day I'm sure there will be a more comprehensive collection of George's Apple material, but until then this is all that's out there."
2,Outdated,"Unless you stopped listening to the radio in 1976, THE BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON will seem half-baked. Certainly anyone who thinks of the ex-Beatle's biggest records would look for several songs not yet made when this collection came out.The June 28, 2001, reviewer's list of songs that should appear on a proper George Harrison hits album covers the biggest tunes of Harrison's career. But even in the context of the Harrison work available when THE BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON was released, why not fill it out with solo album tracks instead of Beatles songs? Oh, well, too late now."
3,solid,"George is a great guitarist and has some ver good vocal take Her comes the sun and Long, Long, Long,. But I like his creer with the Beatles better than after personal opinion. Best song on album Here comes the sun. GodBless"
2,dont buy this! it is a mono!!!,"I need ya, you like me too much, old brown shoe were George's song during the beatles time, but he failed to make a success as a soloist, I dont know whether george (RIP) was a big soloist, I dont think if he had a chance to do the things by him self. especially this cd was recorded in mono only! don't fool your self Beatle die hard fans!"
5,The Knight Who Was Afraid of the Dark,"I use this book with my fifth grade students, reading part of the book and then having them write their own ending, before revealing the ending by the author. They love this fairy tale. It's just the right mix of love story, bad guys and action, and good wins over evil. All told in a very mild, safe, appropriate manner. The pictures are fun and filled with imagination. It's a great combination and I highly recommend this book."
5,You'll Be Reading This Again and Again!,"Go ahead, try not to fall in love with this gentle knight story. Detailed, captivating illustrations will keep your kids enthralled while the story stealthily imparts a universal lesson of facing your fears and the power of love. A good hearted knight, a heroine, a bad guy, fireflies and electric eels. Sigh. You'll be reading this again and again."
4,mountain interval,"It is beyond my poor power to add or detract from this book. I can only say, that Robert Frost is a favorite of mine. This book is inexpensive and so, people with limited resources can enjoy the work of this master. Download it, keep it avaialble for a while, read bits and pieces peroodically and enjoy."
4,A nice collection,"Robert Frost is one of my favorite poets with ""The Road Less Travelled"" being one of my favorite poems. This book is perfect for keeping handy so the poems can be read and enjoyed over and over, shared with family or friends, etc."
1,Not buying Gemini again,This is the second Gemini mic I have bought and neither worked. I had to send in the first one back to the factory right out ot the box and now this latest one did not even make it through one show and is not working. I am sending it back to the factory and telling them I want my money back but am sure they will not do it.
5,Excellent Wireless Microphone,"Bought this set locally.The receiver is equipped with a balanced XLR output and a 1/4"" output.The mic runs very long on two AA batteries and could also be fitted with two rechargeable AA's. Therefore it comes equipped with a charging cable, to be charged from the receiver unit.I use it for functions and karaoke. The range was always sufficient, never had any dropouts.What amazes me is the sound this mic delivers. For my opinion it is the best sounding microphone I ever owned. To me and with my voice it sounds better than wired Shure SM58, Beyer Dynamic and Sennheiser microphones I owned. I wish I could buy a microphone with the same characteristics as a wired mic....It sounds warm but still with a brilliant presence. It is very sensitive but not problematic for feedbacks.It comes with 19"" rack adapters, all you need to locate is a extra wide mic clamp if you want to mount it on a stand.Trust me, you can't go wrong with it, especially for the price!!!"
5,Best wireless Mic for the money!!!,"I am a Wedding and Event DJ performing every weekend. I was referred this microphone by another colleague who had been using it for years. Yes Gemini is not known for it's ""high end"" equipment, but I thought I would give it a try as I knew another professional was using it regularly. I could not be impressed more! I have used this for the past month and a half with no drop outs and very good range! I have used this mic both indoors and outdoors and wonder why I didn't buy this mic years ago. The only catch between this mic and the more high end ones is that you have to manually set the uhf channel for the location you will be using it. A simple internet search will get you the ""open"" channels that work in that particular zip code.Overall, I have used Shure, Audio Technica, and other high end brands, but this one for the price and quality stands up to each. I will be purchasing another as a backup!"
4,"The Town on the Hassayampa:A History of Wickenburg, Arizona","This book is designed to be a textbook as well as a general information book. Each chapter addresses a different issue that is important to Arizona such as water, mining, railroads, ranching and others. I like the way the book is laid out for that purpose. It covers the growth and development for Wickenburg, but will mirror many other towns in Arizona. I especially like the way Mark Pry personalizes the town. He has a good way of presenting history not only as fact, but as living history. A good example is the way he writes of the town's spirit after it had been devastated by the Walnut Grove Dam flood. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the history of Arizona."
4,Wickenburg typifies Arizona history,"This book did a good job of describing the typical Arizona town. I found particularly interesting the way that the book showed an informative amount of backgroung on the progression of this small town without boring the reader. The pictures were a particularly nice touch, especially for me, and other visually-oriented readers like me. This is a must-read for anyone interested in Wickenburg's history, and even for those interested in Arizona history, or the history of the West in general for that matter."
3,good but incomplete soundtrack,"a good selection of music from this 80's iconic film however no music from Jack Nitzsche is featured at all and this is a crying shame.would anyone know where i can find the piece of music towards the end of the film where Elizabeth leaves john's apartment for the last time, this music is beautiful !!"
3,Missing Track...,"I have this movie ... and there's this one song in particular in the movie that is NOT on the soundtrack. I've been trying to find out who it is for a while now...The part where ""Liz"" & ""John"" go into that one underground store and he pays cash for that hot executive suit for her... there's a song in the background ... does anyone know who that is or which song it is???Thanks!"
3,Missing Reggae song,HELP! Does anybody know if one can buy the fantastic piece of the reggae band on the street Liz is grooving to while stroling over the garage sale (the key scene with scarf and hen)?Unfortunately it is missing on the soundtrack.
3,A half-complete but nice compilation soundtrack,"I'll start by clarifying that there is NO GRACE JONES on this soundtrack -- CD or film -- although early home video packaging claimed this for years! BUT how can you NOT include Jack Nitzsche's beautiful original score (see closing scene's 'Love Theme')?! AND, omit these great other songs in the film (as noted by an earlier reviewer):1.Love and Happiness - Al Green | 2.The Strayaway Child - Andy Narell | 3.Savior-Winston Grennan(reggae song in street market scene) | 4.Strange Fruit - Billie Holiday | 5.Selection from ""Ambient Music I: Music for Airports"" - Brain Eno | 6.Voices - Brian Eno | 7.Arpeggiator - Jean Michel JarreNow, I've owned this soundtrack for the 25 years, or so, it's been out, and do love what's on there, but I must give it a 3-star rating due to it's great missing material. Hopefully, someone might produce a comprehensive soundtrack for the film's 30th anniversary since they've missed-the-boat on the 25th already."
3,Great characters....,"Great characters, but too many for me. I got irritated that every chapter was a new character. Please, keep it to 3 characters!"
4,Grows on You,"Much like Heavy Soul, it takes a few listens to get the full impact. Once you find the groove, however, it's fairly irresistable. On a par with Wildwood in the Weller pantheon. Seems to be a synthesis of all the previous Weller incarnations (Jam, Style Council, solo). A bit of a lull on tracks 4-6, but closes very strong. String arrangements are fantastic, and the drum solo on Picking up Sticks is a hoot. Previous statement should give you some idea of the diversity of this CD."
1,Paul's worst-I was hoping it was a joke,"Being a fan of old time rock and roll, punk, and new wave, the Jam and a lot of Pauls solo works have always been appealing to me(in other words, I am a big fan). But this ""progressive"" type of album with tuneless long songs, totally bored me. theres 2 trax that are passable: Sweet pea and NO drinking when your dead. Otherwise, I cant figure out if he is being serious or not,its that bad. Pains me to say so since I am such a big fan. This one is strictly for Paul/jam completists."
1,This Is The Modern World?,"If there is a hell; it surely is becoming everything that we despise. Paul Weller is living his private hell, as he has turned into everything he despised when he was leader of the greatest band in the free world (The Jam).Pete Townshend is looking like more of a purist than Weller. Get back to your woods Paul."
1,Shockingly Bad,"I have to start by saying that I have been a huge fan of every sound Paul has ever recorded since In The City (which I still listen to on vinyl.) That being said, this isn't just a bad Paul Weller album; it would be a bad Winger album. I kept listening to it, trying to find a redeeming quality. Sorry Paul, it seems we both failed."
3,"I guess the title should go here, but 2day I won't conform !","A bare bones review. I think only Weller fans will fully appreciate this album, I think the first six songs are quite catchy, in fact when I first listened to the album I though, keep-em commin', but they didn't, after the 7th, 'No drinkin' when your dead' or something, it takes a downward turn.I don't know, I guess there must be something in the musical water because really great bands aren't coming out with really great music any more, such as Mr Weller & radiohead is another artist/band which comes to mind. Ah-well, I guess all think's must come to an end !!"
5,Beautiful Sounds from a Work of Art,"The Luna Fauna Phoenix Acoustic guitar has rainbow colored abalone inlay galore, from the phoenix design on the body, and the swirl around the sound hole, to the logo on the headstock. It is absolutely beautiful. It is also a great sounding acoustic-electric guitar. It has a very warm, full sound. It is lightweight and easy to play. The pre-amp has a tuner, so it is quite easy and convenient to stay in tune all the time. The hardest thing about this guitar is keeping it out of the hands of the other guitar players in your home--it is quite irresistible! Be sure to order the hard case to protect its beauty--also available from Amazon."
5,Fabulous Guitar,"Although not a Luna fanatic like some... my new guitar has served me quite well on stage and with my songwriting. First, the guitar (my Phoenix) is extremely attractive and draws many an admirer. Beacuse of it's ease of play, I have found myself spending much more guitar time than with my previous full-sized Takamine. I have so many pick marks on the guitar because of so much stage time with my guitar I now find the flaws on the face near the sound hole to be a badge of honor as opposed to a flawed guitar (Willie Nelson). I would recommend this guitar to anyone.RR"
3,Ningun Novato,"En La Hojarasca (la primera novela de don Gabo), se destaca su habilidad innata de escribir. Las primeras respiraciones de Macondo como protagonista, la originalidad de su tecnica narrativa y la elocuencia de su sintaxis, visibles en sus futuras obras, nacen de esta. Fue un placer (al fin) leer la novela que es la cuna de ""Cronica"", ""Cien Anios"", ""El Coronel"", etc.Ciertos aspectos a cultura de Latinoamerica (el resentimiento, la aceptacion de lo socialmente correcto, etc) se conocen aqui por primera vez a traves de los ojos de Macondo de GGM."
3,Paralela a Cien Años,"La Hojarasca es una historia que corre a la par con Cien Años de Soledad, se situa tambien en el mágico Macondo aunque la familia Buendia no es la protagonista: es el pueblo en si. La hojarasca es como el fin de el orden establecido en Macondo. El libro es corto y muy sencillo para leer, además tiene un peculiar estilo: tres personas narran la historia, el niño, el Coronel e Isabel en tiempos paralelos. Es interesante y bien recomendado."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,This is a horrible movie. Bad acting. Bad script. Situations that are not believable. One of the worst movies I have seen.
5,Only book needed for firewalling from beginner to advanced,"The only book needed for firewalling from beginner to advanced level. Contains full introduction to tcp/ip, consulting and setup of firewall in the chapters. Also comes with pictures and diagrams for better easier understanding. There are more than 20 firewalls documented for references.A great book to have for advanced referencing and also casual reading."
1,Disorganized and all but unreadable.,"I can't comment on the whole book because I was unable to continue reading it. The English is atrocious and was obviously not edited very well. The explanations are haphazard and off the cuff, with no aparent plan for conveying information. There may be lots of useful information here, but the presentation is terrible."
2,More 'Network Security Overview' than 'Firewalls Complete',"For a book called 'Firewalls Complete', it spent a rather small percentage of its considerable bulk on firewalls. To be fair, I have to admit that I'm not counting the very large section reviewing firewall products. I'm not interested in procuring a firewall, just in knowing what they are and how they work. For a sysadmin evaluating firewalls, I imagine it's very useful. Much more time was spent (in several sections) on security policy. Important, no doubt, but not why I bought the book. Very vague on topics like SOCKS and http tunneling. After reading this, I still don't have a solid understanding of common firewall configurations and best practices, nor of the relationships between the technologies involved."
2,Weak in every respect,"I don't think the author had ever reread what he's written. The book doesn't respect any logic in presenting things, some of which are covered with a lot of technical details, the others - just mentioned by the way (God knows why). The text is repetitive, difficult to read (ok, English is my 3rd language), and the diagrams sometimes conflict with the explanations, which only contributes to the general mess. Save your money for something more clear."
3,Full of information but difficult to read,This book is extremely useful as a reference for Firewalls in general and contains much information about encryption standards. It is however difficult to read and inconsistent. Some of the topics are extremely hard to follow and I have had to purchase additional material to fully understand the subject area. It is however recommended for those looking for in-depth explanations on the details of Firewalling in general.
5,So that's what happened to Bloody Mary...,Nini X!? LMAO!!! This is Bloody Mary from the original Bangin' on Wax Bloods and Crips debut album. I know I was surprised to learn that Crip Genuine Draft was actually Domino using a psuedonym as well...This is a nice album for all Bloody Mary fans...She sounds a lot like CMG from Conscious Daughters too. That old 1994 hardcore gangsta sound reverberates through this release. A nice addition to any West Coast collection...Check it out!
5,VFPers now have the tool as reference WEB development,"If we (VFPers) wanted to stay competitive in the arena of Software Development, we should be thinking of migrating apps into the Internet. This book is a perfect guide for us to build dynamic WEB Applications. Now, I am little bit at ease because VFP really is a powerful tool and I don't have anymore pressure to look for another just for WEB building."
5,Simply the best book and software combination for VFP/Net,Rick Strahl has created an application that is by far the most robust application for using Visual Foxpro to build Internet/Intranet applications.
1,Not Learning Properly,"Thanks to Ms. Harris I am unfortunately completely turned off to the whole NLP concept. As the previous reviewer mentioned, this book is poorly written, has very unimaginative examples (when EVEN PRESENTED), some of the most irrelevant information ever, ETC. And yeah, where was the editor? Skip this PLEASE."
4,The Tandem Scoop: An Insiders Guide to Tandem Cycling,The Tandem Scoop: An Insiders Guide to Tandem Cycling. Good quick read with plenty of advice and options in the likelihood of one beginning a rental start up business.
3,not straight,"Brass finish is okay but after installing it, I noticed it wasn't straight, had a small wave in it. I think I can put some glue or double sided adhesive into the wave and perhaps it will straighten out against the door. You get what you pay for."
5,A chronicle of hope,"This brief eloquent book is a treasure. The history of the battle for Utah wilderness is a story that needs to be read by everyone who visits the redrock deserts and National Parks of Utah, and by everyone who lives in the region. Our astounding wild landscapes are not there by accident, but because there are people who love and defend them. The photos show places that would be protected if America's Redrock Wilderness Act were passed into law. These are the places that could be lost forever if public lands were privitized (as wise-use and sagebrush rebel groups would like) or managed for industrial tourism, resource extraction and grazing (as the BLM seems inclined to do). I hope that in the future this book becomes a triumphant chronicle of the vision and persistance that saved Utah's public lands wilderness instead of a sad chronicle of what was lost."
4,the music says it all,I saw these guys live at the Crocodile Cafe with Pedro the Lion. I went to see Pedro and did not know either of the opening bands. By the time that Seldom was done with their first song I couldn't wait for the next. This CD is exactly like their live sound (which is very rare this day in age). I am proud to say that I love this CD and listen to it constantly. The only reason that I don't think that it deserves a fifth star is for one reason. Although the music is very good it is not something that makes me feel as though I could die where I stand and everything would be OK.
2,No shipping?,"We have been looking for a frame like this for a few weeks, with no luck in town. I figured we would try Amazon, and found these, which are perfect. I tried to buy this frame, along with the 8.5x11"" and it's not allowing me. After jumping through hoops to get my Amazon password reset it will not let me proceed with checkout, saying that it cannot ship to my address. When I click on ""learn more"" it tells me they can't ship to PO Boxes. I am entering in my physical address.I have a feeling it's because I'm in Alaska, but no where does it say that they do not ship to Alaska. After clicking on ""shipping rates,"" I see it says ""Continental USA"" but Alaska is still on the North American continent, making Alaska ""continental."""
1,Permanently Dirty Glass,"I received 3 frames, 6x8, and when I opened them to install pictures I saw that 2 of the 3 had dirty glass. I tried to clean them with many cleaners and solvents. the glass is etched with something. I am going to look into buying replacement glass because I need them for gifts. I cannot find any way to let Amazon know how bad this product is."
2,Broken,"Glass was broken when it arrived..... No problem with the return... Other then that, they looked nice until we saw the broken glass.."
2,Poor Quality,I am sorely disappointed in this purchase. The frames were just what I wanted but the condition they arrived in is unacceptable. The glass was cloudy and scratched. I tried to clean them with windex but that only removed the grime. The scratches are still there. I thought I would just add new glass but one of the frames is scratched as well. They were wrapped up nicely in corner protectors and bubblewrap but the damage was under the preshrunk plastic. I'm guessing it's too much trouble to send them back and I probably can't since I tried to clean them anyway. What a waste of money.
2,"BORING, didn't finish",My book club chose this book. At page 250 I was so bored I put it down. Not finishing a book is a first for me.
3,Okay.,"A Portrait of a Lady is interesting in a way that it explores the psychological aspects of love, and the dangers that come along with having the wrong view. Individualism is a pivotal theme in this novel. Basically, the heroine faces her own personal battle in between pleasing herself and pleasing others in who she ought to marry. Isabel Archer starts off strong in the beginning, but progressively loses herself (and her love of independence) when she rejects two suitors for someone who is after her money."
2,Reminded me of a Soap Opera,"Rich people and the traps that they set for themselves. I had a hard time relating to the subject matter.Henry James is an excellent author, his cheracters are vivid, his stories very well written but Mr. James was born into money and it shows all through this story.I found the frequent use of French phrases and expressions inconvenient because I had to keep referring to the appendix to be able to follow the story.Although I enjoyed the story, my enjoyment was tinged with the impression that the people in the story had too much time on their hands and were in need of more constructive pursuits than meddling in the lives of others."
2,Classic?,"I couldn't really get into Henry James' ""Portrait of a Lady"". I found it dull and repetitive."
4,Too sharp,"These are great knives --but they're almost too sharp! I sliced into a finger the first time I used em, because I'm so used to blunt kitchen implements, I wasn't giving them the proper attention! Even the scissors are spookily sharp.Of course, if you aren't a klutz like me, these are remarkable chef's tools."
5,Slice & Dice It,"After much research, I bought a couple of Wusthof Classic knives last year. I absolutely love them! They handle extrenely well and have a great sturdy grip. I had my eye on a larger knife set but kept putting it off due to the money. I couldn't see spending that much money for knives. Well, I was wrong! It is worth every penny and the storage unit is a must! You can't leave the knives in your dishrack to dry. I think I damaged the point in doing so. I'm not sure how I can exchange just 1 knife out of the set. I can't survive with returning the entire set and wait for a replacement. I'll need to research how to do this.Anyway, the quality of the Classic set (as this is one of the higher rated models compare to other Wusthof models) is superb! The knives cut whole watermelons & butternut squash like butter! These are a keepsake which can be passed down in your family! I wish there was a discount for buying more than one set because I would have for our second home!"
3,Disappointed,"We bought our Wusthof Classic knives about a year and a half ago and have never used them roughly. I was so disappointed today to discover that the handles are breaking down. I can see it, I guess, if we ever banged them around, but we use proper cutting boards and use each style knife for its purpose. The handles shouldn't be cracking/splintering like this.On the positive side, I love the blades. They take a super sharp edge and keep it for quite a while."
4,Dope!,"Very nice album. Not as good as Second Nature but close. Production by Molemen, Capital D and No I.DTop cuts are 50 Years, Its OK, Portals of Sound and Time Pieces. Dope underground album for those who enjoy the likes of Common, Mos De, Kweli or The Roots."
4,"this was their 1st album, not their 2nd. see: REISSUE","dummy smacks for the previous reviewer for not knowing this was their debut. solid hip-hop, nothing mind blowing. cap D's flow is rather boring, but his rhymes have substance. molemen beats are just solid, typical east coast fare.more of a 3.5 IMO."
5,great dance warm up mix!,My childhood dance life revolved around this album! I love how all the songs flow into each other for a flawless transition between movements. This album always puts me in a great mood!!
1,Self-Publishers Lack Talent,"This book has only one poem of merit. Otherwise, the author's entireSELF-PUBLISHED ""VANTITY-PRESS"" ramblings show notalent; which reveals the author's need to self-publish!!Her poems describe in words... instead of in descriptive narrative;the mark of a definite amateur of no talent.Ms. Shults needs to stick to her good looks and leavethe writing to those of true talent.I rate this book ONE star for there is ONE poem that mightpass the muster. Otherwise, the author has no usable talent; her writing is shallow and without meaningful feeling to the masses. Perhaps her family might understand her poetry. Alas, her leaves need left to family gatherings and spare the masses from redneck ramblings.And $999 is a lot to spend to self-publish such nonsense."
5,Save a trip to the Salon,Always professional results. Easy to use. Cannot get it in stores.!!!! Try it. No need for a trip out. !!!! !!!!
4,Quantum Body Perm,This is a great permanent that I have used for many years. Finding itthrough Amazon was a very easy way to get it.
2,Fooling,"When I ordered this, I guess I should have read that it was a reusable adhesive type skin. From the picture, it looks like a skin you actually slip onto the DS. I was so disappointed to find out this was not the case and I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it or find for one that actually encloses the entire DS.The skin only has a sticker for the top, bottom, top inside, and for around the buttons on either side on the inside. It's definitely not worth the 10 dollars for a bunch of stickers to put on your DS especially if it doesn't cover all the edges and stuff."
1,This book is awesome,"I read this book and it helped me to play the game. I like to play games because they are fun to play. I have not played clock tower 2 yet but I think that I will like it just as much as Tomba because Tomaba was a fun game, almost as fun as that game I made. That game I made was really fun because I read the clock tower 2 book and that helped me make my game. If your looking to make your own game I would strongly recomend you buy this book! Sometimes when I am reading this book I get really scared and I put the book down and start to cry. I dont like to cry because then my dad makes fun of me and I dont like it when he makes fun of me because it is not fun. And that is my review of Tomba aka the greatest game ever made THE END"
2,too easy to break,I purchased this kennel to crate train an adopted dog with seperation anxiety. After less than a month the dog was able to break the lower lip where the door sits and escape. After contacting pet mate they said the warrenty doesnt cover crate training a dog only a dog that is already trained. Tough break. I bought another one at petsmart for cheaper as well.
5,Excellent introduction to MRI,"Written by one of the pioneers of modern imaging, William Oldendorf, it is one of the best introductions to understanding the physics underlying MRI. Even if it somewhat dated in the sense that is was written well before the era of fast imaging as we know today it is still unsurpassed in its clarity."
2,Don't Get Ripped Off,"Goodtimes has a lot of nerve charging 40 bucks for this low quality print. For about 13 dollars LESS, you can get a better quality print of this PLUS all thirteen episodes of the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour PLUS other bonus materials. Yes, the ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Seasons 7-9"" DVD, which is currently available on Amazon for $27 includes this Lucy-Desi Westinghouse special as a bonus feature, and in perfect condition AND without the Goodtimes logo appearing on the screen."
5,GREAT ROMANTIC STORY,"My friend passed this book on to me and though I expected little, I really enjoyed it. Sometimes unexpected pleasures are the best. Great salty dialogue and real characters. Real menace too. Had me right until the last page."
2,MUCH TOO REALISTIC FOR THIS READER,"Okay, I'll admit, Knorr can write. But there's more to romance than craft.I don't like realistic romance. I want my girls pure and my heros handsome and manly. This one breaks all the rules. It was shocking! A romantic lead who was a whore? It's unseemly, I tell you! Romance is for maidens, not&#65533; not&#65533; well, ladies of the evening.And the male lead, what of him? A brainy geek? I want Fabio as my protagonists, not some pencil neck with stuffed birds in his bedroom. Give me good old Danielle Steele any day!Keep your fresh and shocking realism. Give me escape."
5,Where do we find inspiration?,"I have two books to recommend to readers if they are looking for books that focus on finding Inspiration. One is Michele Geraldi's Calling in the Night, and the other is Karen Pritzker's My Hero. These books show the importance of finding inspiration and applying it to your everyday life. My Hero is a vast collection of inspirational stories, written by some of the most influential people in the world, during some of the most controversial and trying times the world has ever seen. It does not try to be inspiring, so much as it focuses on the importance of a person finding something in his/her life to be inspired by. There is a big difference there. I found the stories uplifting, and I came from the book knowing that My Hero is a good read and a good tool that teaches a person to always keep his/her eyes open for the one little thing that might move the spirit to become better, and then hopefully, eventually move the spirit's of other people as well."
4,He could be one of the funniest...,"David Tyree's 'Funniest Black Man in America' is more than just a title of self proclamation. It really is a gut buster. After hearing the ablum in it's entirety (over 2 years ago), I was crying with laughter! His sets aren't PC but usually the good ones never are.His comedy targets everybody from the homeless to the drunks...from the rich to the poor and everyone in between. If you laugh at his track 'Test Joke' then you will continue to laugh all the way through the album.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it is hysterical and extremely funny. I didn't give it 5 stars because I believe 5 stars are reserved for comic geniuses like Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks. However, David Tyree comes as close to 5 as he can get.See for yourself why he could very well be one of 'The Funniest Black Man in America'."
3,A good companion to learning Levantine Arabic.,"You're not going to learn how to speak, read, or write Arabic (Levantine or otherwise) from this book. However, it is an excellent companion to a larger study of the language, especially for those interested in the Levantine dialects and those wishing to learn colloquialisms and expressions."
2,A Drum Solo Album,"Yeah, that's right, drum solos and nothing but drum solos. I mean, he's a great individualistic drummer and I love John French (Beefheart, Crazy Backwards Alphabet, Frith/Kaiser, etc.) as much as the next guy, but how often can you listen to an album of nothing but drum solos?A singular experience -- not to be repeated!"
4,Good book,If you are one who likes those post apocalyptic stories of who survives what and even if we should survive as a species.
5,Such a cute movie,"I bought The First Time as a gift for my brother, it's a really cute movie and the price is crazy awesome. It arrived on time. I can't wait to give this to my brother on Christmas!"
2,No Mona Lisa,Having read the unabridged version I approached this abridgement. My experience can be described as comparing the painting of the Mona Lisa with a pencil rendition. The absence of the appendices and the explanatory footnotes together with the gouged text made less traumatic with artificial bridging (abridgement) results in nothing more than a mere pencil sketch of a true masterpiece. There is no substitute for the full version.
1,Buy the original,"Don't buy this. BUY THE ORIGINAL 3 VOLUME. You can try to justify why the abridgment is better but it's all a bunch of nonsense. It says this book is 900 pages; volume 1 of the full set is 700 pages, which means the abridgment is lacking most of the real story. Would you watch a version of Titanic thats 30 mins long, or would you even want someone to buy watered down versions of your work? The original is amazing, buy that one instead."
2,Why not go for the real thing?,Abridgements of great works in and of themselves are not a bad thing. As I read through this volume I could not but help noticing how poorly it reflected upon Freeman's original three volume work.Douglas Southall Freeman's Magnum Opus is distorted quite significantly in this abridgement. If you have not read his original work I suppose this volume will suffice. But why settle? I frequently come across the original volumes at used bookstores for around $50-$60.Mr. Freeman's writing is good literature apart from being great history. Though the original work is dated it still is a magnificient example of historical writing. Mr. Freeman's work is what got me interested in Civil War history.
1,Why I don't buy abridgments,"This work only confirmed my belief that I must quit buying abridgments. The original 3 volume set is so much more complete. One only gets a hint of the original with this balderization. If I want an abridgment, I'll do it myself. Amazon, please get the original set on Kindle."
2,Why abridge an important classic?,"I have not read this abridgement. I gave it two stars because it is still Douglas Southall Freeman, more or less. I have read the three volume set twice now and no doubt will go through it again in the future. In three volumes this is a classic of the genre, books that set the standards for all the others, just like Shelby Foote's three volume compendium. An abridgement of this type is for the novice set. My opinion is that everyone who is interested should get the three original volumes. I believe they can still be found or at least ordered."
4,A good guide for a great game!,"This guide is a good buy, especially if you'd like to go through the game and get most everything on the first round. The maps are good and clearly show the placement of all the stuff you need. I had almost all of the Platinum Bolts and Nanotech Boosts when I finished my game using this guide. The layout is good, and let's the player know exactly what to do next. There are a couple of errors (some objectives for one world were printed again later for another planet) but that detracted very little from the overall quality. If you're having problems with this game, or need help figuring out the Skill Points (I know I did) this is a good buy.Some people say that guides take away from the experience of ""discovery"" in a game. To that I say ""BAH!"", nothing is more satisfying that getting everything you can in a game; and this R&C;:GC guide will help you do just that! Buy it, and enjoy this great game!!"
5,Ratchet & Clank Going Commando Game Guide,"My 10-year-old son likes to be well-informed on the games he plays, and has found this book to be quite helpful."
1,"Good Game, Awful Guide","This guide is probably one of the worst ever. The chapters all look alike. It takes more time to look for what you need in this than to beat the game. The game is pretty simple anyway, so it's not really needed. If you do need help, find an online strategy guide, but save the $10 for something more useful."
5,The Best Movie Ever!!!,"I'm 12 and I'm over-obsessed with Cabbage Patch Kids. I love them so much! I have 2 dolls, 1 tape (music), and 3 out of 4 or 5 videos. I have The Clubhouse, The Screen Test, and The New Kid. I like The Clubhouse the best because it's just very good. The competition between the girls and boys is great, and so are the songs! I hope this helps you...!"
4,Editorial Review,"""A year after releasing their Platinum & Gold greatest-hits collection and two years after their initial greatest-hits compilation, BMG struck yet again with Rick Astley's Artist Collection. The difference between this collection and the other two lies in very small details: there are two extra tracks that were minor hits in Astley's career, and while the Platinum & Gold collection used alternate mixes and edits, the renditions here are the originals. These are extremely minor points that most casual fans won't notice, especially as the biggest hits, 'Never Gonna Give You Up' and 'Together Forever,' are included on Artist Collection. The omission of 'It Would Take a Strong Man' is a bit disconcerting, and makes this one of the few flaws of the whole album. It's a solid collection, but until a definitive release is compiled, Platinum & Gold is still the reference point most casual fans should use for a greatest-hits collection. ~ Rob Theakston, All Music Guide"""
2,"Get ""Bring It On"" Instead","Singer Karl Agell doesn't sound like himself on this album. In fact, I had to look at the credits to make sure it was the same singer. The music is still great but Karl's gone from a unique sound to a generic, bar-band style. This one goes into the ""sell"" pile."
5,Crude Rhymes for the Synth pop generation,"This album is more of an epic tale with 26 songs that move through an assortment of contemporary topics mostly dealing with pop consumerism and the commodification of the human. This being my first introduction to Princess Superstar i was amazed by her roots and where they have taken her since. My favorite track is ""Coochie Coo"" because in combines a melodic sense with fun rhymes that allude to our dirtier sides. Dirty is deffintely my thing, and there is a lot of that here. And i mean that in the sense that there is someone just saying the things that are on everyone's minds and applying it to themes and textures that bring them to life. Overall this is a great album and can offer different reads on every listen. Pick it up and offer up your comments as i would like to see what other fans have to say."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"I like Princess Superstar. I like how she uses her white-girl wiles to approach rap from a more self-aware and less serious angle than everyone else in the game. She's just kewl and that's all there is to it. I like Princess Superstar, but I don't like this album much. The musical composition is the weak link. I didn't much appreciate the musical aspect of what I'd heard of her past work, but I bought this album confident that any musical shortcomings would be made up for by her lyrical and vocal presence. After a few listens that turns out to not be the case. Concetta's cool just isn't enough to make me want to endure the mediocrity of the music. The concept of this album isn't really that strong either. Consumerism, celebrity worship and lack of identity. Yeah that's really original subject matter. I dunno, I'm not trying to be mean, I don't hate it, but I really cannot get into it even though I was determined to. I regret buying it."
5,Go for it!!! Excellent,"If you like Brazilian music (or dance music) this is it. This is one of the top 10 albums in Brazil right now - - Brazilians can't get enough of it . . . and I can't get enough of it. The band is a group of girls (a la Wilson Phillips like) but much more fun, with dance beats and great vocals. It's got a little bit if everything (for everyone) and you won't be sorry. If more albums come out like this one (from Brazil), I can promise you they will overtake the U.S. music populace and surpass us the way the Japaneze have surpassed us in electronics and cars."
3,Ok,Exellent foreign film. Not as good as the book-the movie didn't ruin it for me but for some it might.
3,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Beautiful movie. The costunes are exceptional. The story drags, and is hard to follow in some areas."
3,So are you Chinese or Japanese?,"So asks Hank from ""King of the Hill."" I think the movie is well made. The story is good. But using Chinese actors to play Japanese characters just does not cut it. It adds to Asian stereotyping that ""they all look the same."" Ziyi Zhang, Li Gong, Tsai Chin are all Chinese. You can tell from their facial features and accents. Anyone who can't tell the difference must travel out of the U.S. than depend on Hollywood for the characterization of foreign cultures."
2,Recommendation: Read the book,"As a huge fan of the novel, I was initially excited to see this film on DVD. However, I was very disappointed with this film for a couple of reasons. First, the adaption kept certain scenes for entertainment purposes, while disregarding scenes in the novel that were more key to the overall story. Secondly, many of the characters in the movie seem so one-dimensional.I would recommend anyone interested in the movie to just read the book."
3,Memoirs of a Geisha,"This is a movie that is a little slow. I found it overlong and sometimes annoying. It is a tale of the makings of a geisha and of the long trials and tribulations of her training and rivalry with another older and conniving woman.The ending is obvious, it is different than in the book but satisfying. I will watch it again occasionally as the scenery is beautiful and the acting good."
3,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Before World War II, a Japanese child, Sayuri, who is from a penniless family is sold to a geisha house to work. She tries to escape from the geisha house but fails. Therefore, she has to be a slave forever. Fortunately, there is a geisha who gives her a hand so that she can learn how to be a geisha. She captivates the most powerful men of her day, but is haunted by her secret love, the one man beyond her reach.This film gives us more knowledge about life of a geisha. Those girls learn how to be a geisha in their childhoods. When they grow up, they have to work for amah, usually an old geisha that brings up the little ones. They cannot leave the geisha house before they payoff the debts. There are full of competitions in the geisha's world just as it is in this world. They cannot choose the one they love. The story of geisha is so mysterious to us. This film reveals the mystery and makes me understand more about geisha."
4,"Good, but....",Just saying. There should be Japanese actors portraying Japanese people. Other than that. It's good.
5,Awesome movie!,"This is just a really good story. I wouldn't call it a chick flick, but if your guy can't sit through anything without a bullet or fist flying across the screen every 5 mins, then this might be better for a girl's night in or just to watch alone. It's a little long, but not at all boring to me. If you think you might like it, I'm pretty sure you will!"
3,good movie,"i have read the book, and watched the movie. I have to say of course the book was better. This was still a great movie that for the time alloted did a great job"
5,"Loved the book, Loved the Movie.","If you read the book beforehand, you will notice slight differences between them. Nevertheless, I believe the acting and production was phenomenal.I watched Memoirs of a Geisha with my boyfriend who did not read the book nevertheless he was completely enthralled with the movie. He found it very interesting and entertaining."
2,Old sake in a new bottle.,"If you think Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food or Panda Express is great Chinese food, you are going to love this movie. A story from an novel by an American, a movie directed by a director who came to fame with a musical, and Chinese stars doesn't seem very authentic. I hope you don't think you are getting the real thing. It could just as easily been a western with tough cattle ranchers. A beautiful production but I felt I was chewing the already been chewed."
3,WHERE IS THE GEISHA ?,"I give the movie 2 stars for the story but I gave it 3 stars cause of the customs and the music, I give the book 5 stars.Read the book instead of watching this movie if you don't want to spoil the real story."
2,My girlfriend made me watch this,"There are two movies here. One is a movie about a girl who becomes a geisha. This movie is good. The second movie is a ridiculous unbelievable love story that treats the audience like idiots. Typical for Spielberg - I'm sure he added in that second half of the movie to ""jazz up"" the book a little. Apparently he believes American movie-goers are so dumb, we can't watch a movie if there's no happy ending, even if it goes against everything the movie is about."
2,"If you want to enjoy the movie, don't read the book",I think the movie was beautiful but it does no justice to the book. It had beautiful scenes and beautiful people... that was about it. I cried when I read the book and I barely had any emotion (except perhaps a bit of boredom) when watching the movie. Minor gripe: I couldn't get past the fact that most of the actors were not Japanese.
4,This is actually pretty good.,"I read the book many years ago, so I don't remember the story in great detail. I just know that I liked the book enough to want to see the movie version of it. My general feeling is that books are usually better than movies, but I actually liked Memoirs a lot more than I thought I would. The movie was visually stunning, and I thought the two actresses that played Hatsumomo and Sayuri were beautiful and absolutely mesmorizing in their roles. Gong Li was the perfect villain geisha. She could be ruthless and mean, but you could also see the pain, loneliness and heartbreak in her life, too. I thought the pacing of the movie was a little off at times, but overall, I enjoyed it. The ending was a little abrupt, but I did walk away feeling satisfied that Sayuri was finally able to reveal her true feelings for the Chairman.People who plan to see the movie in order to compare it with the book will be disappointed. It would be better to just enjoy the movie as it is."
3,The end was too abrupt,"I enjoyed the movie throughout except the abrupt ending.Very interesting;I loved how it kept you at the edge of your seat wanting to see what happened next.The acting was so so, but the storyline, costumes, scenery all made up for it.Compelled to read the novel now."
1,Ummm...Did I watch the same movie?,"I have no idea why this movie has received such good reviews. I agree that the score and the visuals are stunning and the cinematography does a wonderful job of providing beautiful shots of the city and the landscape. But this movie could not escape from terrible acting. Characters seemed stiff and awkward (in every way other than the actual performance pieces and dancing), but there was so little emotion displayed on the screen. Some may argue that it's a cultural representation issue, but at the heart of the movie is a love story that never catches hold completely. I wanted more from this adaptation and it was a far cry from a much more successful novel. Read the book and save the two hours to watch something more worthwhile."
1,lovely scenes awful story,Finally saw this one. Glad I didn't bother wasting money buying it.The scenery is really quite good. Very colorful. Wonderful costumage. Girls quite pretty. But all together they do not make up for a bad story with a poor plot and a set of stale unapetizing characters who literally fall flat.This is what you get from a Hollywood where connections matter more than talent. An auful novel whose author clearly has more connections than talent becomes connected to produce a film that basicly wreaks.All I could think while watching this boring tedius and very dull creation is What Is the Point of it All?Hollywood needs a change in its self styled 'Artistic Class'.
1,Beautiful Scenery other than that nada,I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I did see an underlying message of love triumps over even war. But the story was like watching paint dry. The one scene that lived up to the hype was the one where it was remarked that a Geisha can have a man at a simple glance..... other than that. I was disappointed. It was too long. The english was difficult to understand.
3,Lost in Translation,"It is unfortunate to see gifted actors forced to speak a non-native lanaguage which makes them look like B rated actors in a A level movie.Their heavy accent is often incomprehensible. But it isn't just their accent, it is their inability to stress the right vowels at just at the right moment which results in so many of the critical passages passing with little notice.It is apparent the movie should have casted asian american actors for the roles.Although the subject matter is Japanese Geisha and their culture, this movie is a total western creation. The author, producer, and director are all westerners as is most of its crew.This movies lacks that subtle asian understanding of cultural nuances. To the asian eye, this is the movie version of Chow Mein, not authentic to asians, but authentic enough to the westerners.If you want to see a genuine asian movie, watch an asian movie which speaks an asian language."
1,Huh?,This film was long.This film was attractive.This film was boring.This film was egocentric.This film had horrid acting.This film had great cinematography.This film had a horrible screenplay.This film was predictable.This film droned on for hours.This film was hyped.This film was not a good adaption.This film was not the novel.This film had a great make-up artist.This film had a great costume designer.This film had minimal entertainment value.This film couldn't have been adored by Gloria Steinam.This film should be passed over.This film is not worth your time.
1,Dissapointed,"As usual, the book is much better than the movie. No doubt about that. However it would have been great if the geisha had been a japanese actress. The scenarios are great, the houses, dances, etc., everything is very good, but I didn't get the feeling of the real geisha world, as when I read the book."
2,Not a memoir at all.,This film was long.This film was attractive.This film was boring.This film was egocentric.This film had horrid acting.This film had great cinematography.This film had a horrible screenplay.This film was predictable.This film droned on for hours.This film was hyped.This film was not a good adaption.This film was not the novel.This film had a great make-up artist.This film had a great costume designer.This film had minimal entertainment value.This film couldn't have been adored by Gloria Steinam.This film should be passed over.This film is not worth your time.
1,2 1/4 Hours of My Life that I Won't be Getting Back,"Let me be frank. This is not a film that I would recommend to anyone. By sitting through this film I lost two and quarter hours of my life that I won't be getting back!As I have not read the book from which the film is drawn, I can make no criticism of the book. The film, however, is one long bore. I am reminded of ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" which was a truly great book but an absolute shocker of a film. ""Geisha"" is probably in this class.Yes, the sets were magnificent but that comes close to concluding a list of the film's virtues. The characters were weak and the plot paper thin. My recommendation to all potential paying customers is to save your money and look elsewhere."
1,What bad performance,"I enjoyed the book. I looked forward to the movie. But, what a disapointment! ZiYi Zhang is nothing but a zombie with lots of make-up. The acting is terrible! We could even tell she was TRYING to act the character. My husband could not follow the movie, got so bored, and left."
2,I LIKED THIS MOVIE BETTER THE FIRST TIME,"I liked it better the first time when it was called ""Show Girls."" But isn't the original always better?"
1,Another fine crippled product from Sony,"The movie was fine, but on the technical side Sony has taken to crippling their DVD's to prevent people from ripping (legal or otherwise) to their hard drives. This lead to crashes while trying to copy or simply play their DVD's on the PC. I don't make it a habit of pirating movies, but I do enjoy having a digital jukebox of my movies, much like most people do with music. This action by Sony prevents the customer from modifying the content so it can be played back on other devices, so forget about reauthoring it to play back on a PDA, PSP, or simply ripping them onto my laptop so I don't have to bring the DVD's with me when I travel.I need to pay more attention in the future so I can stop giving this anti-consumer company any more of my money."
5,Memoirs of a Geisha,"The movie extras are great. I love this movie and owned regular dvd version, so I wanted to add to my blu ray collection. Condition was great. Thanks so much."
3,Shipping of Geisha,"Memoirs Of A Geisha(Single Disk Version). I love this movie because Ken Wantanabe stars in it and feel its a classic. The delivery time was disappointing. It took way over a week for the item to ship, and then another week before I received it. Although, the price was really good. If I were to order dvds in the future, I may purchase from this company."
3,Why blu-ray ?,"This is a good film with great work of the actors, but the quality of the video is just of an excellent DVD, in Blu-ray it could be better. It seems like a copy of a DVD to a Blu-ray disc. The midia that we have, CD, DVD or Blu-ray are excellents ways to storage audio and/or video, but if the information that is put in them doesn't have quality we won't have what we expect ... The Patriot an the show of Celine Dion, for example, have a great video quality and give us the potential of the Blu-ray !!!"
2,Movie just doesn't cut it,"I absolutely loved the book and had high hopes for the movie, but it's the classic 'the book is better than the movie' scenario. I will say the scenery in the film is beautiful and Ziyi Zhang is a great actress. But I think in order to truly appreciate the story, one should read the book."
1,"Description said the DVD was new and still in the box, it wasn't",The DVD was packaged but somehow the DVD was so scratched and damaged that I couldn't even watch it because my DVD player couldn't read it.
3,"More Info, Less Romance, Please","Beautifully photographed and entertaining, but too long, this movie would have been more interesting if it spent more time on the details of geisha training and less on the gooey romance."
3,What did you expect?,"This is a pretty faithful adaptation of Golden's novel. Indeed it's as contrived and melodramatic as the book. Needless to say, Sayuri is still a whiny Mary Sue and the ending is still as flaccid as it was when I first read the novel years ago.However, I was entertained and the acting was pretty solid throughout. So I would say this was a visually stunning but superficial film. Think Cold Mountain set in Japan."
3,Never read the book...,"I got the movie and watched it, never read the book. I liked it. It was a good story. Just one thing bothered me. This is a spoiler if you've never read the book or seen the movie. SO DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU PLAN ON SEEING THIS. But, she was a little girl (what maybe 8 or 9) and she fell in love with an older guy (basically the only person who was kind to her) in his 30's. I don't know why, but that made me feel a little weird. So the 3 stars are for the other parts of the story that were good, I subtracted 1 star for the weird feeling. Sorry."
3,Book v. Movie,"I loved the look of this movie but it did not live up the richness of the book. I would have loved to see them develop the character of Nobi as they did in the Book. I also missed not seeing the development of Auntie. I was just a little disappointed after reading the book, however, it was still a good movie."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Memoirs of a Geisha uses actors whose English skills preclude authentic performances and a story that moves along a predetermined line (and decides that World War II wasn't important to Japan) towards a conclusion that rings hollow; this movie is gorgeous to look at but nothing more.
5,Surprisingly Good!,"I didn't expect too much going into this film. Frankly, I expected to be bored to death, but I wanted to see what all the hype was about in time for the Oscars. I'm glad to see I was wrong. I'm glad to see the Academy got this one right because this movie is visually stunning, and the story isn't bad either. There are a couple dry spots in it, and I think it was drawn out a lot longer than it should've been, but with that being said. I liked it!"
3,Not sure what the hype was all about,"I am not sure what the hype was about this movie. In the begining it caught my attention and then in the end. Everything in between was just so so. I think that the elements that were in it were done well, but I think there was just to much of one thing. I think that it is still a movie that I would suggest to someone to see once, but I am not going to say this movie was great, it was good."
5,Memoirs of a Geisha,"I have to say I haven't read the book to compare the film against, but I found the film to be both beautiful and intriguing to watch. It is fascinating to see the kinds of situations a Geisha would of put into and how they dealt with it, and the training they underwent. It is also interesting to see the hierarchy in the Geisha world, as well as the distinction between geisha and prostitutes. This film is stunning in it's imagery and direction and the story holds you until the end. My girlfriend has read the book and loved the film also.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,GOOD MOVIE BUT THE BOOK IS WAY BETTER,I'M NOT REALLY UPSET DUE TO HOW MUCH I PAID FOR THE PRODUCT BUT I GOT IT & EVERYTHING LOOKED PERFECT UNTIL I WATCHED IT....HALFWAY THROUGH IT KEPT STALLING & SKIPPING CHAPTERS WHICH I LATER DISCOVERED WAS DUE TO A TINY NICK IN THE DISC....I ALREADY OWN THE MOVIE & JUST WANTED A BETTER COPY OF IT SO I WASN'T REALLY MAD ABOUT IT I'LL JUST REPLACE IT SOME OTHER TIME....IT WOULD'VE BEEN PERFECT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT TINY DEFECT....GREAT MOVIE THOUGH BUT THE BOOK IS WAYYYY BETTER....I'VE READ IT 5 TIMES....THOUGH IT MAY NOT BE AS GREAT AS THE BOOK OR AS ACCURATELY DETAILED IT'S STILL PRETTY GOOD AND AESTHETICALLY PLEASING TO THE EYE
2,A Wonderful Scenery but awfully too long!,"Memoirs of Geisha is 2005 disappointment coming from the director who brought one of the best musicals, Chicago. The direction was at Rob Marshall's all time low. It was choppy and not original. The acting was just so so. Some of the actress' really needed work. The script was crappy. The sets were nice. The timing extremely toooooooo long! I did not like the book either. I thought maybe the movie would maybe be better but I was wrong. So do not watch Memoirs of a showgirl, i mean memoirs of a geisha."
3,review of Memoris of a Geisha,"It's a interesting story,Memoris of a Geisha gives a beautifully descriptive glimpse into what life as a geisha might have been like. From the film,I correct my mistaken views about the true nature of the geisha, I know about how a geisha must be an artist, they are more a comfort, and not a prostiture. The film look at Japanese culture through western eyes, its setting and churns up details of life in a very different society."
3,Something's missing...,"Chiyo is a young girl from a poor family who is sold to a geisha house by her father who is desperate for money to support his ill wife. She is treated cruelly and separated from her sister, and even the dream of being a geisha seems to be taken away from her. Eventually, she comes under the protection and tutelage of an older geisha who trains her and is with her at her debut. Chiyo (now named Sayuri)is pursued by men, but never by the one man she loves. The story from the book is all here, but there is something missing. The cinematography and the tone are decidedly dark and much of the dialogue is difficult to understand. The movie is interesting, but not engrossing. The acting is competent, but not compelling. With a great story and all of the resources at hand, this should have been a better movie."
5,Memoirs of a Geisha,I believe this to be a wonderful movie that I will watch over and over again. A wonderful story with a happy ending. The acting was supurb and the scenery was beautiful.
5,Takes you to another world...,"Life of a Geisha is just that: the life of a young girl forced to become an entertainer of men. Her life becomes a bitter struggle for survival among women who each have their own agenda and their own motivation for the way in which they treat her.Taking place in Japan, around the time of WW2, Life of a Geisha takes you into their world and shows you an insider's view of the geisha and all of the people who interracted with them. Also shown is the different types of artforms the geisha were versed in, including dancing with fans, walking and hand movements."
3,Fairy Tale Geisha,"I finally watched MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, which I skipped when it was out in movie theaters. I read the book a few years ago and enjoyed it immensely. The movie did not impress me. It has some lovely photography, costumes, and scenery. I failed to connect to actress Suzuka Ohgo's portrayal of the Geisha. Mostly, I felt that the film presented a fairy tale version of the Japanese settings. When I read the book, I had a visceral reaction to the characters and locations. The film was simply too perfect. I also questioned whether we were seeing authentic Geisha makeup -- the girls looked awfully ""natural"" in some of the scenes.In any case, the GEISHA movie is not horrible. It simply does not succeed in making that world tangible to the audience. Instead, it presents a fairy tale version of the story when I would have rather had more reality. Plus, the acting of the main roles did not make me emotionally connect to the character's journeys -- a big mistake."
5,"For once, a movie tells almost as much as the book.","I read the book many months before the movie came out and was not disappointed in the movie as I usually am. There were many things in the book that were hard to imagine, such as the Kimono wrapping, that I was constantly saying, ah.. when I saw them on the screen. Of course the movie was not as involved as the book, because that would be impossible due to time constraints, but it adequately presented most of the story and was quite a good representation."
4,Memoirs of a Geisha,"Memoirs of a Geisha is based on a novel set in 1929. A Geisha is telling her life story throughout the movie. The scenery, acting and storyline are great. The movie has a good plot and twists which keep the viewer entertained. One thing which would have made the movie more authentic would have been if the characters had spoken Japanese. Some characters were Chinese which is fine, but the movie would have been good if characters spoke Japanese. They speak English throughout the movie but in the small parts that they speak Japanese, they don't put subtitles.Zhang Ziyi and the lady who plays Mameha are very beautiful. Hatsumomo is a great villain. The whole movie kind of has a depressing feel but it matches what a Geisha's lifestyle would be like. The movie is interesting to watch and I would recommend it."
4,Memoirs of this Movie,"""Memoirs"" is just like reading a book. If you have the time and the patience, watch it and enjoy it. Personally, I think the best thing to do is watch it by yourself on a long, rainy day when you have the time. The cinematography is wonderful and the story is like a soap opera so it keeps your interest. The acting is fantastic as well... but if you only have the desire to see fast moving car chases and bullets piercing flesh, then watch Mission Impossible!!!!! I'm sure the book is better than the actual film. I never read the book, but I did enjoy watching the novel come to life, it's a visual treat, it's like poetry in motion, ya dig?"
2,Why not use Japanese lady actresses?,"I am very disappointed that they made this movie just like most American movie that not really study the real cultures, and honor the couture that they are try to show. First of these entire Chinese lady actresses are not really walk and act like Japanese lady. I am an Asian and I can tell the deferent of Chinese and Japanese lady. There is no way that they are the same. This is just like the movie Anna and the King that can't show and made in Thailand because the story is so far off the true. If you want to see how the Japanese lady is walk, talk, and carry them self watch The Last Samurai, you will see one there. This is very insult to Japanese lady to use all Chinese actresses while there are so many good Japanese actresses to pick from."
2,oh so pretty...vacant,"Very nice to look at - two stars for the cinematography, lighting, and costumes. But the writing is lame and the acting stiff as a board. The female leads especially are horribly miscast. Who thought it was a good idea to get a bunch of Chinese action movie babes and have them do a straight-up sentimental Japanese costume drama - in English? Who thought the highlights in Michelle Yeoh's hair made any kind of sense? And what about that silly Bob Fosse-does-kabuki dance routine? This could have been fine as a Japanese art film with solid Japanese actors and subtitles, but as a dumbed-down US blockbuster attempt it fails miserably. Considering that the Floating World aesthetic was all about subtlety and understatement, perhaps Rob ""Chicago"" Marshall was not the best choice to direct. Where was Kon Ichikawa when they needed him? (still alive and working when this was in production...)"
3,The star is Beebe's photography.,"Marshall is obviously better suited to musicals and just doesn't pull off adequate direction here. But Dion Beebe, who did the low budget but startlingly good-looking Equilibrium, gets to go hog wild with his craft. There are many scenes very reminiscent of Kurosawa's Dreams or Ran, and it's quite fitting. Lastly, I thought the narrative a little quaint, particularly in moving things along. It felt rushed, and that school girl crush being fulfilled in the climax didn't seem like much of a payoff considering the story's flow to that point. Part of my problem with this film, though, is likely that these characters behave more like fully clothed high-class strippers. And being that I live in Vegas, the stripper facade is tiring to me."
2,"dorothy fields might have written: ""lovely to look at, horrific to watch ...""","a coffee table book come to life, ridiculously uninvolving writing and acting; you could turn to any chapter in this pretentious take on mid-20th century japan and not suffer any the worse for it."
2,Pass.....,This film was a disappointment. I was expecting so much more. The relationship between the girl and the director was flat and not believable whatsoever. I give it 2 stars for the gorgeous and sometimes breathtaking visuals.
3,Sooo Very Long,This is a great story. Wont sit and watch it again it's too long. For everything they go through I felt like the ending was cheated...but still a very good story; glad I watched this one.
5,dont let the critics deter you,"If you have read the book, and even if you have not, the visual masterpiece of this movie is worth a rental alone, if not to buy it outright. There are way too many ""literary critics"" dismissing this film, without remembering it is essentially a work of fiction, and so when Rob Marshall created this beautiful visual gem, it wasn't meant to be compared verbatim with the book. Give credit to the gorgeous actors, the choreographors, the musicians, the wardrobers, its not the book, its an extension, and a beautiful extension at that, of the book. Dont always listen to every critical review...see it for yourself, and then judge."
3,Liked the book better,"So, this is a great movie. If I hadn't read the book already I might have given it a five star rating. My problem was, after reading the book I felt there was too much information left out of the movie. I didn't really get that much of a sense of how the characters felt about the situations they were in from the movie. The book explains things so much more adequately. I did think the cast was great and did an excellent job of portraying the book's characters. I Maybe it's because I read more than I watch movies, but this one just felt a little flat to me. It wasn't bad, I just didn't think it was as great as I had heard."
5,A movie that actually follows the book!,I was very impressed with this movie because it actually followed the book although it did leave out a few key parts for times sake. Very good movie if you enjoyed the book. Really clues you in to the life of a Geisha.
5,Memiors of a Geisha Widescreen Edition,"This a 2 disc set that includes the making of the movie as well as the training involved in the actors becoming Geisha. The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and the storyline closely follows the novel. Of course the movie is not nearly as detailed as the novel, but I still appreciated the director's perspective. Even though some of the actors were speaking English phonetically, the emotion was very believable as we get a glimpse of old Japanese culture. This a story of a scared but determined little girl that never gives up her dream to become a better person and acheives that dream as an adult. I highly recommend this movie, it is a truly romantic love story."
4,Las runas de las brujas,"Siento no hablar inglés, pero afortunadamente tenemos traductores que nos ayudan. Lo mismo me pasa con el libro poco a poco lo iré traduciendo pero he de decir que con el poco inglés que hablo tengo una muy buena impresión del libro, es el más completo que he encontrado, así que estoy muy contenta. Gracias!"
5,An sweet '80s classic!,"When Neil Finn put his mind to making terrific music, he really hits the mark. This disc comprises some of his best ever--the danceable bop of ""Now We're Getting Somewhere"" and ""Something So Strong,"" the heartaching melodies of ""Don't Dream it's Over"" (the ambiguity alone just slays me). Sure, this disc lacks the edgy lyrics that brother Tim provided in the Split Enz and reprised on Woodface, but sometimes all you need is a sweet song to get you through the day."
5,"I tell ya, it changed my life...","I owe my 12-year (and still counting!) obssession with Crowded House/Neil Finn to this album! The first ""Crowded House"" I bought was a cassette, and it was the only thing I would listen to for months on end. I was only ten, too! I'm much older now, of course, and I adore this album even more than ever. ""Don't Dream It's Over""--pure genius, it still brings tears to my eyes time and again. ""World Where You Live,"" ""Hole in the River,"" ""Something So Strong,"" and everything else--gems, all of them. The passing of time is definitely proving this album to be a classic and Crowded House to be one of the greatest pop bands to walk the face of the earth (though I knew that already!)."
4,80's Pop Gem,"Crowded House was a 3 piece band from Australia led by Neil Finn who was a former member of the band Split Endz (along with his brother Tim). Crowded House got quite big in America back in the late 80's with their blend of strong song writing and harmony vocals. This is the only Crowded House album that I own, but I have always really liked it. Two huge hits came from this album ""Don't Dream It's Over"" and ""Something So Strong"" both of which are great pop tunes. Other highlights include ""Mean To Me"", ""World Where You Live"", and the haunting ""Hole In The River"". If you are looking for very well done pop this album is for you."
2,"Great music, lousy DVD-Audio remix","(Music=4, Sound=1) Out of the twenty or so DVD-Audio and SACD discs I've listened to so far, this is by far the worst. In fact, this Crowded House DVD-Audio is the only disappointment I've had with these new high-resolution formats. Main reason: WAY too bass heavy! Boomy, overwhelming bass - like the kind that comes from a teenager's car where the entire trunk is a subwoofer. This is the type of bass that would be appropriate for Public Enemy's or the Beastie Boys' DVD-A/SACD reissues, not for a pop rock band like Crowded House! If there is justice, this Crowded House DVD-Audio disc will either go out of print and be re-released with a corrected mix, or Capitol should reduce the price to US$9.99, because that's all it's worth (definitely not worth the US$24.99 I paid!)."
2,UNFINISHED ORDER,"I CANNOT OFFER A REAL REVIEW FOR THIS SET .I HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE LATE AUGUST FOR THE REST OF MY SET. I HAVE ONLY RECEIVED ONE PIECE. AMAZON HAS ASSURED ME THEY WILL CORRECT THIS, BUT AT THE PRICE I PAID IF I CANNOT RECEIVE THE REST SOON, I WILL REQUEST A REFUND. IT WOULD BE A GREAT ITEM AT A MUCH LOWER PRICE, BECAUSE THE QUALITY IS GOOD.."
4,great item,"Love the shoe, Love the look, but only thing I have an issue with is it's width. The shoe is very narrow....otherwise a wonderful shoe...love it"
3,A Matter of Taste (yours or mine?),"The piano effects are fine, and Steven Halpern is a master with this instrument. Some themes are heavily ""Christian"", or at least influenced by the faith, so this CD may be recommended for those who lean heavily on their faith to find peace. Conversely, those who tend to look for peace in other ways may tend to shy away from this music. I find the rather 'weighty' (or is it 'deep'?) rendition of Amazing Grace to be a tad overdone. Besides, if it is Amazing Grace, why call it something else? I hope it is not with the intent to deceive the listening public."
4,Blu Ray is Directors Cut,"I haven't watched Playing God, but I did watch, The Color of Night. I owned the previous Directors Cut, and it appears to have the same content. This is the extended version. A previous reviewer stated that on cable showings, there is more to be seen. Since, I've never seen it on cable, I cannot comment on that, but if you are looking for the previously released Director's Cut, it's here. The video content is improved over the DVD. It's a pretty clean print and I did not find anything wrong with the video. It's not as pristine as a newer release, it looks more like an upconverted DVD, but I'm sure it's the best it's ever looked. Audio was average...nothing to write home about.For the price you really can't go wrong. If you are on the fence, I'd say go ahead and buy."
3,Video quality of Color of Night is poor,"Video quality of Color of Night is poor. It is very grainy, which is very odd, and probably is the result of misoperation of the equipment used to convert from film to digital format. Additionally, the scene with Jane March and Bruce Willis in the pool is tamer than either of the two different versions that I've seen on cable. Although, it is the same as the Director's Cut that was released on regular DVD, and the quality is much, much better, owing mainly to the fact that that DVD release was so poorly done as to be barely watchable."
3,GOOD QUALITY ACCEPTABLE MOVIES,"These are two not particular successful moves but both are interesting and original. Color of the Night is not the ""R"" version not the ""UNRATED"" one; it is something in between. The movie has a decent but sometimes difficult to believe script Playing God is interesting with not fully developed story; it could have been a classic but never gets deeper into characters and motivations."
4,Color of Night is Very Erotic Movie,I consider Color of Night a very interesting drama mystery with a considerable amount of sexual situations. I remember when it was released that Bruce Willis strongly fought to keep male frontal nudity from being cut from the movie. He won.
5,bought this for the color of night (Bruce Willis fan),"Color of night is a great movie if your a Bruce Willis fan, was happy to see it out on blu-ray finally!"
3,Sound lets it down,"Unfortunately neither of these films are in 5.1, which spoils the experience somewhat. Otherwise the picture is sharp and clear, the colour depth quite nice."
5,Logic Book,The delivery was quick and the book what was exactly what I needed. It was in great condition and I could't have asked for a better deal
3,pretty cool,"this book is not quite what i expected it to be but it's like a complete script of the very first simpsons episode called ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire."" Even though it's wasn't what i expected it to be, i liked it."
1,What a awful book,"I have read many books by Rebecca Brandewyne and I could not believe that she wrote this. Her heroes are often volatile, and passionate but they are never cruel or abusive. The hero in this book, Rian, is an abusive vicious man with a cruel streak a mile wide. He raped the heroine repeatedly and slapped her around when he was angry with her. He slapped her hard enough one time that she had a bruise on the side of her face. He never felt any remorse for how he treated her. There was one time when he slapped her three times, raped her, and told her that if that she fought him he would break her arm. The heroine, Morgana, needed to be in a battered wife's shelter, not in this marriage."
3,Very Violent,"I gave this book three stars because it was a very good,exciting story. However, there was a lot of violence. There were numerous incidents of marital rape that the sensitive reader might find repulsive,and the hero did slap the heroine many times. Normally, this would repulse me but you have to read the whole story to understand the violent context. The love between the hero and heroine was very real and touching. Before judging the story on the title, I recommend that you read the book and make the decision on your own."
1,Not worth the time,"This book has the sorriest story line ever! Sorry to spoil the story for people who haven't read this book. So, basically, the Hero uses and abuses the Heroine. They get married, Then a frenchman came along and ""killed"" her husband then she slept with that guy!( Her husband is not dead). She found out the husband is not dead, try to break up with the frenchman, he didn't want to , so they killed him. She then goes off to travel around the world with the husband. She got lost and was travelling by herself. While she was travelling, she was basically whoring herself! Sleeping with hot guys, but would not have sex with a White fat man, African man, and Chinese man. Then at the end comes back to the man who abuses her and realize she then ""Loves "" him. Waste of time!"
1,seriously???????,"i read this book after reading reviews on amazon seriously???? is all i have to say and though the hero is abusive he is the only one endearing throughout the book because he remains consistent in loving the heroine and in that era his abuse was perfectly acceptable however, the heroine on the other hand was mean flighty and slept with anyone that she fancied not keeping at all with the period the author obviously has talent in writing but she seriously lost the plot in this one!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,What a disappointment!,"The best thing about this book is the three-ring format. I can throw away the pages, and insert my own recipes. There aren't many recipes, and those are absolutely mundane. I didn't need recipes for macaroni and cheese or meatloaf. Worse yet, this book contains mostly high-fat, high-carbohydrate dishes. And dishes that are normally stir-fried are simmered in a CROCKPOT! For new cooks, I'd recommend ""Joy of Cooking"" or ""Betty Crocker"" - a much better value. For experienced cooks, there is nothing new in this book. A complete loss"
5,Awesome product,Easy to open & close; easy on the eyes; not as opaque as other colored clamshells so easy to read label on CD/DVD inside; the rack is a BIG bonus!!!
1,"good price, poor quality","Don't let the price fool you. I purchased these a few weeks ago. They arrived with the box smashed in. The clamshells themselves don't close completely, or tightly. This causes your media to fall out and become damaged from hitting the ground. What irritates me more is the fact that shipping was several dollars more than the product itself. No way shipping, that took 10 days to arrive to my home (via USPS), and weighed only 1lbs, if that, cost 7+ dollars to be shipped. I think cyberguys is overcharging and pocketing the unused shipping funds to offset the cost of their cheaply priced, cheaply made product. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM."
5,Exceeding Expectations,"I found these clam-shell CD covers to be very effective. The different colors help keep things organized, the rack with the CDs/DVDs take less room than the Jewel boxes, AND they are more durable. The only drawback is the inability to include the square format CD/DVD jackets, but I consider that a minor loss as compared to the win-win-win of easy organization by rack and color code, space savings, and greater durability. I'll be buying more of these!"
3,"Some good stuff, but...","There's some great tracks on this record, no question. ""Baby Goes To 11"" is a fantastic opening track, but the album takes a bit of a dive until ""Extra Sensory"". ""Remain Your Strange"" is a classic and ""Drag Me Closer To You"" closes the recording on an up note. But too much filler bogs the effort down."
4,Another solid 12 from one of the hardest working rock bands,"Superdrag is back with Last Call For Vitriol, their fourth full-length and second on indie label Arena Rock Recording Company. Like the other three, this is a solid Superdrag release, with expertly crafted songs full of great riffs, harmonies, and lyrics. Standouts include the simply worded, yet from-the-heart Baby Goes to 11, the honest Extra-Sensory, and the hard rocking Staggering Genius. For the first time, bassist Sam Powers writes two songs, one of which, Remain Yer Strange, is pure rock n roll goodness. The only two songs I didn't care for on Vitriol are Way Down Here Without You and Safe & Warm, slower almost country-esque numbers. They're played well and I understand the band trying to broaden its scope, but they just didn't work for me. Overall, another great entry in the Superdrag catalog. Can't wait to see these guys live."
1,Bland as Bland Gets,"Superdrag sounds like every other ""progressive"" rock band on the radio today: Blink 182, Weezer, Lit, (fill in the blank).In a word, bland. They all have that same tight, metallic guitar sound -- clean and non-threatening, just like their music. Do these bands all use the same producer or what? Yawn.I'll take a real rock and roll band (yes, there's a difference between ""rock"" and ""rock and roll"") like the White Stripes, Sleater-Kinney, the Hives, the Strokes and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Down and dirty, the way rock and roll is supposed to be."
5,Best yet.,"The best Superdrag CD yet. The variety of genres, the tight craftmanship, the sheer pop joy of it . All these qualities make this the best Superdrag CD to date.At first I liked the second half of the CD better but the first side really has caught my attention as well.Buy this CD, you will listen to it over and over again and find something new each time."
5,SUPERDRAG DOES IT AGAIN,"Once more superdrag puts out an excellant album. This album is possibly my favorite by "" the drag"" and is not too much diffrent from the others. However, this album has no grey area. Either the songs are heavely guitar driven, or soft and acoustic. This is a good thing concerning the song list. The heavy and acoustic songs are spread quite evenly throughout the album making it enjoyable to listen to from "" baby goes to eleven"" until ""drag me closer to you"". Although the heavier songs out number the softer songs it is still an evenly laid out album. John Davis does an incredible job as usuall on the song's lyrics and format. This album also features Sam Powers on lead vocals on a few songs which is nice. Overall, this album is well worth the money and well worth the time and effort to listen to it. Plus, its superdrag-this album is incredible."
5,Very Useful with Terms and Definitions,"This book has all the shooting terms and definitions related to firearms. Some of the definitions have photos. The nomenclature is very clear and easy to understand when you have the definitions. Just like a standard dictionary the words and or terms are listed from A - Z, with the definition listed below the word(s).Examples of persons who might find this book very helpful; Firearm Examiners, Gun Writers, Armorers, Completive Shooters, Reloaders, Thinkers, Collectors, Gun Builders, Gunsmiths and or anyone who wants to use the proper terms and vocabulary with Firearms.This book and books of this type:Firearms Encyclopedia by George C. Nonte Jr.Small Arms Lexicon and concise Encyclopedia by Chester Muller and John OlsonThe Firearms Dictionary by R.A. SteinderI have all three and find them very useful, along with the Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners, Glossary of terms."
4,Turnquist Remedy,"Produced by Barry Kane and Al Schmitt, this album was recorded in Hollywood. Michael Woods wrote all their material except Last Cigarette co-written with Dennis Hudson and Douglas Benson and an excellent cover of Richard Farina's Reno, Nevada.Although some dealers try to give this album a psychedelic tag, in fact only the cover art (with an inner sleeve) and the song All Gone Blues Act II are worthy of it, the other tracks being faithful to the specific sound of Pentagram, a short lived label founded by Al Schmitt, the former producer of the Jefferson Airplane, which specialized in West Coast acts with fluid guitar and vocal harmonies (Redeye, Rex Holman, Red, Wilder, Blue).John Maggi later played with String Cheese."
4,great paperdoll book,I waited for this book and was excited when it came. m It has a varied mix mof paperdoll artists work. It looks pretty used on outside but pages are in good shape.
4,A comic book that is fun.,"This series, compared to the other vertigo series, does exactly what it should do as a comic book. It's completely unpretentious, an asset that is often forgotten in modern day comics books. That is it's main appeal. It's there simply to enjoy. It is happily immoral, generally silly, but oh so much fun. I like this the same way I like Pulp Fiction or Kick-Ass (the comic). There is no point in me delving into the plot. If you have enjoyed the series so far, you will enjoy this. If you didn't enjoy it so far, you won't. If you are interested in it, buy the first graphic novel,see if you like it, and continue on from there."
5,preacher makes me bow,"This entire series is incredible. the story is very addictive, funny, and full of wtf?!? moments straight away. the art is graphic, punchy, and beautifully detailed. This talented pairing of intelligent and interesting writing with the more than fantastic visual artistry makes for one of the greatest stories to be told. This is not for the faint of heart, people! It can be pretty brutal and mind blowing at times for those sheltered and p.g. loving types of personalities. This is for people that may be a little twisted, but don't be afraid...Reverend Jesse will take care of you."
3,"5 stars for content, 2 for paper quality","I love Preacher and have no complaints with the content of the book, but I have a complaint about the paper quality of this volume.My complaint is that this volume is, for some reason, printed on a noticeably cheaper grade of paper than the other volumes I have, which were printed on the nice glossy paper that all comics should be printed on. A few other Vertigo trade paperbacks I've ordered online recently have use this same grade of paper, is this some kind of cost-cutting measure that they've recently introduced? If the prices of the books were lowered accordingly, I wouldn't mind so much, but it's a little irritating to pay the same price as the volumes that have nice glossy paper and instead get the cheap phonebook-like paper.I posted a question about this on the Vertigo message boards a couple of weeks ago, but I never got a response."
1,Great scene-setter for what is yet to come.,"This was a long awaited book for me and it did not disappoint! It provides key background information on Jesse's father and Cassidy's early days. Although, being Irish, I found the references to the Easter Rising a little simple, the origins of Cassidy really provided an excellent setting for him. A topnotch novel, well worth the money (especially if you get it from amazon. Simply the best character to hit the shelves since Gaiman's Sandman series."
5,An Awesome Book,"The book Show and Tell by author Karen Vanderlaan is an incredible autobiography of the author's life. As you read this book you will find that the author has been transparent about her life of being abused and manipulated by the people in her life that should have been a role model for her. Being transparent is not easy as you must relive the painful past in order too not only help others, but to find healing for yourself. Show and Tell is a book that will have you mad at the abuse, frustrated by the others who witnessed everything but did not take action, and at the same time will warm your heart as Karen Vanderlaan turns her scars into stars. Show and Tell is a fabulous book, written by an extraordinary person that will have you turning the pages of the book to see what happens next. This book is a must read and will definitely encourage and strength the reader.Tom Ward"
4,Intimate Knowledge,"Karen has let you in to her deepest secrets. She has shown you how life can promise you something and deliver its opposite. However, she also shows the power of the spirit, the strength of love, the control of a woman who knows what is important.Let Karen share her life with you and allow you believe - love conquers all."
5,Healthy Oatmeal,I ordered this product for the first time on Amazon and I am pleased with the flavor as well as the convenience of having the protions in packets. I'll buy more when I run out. Excellent price too!
3,useful for DJ's/producers/turntablists and MC's,"I've heard better instrumentals and beats but this was probaly good at the time it came out compared to what is out now that is way better... but i found it useful for dj-ing and beat juggling. the instrumentals aren't that long for an MC to flow too, but if you keep repeating and looping them, you could flow to them.I picked it up solely cause i'm a collector of the Blood & Crip (Dangerous Records) stuff. It is a rare cd, but don't buy it for more then $20"
5,Great performance artist & singer,"I bought this album on a whim from a local Russian video store for $5. I never heard of her before but after listening to it I got hooked. Her videos are brilliant (see youtube under ""Linda russian""). She has a bit of a goth and experimental side and after seeing her live videos, I bought a live DVD. She is very unique & whimsical. Originally from Kazakhstan, she adds elements of her unique culture & imagery. Very cool stuff!"
3,"""Magic"" is ""Science"" disguised in this book - refreshing!","In the rush to save their city, their way of life and their very lives, ""Natural Philosophers"" attempt to invent, build and test a means to defend themselves using what we would recognize as a crude grenade launcher powered by gunpowder.But the story does not focus on who has the biggest and best magic - it focuses instead on the various ways and ethics involved in surviving in a world where might makes right - and are ""we"" right enough to use our ""might""?And the consequences afterward."
3,Variation in quality,"This is three books together - A Dirge for Sabis, Wizard Spawn, and Reap the Whirlwind.The first book - Dirge - I was not impressed by. It was readable, but there were places where it was (in my opinion) redundant, and the villains had the annoying tendency of one-dimensional rot. 3 stars.The second book - Wizard Spawn - is better. There isn't much on an epic scale, instead it focuses on a close-knit group of characters in the midst of a nation about to fall into anarchy. 3.5 stars.The third book - Whirlwind - is the best of the three, and has Mercedes Lackey style written all over it. Not one of her really good books, but if you like her stuff, you'll probably be satisfied with this book. 3.8 stars."
1,"Good blade, but poor design and FRAGILE","I have a Kyocera ceramic chef's knife that I have been using for about 7 years as my primary kitchen knife and I've never had to sharpen it. It is almost as sharp now as the day I bought it. Needless to say, I love that knife. About two months ago, I found myself in need of a new peeler, and given my fondness for the Kyocera knife, decided to give this ceramic peeler a try. Sadly, it really is not the same class of utensil.I use the peeler primarily for zesting citrus fruits for use in cocktails, and the ceramic blade handled that job reasonably well. The plastic channel zesters on either side of the blade (for making, say, a lemon twist) are basically worthless. I already had an OXO tool for that purpose, so no worries. But yesterday, after maybe 10 uses in 2 months, the plastic frame that holds the blade snapped into three pieces, rendering the whole thing useless. I'll be replacing it with the OXO Y-Peeler."
5,great addition to kitchen,this is a great addition to anyone who has it all in the kitchen. The ceramic blades are really amazing. try the knives!!!
2,"Great to use, but not durable","The blade's nice and sharp, great-shaped handle, corers are a nice touch, but mine came apart and was unusable after just a few months of light duty at my house. Looks good, but the quality is quite poor."
5,Fantastic - One of the BEST in its league!,"A LOT of familiarity in this book...with self-knowledge and also identification with Phil's situation here. I'll defiinitely contact the author to learn more about how I might be able to participate in past-life regression and also the Guides channeled info. as to coming Earth shift knowledge that is becoming more known daily...so it was very excellent as to relevance and helping us realize the GIFT that our ""extraterrestrial Guides/Friends"" are for us as we ride Spaceship Earth."
5,Believe it or not.,"Very interesting and logical to me, but hard to believe. I going to read read more of her books. Just ordered 9 of them. I recommend this book."
1,LOOK INSIDE the book on Amazon BEFORE buying,"My only advise to you, if you are considering buying this book, is to LOOK INSIDE on Amazon.com, before buying it. For some reason, I did not do what I usually do, bought this book and did not like it.My impression of this book is that it cannot be considered a serious work on neither the subject of UFO, past life regression or hypnotherapy. Also, I couldn't stay interested, even when I tried to read it as fiction and entertainment.I can only repeat ""LOOK INSIDE on Amazon.com, before buying this book."" If you like what you see in the samples, then buy it and draw your own conclusions."
3,Should Read This One First,"I read Convoluted Universe and the Custodians before I read this book. It's a very early publication and is not worth reading unless it's read first. The other books outstrip the concepts presented in this little handbook by a long shot. If you are just waking up and beginning to research concepts beyond the world's mass TV view, this is the book for you. You'll be happy reading and digesting it as a first try. If you are already awake, well read and researched in science and the concepts of ETs, it is not. In that case, buy the Custodians, then Book 1 of Convoluted Universe. This book will be too slow for you."
4,Every Dog Has His Day,"Let me give an honest review, with no bias whatsoever. First off I am not black, I am Mexican. Been listening to G-Funk for 10 years and this my review: the album gets a 4/5 for production and the lyrics get a 3.5/5. This was an improvement compared to the first release, especially for the Crips. My group of preference was the Crips, they simply had better delivery. ""Eastside Rip Rider"", ""Every Dog Has His Day"" and ""Crip for Life"" are stand out tracks, with superior rapping and production. ""G's and Loc's"" was catchy, rhythmic and overall great. The rappers that stand out the most is Troll Loc, Cixx Pacc, Big Freeze and Lil Hawk from the Bloods.Songs worth listening to:2 G's and Loc's5 Mafia Lane7 Can't Stop, Won't Stop10 East Side Rip Rider14 Every Dog Has His Day15 Crip 4 Life"
4,"C-Side Rhida, locC!","You gotta give it up 4 the Crips on this track, man! Peace to the Rollin' 60's & Nutty Blocc Crips, even though the Crip gangs may have rappers that give us C's a bad name like Snoop Doggy Doggy Dogg & Tha Mutt Pound, the Crips still have good rap artists such as Eazy-E, B.G. Knocc Out & Dre'sta, MC Eiht, CMW, CJ Mac, Lil' C-Style, MC Ren, Ice Cube, WC, Lil' Eazy, Coolio, Da Lynch Mob, Above The Law, Kokane, Scarface, The Geto Boys, C-Bo, Lil' 1/2 Dead, Swoop G & many other rappers. Peace to DJ Quik, 2pac, Outlawz, Hi-C, Mausberg, The Game, AMG, Mack 10, AllFrumTha-I & Cypress Hill who were members of the M.O.B. Piru Bloods. Still have to give it up 4 my C-walking homies, Crips-4-Life!Banging On Wax 2: Saga Continues best hits are G's & Locs, East Side Rip Rider, Slob 187 & Slobs Keep On Slippin', also muthaphukk the Damu Rhidaz aswell!"
1,Typical Mud Ignorance At Its Finest,"This album is about as creative as a 4 year old's Play-dough sculpture of the statue of David. A shining example of how ignorant today's youth is, this album is full of violence, profanity, and simple thought, much of which is marketed towards the ever-growing crowd of white teenagers with short blonde hair, white t-shirts, who say ""fo shizzle"" to try and fit in with their pant-sagging mud counterparts. If they really wanted to kill each other, why are they making albums? Answer: because they know there's a gullible audience of people who would pay 10 bucks for this rhetorical crap."
4,Good for the money,"Product is as advertised. Have not had any problems with the battery life thus far. I'm not an expert on shipping requirements, but I did find it odd that it was just shipped in one of the USPS flat rate envelopes though (thought batteries had more stringent shipping requirements than that). Would buy from this seller again though."
1,Does not fit the notebook and does not hold a charge!,"This battery was poorly engineered and gets lodged in the notebook...requiring prying to remove. As a result my notebook case was slightly damaged as was the battery case. I wonder if they'll return my money? Moreover, it just plain doesn't hold a charge. What a big waste of time!"
1,DOES.... NOT... WORK!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.,Well i guess you get what you pay for. Wish I could give this negative 5 stars. Worst battery ever. Plugged in and seemed to be charging perfectly fine. Reached 100% which was when i unplugged the charger... yes.... THE LAPTOP SHUT OFF! Don't bother wasting money on this pathetic battery. Save the money and go treat yourself at a fancy restaurant instead.
1,"Disappointing, Broken","Ordered this to be delivered at where I was staying for the holidays. Charged it up, everything seemed good, got rid of the packaging, and headed home. Couldn't use it. It fails within ~15 seconds from a cold boot, or the instant you do anything other than idle, if you just unplug the laptop. Totally useless, but I'm stuck with it. Avoid this product!"
2,Disappointing,"When I purchased my new HP Pavillion dv2000 laptop 2 years ago, I spent the money for the extended life battery. I only occasionally used it, in airports etc, but it was nice to have.While it lasted.2 years later, I had the battery assessed through the HP site, and found that it is shot. I have been unable to use it for more than 6 months, not really sure when I noticed it wasn't lasting as long as advertised, but pretty sure that wasn't long after I got the computer.I'm replacing it, but not through HP, as they charge astronomical prices for it, but as I am considering selling the computer to upgrade, I feel it would only be right to have a functioning battery with it.Very disappointed, and I will never spend the money on an HP extended life battery again."
1,Northparts ripped me off,First laptop battery lasted 4 months. I paid to ship the bad battery back. Second battery lasted 3 months. Northparts said to ship it back. I paid another $11 dollars to ship it back. They then quit responding to me. After about 4 weeks and 6 e-mails I decided to see if I could buy a battery from them. They responded in 10 minutes. I asked them when they were going to send me the replacement battery. They said they did not support Amazon orders anymore. I called Amazon and they could not help. Beware of Northparts
4,Good fishing tool,"Good tool to have for fishing but is slightly heavy. Have a Boga Grip and like it better but for the price, this one is nice."
1,"Glue, Glue, and Pissed","I was excited to receive this piece of equipment but once I opened the package it didn't work properly. The pincers worked but the weighing apparatus didn't move. I ended up having to dismantle the entire thing using a pipe wrench to remove the inner barrel and then scrapping off an over abundance of glue. It was everywhere. I ended up having to cut the foam handle. It now works but the handle is all jacked up and it will be uncertified now. If it wasn't such a pain in the butt, I would have returned it. Don't buy this kind of equipment from this company, although they make a great lure."
5,"Fly, Dream, Be...",The silence say it all. The poets speak through the silence. Just don't miss this album.
2,Item Shown is not what I got.,"In the picture, it shows a sword stand that sets up on a shelf. This is what I ordered. The stand that I recieved only hangs on a wall. That is not what I expected. I could have sent it back but rather chose to just find a place to hang it. Not happy with this whole process but I will deal with it."
2,"Great product, but what a hassle...","Similac is a great option to breast feeding, but with the liquid form you have to keep it on ice or refridgerated. Not a great option for a new mom on the move! The powder form has become more practical for us this time around..."
1,Healthy Gluten-Free Cooking,"Absolutely worthless. I've tried several recipes in this book and they are so confusing. The ingredients will be measured in cups, but the directions will say pints. So which is it? Cups or Pints? The dry ingredients are measured in cups and in parenthesis it will be ounces, but the ounces aren't the equivalent of the cups. I really wish they would have made up their minds before putting this book together."
1,Revised review: this watch is garbage,"A fine looking, elegant, ""sporty"" watch, very light and comfortable. My only complaint is the sub-dials - the numbers/letters are so tiny as to be just about useless, especially the date dial, with 31 numbers crowded in. That said, though - I like it a lot, and I wear it a lot. My recommendation: check out any watch ""live and in person"" before you buy it online.Revised May '09: I stopped wearing this watch a year ago, and I finally got around to throwing it away. The screw-down cap stopped screwing down, and moisture got into the watch dial in humid weather. This watch, and my other Skagen, are both deep-sixed. I'll never buy Skagen again. I now have two Bulovas, one sport and one dress, and they're both excellent."
3,not like the picture,"I will be returning this watch - even though it seems nice - light, good looking and good fit. I want it to look like it does in the picture.I don't like that the small hands on the little dials are red, as is the tip of the second hand.Also - just an FYI - it has a screw down crown, so make sure you unscrew it before you try to set the time or you might break a nail. I didn't really read the instructions, but when I gave them a scan, I didn't see a reference to that."
4,Not bad,"The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the black rubber band. I'm not a big fan of it, but other than that, for the price, it is a great watch. Nice looking bezel (although no illuminating hands) with a pretty solid build. Great buy for the price."
4,Skagen Men's Titanium Watch #390LTMRB,"All in all, a very nice watch. My third Skagen, and it won't be my last. My only surprise is in the size of the watch; my impression was that it was a bit smaller, that the face area was smaller."
1,Water Leakage,"I really liked the look of the watch, but after one trip to the pool water started to seep inside the watch and a small layer of condensation started to form underneath the glass. Each time I use the watch it gets worse. This one is going back to my buddies at Amazon...Good looking watch and from what I understand, a great brand, but poorly made."
1,Too bad...,"The box the watch came in was very difficult to open. The packing was made up of nested cubes. I had to insert the end of a wooden spoon through the opening of the outer cube to push out the inner cube. Ugh. I put the watch on to try it out and it fit fairly comfortably, it would have fit better if I had thicker wrists, I think, but I liked its size and looks. Next I tried to pull out the crown to set the time and date. It wouldn't budge.I have since returned the watch."
4,Bay Area Boyz,"When I first bought this CD I was unaware that there were two songs (""You"" & ""Happy Feelin's"") not on this CD. Why those songs were taken out, I don't know. But I do know that those were two of the best songs from the original album. Only when I looked closer on the back of the CD did I see the message 'abridged version of the album'. I think this is deceiving and both of those songs should of been included from the original album. However, these two songs were put on there ""Live in LA"" CD. The song ""Golden Time of Day is one song I wished they had recorded live on this CD. Oh well!"
1,Maze Live in New Orleans,The 2 favorite songs i really like - SKIP all the way through. i cannot play this on my new Alpine system. wasted $$$$
4,Live in New Orleans,"I love this CD, BUT there is one song missing . The 8 tract tape includes the song ""YOU"" as the first title."
5,Outstanding,I remember it from the first time I woke up and heard them play at 3am live and this isn't my first copy I have cassette; vinal now a dvd
3,Please re-release.....,"Please re-release this cd unabridged.....I just heard the song ""you"" and nearly lost my mind because it sounded so good. I'm hoping in the very near future I can obtain this cd in it's original format as it would be worth every penny."
1,Dont buy this CD,This CD is low resolution I have the original vinyl album and the sound is a thousand times better. Too bad the original is fantastic. John would be furious.
5,THE BEST J. LennonCD/CD EVER,"This is the BEST cd i've ever heard. Yes OVER-ALL some of the tracks are - sub par. but Jealous Guy, How Do You Sleep, and IMAGINE make up for ANY and all losses! Buy this album! IT BELONGS in ANY ""Music conniseurs"" collection!"
2,Try to imagine John Lennon with no possessions...,"A truly over-rated album, compiled by one of the greatest hypocrites of the 1960s. Try as I might, I cannot imagine John Lennon without possessions.His estate was estimated at $500 million when he died...Why didn't you show us the way, John, by divesting yourself and giving away your vast fortune? The rest of the songs are forgettable, and mediocre. Take a pass on this album and buy a Beatles' CD."
4,"Very cute, but there are some better ones out there","I like the book, and am grateful for the sturdy construction, the nice illustrations, and the interactivity. But I've seen better Opposites books out there, like the one by Robert Crowther. To be fair, this book was published a long time ago compared to the better books."
4,Cute & Sturdy,I bought a couple of these books and liked this one best. This one has cute pictures to learn from and they both seem very sturdy. They should hold up pretty well against my one and a half year old nephew. :)
4,Recipe for fun,"This sweet 31-page picture book includes the Hanukkah blessings and songs, four illustrated pages on the story of Hanukkah and instructions for the traditional Hanukkah Dreidel game.It also offers parents activities for each of the holiday's eight nights. Instructions tell how to make a menorah (Hanukkiah), Hanukkah greeting cards, a gelt holder (for Hanukkah money), a Mogen David (Star of David) and a Judah Maccabee shield.This book also includes a recipe for latkes --- along with the overall recipe for Hanukkah fun.--- Alyssa A. Lappen"
5,A Must For Every Jewish Child!,"This wonderful storybook and activity book in one covers the eight nights of Hanukkah and is with activities, stories and songs. It is a must for every young Jewish child!It contains a story of the saga of Hanukkah: The struggle of the Jewish Patriots (Maccabbees) against the Greco-Syrian occupiers in the Land of Israel, and the miracle of the oil, which burned for eight nights.It gives details of how to light the Hanukkah candles, and the special prayer which we say when we light them, the Dreidel game, the tradition of the giving of Gelt over Hanukkah and how Hanukkah fits into the Hebrew Calendar, as well as lots of activities to keep the children busy over the eight days.A wonderful little book!"
4,nice...but....,"The table is lovely and easy to assemble, however the color is not quite how it is represented in the photo. It is a dull brown walnut. The photo gives it a more robust red color. I do like the table..just wish the color was more like the photo."
1,Great look - Terrible wear and function.,"We installed 6 of these in the white finish, INSIDE a beach house. All of the blades have begun rusting, throwing rust spots along the walls at blade height. There are no alternative blades available for this fan. Also, not only is the motor loud at high speed, the air pushed by the blades is minimal. I love the look; extremely disappointed by the function"
5,Worth every penny...,"I've always been very judgmental when it comes to listening and buying purely instrumental music, but Tabla Beat changed all that. Not only are the beats incredible, but the music from the tabla can't help but influence me! I would strongly recommend this whole collection for anyone with a musical ear!"
2,Big and boring,"I like Laswell a lot, but I just can't get into this album. Every song sounds the same. The musicians play well, but nothing sticks in the brain. Once it's over, I've forgotten the whole thing. I listen to it from time to time, but it's just background music."
5,Painless Transaction!!!,"The description is pretty straightforward for this product. The cases themselves are durable but I have never tried to go out of my way to break one intentionally. What I do know is that Best Buy has has a small set of clear cases (50) for about the same price (if you can find a clerk to get them out of the back) and that Office Max's case packs (50) are usually broken and useless. Of the 400 (2 orders) we had shipped to us, there was one broken case. The package was double-boxed and arrived before the promised date. Great job, LinkyoExpress! Will order again!"
3,Some were broken...,"This shipped in and I immediately started using the cases for a project I was finishing up. I was disappointed that of the 100 I used, there were about 15 broken cases. Most of these had broken hinges due to shipping, I suppose. The ones that weren't broken are solid cases, but it is still frustrating to have to throw so many away. You can take your chances, and these cases are really well priced, but I'd say the way they are packaged, there is a good chance that you'll have a fair number of broken cases right off the bat."
3,Vact 5.2 mm Slim CD & DVD Jewel Cases 200-pack,"I must complement Musician's Friend, for all there help. The CD cases arrived with 1/3 broken. Musician's Friend sent me new ones to replace the broken ones. I was impressed with the service I received."
2,Not pleased with the quality.,"I have to admit the price was good, however, the quality was not. The cases do not lay flat, they have a dished shape probably due to the way they're packaged. They don't stay closed very well and upwards of 20 or more out of 200 were damaged and unusable when they arrived. I don't think I'll buy these again."
5,They do what they should!,"You can't really screw up jewel cases. These are your traditional cases; not name-brand or anything, but the value is fantastic. Even with standard shipping, I got mine the very next day. No packaging other than the box they come in--that means you need to keep the original shipment, but not really a big deal. They get the job done."
1,You get what you pay for.,I was very disappointed in this product. The hinge is so skimpy that when you open up the jewel case for the first time it breaks. So far I've had to throw at least 30 away. http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bh25vSOvL._SL75_.jpg
5,CD Jewel Cases,"These are very nice. I now have all of my music, and data CDs in them, and am much happier becaue I can store them in racks now instead of piled all about like when they were in paper sleeves. This is a good product, and you can't go wrong for the price."
4,I feel so uncool,"but it just doesn't matter. This soundtrack is brilliant. Just try not to get all aglow when Sheena sings about a natural love. Try not to get into mood listening to ""Words into Action."" And the Bob Seger tune? Genius my friends. I wouldn't lie to you.The movie is great too. Yes, I know Rob and Demi are in it and it was the 80's but just let all that go."
5,Awesome Soundtrack!,So many great songs on this album. Really brings back good memories of that era and Chicago in general when I lived there.Don't miss this one if you're an 80's fan.
2,Review,I listened to this years ago when my sister had it but she then moved out and took it with her. I have looked around for ages for it and eventually found it on amazon. This cd has eveything from upbeat to slow songs. It's a great cd to listen to on any occasion.
1,HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"This is not worth the money in anyway shape or form. Iron Maiden is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE BANDS!!! However, $1,200 for 16 cds is just a complete waste of money. People considering buying this should really stop and think that they are almost paying $100 per cd. Do you realize how insane that is? Than as explained before the box it comes in is cheap. What is the point other than have everything that was released??? Merzbow if any of you have ever heard of them came out with a box set that is very rare that isn't even this expensive and it comes with 50 albums. Just think how you can get just about every cd from this collection on Amazon and probably not even spend anywhere near half the price of this. The only thing you won't get is a cheap cover made to look like Eddie's head just buy the collectible latex mask replica of Eddie floating around on amazon for only $20 it is not cheap whatsoever and adds much better to your collection than this."
1,Kinda Pointless.,"Unless you don't own any of the maiden albums, don't bother. The only reason you would need this is if you're really rich and can easily afford it or are a really big fan who does'nt own all the studio albums. That's the thing. 95% of this set is just the plain old albums and anyone who is big enough of a fan to want this set most likely already has all the albums anyway. There really is'nt enough extra stuff here to merit $250 of my potential nudie bar money!"
3,"An Awesome Box Set, but Too Highly Priced","This box set is awesome if you look at what it has. It has Enhanced CDs of Iron Maiden (self-titled) through The X-Factor (unfortunately, The X Factor is not an Enhanced CD)! But why only three stars? Because this may be a great item for any Maiden fan, however it is simply way too overpriced. If you already have the CDs, it is not worth it. Not only that, but you can purchase the collection of CDs included in this package for less than the price tag it holds. The reason it costs more is because of Eddie's head (where the CDs are held), which has with eyes that light up. Although this is a cool idea, the plastic head is not worth an extra $. So, if you're a true Iron Maiden fan, this might be a good buy for you, especially if you don't have the CDs included in this package. But, if not, you might want to think twice before spending this much money."
4,Fun to read and try,"First of all, don't buy this if you want to learn how to make straight-forward cocktails. These are innovative cocktails developed by some of the trendiest bars and eateries in the U.S. You might even have difficulty finding some of the alcohols mentioned in a number of recipes because they're often quite uncommon. With that said, if you have a well-stocked bar, then this book is recommended. It's also better than Cocktails 2005 because it includes recipes for bar food that look really tasty (e.g. sirloin burgers with onion jam). There are a number of drinks you'll probably never make (the squid ink martini with real squid ink!), but the rest should be fun to try!"
4,definitely modern,"I can't quite make up my mind about this CD. The first two tracks ""Disco Science"" and ""Naive Song"" are very modern tracks that will inevitably become quite cult. The tune is great and it really gives off some exciting vibes. However, one can't help but notice a vague similarity to Daft Punk, especially Disco Science. The other tracks are not bad, but slightly sub-standard when considering the first two. ""Paradise (Not for Me)"" which features Madonna is by all means a cool track but don't expect anything like Madonna's previous efforts (NB: This track is also on Madonna's ""Music""). All in all, it's easy to get excited about this CD, because all of the tracks are fairly novel, but you'll end up listening to just three of them (exceptional)"
3,madonna song is the best she did,"indeed! this song, ""Paradise (not for me)"" is just so delicate and, the album is worth it just for this song which last more than 6 minutes..the rest of the album is not so bad, ""I can't wait"" is quiet good, very Daft Punk type. Bref, buy it if you like experimental music, techno orientated and Madonna of course."
3,"Not Madonna, but better than ambient trance","I must say I'm a bigger fan of dance/trance when vocalization exists (makes the song more memorable to me rather than the ongoing drone of a dance beat), so therefore this disc is better than some of the electronica out there. Mirwais does use some computerized vocals and the Madonna tune, PARADISE, is included with a slightly different version than found on her CD, MUSIC. Being a fan of the old-school electronic artists, such as Kraftwerk, Gary Numan, early OMD...I found this CD bringing me back to 1979. Upon further listen, I will find this CD a keeper. I especially like NAIVE SONG."
2,A let-down,"After hearing ""Disco Science"" and ""Naive Song"" as well as, of course, Madonna's latest record, I decided to pick up this record. While it's not bad, and certainly the first two songs are excellent, the rest seems a little disorganized. ""V.I."" is just annoying, as is ""Junkie's Prayer"", and the remainder of the songs run into one another without making any real statement. That said, I think Mirwais is probably a talented gentleman and may be able to get his act together on some later material, for which I will be waiting. The New York Times' comment on the cover of ""Production"" which says, ""Witty and Startling"" seems stuck in my head. Startling, perhaps - witty, not as much."
3,Really Nice,I would have loved this rug in a larger size. Its thick...really thick. I love walking on it. Its easy to clean and holds its color and shape in spite of kids and a puppy. I love this rug.
3,Giuliani,"This is actually a compilation of works for classical guitar by Mauro Giuliani, mostly sets of variations. Quite fun to read through, some entertaining pieces in there."
2,Easy but not so tasty.,"I followed the instructions to the letter and there is still something missing from the flavor. It's a good thing I had on packet of soy sauce from ""Jacks"". The soy sauce helped with the flavor. Otherwise, it's OK."
1,Expiration Dates,"I wasn't overly happy with the flavor of these, but brought them to work in case someone else would like to try them. They weren't overly impressed either. BUT then I found out the ones I purchased in December carry expiration dates of February of this same year. I can't find a way to complain to Amazon yet, but I will! They might have tasted better if they were fresh."
2,Disappointing,"Compared to other brands of instant soup cups, Annie Chun's Hot and Sour Soup Bowl is pretty darn good. Compared to the other flavors of Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, this one is a major disappointment.The noodles are fabulous, and the veggies reconstitute very well, as with all Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, but unfortunately the flavor is really lacking. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it basically tastes like extremely watered-down hot and sour soup. I'm Annie Chun's biggest fan, so it pains me to leave a negative review, but the Hot and Sour is definitely out of my order rotation."
1,Hold the salt,"Tried the Hot and Sour soup bowl and the Ppad thai. Putting 970 and 1000 units of salt in those products turns them into an abomination. My wife and I took one spoonful of each, then prompty put the remainder down the disposal and went out to eat. What you do to those dishes at least is a terrible waste of food, in a time and in a nation when decent food is at a premius. For your sake, hope you have a good customer base because we won't be back, nor will any friends who share food reviews with us."
5,A Book that changed my life...,"I never would have thought that one novel I read when I was 12 could change my life...but I was proven wrong. This book opened the door to, so far, at least 5 other books for me, and has gained me many friends among others who have read them. It starts out as any modern novel might - with two high-school aged girls living in New York. But, through many twists and turns of events, they find themselves mixed up in a murder case, which dated years back, but still hasn't quite been solved. Each of the sisters has to try to fight back her normal instinct - or it could involve death for her and others. Will they be able to do it? You'll have to read the book to find out.Note: This is an older edition of the book. It has been revised since then, and some elements (nothing big) have been changed."
4,An evening with Werner Erhard,"As a graduate of the est training (1975), I enjoyed what felt like an evening with Werner Erhard; catching up with an old friend.If you were left with a bad taste in your mouth, from the 60 Minutes ""exposé"" in the 1990's, you owe it to yourself to watch this video and see what really happened and what he has been up to since then."
5,Wish it were longer...,"36 years ago I did the est Training, a pivotal, life-altering experience for me. It was so great to see the record set straight, after all the nonsense that has been written and said about this wonderful man...though admittedly, you can only cover so much in 77 minutes.I wish it had gone on and on, especially seeing Werner in action in the seminars. I highly recommend it.Bill Grady"
4,NICE COVERAGE OF THE FOUNDER OF E.S.T.,"The founder of EST from the 70s. I never took the courses as it was a bit before my time but I did a few of its children back in 2003 (Landmark, which sucked) and 2004 (Harmony in Utah ). Interesting take on the troubled life of a mover and shaker of the spiritual/consciousness movement. MY GRADE: B plus."
4,"Good film of an extraordinary man,","""Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds."" Einstein.I liked this film, I am grateful it posed some of the tough questions about Werner and his work, and I would have liked more exploration and history. I have deeply valued the impact of the learning I gained from participating in est and Landmark over the years, and am grateful to the film for reconnecting Werner to the American public. He wasn't and isn't a cult leader. He is a guru in the plain and simple sense of extraordinary thinker and teacher, and he is inspirational in the sense of getting me and others off our behinds and out of our minds (joke), and active and effective in our commitments to a better working world, starting with ourselves in our families. The film is worth watching just to learn.Another good quote: ""Minds are like parachutes; they only function when open."""
4,Intriguing Documentary,"For those who remember or were a part of the '70s personal growth program ""est,"" this intriguing documentary boasts two points of interest: the first interview with founder Werner Erhard since 1991 and rare, previously unreleased footage of est seminars. Transformation starts in the middle of the story, and doesn't completely explain what est actually involved and how it grew in popularity, but the film does provide adequate background information and a concise recap of Erhard's rise and fall from grace."
3,Can't put it Down,"The Italian's Runaway Bride was written in a way that made me not want to put it down. It is the type of romance novel that seems to just get you into the story, and how can one not love the young Kelly and her handsome, yet dense, husband. With many twists, in the end it all seems to work. I beleive this novel just proves that jumping to conclusions doesn't work, and trust is the key to any relationship. Well written and with characters that have a personality all to their own, Jacqueline Baird has written a wonderful romance."
4,A Very Interesting Read.....,"This is a classic case of the husband who is torn between believing his wife or his sister in law. His sister in law almost always wins. Poor Kelly, its rough when your husband sides against you almost all the time and you have to live with someone elses jealousy. Good Book."
4,Wonderful story!,This is Tyrone Power at his very best! The story is historically fascinating and based on Italian ancient history. Really fun! I recommended it!
2,Boring,"This is supposed to be a swashbuckler with lots of action and adventure. It is far from that. It is slow moving. Tyrone Power is as usual handsome, and beyond that gives a fair performance at best. Orson Welles as Cesare Borgia is ""over the top"" evil. Wanda Hendrix is not at all believable. She seems to be a teeny bobber in costume. How Tyrone could find her fascinating rather than the beautiful Marina Berti is hard to understand. It is too bad that this was filmed in black and white as the sets, countryside, and costumes would have been marvelous in color and possibly helped to add to the movie. The Alfred Newman score was also very fine."
4,Power never boring!,"Wanda Hendrix the the light weight starlet here. She was married to someone (can't remember now) semi famous.(Audie Murphy?) She ruins the picture for me and cannot play the love interest to the handsome, dashing Tyrone Power. Welles is always good and played with Tyrone in the Black Rose.Enjoyable movies of another place and time. Not full of 4 letter words and explicit bedroom scenes. Romantic and entertaining."
5,Great condition.,It was a gift and was difficult to find. In wonderful condition when I received it. No problems viewing it. and my husband loved it.
5,"The Story of Beth Finke , A Person You Would Love To Know","I loved this book , not because it is inspiring , which it is , but because it is the story of a fascinating , interesting , fun loving , intellegent , warm , beautiful , real woman ... there is nothing she can't accomplish ! This book reads so easily and with so much anticipation, I put everything aside until I finished it , and when I came to the end I could have started all over again ...... Thank you Beth Finke"
1,Marketing Drivel Pure as Driven Snow . . .,"This article is a glad-handing, ring-knocking rehash of all the vague and nearly meaningless drivel already available in copious quantity from the company's website regarding the iMIS product.Hardly worth the time to download, much less $5.95USD."
5,"The Book of Life, Series of 24 books","Very good books and I don't think they make them anymore. It has a lot of Biblical archaeology, Book by Book in the Bible that tells about the Book with Scriptures and pictures of how is was back then, a summary at the end of each book, prayer pointers, lots of history and it is a very good books with lots of information in them. I wish they would sell more but I can't find them and I bought mine in 1982. It looks like an encyclopedia set but it is the Book of Life set. Pam"
2,Good idea wrong materials,"Pros:It mounts well to my Action Extreme binoculars.The knob to tighten the screw that mounts the binoculars has plenty of grip.It is cheap.Cons:The big con is that on tightening my tripod mounting plate, the threads got stripped on the mount. The threads are large and widely spaced on tripod screws and so the amount of force on the threads is high. The same metal casting is simply threaded and so it is too weak to securely mount a tripod plate. I tried one of my plates with a longer screw and also found that the hole is too shallow for other designs. Nikon should have used harder metal for the hole and drilled it deeper."
4,Tripod adapter,"Compact and easy to use, works as advertised. Always good service and products from this company."
3,Pretty Good.,"I just got dis CD, I would say dat dis CD iz good, not as good as some ov there otha stuff but pretty dope. Check it out."
3,mostly useful for perfecting pronunciation,"I bought this originally because there is a surprisingly limited amount of material available for learning Spanish as it is spoken in its original home. Almost all of the Spanish material I had used treats the language as it is spoken in the Western Hemisphere, so this filled something of a gap. By practicing with the audio portion of the course it is certainly possible to get a good feel for the sounds of Continental Spanish. I didn't expect to learn a lot of vocabulary I didn't know, so I can't knock the course for that, but the usual irritations that come with these Routledge courses are out in force here- lots of words used in the dialogues and exercises that aren't in either the vocabularies or the glossary and a few that I couldn't even find in my excellent and well-thumbed dictionary. So three stars is as high as I'm willing to go, but for someone wanting to learn Spain Spanish rather than Latin American Spanish this isn't a bad thing to have."
1,not worth it,"This film as a dvd is quite annoying because the entire film is one chapter, not allowing you to navigate to a particular scene. The sound quality is terrible, the music annoyingly repetitive and while the ""rare"" film footage has some interesting moments the quality is so bad that you can barely make out what is happening. Also there are much better and dynamic shots of some of these budo masters that this film (because of copyright?) didn't make use of. More of a slide show the narration is ridiculously limited, the titles amateuristic and so all in all nothing is missed by not having this poorly researched and trite exercise."
5,spell bound,"I was spellbound over watching this fantastic production. Very, very interesting to see the great masters at work."
5,Employed For Life,"This book is an excellent ""fitness"" guide for the new workplace. Personally, I've decided to get and stay in shape. Frankly, since good jobs are going to be in shorter supply, I hope this book remains my little secret."
5,Different but Fantastic!!,"I love this album!!!! True, it is far different than their previous releases. However, was ""Neon Ballroom"" different from ""Freak Show?"" Different does not mean worse or bad. It still maintains the essence of Silverchair. The songs are moving, fun, intense, and everything inbetween. Fantastic!!"
4,"Not the same as there old stuff, but still good.","The new cd is soft compared to the earlier three. I think they have grown as artists. This cd came out after a year long break, and it is worthy of attention."
5,Worth The Wait,"this album has been pushed back a few times, but I've found it to be well worth the wait. I've loved this band's emotion ever since Frogstomp, and each album has gotten better. Diorama is no exception! This is a beautifully crafted album, while rocking hard at the same time. For those of you who still think of Silverchair as ""the little Australian Nirvana"", get over it! They have grown up, found their own sound, and in my opinion, are better than Nirvana ever was. Silverchair is still around, and you need this CD! By the way, they have 2 other albums, Freakshow and Neon Ballroom. GO GET ALL OF THEM!"
4,A Different Kind of View,"I have honestly heard mixed reviews of this album. It is a lot different than their albums Frogstomp and Freakshow, and that turns a lot of people off. I would have to say that it deffinetly is a different approach, but not a bad one. You can really tell where each band member grew as a musician. It is not my music of choice, but so cleverly put together, that it works. It is something that people should explore and experience."
4,Most musically progressive CD of the year,"Any negativity you may here about DIORAMA is from those looking for another simple minded grunge album, which it is not. It does rock hard, and it does it in a way unheard of before. Each track is filled with full string arrangemants and horn sections, redefining what we call ""rock"", and questioning the simplistic formulas rock-radio is filled with today.Daniels voice has matured into something very controlled and beautiful. Any time he spent on voice clearly shows, and the rythem section has clearly matured as well to complement and provide an excellent basis for the intricate melodies that fill the album. Buy it and try to understand... it'll be the most moving [money] you spend for a while!"
5,Fantastic,"I can't say enough about this band. They are so underrated in the states, lost in a pool of sound-alike garbage that's not fit to fix my speakers, let alone blare their lousy crap through them.Fantastic band, fantastic album. If you enjoyed Neon Ballroom at all, you'll love Diorama... there are even hints of their dynamic roots from Frogstomp.Highlights from the album:The Greatest View - Too Much of Not Enough - for the strong melodiesLever - for the hard edgeTuna in the Brine - for a nice swaying song and - After All These Years - for a sweet ending.Yeah, I did almost half the album in highlights.. and I could think of ones for the rest of them.. but then you'd think I was lying.Great stuff!"
5,AMAZING WORK OF ART,"This band is way underrated, except in Australia, at first everyone thought they were trying to copy Nirvana, but man, Daniel Johns is one of the best songwriters in the whole world, this album has a lot of colors so dont expect the same grey depressive stuff, but is a great album is really different and that is for me what its all about, give this album a try let it grow, its sure worth it, ***painting a lie, tuna in the brine**"
1,payola alive and well,"I have followed silverchairs work from the very beginning,and let me assure you that they are DONE.This recording has absolutely no resemblance to the band I knew as silverchair.To ad insult to injury,every review of Diorama that I have read has been nothing short of the second coming.This absolutely assures me that payola is still very much alive and well in the music industry.If you liked frogstomp or freakshow,diorama will make you cry.I can even handle neon ballroom,but diorama sounds more like a jellifish recording than silverchair.Shame on all the reviewers of Diorama for touting it as silverchairs best effort to date.They must have stuffed all of that record company money in their ears,because they're not hearing what I'm hearing."
1,Beter than Creed,"Well this cd is not any good. My cousin had me listen to this garbage bubble-gum pop that is so worthless, unlike the great grungde of the early 90s, which is when Silverchair's much better cd called Freak Show was made. That is my absolute favorite one because it rocks so hard (most of the time). I like Nirvana as well, and dumb bands like Creed and Metallica should stop trying to copy everything great grungde bands like this do. Those are two of the worst posers in the modern genere of rock and roll/grungde. But anyway this cd is alot like those morons from the Baskstreet Boys and stuff because they are soo boring and never ROCK and they never play their own instruments!!!!!! That is NOT ROCK, people! Get Freak Show or the first cd, which I own, and maybe Simple Plan too. Simple Plan is a great new band that sound a whole lot like Sliverchair but they are undoubtedly their own band in and of themselves. FREAK SHOW IS THE BEST AT EVERTYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A Bit Overrated -- The Van Dyke Orchestration Works,"I bought this based on rave reviews, noting how Van Dyke Parks added complexity and depth to their sound.And yes, for the three tracks that Van Dyke is on, this marriage works. You have sweeping melodies, massive harmonies, and fine guitar and vocal work by the boys. Van Dyke's dense orchestration adds space, content, and depth to these impressive tracks.It's the rest of the album where, for me, the boys have trouble maintaining a consistent tone, both in the production and in the songwriting.There are a few gems buried in here, and this would have made a terrific EP, but there's a bit too much filler to really make this a standout album."
1,Where Are The Days When They Had Rock On Their Minds,It's Simple Frogstomp and Freak Show rock and sound like rock. neon ballroom and this sound like a walse by mozart.WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY have you forgotten your roots
2,Change isn't always good,"I enjoyed silverchair ever since I first heard them in 1997. ""Abuse Me"" was a great song. I bought all there 4 albums at once cause I got a deal from the store, a promotion for their new album. ""DIORAMA"" was an extreme let down. After ""NEON BALLROOM"" I was hoping for there music to continue sounding that good, ""NEON BALLROOM"" was amazing. But ""DIORAMA"" is something completely different, where as there other 3 previous albums were about being depressed and all the other joys of being a teen, they suddenly became a happy pop-ish sounding band. There were only 2 songs really worth listing to on that album, ""The Lever"" and ""One Way Mule"" the rest were just not really sounding like the chair I enjoyed listing to. Had I not gotten the other 3 albums with it as well as the limited edition single ""Pins in my Needles"" I would have not even bothered getting it. It's a great album is you like happy music but if you want to here classic chair music you'll not find it here."
2,Step in a really terrible direction,"Most of this album sounds like Johns (lead singer) has gone way too far in trying to make a middle-school slow dance album. Im dissapointed in the production by David Bottrill who also produced Tool's Lateralus which was earth shattering and might be the best produced album ever. Perhaps I dont know whats going on behind the scenes, perhaps Disney bought silverchair and told them what to play... who knows, its possible. I personally take offense to the review that compared the song ""Without You"" to Radiohead, it sounds more like Creed, and Johns stepped in for Scott Stapp (their drunken recluse singer). Anyways, Silverchair used to be kind of cool, even though there lyrics and complete ripping off of a Nirvana like grunge was for the most part mediocre. To top it all off, their album cover looks like a cool advert for a new mysterious kind of chewing gum. But Ill give them two stars, cause frogstomp was cool when I was in fourth grade!"
2,What???,"I can understand that the grunge era has passed, but there are much better alternatives than [bad] pop music. What happened to the band with a little bite and some heavy sound. Instead we get Sean Cassidy singing to Enya music. Hopefully they are just going through a phase and will rethink where they are going or just hang it up. I can't take any more of this!!"
2,HUH!!!!!!!??,"I had to pop the CD back out to make sure this was really Silverchair. Not quite what I expected. Should definitely have had a warning on the label, ""If you are expecting Silverchair, wait for their next album (Hopefully)). I will agree that some of the lyrics are pretty good, but I threw away my BeeGee's albums a long time ago. Let's get some edge back to the music or go the way of STP and Tiny Music, YUCKKK."
1,WHAT THE HECK?!!!,"What the hell is this crap? I'm very open when it comes to different kinds of music but i really dont get this cd. its not what u'd expect from Silverchair either! i mean what happened to mindblowing songs like ""suicidal dreams"", ""shade"", or even ""abuse me"". I miss the old silverchair! come back!!!"
1,Not The Silverchair I Know,"This CD is Bad! Bad not meaning good, I was hoping to listen to some real rock/metal Sabbath type music that Frogstomp was all about. I don't know what this is, their are violins or something on this disc. Do me a favor, don't buy it, get is used & then burn it!"
3,diorama is great.,"Daniel has a great voice, although this record is different amoung the others they have put our in the past years, it is a great cd. This band is very talented and do not limit themselves to what they can and can't do. It also includes catchy melodies."
2,Self-conscious growth,"2 1/2The kind of heavy alternative pop that is modestly ambitious in its limited compositions, eventually coming across more contrived than catchy or compelling for the discerning listener despite winning moments."
5,the ultimate record,"hey lucky people reading this, u must purchase 'Diorama' its the greatest recording ever by the band, or any other band its literally that good!!!words cant describe the beauty it contains, the sheer genious of the music. musical heaven indulge urself, u'll never look back, a must own, even if its not really ur type u must own it & appreciate it for its brilliance. its unlike anything that has been done before and moves away from the mainstream manufactured sounds flooding the market currently.the album is unique bliss, it has its lush melodic moments and ... rock tracks, versitile, diverse, miracle music by the worlds most amazing music mind Daniel Johns, pure talent backed up by the most fun loving and skilled band mates Chris and Ben.all hail the genious beauty orginality that is silverchair, 'Diorama'."
3,DIORAMA,"Diorama is a mix of grunge with strange lyrics. Silverchair is one of my favorite bands, ""Diorama"" is a decent cd. I would have to say Neon Ballroom is better, but ""Diorama"" is alright. The music in the cd is very good, but the style just isn't Silverchair. Some of the songs resemble their olds songs, but most of the songs are very much unlike them. I would recommend the cd to people, I still love the cd, i am just a little disappointed in the lyrics."
4,Pleasant listening experience,"As with many bands that the grunge era birthed, Silverchair embraced the fact that in order to survive in today's pop culture they must shy away from the heavy monotonous riffs that many fans have grown to love. Daniel Johns and company have always been fighting to earn respect. Mostly due to the fact that they began so young. With Diorama, Silverchair has finished the startling transformation that began with Neon Ballroom: from aggressive, blind emotion to beautifully-refined, intelligent music. And that respect has been earned.If you are looking for something along the lines of what you heard on Frogstomp or Freakshow, you may be disappointed. What you can expect to hear are songs that feel and sound more like ""emotion sickness"" and ""do you feel the same?"" from Neon Ballroom. One last thing about this cd that I found notable is the vast refinement and improvement in Daniel Johns' voice. It is near angelic. You should check this cd out for that, if nothing else."
4,A good release in a week full of good releases,"Wow, I rushed to my car after school and raced over to the local music store to pick up this, the new coldplay, queens of the stone age, and jimmy fallon cd. Even though they're all great this remains my favorite (even though I've only had it for around six hours). Silverchairs' sound has definatley evolved but you can still hear similarites all the way back to frogstomp. Part of that is due to the new producer, who I think used to work on the beach boys albums. Anyway, the band continues to add more layers of music, as hinted on in neon ballroom. The strings and horns sound great mixed with the standard insturments. The only reason I took off a star was because the track order was a tad bit off, and it isn't a stellat album like urban hymes. Needless to say I really loved this album and since I'm so picky about my music, that says a lot. If you preferred the softer sounds of freakshow and neon ballroom, this album is for you"
5,WOW!!!,"What can I say? This album is pure genious. I'm not saying that from a disgruntitled and obsessed fan's point of view, even though I am a disgruntitled and obsessed fan. From a music lover's point of view, it is a genious rock album. The songs flow so well, and the orchestration is amazing. This would still be one of my favorite albums even if I hadn't heard of Silverchair before ""Diaroma."" Don't even finish reading this review. Stop wasting precious time reading my rambling. BUY IT NOW."
2,Post-grunge art-pop-wannabe nonsense,"Daniel Johns is everything wrong with Australian alternative music. He is the gullible public's ""musical genius"", a egomaniacal dictator whose musical offerings have infested commercial radio every time his ""band"" releases its latest ""masterpiece"". Diorama, released in 2002, is complete and utter tripe, with second-rate melodies and pompous arrangements filling out its interminable 57 minutes. Johns' forays into grunge are offputting here, but it is the overwhelming pretentiousness which makes this unlistenable (the minor success is opener 'Across The Night'). Diorama is one of those releases which is easy to like initially, but forgettable for the more discerning."
2,It's the effort that counts,"In a media world driven by technology, We often run into lackluster music that has been generated by machines and is overproduced. Has real rock'n'roll become a thing of the past? Silverchair has lost it's credibility as a rock band and has become sadly enough, mediocre. Understandeably artists and bands mature and evolve, yet this seems to be merely a copout. The album of late, Diorama, seems overproduced and overscored. Although most fans hail this piece as being their best work it, in my opinion, their most commercial and lackluster effort yet. I wouldn't spend the twenty bucks on it...borrow it if you know what I mean."
3,Confusion perhaps?,"This cd tells a lie so well. I don't know whether to like it or not. Musically, this is very good. But, I remember silverchair being angry, unhappy.. The songs sounded important. This doesn't sound important. The songs grab you, but...The other silverchair cds are tornados and earthquakes. This is a sunny day. You pay close attention to tornados and earthquakes, but on a sunny day, I'm left squinting and wishing it weren't so bright."
2,An over-egged pudding,"Yet another futile attempt to better 'Pet Sounds'.This album would have made a good ep but after The Greatest View (easily the best song on here)every song sounds the same (i.e. overblown and packed full of string sections).Listening to this in one session is akin to being trapped in a corner at a party with an over-enthusiastic orchestra.By the way, if you are looking for the new 'Pet Sounds' check out 'Universal Bubble' by a couple of guys outta the UK by the name of The Glove Puppets. I got the CD by chance when over in England last year and it's hardly been off my player since - Think Brian Wilson songs sung by Lennon and McCartney. It's that good !!"
5,I've got one word WOW...,"Yes I hear all the reviews that say the album is s**t because it sounds nothing like Silverchair used to...and in my opinion that's what makes this album so amazing...I am a musician, and I totally respect bands when they are NOT afraid to change their sound and are NOT afraid to experiment...that is why I totally respect Daniel Johns and the awesome work he did on this album...he went out on a whim and decided to do something different...as the band matures so does their sound...I especially love the first track which is very reminiscent of a little Beatles, a little Queen, and a whole lot of great sounnd...the orchestrations, everything...all I can say again is wow...for those who have not picked up the album, really do, it will totally be worth it, whether you are a Silverchair fan or not...you definately will become one after hearing this album..."
2,"A nice toy, less than five dollars, worth seeing the hype","This is absolutly a non useful gadget. Had mine three plus years now, collecting dust. I always use my real sewing machine. Tried this the first night I had it, couldn't go through one layer of thin material, and I think I heard something break. But...for nastalgia purposes I have to keep this handy. I got it as a gag gift, I know the person who gave it to me spent less than 5 bucks for it at that time. I just had to put my word in for this item, because it was highly advertised, sold probably millions, and didn't really do anything. Stick with a needle and thread if you have to stitch on the run."
2,Imagine There's No Residuals,"Imagine there's no Yoko,It isn't hard to do,Nothing to shill or buy for,No dividends too,Imagine the investorsHaggling for a piece...Imagine there's no trademarks,I wonder if you can,No need to strip mine demos,Plundering John's old tapes,Imagine the promotersMaking a quick buck...You may say she's a schemer,But she's not the only one,There's lots of other hucksters,Looking out for number one."
3,Not essential. Collectors will enjoy this.,"This consists of outtakes and unreleased tracks. I think true Lennon fans will value this more than the casual fan. The song ""HERE WE GO AGAIN"" may perhaps be the best thing on it.I give the collection 3 stars."
2,For collectors only,"John Lennon is a genius, but even geniuses have slow days. This is a disc released after his untimely death. If you want to know what John is all about don't start with this disc. Start with Imagine or the Beatles stuff."
5,You know what they say about opinions...,"I don't know why everybody is ragging on this CD. I just went back and listened to it again. I love it and I hate John Lennon. To me it shows a side of Lennon that wasn't all that ""peace & love, hippy, save the world"" garbage. I don't care if you the reader buys this CD or not, but I just felt compelled to defend it because it happens to be one that I listen to every couple of years and I never get tired of it. I really have to be in the mood for it, but I think that's what good music is...something that you don't get tired of over time. This recording also defies genre classification because it's a mixture of Blues/Rock & Roll/Folk. It's definetly not for everyone and I couldn't listen to it more than once or twice a year, but IMO it's a solid piece of live Lennon. Who I hate very much. Except for this CD."
2,This is by far John's worst lp...,"...but don't blame him - he never wanted it released (at least that is the speculation). It was Yoko who released it, either because she is a money-grubbing biatch, or because she had no concept of which of John's songs are good and which are not.In any case, this album pretty much sucks. There are better BOOTLEGS out there of unreleased Lennon material; however for the most part, those too are a waste of time. Stick with the official releases at least until you have heard all of those.If you are a big Lennon fan you may want this album, just to hear it and complete your collection. If you are a beginning or intermediate fan, stay away from this album.Go with ""Plastic Ono Band"" (his first solo album), ""Imagine"", ""Mind Games"", and ""Walls and Bridges"" for his best solo work.If you want unreleased stuff AND a good collection, go with the Box Set."
1,Who's a genius?,"I was thinking of buying this album, but then one of the reviewers snarled that it was so awful it almost made him think McCartney was the genius of the Beatles. Well, wasn't he? Why are you Lennon fans so cramped and dogmatic? Why can't you accept that the Beatles were succesful because they were a team effort; with two geniuses, and George Harrison occasionally a third? It'll be a year before I think again of giving money to Ono."
3,a curiosity,"No, Jim, he was (and is) NOT. Why do we say such things? Gee, could it possibly have something to do with such excruciatingly abominable recordings as ""Band on the Run"", ""Listen What the Man Says"", ""Live and Let Die"", and ""Silly Love Songs""? Need I go on? You want more examples? There is such a thing as good taste, and there is such a thing as B-A-D taste."
1,More [stuff] from Junkie John,"This album almost makes Barry Manilow look like a genius. What was Yoko thinking by releasing this garbage...oh yeah, MONEY. Well this is the last dime I spend on this junkie."
1,A 45-RPM record disguised as an LP,"MENLOVE AVENUE, a leftovers collection released after John Lennon's death, offers two good songs: ""Here We Go Again,"" a Lennon-Phil Spector original, and ""Rock and Roll People,"" a demo that must have been heard by Johnny Winter, who tore it up on his outstanding JOHN DAWSON WINTER III album. Two good songs would make a 45-RPM single, but the rest of MENLOVE AVENUE - rejects and demos from Lennon's ROCK N ROLL and WALLS AND BRIDGES albums - make for a forgettable LP. Hard core Lennon fans will want to hear MENLOVE AVENUE once, but on the second listen they won't play it past track two."
4,"Review of ""The Day is Ours!""",Dwyer gives more than just a history of the Trenton-Princeton campaign. He has painstakingly researched the written comments of the participants in the struggle from Generals Washington and Cornwallis to the lowest Privates and civilians. He lets you know what those who were actually there thought about what was going on in their own words.He also explains how the surprise victories for the little Continental army could easily have misfired. There were many chance events that favored the Continentals that could have gone the other way.My criticisms are that it could have used more maps and he goes into more detail about the lives of certain individuals more than seemed necessary
5,History in the Trenches,This is my kind of history. The book is largely first hand accounts of the Battles of Trenton and Princeton from diaries written by persons who were there. This is a book that I found so interesting I didn't want to do anything else until I had finished it. It allowed me to visualize the events as they happened and gain a feel for what it must have been like to be there. I especially liked the author's detailed presentation of how despondent the nation was following the battle losses during the last months of 1776 and how the victories at Trenton and Princeton renewed support and saved the revolution. I also gained an appreciation for the challenges faced by persons who either participated or were affected by the battles. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn more about these battles and life during the American Revolution.
3,The Titan 550 EZ Burn,Notorious for overheating and burning out- be prepared to get a spare 550 or two at the best price you can find.
4,Very inspirational,Darius McCrary is an excellent singer. This movie is not Oscar worthy but it is a feel good movie. I really enjoyed it. The singing is excellent. I always enjoy watching this movie.
5,One of Billy Graham's best films yet,"Along with ""A vow to cherish"", these two are my favorite of all the films made by Billy Graham's team. Because these two films have the gospel message being the central driving force and changing power in the main characters. You can see how grace and forgiveness are lived out in real lives. Other Billy Graham's films are great also. I would watch any Billy Graham's film over all other secular films. Secular films may be entertaining and very well made, but they all leave me feeling no peace and craving for more entertainment. On the otehr hands, all of Billy Grahams film leave me encouraged and inspired to love God and my neighbors in a real way. Go watch all of Billy Graham's films and see if you agree!"
5,Excellent Media Studies Text,One of my professors used only a section of this text book. It was so compelling that I decided to purchase for my own edification.
1,good for beginners,"Hall is tendentious, unscientific, and very, very ""academic"" in what that term had come to mean by the late 20th century.Sort of dated. good like monach or cliff review notes;not much thinking involved; not much that is not terribly old, cliched."
2,Caution - This may not be what you get,"I am a big Star Trek fan and a big Amazon fan so imagine how pleased I was (after having bought this calendar way back in August) to see that this looked like a totally different cover for the same year (2005).However, when I recently received the calendar it was the same white background as the one I had purchase several months ago. I have contacted Amazon customer service and they could not yet determine if there are indeed two different calendars. They are investigating. In the meantime, I thought I would enter this review to keep other Star Trek ""nuts"" like myself (who absolutely must collect ever different calendar) from making my mistake.I will update this review as soon as I get a definitive answer from Amazon. Until then...CAUTION...what you see is not what you get!"
3,Needs to go where no calender has gone before.........,"Unlike last years calender; this one does not have any intricate backgrounds with the Enerprise. It's just a plain white background with the photo in the middle. Some of them look like they were taken from calenders of years past. This is why there are no Deep Space Nine, Voyager, or Next Generation calenders. The creative spark is gone and the pictures the artist has chosen have long been seen before."
4,Great Purchase,Enjoy having a larger capacity for water if I am out on the rocks or using for group water purification with my MIOX pen. Allows me to treat more water at once without carrying bulky container. Works for car camping too.
4,Really like mine,"I have the 6 liter version. It packs great - molding around everything else in the pack. It seems very durable - no problems so far. It fits easily in my backpack's water bladder compartment. The three different nozzles for getting water - a 2 inch opening, a 1/2 inch nozzle and a small straw-like nozzle - are very useful. The water stored in the bladder does have a very slight plastic taste, but nothing objectionable. I highly recommend this."
4,Does what it should!,This pack is very durable I even use it as a (water) pillow when I go camping. It holds liquids well but lack of insulation makes it reach outside temperatures fairly quick.
4,MSR Water Bag,"I have used a rival brand water bag for a while now, and was unsatisfied with the feeling that it would leak at the nozzle, the MSR does not have that feeling, but lets be honest the 3 different outlet sizes? I'd prefer one and less chance of a leak.Upside is that the screw on large cap is the same as the nalgene bottle, so the katadyn filter screws right on.Price is good, very sturdy construction, and doesn't taste like plastic when used. I'm hard on gear and am confident this will last well and live up to expectations."
4,Decent film quality,"Reviewers of previous releases of this film have mentioned problems with the film quality, hence I bought this re-mastered version. The quality is fine, bearing in mind the film's age, without the problems highlighted in previous releases.It's a DVD-R of course, but I haven't had any problems watching the film on my DVD player."
2,Decent transfer for this old film,"DVD transfer is decent but not great. This film suffers from too many very dark scenes and too few minutes with Miss Rogers on camera. Lyle Talbot is just not that amusing as the he attempts to carry the picture. This is a murder mystery with folks dropping dead throughout the picture. However, the wit (or lack thereof) is what keeps this from being rated higher.Recommended to: Old movie fans and fans of Ginger Rogers."
2,Jane's Compilation,"I copped JA's Live And Rare nearly ten years ago. The thing about this album is that it is intended for the JA fan, yet it doesn't yield anything particularly rare. It opens with the song that catapulted them to fame: a remix to 'Been Caught Stealing' that features polished guitars and some alternate placement of lyrics. Two tracks later is a decent live concert medley of 'L.A. Woman', 'Nausea' and 'Lexicon Devil'. The centerpiece of the record is the epic 'Three Days' that features nothing different from the original album version apart from it being split into two sections. Add three other live tracks and three demos and that is what you get."
3,True Crime Lover,"Although the book is fairly well written, it left too many unanswered questions. I got more information by reading the Court TV files. I agree with the previous reviewer, its not worth the price. Wait for the hardback."
2,book lover,"I was a little disappointed with the writing style of this book. It reads like a newspaper article or court transcript. The character development was weak. There was so much more to the personalities involved, but he barely scratched the surface. We know very little about the upbringing of the murderer and very little about the victim, although the author seems to have had plenty of access to close family and friends. With the back-drop of Atlanta, Black class and priviledge, southern culture, etc., this could have been an amazing book! Too bad."
3,Left me wanting more,Detail detail detail. More autopsy photos. More Dionne family history. More history of employees. Still a decent read for a flight.
2,A confusing read,"I had problems with the writing style and the errors. The books jumps around in time for no apparent reason: one minute you're in 1998 then the next page you're in 2002 then the next page you're back to 2001 (and much of the time you're not sure where you are in time). Most of the time the writer uses third person and seems to be working from research then suddenly bam!, he's in the story. Then he's gone again. Very distracting. And the errors (obvious to an Atlantan) made me question the research and how accurate the book is. Even the title is weird - a reference to the fact that the victim liked light-skinned women, a detail but not really significant enough to the story to make sense as the title. I enjoyed the insight into a segment of Atlanta society but I did not enjoy the narrative or writing."
2,"Redbone: Money, Malice and Murder in Atlanta",Wait until this book comes out in paperback. I purchased this book and it was not filled with a lot of details. I watched this case on Court TV and this book came no where close to the actual trial.
3,Good Mystery,Interesting case. Details on the investigation show the lack of thorough police searching thru each and every detail. Very good research on the authors part to get all the facts and present a well complied book.
3,Not Worth $25.00,"The first time I heard of this case was on Oxygen's Snapped. It was very interesting to know how this murder happened, so when a book was published I was very excited to read. After reading this book, I was very upset that I wasted my money. It was highly repetitive, and at times, it put me to sleep. I would have liked to read more about Dionne (the killer) and the relationship with the victim, as well as more storylines...not so much about every single detail about the court case. Be prepared to be deviated from the focus of the story as well with chapters about random people. I want my money back."
3,My grandkids love this music,"These stories of Tubby the Tuba and Celeste enchanted me and my kids when we were children. I bought this CD for my grandchildren, who also love it. This recording, however, was somewhat flawed. The ""Once"" in ""Once upon a time"" doesn't come through on the first story. My alert 5-yr-old granddaughter caught that and said, ""It's not at the beginning!"" She got used to it after a while, however, and now doesn't complain. Also, in the story of Celeste, the volume suddenly rises half way through the story. Again, my granddaughter doesn't mind, but I have to run over and turn it down! Anyway, these aren't major flaws, and the recording is still worth while, but I thought potential buyers should know."
4,a solid effort,"89 cubs is a post-hardcore band that features members of bright eyes, desaparecidos and the good life. I would reccomend this album to anyone who enjoys the saddle creek bands or superchunk-type bands. ""Sorry Tornado"" is reason to buy this album alone."
2,Ugly and uncomfortable.,"These shoes are not functional at all. They are velvet all over making it impossible to go outside when wet or slightly wet. Also the rubber sole? It's a very hard rubber, there's no give. You'd be better off walking barefoot. The sequins are also coming off after a few wears- but when you buy it for $2 at Target, I guess I can't ask for much."
3,A Perfect Seduction by Joanna Mansell (Large Print Harlequin Hardcover),"Description from the book back cover:'If you really want to know the truth, Francine, you'll have to marry me.' Out of the sultry Venetian dusk a dark, sensual stranger came to rescue her - then to bewitch her, and finally to seduce her. Francine Allen was here to work, not to fall in love. But how could resist the feverish excitement that Alessandro Zancani aroused in her? He appeared to be the perfect lover - but hadn't he already said that he like to play games? Francine knew that she was playing with fire, but she just had to find out ..."
3,Great music but........,"This was the second All Things Must Pass album that I purchased from Amazon, the first one being the ""box set"". On the box set, disc 2 could not be read by my laptop, although disc 1 was just fine. So I returned that album and was sent another. Same problem. So I sent it back for a refund and ordered this album, the Digi-Pak edition. Same problem! Both discs will play on my home stereo, but disc 2 will not play, or even be noticed by the laptop."
3,Dysfunctional Packaging,"While others have touted the musicality, new songs, remastering and intentions behind Harrison's reissue, his allusion to the new packaging in the accompanying booklet as a response to the ""concret[ing]"" over of ""our planet"" is a bit overstated. In truth the new packaging is dysfunctional. While the ironic cover pictures are a welcome diversion, the cardboard covers for the individual discs are too small and too tight. This cumbersome design makes it difficult to remove the discs from their covers, and when finally extracted they inevitably have small bits of cardboard on the playing surface. In short, do not expect to be able to use the original packaging for storage. Harrison's comments notwithstanding, this is not the only recently released box set with this type of packaging. This design may be the wave of the future; another ""better idea"" that is cheaper to produce, but impractical and functionally inferior to the former product."
4,this album is very good,this album all things must pass is very good I believeGeorge Harrison was a better composer than John Lennon
3,Over rated - too many bad songs,"There was a reason George only got one or two songs per Beatles album! Way way too much filler here for a triple disc album - just not enough quality songs to fill 2 albums yet alone 3!?! One can start with the ""jam"" album which totally blows - and then many of the songs on the first two albums totally stink too - boring - zzzzzzzzzz. Too bad because this would have been a killer single album."
2,Who butchered this?,"This is a remix of a previously excellent compilation. Not so much now, though. The cuts have been remixed, cuts have been added, and the quality just isn't there. Total disappointment."
5,I waited to long to hear this,"This is a fantastic album I waited far to long to hear. But maybe it was good to wait for this remastered version given what others said about the first release's sound quality issues. The music is superb, as good as much Beatles music. In Harrison's catalog, some of his songs are strange, but this entire album is strong. The instrumentals on disc 2 are just fantastic music in terms of guitar work. I'd love to see Brad Paisley record the ""Jeep"" number just to see how another eminent guitarist in another genre would put his spin on it."
5,Best post-Beatles album,"George surprised the world with this record right after the Beatles split up. It is still one of the best post-Beatles albums with Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and Macca's Band on the Run. The outdated production sounds authentic now. George showed for the first time that he could come up with (more than) an album of great self-penned songwriting. Bless you, George!"
3,Still a great album 30 years later,"This album is one of my all time favs. The only reason I give it three stars is the lack of new material. I live for you and the new my sweet lord (esp I live for you) are great additions, I guess there just wasn't much more in the recording sessions for George to add. If you never got this album BUY IT.... if you have it already, the remixing is good, but you'll be buying it mostly for those two tracks. I just hope that George hurries his other recording :)"
2,living on reputation alone,"After many years (+20) I've relistened to this post-Beatles extravaganza. In retrospect this album a) is way overrated with sloppy play and very pedestrian songs save the soaring ""What is Life""; b) was in desparate need of George Martin as producer; c) has jam session that demonstrating George's solid rock chops but are embarrassing in simplistic structure - could have come from a bad McCartney album. Cloud Nine and the vastly underrated George Harrison (1978) have far more interesting songs and production."
2,"great music, horrible re-mastering/recording","Unfortunately, my high-end system really exposes horrible sound recording/mastering on this CD. Screechy guitar, muddy sounding vocals, etc. Buy an LP if you can, or maybe the original CDs."
2,Bloated,"I would have given this 2 1/2 stars if I could. I would like to see a ""naked"" version like they did with Let It Be. Make this a one CD release with all of Specter's horrible production removed. Harrison can write some great tunes, but he is hit and miss--mostly miss."
2,I should have passed,"I like the Beatles, and I thought George's were the best Beatle songs. I like Concert for George and I like other people playing his music. After watching/listening to Concert for George, I decided to get a George CD to round out my music a bit.Read all the glowing great 5-star reviews for ATMP, and recognized a couple of the popular songs, so I figured I was in for a treat. However, as much as I hate to say it, I can't even give it an average rating. I've listened to it enough times on the way to work (and once at home during an exercise in music appreciation) to be caught by any catchy tunes or inspired songs, and I'm afraid there aren't very many. Yes, there is My Sweet Lord, Isn't It a Pity, What Is Life, If Not For You (isn't it a Dylan song) - and that's about it. I try to get into Wah-Wah (though somewhat muddled) and try to like some of Beware of Darkness. Beyond that it is a struggle to listen to, I'm sorry to say. (I ended up donating to the collection at work.)"
5,Don't hesitate to purchase this one,"If you loved the original ""All Things Must Pass,"" then don't allow yourself to second-guess the idea of purchasing this version. I held off buying this CD because I thought the original vinyl was good enough for me. I'm glad I re-thought that decision. This remastered CD is marvelous. It's even better than and will renew your love of the first album. And if you've never heard ""All Things Must Pass,"" then buy it. You'll quickly find out why George Harrison was far more than a Beatle to so many of us."
5,MY LORD THIS IS A SWEET DISK,George's passing hit me almost as hard as John's but this CD takes some of my pain away. All things must pass indeed but I think people will be listening to this music for as long as the human race survives and we have ears. In whatever format. This is a wonderful disc. I think George's best solo work and right up there with The Beatles. I REALLY REALLY LOVE the instrumentals they flat out ROCK. You really MUST have this disc. Thanks George goodbye
4,Spirit from a Beatle,"When the Beatles were recording in the 1960s, those of us who were total fans and knew every album and single word-by-word also knew we were missing out since there never seemed to be enough room for more than maybe one George Harrison song.After the group split, the album All Things Must Pass proved to be filled with songs Harrison fans had always just known were sitting inside his quiet and spiritual demeanor. George Harrison may not have been able to answer all the big questions but he sure tried - especially in this varied collection."
4,"Great music, shame about the CD.","This great work set the standard to judge all Beatles solo work. Outsold everything and regarded highly by fans. Deserves 5 stars but EMI/Capitol let us down by mastering from a poor 3rd generation copy tape. Pre-digital, with so many layers and reduction mixes, the original master needs all the help it can get. George was willing to remix it but EMI didn't want to know. ""Isn't It A Pity?"""
4,How about a reissue?,"It would be nice if ""All Things Must Pass"" were reissued with improved sound, the original LP-size box, and the original booklet. I'd also be willing to pay the extra bucks if it were reissued as a 3-CD set paralleling the original 3-LP set. The present configuration and packaging don't do justice to this wonderful album."
5,The best album in the history of rock music,"George Harrison is perhaps the most unfairly criticized and most underappreciated rock artist. All Things Must Pass is simply the best album in the history of rock music with legitimate competition only from Layla and The White Album. In the years since this masterpiece was released, criticism of George Harrison has always been colored by the fact that he never again matched the brilliance of this record.....but neither has anyone else in the intervening 29 years. As far as his other solo work is concerned, I would match up a true ""best of"" George against anything anyone else has to offer for a career."
5,If Layla merited box set treatment...,"Message to EMI/Capital: The 30th Anniversary of the album approaches - why don't you do something right with SOMETHING in the Beatles/ex-Beatles catalog? Why not remix/remaster this wonderful album, include some outtakes and those wonderful demos, and put it in a full-size box that would include the original artwork and poster, as well as a book with pictures and information from the historic sessions?Put a reasonable price-tag on it and you'd sell a bunch. Plus be doing posterity and George's fans a BIG favor."
5,He's so fine,"A jewel of an album! Probably one of the best if not *the* best Beatles solo album ever released -- every song (not counting the instrumental jams) is a gem. The rerelease is fabulous - great remixing of songs, nice extras (esp. the ""new"" track ""I live for you""), incredible packaging. A lot of care and thought went into the re-release -- it will not disappoint."
5,George Harrison's Ninth Symphony!,"I must admit it took me several tries to make it through the whole album (it was released on 3 lps!). But once I took the whole thing in, I was blown away! George Harrison didn't really become a songwriter/composer until the White Album, but by the time the Beatles broke up and George made ATMP, he had surpassed Lennon and McCartney. And this album proves it. It can easily hold a candle to Abbey Road and The White Album, and it eclipses every other solo Beatle album. It might even be better than any Beatle album. Actually, IT IS better than any Beatles album! THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE A BEATLE! You gotta love the jams with Derek and the Dominoes at the end. ""Wah-Wah"", ""My Sweet Lord"", ""Let It Roll"", ""I Dig Love"",""Isn't It A Pity""...come on! The music never ends! And its great!!! I recommend this to any Beatle fan, any music lover, anybody with ears!"
5,I'm happy with my purchases,But I never got the droid. I did get my money refunded. I ordered sevral gift cards and while complaining about the droid the gift cards got cancelled. I was unable to have them delivered to my brother. Everything came to me.
4,George Freaks Out!,"When I first heard this album when it was released, I thought it was great mainly because I was rooting for Harrison to break free from under John and Pauls domination of the Beatles music. No doubt there are some great songs here, but the Phil Spector Production ruins almost every one except My Sweet Lord. Harrisons music does not warrant the overdone production it receives here. However, Harrison prevails on this album mainly because the songs are good."
3,George Harrison's All Things Must Pass,"Ordered this after seeing the special on George Harrison on HBO by Martin Scorcese: it has so many songs on it, that i forgot about!Just great music with wonderful words to inspire us all to live better lives and to be kind to all.Love it, and so glad I have it."
5,Garbo Talks!,"I remember that being a headline after this release from the ""underdog"" Beatle. This classic rightly deserves the name ""masterpiece""-from beginning to end it's simply flawless and evokes so many emotional responses in the listener-the thing great art is supposed to do. If you purchase only one Harrison album make it this one. You just can't go wrong."
5,Thirty Years does not dimish this recording's impact,"It was the impact of this album that when it was first released moved George Harrison out from under the shadow of Lennon/McCartney. The variety, depth, and quality of the songs contained here are withoug a doubt a paradise for anyone who enjoys music. Time has not diminshed the impact these songs have, anyone of which puts today's music to shame. The title track, as well as ""Isn't It a Pity"" and ""The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp"" are as fresh sounding today as they were when I first heard them 30 years ago. Run, don't walk to get this wonderful album that not only stands as an equal to The Beatles ""Abbey Road"" and ""Let It Be"", but is superior to many of the solo John Lennon and Paul McCartney albums. George may not record often but when he does it is worth buying, and buying at once."
4,"Good material, bad packaging","The recording is excellent; the quality is very good and the material is vintage Harrison stuff... well done. But why the bulky packaging? This two-CD set should be in a standard-size double-disc jewel case so it could fit on our shelves or in portable CD carriers. It's an important album for Harrison fans, but needs a better package!"
5,George's Masterwork,"The remastered ""All Things Must Pass"" (1970) has been long overdue. It remains George Harrison's finest recording and one of the few truly outstanding Beatle solo albums. Harrison gave new meaning to producer Phil Spector's ""Wall of Sound"" with this lavish production. The reissue sounds terrific and the bonus tracks (particularly the Dylan-influenced ""I Live For You"") are most welcome, even though they should have been sequenced at the very end."
5,Monumental!!,"This was quite an undertaking for George as he attempted to get out from under the shadow of Lennon and McCartney. With a little help from his friends he succeeded admirably. Among Beatle solo albums this is only exceeded by Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and McCartney's Band on the Run. The guest stars include Ringo, Eric Clapton and Badfinger among many others. The sound is huge because of Phil Spector's help with production duties. The album is large in scope too. Originally three records, it now has five extra tracks. The song writing is very strong. The only dark cloud hanging over it is the plagiarism suit years later over the melody of My Sweet Lord. Baby George had finally come of age with a nearly flawless album."
4,Great Album - Great Condition,"Not quite an original pressing but an early one, certainly, this album arrived quickly and in excellent condition, including all the extras in the original packaging."
5,All Things Must Pass,George really was way too underrated. This album will always be a classic.Delivered within a few days and in perfect condition. I've played it every day since I received it and love it.
3,"Dunno maybe it's me, not overly impressed",Nothing really leaped out at me here. A lot of money for a little music.
2,Something New Would be Preferable,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Dark Horse and all, but George: How's about coming out with something new instead of remastering 30 year old songs! My Sweet Lord 2000 is about as memorable as the Blues Brothers 2000. In other words, if you already have this album don't waste your money buying it again. I'ts time for us as music fans to stand up and say no to record company attempts to divest us of funds for albums we already own. When George comes out with something new, buy that. In the meantime just say Pass."
3,solid,Yagh this is definatly the best album put out by Goerge in his solo career. I just wish on the song my sweet Lord he was sining about Jesus and not Krishna. Geroge is a grreat guitarist and his career with the Beatles is far better than anything solo. GodBless
1,My Sweet Lord and a bunch of B sides,"The star is for ""My Sweet Lord"", a good song. He always was good for a song or two per album. It would've been nice if the rest of these songs had been written (or more importantly sung) by real artists like John or even Paul. Sadly, George is in control here. Most people know the jams are a joke. At least they're a joke you don't have to hear in George singing voice. The Beatles were the greatest band of all time. The solo Beatles were great sometimes. Try Plastic Ono Band, Imagine, Milk And Honey, Double Fantasy. In that order. P.S. BOYCOTT REMASTERS!"
4,Best from GH,"It was a long time ago since I heard this one, but due to the remastering it sounds als music from today. The man was better than many people thougt"
4,"REMIX ,PLEASE!","I like it, but it badly needs re-mixing. I won't buy the CD until it's re-mastered. What the hell was Spector doing with all of the buring of melody and instruments with horns and mush? Kills some of the melodies."
5,"If you buy anything by Harrison, buy this...","In 1970, Harrison released his first and most brilliant solo album, All Things Must Pass. If you buy anything by George Harrison, buy this! Nearly every song is worth listening to, some of the best including ""My Sweet Lord,"" ""Isn't It A Pity,"" ""What Is Life,"" ""All Things Must Pass,"" and ""Hear Me Lord."" In the special remastered edition, a total of ten tracks -- 5 bonus tracks and 5 original jam tracks -- were added, making the collection even more worth it.Even though George was ""the quiet one,"" his solo debut crushed the debuts of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and this album proves that leaving the Beatles made his amazing song-writing ability even stronger."
5,Great double disc set,"This was the disc that made George Harrison my favorite Beatle. The last few years they were together, he had to fight to get one or two of his songs on each album. The good news about this was that he had all these great songs ready after they split up. This collection gives us everything from ""My Sweet Lord"" to ""It's Johnny's Birthday"" and it's all good.Of all the solo discs by the ex-Beatles, this is easily my favorite. The only others ones that come close are ""Living in the Material World,"" also by George and John Lennon's ""Rock and Roll."""
2,Poor Remaster - Sound is 2nd rate,"Not sure what happened here on the remaster. Most of the album sounds veiled and not full dynamics. Bordering on dostortion. Quite a let down given the fine songs and monumental album it is. Audiophiles will not be happy here. The only song with a reasonable playback quality is ""My Sweet Lord"" the second take.Nothing new about poor quality recordings. It takes some money to do it right, some care, and ""they"" have to be more responsible. What a shame....."
4,Not a great picture album.,This book should work well to organize family history data. I took off a star because I would have liked more room for pictures when writing about each relative. There are a few picture pages in the back.
5,My family tree book.,I was looking for more copies of this hardcover book to continue doing my family history. I found it here and I very satisfied!
1,Blasphemy!,"Unfortunately, I can't comment on the quality of the stories in this anthology, since I couldn't even get through the introduction. I'll admit I'm not a fan of Robert M. Price to begin with, but the things he wrote in this introduction can only be describe as blasphemous, and I use that in the traditional religious context. Therefore, if you are a Christian and a fan of Lovecraftian fiction, I would recommend avoiding this book."
4,Harmonizer,Haven't used to any extent. Only tried once at this point and it produces some harmony that will be fun to try. I did notice that it picked up the guitar and caused it to echo a bit.
1,Buyer Beware,I was looking for bulk pixie stix in little packages to give out for halloween. The picture shows a box of individual packages which is what I thought I was getting. What I received was a tiny bag of 48 individual little pixie sticks. I can pick up a bag at the store here for a couple of bucks. Very misleading (and I'm sure deliberately misleading) picture.
1,Seriously?,As other reviews have stated this is an awful deal. When I initially purchased this product the picture showed what I had intended to purchase which is 48 individually wrapped packets of 3 pixy stix. Very upset with this purchase.
4,Messy but good,"Grew up with Pixy Stix in the 70's. Just as sweet as back then, and still as messy. Little kids loved them, but be willing to clean up spilled sugar powder."
3,Great cover but hardly worth the price,"A great cover and a worthy collection of Lennon's solo ""hits,"" but hardly worth the price considering that all but two of the tracks (""Mother"" and ""Woman is the Nigger of the World"") are also available on ""The John Lennon Collection"" along with the complete version of ""Give Peace a Chance"" and ten other classics, including ""Watching the Wheels"" and his wonderful rendition of ""Stand By Me."" Still, that cover is impressive, as is the quote (on the back cover of the original lp, anyway) from Dr. Winston O' Boogie: ""A conspiracy of silence speaks louder than words."""
2,Early Greatest Hits Now Outdated,"This collection was the cream of his work up to 1975 but has since been supplanted by Lennon Collection and Lennon Legend, which cover his work up to the end and are more generous with playing time. Give Peace A Chance is presented in an edited form. This is good music but this good music can be found in better contexts elsewhere."
2,Pretty weak. Disappointing.,"Less an album than a hodge-podge of Lennon tunes thrown together for a quick buck. Although I sometimes listen to it, I am repeatedly let down by its lack of cohesion or sense. After purchasing this, I felt used."
2,Overpriced,"I find it kind of curious that anyone who advertises any of the six OCP 'Hi God!' CD series at a discount from its list $17 price ($20 for #6) is unable to supply them. The content of any one of the CDs is fine. However, I don't find it one bit better than any of dozens of other Christian children's CDs. So, I'd say they are at least double over-priced when compared to other Christian children's music CDs. [For example, for $19.95 you can get a 5-disc set, with 192 Christian songs, from Cedarmont Kids. How long do you think your kids would take to get bored with the 17 songs on 'Hi God! 6' compared to 192 songs?]"
3,This book was ok...,"I'm sorry but I have read better. R.A. Torrey's, 'How To Pray' is THE guide to prayer and also just 100 pages long. Read it instead. Sorry Bruce and Stan."
3,Olivella Bar,"Since I, like most people, suffer from dry skin in the winter, I decided to try an olive soap. It does leave your skin squeeky clean with no soap scum residue. The bar last a long time too. However, I still feel like I need to apply a moisturizer after. I was hoping to eliminate that need. I may try Olivella's moisturizer.I would recommend this soap but you may want to consider adding the moisturizer to your cart too!"
2,DISSAPOINTED!!,"I was sadly dissapointed in the product,certainly did not live up to all the hype. I would say it is a bit better than your basic store brand bar soap. Certainly did not do anything to help my dry skin.I would tell you to stay with your present soap and just purchase a good moisturizer."
1,I have to give this a star?,This product contians LYE... so much for the benifits of olive oil. It leaves your skin feeling dry and itchy.Now I remember why I stopped buying things on the internet.
1,cumbersone inconsistent bends,"The problem with this type of sheet metal brake is buckling in the center section of the hold down bar, especially when bending heavier gauge metal. The result is that the bend in the middle of the sheet metal being bent isn't consistent with the angle of the firmly clamped down ends. While fairly easy to clamp down the ends of the hold down bar for making a bend there's no way to reliably clamp down the center section without the clamp(s) getting in the way of metal that protrudes much more than a few inches (at most) from the front of the bender. Bending flanges and/or material extending out the front a few inches, etc., might work out ok with center positioned clamps that have an extended throat section to them."
1,awkward and chinsey,this break is very awkward to use and does not fold anything heavier than roof flashing i was very disapointed
3,Will the Circle Be Unbroken,"Part I has some good stuff on it- not the number or quality of volume II, but still some good bluegrass music."
5,None can compare,"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BLUEGRASS ALBUM EVER RECORDED, PERIOD!! IF YOU CAN ONLY OWN ONE BLUEGRASS/COUNTRY ALBUM. THIS IS IT!"
5,Great decals,Love these. The are printed on clear material and you cannot see the edgging around the pictures as some do. Great size as well.
2,Only the dial is worth it - throw away the cheap plastic band.,"Cheap cheap cheap plastic band.The dial was beautiful for the price though. Throw the band away, put on another better one and you should be okay.But wait... you can't replace the band. Its indispensable.I don't recommend buying this unless you get it for sports so the sweat won't malign your wrist band."
2,Stylish and unreadable,"Nice looking watch, but the face is very hard to read. Day and hour settings are virtually impossible to set accurately. Watch hands are nearly invisible against the face. I returned this item."
1,Late 60's Afro Hustle?,"I love disco and salsa music and even though I couldn't hear samples I decided to take a chance. The only song that might pass as ""Latin Disco"" was the first track ""Corazon"" with spanish being horribly croaked out by someone desperately in need of singing lessons. Anyone want to buy a once played CD for half what I paid for it?"
3,A Prom That's Not To Be Missed,"The Prom's sophomore full-length release, `Under The Same Stars', begins with an elegiac instrumental introduction before venturing into traditional piano-based indie pop. 2001 saw the band opening for acts like Rainer Maria, Bright Eyes, and Death Cab For Cutie on their respective national tours, and 2002 will feature the threesome headlining their own club tour. Lyrically, the band prefers prose to poetry with each of their songs reading like a teenage Dear John letter. Standout tracks are ""Ink On The Paper"" replete with its own flute solo, ""The City Gets Lonely,"" and ""Room With White Walls."" If you can't afford Ben Folds' ever-rising ticket prices, try going to The Prom."
2,Wires,Shorts out to quickly...owned many never last long..I have found that the cord connected the the iron some how shorts out over a few months
4,crunchy,"Some great raunch 'n' roll by the Gun Club on this fine album. I always liked this one even more than the more acclaimed ""Fire of Love."" Just something about the spirit of the songs and Jeffrey Lee Pierce's emotive and tortured vocals really captivated me. when he yells ""Daddy's dead on the lawn"" you can picture the carcass there on the grass. Vivid stuff. The bonus disc of live material is good but not something I'll go back and listen to very often. But the original album is a definite must listen."
4,Not Fire of Love but Still Good,"The Gun Club simply never regained the heights they hit on the Fire of Love album. That combo of punk rock meets rockabilly meets swampy blues is one of the best records of its kind, up there with the best stuff the Cramps did. But if you're looking for a second Gun Club album to listen to, this one is worthwhile. ""Texas Serenade"" is one of their best tracks, the song ""Fire of Love"" could've been on that album, and ""Brother and Sister"" is a feisty rocker with a cool riff. But the cover of CCR's ""Run Through the Jungle,"" a perfect song for the Gun Club to play, falls flat, as do several of the other tracks. Can't help but think the absence of Kid Congo Powers took some of the bite out of the band here. If you're looking for one Gun Club album to get, go straight to Fire of Love. If you've got that one and love it and want a second one, try this."
2,faulty advertising!!!!!!,"This item states its a kit when in reality its only one side of the kit, you must purchase two of these, when I returned the item for my refund they told me it wouldn't take more then 30 days to receive it, so far its been 27days and still no refund, I am highly upset I don't think I will ever purchase from Amazon.com again. Buyers beware."
3,Disappointing,"The 225 Life Skills was not what I had hoped for. I found it to be dull and disappointing. I could not stay focused on the topics. Perhaps it was the writing style, but in any case, I couldn't get through it...I stopped a third of the way in."
5,Great lesson about sibling jealousy that 2-5 year olds and up will enjoy,My daughters 2 and 5 really enjoy this book. My older daughter likes books with more substance and situations that an older child might encounter. My younger daughter also has the patience to listen. This story about jealousy struck a chord with my daughters.
3,a girl with dreams...,"Kate just got new skates from her grandmother. She is very excited about going to the ice rink to skate. Her little sister Jane can skate, but Kate cannot. Kate is embarrassed because people are laughing at her falling. One day she wants to skate as well as Diana Lin, a famous figure skater. One day, Kate sees Diana Lin at the ice rink. Diana Lin teaches Kate how to skate, and she gets better.I like this book because a girl has a dream to learn how to skate. She accomplishes her dream even though people laugh at her, and she becomes better at skating. I can relate to Kate, because I am the oldest and I have a younger sister. My little sister can ice skate, but I can't. Of course, there are other things I can do that my sister can't, but I find it a little embarrassing if I cannot do something my sister can."
4,I like it,The compartment pill boxes are cute and useful. The colors and day labels make it easy to keep up with my prescriptions. I would have 5-starred the product if the pill boxes fit into the pill box holder tighter.
5,Just what I wanted,"We had purchased a Corelle Impressions set several years ago and slowly, but surely the bowls were getting dropped enough and broken that they were getting in short supply. These were just what we needed. Not only did we fill in our 'set', but we got extras in case any more get dropped and break."
4,great source of original sources for stories,I was happy to get this book because it has excerpts from the original and often first hand accounts of pirate stories.
3,Somewhat of a bargain,These blinds cost less than any other blinds of the size I could find anywhere. They seem to function all right and block out enough light and glare when needed.
1,Too many Spanish errors!,"I bought this book for my young son, because I'd like him to grow up bilingual, as I did. I couldn't believe that there were 3 glaring errors in the Spanish parts: berenjena (eggplant) is misspelled as beranjena, remolacha (beet) is misspelled as remolocha, and pingüinos (penguins) is misspelled as pengüinos. 3 errors in just 26 pages, with just a couple of words per page? Did no one proofread the Spanish? I have just 2 words for the authors: ¡qué vergüenza! Look it up."
4,My son loves this book!,"It looks like someone picked up on all but one spelling mistake, so I would give this book higher marks than the other reviewer. This little book has cute kids wearing different colored clothes on each board/page. The photos are all very attractive. The book has held up well to plenty of use by my son. This is a good addition to a bilingual library for toddlers. The pronunciation table in the back is a very helpful resource for English-speaking parents who want to teach their children the correct pronunciation for new words."
1,"So, does it work?","I bought two of these, because I don't have a range right now, and thought it might be nice to cook. Well, not with these.Set on high, the heating element reaches searing heat fairly quickly, and then turns off. As a result, you're left waiting indefinately while the thing decides to turn on again. You can really burn some bacon with it, if you have all day.Case in point, I wrote this review while waiting for the thing to turn back on."
1,Buyer WARNING!,"Many reviews vary on John's Walls And Bridges but i must rate this one 0 or 1 stars. The ORIGINAL album is great but this remastered version is horrible. Yoko Ono has changed the album by taking the Apple Co. logo off the inside of the album. This was recorded while John Lennon was dating May Pang and suddenly one of the songs he wrote about loving May now has the words ""Yo-Ko"" chanting in the background. The most signifigant and disturbing alteration to this album is the removal of John Lennon's art from the cover. He used to have one of his original drawings on the cover but Yoko removed it. She also appointed herself as producer. WARNING! Walls And Bridges is a stellar stellar album but the original is better. The original was made by John Lennon and approved by him. Buy the colorful copy with John's artwork on it not the one with him and 4 sunglasses! Good Luck Buying."
5,Easily His best solo effort!,"Great Lennon album here. Many classics such as Whatever Gets You through the night,Surprise Surprise,and my favorite Lennon solo track #9 Dream. This is a must get for fans. Buy It!"
2,Not his finest moment...,"Hey, I think Lennon was brilliant, but let's face it - of his solo records, only Plastic Ono Band and Imagine are classics. Hate to say it, but the critics were right this time. I thought this and Mind Games were great when I was 12, but now in my mid-forties ... not so much. This stuff is simply boring. Five-star? No way."
3,ok but I prefer Macca,"Some really nice tunes on here. #9 Dream is as good as anything Lennon ever wrote, but there are weak songs on here, namely 'whatever gets you through the night', which to me is a rambling, tuneless dirge and the awful 'ya ya'. Also 'what you got' is abslutely horrible. Still, worthy of a purchase, as there are a lot of melodic songs here, but I think Macca was better, particularly with his strong and more characteristic 'Venus and Mars' out around this time."
1,Johnny we hardy knew ye,"This album proves that John may have very well been the most over rated Beatle. ""Whatever gets you through the night"" is one of the worst songs he ever recorded-God only knows how it ever became a hit-perhaps it was some cosmic dawning of disco consciousness. I'd rather listen to ""Who has seen the wind""!!! I once thought this was his absolute worst album-not counting garbage like ""Two Virgins"" and other unfinished music--but then he came out of retirement with ""Double Fantasy"" and ""Menlove Avenue"" Maybe we should have all been looking for clues on the Beatle albums that John was dead instead of Paul. How the mighty are fallen..."
4,John Lennon,"I haven't really been a real fan of John Lennon's work. To tell you the truth I enjoy George Harrison's solo work a little bit more because it's a little different. My sister was the one who told me to listen to some of Lennon's solo work. Now I have always loved his work with the Beatles. I have listened to the album ""Imagine"" and thought it was alright, it was an over-rated album in my opinion. I have listened to every Lennon album out there and this is by far my favorite and his best work. I think the song ""Steel Glass"" sounds a little to much like ""How do you sleep"". Overall, it's an awesome album I don't think there's a song on here I don't like. Another good album is ""Mind Games"" I enjoyed that as well. Yay for John!"
3,correction,THIS ALBUM WAS RECORDED IN NEW YORK AFTER JOHN HAD SOBERED UP FROM THE LOST WEEKEND. NOT LOS ANGELES.
3,Sad John,"This album was made during Lennon's worst year. The songs lack any organization and production except for one track. #9 Dream is a beautiful song and almost worth the price of the cd. Still as a true Lennon Fan, I chalk this album up to Yoko's effect on Lennon during the making of this album."
2,"Oh, No! Stop Ono!","Yoko Ono lists herself as the PRODUCER of this CD?John was with May Pang when he recorded this, giving him his first solo #1 hit, ""Whatever Gets You Through the Night.""But I guess that explains why this edition has Yoko's giant fingerprints all over it, including the addition of either her or John singing her name at the end of a song--that wasn't about her in the first place.At this rate, someone's going to have to apologize to Albert Goldman...."
2,Expensive,"First off: The music sounds great. Upgrade over the original Walls on CD.Secondly: A perfect example of record company greed.No CD front cover insert, cost $20.99 in local store (which I admit was a mistake - if you NEED it - get it here). There is no way considering the manner this CD is packaged that the cost should be this high. The recording costs were incurred in 74 or thereabouts and have long since been recouped. I can get a disc and a blank jewel case for under $.50 cents.This CD (remastered and all) should be priced at a minimum of half the existing cost. Every record company that does this just isn't getting the picture."
4,Spooky Lennon Release,"This album is spooky. Some of the songs have an almost twilight mood to them...Number 9 Dream and Steel and Glass. I never heard the song Steel and Glass until a few days after Lennon was murdered, so I guess it brings that creepy feeling back to me. But each song seems to have dark undertones. Scared includes the lyric 'hated and jealously are going to be the death of me.' I love this album, but the lyrics always cause you to think of his demise. Sad."
4,portrait of the artist as a craftsman...,"To say that this is a great album would not be a overstatement. By a lesser force than Lennon it would be a career high point, as it is, it's a polished portrait that doesn't ring as true as Lennon's best work but is excellent pop nonetheless. Any album that contains ""#9 Dream"", which showcases one of the most evocative arrangements of any Lennon song, can't be all bad. ""Old Dirt Road"", co-written with Harry Nilsson, is another high point. The album is lushly produced, with interesting orchestration throughout. The band is not to be believed...check out ""Bless You"", a top-notch ballad. It lacks the Beatle touch but this is a fine album from John, even if it smacks of ""form over content""...just a bit. A worthwhile purchase."
4,"Yes to Lennon remixed, remastered, O-no to the packaging","A lovely CD restored to sonic clarity... from John's 'lost weekeend' period. He's Sooohonest, melodic and inventive. Lyrically he's emotionally generous (""Bless You"")resigned (""Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out"""") self aware the 'Hatred and jealousy' section of ""Scared"") and what was a bit of a dull, murky original mix and pressing is now pristine. Bless Yoko for her stewardship of his aural catalogue but both of my thumbs down for her repackaging -- losing John's orignal cover of childhood drawings, and the disk graphics are maybe a bit misleading/self serving (John and Yoko's faces morphing, originally from the Sometime In NYC record; butthis was the lost weekend, and May Pang was in the picture as well.)"
4,has it's own place...,"This is a much better produced album than Mind Games, but, other than #9 Dream, lacks a truly memorable melody. The increased subtly and clarity of the production help to make up for the lack of melody and harmony, and thus make a much more listenable album than Mind Games. But Mind Games has better songs. Check out I Know, One Day at a Time, Ausimasen (I'm Sorry), Intuition, Out the Blue and even Mind Games. The problem is the muddy mix and cluttered arrangements that get in the way of the songs. Walls and Bridges solves that problem, but the songs seem more pedestrian, except for the wonderful #9 Dream, which is classic Lennon."
2,useless,"I bought it for a class and we never used the book. A few times we used the Appendixes in the back, but for the tests she printed those out for us, so I could've easily gone the entire semester with out this. I only give 2 stars because the problem doesn't lie entirely with the book and Amazon, of course - it's my teacher and my school that required a book we didn't need! :("
4,The Carpenters is not the same without Keren Carpenter.,"This remake of the Carpenters songs is still beautiful. However, despite Richard's skillful arrangement and piano playing, this album can't still measure up to the old carpenters' album. One thing that definitely is missed from this album is Karen's angelic voice. I don't think that Richard's Piano melody can substitute Keren Carpenter's singing.."
3,Great Item,"I like the cd, but I only know a couple of songs off it. The reason I purchased the cd is the song Say, Say, Say, which is an excellent song! I think it is great Paul paired up with Micheal and made such a wonderful song."
3,Redundant hits re-packaging,"Judging the material alone, it would rate 5 stars. But this is merely a redundant update of the Wings Greatest CD. The best thing here that you don't get there is the live ""Coming Up""-- but the opportunity to make this a PART TWO for those who already had the earlier compilation was missed. This was a mis-conceived set, and a lot of choice material (i.e., minor hits, b-sides) was left off in favor of re-issueing the same tracks again. No wonder it sold poorly."
1,POINTLESS spend a couple more bucks and buy WINGSPAN,"Why in the world would anyone buy this single disc bare bones ""best of"" collection when, for just a dollar or two more, you could buy the double disc WINGSPAN? It's baffling to me why this is still in print. Unless you're really jonesin' for ""Say, Say, Say"" and a nice black and white pic of Macca with his Rickenbacher, buy WINGSPAN and you'll have the essential 70's and early 80's McCartney."
3,Not his BEST work,"This is a collection of Macca's greatest hits -- and nothing more than that. It definitely isn't his BEST work, as the title suggests. Although the album does contain some of his greatest songs (like ""Band on the Run""), the real gems were left out. This was the first McCartney CD I got, and while I did like most of the songs on it, it didn't really make me want to hear more of his work. Luckily, the next CD I heard was ""Flaming Pie"", and I was blown away. So, if all you want are Macca's hit singles, this is probably the CD to get; but if you're seriously interested in his solo career, you should check out some of his other albums. ""Flaming Pie"", ""Tug of War"" or ""Band on the Run"" are probably good places to start."
3,Nice Collection But A Missed Opportunity,"This is an adequate collection, but it is a missed opportunity to include some lesser known songs or songs that are not already on WINGS GREATEST. Ten of the songs found on this collection can already be found on WINGS GREATEST, so it is redundant. I wish it would include songs like ""Maybe I'm Amazed (Live), ""Venus And Mars/Rock Show"", ""Every Night"", ""Back Seat Of My Car"", ""Sally G"", ""Here Today"" (just to name a few). Interestingly, my two favorite songs on WINGS GREATEST are missing (""Hi Hi Hi"" and ""Mull of Kintyre""). What I do like about this collection, however, is it has three songs that I have not been able to find anywhere else (""Coming Up(Live)"", ""Goodnight Tonight"", and ""C Moon""). Not bad, but a missed opportunity for rarities, lesser hits, B sides, and songs not already found on WINGS GREATEST."
5,saladgirl,Great songs of a master. Saw him in concert a year or so ago and started looking to replace some of my McCartney vinyl with CDs. This is a must if you like McCartney
3,Not McCartney's Best!,"I must admit, in listening to this album, I was disappointed in Paul's choices for his ""greatest hits"". Out of these 17 songs, only about half of them are worthy of being considered for a greatest hits album. Many of Paul's best solo songs were left off this album, such as ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", ""Too Many People"", ""The Back Seat of My Car"", ""Big Barn Bed"", ""Mull Of Kintyre"", ""Hi Hi Hi"", ""Helen Wheels"", and ""Give Ireland Back To The Irish"". Had Paul honestly picked his best songs, the album would have turned out like this:1. Maybe I'm Amazed 2. Too Many People 3. The Back Seat Of My Car 4. Give Ireland Back To The Irish 5. C-Moon 6. My Love 7. Big Barn Bed 8. Live And Let Die 9. Jet 10. Band On The Run 11. Venus And Mars/Rock Show 12. Junior's Farm 13. Mull Of Kintyre 14. With A Little LuckThat's what ""All The Best"" should consist of!!!"
4,Pretty Good,"Good CD on the whole. Though I would like any CD with Live and Let Die on it. But is it just me, or is Coming Up the worst Paul McCartney song ever recorded? It's like fingernails on a chalkboard to me. Ebony and Ivory is awful tired and seems to come off as some form of pandering, though don't ask me to what. Take those two dreadful songs out and you have a solid CD."
3,"Not ""ALL THE BEST""","I finally have listened to the entire c.d and am somewhat disappointed. When I just listened to the ""hits"" that I actually know and like, is when I liked this album. It really is very disappointing about three quarters of the way through. I always skip over these, tracks 11 through 13 are boring! and I have never liked ""No more Lonely Nights""..that is another Mccartney dud in my opinion.I've always been a huge fan of the Beatles, and like most of the music from Wings'. Some of the choices as the best here, just aren't the best in my opinion.One is better off listening to Beatles records for his truly best work. His solo efforts are just not the same.He still is one of the most talented musicians out there..and he did a great job at Superbowl halftime.I did like most of the album ..it's worth buying for the real hits."
4,They Could Make This CD Perfect By...,"They could make this CD perfect by removing the songs ""C Moon"" and ""Junior's Farm"" and then adding the songs ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" & ""Take It Away"". Then after that they should digitally remaster it in modern terms and re-release it. If they did this it would be a perfect compilation. So do it. Do it now!"
4,Maybe I'm Almost Amazed,"WHERE IS MAYBE I'M AMAZED? This song is one of McCartney's top 5 and one of any post-Beatles songs by any Beatles members. Other than that, everything is here. Say Say Say, Mull of Kintyre, Band on the Run, Live and Let Die, etc."
2,"Let it be, to juniors farm?","These songs cannot compare to his work with the Beatles, none of them! Its like a college grad goes back to 8th grade, catchy tunes? sure, pure fluff to say the least!"
5,Paul McCartney is the best!,Paul McCartney is the best and this compilation of his music is absolutely wonderful. I love every minute of listening to it.
5,great songs,"i highly enjoy this man's talent.he is a solid bass player and of course one of the greatest song-writers ever.this disc has many great songs such as say say say with michael jackson coming up,live and let die among others.he is a very talented artist."
5,Generous Serving Of Paul and Linda,A very full length CD of the McCartney's greatest work. Goes over a lot of the same territory as Wings' Greatest but take it a step further. Worthy of following the Beatles.
5,great ironic documentary,"this is the best documentary i saw this year. it has a lot to say about a lot of things: hollywood, celebrity, the iraq war, America, filmmaking, and human nature. and it is very well made, self-conscious, and funny."
5,Must have for recycling education,"This is an amazing book. It covers the major groups of recyclables. It shares facts, tells children how to prepare each item to recycle, and gives a comprehendable description of how they are made into new products. At the end it even gives children ideas of how they can help."
3,Great book for older kids,This book is full of facts and figures to demonstrate just how damaging some of the products we use every day can be to our environment. The information regarding the biodegradability of every day products will really make a person think about what they use and how they dispose of it.
3,Pretty good book,"While this book isn't the best I've found, it does have information a lot of other books don't have. It's a little hard for some younger learners to read as it has words like ""bauxite"" and ""silica"" but gives a pretty good background on renewable and non-renewable resources that go into your everyday products (glass, metal, paper, etc). The illustrations might be the best part of the book - as an informal educator with a non-profit organization, I mostly use this book for the pictures."
4,Great book for kids,This was a great book. I enjoyed it and also purchased one as a gift for a friend. I would reccommend it.
4,Lots of good facts.,This book had a lot of good factual information in it about recycling. We read about recycling for Health this week. This book had great information about what is done with the things we recycle and how to reduce using those items that can't be recycled. I would recommend it for grades 2-4th.
4,Very informative and entertaining.,This book does a wonderful job explaining exactly how an item gets recycled. Its thought provoking and entertaining. The illustrations are wonderful.
3,Not Really A Sweater,"I bought 3 of these at $4.90 each on a Friday Sale, so I can't really complain. But I would call them t-shirts, not sweaters, as they're very thin. They also can't be machine-dried, which is inconvenient. Good quality t-shirt, though."
4,Bill Blass Sweater,fantastic value at $4.90 friday sale! I wish I would have purchased more. The quality is great and it washes up nice.
4,Good quality but runs big,This is more like a t-shirt. But it is very soft and the colors are as depicted online. They run big though. Get one size smaller unless you like very loose fitting clothing.
3,High school girls,An appropriate story for female teenagers. A good example of very commonissues and emotions that many high school girls deal with. A little bit old fashioned so some older women would enjoy this read to bring back memories from their own childhoods.
2,HIM who???,"Frighteningly forgettable. Nothing to hate here, nothing to love. No emotional response is evoked at all by this unremarkable CD. This was my first real listen to HIM and will be my last."
1,AVOID,"This was our first ever Hot Wheels purchase and it will definitely be the last. The quality of the product is atrocious. It is extremely difficult to put the parts together, even for an adult, and everything falls apart again within minutes which leads to a great deal of frustration. I have never bought such an appallingly bad product in the 5 years that I have been buying toys and games for my son. Do not waste your money on this or any other Hot Wheels product."
2,Do Not Waste Your Money!!!,"My son is very big into Hot Wheels and wanted Turbo Jet City for Christmas. What a disapointment. It is very large so you better have somewhere to put it. It has about a million stickers that don't stay on very well. The helicopter never stays in place. The airplanes wings brake very easy. Not to mention that the little place do not stay in place. I exchanged it about a week after Christmas, because everything was braking and the called Hot Wheels and they sent a third one, but I'll tell you all three on them kept braking. I wish Hot Wheels would come up with a toy that is durable and fun for the kids to play with."
2,has very bad unstructions for assembly.,the manual just gives a picture with the toy assembled.will never buy anything from mattel again.
2,Looks cool but won't last,"My 5-year-old had to have this last Christmas. It's impossible to keep all the pieces together, breaks easily and can't be put back together quickly. Plus, it takes up a lot of room--especially for a toy that doesn't get played with. Fun when it worked but even my kid doesn't think it's worth the effort."
3,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK, Did I mention JUNK!!","If you like messey, a toy that break if you look at it,and parts everywhere where they do not stay on; than this is the toy for you. This was the toy my son was SO excited to getfor Christmas. He has not played with it once. It is a waste of money. It has so many pieces that will NOT and I mean NOT stay on. IT is just horrible. My son has even said he doesn't like it where it is to messy. It's pieces all over the track and when the cars go on the track the track falls off. It is not a toy that you would want. All you do is step on pieces. We have my son's on a shelf with all the pieces pilled on top. Great place for a [$] toy. BEWARE!!!!!!!!"
2,Expensive Disappointment,"This is the first (and last) HotWheels toy I buy for my 4 year old son. He was really excited about it so he got it for Christmas (in spite of the ... price tag). It took close to an hour to assemble and I don't think I ever finished putting the 100 or so stickers on it....First launch out of the box, and the styrofoam wing broke off of the plane. I'd have given it a higher ""fun"" rating if it were not constantly falling apart because my son does enjoy playing with it. He just needs me to constantly come over and fix something that has fallen apart. Unfortunately, this is not the only toy this Christmas that we had such problems with. I find it disgusting that companies can get away with such shoddy workmanship."
4,For [$$] they should put the decals on!!,"Geez, Takes about thirty minutes to assemble and place all the decals on the product.I agree, the helicopter, does NOT stay in place. The styrofoam is broken already, and their web site states no replacement parts for this product.Way to go Hotwheels, thanks for making this product of the highest quality.....Geez, you should be ashamed!!"
2,Just OK,"This toy is a booger to put together. Once it is together you cannot move it easily, all of the parts need reassembling. My almost 4-year old was initially very excited; however his enthusiasm quickly wore off. Not a great choice, he enjoys driving his cars off the couch more then this."
3,Another low quality toy from Hot Wheels,"This toy is actually fairly fun, it's a shame that it continually falls apart just from normal use. It's almost impossible to keep it in one piece. I'd have thought that they would figure out how to make the pieces stay together."
2,A total waste of time and money!,"My son loved the ""idea"" of this toy, had to have it for Christmas. My husband and I spent a huge amount of time trying to assemble it and it broke almost immediately. They cried and were frustrated. It is also very large to store and doesn't disassemble easily (except by the breaking). I won't be purchasing another item from this company!"
3,Get the glue ready,"Hot Wheels toys are notorious for falling apart and Turbo Jet City is no exception. Be prepared to glue, and re-glue the plane back together since it is made of foam and even mild play will cause the wings to break off. Also, set it up in a spot where you won't have to move it because any movement causes it to come apart. There are numerous parts that will eventually get lost under the sofa, or worse, you'll find them by stepping on them in your bare feet.Don't buy it for your 3-year-old. Having it fall apart and the plane breaking so often will be extremely frustrating for a child who is not old enough to participate in the re-building or re-glueing process. For 5-year-olds and older, that might be part of the fun."
2,Slightly Disappointed,"My boys (5 & 2) really liked this toy but we had a lot of trouble keeping it put together. The wings on the styrofoam plane broke rather easily. At the discount price this toy is a buy. But at the full price I paid last Christmas, I'm disappointed in the durability & assembly."
3,Turbo Jet City,"The kids love this toy. However, it was difficult to assembly and the jet is really flimsy and broke the third day. Moreover, Mattel does not have replacement parts for this set."
1,Dont' waste your money,"This was given to our son as a gift. Once all of the pieces are put together, some of them do not stay together. Some of the so-called functioning parts never worked right even when everything was set up properly. My son lost interest in it VERY quickly."
2,waste of money,My 4yr. old son wanted this so badddd!!!!. What a waste of money. Very expensive toy that does not stay together. Air plane with foam wings broke first launch off pad! Helicopter does not stay in place! I have nothing good to say about this toy. HotWheels failed with this one!
1,Definitely NOT not one of Hot Wheels 10 best!,"This toy was VERY hard to assemble and constantly falls apart (even when not moved). The helicopter is very hard for a child to operate (in the way it was intended). The airplane is extremely fragile too. My son was very disappointed in the Turbo Jet City. We have returned it. Very bad design. The Hot Wheels ""Octoblast"" is a MUCH better choice."
2,another piece of plastic,"My son has too many hotwheels and matchbox cars! I've spent too much money on useless junk. This would be one of the items. It had 75 decals and the first time he play with it the sticker on the plane started to curl(please note that this sticker was one of the few decals that was pre-applied). After over an hour of assembly the item was done, and I mean that literally. Please don't buy this, if you have to buy anything for your little car fan you should consider the matchbox rescue carwash. It takes a severe beating without falling apart. Michelle"
2,Skip This Toy,"Once again Hot Wheels has designed another toy set that doesn't work as well as it is supposed to and is difficult to assemble. My 4 1/2 year old wanted this set for several months. He has played with it twice since getting it. The plane broke almost immediatedly (it is made of styrofoam), the helocopter has never stayed in place, and he has become disenchanted with it. My suggestion is to skip this set and try another one with fewer moving parts."
2,DANGEROUS!,"NOT ONLY WAS THIS TOY A PAIN TO ASSEMBLE, BUT ONCE THE CARS AND AIRPLANES STARTED FLYING, WE ALL HAD TO RUN FOR COVER! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TOY FOR ANY CHILD! THE JET AIRPLANE TAKES OFF WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. AFTER IT HIT MY SON IN THE FACE, WE PUT IN ALL IN A HEFTY BAG TO BE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER. IF THERE IS ANY TOY THAT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED FOR SAFETY REASON, IT'S THIS ONE."
1,Not what it seems!,This toy is very commercialized. It is not what it is made out to be. A waste of money. I would rather spend 38.88 (cheapest price I could find on it) and buy my son another remote control car than purchase this time consuming toy. The stickers are around 50 of them and it took forever to set up! Pieces keep falling off the parts and it just isn't as enticing as the commercial is. Very dissappointed!
4,Last cover girls CD is not too bad all around!!,"Okay, I had been searching for this CD for a long time and finally located it up here on amazon. Got ahold of it and I can say it was worth the wait for the most part, sadly though there is actually only one cover girl left and I believe this album was yanked shortly after release for not doing too well. Solid housy music here is pretty good with several remakes, seems all dance CD's nowadays have at least one remake. I must say though that halfway through it kinda looses steam and sounds very dated from I say track six on, however you freestyle/house/dance junkies like me should try to get ahold of this CD strictly for it's rarity. A good solid purchase all around"
2,Beware - Wrong Version,"I could be wrong, but I do not see the version number listed on this product. I ordered this software last week. What was shipped to me was version 1.1. When I installed it, I found that there was a new version (2.0) that would cost me $10 more to upgrade. I wrote to the company (Boinx), but to no avail.I have not used this product yet, so I can not comment about its functioning."
5,Wonderful book!,"This is one of the most encouraging books I've read in a long time. It's similar to Michael Newton's ""Journey of Souls"" but provides even more indepth information. It answers many questions that Christians often struggle with in dropping their lifetime concepts of ""Hell"" and ""Damnation"" and understanding how Jesus & salvation tie in with a ""Reincarnationist"" life view. This book definitely takes the fear out of death. I sent it to a friend of mine who is HIV positive, and it encouraged him so much and completely changed his outlook. It is an excellent book for the terminally ill."
3,A contemplation of the hereafter,This non-fiction account of numerous interviews held with people under hypnosis contains an interesting look at the possibility that there is something after death. There appears to be a general consensus among the subjects that there is a learning experience that takes place after death that helps prepare one for the next life beyond the present one. It is somewhat repetitive at times but still an interesting take on what is beyond the current reality that we know.
2,between death & life,"Disappointing read, the author repeats verse throughout and there is no flow to the script or structure..a feel good book that just did not work for me..."
2,Don't do it. Not worth the price!,"I got this razor for Christmas in '06 and was excited about all I had heard about it. It does do a good job of shaving close and not leaving razor burn or irritation. The problem comes when you use it for a few months and the trimmer starts to pop up while you are trying to shave. I eventually (after only 4 months) had to remove the trimmer. By 8 months the foils were breaking down and getting gashes in them, and I don't press very hard when shaving. I emailed Remington's customer service 3 weeks ago with this information and have gotten NO reply. I would at least expect them to replace this razor with a new one since their beard trimmer is defective and pops up every time I shave. NO response as of yet. Bottom line...it is far too expensive for this type of failure and lack of customer service."
1,Remington MS-5100 Review,"Remington does not present a true representation of this product on the box. Namely, this razor will NOT run while connected to an outlet. If the battery runs dead, you cannot shave. Please note the amazon representation above that there is a 5-minute reserve battery is also false. Both features, the 5-minute reserve and the running from cord feasibility are both true only for the more expensive MS-5200 series."
1,Not very durable,"When I first bought the Remington 5100 I was quite pleased - it cut well and gave me a smooth shave. However, it has this annoying habit of slicing through the foils after about 4 or 5 weeks. As it cuts through the foils it pretty much trashes the blades. I took it to a remington shop and I was told that this was ordinary wear - and so I can only report that Remington is not really very durable and is want of frequent part replacements. Good razor when its working but with a fairly high need for maintenance"
2,Do not purchase,This razor barely shaves my face. I shave every few days and my scruff is rarely very thick but this shaver fails to get it. I have to use it for over five minutes to get a good shave but I don't since that long irritates my face. With my old trifoil razor I got much better results.
2,There are better shavers out there for the $$,"I received this razor several years ago as a gift. It shaved well, but it recently broke. The latch that holds the shaver head on is merely a 2 thin ridges on each side that eventually wore out. I attempted to replace this part by calling Remington. They told me no fix is available, and I must purchase a new razor. The razor was perfectly good up until this happened. So I followed Remington's advice, and bought another razor, but NOT A REMINGTON! My new razor (Norelco) is much quieter and has a lithium battery. It shaves closer (I feel) and is more solidly constructed. This razor works well but has design flaws. There are better razors out there for the bucks."
2,loud and damages the skin on my neck,"A couple months after purchasing this remington ti ms5100, I noticed that it became painfull to shave. It feels like it is grinding the hair from my face and I dare not use it on my neck again. I had to switch back to my 2 year old panasonic that while low on power, it is quite quite sharp (atleast sharper than the remington) This is my first and last remington product. I just placed an order for a newer panasonic.Remington MS5100Pros: Powerful motor, close shave when used with lubricant or wet.Cons: Loud, dull blades, heavy, dry performance is not good."
4,Master View,If you are from the era of this music how could you not like it. It makes you think much about how music and society has changed.
4,Good movie.. Good plot.. Watch it!,Overall was a good movie.. I did not buy this movie because I felt once you have seen it I don't think you will see it again.. Don't get me wrong still a good movie.. Is about high school kids that have their summer vacation and they start dissapearing one by one.. I won't say too much about the movie because you I want you to see this movie.. Again I would rent it first before paying $15 or $10 bucks for it..
2,forgettable and unoriginal,"Oh, you will forget this very soon, since the concept is rather unoriginal, although some of the execution was not too bad."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I had been waiting a really long time to see this movie. It was an indie release that took almost 2 years to come out on DVD, but it finally did and I couldn't wait to see it. The reason is simple, the amazing young cast. I knew nothing of the writer, director, or story, but I saw that they got every up and coming young star in Hollywood to star in this thing and that alone should have made it a good film. Unfortunately the story is very very simple. It's not a bad movie per say, but it's just nothing different from a thousand other films in the genre. The cast was great, but the film was honestly just done. There was no surprises, nothing especially scary or violent, it was just a very simple and familiar film."
3,Strange,"I liked this movie. Not a whole lot of jump factors, but it has its scary moments. It took me a bit to catch on, but the story was really good. And the acting was believable. Not too bad. Rent it first and judge for yourself."
3,Hopscotch would have been a safer game to play,"It took a b-zillion short flashbacks before we came to the BIG reveal. The only problem with that......by that time I forget what the fuss was about.I must be the only one who has never heard of a game called Ghosts (or maybe we just didn't live close enough to a cemetery to play it?). It looked like a lame version of hide and seek to me; only no one took the trouble to hide. That they thought they could base a movie on such a slim thread of an idea is amazing. It seemed pretty pointless to include amnesia as a scare factor. If you don't remember something, it doesn't matter.It was nice seeing Barbara Bain again. Christopher Atkins' role though was a ""blink and you'll miss it"" type.Unimpressive but watchable, I'm not sorry I saw it this once; I just don't want to ever watch it again. Not a keeper."
1,1 star bag of garbage,Reading some of the reviews left me asking what movie did these people see that was so great certainly no this one.Acting poor and plot twist that left me askin wtf.Not scary poorly done waste of time
2,A sexual novel with just a little FemDom,"Imagine a society where women are in charge and men are trained to serve. That is the premise of this book but it does not deliver in the way of sexual female domination. There are some scenes where the main male character is disciplined by the 'women in charge' but most of the book is about his sexual power over women and how women can't resist him. That is not FemDom.The book also targets Christianity with many references to a female Savior and a female religious structure similar to the Catholic church. This may offend some people.I read the entire book and enjoyed it in spots. It is a sexual novel with a little FemDom but if FemDom is what you seek, this book will probably disappoint."
1,In HerService,This is the worse book I ever read. It is nothing like what the title describes. Don't waste your money on it.
4,How Cute Is This!,"This is one of the cutest bags that I have ever seen. It's so easy to match with your jeans or a pair of denim shoes. The unfoldable wallet is the coolest feature, it even has a little unbreakable mirror attached. It has slots where you can put your credit cards, metro cards, and your ID card."
5,soy diferente,"This album is great, like any other cd that I get when I like it I have to constantly play it. I have heard of India but never heard of her music. So when I was able to go to amazon.com and listen to the samples I just fell in love with her music and the way she sings. Anybody who purchases this I guarantee that you will enjoy and fall in love to."
2,More Producer-Driven Than Artist-Driven,"I think India is one of the most talented artists today. Her voice is sensational. Sadly, as with many great artists today, this album feels more producer/market-driven rather than artist-driven. I understand that Regaetton is popular right now. I would even understand including a few Reggaeton-flavored songs to ""keep up with the times"" (Shakira's ""La Tortura"" comes to mind). But who mixes two genres within a single song?!? ""Soy Differente"" flows perfectly as a salsa, until Regaetton beats come in. The style feels very out-of-place in this song, as in most other songs in this album. Maybe this kind of thing will work at a club, but not for extended listening. In my opinion, the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling India's own style. I hope she will regain contol by the next album."
1,"Es La India, tiene que ser buen material!","Desafortunadamente yo no he escuchado el nuevo de La India es por eso que no le di estrellitas.

5,More explained than the movie,"While the movie left a few aspects without explore and anothers that are imposible to show in the silverscreen, the book fills the gaps and add to the plot in the movie. Read the book is something indispensable if you want to understand better the movie. Excelent storytelling and description. An fine addition to the WC novels. I'm already waiting for the sequel, ""Pilgrim Stars""."
5,AWESOME!!,"I HATE HOLLYWOOD IDIOTS THAT MAKE CRAPPY MOVIES OF GREAT SERIES!! ESPECIALLY WING COMMANDER!! I WAS SO PISSED OFF(STILL AM!!) AIN'T NO WAY IN HELL THESE BRAIN-DEAD HOLLYWOOD IDIOTS WILL EVER GET IT RIGHT!! THE GREATEST INSULT, IS THE TMNT SEQUALS. THEY DIDN'T USE THE SAME ACTORS, & CHANGED THE APPEARANCE OF THE TURLTE'S COSTUMES!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY SEEING THE MOVIES, READ THE BOOKS INSTEAD!!!"
5,My insights,"The Wingcommander universe is a bold step away from what most of us are used to. It awakens the mind with its innovations. The fact that Christopher Blair is a minority member deeply imapacts me and puts a new human face on the normally all white Scifi universe. The courage that it took to jump a garavity well must have been a monumental leap for the farm boy of Nephele. Other than Lord of the rings, this book tells a story of more courage than any other book I've read. It is so deeply moving that I hope you'll read it too."
5,Telep should write more of these...,"Anybody else realise that Telep should just write MORE WC novels? I mean, anyone that can make the Kevin Droney movie script *readable* deserves some kinda reward...The book is fun to read, interesting and full of something the movie lacked: Character. Some come on Telep, a few more novels after Pilgrim Truth ok?"
1,SAVE your Money (Zero Stars),"Save your money. this book is not worth the price nor does it meet the standards of the books in the series. This is not the writers fault, it hard to do a novalization of a badly written and thought out screenplay. Indeed it seems that the word SF and combat are the only the backdrop for cardboard firgures to act in a manner that is a sure fire way for the hero's to get into bed , and die glorious in battlenot worth the time or moneyRead David Drake instead."
5,BUY THIS BOOK NOW! its great!,"This is a truely well written , funny , action-packed realistic book. I loved every chapter , and some things that are so great about the book haven't even been mentioned in the movie ( seeing the war from the kilrathi's eyes was a great touch) I hope that Peter Telep continues this high standard of quality into the 2 sequels , because he has built an excellent foundation to work off of."
3,History With All the Nice Boring Stuff Removed!,"This picture book has sensational pictures and fairly detailed information on the subjects it covers. Learn how kids were sold to work in coal mines, as chimney sweeps and other stuff for next to nothing as well as medieval oddities and ancient rituals. Why some world leaders were disgusting or just outright mean. History's most evil leaders are covered from Adolf Hitler to Roman leaders. This is an excellent source for historical facts so you'll stand out at the next dinner party or if you're a bit younger ace that next school assignment."
5,great book,All the books in these series are great. Even though my son is already a teenager I still see him picking up the book once in a while. A fun way to present history and spark an interest to history with kids!!!
1,Revisionist History,"This book puts Christopher Columbus, a Pope, and a few WWI soldiers on the same plane as Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Ghengis Kahn calling them all evil! This book is ABSOLUTELY WRONG for any child. It is not literature, but a poor attempt to brainwash young minds as to how horrible we Americans are!"
1,Undercuts Western Civilization,"The history of the world with no sense of proportion.Not all villains were equally villainous, but this book puts Churchill and Hitler and Truman on equal footing.Offering nothing but contempt for western civilization, and nothing but approbation for the thugs and anarchists that abound within the pages.Skip this."
1,This is not bread!,"Mom made this for us and it was awful. Nobody wanted to eat it. We threw it all out. She said it is supposed to be healthy, but it tasted like card board."
5,NY Giants Tailgating Chairs,These are amazing chairs. Strong frames. Amazingly comfortable. Exactly what I was looking for. I've seen others in the same price range that don't have the durability or quality construction that these North Pole chairs have. Accept no imitations!
4,Not bad,"Very nice looking pipe, beautiful box, but the tone just isn't the greatest. It works good, but needs to be ""tuned""."
5,love these pads!,"i work in interior design and these pads are great. perfect for making a list, drawing a room and sketching a design concept - all on the same sheet if i need to! why use this instead of a cheaper pad? better paper PLUS the top is perforated, not gummed, so i can just flip to the next page and keep going &/OR use one pad per client, keeping all notes in one place. bottom line, these pages don't leave the pad until i want them to - including the top cover page which you can leave on so that the pages underneath stay nice and tidy. the gummed versions fall right off the pad."
3,Thinner sheets than I prefer to use,"'It's OK', which is what a 3-star review is supposed to indicate. The sheets are quite thin. Why do writing pad manufacturers (unlike computer paper makers) usually not indicate the weight of the paper in their products? Buying online (or buying at a store when the sheets in a pad cannot be inspected because of packaging) becomes a hit-or-miss business because of this. I find that, like this Ampad product, most available writing pads have sheets that are thin relative to the 22lb paper I use in my computer printer."
4,Great graph paper notebooks.,"The pads came as described, and have a VERY sturdy backing to them. The only negative I have is the price. It seems that all graph paper pads are ridiculously pricey, though, so I guess it's just par for the course. All in all, these are a great size and priced well by comparison to others. The sturdy back makes it easier to use them in your lap, too. And since I use them for creating my own crochet and jewelry-making patterns, it's nice to be able to relax on the couch, in a chair, or in bed without a desk to do my designing."
4,A bit disappointed,"While the cutaway illustrations are magnificent, and the illustrator did a fantastic job, I find that only 1/2 of the 38 Lockheed aircraft indexed have cutaway illustrations. Perhaps it was too much to expect, but I anticipated similar cutaways of the seminal single-engine Lockheeds of the 1930's: Explorer, Air Express, Vega, Sirius, Altair, Orion. Only the Vega is so immortalized.Also, the index is flawed by the ""search for occurrences of"" syndrome, as the Model 9 Orion includes a listing for the P-3 Orion, and the Model 10 Electra includes the L-188 Electra.These are nits - it's a very good book - just not what I thought it was going to be. If you're looking for something specific, check out a copy in your local bookstore. If it meets your needs, *then* buy it."
3,"Good, time tested information.","I have read and re-read this book over the years. It was handed down by an older member of my family. Since it is written in an older style of prose, it is a little dense to our modern ""sound-bite"" ears. It's chock-full of esoteric information. Much of it is common to other ancient texts and teachings. The Rosicrucians have a more Western approach to this subject matter, meaning it is less frilly and is more of a how-to-do and how-it-is style of teaching. If you have read any of the more popular modern books on esoteric knowledge, you will have no problem with this book and will find it full of information. It's a sort of Heaven and Earth handbook."
5,One of the Best,"I just finished writing a review on TTF 30 and threw this thing in. Even though it's like 3 years old it's still one of the best. SEND ME AN ANGEL!!! Listening to this Volume just reinforced my comments on the fact that the latest Tunnel CDs have been a far cry from the solid sets Dean used to throw at us.But I digress, this CD is TO NOTCH. Get it (If you can find it) and you won't be disappointed. It will be in your CD player all month long..."
5,mostamazingtrancecdever!!!!,"this volume of ttf (which has best techno overall) is definitley the best of them all, and thats saying alot!! the song DJ Foxx- Goliaths Revenge, has got to be the best song ever made, and ralph fridge- angel, and balearic bill- destination sunshine, are amazing, DJ Foxx rules!!! definitley get this cd"
3,This doesn't seem to fit as well as my previous A-Force splint,"I have used an A-Force Dorsal Splint for about 4 years. Using it seems to have resolved my problem with Plantar Faciatis (sp?). I like this brand because you can walk on it--and who doesn't have to get up in the middle of the night to walk on it? But the strap going across the bottom doesn't seem to hold as well as my older one, and it slips back allowing the foot opening to expand. I still prefer this item to others I have seen, and will try to glue the strap in place."
5,wonderful,"A great product, I got immediate relief and every day is better than the prior, wear this as much as you can with as many minutes off your feet as possible...........my spur is almost gone."
4,a very good night splint,"every other night splint i was tossing and turning. this product is much better. I'm able to wake up with less pain. I recently had surgery on my foot for heel pain. I tried everything, I had foot problem for one year. cryosurgery that helped me a lot. I had the surgery on 3/12/10. about 70 percent better in one week.450 7ave 34 street room 1004 doctor nylon she is the best foot surgeon in NY words cant describe work number 212-254-0828"
2,Not working!,"At first I thought it was helping , but then it's not.. Just try to stretch the calves manually every morning instead of buying this one.Excercise!!But anyways, thanks to allegro they were able to ship it fast!"
1,I couldn't sleep with it because my foot got numb after an hour,"I bought this model because it looks so light, which made me think it will be more comfortable. It turned out to be the opposite. Because there is less material in contact with the skin, there is more pressue on those spots that are. I tried it for a couple of nights and it didn't work for me."
4,Decent,"Maybe I'm being a smidgen on the generous side with the 4 stars, but compared to other stuff written by Bunn this is gold. The characters sort of grow on you...at least they did for me. As for the writing, it's adequate but nothing stunning or wonderful. The dialogue's believable, for the most part anyways. The cover is very nice. The plot is at times a mite boring but generally the heroes end up okay so life's all good.The concept of the Night Angel is neat. Okay, that's my scattered thoughts about this book."
4,This was compact and very easy to put together,I purchased this as a birthday present for my 8 year old son and he loves it.It was so easy to put together that my 8 and 9 year old boys were able to asemble it by themselves. It is compact and easy to move around unlike most car sets.
4,THIS PRODUCT..,"This darn expensive thing broke within a week of my 4yr old getting it for Christmas. Talk about disappointed and angry. It is flimsy and cheap. While my son loved the toy it broke rather easily with light pressure. Each piece is delicately put together, definitely NOT made for a child. DO NOT BUY!!"
3,Fun but flimsy,"My son enjoys this toy, although it has lost a little bit of the initial thrill... which means that while it is shuffled around the room it breaks into several pieces at a time, and then he cannot play with it again until I reassemble it. Probably would be better if he were older (he's 4), but then I'm not sure how much interest it would hold for him. It's just too fragile and poorly built for a little kid to keep in one piece!"
4,No Complaints Here,"My 3 year old son loves this toy. When older kids come over it is the first thing they reach for. This toy has been in action for almost a year and has been used both indoors and out, and my son has not experienced problems with pieces coming apart. As a matter of fact, the only time I experienced this problem was the first time I picked it up. However, if you support it across the bottom(it is quite large)sufficiently this is not a problem. This was the first Match Box playset that I purchased, and I have purchased several smaller sets since then. This is a toy that my son will continue to enjoy for years to come."
4,BROKEN IN A WEEK!!,This toy was all my 4yr old would talk about. He wanted it for Christmas and got it. It broke within a week!! I am so very disappointed and angry that I spent the money I did on it and the pieces have broken. It no longer fits together properly. Very cheaply made!! You'd think they'd make a better product for the MONEY!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
2,A Bad Choice,"This is a horrid toy. I would have given it zero stars for durability that is not an option. The concept is cute, but this thing falls apart all the time and the parent has to keep putting it back together for the frustrated child. Cheaply made, definitely not worth the forty dollars."
3,Very Disappointed,...The foam brushes don't stay on - the ramps don't stay connected... it's very frustrating for my kids to try & play with it.It looks fun - and would be fun if it was put together better!
3,A real emergency!,"My son has been asking for this Emergency car wash for two months - daily! Santa delivered it to him this morning and he could not wait to get it working. Unfortunately, the spinner part of the car wash does not work at all and the ""washing"" portion only blows out a bubble or two at a time. I'm planning to return it, much to my son's dismay. This is the second time I've been disappointed by Matchbox...first was the awful Matchbox Mountain. No more."
3,old one was better,"Matchbox made a better car wash about 2 years ago. My son loved the old one, it was during the period that matchbox put out playsets that were 1 piece construction. Now they have followed Hot Wheels footsteps with a toy that has too many flimsy parts that easily detach and low fun value. The lack of a permanent structure makes things frustrating for the little ones. The old one let the kids shoot foam all over the car. This one just blows a few bubbles in the air. The old model had a rinse stream of water, that neatly was picked up by a grate in the roadway and recycled to use again. This new one has a bowl you can fill with water and dip your car in. The old one had a hand cranked fan that blew the car dry, the new one turns but does not do much. An utter failure in every respect. Also unneccesarily large and overpriced. This ine needs batteries, and the old one was kid powered. The elevator is kind of a neat touch, it actually does work, but overall the toy is lame."
4,The Sixties Sound Will take you back in time...,...upon listening to this album for the very first time I got the 60s pop vibe. I wish pop music was still like this. My favorite is Gotta Feelin-Michelle and Cass are so lovely on this song. I really enjoy Straight Shooter and the song by John And Paul I Call Your Name. Think of this album as the Rumors from Fleetwood Mac of its time.
5,Timeless classic,This debut lp by the mamas & papas is a timeless classic from the mid 1960s. The cover is cool as well. The mamas & papas music rocks. Only 1 surviving member is left (michelle phillips).
5,INCREDIBLE!,"I have been waiting for this album to come out on CD in Mono. I absolutely detest the Stereo version of ""California Dreamin'"". And now, this album is in my hands and I love it. Beautiful sound quality. Rich tones and Beach Boy-Like harmonies. Superb! Alert: There is some analog hiss at the beginning of most of these songs. I can hear it with headphones but not on my stereo system. The original mono master tapes were supposedly lost and I'm sure that these songs were taken from a very clean record. But the vocals are so much better in Mono that, to me, it's not a problem. That's how it sounded on the album when I bought it in 1966. And it's great!"
5,The best of the best,"I won't repeat what has been said already by so many readers, except to say that I agree with them : Lois McMaster Bujold been giving us outstanding novels one after the other, an amazing fact, considering that most writers cannot sustain intensity or readers interest for what has become a simple usual trilogy. Of these wonderful books, Mirror Dance is the best of all, well written, well paced, solid, intelligent, profound, fascinating, funny, moving, and so much more.I cannot say enough good about this one to do it justice. Lucky is the reader who will read it for the first time. What a treat!"
5,Love these glasses!,"We ordered these glasses from Amazon to replace a few that had broken in our set. We love the platinum rim that goes so well with our Wilton Armatele dinnerware. They look very impressive on the table. They arrived amazingly fast and were packed very well. I was a bit hesitant to order such delicate stemware to be shipped, but all the glasses arrived in perfect condition."
2,Not a recommendation.,"I have been searching for a perfect foot splint for a few years now. This is not a perfect solution. It is restrictive, and does not conform to the shape of the foot very well. The hard plastic form is cut from sheet plastic and has some sharp edges, and the padding does not protect the entire foot. The split nature of the toe form causes some tight fit issues, and circulation problems during extended wear. I have tried Cool Stretch boot forms, Dorsal Night Splint and Dorsal PF Night Splint by Alimed.The Dorsal PF Night Splint wins hands down for comfort, ease of use, and wearability."
1,This is NOT the Movie,BEWARE: This is misleading as it is NOT the actual movie---as it would indicate in the title. This is only an 'extra' disk that was apparently originally part of a two-dic set---obviously the movie is on the other disk.
5,The piano and bass powerhouse performances,"Some are sad there are no shots of O.P.'s hands from above, for us to see the true glory of his technique; that seems to be a legitimate claim,but since I'm not a musician (nor musicologist), as a jazz fan I'm quite happy wiht how Oscar looks...You can also hear him talk briefly, announcing the two bass players that share the stage with him and try to upstage each other in the most positive and constructive way possible.The first three solo performances by Oscar on the beginning are great...The rest of the DVD is history ...These players both know Oscar very well and, although they hardly play as a typical trio, their virtuosity shines brightly. Although flashy (as Oscar's gig sometimes are), this is a very musical and occasionally quite suble affair.Great mainstream jazz, great piano and GREAT bass playing."
2,Have to buy it the 3rd time,"This cuff works OK at first... then as the fabric wrinkles, it has a problem (because of the metal bar) of bunching up. Not only is this extremely painful, because it causes the cuff to pinch your arm and cut off circulation, but it also causes error messages on the machine, comes out with irregular heartbeat reading (because it's not monitoring the heartbeat efficiently), and it gets shoddy results. I've tried to use it correctly, had this happen, and go to the doctor shortly after and found out that the results of the machine were completely innacurate.Unfortunately, the only thing I've found to do when this starts happening is buy a new cuff, since it is slightly stiffer and resistant to wrinkling and bunching when it is fresh out of the packaging."
3,Large cuff sometimes a problem.,My pharmacist recommended the Microlife BP monitor and it seems like a great unit. The only problem was I have large arms so he recommended the large cuff. For some reason the large cuff is more difficult to use and position on my arm. The velcro seems extra sticky. I get the same reading on both cuffs.
4,It works as described.,Very good. It works as described. It can provide precise reading to MicroLift blood pressure monitor. It is with reasonable price.
4,Large,"I bought this cuff to replace an existing cuff that developed a leak. The cuff works but is definitely designed for a large person. The cuff is so wide (6.5"") that it really doesn't give me the necessary clearance between the cuff and my elbow.I like the cuff, I just wish I'd bought a smaller width cuff."
2,Good base unit,I bought the microlife maybe three or four years ago. The base unit works good and is very easy to operate. However I have blown out two arm cuffs and had to replace them. Since the base unit is so spendy i am locked into having to replace the cuffs as they blow out until the base unit goes out. I can't compare to other brands because i've never owned any other. I give the base unit 5 stars and their weak cuffs 2 stars.
2,Microlife Adult large blood pressure cuff,I wanted to purchase one extra large cuff and wound up receiving 2 for some reason. I was able to sale one of them to a friend but this one wound up being exactly the same one I already had on the machine to begin with. It was the same size so I now have to return to item for credit.
2,another one leaks,The product is okay when it the cuff not leaking. Used it for several months and the cuff start leaking again around the same spot as the original it replaced. works great when everything works properly along with software. My doctor likes the printout of my pressures which greatly helped me with controlling my high blood pressure. Would recommend this product if they would solve the leaks that develop after being used for several months. I used it 2 times a day every day.
4,My old one blew out,I ordered this one to replace my existong on that exploded. I had a small one but it did not give the correct results. This one is just like the orginal and is working so far.
2,Still too small,"For some reason the manufacturers of these cuffs fail to realize that some people have bigger arms than 17"". I am a power lifter and I absolutely cannot find a cuff that will work for me. Frustrating. I loved my Microlife unit back when I could use it."
5,Right size and Good Quality,"Having the right sized blood pressure cuff is important to get the correct reading. This cuff is identical to the one in the doctor's office. It is quality material and easy to work with. Microlife is a quality name in these types of products, and this cuff held up to the reputation."
5,A WARM SHADE OF MANCINI,"I BOUGHT MY FIRST HENRY MANCINI ALBUM IN 1969. THE NAME OF IT WAS ""A WARM SHADE OF IVORY"". NEEDLESS TO SAY I'VE BEEN WAITING SINCE 1981 FOR AT LEAST SOME OF THOSE SONGS THAT I LOVED ON THAT ALBUM TO COME OUT IN CD FORMAT. AND NOW THREE OF THOSE SONGS HAVE COME OUT IN THIS BOX SET. THE ""LOVE THEME FROM ROMEO & JULIET"", ""WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND"", AND MY FAVORITE ""BY THE TIME I GET TO PHOENIX"". NOBODY DOES THIS SONG INSTRUMENTALLY LIKE HENRY MANCINI. THIS IS THE PERFECT SONG TO LISTEN TO WHEN THE SUNSETS AND DUSK SETTLES ON THE WESTERN HORIZON. THE VERY NEXT SONG ON THE 3RD CD IS ""AIRPORT LOVE THEME"". AGAIN NO ONE DOES IT BETTER THAN MANCINI. THIS IS THE PERFECT SONG TO LISTEN TO ON A WEST BOUND NIGHT FLIGHT ACROSS COUNTRY OR EVEN IN YOUR HOME WITH THE LIGHTS TUNED DOWN LOW. HENRY MANCINI HAS A WAY WITH HIS ORCHESTRAL BLEND AND MIX OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS TO REALLY SET THE PERFECT MOOD OF A SONG."
3,Trek 570@AOL.com asks Keith for MORE!,"Honky is not a particularly strong album such as Keith's Christmas cd, but is well worth having. It would have been more than nice if new material was added for this reissue. 'Hello Sailor Intro', 'Bach Before The Mast', 'Hello Sailor Finale,' & 'Chickcharnie' are by far the best tracks. Chickcharnie will sound familiar to those who have the soundtract to 'Nighthawks'. Keith! We want more!"
3,OK effort from the King. Love Beach part 2,"OK, It's a little bit better than Love Beach, I'll give it that. The gospel according to Keith (Jesus Loves me) is very good and Salt cay.Introjuicing is priceless and very funny. Overall, it's listenable, but I don't find myself playing it very often."
1,Will I ever hear it ???,"Already charged on my credit card, but where is the CD?Is it coming or missing???"
3,A Path Filled With Uneven Patches,"By keeping in mind the type of ""biographies"" with sporting themes that Hollywood would generate in this era, the syrup that covers the real story is an enjoyable dessert.Based on the iconic natural pacer from the early years of the century, Dan Patch, the script makes sure that a good story does not get in the way of the facts. A consultant to the movie was Merton E. Harrison, who was the 1912 ""ghost writer"" of the Autobiography of Dan Patch, which was the first-person (Standardbred) recollections of the then-retired racer.But the movie is ultimately an enjoyable breeze around the oval, which will aim the curious into a trek to find the rest of the story through recent books and media accounts from newspapers when the legend was shattering records on the track and earning more than $1 million a year through a number of major endorsements."
5,a wonderful horse racing drama,"This is a fabulous film for the whole family. It tells the story of the great trotting champion, Dan Patch. But more than that is the wonderful human story and the cast of fine actors.Gail Russell and Dennis O'Keefe have seldom been better. Their love story is simple and emotionally gripping at the same time. Well directed and photographed, this 1949 film has grown in stature over the years. Not to be missed."
1,"Way Too Sweet, Not Good At All","This Biscotti is just awful, too sweet and too hard. La Tempesta is a real Biscotti."
5,Excellent,My kids have trouble with the ear buds that come with iPods and so many other music/video players now days. We saw these and thought they would solve the problem. The kids love them and the sound is terrific. They work with the iPods and the videos in the car. I would definitely buy them again.
5,A Very Extreme Metal Album!!!!!!!,"This is probably my favorite album by Megadeth, just about all the songs are fast,heavy, and killer solos. The only exception would have to be 502, which i think lyricly it could have been better but the music still rocks! In To The Lungs Of Hell is perfect for an intro to this album, Set The World Afire is my favorite really good riffs solos and lyrics of the worlds own demise, Anarchy in the UK although i'm not a punk fan i think they did a good job of adusting it to metal settings, Mary Jane my favorite next to Set the world Afire - this song is a great headbanger song, 502 once again sticks out a little but the music still rocks, Liar this song is killer with extreme solos, Hook in Mouth another favorite cuz i don't know i ran out of words, it just a great song with political lyrics that just kick [hiney], all and this ablum is one of Megadeths greats!"
4,A Great Album,"Being a huge Megadeth fan, I love Peace Sells, and Rust In Peace. They are amazing albums. However, So far , So good , So What! is a great album. It lacks stuff that RIP and PS...BWB had, but it is still a good thrash album.The opening songs Into the Lungs of Hell, and Set The World Afire are great thrash tunes. Hook In mouth, Liar,and Mary Jane also are good ones. I think 502 is the weak point, and was obviously made during Dave's addictions.In My darkest Hour is the best on here, and a classic.Anarchy In The UK is a cool track, but im not a fan of covers. overall, this cd is one of those cds where you either like to death, or hate it."
3,Of to war...,"Yes, the 88'release is not as classic as peace sells and two of the members were replaced before the record was done. This is a very Varried album with many good songs and a few not so good, ex. 502, Anarchy. Anyway In My Darkest Hour is a true classic and from this point Megadeth would evolve enourmosly. Good album."
3,Worthy of a listen.,"Until just recently, I hadn't listened to this disc in quite some time. It's very heavy and energetic. Megadeth is never disappointing when it comes to their musicianship. The guitar playing is cool as always. ""Set the World Afire"" has an interesting and funny intro to it. ""In My Darkest Hour"" is my favorite song from Megadeth. This album is far from boring. I'm not a fan of every song, but I still think that this is a pretty good disc."
4,Megadeth at their best?,"Overall, a good hard-rocking album worth buying if you're a Megadeth fan. Perhaps the weakest elements on it would be the way the drums are miked on a couple of songs and the weird intro to Mary Jane. I'd say Peace Sells... and Rust in Peace have a slightly harder edge. Otherwise So What.. is a typically satisfying piece of ear-candy from Dave Mustaine and co. still quite worthy of a place in your Megadeth album collection."
3,"It's mediocre,but at least Megadeth thrashed on this one!","It's an OK album,some songs are really good like ""Hook in Mouth"" ""502"" and ""Liar"" but the rest are kind of lackluster. Not a very good cover of ""Anarchy In The UK"" in which Mustaine replaces UK with USA which makes it even worse. Although this is old school Megadeth! Powerchords and thrash speed are included in this 1987 album,unlike what they've put out since 1992's Countdown to Extinction which is even more dismal. So Far..So Good..So What! is half good and half bad. Take your chances if you like thrash metal. You might love this,hate this or feel the same way I do ""eh,it's ok I guess""."
3,alright,"A pretty good album. Starting out with the speed metal instrumental ""lungs of hell"" a fast but very structured song, fast pace and recomended. ""Set the world on fire"" and ""hook in the mouth"" are also strong songs. The lyrics on this album are alright but it is hard to compare to the guitars and thrash style."
3,Not Bad,"Not one of my favorite albums, but this is an okay release. ""In My Darkest Hour"" is the song to buy this album for. Everything else is okay. If you like this type of music, give Celtic Frost or Coroner a listen; both of them are great."
3,"Inconsistent, though okay","Megadeth's third album is a little disappointing after the great Peace Sells. It's true that half the lineup had been replaced, and they still played well and, at times, with a furious metal intensity. However, one could wish for better songwriting from the pen of Dave Mustaine. Of the eight cuts on here, only three made me want to jump out of my seat and destroy things, which is not good. Those three are 'Into the Lungs of Hell' (a wicked instrumental), 'Set the World Afire' (one of their best heavy thrashers) and the epic 'In My Darkest Hour'. The cover of 'Anarchy in the U.K.' is stiff and almost laughable, while the rest of the tracks are mediocre. The result is a record that will be worth it for dedicated 'Deth fans, but is inessential for most listeners."
1,terrible,"this cd is extremely boring and uninteresting. the only memorable song is the instrumental into the lungs of hell. other than that, the efforts here are poorly produced, written, and played. this is the worst megadeth album, besides killing is my business. i sugguest either ""rust in peace"" or ""youthanasia"", these two albums capture the elements of megadeth, and albeit people consider youthanasia to be weak, the bridge in reckoning day says it all my friends."
1,This album is a turkey,Only two good songs: Hook in Mouth & In My Darkest Hour. '...And Justice for All' and 'South of Heaven' crap all over this.
5,Thrash at its best,"This cd displays the awesome ability of Megadeth, Jeff Young does an awesome job of filling in for Chris Poland I really believe Young Was better than Poland and very well may be better than Marty Friedman just amazing dual shred solos from Dave and Jeff all around includes Ellefson's great thundering bass lines with very memorable drumming from Chuck Behler the most underrated Megadeth cd EVER, listening to this cd makes me feel that its an atrocity that this lineup didn't create anymore studio albums."
3,"Mean,Fast,and Aggressive! WOW!","This is a solid thrash album that is a little bit overlooked.But why?It is really good,not great but fun to listen to.Megadeths meanest release to date and if you like mean youll love this!The only average songs are liar,set the world afire,and anarchy the rest are excellent especially In my darkest hour and hook in mouth.They made me want to break something,thats always a good sign!"
5,Damn Dave is pissed!,"Flawed album to be sure, but probably my favorite-what is good is Megadeth at it's angriest best.what is bad is...so what?"
3,Megadeth's Flop,"After Peace Sells the music scene expected more from the band but they lost focus, the production went really bad, the band went to dope land and the band was striped to half in the beggining of the recordings all of this are reasons why Megadeth's third album is not a development of their music but a small setback.Aside from that this album has great songs such Hook in Mouth and In My Darkest Hour and my personal fav Into The Lungs of Hell"
1,Tell me it isn't so!,This guy is actually planning to release an album? What is the world coming to? He is probably one of the most boring and out- of class singers of all time. What kind of 17-year old would make a jazz album? TALK ABOUT LAME!!
5,This kid is good!,"I watched John Stevens get a lot of flack on American Idol, and he took it like a man. Made me like him even more. True, he may not be American Idol material, but so what? He is great in his own style, and this single proves it. Someone has been working with him, he sounds like he has improved considerably since his days on AI, and he was already great then!He has a bit of a Sinatra sound to him, but I like John better, as I have never liked Sinatra.I like this CD, and I will be sure to buy ""Red"" when it comes out."
2,Nothing special...,"I wasn't at all moved by this version of the song. I LOVE this song, and Frankie has made it what it is. This comes nothing close. Michael Bublee' does a much better version, very powerful and beautiful tone. I would love to see John Stevens succeed because I love this music genre and I think he has some real talent...but his first cut at it wasn't anything special."
1,Like Michael Buble minus the talent,"This single offers nothing new whatsoever. Potential buyers and/or listeners will do well to spend their time and money on Sinatra. If you must listen to a young revivalist attempting to prop up the genre (because that digital CD is so much cleaner than those nasty 50 year old recordings), at least listen to Michael Buble for his stong voice and interesting phrasings. But not John Stevens.On this track, his timing is terrible, his vibrato is reminiscent of Alvin Chipmunk, he fails to excite when the music builds (1:49), and he doesn't have the vocal power to get through the last big note of the song (3:09). The arrangement is boring as well, with an intro that sounds like it came straight off of a karaoke track."
1,poor quality battery FOR HIGH COST,THE BATTERY COSTS SELLERs 5 CENTS EACH.tHE BATTERY is as cheap quality as you can getExpect to only last few months on light load
3,Watch Battery,"While the battery works perfectly well, I can't get overly enthusiastic over a battery. Sorry."
1,Amazon Sold Me the Wrong Battery,"It is very annoying when a person types the name of a product in and gets multiple hits back from Amazon. In this case, I typed in the name of a battery I needed, the Sony SR920W and got two hits from Amazon. I gravitated toward the cheaper of the two items I found from the search and ordered it. It turned out to be Sony 626SW. I did not realize until I got the battery that it was wrong. So I ended up wasting $6.75 and two weeks. I threw them out and ordered the correct ones from Battery Bob, who sent me the wrong ones. It was Amazon's fault, not Battery Bobs, for giving two selections for one search. Amazon is so bent on selling stuff that it gives multiple hits even to specific search terms. It is annoying."
2,short lived experience,"Worked fine for a few days. Then my watch started running a little slow with this battery. Within a week it was losing 5 minutes a day. I stopped wearing the watch last week because it's so far off I can't count on it. I e-mailed the seller with my complaint, they sent a replacement battery at no charge. The new battery is working fine."
5,It's a battery.,"It powers my watch. It wasn't ticking, and now it is. Yup.Eight more words required? It's just a battery."
2,Worked for a little while,"i was very pleased with he price, but i guess it was too good to be true. battery lasted about 1 month in my watch. i ended up having to go to the store and buy one that cost more..."
2,LONG TIME COMING,"Sealed card-pack battery, received in regular envelope (Almost shredded as ""junk mail"" - but noticed a small bump in corner); took over a week to get here. If you'd need to get your watch running ASAP go somewhere else. If ordering a spare OK."
4,AEC review,"Battery works great. The battery should last a couple of years. This was a original manufacture replacement battery.I wlill advise, if the battery lastl less than a year."
5,Just what I was looking for,"Perfect watch battery replacement. I tried buying a similar SR battery from Walgreens and it didn't work in the watch even though it was the same model number. This worked perfectly, arrived quickly and was a great price."
2,I really wanted to love this...,"and perhaps I am not as qualified as others to make a review of this nature. I love poetry and literature from a layman's perspective. As such, I came into this purchase with certain expectations. Primary among them was that this would be organized like a dictionary with relevant poetry under each heading. That is not at all what this is, and as such it was useless for someone like me with limited time. This may be great for the person that has the time to meander through its pages, but for a person looking for a ready reference work there may be better choices."
1,worst product ever,I can not believe it had so many good reviews. This product can not remove stains at all. :(
1,Don't bother,"A word of warning to anyone considering purchasing this CD -- I bought it primarily for Dennis Coffey's ""Scorpio,"" hoping to find some other funky 70s-80s instrumentals, of which there are many. Instead, this is a strange hodge-podge of tunes that don't really belong together -- and who needs to hear the song ""Tequila"" again?"
1,TERRIBLE Edition,"While the translation is readable, this book is missing sizable chunks of the original text, which is entirely unforgivable. The entire discourse on private property through beans is missing, as well as a discussion on the Savoyard Vicar. This is hardly suitable for either a general reading or deep study, I suggest the Bloom translation instead."
2,Cute but overpriced,"I bought this for my granddaughter who is crazy about cats but isn't permitted to have a live one. I was looking for a toy that would be as close as possible to the ""real thing."" In some ways, this product measured up. Our little one carried her cat with her for hours and loved the life-like breathing feature. However, like others, I was disappointed that there is no movement other than the breathing. I was surprised and disappointed that the cat is so hard ... no kitten softness. Biggest disappointment for me, however, was the carrying case. The zipper broke with the first zip before our granddaughter got to touch it."
2,Cat-astrophe,"The cat was realistic and very cute. It does nothing but gently breathe as it lies curled up. There is a brush and adoption certificate. Unfortunately the package was not properly secured before shipment and the cat carrier was pretty crunched up. It appeared to 'breathe' okay. Unfortunately the cat wasn't breathing when opened on Christmas Day. My daughter refused for it to be returned, as this was a gift from Santa. I could have spent less money on a beautiful plush that she could sleep with. Hopefully this was just a fluke as it is a really good idea for the unfortunate who aren't allowed pets."
3,Decent early Nigtwing adventure!,In this collection of some early adventures of Nightwing we get to see him deal with things on his own without Batman's guidance. The plotline is decent if not a little hokey. While I have always disliked most of Nightwing's early looks the art here is pretty good considering the time period. Overall a decent Dick Grayson story.
1,I wish I could give it NO stars,Bought this for the deign and color and we used it for maybe 3 weeks. Callers cannot hear you speaking and most of the features didn't work right or work at all!
1,Memorex disappoints.,"I bought this phone based on looks and was quite disappointed. The display doesn't work correctly and you can't hear anything on the other line. The volume won't adjust loud enough. The flip piece is rather flimsy, as is the belt clip that I've already snapped in two. The belt clip also helps the phone rest in it's cradle correctly, so without it I have to be sure it's charging properly. If you want someone in your house spending less time on the phone you might try giving this one to them. They'll avoid it soon enough..."
3,Not So Great,"I gave this product an extra star for the occasional interview segments involving Capone historians Dennis Hoffman, John Binder, and William Balsamo, and for the especially interesting segments with Harry Hart, Al Capone's nephew and son of Al's lawman brother Vincenzo, a.k.a. James ""Two-Gun"" Hart, and with George E.Q. Johnson's son. For the most part, however, the show is boring and silly, consisting largely of dull re-enactments, almost-as-dull crowd scenes on the Untouchables Tours bus, repetitive clips from a couple of Capone movies, plus occasional plugs for the now long-defunct Merry Gangsters Literary Society (headed by Mr. Binder when this program was filmed back in the late 1990s). The history is shallow and the narrator's errors include having Johnny Torrio shot after the Hawthorne Hotel attack. Better research, more historical photos and films, and trimming some of the excess nonsense might have produced a real Capone documentary."
3,A good introduction to the life of Capone,"This documentary was informative to me, I had been paying more attention to Dillinger and now I want to learn a little more about Capone. The film on this DVD was produced in 1998, I don't know if the bus tours are still operating but I will look for them next time I visit Chicago. The film shows some of the actual places, back at the time and as they are nowadays; to me that makes this and any other biography more interesting. I don't know if my DVD is a bootleg, since I only payed $1.00 at a Wally World store, they have not restocked more. You can see a lot of $1.00 DVDs around at many places, pharmacies and dollar stores, this one was a pretty good find. Maybe it is a bootleg, since it was about Capone, hehe that was not funny..."
2,Al Capone DVD,"I expected more from the DVD. It was ok, just not cinematic quality. I think the price was more that it should have been."
1,Two Months Later...,"I was thrilled to be able to find these little decorations for my bettas... now I can see why they were on sale.As I clean the tank weekly, more and more of the paint has come off. At first the spots of missing paint were so small I didn't notice, but now if you just run water over them, large flakes peel off.Obviously, these are marked for quick sale, but buyer beware.. they won't last. Even at .99 they aren't worth the price."
4,Dinosaurs and Dead professors,"Mr. and Mrs. North solve murders. 'Dead as a Dinosaur' is the first I've read, and I enjoyed what the Lockridges, the husband and wife writing team, have created. We have a dinosaur museum, cave men and a dead scientist or two, which make for an unusual collection stuff, and the mystery gives the Norths much to puzzle over. The dialogue is witty. The suspects are interesting, and the first murder is insidious in its own special way.This particular book comes well after the mystery series has begun and the main characters and their associations with the police are well established, but that doesn't hurt at all. The only drawback is the ending, where the crime-solvers and the suspects spend too much time moving from room to room during those final chapters, which turned out not to be as climatic as they should've been. But for an early 50's mystery it is worth the read and it's more engaging then some current mystery fiction."
2,Author is stretching it.,"With friends in high places (such as Chopra, Williamson and Neale Donald Walsch), I have a feeling the author decided she wanted her own new age book and came up with this very stretched idea.Everday words which lack spiritual meanings on their own are grouped into chapters such as COMMUNICATION (with words like Television, Friend and Joy), ENLIGHTENMENT (Competition, Priest, Education), HEALING, TRANSFORMATION...you get the point.If you're going to use the word ""transformation"" in the title of a book, then the words themselves should be transformative. There are plenty of other words we MIS-use everyday which could have made for an actually satisfying, life-altering book. I personally will not think twice when I use the word ""television."" Will you??? Just because it is wrapped in a chapter titled COMMUNICATION does not make its etymology, or how we use the word, spiritual in nature."
5,There all here!,One of the Best Supremes CD I've ever owned.I believe the format is MPEG which might be a problem forolder car players. First class for the Supremes.
5,A pleasure to deal with,"This individual was a pleasure to deal with, and the product was in excellent condition at a competitive price."
3,It's Better Then Most BUT...,"All of the Supremes hits are here, but this is a sloppy re-master. In the first track, ""Ross"" gets a little lost in the background. Actually, I think this song has always been that way. But that would mean that Motown recorded her voice on the same track as the horns, and can't pull her up now. I doubt it. Some day, the lable will release a REAL remastered recording of the Supremes, maybe one as good as ""Apple & EMI"" did with the Beatles."
4,Gift Appreciated,"At the comment of a friend that her favorite song by the artist is ""Ribbon in the Sky"", I purchased it for her. Unfortunately she insisted on paying me but she is delighted with the CD. Ipersonally would have made a few changes in a few of the other ballad selections."
5,great book,"Let me start by stating that I am fairly new to big game hunting (deer etc.). I've tried scouting without much succes--until reading this book. THe best part of the book (the main focus) is in helping hunters practice to know how to locate game in the field before spooking them. I've looked at a good amount of books on hunting deer and I this is the best I have seen, hands down. Get it and you won't regret it. P.S. I don't see why this book wouldn't help you in locating other game using similar techniques."
4,A great film about a great part of the world,"I rode this route in reverse in the winter of 2012.I went before I saw this film. I went to almost all of the same places and found the information factual and the film work excellent for the genre. For anyone thinking of doing this ride, you wont find a more accurate portrayal of the place. Having ridden these roads I'd like to compliment the guys bike handling abilities. I like the plain spoken style of the narration. Bien hecho!"
1,skinny rules,"the book is not worth [the money]. I expected recipes, more meal plans than were included, and more detail about the way food burns fat. There are only 3 pages worth of information and I acquired that much from the magazine article in First for Woman."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I read this VERY little book and was sorely disappointed. I was expecting specifics about the plan and other guidelines. I believe this book was published, more to promote the ""Skinny"" supplements, than to be a source for information about losing weight.From the items listed in this book, I can't possibly believe you can lose weight. Maybe with the additional pills you can buy through the company, but definitely not from the book. It's like a previous reviewer said, there are no quantities of any food items in this book and all the information could be put on a one-page flyer.Don't waste your money!"
1,Not worth the money,"If I could have browesed through this book at a book store I would have never bought it. I found more information from the magazine article, Women First, then in this book. What a dissapointment this was. I would return this book if I could."
1,Skip this one...,"This is an ""itty bitty"" book with a hefty price and very little worthwhile content.....just alot of warm fuzzy stuff. I am very disappointed in Edita Kaye, having enjoyed her ""Fountain of Youth"" and been successful with it, I had hoped this would provide some new angles and/or menus. Instead, it appears thatEdita stuck her hand into my pocketbook and I was left holding the bag. As my 5th grade teacher used to say, ""A word to the wise should be sufficient."""
5,Reading This Book I Found A Frien,"I read this little book and felt that Edita was speaking to me personally. She really knows how it feels to be fat, unloved, scared and confused by all the diets out there. I loved her true stories about having dinner with her angel and her inspiring message. But I mostly love the fact that for the first time in over 25 years of dieting I actually understand how to lose and that it doesn't take a lot. I have already lost 12 pounds in just 12 days with this little book and have given it as a gift to my family and friends. Thank you Edita for sharing and giving to all of us."
2,Over promise. Under deliver. Far from a compleat trading book,"This is the second book I read of the author. I have a very high opinion on his ""Rules of the trade"". The headline under the book title, ""How to make a living as an indpendent, stock, options or futures trader"", did lead me to expect something of the quality of ""Trading for a living by Alexander Elder"". I had been very disappointed. Apparently the author's strength is on trading psychology, not technical/fundamental analysis. His so called foundational analysis is nothing more than a marketing name with weak TA and FA substance. All the worse, the chapters seem quite disorganised and badly written. Somehow I wonder whether this book was simply published to promote his website. Considering the ocean of better alternatives in the market including the author's previous book I mentioned above, I strongly suggest you to give this a pass."
5,Hot Wheels Every Christmas,"Every year we end up with one of these Hot Wheels sets under the Christmas tree. Each set looks more ridiculous than the last (""volcano blaster"" was our first). This toy has hardly anything I look for; there is zero educational value and the set rarely lasts past Valentine's Day (parts go missing or get stepped on, batteries die, cars can't be found)and it's just darn impossible to get it back in the box to store it neatly anywhere. But while these Hot Wheels sets are around they are just pure, pure wonderful fun and worth every penny we spend on them. The best part (for me) is my sons, their uncle and their father spend a lot of time putting the set together and then hours playing with it together. They laugh themselves sick and I never regret buying one of these toys. Also, if you are thinking about this set for Christmas don't delay too long. Some years I've waited and they have become hard, or impossible, to find closer to Christmas."
3,The usual defects,"As with all Hot Wheels sets, this toy looks much more fun on the picture than it really is. Impressive loops and slides do not really work and after spending half an hour trying to put it together, the set was a disappointment. Beware that this toy is huge when put together--it can take a good part of your living room--and you can't really dismantle it (at least we can'ty as we inveitably loose pieces)."
1,BORING,"My seven year old son got this for Christma, and hes already bord with it. It loses its fun fter about 20 minuttte- all you can do is set it up and watch cars go around in a circle. This is true with mosttoys like this. Get your kid something he or she can use again and again, like LEGOs ormatchbox cars.Often it's cheaper to get something like that than a huge, expensive thing like the octoblast."
3,Ten Minutes of Fun,"First I will conceed that my six year old was very excited to unwrap this toy and even more excited as I was putting it together (took about 20 minutes).However, he's played with it for about ten minutes and now it sits ready to collect dust."
4,Fun to start with but children lose intrest easily,I think the Octoblast is an okay toy. I do think it could have been made a little more durable for kids. I think it a little over priced for what you are actually getting. Pretty okay toy though.
3,A little pain with this game....,"My son LOVED the Octoblast...had a blast with it....until...he put a car in while it was running and pinched his finger. It bled, he screamed, and down came the Octoblast. He's been asking for another since he is a year older and when the price comes down, we'll probably get him another one. They are big and take up a lot of room and not good if you have other little ones in the house. It can be a little dangerous too since the spinning blocks that propel the cars skin your fingers if you accidently touched them. You can't move it easily once it's put together because it falls apart."
1,A total disaster,"This film contained too many historical inaccuracies to count. It is irritating, disconnected, and promotes ridiculous racial stereotypes. Thank God this was not Spike Lee's first film. It would have been his last.Do not waste your time."
1,"this movie is not good , really not good ...","call it a disaster , rubbish , poor , bad , its simply not good..."
5,Great Movie,"One of Spikes best films. Great cast and performances. Sad reviews from people who don't understand what it was like in the 1940's. Go read a little history people, but look at other sources and just not the mainstream."
4,An amazing journey of four men!,"I or you may not be much familiar with the historical facts that had actually occured at Tuscany, during the World War II, but here, we still get to see a film full of live charecters with energetic and flamboyant performences. We witness charecters that are genuine, having great chemistry between themselves and to be honest, the way they engage your mind totally, you almost forget to realize how time have passed. 'Miracle at St Anna' is one of those films that will glue your eyes to the screen. There is violence, there is tension, there are moments of alomst every single human emotion. The film is not just a typical world war depiction containing the words 'Brutal' and 'Violence', its much more than that. Its warmhearted, its shocking, its overwhelming and its a journey to remember. A very rare film, worth watching."
2,Well intended tripe,"One of Spike's worst, I'm sorry to say. I was looking forward to seeing it, especially after the dust up when Spike decided to take Clint Eastwood to task over not showing any Black marines on Iwo. Now it seems Spike was just selling wolf tickets to promote his film. This effort barely holds together. And the little fairy tale ending doesn't help at all. Neither do all the cliched close up shots of Nazi insignia and uniforms with heavy music playing in the background. What a mess. Too bad."
2,Forced viewing,"I wanted to fast-forward through the unnecessary scenes, but my friend forced me to watch it. I want about 30-45 minutes of my life back!I really wanted to like this movie. I'm very interested in movies depicting World War II especially in the European theater. This was in Italy, so I took a gamble on it. About halfway into the movie, I figured the Italian boy was the man who dropped his espresso earlier in the movie. I even predicted the ending correctly. I honestly felt the movie could have cut out maybe 30-45 minutes (mostly the bigoted back stories). I felt most of it wasn't needed. I also felt that the nudity scenes had no place in this movie. Now this is far-fetched, but seriously folks, the language spoken by the black officers sounded like present day speak. This was just another typical movie by Spike Lee. So much promise in the beginning, but it was all downhill from there."
1,tongue in cheek comedy,"this movie was so bad that it rate up there with my ten worse films. I thought it might well be tongue in cheek humor poking fun at predictable sterotype script writing but then realized as it went on and on that spike lee was trying to be seriou.s Just all around bad screen writing, bad directing, and bad editing. The fact that it was even nominated for anything but a razzi award reflects on ""its who you know"""
3,good war movie with questions...,"From all the reviews for this movie...there's lots of love and lots of hate for it.Im sure there was a lot of injustice for the 92nd Buffalo soldiers, there was stilllots of hate of the black man.Ill have to look more at the History to really judge this movie from Spike.I would love to see a White man's version and then compare both of them. Were mostwhite commander that racist...was there continous hate for the colored...im surethere was...but im sure also there are lots of related stories that were never told.But for sure...lots of soldiers and civilians died because of the WAR, and it justmakes movies like this more interesting.Great for a view."
1,"Not impressive, not good...just bad","I was excited about this movie as I enjoy war movies..Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, etc. The story line had real potential, but failed to deliver. This movie was so poorly done I feel bad for the actors that were in it. Bad camera angles, bad acting, bad editing....just bad. The other negative review unfortunately are all accurate so i will save your time in saying the same things. Thanks Spike for wasting more than 1.5hr's of my life."
1,Miracle that it was ever released to the public,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I fell asleep about 30 minutes into it the first time, and then the 2nd time I had to keep myself awake. This movie could have been interesting, but Spike Lee did his usual ""political"" offering which was tiresome at best. This movie is not the best since ""Saving Private Ryan""....if SPR is considered a ""10"" in terms of great movies, then Miracle comes in at less than ""1"". This movie is literally hard to watch and the characters are about as exciting as a root canal. If the Germans wanted to use torture on the Jews, POW's, Gypsies, etc. during WWII, this movie would have done the trick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Trash and rubbish,"This movie/story had so much potential. I am shocked how poor this film is. It is a just a insult to the viewer's sensiblilties and even more of an insult to black soldiers of WWII. The opening of the made little sense nor had any reality as to detective work, or hard work of the supposed reporter. Just boring fodder for some reason. As the story progresses it continues to make little sense, is disjointed, stumbles around with incredibly poor dialog to the point I wanted to scream outloud how bad the film was! The movie is ridiculous at best. I watched about half,decided to read reviews which are equally disappointed. I decided to throw the DVD in the trash where it belongs. This movie is rubbish."
1,Historically Incorrect,"Historically incorrect. As ANY military member both active duty, retired or former knows, NO troops would hold the weapons as they do currently. The butt of the rifle was towards the deck, not on the shoulder duringthat time. I guess Spike Lee failed to hire someone who knew aboutthe military. The way that currently members hold the weapons was notactive until the first Gulf War (butt of weapon on shoulder, muzzle tothe deck). I noticed this on the preview and knew the movie was justsome clowns PR stunt.To Spike Lee, hire actual former military advisers to instruct you. Not, ""yes Men"" who won't say counter your word."
2,Spike's Greatest Miss,"I waited a long time to purchase this movie because I believed the original asking price was too high. Although I finally got a price I would except, I now feel any price is too high to pay for this movie in any format. Every aspect of this film from script to direction was lacking in so many ways you would believe it to be a television production from the 80's. I would have thought that a story of such historical importance would have been told with more passionate depth in order to rekindle some form of interest in the positive contribrutions of Black Men in America. Instead the amatureish acting coupled with the lack of drama failed to spark any interest in the events depicted int this film at all. Spike and all involved with this movie should have given more thought and heart to these men who sarificed thier lives so honorably in a war where our contribrution is but a whisper in the minds of those who were involved."
5,What is Wrong With the Reviewers???,"I have no idea why this movie got so many bad reviews!! This is one of those movies that after you watch it, it leaves you with a lingering feeling of happiness and the idea that this miracle at St. Anna did occur!! This movie was so well acted, I loved how they mixed in all the sides including the Italians and Germans!! It's a well-rounded movie and you're glued to the screen waiting to see what will happen next!! Also Spike Lee did an amazing job with his subtle and ""in your face"" messages of racism and also messages of how no matter what race you are, war affects everyone. I also love how Spike shows that human emotion and connection is more important than where you're from! I loved this movie so much that after I rented it, I bought it right away! Enjoy this one! You won't regret it!"
1,MIRACLE at MY.HOUSE,I know what the miracle is!!!!Its the fact that I got half way through before returning this masterpiece of garbage back to Blockbuster. There isnt anything I can say different that all the other reviewers who were forced to give this 1 star because we couldnt go any lower.Terrible. Me and me give this pile of poop 2 thumbs way down.
4,"I thought it was good, I don't know what ya'll talkin' about...",I thought the movie was a very good movie. I definitely saw Spike Lee's style in the movie. The movie can be confusing but you just need to stop asking questions and have patience and rushing it along. Everything comes together in the end. Give a try before ya buy the movie though.
5,Loved This Movie,"Amazon sells great products! The movie was in superb condition and at very little cost. Now the story line of this movie was incredible and one of the best movies I have seen in my life! No spoilers, but I would recommend this movie to anyone! :)"
1,Spike Lee's Lost Cause,"I am 1 hr 44 mins into this film and had been continuously bored by this complete mess of a big budgeted war film.Spike Lee should have done better homework before he launched his attempt to recount black soldiers heroicsduring WWII. At lease he could have cut 40 mins out of this 160 mins film. For more details, refer to the othernegative reviews."
5,Miracle at St Anna,"This movie was taken out of the theaters almost as soon as it began showing. I kept intending toget a copy for review, but it slipped my mind for a while. I'm so grateful that I kept it in theback of my mind and purchased it when I remembered recently. This movie was fabulous! It containsjust right dosage of Spike Lee's signature messages of enlightenment, and is just a well thought out, well made film.I love the scenery, the diversity, the acting was dynamic, and the plot was captivating. So glad, I finally gotto view it!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Pitiful attempt at making a war movie. Spike Lee should just stop making movies altogether, and has NO business criticizing anyone else's movies. The dialogue was miserably bad, so much so that it was hard to look past it for anything likable in this waste of film. Mr. Lee, keep the money but I want the 2 hours of my life back."
3,Could have been better,"Miracle at St. Anna is a story about 4 men in the 92nd Buffalo division of the United States Army. To be blunt and straight to the point, Spike Lee could have made a better attempt at staying true to the book. In many cases, there are major discrepancies between the book and the movie (both as the characters are concerned and with certain events). In my opinion, this is an average WWII flick (although it was a nice change of pace to see authentic languages being spoken instead of English merged with bad accents). It would have been nice to see more detail and background information in the interest of character development; although I do understand that there are time constraints and budget issues with movies. I was not able to connect with the characters as well as I did while reading the book. Overall, the movie is worth watching; however, if you read the book first, like me, you may be disappointed with the overall feel of the movie."
3,they work,they work but I have read that bosch products dont work well in jeeps which I have. I dont know if its the headers I put in around the same time or these but I lost alot of MPG. if you have a jeep I would recommend the ntk brand
2,Editor please,"These reviewers are not exaggerating; there are multiple typos on nearly every page. The poor editing broke the flow of the book and I found myself frustrated during the read (perhaps this isn't very ACT minded of me). While reading, I thought we would never accept this of a graduate psychology student's academic or professional writing, yet they can sell it to me for $20. The ACT principles are communicated intelligently and clearly in this book."
2,Either poor quality or poor storage conditions,"Bone by Bone appeared to be in good condition. However, when my husband started reading it (he was the first reader of a ""new"" book), the first 40% of the pages just fell out of the binding, some individually and some in chunks of pages. The book just came apart! Was it cheaply made? Being a Peter Matthiessen book, that's hard to believe. More likely, it had been stored somewhere exposed to fluctuations in heat/cold and humidity."
5,Just what I was looking for,"My son has a lot of knowledge in his little brain but needs work on the skills required to put that knowledge together & to use. These activities are exactly what I was looking for, for him. For such a low price, there are a LOT of activities here: 327 pages worth, ranging from patterns to sorting to deductive reasoning to analogies. Gem of a find."
3,Professional Development,"Good stuff, thought it was a little more applicable to my situation with professional development at my school."
5,Wonderful masterpiece!,I've been listening to Jose Feliciano for many many years and never tire of his music. I had this album on vinyl and fell in love with its romantic feel. Very soothing Spanish guitar accompied by other instruments. Jose never gives a poor performance.
5,JOSE IS OKAY!!!,"his cut of ""light my fire"", by itself, is worth five stars...like some others, i was quite pleased by other recordings on this CD...Thank You!!"
5,Outstanding original!,This was first produced on vinyl in 1968. It was outstanding then and still is today. The hits of the '60's put to Feliciano's special beat. Last Thing On My Mind is so haunting. This is quite an eclectic collection of songs that demonstrates Feliciano's wide-ranging style!
4,Great music from a premiere guitar player.,"One of the best Feliciano discs issued. The sound is clear and clean. The selection of material, especially his renditions of ""California Dreamin"" and ""Light my Fire"", are superb."
5,At Last I Found You,"I owned this album many years ago that someone destroyed. It had been so many years and I looked in a music store and they said it was no longer available. My heart broke. How could this be with such a wonderful artist and collection of songs, never to be able to get again? Well I had a hunch that Amazon would have it if nobody did and I was right. You have no idea how thrilled that I am that I will once again have this collection of songs that only Feliciano could have done the most perfect way with his heart,mind and soul with such a given talent that always brought me such listening joy to hear. Nobody could duplicate this album's songs as this wonderful artist did. Thank you Feliciano and Amazon. mrssymmington"
2,Disappointing,"The quality of the sound and the song arrangements sound dated to me, I'm afraid. I was looking forward to hearing them again after many years but was disappointed."
3,Over-marketed sounding,"The masterful guitarist first gained popularity in the late 60's with this smart compilation of songs which does unfortunately peak absolutely early and never really recovers. Feliciano's Spanish-stringed attacks remain vibrant, but the eventual ploy behind this album's intent makes itself known, as saturated and dated AM-string styled arrangements hamper urgency afforded to renditions presented at their starkest."
1,What games??????,"Didnt buy it, no list of games included!I want to see a detailed list of the games offered before i buy, not just pay cash blindly."
1,piece of junk,"waste of money graphic are crapy, virtue fighter2 is way diffrent with the arcades bottom line don,t waste your time and money"
4,It's worthy,So many oldie but goodies. I feel like playing something else it's the best lazy ever - no changing discs :] Even though there is one or two I might not care for the majority are great and you can't beat how many for the how much. And some are with sequels!
4,Nice,"Would have gotten five stars if it had Shining Force 1 & 2 instead of 3 Eco the dolphin games, and who wants to play sword of vermilion nobody I know."
5,Relive your childhood,"If you ever played a Sega Genesis and enjoyed it, then I would recommend this game. All the Sonic's, Shinobi's, and many others. Probably the best part is, unlike the Genesis versions, you can save your game at any time. Getting ready for the bonus round for chaos emeralds in Sonic? Big boss stage in Shinobi? Save it before you go in and if you are unsuccessful, just pick up right before you failed. Is that cheating? Probably. . . . but fun."
4,BLAST FROM PAST,"I grew up playing these ames on my genesis. Not all of these games are real must plays but for the most part most the games are all classic sega. This collection is much better if you grew up on these games. New players to these games might be turned off by the difficulty of almost every game. I had forgot how hard these games can be!This collection is highly recommended. It almost never gets old because you have thirty other games to choose from. This collection would be perfect if it included Streets of Rage. But oh well, I still have a total blast playing Sonic and Vectorman again."
4,Flashback from childhood,Well I have to say I am pleased with all the cool games that are on here. It was a flashback of all the games I once played on my old genesis. I really enjoyed playing most of the games (Especially Sonic the Hedgehog)I would recommend to anyone looking for easy game play with little thinking required.
5,Excellent and unique,"We have bought several of these and they are great, long lasting and refreshing."
1,"Interesting locale, not so interesting book","I purchased this book because I live close to Old Salem (where the book takes place). I read lots of books, but not usually romance novels - thought I'd give this a try, due to the location and since I had met the author, yadda, yadda, yadda.Although the locale and time period were very much of interest to me, the rest of the book was pretty much horrible. I was quite surprised to hear everyone else rave about it. The book is choppy, at best and makes for a very long read.I have read other romance novels since, so I can conclude that it is not the entire genre of romance novels that turns me off, simply this particular book."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"While engagingly written, this book doesn't quite know what it wants to be. If a historical analysis of the hippie generation, it is lacking, with only a few rehashes of well-trod territory: the Summer of Love, Altamont, the 1968 Democratic Convention. If a resource book for present day hippies, it doesn't give enough information: publishers of books and songs, birth and death dates in the biographies, etc. I suppose that spontaneity and informality are the trademark of the hippie lifestyle, but they are sometimes a drawback for people looking for information."
1,"Diabetic, maybe - NOT LOW CARB","This would be a good cookbook for diabetics who still eat flour, potatoes and sugar, BUT for those of us following a diet such as Atkins these recipes are useless! One recipe called for 1 1/2 CUPS of flour!!! I about fell on the floor. And a word to those people that think diets such as Atkins are all fat all the time: 1. You need to eat higher levels of fat since that is your energy source on this diet. Low-carb AND low-fat is a DANGEROUS combination. 2. Having said that, you do not eat bacon at every meal. I eat chicken, fish and veggies, too - I just don't freak out if the restaurant puts butter sauce on my veggies."
4,This is SENSIBLE,"Jeez, the recipes might have a smidgen of flour or cornmeal BUT they are not laden with mayo, high fat meats, and tons of cheese like the other low carb cookbooks I have seen. If you are interested in cutting back on carbs without clogging your arteries, this cookbook is AWESOME!!!!!!!"
2,Poor quality,I didn't like this item too much due to the material of the paper. It seemed much more a normal paper than the ones to the origami craft.
2,Eh it is OK,"It is fine - the sheets are tiny, but the description says that. I was expecting more from it, but it will work for my purposes."
3,Expensive for what this is,"For one thing, don't be fooled: this is a package of 18 sheets of 5 7/8 x 5 7/8 in. paper. It comes in 9 colors, which is nice, but this can be found in any large craft store, in more colors, larger sizes, for less money. For example, at Pearl, you can find 24 pieces of this same metallic paper, with more colors for about $1.95, and you don't have to pay for shipping, like if you order them offline."
4,Probably not the best Ella DVD you can buy,"I love Ella with all my heart; I just don't think this is the best Ella DVD you can buy. It's still very nice though, with some hot swinging, few fine and dandy moments for Tommy Flanagan, a true jazz poet on piano, a nice bossa nova...But, the choice of songs is somewhat questionable (too much transient contemporary fodder) and Ella's voice actually sounded better even on some slightly later recordings and her spirit and power was higher even at some quite significantly later recordings (see Ella's Montreux DVD from 1977, also with Flanagan)... So, if you like Ella, as I do, you're sure to like this DVD, although I prefer these two DVDs:Jazz Icons: Ella Fitzgerald Live in '57 and '63,Norman Granz Jazz in Montreux Presents Ella Fitzgerald and Tommy Flanagan Trio '77"
3,Reads a bit too high,"There are many features of this monitor that I love. It keeps track of 30 blood pressure readings for two users which can be loaded into a PC for analysis (software included). It can also be set to take your blood pressure once or automatically take three consecutive measurements and provide an average which should be more accurate. However, after comparing the readings to my standard arm cuff machine and with the one at my doctors office I found the Systolic measurement to be about 17% higher."
2,"Nice idea, but reads too high.","I was looking forward to the convenience of this wrist unit, and the ability to download scores, but I found it reads too high consistently. Microlife even replaced it quickly with a new one, but it also reads too much higher than my arm cuff unit. I will only use it in an emergency and will subtract 10-20 points from the BP values. (Also if the battery expires, you lose all the readings and settings.)"
2,"Ok device, worst software on planet","The device is easy to use and very portable. But, it has been many years since I've encountered such poorly designed and buggy software. Many features are not usable... for example: adding comments to the reading history. The button is there but no fields are enables when clicked. The cursor blinks indication entry but typing is not recognized. Even the date field can't be changed. They both remain at 01/01/0001.The USB software is a nightmare. You can't assign COM port so it will interact with other USB software, like my PALM sync program. I guess if this were the only USB device on your computer you may be safe.So, get the monitor but forget about using the software unless you love to solve puzzles."
2,Microlife BP Monitor Review,I have had the unit for a month or so now. It reads consistantly high by 25 mmHg or so when I compare to readings on my Omron meter or the Albertson's meter.
4,Arts and Culture,"Book was in very good shape, the front corners are a little dog-eared. CD included."
3,Art textbook,"The book was in pretty good condition, it was higlighted in many pages, but over all it is descent"
4,Beautiful Images,"I personally felt the best thing about this text book was its beautiful images--the pieces of art are from all over the world, with varied mediums, differing meanings, and from differing time periods. The book is detailed and lengthy--it is not only ideal for those who thrive in artistry, but also for those who are studying the given topic."
5,Perfect!,There is not much difference between the 3rd and 4th edition it isjust what I needed to make it through the course.
3,"I love mine that I got 4 for 3, but:","I got 4 of the mauve when it was buy 4 pay for 3 and only cost total of $33.80 for all 4. I do love mine at that price, but the coloring is not a pastel pink as in picture it is more of a medium pink no mauve. These wreaths are big great size, and very light weight so will be perfect to hang most anywhere.On the down side the flowering is made up of different size styrofoam balls of white and pink,which does look cheap up close,and several came loose in box during shipping. You will need to shake it before hanging as it does tend to shed a little everytime they are bumped. Looks better across the room,it is obvious they are balls. The lighting is a green christmas cord wtih clear white lights (not frost), so will have to hide cord, especially if you have white walls.Better name would be pink and white lighted wreath."
3,Nice...,"Good looking wreath, nice size. The lights are placed towards the outside only - kind of makes a ring around it - rather than randomly placed throughout. ""Flowers"" are Styrofoam balls - several fell off when unpacking but not much shedding since. Cord is extra long which is nice."
5,Love of the Land,This is easily in my top ten list of books. Wonderful account of growing up in the upper Midwest after the War Between the States. Hamlin Garland writes with a great sense of place and a love of the land.
4,Great Book,"This is a great book from 2 angles: first, it's a great coming-of-age story. Second, as a reader in 2007, it's a wonderful window into the world of 1870-1900s America which was not so long ago, but worlds away.The language is a little formal and flowery, which is funny in light of the fact that Garland broke ground in American literary circles as a gritty ""realist"" writer. But even that serves to draw a more complete picture of the era."
3,A Son of the Middle Border,"It was not what I had expected, too much history and rather 'dry'..I'll try to read it later at a later date."
5,"If you only read one book on this subject, read this one.","Having read numerous books on this subject, I can recommend this as by far the best. Very informative and tightly argued."
2,Out of Date Before it Was Printed,"While there are those who would give this 5 stars even if it featured nothing but dancing elephants, those with any amount of knowledge of the present state of scholarship will find these essays somewhere in the range of speculative-outdated-appalling. Cavin -- the man who invented the ""Jesus had an evil twin who faked the resurrection"" theory -- makes for an intro that may as well have come from Acharya S. Martin and Drange need an education in how an honor and shame society worked. Derrett? I wonder how he gets away with an argument that amounts to racial stereotyping (""Jews are good with money"") in this day and age. Carrier does the watusi to get out of the consensus on the meaning and understanding of resurrection.You know me, then you know where to go."
2,Complete Rip Off,"I bought this CD for 5 dollars used and seriously regretted it ten minutes later. I could have bought 2 Happy Meals or a frozen piece of meat, but what I got was a horrid, rancid comilation of Pretty Boy S**T! This doesn't even deserve 2 stars but I'm nice. There is one decent song on this album, Saturday Night in the USA, which to some may be worth $18.99 but it was definately not worth my five bucks. The ""untouched"" part of these ""UNTOUCHED STUDIO DEMOS!"" really shows. On many songs you cannot hear the vocals, the drums sound like plague-ridden duck being beaten with a pretty boy stick. Leather Boyz is a great song, but this CD destorys it. ALSO! I could sue the label for displaying 15 tracks on the cover when there are actually only 13. They left off 2 songs without even changing the art! In my opinion, Pretty Boy Floyd rules, but dont buy this CD. Get 2 happy meals instead."
3,Bad things happen to bad people,The language is plain and they are easy to understand. If you took away the line breaks they could be read as straight prose. I could not detect any rhythmic or prosodic pattern. They are straightforward imaginary confessions - sort of Joyce Carol Oates mini-horror stories. The bad guys are rather standard liberal targets. It is readable and I found myself turning the pages and keeping on reading which is more than I can say for more edifying and esoteric poetry.
3,winner of the 1999 national book award,"winning the national book award alone is good enough reason to pick this collection up. ""Child Beater"" is another. Ai's early poems are without a doubt her best work. as she got older, her poems just lost most of the skill she exhibited in her earlier collection."
1,A cure for Insomnia,"If this book doesn't put you to sleep, nothing will. Full of vague and windy generalities, and incredible repetition, you won't find out much of anything. But you will be bored."
2,Music,"I guess I was fooled by this first DVD, when I watched the movie the music seemed better. This first DVD is boring to say the least."
3,Hit and Miss,"Some songs, such as, ""My Father's Gun"", ""Come Pick Me Up"", and ""Jesus was a Crossmaker"" are awesome but, some songs like ""Shut us Down"" make you want to shoot the damn cd. I think theirs more bad than good. I'm ordering the second volume and I'm hoping its better than this one."
2,Very like Garden State,"Did'ent think much of the film and the same goes for the soundtrack, its basically a ripp off of the film Garden State which was released last year.For the most part the music has no feeling and its extremely disappointing that Sony have copy protected this CD so that you CAN'T even copy it to your iPod using iTunes."
3,"Oh, Come On!!!","I was so looking forward to the release of this soundtrack. How dissappointing! Good music - BAD technology. I will NOT be purchasing this title until a version is released with copying capabilities. How ridiculous is it, not to be able to play a CD off of your own hard drive!?! 5 stars for the music, but I can't actually rate the product that highly if I can't even play it when and where I want to. I would rather do without Sony CDs, than pay $$ for such an unusable product. Yes, I know I could just use a regular CD player, but that's not the point - and it's not always convenient either."
4,Itunes version is not copy protected,"Sony CDs that are copy protected should not be bought - however this collection is available on Itunes w/out the nasty program - the music is good - I love Patty Griffen's song - one drawback - only one of the Tom Petty Songs that that were in the movie is on this sound track - ""It'll all work out"". ""Learning to Fly"" is Available on his greatest his album if you are interested."
2,I didn't realize it was copy protected--thank God I have a Mac!!!!!,"I confess right now, I didn't even look at the label when I bought the CD. It was half off (can't imagine why!) and I scooped up the bargain because I loved the music from the movie.But hide and watch, the Mac will be the next to fall to these corporate 'viruses' if we don't stop buying disks from Sony."
2,Does anyone know...?,"If we buy the MP3 downloadable album of individual songs instead of the actual physical CD, do we then avoid SONY's malware? Thanks for any help!"
2,bummed out,"I really enjoyed the music from the movie. I liked the song when Drew was 1st driving in the rental car, but I don't know what it was.Also I am majorly bummed that Freebird isn't on ANY of the soundtracks. C'mon! The original was good but that one truly rocked my socks! Does anyone know where I can find that version?"
1,One of life's little ironies,"Wait a sec. The soundtrack from ""Elizabethtown"" is COPYPROTECTED? How weird is that? Think about it."
2,"good history, poor detail","If your looking for a colerful history of the Impala, this is it. However, if you want detailed information on the '94-'96 Impala, keep on looking. The author gives enthusiastic reviews that I have to agree with completely, but if you want detailed information such as the total number of Impala's manufatured or overall vehicle performance, this book just won't do."
3,DVD-ONLY REVIEW,"For those who wonder about the contents and quality of the dvd :14 videoclips of some of the most famous songs from this british after-punk band lifted from the Once Upon A Time and Twice Upon A Time respective VHS releases. It's a quite short and incomplete dvd at a meagre 57'of total duration and the volume and tonal quality varies dramatically from one clip to the next making for constant adjustments but that was to be expected since the clips span different eras and are quite low-budget affairs.Picture is just OK 4:3 on most clips and there's a 5.1 option but no extras of any kind which could have rounded up a nicer package.But what annoyed me the most were the mixes; little bottom end and the voice is irritatingly loud in the mix, so if you want to hear the instruments at realistic levels you'll have to put up with strident, ultra-loud vocals. This is not the case on the studio cd mixes, so can anyone enlighten me on the subject ?For die-hard fans only."
2,preston anti-franco,"PAUL PRESTON IS NOT OBJECTIVE IN HIS BOOK ""FRANCO"". HE MAKES FRANCO APPEAR WORST THAN HILTER. EXAMPLE IN REGARDS TO ONE OF HIS SOURCES - JOSE MARIA GIL ROBLES- notes 114 and 120 on pages 592 and 590. PRESTON MAKES IT APPEAR THE GIL ROBLES KNOWES WHAT FRANCO STATED AT A TIME WHEN GIL ROBLES HAD LEFT SPAIN AROUND 1936-39 IN A PERIOD IN THE BOOK OF 1949. THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES. I SUSPECT MANY OF HIS NOTES AND SOURCES. IF I AM WRONG OR I DID NOT UNDERSTAND PLEASE LET ME KNOW. PS. I suspect that many of his sources are not creditable. Too many of his secondary sources appear to be primary sources."
3,"A Well Written Reference Work, mostly.","This is a good book for fan's of Children's Literature, and it is definitely worth having, but it is not the absolute best. While reading this book keep in my mind that Carpenter puts in a great deal of his own opinion, and not what is neccesarily the general opinion in literary circles. (On a side note, it is my opinion that Carpenter's biography of Tolkien, a seperate book, is the difinitive Tolkien Bio and a must for all Tolkien fans.) But as I said in the title it is a well written work and worth having. So, if your favorite authors include C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, Madeleine L'Engle, Beatrix Potter, E. Nesbit, George MacDonald and many more besides I would advise getting this book. For this same subject I also highly reccomend The Encylopedia of Fantasy and The Encylopedia of Sciene Fiction."
1,Stating the obvious.,"I do not wish to disrespect dead people but I believe Mr.Locke deserves it here.I picked up the book expecting to read a masterpiece and what I get is Locke playing Captain Obvious. I did not even bother to read the first part of the book where he attacks Robert Filmer using Biblical verses. The second part of the book should not be spent on because what Locke is stating is already so obvious that you don't need to read a book about it. I suggest reading his book ""An Essay Concerning Human Understanding"". It is much better."
2,Not useful,"I was excited to receive this book. I've dabbled with pneumatics for years but wanted to take my skills up a notch. This book did not help.It is poorly written, managing to simultaneously be too confusing for a beginner (spending pages on minimizing water in your system, without ever telling you why you care) without being informative for someone with a bit of experience (if you can read the diagram on the side of a solenoid valve then this book will have nothing to teach you).The chapter on air motors and air bearings, which I was looking forward to reading, contained no content at all and literally suggested the reader should ""google these terms to learn more""... If I wanted to google terms, why would I buy this book?Try another book -- this isn't the one."
2,"very, very basic","This book is very, very basic. The author describes rudimentary pneumatics but leaves out any explanation. For example the valve symbols are shown but there are no descriptions what the inlets and the outlet are and what the various valves are used for. There is an ""extensive"" (for the book) description to filters and separators, but again no description why this is done. The writing style is rather flippant and condescending. I learned more from the Wikipedia article (and the links therein) than from this book."
2,Bad taste!,"This protein is the worst-tasting I have tried so far. I've tried mixing it with water, skim milk, and even in a shake, but I had trouble getting past the taste. I wouldn't buy this brand again!"
2,"Well, It Should've Worked...","A high school English teacher, I assigned The Castle of Otranto to my 50 sophomores. They're a tough sell when it comes to books. (They're against them.) Still, I thought these kids might be interested in the one book that defined gothic horror, a genre much beloved by teenagers today. Forget it. They hated it. What was spooky to Walpole is hokum to youngsters who consider The Texas Chain-Saw Massacre one of the Ten Best Movies Ever Made. In desperation, I tried to teach the book as an example of 18th century camp, but campiness isn't a concept a 15 year old appreciates. Can 60 tenth-graders all be wrong? Yes, of course they're wrong. It should've worked, but it didn't. Next year, it's back to The Mayor of Casterbridge. That'll teach 'em to complain."
4,Visit good storytelling,"A simple ghost story of old... not blood and guts. Easy motion storytelling alows no dead spots and no dense spots where you can't go on. Really, an nice way to get a story without the modern drag-out-knock-down gorging of today without sacrificing content."
3,Doesn't have all the Prefaces,"This is probably not important to many readers, but it might be helpful to know that this free Kindle edition only contains the Preface to the first edition. It is missing the Preface to the Second edition, which caused a bit of a scandal by revealing that the work was entirely fictional (ie, a hoax), and which is worth reading."
3,Oxford World Classics edition,"I have to agree with the consensus of reviewers here: If you are looking for an excellent Gothic novel to read, this one is not it. If you are studying the history of Gothic literature and aesthetics, this novel is fundamental.I want to recommend highly the introduction by E.J. Clery to the Oxford World Classics edition. Clery provides a survey of the various ways of interpreting the novel, and amply explains the novel's strengths and weaknesses in the context of the different interpretations. With this approach, the reader finds ways of making sense of the peculiar novel within the context of its time and its author's possible intentions."
3,Probably better in its day,"This book, like Pamela for feminist literary history, is important due to the fact that it was the first gothic novel ever written. The voice is a good one for the story, deep, reverant, dramatic; the writing is of excellent breed as well. With that said, however, so much has been ripped-off from this novel, and into novels that we've already read, that the story itself comes off as a bit cliche, not to mention ridiculous. Although the hyperbole of the novel is based off sybolic intentions, the best that one can say about this piece is that it lit a torch for future great novels--not that it's so much a great novel on its own two feet. Worty of reading if you care about the history of novels in general, but if you're looking for a great gothic novel this shouldn't be a first choice."
3,Free SF Reader,"A nasty accidental death is not a good thing to have happen on yourwedding day, particularly when it happens to the guy you were going to marry.After this unfortunate event, the father of the dead groom decideshe needs to marry the now did not quite make it to widowed woman. There are financial reasons, for this, of course.Plenty of supernatural and other sorts of suspense follow."
2,Historical artifact,"This is interesting as a historical milestone since it seems to have been the first Gothic novel ever written. As such I guess it should arouse some mild interest. I suppose it can be seen as a real creative achievement since it's not derivative of anything except for ghost stories and Shakespeare.It is NOT particularly entertaining for its own sake. Pioneering as it may be, it is nowhere near as exciting or interesting as many stories that owe it something. The language is stilted, characters flat, and plot ridiculous and at times hard to follow. But if you want to see where horror and the whole gothic theme came from, here it is..."
2,The only value is that it was the first gothic book writen.,This is a mix of a mexican soap opera with some ideas copied from Shakespeare about ghouls and pictures that walk.
3,Required Gothic Lit,"This was recommended that I read this before The Mysteries of Udolpho. It was perhaps the strangest book I've ever read. It's short, and quick and more than anything else, funny (when I don't think it meant to be). And the presentation of female characters shows that it absolutely was written by a man."
2,A college paper,"I wrote a paper years ago about the origin of the Gothic tale, using the Monk, The Castle of Otranto, and finally Frankenstein. For some reason I skipped the works of Ann Radcliff and still haven't read her 40 years later. I found the Monk and Frankenstein much better.The castle of Otranto was really the first ""Gothic"" novel but it is lack luster at best. The mood and the setting that Walpole sets is good, but the tale is somewhat lame (or insipid as I wrote in the paper) and the characters lack development. If you are only going to read one, read Mary's book. However, The Monk was a fascinating tale for it's time. If you read the Castle, read it early in the day because late at night you will fall asleep."
4,Oddly fascinating!,This book is pretty good. Walpole conjures up some pretty strange images and scenes which really puts your imagination to work.
5,Best edition available,"Finally someone has provided us with a readable, absorbing, and correct edition of this novel. I've always found this a difficult work, but the introduction and notes are wonderful, reading the book as camp and as opera. The hundreds of errors in the Oxford University Press edition are finally corrected here, and the appendix (providing 75 years of responses to Walpole's romance) makes for hilarious reading. Without question the best available teaching text."
3,A good but not brilliant ancestor of gothic stories,"This is considered to be the first gothic story and it does set up many of the classic elements in terms of being in an old castle, the supernatural and some kind of old mystery that haunts the place and must be resolved. However, it is quite hard to read as the writing is extremely dense - too much to be enjoyed fully as a gothic novel. It's great historical value but in terms of enjoyment, this has the density of a much more serious work without the profoundness."
3,CCNP: Switching Study Guide,"I am disappointed in the quality of this work. It is not up to par to Todd's other books, especially his CCNA book. I was very pleased with his CCNA book and it helped me pass with over a 900 score. The questions in this book, however, did not mirror the questions that I had on the test at all. Luckily, I had taken the class and knew much of the information, and I passed with an 840 score, but Todd's book was not much help. For a technical reference, it is good, but for the CCNP switching test, I would spend my money elsewhere.Curtis"
5,Excellent,"Scored me a 903 after 1 week of studying. I just read the book, and used the flashcards. There were some confusing points, like acronyms that would pop up, and not be explained until the next chapter, but all in all, it is excellent for a study guide."
3,Not as good as I expected,"After having used various other books by the same author in the past, this book was a bit of a disappointment. I missed the chrystal clear explanations that were present in some of his other books.All in all it isn't a bad book, but it has opened my eyes to competing study guides, where I would have gone Sybex/Lammle without hesitation in the past."
4,"Good book, but look out, test looks completely different.","This was the only book I used for my switching exam and I passed. I liked the book since its easy to read than other books, but this book has lots of spelling and some content errors (and lack of details). One thing I like to stress is that be in for big surprise when you take the test as questions were nothing like the questions in this book(surprised). Only reason that I passed was that I think this test was quite easy (compared to other tests and if you have experience). I think 50% of the questions were answered based on this book and rest from deduction and experience. I would recommend this book based on following criteria: 1 - if you have experience then this book is good since its easy to read book. 2 - if you don't have experience (or little) then I would recommend going with this book plus one other guide (I used sybex/boson combination with good result for routing). Good luck!"
5,The Best but Discontinued,"I think this is the best eyeliner I have ever used. It goes on smooth with no tugging. Contrary to the other review i saw here, you CAN sharpen it. I have used this eyeliner for a few years but now I see they have discontinued it."
3,Decent Story But Some Weak Parts,"I was going through an old X-Men kick and reading a bunch of TPB's of old X-Men stories like Phoenix Saga, Xtinction Agenda, etc. This was one of the ones I picked up and hadn't read before, and I came away a bit disappointed. The story itself is interesting and obviously had some major implications for the X-Men's history, but it was hard to get into the artwork (normal for the period, but I hate it now) and I also hated the parts with Thor and Power Pack. Thor was ok but it's an X-Men story and I felt his role wasn't particularly interesting.I also didn't have any knowledge of the Power Pack and who they were, so encountering a kid story in the middle of the book was a bit jarring and not something I really cared for. Mutants are getting killed left and right and we see Wolverine doing his thing but we're stuck reading about these random kids. Not my cup of tea, but I'm sure others don't mind as much as I do."
4,An excellent blend of in your face rock with deep soul blues,"Great White does it again. This may be the best yet. With bluesy rock oriented hits like ""Twice Shy"" to the down and dirty rhythms on ""Mista Bone"" and ""Hiway Nights"" to the fabulous acoustic ballad "" She Only"". This album has something for everyone. This album really shows off the wonderfull guitar playing of Mark Kendall and the vocal range of singer Jack Russell."
1,Lacks Talent,This album is really bad. Great White could never really cut it as a good rock band and is easily eclipsed by their betters. Nothing is really any good on this album. It's a waste of time. Buy something else.
4,Great rock cd,"I only wanted this cd for a couple songs, but all the songs were great. I'll get more music from this band."
4,"Noritaki, Rothschild sugar bowl","I bought this as a gift for someone who has this pattern. If this were for me, I would have prefered a larger opening for a shell bowl type sugar spoon, to get easily out of the bowl without spilling."
4,Not as good.,"In my quest to find the perfect nightlight for specific rooms of my house, I came across this. I didn't expect it to be as bright as15A Hallway Lightbut at least brighter thanFeit Electric BPC7/LED Three LED Night Light Bulb with Candelabra Base, Clear, 2 PackThey seem about the same level of brightness. I returned it and brought theseMaxxima MLN-50 5 LED Night Light With Sensor (Pack of 2)which are so much brighter than this and still focus the light straight forward. This NL/outlet combo has only two tiny LED bulbs compared to the light in the first link which has three larger bulbs upon closer inspection. And I didn't see the purpose of the tamper protection, because I was still able to easily insert a small key into the slots. (before installing into the wall) This would be fine in a bathroom or any place that doesn't require bright lights."
2,Disappointing,"I thought the book itself was going to describe exactly how to do the Vivation technique, but turns out -- I was disappointed to learn -- that it very superficially describes the technique, and then goes into a sales pitch, more or less, for having a session with a Vivation professional. So I am returning the book. Also, the breathing technique he seems to be describing, the Circular Breath, seems no different from very well-known pranayama I am already doing, not so dissimilar from rebirthing."
4,Definitely a keeper...,"I am about to make my way to Prague for a TOEFL course and could not have researched this school without reading this book. He gives all the options and why and why not. His advise on looking for jobs and how to write CV's is extremely helpful, especially for Americans, as it is not the same as a resume. A little biased to the Cambridge certificate and affiliates but he worked for them so whatever.... definitely a must if you are just trying to figure out where to start with your TOEFL."
4,Cuts to the Chase,"I found this book to be very concise and full of great info. The only drawback was that I found it to be pricey...otherwise i would have given five stars. But i guess if you land that dream job, the price is inconsequential."
5,TEACHING ENGLISH OVERSEAS: A GUIDE FOR AMERICANS/CANADIANS,"After reading the book, I found it very informative and would suggest the reading to any prospective ESL teachers that want to be informed of the industry. The only thing I didn't particularly care for was the author was rather biased when it came to the CELTA program. He never mentioned the actual names of other teacher training courses. Since I am taking the CELTA anyways, I still give this author an A+++++ since he is an experiened TEFL professional who seems to be quite knowledgeable and notable individual in the industry. Thumbs up!!!"
5,Found a job in a week,"Thanks to this book and despite me having no teaching experience or certification, I found a job within a week. This book is concise and contains many links to websites I could not find on my own. The job I received is in Mexico and they are paying for my plane tickets and rent when I get there, along with a nice salary. I am very pleased. If you want a job then I would suggest you look here first."
3,Interesting but only for gym-goers,"Though others have complained about the writing style, I didn't find it as annoying as the fact that you need to go to a gym to do all the exercises - thus the rating of 3 (sorry)."
5,Fabulous! Weight training from a unique women's perspective,"This book does what so many other books try to do but cannot: encourage women to train for strength and health without talking down to them. The author has presented the nuts and bolts of weight training clearly, with excellent photographs for reference for each exercise. Most meaningfully for me, she presents a truly feminine perspective on what weight training is all about. Many manuals on strength training utilize the language of violence(e.g. ""Blast those pecs!"") to encourage the reader; Karen Andes uses the language of peace. And if you think it doesn't work to do it that way, just look at her photos through the book - she looks fabulous, and more importantly, demonstrates through the book that strength training does as much for you on the inside as it does on the outside."
4,"So far, so good",I got this book last week and it's great. I'm giving it 4 stars because you can't do all the exercises unless you join a gym and use machines (I want to work out at home with free weights). I've struggled with weight and lack of exercise my whole life but this is a very inspirational book. I would suggest that EVERY woman read it.
5,Timeless!,"That's what amazes me about this book is that even though I've been using it for over ten years, the material and guidance remains valid. Whenever I've had a rough day or just don't feel like I can work out, Karen's book delivers a strong reminder about what I can accomplish. Her guidance on feeling comfortable in the gym and the chapters on working through emotions helped me feel OK with taking care of my self and needs, even when I felt less than ready to work out or needed to take a day off."
2,Lasted only 10 months with normal use in Tungsten T3,"I purchased this battery April 8, 2010 and installed it in my Tungsten T3 shortly thereafter. It is now March 16, 2011. My T3 stopped taking a full charge several months ago, and charges started lasting for shorter periods of time (usually a few days, much less than normal for my experience with this PDA).Now the T3 will not charge or wake up at all. I'm assuming the battery is the problem. Possibly I was sold ""new old stock."" I understand that Li-Polymer batteries have a limited ""shelf life"" even if unused.My previous battery replacement in this same Tungsten T3 lasted from 8/2006 to 4/2010, over three years rather than 10 months."
3,Good introduction with some technical problems,"A good introduction to fencing, but some sections are presented hapahzardly. Almost every photograph show fencers covering the target area with the off-hand, a crtical no-no.The saber chapter was the best of the three main section. A nice reference for people picking up the sword, but it falls short as a coaches or fencer's textbook."
3,"Rudimentary, not very useful beyond the first few lessons.",This is a very rudimentary book. I prefer something with more depth and detail. This was definitely not worth the money
2,"Makeover, modeling, ad nauseatum...","The part that caught my attention was when the Fabulous Five feel sorry for Mona, who seems gloomy and is often treated like an outcast. Taffy pretends to be her friend at times, then dumps her cruelly. Well...the Fab Five think that Mona's troubles are wrapped up in her ""homely"" appearance and plain clothes. I don't blame Mona for not wanting to be a ""charity case."" I wish Betsy Haynes had written a book specifically about Mona because Mona reminds me of Mary Anne Spier from the Baby-Sitters' Club series. The stupid thing is that the Fabulous Five do butter up Mona and win her over and when they do, they invite her over to Jana's apartment and give her a makeover as if that would solve Mona's self-esteem troubles. I was touched when the Fabulous Five discover that Mona entertains animals at the animal shelter. Mona should be developed more as a character and a person. I have the feeling Mona would fit in better with the Baby-Sitters' Club than the Fabulous Five."
1,Disappointing,"For a non pagan just wanting to know more about neo-paganism, the book was a disappointment.The rancor runs so deep on all things Christian there are times you can forget which religion the book is supposed to be about. To read it you would think that he was describing belief systems defined more by how they were persecuted than by the beliefs themselves. Far from the ""scholarly work"" it misrepresented itself as in many areas."
2,Where are the a capella songs?,"A message to Neri per Caso: I am a big fan because you are the best a capella group ever. So, please, don't try to be another boys-pop-group. There are enough of those guys around and this is not what I expect from NPC.OK, the CD has TWO a capella songs, but, again, this is not why most people (outside Italy, at least) buy NPC CDs. They may be the Italian N'Sync, but if they go through this path NPC will be just another group around.I know it must be hard to come with one a capella CD after another but we waited for so long..."
3,It was...er...,"MAN OH MAN, you guys really rock but what makes you guys so special is your wonderful talent in the acapella technique... But really have to hand it to you guys for making the songs with music still have your mysterious charm! Come on...you guys can do better than this. HOWEVER Don't worry I'll ALWAYS support you : D"
4,Great harmony sound,Another great album by this talented bunch but they have lost a little of the magic that made the first one so special. More instruments have infiltrated this time but still plenty of vocal harmony and a great version of Good Morning Sunshine. I won't desert you boys!!
4,Its alright,This was a gift for someone who likes the blues and it was good I like it and there was one particular song that I really liked.
4,"beautiful story, lousy copy","A wonderful story that hooks you right out of the box...with all the usual ""you are there"" Trollopian visual descriptions. I think that Trollope was one of the world's great novelists and he does not disappoint here. But the publisher! As noted by other reviewers, misspellings, malapropisms and atrocious punctuation abound and really ticked me off considering the price of this book! There is totally no excuse for this slovenly editing. I think it was done by a computer program...another victim of outsourcing. Another thing is that although the listing is for Dodo press, the copy I received from Amazon was from BiblioBazaar!? So the listed publisher is probably not at fault."
3,Belton Estate- Heir or Error Apparent?,This novel of Trollope's poses his usual question: will the middle class heroine find true love in spite of various social/emotional conflicts? In this case his poverty-stricken heroine has two suiters and must decide between the one she loves and the one who loves her. The dilemma is a tricky one since the man she loves has culture and wealth and breeding but no strong feelings for her; while the rougher and uncultured man who loves her is truly devoted to her. Trollope has written better paced novels but this one does hold the reader until the solution is reached.
4,Not so bad,"Amazingly, somehow Trollope paints almost all the characters in thestory in a sympathetic light! If you like any of Trollope's novelsbefore, you are sure to find this entertaining."
2,Cool I guess,"This little trick is cool, but I dont ever really use it. it seems kinda awkward and you cant let them look at it which turns me off."
1,Not a good value,This is just two pencils with a page or two of finely printed instructions. Your child needs to be really motivated to do magic to get anything out of this. I would not say this is a very good value for the money.
3,It okay,The picture doesn't show both the pencilsI got it for a gift. He enjoyed it and had fun with it
5,Pros and cons,Proslittle kids love itgood for beginnersinstructions are easy to understandConsthe #2 gets scratched to easlyis a little hard
4,Good Ol' Engelbert,"This album takes you back into the past-right into the 1970's. Most songs I've heard of,and that's the reason why I bought the album. Some songs I did not recognize,but overall I enjoy listening to this album."
3,Forgotten Gold,"I wish when labels decide to put a difinitive collection of an artist out, that they would really look at the product and the fans to make the best collection. Although this is basically in cronological order and mostly his Decca Records hits and LP tracks, it only includes 1 Epic single as the last song, After The Lovin'. If they took out some of the filler tracks, they could have easily replaced them with much stronger tracks and hits forgotton on Epic. That would have been a great selling point for an Ultimate Englebert! There was a track called Beautiful Baby that was not a single but became a fan favorite. As well as the #1 AC single This Moment In Time! Other important hit missing are I Believe In Miracles, Goodbye My Friend, Love's Only Love, Til You And Your Lover Are Lovers Again and perhaps the interesting single from 1996 Lesbian Seagull."
5,I have every one of Engelbert's albums!,This CD set is incredible. I have all these songs on his original Paret LP's which a friend sent. I have them all on my computer. Engelbert is very popular in Sri Lanka and I grew up with his music. I'm 28 now and listen to him frequently. His strongest LP is A Man Without Love from 1968. So many beautiful songs on it and his vocal range is powerful. Truly a must have!
5,long time fan loves this,"I bought this for my mother, she absolutely loves this collection of ""the old songs"""
5,Learning for the Future,"Michael Pertschuk's book is a must-read for anyone who is working to accomplish significant social change in America, particularly on issues where there is a powerful, monied opposition. He gives us critical insights into how a progressive movement can hurt itself by unneccessary personal attacks and ideological rigidity. He also teaches us how a progressive movement can overcome these obstacles and become a powerful unified force for good in our society. Over the years, I have seen the kind of internicine warfare so artfully described by Mr. Pertschuk undermine efforts to reduce gun violence and health care expansion. I hope that his book will help all of learn how to work together to achieve our common goals."
1,Not enough information -,"Niagara cycle's website says this about this tire:* 26"" x 1-3/4""* Wire Bead* Black Wall* ISO diameter 571mm* *Note: This is NOT the same diameter as a decimal tire size, such as 26"" x 1.75""*Nothing of the sort is stated on Amazon's page for it. I bought this with the intention of it replacing my current tires which are wearing out, that are 26"" x 1.25"" (the inner tubes being used support up to 1.75""). If you're looking at this for that purpose, look elsewhere. And -always- look for more information on the product before purchasing from Amazon.This tire also does -not- fit a 26"" rim."
5,Perfection In A Jar,"I first used this product in 1991, when you could only purchase an industrial size jar (it was appx. $25.00 in 1991). It lasted forever, and there was so much, I used it all over!I've used so many products, in all price ranges, over the years and none can compare to Eterna 27. I have extremely dry skin due to thyroid disease, which would normally cause patches of flaking. When I found Eterna 27 (AGAIN, FINALLY) a few months back, I thought I'd give it a try. It cleared my dry patches and rejuvenated my skin. At 45, I look 10 years younger because of my skin. I am not giving all the credit to Eterna 27 (I've always taken care of my skin and stay out of the sun), but since using it again, my skin has the resilience and tone it had way back when.I would HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone at any age!"
3,Nice product but not moisturizing enough...,"I was looking for a moisturizer and I decided to try this cream. I have a dry skin, especially during the winter time. So far, it is not moisturizing as well as I wanted it to do. Hope it will, at lease, do its job during the summer time."
2,The Lament Of The Neo-Realists,"Richard Haass attempts to distinguish himself from the neocons. Aside from form, however, the substance really isn't any different. Both begin with the assumption that American Imperium is a requirement for peace and prosperity and any real deviation means *global* catastrophe. Any suggestion that American Imperium itself is the problem is simply beyond the pale, and is dismissed by all sides of american foreign policy elite (neocons and neorealists) as ""unserious"" or worse. Neocons and neorealists are 2 sides of the same coin. The ""argument"" between them is kabuki theater. A pointless handwringing melodrama, signifying little and meaning even less. At their core, both are motivated by a proconsul's view of the world where the only future of humanity worth living is one where america's elite, and the children of america's elite, are the one's calling the shots.It's not a view shared by the rest of the world."
2,This book is really little,"Having gotten back from Natchez, I ordered this for my wife as a momento. It is, like my wife, really small. It is, again like her, very colorful. However, unlike her, it is unsuitable to the topic it tries to tackle. Too much ground is covered, too few pictures that are too small, no real text, yadda yadda. Don't waste your money, save up for a big coffee table book on Natchez. Better yet, go see the town, it's incredible (like my wife)."
2,Too sweet!,"Received this today and it is way too sweet. It smells VERY similar to Jessica McClintock perfume. My mother happens to wear Jessica so ""Happy"" will be going to her for Mother's Day. I will say that it lasts a LONG time (kind of making me sick). I sprayed it on to test several hours ago and it's still going strong, just like the Jessica McClintock."
5,I'm sooo addicted!,"Okay ladies this perfume is ""the bomb!"" The frangrance is sweet,citrusy,light,sexy,lingering,alluring,edible..the list goes on and on. I've yet to find a fragrance that i love to smell on me constantly. I can spray it on as much as i like and not have to give anyone else a headache..when im at work it lingers down the hallway long after ive left..i would drink it if i could! I also get the clinique happy in the body butter..mmm oh so yummy!"
3,Happy bubbly,"I loved it, but the thing is, I don't like smelling like everyone else....But it still smells good--upliftingly, bubblingly good."
5,A total Godsend for me.,"An incredibly accurate mic with low noise and a great cutoff. Right out of the box and into a friends Canon AVCHD via a hosa XLR to 1/8 in adapter and I was rocking with excellent quality, even in a super noisy room. I was still able to hear my subject beautifully without almost ANY white noise.Do not delay, buy now. Do not buy the cheaper the models, you will want to shoot yourself. Pay the money for a great and very handy mic.I'll probably still pick up an Hn4, but for now, I can at least be productive without having to worry about embarrassing myself infront of my clients.Thank you for making such a great tech tool guys!"
5,A Professional Mic for a Budget Price,"The microphone itself is made of sturdy metal, with an unscrew-able bottom portion for a single AAA battery for power. The quality of this microphone is really beautiful, and could be used on camera, as part of a dual-system setup, or even for desktop recording. The microphone also does a great job of blocking out background noise (cardioid pickup pattern), and the audio is crystal clear. I wish there was an On/Off switch on the mic - it's a bit annoying to remove the battery after each use, but that's easily overlooked due to the the great mic quality for the price. Top notch."
4,Great microphone,this mic works great. i got it to use for video things and i have been getting great audio with it. the only bad thing is the the case is oversized. it kinda sucks not having a perfect fit storage container
4,Big enough for all my pills!,"I have to take a large number of supplements, and they just don't fit in most pill boxes. This one works for me... it even has enough room for my calcium citrate wafers, which just don't fit in anything else I've found."
2,"Not what I was looking for,","This was not what i was looking for, not easy to use and was bigger then i thought it would be. I needed something to set on my counter, this is in the way. Hard to open."
5,Bull Halsey book,"My husband loved the book, he said it was outstanding. The book was extremely well written. Thanks, Thanks, Thanks, Karen"
4,"Gutsy, primeval, courageous!","Great book about a great admiral who was not whom he seemed to be. Don't think I would have liked the person, but as an admiral he ranks right behind Nimitz and Spruance! The three of them astound me!"
4,Bull Halsey,I really enjoyed this book and looked forward to it each evening. If you are a student of history this is one you just need to read to open up your knowledge of the WW II in the south pacific. It will also may you want to know more about many of the characters of the era...
2,Not what is pictured,"I ordered this because it was suppose to be a ""Genuine Dell"" adapter. The photo even shows the Dell logo. What I received says ""replacement AC adapter"" no Dell logo.Genuine Dell PA13 PA-13 130 watt AC charger / adapter for Inspiron and XPS M NotebooksThe cords are shorter than my original it runs hotter and the PC power plug does not fit very securely. Apparently this is the same junk being offered by some other vendors."
3,Laptop charger,Item works perfectly but didn't at 1st because the company I ordered it from only sent me 1 side of the charger and not the full item I paid for. I was very upset to receive that since ordering this I know I will never do business with them again! I needed the charger to completely use my laptop to finish work before weekend was up so had to go out to a pc/repair store and pay more money for that end that plugged into the AC outlet. Other than that item works fine and then almost a week later I received the other end they forgot to send so now I have 2 of them because of bad customer service...terrible
1,This is a very poor product.,"I purchased this product three months ago (April 2012) and it has stopped working. I am now spending another $25 to purchase another one from a different supplier. What a waste of money. I expected this product to last quite a bit longer than it did. I have two Dell laptops that I can use with this charger, and the problem occurs with both. When booting up either one it indicates it cannot recognize the adapter and proceeds to state it is plugged in but not charging. On rare occasions I am able to get it to charge, which indicates the adapter is working intermittently. Unfortunately, it does not work 90% of the time. This is a cheap piece of crap and I recommend that people look elsewhere for an AC adapter."
5,"Works, yet doesnt.","I was under the assumption that VoltsXAmps=watts. This charger, which is the same ""wattage"" as my XPS-17, is not recognized. The laptop then says ""will not charge, will run at reduced performance"".These are chargers from older Pentium 3 based laptops. Unless you need these for jut extended laptop use without charging, pass."
4,New Mythology,"This collaboration between Roger Zelazny and Jane Lindskold, while not entirely seamless, is very smooth. As one would expect of a Zelazny book, the characters and settings are wildly inventive. The virtual world, populated by living programs and mythic deities, is attempting to take physical reality in the ""real"" world. This is only the background plot. Much of the opening deals with a deal with a devil -- or Death, and the rest of the novel is involved with the consequences. Not quite as taut as, say, Lord of Light, the novel is nevertheless excellent. The novel would deserve a five-star rating if I were comparing it to the work of almost any other writer, but Zelazny can only be compared to Zelazny."
3,Not up to snuff!,"I really wanted to like this book. I was a big fan of the Amber series and thoroughly enjoyed his writing. Donnerjack had huge potential but never seemed to get were you wanted it to go. I was bored through the first third of the book but because of the writer stuck in out knowing that he'd tie it all up in the end and make it really work for us. In brief, I barely enjoyed reading this and wish I would have made another choice for my 6 bucks! However, Roger Zelaznys passing has definately left a gaping hole in a genre that has consistenly failed to grab me like it did in the old days! Maybe it's just me getting old!"
4,Zelazny's last,"A tech guru, avatars, a journalist, a thief and various representations of ancient religions make entries in this book. Death wants a son, and through the wonders of technology, can have one. The tech guru falls for an avatar, and death gets involved.Zelazny wrote part of the novel, the rest was written by Lindskold at the request of Zelazny's widow. The book is rather good, has humour and fine development. For the naysayers who decry the combination of authors and believe that Lindskold somehow ruined Zelazny's writings, just remember, not everyone appreciated Zelazny so much as his fansbase did. I truly loved his writing, but I was also the person in my family who did so."
2,"Good for the first half, but fizzles.","I agree wholeheartedly with the review here by Phil Thwing. Essentially, the book starts out in classic Zelaznyish fashion but suddenly shifts over to something else about half way through. Very disappointing. The first half is full of depth and then the second half turns shallow. About the only good thing you can say about the ending is that it seems to tie up all the threads. But, there's no satisfaction to it. I wish people would stop trying top publish a dead man's unfinished works. It just degrades his real legacy."
4,HELL'S KITCHEN Season 1 RAW & UNCENSORED,"HELL'S KITCHEN fans, if you love HELL'S KITCHEN as much as I do I highly recommend you order your copy of HELL'S KITCHEN the RAW & UNCENSORED DVD version. The RAW & UNCENSORED version shows what Chef Gordon Ramsay says with out the bleep sound. I'm giving this a 4/5 because logo's are being censored for some reason and I thought it wouldn't be blurred out because this was a "" UNCENSORED "" version so in the end logo's are still censored. I sure hope logo's aren't going to be censored in the later RAW & UNCENSORED HELL'S KITCHEN DVD's. Hope this review helps you out when you think about purchasing your copy of HELL'S KITCHEN season 1 RAW & UNCENSORED, also make your money worth it buy the RAW & UNCENSORED version not a censored version. UNCENSORED version = better."
5,Hells Kitchen season 2,amozon delivered this product much faster than anticipated. This is an excellent show if you have never watched you will enjoy this.
1,didn't work,"After reading the reviews here, I purchased this product. When I intsalled the battery and the seal, it didn't work. Well..it worked only when I pressed down the cap with my finger. How long could I hold? Poorly made."
5,TRAGIC JOYS OF LIVING IN A ROMANIAN MOBILE HOME PARK,"Do not let this title fool you: I was completely cast away and totally spellbound by this movie. It only served to enhance the aura of the film to subconciously have to listen to the Romany language being spoken because it is a lovely and strange tongue. The subtitles were simple but sometimes a bit wrong which led to a lightening up on some of the tragedy the evolves in this story.It is a world we never get to glimpse; a secret chasm of humanity living on the cusp of depricating debauchery and exploitation of its own people. It totally shakes and spins what we know of life. A beautiful sad undulating pathos floats us from frame to frame on this film. The music is superb and I wish it has a sound track because for days it has been echoing through my brain.There is kind of an over done ""thing"" about a bridal veil that sort of floats around like a spectre on a wire...but that does not detract from this hauntingly lovely film. SEE IT!"
3,Very Interesting - up To A Point,"I can see why many people love this movie, but it is just not my cup-of-tea.Great story about a kid growing up the life of a gypsy. Some quite humourous moments and lots of diverse characters.Problem is: It just goes on too long. I lost interest after an hour and skipped much of the last hour. I think I still got pretty much the whole plot though.Great visuals in the 2 main locations, to show the contrast between the Gypsy world and the big city. The acting was ok, sometimes great sometimes not so.Overall, a unique experience to watch, but some of the scenes just drag on. For example, the wedding - I skipped to the bride and groom leaving in the car, must have been a good 10 minutes and really felt like I hadn't missed a thing."
4,Pretty cool,This is pretty cool...the yellow color is more of a blonde and not as vibrant as pictured but still fun. It sheds a little too and as another reviewer mentioned the shape is pretty flat but I sure it could be fluffed. My 16 year old nephew will still love it as he is a diehard Steelers fan and likes to have fun with it! Shipped very fast!
1,A complete waste of time.,"I bought this entire series, and only started reading them in the last few months. I was disappointed with Beverly Bird's book, but this one is completely useless. I read a few chapters and quit in disgust. The adult characters are vapid, the children are overly precocious, and the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic. I find it hard to believe that Joan Elliott Pickart wrote this, because I've read and enjoyed other books that she's written. This book came across as being written by a not particularly talented teenager who has no idea how adults (or young children) really think, behave, and speak. I'm glad to find out that I don't need to read it for any information about the Extraordinary Five, because I couldn't even bear to skim through it."
3,innocence raped with napalm fire,"I was highly disappointed with Tim when I read this even though he did send me three autographed copies, not to mention an autographed ""Chaos & Cyber-culture"" & ""High Priest"". The problem is that this book would never have come into being without me & my share of the writing yet I received scant recognition in the credits, the most said being ""Good Attitudes: Jim Bauer"" & only a few hundred bucks. I am Huck Getty, mostly because I objected to his use of my real name in the story. Much of the writing came from the letters I sent Tim as he reworked it. Other than that I enjoyed the book though it seemed to be poorly plotted or maybe just plain episodic. I was grateful to Tim for allowing me at least some form of publication of my writing. I just wish my role would have been more visible."
4,This Book Needed to be Written!!!,"I agree with the other reviewers here that this book can be a bit clinical, but I believe the historical context provided in the first few sections of the book is necessary in order to understand how and why SM remains such a fear-raising subject even today.What I found most enjoyable about this book were the excerpts and quotes from people within the lifestyle. It IS important, when dealing with something that remains so far removed from and misunderstood by the mainstream, to know that one is not alone.I would highly recommend this book to anyone considering an exploration of SM with their partner. I would also recommend it to anyone who is simply curious about the lifestyle. The authors effectively address many myths about the lifestyle, revealing it for what it can be...a deeply loving, liberating, emotionally enriching and intensely spiritual experience."
4,Compassionate & Re-assuring,This book will affirm all your feelings and fantasies. Thoughtful and well spoken on the BDSM community covers a vast wealth of lifestyle related areas.
1,RIP-OFF SCAM NO PRINTER,"In the product picture, it showed the digital printer.That made this a good value. I bought and when the product arrived, no printer. I complained and they said I could return it for a refund. I ordered online because I don't have time for all the shopping drama. Returning would require more of my time.Bottom line, this product three weeks later still shows the printer in the add and if you don't see the fine print you will be ripped-off just like me."
1,"There is nothing ""rock"" about this video!","This was one of the worse instructional DVD or tapes I have ever bought, and I have at least 40. I thought I was getting a ""rock"" instructional tape and it was everything but. One lesson was a spanish melody in which he suggest it has rock sounds. It doesn't. I was waiting for some bull fight to take place! He does another little riff and says it's a Jimmi Hendrix sound. Ah, NO ITS NOT!! It's not a good instructional tape period!"
1,A Real Disappointment,"Verbose. Few, if any, good ideas. Covers broad range of topics with minimal information of value under each heading. Writing style is painful to read. The author is obviously intoxicated with the exurberance of her own verbosity.Buy ""Major in Success"" by Patrick Combs. This is a valuable book with helpful and insightful ideas."
4,Very Humorous View of College Life,"I am a high school senior and found this book in my library. This was a very comical book that gave me some good advice. Its not the best out there, but very good for the price."
3,"Loved it, until it failed","I bought this nearly two years ago, and I loved everything about it: the weight, design, and even the blue LED. But about 3 months ago, one of the ports stopped working, which wasn't that big of a deal, as I had open ports to spare. But then this week, ALL the ports stopped working, all of a sudden. The LED still glows, but nothing works, so I'm back here, shopping for a different one.I'm giving it three stars because when it worked, it worked. I just wish it would have worked for more than 22 months."
2,Died on me after about a year,This USB hub worked well at first but completed died after about a year (won't power up at all now). Reading a few other reviews suggests there are some quality control issues with these hubs.
3,Not too bad,It works fine as a USB 2.0 hub. I don't understand the power cable and the main usb cable placement. Why wouldn't they place those next to each other so you could twist tie them? Now I have to reach through two cables to plug in USB devices. That's the biggest problem with this device.
5,Can't believe I waited so long,"This is a great product. I've been debating about a usb hub for awhile, and this one had great reviews. Not sorry with the purchase, love that it slides out of the base for easy travel usage."
5,Great design,This is a definite upgrade from my old USB hub. The old one was lighter and moved around on my desk more. This is a very sturdy design that stays in place. It is very sleek and looks very nice since I have a very dark brown desk. It is the perfect combination of functionality and style.
5,Excellent,"This is a heavy, stable product that keeps its position on your desk. The connections are solid and reliable. If you haven't bought a USB hub before, look around the web. Many are inadequate, I'm not sure why. So this one is worth the money."
1,Not built to last,"Got this USB hub to expand the USB connectivity for an Apple Time Capsule to accomodate a printer and external hard drive. Worked as advertised for a while, then the printer would intermittently ""disappear"" without clear cause. Then the Time Capsule complained that the USB hub wasn't powered and when troubleshooting to cable connections, the casing for the Mini USB port broke off into the body of the hub! Disappointed, will not buy again."
5,Essential for Laptop,"I work long hours at home and in my university office. With this excellent add-on, I can move my laptop from office to office and have several peripherals available at each place by merely plugging in one USB cable. I also do not have to worry about running into power limitations. It works well and is completely reliable."
1,"Nice and compact, unreliable power supply.","The power supply started working intermittently on the second day, died totally by a week. I sent it back through Amazon.The basic design would be improved with LED's showing whether individual accessories are working."
3,Works as advertised,Works as advertised although the blue LED light burned out after 3 weeks. Not a big deal although now there is no indication that the unit is receiving power.
1,"Nice design, but didn't last long","A very nice USB hub from a design and construction perspective, works nicely with my Mac, and feels great in your hand due to the sturdy metal casing. However, died after about 12 months, which seems like a very short time."
1,A piece of junk,"It worked great for about two days, then windows would no longer recognize it. Tried it on three different computers and it failed on all three."
2,Nice design but.....,"First, I love the way this hub was designed. It's very sturdy, looks great and has 4 hubs in the rear for items always connected and 3 in front for quick access for things like cameras and cell phones. Unfortunately, sometimes the ports lose connection and I have to unplug and replug the device for it to be seen. I'm on a late model Apple so I'm not sure if the same thing is going on with PC's. Bottom line, if I wasn't having this problem, I would give it 5+ stars."
2,Lasted less than six months,"The initial install experience was good, and I like the form factor.Unfortunately, after less than six months, devices plugged into the hub began behaving erratically. Mouse pointers would jump all over the screen, my SmartPhone couldn't get a consistent connection to synch, etc. The same devices plugged straight into a USB port on the computer worked fine, so it was definitely the hub that went bad. It had the same power source as everything else, so it's unlikely that there was an external cause such as a power surge.I'm now shopping for another hub, and I won't be getting another one of these."
5,USB Hub to the rescue,Great little hub. Heavy metal base to weight it down. Comes with a piece of foam to insert between the hub and base to keep it from sliding out of the base. Blue light special light (Kmart still has blue light don't they? or I'm I really that old?) is covered over with a piece of duck-tape.
3,I think mine was defective,"I read the reviews, it looked like what I needed, so I ordered one. Mine might have been defective, because it was loud, quite loud. I've never had a USB Hub that has made any noise, but this one had a very high pitched whine to it, at all times, also I thought the light was to bright, great size and layout of the USB ports, I don't think I'll try another one of these."
2,Be Warned,"I feel I must pitch in with a long term review of this product. I purchased two of these, one in 2008 and another in 2009. As of August 2011, they have both failed. Nothing lasts forever, but be warned of this relatively short lifespan. The failure seems to be power-related. One hub lost power and was unable to host certain devices; the other caused external drives to intermittently, then permanently disconnect. I thought the issue was with the external drives, but a new replacement hub (different model and brand) is working perfectly."
1,Problems with hub,This is a nice looking hub but i have had the same problems alot of others have had. Most devices i connect to hub either wont work at all or quit after they have been plugged into it for awhile. I even contacted the makers of this device and they said device had something faulty so i wouldnt suggest buying this product.
2,Lasted 1 year,"had it for1 year now, AC socket fell out, havn't been tuggin' at it. it just fell out on its own. opened it up...looked inside. the thing is poorly constructed =\ SIGH. i knew i shud have bought that other one...."
1,Dropped Connections,"This works really well for usb devices which require very little power and are unaffected by power dropping out. But if you try and connect a disk drive, or other items which expect to receive a constant 5 volts at around 200 mA or more, this hub fails. Connections are dropped every few minutes, and then reestablished. But if the connection is to a disk drive, the dropped connection can cause damage to data and perhaps the hardware as well.Look elsewhere."
5,Excellent product,"The second you hold this in your hand you will know that this is not a cheap plastic hub. This hub is VERY well made. The ability to secure this hub with screws was a feature that I had to have. Yet even so, I can slide the hub off of it's mounting plate in a second, and pack it in my notebook case. Some though went into this product."
4,Looks and works good,"Product takes little space on desktop and the little blue light is a beacon in the night, well satisified with the purchase."
1,Did not work out of box; tech support a waste of time; wouldn't even give one star,"In the past I have bought cheap usb ports, usually from Radio Shack. I bought a new work computer, so I thought I would buy a fancy new usb thinking expensive is better, right? WRONG! It was defective out of the box. It was frustrating, but those things happen: It is not the end of the world. However, tech support was totally in denial about THEIR defect. They thought it was the fault of my printer, scanner and eveything else I tried to plug into it and wanted me to contact the manufacturers of those devices. Keyboard!!! Hello??? What good is the usb if it won't even support a keyboard. I guess I was expecting, ""Sorry, is there something we can do to remedy the problem?"" I wouldn't treat my consumers that way and if I did I would expect to hear about it. Well, here it is: Hear it. My recommendation is don't waste your time and money. USB ports ain't rocket science."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"Stopped working after a week. Tried it on several computers/ laptops.....same results. Got a replacement and that one lasted about a month before the USB connectors stopped recognizing various USB 2.0 products (raNdomly). One minute it works, the next it doesn't. Turns out the USB connection is cheaply made. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
4,Terrible packaging!,The USB hub works fine - no problem there. I do wish companies didn't package their products in that hard plastic casing which is almost impossible to open. I spent a long time trying scissors and knives and trying not to cut myself.
3,"Worked Great for a year and half, then died.","The Cables To Go 7 port powered usb hub worked great for a year and half on my Macbook Pro, but the power supply recently died (seems pretty common with these devices). I'm not a fan of the bright blue light (annoying) and the fact that the device ran ""really hot"" (capable of melting stuff underneath it), so today I replaced it with the Kensington Pockethub 7-port purchased at the Apple store and it plugged right in and is working perfectly. Hopefully this one will last!"
1,Using it for Macs? Don't buy it.,I got this for iMac 24 and MacBook Pro (Unibody). I got it on April 2009. Now it is failing. My keyboard and mouse are not recognized. This happens in the middle of a day when I am typing and using my mouse at work. I am very disappointed.It doesn't make a difference if I connect the power adapter or not. Booting from a USB drive does NOT work from the day one.Don't buy it! Buyers be aware!!
1,Destroyed my iPod Shuffle,"This item was either defective or a piece of junk. I plugged it into my cinema display USB port. Neither the keyboard was recognized nor my Shuffle. The shuffle was cycled between recognized, than thrown out, recognized again etc. Always with the warning that the item was not removed properly. Now the shuffle is dead, even the restore software doesn't help anymore. DON'T BUY this piece of JUNK! I paid $18 (will get it back I assume) but now need a new shuffle. Thank god it wasn't my iPhone..."
2,Stopped Working after a month,"I thought this was going to be a nice hub, but after about a month, I noticed devices were not registering on the computer. I investigated and found that the main port of the USB cable (the one from hub to computer) was very loose, wiggled around and was not creating a connection. In fact, the whole silver panel on that side was loose. When I moved the connector around, it had an intermittent connection (USB drive light kept going on and off), then it rebooted my computer.I'll try something else."
3,"Eventually died, like many hubs","+ Simple useful design.- slides out of its base too easily from lateral pressure of connected cables.- blue connectivity light too strong.- ""powered"" feature gave out after about a year. Stopped giving enuf power for Itunes to recognize Ipod.Annoying because at first you don't suspect your hub and you tend to think there is something wrong w your printer or ipod. Seems to be common problem w powered usb hubs. Giving 3 stars only because it is a common hub problem.... could easily be 2 stars."
1,"Bought 2, 1 DOA other one faded overnight",Get the DLINK 7 Port USB Hub. Much better product. I returned both of these.
1,not vista compatible,THis hub looks neat and tidy and is amazing value for money...IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VISTA PC>...WARNING !!! THIS IS NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE !!!It doesn;t say so anywhere on this site until you buy it and connect it to you Vista PC>
2,good at first.... then bad,It only worked for a couple of months. Now windows doesn't recognize it as a proper device and anything plugged into it isn't receiving power or functioning in winows.
2,Feels a lot more solid than it is - warning...,"I had one of these to chain three DVD-R writers off of my laptop, and the hub fell off the back of the desk (still connected.) I would have thought that it would be fine given the solid construction (feels like it was built from one piece of aluminum.) However, the mini-USB connector that feeds it bend sideways and pulled completely out of the hub. Careful not to let this hang by a cable!! Needless to say, it is ruined, and it's in the trash."
5,I'm getting another one.,"I've had one of these for quite a while and I'm going to order another one when I finish typing this.I have had more hubs then I can count, and this is by far the best. Other have gone nuts (a serious technical term).After a month or two one or more ports would have random outages and I could make no sense of what was going on. I have been using PCs since the first month they were released and the other hubs drove me crazy (short trip).This unit, however, just sits there and does what It is supposed to do.And this price is great. It is over $50.00 on the company web site."
4,usb hub,"got this today and i'm impress so far. It's surprisingly small ..so happy about that cause its taking less space on my desk. all my devices are connected without any problems, its really nice , portable (light) like the fact that its slides out of the base, very affordable and got here in one piece. so far I'm really satisfied with this product.besides that i dislike the fact my external hard drive can only be read when its connected to the AC unit(guess the power via usb is not powerful enough). Also, the fact that you have to screw the base to the desk (that's if you want to) i would really prefer some form of adhesive can quickly attach or detach anywhere you fell like especially if you have to move your laptop.These are just two small issues , but besides that, this is an amazing usb hub and would recommend it to anyone who uses a lot of usb devices."
1,Power issues,"I bought this device to connect 5 USB devices: a USB hard drive, 2 printers, and two sync cables (cell phone and MP3 player).My USB hard drive is self-powered via an A/C cord, as are both printers (obviously). I even have the USB hub ""optional"" A/C power cord plugged in. Despite all this, the hub threw an error when i tried to connect my cell phone (a Blackjack II), saying it didn't have enough power to handle the device. I didn't even have my MP3 player connected at the time, and both printers were idle... as was the hard drive.So... this device is unable to provide power with even half it's ports occupied by active devices. I would not recommend this device unless you are connecting devices with near zero power consumption (e.g. a mouse or keyboard.)"
2,"Very pretty, but...","Much better looking than the illustration. Blue power LED is very nice. Slips off the base to make it lighter for traveling. Mine offers no USB connectivity to the computer (computer is unable to see devices plugged into the hub), severely restricting its utility. You might call it a powered paperweight. It does power USB devices, making it handy for charging multiple USB-ported cellphones, MP3 players, etc, when on the road."
4,Works well,"Works pretty good. Dont like bright blue light however, its annoying and wastes electricity. But works well otherwise. Not sure if i would buy again due to light."
2,Disappointed,"Was very excited to get this, being it has 7 ports. Nice & slim. Only thing is I tried to plug in my iPhone, 2 iPods, and they both said this accessory does not support charging. Very disappointing."
1,Read NO Write,"Very Poor Product, nice design. This hub would not work with even a small USB card reader (Transcend RDS5). The card reader works fine when plugged directly into the computer, but not when plugged into this hub. The reader could read a card ok through this hub, but could not write to it. I suspect a bus-power issue. Returned for a refund."
1,waste of time,Very simple. Mine didn't work. Just sent it back.Belkin Hi-Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Lighted Hub Black F5U700-BLK
4,Much better than expected,Solidly built in an aluminum enclosure. Comes ready to mount (optionally). Heavy enough not to be dragged around by the cables attached to it.I like it well enough I may replace an existing 7 port hub with another one of these.Update: I liked it so much I bought a second one.
5,Excellent hub! Definitey Mac compatible!,"I have had this hub for over a year now, and it has worked flawlessly for me on my Macbook Pro running 10.4 Tiger and 10.5 Leopard.The hub basically serves as a docking station for my laptop. I have my iPhone, external hard drives, speakers, and printer hooked up to this device. When I need to take my laptop on the go, I just have to disconnect one cable and I'm off!I only wish there was a way to turn off the super bright LED. My solution was to tape some duct tape over it, which does the trick."
5,PERFECT....,"OK, nothing is perfect, but this little hub comes real close. Bought two of them as we have several laptops and use them in differant locations. One is an older dell with only one usb port. This little hub solved the problems we were having with connections. Compact, light and very easy to mount to almost any surface. Very sturdy construction and nice layout of ports. Works flawlessly and without any special software, just plug it in and go. We use it in the powered mode, but I understand it does a fine job unpowered also. Highly recommend. UPDATE: We have been using these hubs for two years now. One on each laptop and have had zero problems. Speed does not seem affected on any of the devices we have plugged into them. They just seem to the job exceptionaly well. Still highly reccommend."
4,Almost perfect,Works great and small device that you can put almost anywhere. Very nice that there are ports on both sides of the hub -- makes it easier to hook up all of your devices.The only thing that I don't like about this device is the blue light that they put on the top of it - seems pointless!
1,stopped working,Worked fine for about a week. Then some of the ports starting to fail intermittently. I returned it and got something else.
4,"Good Hub, plug n play","I bought this hub because we needed a place to attach two external hard drives, a camera and a camcorder to our computer. Works really well right out of the package (if you can get it open--it's really well packaged) and sits nicely on the desk. It is designed to sit flat with ports on both sides for easy access. A cool blue light on the top lets you know that it's working. Transfer speeds seem fine even when moving large amounts of data. I'd buy this product again."
2,Don't be lulled by the good reviews,"I bought this unit based on these reviews, and it slowly stopped working, one hub at a time, until now, not quite 2 years later, it has died. I'm on an iMac, and did not have any system problems with it, but would prefer to have equipment that will last. We didn't have alot of externals on the unit, but it has been ""plugged in"" so perhaps you should just expect this unit to only last less than 2 years if you buy it."
5,Excellent hub,"I've been using this for a few months and haven't had any problems with it. It's small, compact and very rugged. I have it mounted below my iMac and it blends in perfectly."
4,It is good,"this thing works greatbut the LED light on the top is always oneven tho u turn off ur pc, it is still on"
5,Made in HEAVEN,"This item is made in PC HEAVEN.. well made, efficient, externally powered the spy blue light a pleasure to the eyes ...This item is the best thing since ""SLICED BREAD"" came out ...BUY IT!"
4,Good value for the money,"Pro:1. Work as expected.2. Good speed.3. USB ports powered when computer is off/suspend, if you use external power. (The D-Link 7 port hub does not have this feature!)4. Good priceCon:1. Hard mount is not really useful2. The base should be attached to the hub by default3. Sharp edge if the base is not attached4. Why the LED is sooooooooooo bright?"
5,7 port usb extension,very convient access to 7 usb ports makes connecting ipods etc to the computer very easy unit constructed very well not just a flimsy piece of plastic.
4,Works like a charm,"The Cables To Go 7 Port Hub works as expected. i went with this product because it can be used with or without the AC power. I prefer having the AC power connected when I am charging a device using the usb (like my iPod). w/out the AC power the hub emits a noise when the ipod's connected (i am guessing due to the excess power drainage).My only criticism is that there is no way to stick the aluminium base to a desk (it can be screwed in). There is also the blue light that is quite bright, though you can cover it up using some cloth/paper."
1,Fail!,I bought two of these from Amazon about a month apart. After one year first fell apart. Six months later the second one stopped working.
1,Terrible Product,"Constantly drops devices. It would even freeze my iPhone when plugged in... I don't know why, strange stuff. Wouldn't recommend this to my dog (or yours)."
1,AVOID THIS USB HUB!!!,"I USED to have a high opinion of Cables To Go, and have bought many cables from them and several of these USB hubs, but ALL of the hubs have gone bad, mostly with intermittent operation. At first I thought my external hard drive was bad, but eventually traced it to this hub. The drive works fine with a different hub and the same cable. I know that many USB problems are caused by a bad cable or connector, but this hub is flawed. I've wasted a lot of time trying to track down various other issues that were caused by this product. Now I have several of these in my junk drawer. I switched to the Belkin 7 port F5U307 and it has been solid and is a better design, at least for me. I must say that I am so disappointed that a product I believed in and relied on has failed me."
1,Problem and some accessories connected to port,"I can only use some of the ports for some accessories, but not for others. My printer, external hard drive, and telephone don't connect to the computer when plugged into about four of the seven ports. I returned the first unit and received a free replacement. However, the replacement has the same problems. I was out of town for three weeks immediately after I received the replacement, so I didn't have time to ask for another replacement within the 30 day free return period."
4,A nice little 7 port USB hub,"This hub meets my needs. I read the criticisms in other reviews and I see the same things. But, they are easily solved by the suggestions given in some of the reviews:1. The unit slides freely in the supplied bracket. The easy solution is to put a piece of double sided tape (the thick, spongy kind) on the bottom of the bracket, but leave the film on the top sticky side. Then slide the unit into the bracket. It is nice and snug but can still be slid out if needed. I'm surprised the manufacturer hasn't figured this out!2. The power light is extremely bright. If this bothers you put a piece of tape over it. It's bright enough that you should still see some light through the tape.Other wise this product has worked great. It's compact, has ports on the front and back which means you can put your printers, scanners, etc... on the back and your iPods, cameras, etc.. on the front. Everything I've tried on it works."
