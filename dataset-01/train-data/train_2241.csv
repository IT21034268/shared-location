3,Great cover but a design flaw,"This protective cover is of good quality for the price. There are velcro ties on the outside ends which can be placed around the legs.However, the manufacturer should have a set of velcro ties in the center area due to the long length. The cover does not stay on the couch in wind since the entire front flips up which defeats the entire purpose of the cover. This would cause the cover to rip in higher winds.This is not easily remedied with roping since it causes the cover to pull up in the center.The same cover for smaller furniture items is very nice."
4,Nice cover so far...,"We can only store so many of our pieces out of the weather so I bought this cover for our wicker style couch for $30. Seems nice and sturdy and is a bit more of a heavy duty cover (which is good) to withstand the cold and snow during the winter months.I like that it has velcro straps on the bottom to secure around the legs.I gave it 4 stores just based on initial out of box and fit on couch appearance. Will try and update after winter to see how it held up to either give or take away another star. But, so far... so good."
4,Good for the price.,"Seems heavy duty and fit fairly well, so all in all I am pleased. Hopefully it will stop my cushions from turning green"
2,ELO Live without Jeff Lynn-skip it!!!!,This is 2 cd set of ELO live after Jeff Lynne and other original members left. There is no mention of the live dates or locations and there is one page documentary of ELOII inside. The concert set sounds empty without Jeff Lynne and one will realize why ELO II faded away within a short time. Most of ELO hits are included on the 2 cd set but it is not the same. Good thing I only paid $4 for this set. It doesn't even have Peter Haycock (from Climax Blues Band--guitarist) on it. The one studio album of ELO II had Peter on it and sounded somewhat acceptable but his live set can be avoided with no problem. Check it out only if you are very curious and a devout ELO fan in any group format.
5,Great Product,I've been searching for a cocoa powder that makes great hot chocolate. I used to be able to buy cocoa powder from wholesalers but I can't get it any more. I finally found this on Amazon and we love it. The delivery is great and we love the product. It mixes very well with little waste.
5,Love this Product!,"Quick delivery, Excellent quality. We make vegan raw protein bars for the family & go through it quite quickly."
4,A man of integrity is appreciated,"To read of the man, his stature, his military bearing,being family oriented, and having a deep faith in God is a recipe for the leadership we need today. The general was truly a gentleman; the book is a tribute to his character. It is worthy of re-reading history and the Civil War from Lee's persona. A great book."
5,YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD WHEN...,...You can get a stone hearted atheist like me to listen to this exquisite assemblage of musical beauty in stunned silence with tears rolling down my cheeks. These are songs of the sacred that don't require a belief system. Take it from me.
3,pretty,It did not reach me in a way other things do. I was hit or miss for me although it was not bad
5,Music to nurture the soul,Need to feel hopeful about the world? This music will give you that hopeful feeling.
3,"Good voice, but the venerable texts deserve better pronunciation","Beth Chapman has a beautiful voice which is well suited to the hymns she chose for this record, but her pronunciation of Latin is only beginner's-level, and it shows that this isn't her usual genre of music. Several of the hymns contain pronunciation mistakes which will be off-putting to people who know these songs well; they all bear the sound of Latin as sung with a very American accent.The singers on this recording could have benefited from some pronunciation coaching: classical singers need to learn to pronounce Latin well, but Chapman didn't seem to realize that her singers needed it too."
1,"Loved it, but it was broken...twice!","I really loved the look of this box for my Rudy's ashes. I was terribly sad when the first one arrived with a corner all messed up, even more heartbroken when the second one arrived and the base was split in half. As if I was not upset enough, I cried more each time hey arrived broken. Finally I got a different spinning one and it arrived in good condition."
1,Piece of crap,"First one arrived with areas that weren't stained, second one was the same with a damaged area they tried to cover with stain. The stain is applied so heavy that it looks painted with runs. It should state ""Fake mahogany color, done poorly.With the bad reviews this product should be taken off Amazon."
1,Arrived broken.,The look of the Memorial Display Box was great. But it has a a 4 inches long slit on top of the Memorial display's wooden cover - just like the other reviewer. I have to return it for a refund and look for other box.
1,Be cautious buying it if you have acne,"I found this mask to cause a severe breakout. At first, I just bought it out of the whim from all the positive reviews people had given it, but that's not the case; instead I later found people posting on the ingredients, specifically on the ingredients being carcinogens and irritating. I was rather pissed because of this. I had a very formal event to attend and had the massive breakout to deal with. Thank god for concealers."
3,Not as good as any other store bought brand.,While I was waiting to get this product me (being impatient) went out and bought a knock off brand from a local store. I'd have to say so far the knock off brand worked better than this. I did not feel the face tightening effect other viewers had described with this product (though i did with the store bought brand) and this has caused me to break out in the most unpleasent of places on my face. Weird places like in between my eyes and eyebrows and forehead. Perhaps I will try again in the future but I am dissapointed in this product right now.
2,ok,it's okay i bought this off of a youtube review lets just say not everyone has the same skin type
5,I'm hooked!,"I recently bought this product for a couple bucks at Dollar General and what can i say?! This stuff is a miracle! I have oily skin and I have always struggled with acne and blackheads... or should i said USED to struggle! This product is a life changer. It not only shrunk my pores but it dried out my acne without over drying my whole face, also, my blackheads are starting to go away. Im glad to find a product that is so cheap, yet works wonders! I am for sure a life time consumer!"
5,Fountain of Youth,"Absolutely loved this! I've used the Mint Julep Mask from Queen Helene and thought that worked great, but the mud mask makes my face feel even smoother. I'm very dependent on wearing makeup, but this mud mask makes me feel confident enough to wear light to no makeup. I have some wrinkle lines between my eyes from squinting, and concentrating on my computer screen. I feel like with a few uses this has made the skin look firmer. The only down-side about it is that I don't care for scents, and this has a scent of rose petals. It gave me a bit of a headache the first time I wore it. Please note, however, that I am VERY sensitive to smells."
4,So-so,"I've used it for a few moths now and haven't actually noticed much difference, but my face does seem cleaner and tighter after I wash the mask off!"
3,very refreshing product,I bought this product at my local walmart and tried it right away. It felt soo good and was very easy to use. The smell was good too. I was however disappointed the next day when I had a huge pimple on my forehead. Its to early to say if its cus of this product or not but I'm going to keep using it an find out.
4,"Pretty nice, but...","...I'd recommend not using it if you're planning on getting close to someone you'd like to impress because, while it does make your skin feel silky smooth, it also smells faintly of sulphur. I suppose you could immediately wash your face with something more pleasant smelling and hope to hit every spot your mask touched, but I have a feeling even then you'd just end up smelling like an odd blend of sulphur and whatever-nice-smelling-stuff-you-used. It wears off after a few hours, but I just thought I'd give a heads-up. :)As far as application goes, it feels really nice on the skin... soothing and invigorating at the same time. It washes off easily as well. I haven't noticed anything miraculous, but I purchased it more for the feeling than anything else."
5,great clay mask,I've tried this product before so I knew that I liked it but I haven't been able to find it in stores for years! I was so happy to find it on amazon! It's a good product. It makes my skin very soft and it smells good. It even clears up my skin a little bit.
5,A Minty Miracle!,"For once--a beauty product that actually DOES what it SAYS it does. In just one application, it dried up my t-zone oil slick, shrunk my pores (which are big enough in which to carry loose change), evened out my skin tone, and softened my skin to baby's butt softness. It even seemed to tighten my fine lines. The minty scent is truly refreshing (AND relaxing). The clay texture is soft, smooth, and feels nice going on--very therapeutic. Oh!...and it lasts forEVER....oh!..and it's inexpensive. OH..my God..............I love this stuff.Bottom line: Stop spending ridiculous amounts on more expensive brands with fancy packaging and get something in a butt-ugly package that actually works. Period."
4,"Smells good, but rather dries out my skin","I live in Colorado, which is very dry, so I often have trouble finding beauty products that are up to the Colorado environment. this masque smells quite pleasant, with a lovely rose scent, and seemed to help clear up some small spots on my face. It dried out my face, though, so while it's not bad, it's not necessarily outstanding either."
4,Wonderful product! Great value!,This creamy and great smelling masque is light and refreshing. Your skin feels great afterwards and not dry or chalky like most that I've used. It hardens a little as it dries and tingles a bit when you put it on. I hope I never run out!
5,LOVE IT~~~,"It came on time, and works perfectly! I'm so glad because it's very hard to find in my city hence living in Canada. This stuff works wonders especially if you have oily skin. :)"
5,In love,This product is amazing. Simply incredible. I use this every night and wash it off after 15 minutes. I've had this for almost a week and I already see a remarkable difference. My skin has cleared up and my complexion is a lot better. I recommend this to anyone suffering with horrible acne!
4,"WOW, you can see a differance!","So as a guy, I never considered using any kind of facial stuff. Well I was convinced to ""try"" a mud masque. Let me tell you, in just one use, I could definately see an improvement. If you never used a masque before, its not that bad of a feeling. But when I was done I could see how my skin was more ""tight"" the effects lasted for about 1 week. I've done this masque 2 times since then and every time there is a dramatic imrpovement. I'd recomend this product over the Green one.Queen Helene Masque, Mint Julep - 8 oz"
3,"No miracles here, but still an OK masque","I bought this after reading a lot of favorable reviews (in fact it's one of the highest reviewed masques on amazon) so I was very excited to get this and try it. I have chronic blackheads that NEVER go away and some pretty large pores, everything I've ever tried hasn't been able to get rid of them, so I thought this would help with pore minimizing or clearing blackheads. I've been using this at least weekly, sometimes more, and there hasn't been any noticeable improvement in my blackheads or pores, even immediately after using it. It does smell nice and it sucks up quite a bit of oil from my face so it does have some benefits, but not enough to keep buying it. I'll have to keep searching for a solution for my face!"
3,too dry after using,My face becomes so dry after washing the mask away. So I think it is not for thin skin for sensitive skin.
5,Cool! (and minty),"I was a little skeptical when I read all of the great reviews for this product, but I decided to try it anyway. Lucky me! It did pretty much everything the product advertised, and it didn't over dry my combination/oily skin, even when I used it several nights in a row. Something that I thought was really exciting was that I could actually see all the oil that this masque sucked out of my pores! The only difficulty I had with this product was that it's really thick and a little bit hard to get out of the tube, but it didn't really bother me that much. Definitely recommended!"
4,Good lifting mask,"This mask tightens my skin better than any other I've tried(keep in mind though, that I'm still young.. so it may not do wonders for older skin). Queen Helene's Mint Julep mask is much better for acne, and clearing clogged pores, but still a great product."
5,great stuff,"love this stuff! Used it since I was a teenager on & off! It's cheap, smooth, and silky. as it dries you can see \where the oil from your skin darkens spots on the mask. it's cool. Skin ends up smooth, tight, and clean."
2,Dries out my skin,It feels refreshing when put on. But it really dries out my skin and makes me break out. Three times into using it and I feel it's more and more like a toothpaste. It doesn't help my pore either. Won't repurchase. Walgreen selles it for 3.7 and it's sometimes 1 dollar off. So more expensive to buy online.
5,The mask is great,"The mask is great. I bought this mask for the first time. I liked the reviews about the product. As a result, I am very happy with their purchase. The mask works wonderfully. I am struck at 15 minutes, a thin layer of the mask. The mask immediately dried on my face, and the longer I sat with it, the more it contracts face. The mask is not a strong smell, there is a faint smell of mint and the first time, it cools the face. The mask is easily washed off with warm water. The only mask is a little dry my skin. Next time I will apply it only to problem areas."
5,No moisturizer needed afterwards,I found this mask at a friends house and decided to try it because I had heard about it before. I'm not a big mask person but I am now. It worked so well to add moisture to my dry/combination skin. I didn't even need moisturizer on my face after I used it. Forget expensive masks from the department store. This is inexpensive and great!
3,Good Product,"I like how fresh and minty this mask feels, and it leaves my skin soft afterwards. However, I was not really amazed by the product, nor do I see any real changes in my skin, and I wish it left my skin feeling more moist."
5,Still a winner after many years,"For an inexpensive mask, this does the job for my face, especially when I have a small breakout. I've been using this for 14 years and hasn't let me down since. I use it a few times a week to keep the acne down with a minimum time of 20 minutes. However after removing it, tone (if needed) and moisturize (if necessary) I have recognize it can be somewhat drying, but it's not too bad, in my opinion. Still the best mask I use for breakouts."
3,OK,"Stung a little when applying to infected areas on the face. Used it everyday for a week, no significant effect on reducing acne or blackhead. So I stopped doing that and only use it once or twice a week. Easy to wash out."
5,"Smells a little funny, but who cares!","One of the big claims this mask has is that it relaxes facial lines and it's not lying! I'm 28, so it's not like I have wrinkles, but I do have a few lines here and there, especially between my eyebrows. It doesn't last for very long, but for at least a couple hours, I can say that those lines are gone and I look a little younger. It smells a little funky, kind of like old lady perfume, but if it works, who cares!"
3,"Works in some ways, doesn't in others","I have moderate to severe acne and I bought this in hopes of drying out pimples and closing them pores up. I read that people use this for spot treatment, but it hasn't worked well in that function. The only thing that dries up is the mask itself after application.For the other purpose of sucking up blackheads and closing pores, it works for a couple hours. Whether you apply it for 15 minutes like it says in the directions or if you keep it on overnight, the pores only stay clean for awhile. Pores are all part of genetics, and if you have big ones they are bound to gather up dirt and oils and stay humongous like mine. It does what it advertises which is why I gave it three stars. It just doesn't do it well enough."
3,Did not work for me,This product did not work too much for me. You got what you paid for. This will probably work best for people who have normal skin. I have a very sensitive skin and I did not see the difference before and after.You can't beat the price though.
1,Overhyped.,Didn't really do much to clear my skin. I have pretty clear skin but occasionally breakout; I tried this on a breakout and it didn't really have any effect at all. It feels and smells nice but that's pretty much all I can say.
1,Waste of money!!! Upset!!!,This product doesn't deserve one star!!! I bought this because it had many good reviews and everybody was saying that it worked but it doesn't its just like any another masque you can buy at Walmart or any other drug store. it was a waste of my money. I don't recommend this product to anybody. Keep your money!!!
2,6...How much?,"I have this product, if you guys know a place called FAMILY DOLLAR~ they have it for 1-3 dollars MAX closer to $2, $1 if its on sale. I used it cause the description said I could dry up my pimples...It hasn't worked for me. It has a nice clay like texture to it, but I personally didn't find it help for, or did I find it to do anything that it was supposed to do...it's more of a cleanse refresh mask for me than anything else. DEFINITELY not WORTH $6."
3,refreshing but don't buy all the hype,"For your buck this is definately a great spa product. It's a refreshing cool mask that does leave your skin feeling rejuvinated and soft. If you really love the whole ""spa"" experience then you'll be happy with what this product offers.However, do not really expect this to do anything for your skin if you have acne. It doesn't have any active ingredients in it that would really take care of that problem. This won't rid you of your pimples, blackheads or in any way shrink your pores. (Although it will claim to do just that)I gave it three stars mainly because I get annoyed with any product that promises something it can't possibly deliver (and doesn't even come close to doing). So have fun but don't expect a miracle."
2,Didn't like it.,"I really didn't like this product! The smell is very strong and my stomach was totally doin' back flips! It also made my skin very, very dry! I don't know... I just wasn't into this product!"
5,Not disappointed.,"Decided to try the product after multiple recommendations from beauty gurus on Youtube. If you have ever tried the Green Tea Extract Mask that comes free with the Proactive kit, it is similar to that, though I prefer the texture and smell of the Queen Helene Masque.It comes out extremely smooth, and dries a darker green than when you originally put it on. It works really well and my skin felt very taught after the first application. If you want to maintain the effect, just use it once a week....and the price on Amazon cannot be beat!"
4,Very good!,This item is very good!My skin feels very soft after using.I just wish it would have make my skin dryer :-)
3,worthy bargain,"smells and looks like toothpaste~ cool on face but a little dry, haven' t seen significant effect so far, but worthy at this price"
2,Didn't work for me,"I am a college student who suffers from painful acne on my cheeks and chin. This mask did nothing to improve or help the situation. I used it regularly and as directed. I am glad it worked for other people, but I noticed no improvement. It may shrink the appearance or pores, but I would not recommend it for those with acne."
5,Excellent mask for the price.,"For the price, you can't beat this mask!. Great smell, goes on smooth, and really helps minimize my pores for the next few days after I use it. Sometimes it leaves a bit of a sulfar smell on my face for the next day, but it's very minimal."
2,Disappointed. :(,"I was motivated by how much 5-star review this product got so I bought it at my local Wal-greens for 5.78 with tax included. I was desperate to reduce the size of my pores, sadly this product did not work for me. I even left it on for 30 minutes. All it did was dry out my skin. Very disappointed."
4,Lose a Tooth?,"I played this game with my granddaughter. It is good for children who are going to lose a tooth or who are losing teeth. It is strictly a game of chance but the bed to place the lost tooth and the retrieved coins are intriguing for children of that age.Phyllis Heaberlin, grandmother"
2,An abysmal mess,"I haven't read much in the genre of contemporary romance, but this book will not speed me toward becoming a fan of the genre. The plot is fairly complex and well-drawn, but the characters are purely schizophrenic, changing moods without reason or warning, swinging from cozily romantic to blazingly hostile and back, often in a single paragraph. And aren't the characters in these books allowed to have a single weakness? The male lead is a lawyer, a potter, a professional wrestler, looks after his 6 siblings and cancer-stricken mama and, oh yeah, we're constantly reminded, he's gorgeous and built. The female is a gallery owner, a country-western singer, a silent contributor to the local homeless shelter, and--yep--gorgeous and built. As to the narrative, if your idea of snappy repartee is lines like, ""You're a gifted genius!"" (this at the apex of a love scene, mind you) or ""He had a hot poker in his pants,"" well then, put down the Shelley and Shakespeare; Patricia Rice is your gal."
5,"The Fenians ""Hooley"" is Light and yet Tight...","This one is a GEM! I can't be blue when I listen to this music--even when the subject of the song is sad. Despite changing band members, they are tighter than ever. My favorites are Two Ten Train, Go, Move Shift, From Clare to here, Greener pastures, Hooley, and March of the King of Laois, the unmentioned 13th track. Actually, I love them all, but especially the Uilleann Pipes on Greener pastures and King of Laois...THANK YOU DR. HARKINS. Although everyone was grand on this one, lads, I have to say I will miss the ""GURU"" of the guitar, Mr. Rob Williams more than I can say. Despite that...the Fenians never disappoint, and I know the next one will be even better!"
1,They should surrender the name Fenians now.,"I picked up a copy of ""Every Day's a Hooley"" figuring a band with the guts to dub itself The Fenians would deliver the goods. Was I ever wrong.The music here is a suffocating pabulum that should raise the hackles of any true fan of Celtic music. The songs are wrapped around clichés and played so half-heartedly that a pulse check seems in order. The all-too-smooth and mellow vocals smother any power the band starts to display, and the songs invariably fail to rouse the listener's interest.Maybe this band is better live, but they should display some mettle and surrender the name Fenians now. They are not up to the task at hand."
3,"Mark Schulman is awesome, but the DVD... not so much!","This DVD tries to touch on many areas of drumming, and while it does cover many aspects of the recording process, it does not get into enough detail in any one area for this to be a great DVD. If you're inexperienced with tuning drums, there is a good section in here, but I would recommend Bob Gatzen's DVD, which is entirely focused on tuning drums. The best part about this DVD is seeing how Mark charts out a tune. Sure, there are a million different ways to do this, but mark's version is very concise, easy to follow, and takes very little time. If you have and extra 20 dollars, I'd still buy this DVD. THERE IS SOMETHING YOU WILL LEARN! Just don't expect to be able to make professional drum tracks in your studio after watching this DVD"
4,Jack Post Tete-A-Tete glider,"Great product for the price. Easy to assemble, though lots of parts, just follow directions and you'll be o.k. Like the sturdiness of wood slats and lightness of metal frame with strength. Thoroughly enjoying the cruising swing on my deck. Wouldn't have made any other choice."
1,Assembly NIGHTMARE,This may be a great piece of patio furniture but I doubt if I'll ever find out. It is a complete nightmare to assemble. ARRRGGGH.
2,Tete-a-tete Glider,The carton was badly damaged in shipment. We are in the process of putting it together now. The product didn't seem to be damaged.
2,Frustration,"We bought this item some weeks ago and are still trying it put it together. It has sixty-seven pieces not counting bolts and nuts. I have had two people trying to help me put it together in eight hours time and it is still a long way from completion. The problem is poor diagram-directions and holes not fully punched through for the bolts. Nevertheless, I have made it a life-project and will start again to construct it tomorrow and tomorrow, etc.."
4,"(Jeep SRT8) Perfect, but...","First I have to save the hitch fits and works perfect! Install was all of 4mins (its my hobby, so time depends on how quick you can find the wrenches lol). Everything included in box (make sure you look at the taped up package that has all the hardware!). The packaging of the hitch itself was kinda weak. They just sort of threw it in a box and taped it. I mean it is durable, since its a hitch and all, but would have been nice to prevent it from rolling around during transport. The only reason it got 4/5 was due to a personal preference. The receiver included is too tall/low (depending if you flip it) for my setup, so eventually I would get a better suited one. Other than that it takes my ""sports car jeep"" and gives me some functionality back."
5,So lovable!,"This was a gift for the youngest member of the family who loves ""Me-mo"". It was so cute we almost ordered another one for us!"
5,Super Sweet,"Kid loves it. Won't put it down. Seems to be made very well, solid stitching. Shouldn't have any issues with it. Thanks!!"
4,Cute toy,"I gave this toy to my grandson who is only 8 mos. old. It doesn't do anything, like make noise or move, so he prefers his interactive toys. It has a cute face and I liked it more than the baby did."
4,Fills in the background for Rawlings' classics,"This reminds me of old novels by Grace Livingston Hill or Gene Stratton Porter with the struggle against adverse conditions and conflicts over family values. At times it is heavy going. If this is close to what Rawlings' actual childhood and college years were like, I'm glad I read it before now turning to her classic, Cross Creek. I should get more from that reading with this book as background.Useful mostly to scholars, students and devoted readers of The Yearling and Cross Creek.I wish it had included photos of Rawlings as a child and in college and of her family. That would have been a plus."
5,Outstanding,"I purchased this book for my son and I when he was about 5. It was one of the most breathtaking and warming, yet sad stories I have ever read in a children's book. The illustration is also beautiful. About 3 years ago, I gave it away as a wedding present and recently bought two more copies as a gift to 2 little girls, and for our library."
3,Reggeton Calle ocho,"Its alright, but I bought this cd thinking it was all reggeton and its mostly mixes and no known artists. Not the cd you want to buy if you want reggeton. I have better cd's from local dj's than this one."
1,fonzy,I kind of didn't like it because it was not interting to me and I don't recitment it to kids onel to babys. It is good book but at the same time it is not good.
4,Miss Smith's Incredible Storybook! By Yusen,"Miss Smith's Incredible Storybook is a wonderful book full of fantasy.When the class was an about to start Zack thought that this year will be as boring as last year. Until Miss Smith enter to the room and said ""Good morning class."" Zack thought that that it was way more different from the other teachers(it had spiky hair.)When ever she tells a story all the characters come alive. One day Miss Smith couln't go to school and the principal needed to read!!! What do you think the principal would say? What would happen?I recomend this book to kids 4-9. Parents will enjoy reading it to their children also."
3,Other Artists than Spann,"This CD should not be listed for just Otis Spann. Spann has only one track, although he also plays on a track with Robert Lockwood, Jr. There are 16 different artists, so this is really a sampler. For Otis Spann fans, try something else!"
4,A Glimpse Into Tink and Peter Pan's Relationship,"While I found much of the plot frustrating (why doesn't Tink just tell everyone she lost her hammer? What's the big deal? ...), I found the scene between Tinker Bell and Peter Pan fascinating. Since their relationship is part of such a much bigger mythology, I found it surprising/odd that we would see Peter Pan in one of these chapter books (as opposed to, say, in the hardcover books by Gail Carson Levine), but I thought the author captured Peter Pan well, and my 6 year-old daughter was delighted by the humor in the scene between these two iconic characters. For me, that scene was ""worth the price of admission,"" and, as usual, the illustrations are gorgeous as well ..."
5,We LOVE this series!!!,"We own all of this series! Started reading them when my daughter was 4 (she just turned 5 now), and they are age appropriate. Not too scary and always a happy ending. One book only takes us about 4-5 nights worth of reading together. The longer ones are good too ""Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg"" and ""Fairy Haven and the Quest for the Wand"", but they are a little bit scarrier than the short books (more appropriate for ages 5-7 I would think)."
5,Hope.,I have Hope in reading her story for my own IC. I reference it often to help heal my own body. She gives an account of her life from trying to be diagnosed with IC and how she healed herself afterward. This book gives you hope if you have or no someone with IC diagnosis.
2,Healing Path,The book has some tips but gets wordy repeating the same things over and over. It was just ok for me. Nothing really new to me. I think this was written before natural herbs came out for IC.
3,Good Suggestions for a little known condition,The book gives hope to persons afflicted with IC for which there is no known cure.
2,Not Much Help....,"This book is composed of mostly ""opinions,"" and very few medical ""facts."" The author is very honest and upfront about this. What disturbs me most about it, is that the opinions seem a bit on the ""paranoid"" side. I gave it two stars because it did contain a limited number of useful facts.....not very much new info, though."
2,Direct Action,Not bad. Took two evenings to finish.Kind of a run-of-the-mill CIA thriller. Some of the characters/scenerios were highly implausible
2,From Back Cover,"Nurse Rita Barone noticed everything about moody cardiologist Dr. Matthew Grayson - his broad shoulders, his powerful hands, his eyes that saw right through her scrubs, his lips set in a scowl that seduced her into giving up her innocence. But she never noticed that he was the secret admirer who'd been sending her anonymous gifts. The pragmatic Dr. Grayson felt a fool. A renowned surgeon with a crush on one of his young nurses? No matter how much he dreamed of touching her, kissing her, undressing her, Matthew knew that for the ""Beast of Boston General,"" bedding a beauty like Rita was nothing but an elusive fantasy...or was it?4th in the Dynasties: The Barones series"
3,"Great music, problem with CD-R version","5 stars for the music, but most tracks were mistakenly truncated before the end on my CD-R version (I returned it). Nothing against CD-R in principle, especially if it brings music that might otherwise be lost, but the used market might be better for this one until they get the bugs ironed out."
3,"Worked ok, but now the rest of the story.","I used this installation kit on my Accent 2002 with a new Clarion cd/radio. Everything went in alright, except for one glitch. You couldn't take off the removable radio dash front like you were suppose to."
1,Useless Trash,"The Nasal aspirator is trash- the rear cap opens as soon as you squeeze it, so there is noo suction. The Aspirator is also too hard to press. just bad design. The thermometer is sometimes correct, so you wont know when it is correct unless you have second/better one. The only thing useful is the measurement and spoon combination (its design could be better, because the spoon is a little too deep, so about 0.2ml is wasted.) The nail clipper is politically correct, so you cant sue it to be too sharp, and it wont clip nails easily either."
1,Cheap,I saw all the bad reviews and yet STILL bought it because there were not many other options that were affordable. The only thing in there I use is the nail clippers and even those are cheap. Shame on me for not heeding the reviews. I advise against this kit. Only issue is I don't know what to recommend instead! Still searching for myself!
2,Scented with Talcum powder scent,"I haven't had a chance to use any of the items yet, however they are scented, which very off puting. In my mind something that is to be used for medical purposes should not be scented at all."
2,"OK as a gift, not very useful in real life",the product looks good but when I used it it did not satisfy my expectation. The nail clip was very dull. The quality of the white squeezer was really hard to squeeze --- a lot harder than the free ones we can get from hospitals.
2,dissapointment,"I just find out that the thermometer is not accurate! It is showing a much lower temperature then the actual one!! It is quite upsetting when your baby has a cold and you need to check weather you should go to a hospital with her or not!!The nail trimmer also disconnect from it's plastic holder, and won't cut the soft nails of a newborn."
1,Useless. Poor quality.,Our daughter is now 13 months old and the only item we use in this kit is the nail clippers. The thermometer is unreliable and the rest of the plastic pieces are so poorly made they're useless. I wish that I had just bought nail clippers separately.
1,Junk!,"Cheap quality, broken items, not worth every penny!Our baby were vomit and choke herself, when I tried the suction to sucks all the mucus, it's broke and there's no way you can use it without keeping the bottom part attached.Extremely dangerous!"
2,not reliable as mentioned,"I like this product before i come to utilize the ""comfort tip medicine spoon with cap"". it melt after i put in Avent steam sterilizer for 2 times !!!! what a piece of junk !!!The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Baby Healthcare and Grooming Kit"
5,Hidden gem,"Start to finish, this album is solid. The first three songs give it a great start and the whole album gets better on each listen. Someone play a few of these tunes on the radio!"
5,don't knock it!!,"hey, this was actually a pretty funny show. it has good jokes that made me lol, literally! thaqt doesn't happen too often, so, this series has my vote. yea, yea, her boobs were a bit too much, but i did get some ideas for some pretty cute outfits! :)don't ask, just buy it!"
5,A series too funny to have been cancelled!!,"This sitcom is so cute, funny and enjoyable. Why do the networks cancel these very watchable shows and put junk on TV?? The comic timing and story lines on this series are chock full of laughs. Pamela Anderson is very talented at using her best qualities and humor to make this show work to the nth degree.. Unfortunate it was cancelled."
4,Love the show!,So sad this show didn't get renewed. Great ensemble cast featuring Christopher Lloyd. Pamela Anderson is refreshingly funny as well!
2,"Pammy is great, but the show...","The show is formed by good actors and Pamela is stunning in it, bringing FUN and LIGHT to the stories.However, it is not funny enough. It tries really hard to be, but, overall, it's all about weak and - only sometimes - witty jokes."
2,She should have been a Librarian,"This series would have survived longer if her character was a librarian and worked in a public library. Bookstores are boring. Libraries are full of all the sitcom situations that you can possible imagine, plus 1,000 more."
3,"Nice, with a side of disappointment.","I've used this product 3 times in the last two weeks. While it doesn't do anything bad, I haven't seen much good from it either. I bought because I have oily skin with large pores, which is very blackhead prone. I thought the peel-off mask would have more of a ""pull"" when I removed it, but it didn't. I'm going to keep trying though, using different thicknesses to see if it changes anything."
3,Peels off nothing.,"Its a peel off mask, I thought its suppose to peel off at least some gunk in my pore. Zip, Nada, none. And the smell is super strong if you put some on the bridge of your nose. But the good side is it leaves your skin smooth. I guess it does some good."
4,Helps my acne!,While doing some research on pore minimizing I came across this product. I have oily skin for the most part and prone to breakouts. After peeling off I notice it really helps my acne as well as pore size and my breakouts don't last as long. This is definitely part of my new regimen.
2,"Too thick to apply properly, not great at deep cleaning pores","I'm not sure if I got a tube that was old, but it was so thick I had to squeeze the tube very hard to get the masque out. Then the application was thick and uneven. The thickness would have been ok if it worked better but it didn't clean the pores in my skin as well as other peel off masques have in the past. I wouldn't buy this brand again. If you are looking for a gentle masque this is ok for moisturizing, but if you really want a strong peel off masque this probably isn't the product for you."
3,it was just okey!,Not great...just okey..I didnt feel like it did a very good job of working my face muscles while peeling off!
5,Makes your pores look amazing!,I have been using this product for a while and I love the way my skin feels after using it. It isn't smelly and only takes about ten minutes.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I originally was looking for a thicker type of peel off masque, but when I got it, it's a very clear, thin, material, and has a chemical smell. It goes on slick and takes time to dry, then peels off like (you know when you were a kid and you put the elmer's white glue on your hand and it dried and you peeled it off like a layer of dead skin). YES, like that. Didnt do much for my skin's overall quality either. I am in my early 20's, fair skin, and combination type also if that helps. I recommend the Queen Helene's mint julepe which is great. Not so much this product."
1,Don't buy this product,1) Product is difficult to apply to face. 2) It never formed a mask; just stayed as goop. 3) Took an inordinantly long time to remove. It was very unpleasant to use.
5,Excellent service! Product is just as described!,I loved it! I appreciated the speed that my product got to me. I will be doing business with you again!
3,Initial Reaction,"I LOVE Queen Helene products. They work really well for me.I remember when I was younger trying an apricot peel off masque my older sister use to use i think my saint ives? Anywho I decided to try this grape seed one.I have only used it 2 times, not counting the small initial tester.The masque is quite thick and sticky and the smell is horrible.But i applied it to my clean face and waited about 7 minutes and some areas were dry and other not at all. So I had to peel it off section by section. I think I may be missing something when it comes to putting this on my face.The second time I did the same thing but waited about 11-12 minutes. This time it started burning!!! It wasn't a burning sensation I couldn't handle, so I waited for it to complete drying and then peeled it off. My skin felt like it was oil-moisturized afterward. Since I've only used it 2 times I can't speak for the results but this is my initial reaction."
2,I don't like this!,"I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn't remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite. This product is messy to apply and thick, and it takes a long time to dry and I don't see a difference in my face when I take it off. I left it in the draw with all the other products I don't really use because they do nothing special. I mean really!!!"
4,Good product to let you have a good rest,It is a good item. But you have to close you eyes for a few minutes if you don't want to cry.
1,misleading,"The Queen Helene website touts their products as being ""inspired by nature's finest ingredients, because they are safer and often more effective, than harsh chemicals and unnecessary additives"", that they use ""good-for-you ingredients."" The Grape Seed Masque contains dyes. I was very disappointed when I received the product and read the label. I'm hoping their other products are healthier than this one. I won't buy unless I can read the label first."
2,Ultimate Flea Trap.,"The discs included with the trap are incredibly difficult to use. They are made to be set in place, but they constantly curl up. After the trap arrived in the mail, I brought all three of our dogs [German Shepherd, Australian Shepherd, and Pomeranian] into the house and put them in their kennels. Despite the trap being placed right outside of the kennel doors, it has only ever caught one flea. I gave this product two stars instead of one because it caught at least one and there is always the possibility that there was only one flea between the three dogs."
1,Not worth it,"This item does not work. When I first received it, I was so excited. After setting it all up, I was hopeful that this would be the end to the flea problem we have. As i went to plug it in, I noticed nothing was happening. So I went and check on the unit and guess what the light bulb was burned out, making the unit useless. I haven't even used it and I can't use it.I contacted Amazon and told them what happened. They shipped me a new one. Willing to give the product a second chance, I went and put the unit together. This time, I noticed a huge crack in the piece that you use to tighten the bulb to the structure. Well now the light bulb won't stay on and keep falling onto the sticky pad.I eventually just asked for a refund. In the whole 5 days in trying to get this unit to work, 0 fleas have been caught."
3,"Catches insects, not sure about fleas specifically","Haven't seen a flea on it, but it keeps the other flying insects in the house kind of at bay."
1,Flea Un-Trap,"I bought 3 of these in hopes of attracting at least ONE flea that my dogs have been passing around. Placed these NEAR the dog beds, in other areas where they hang out and 3 months later am STILL waiting to catch my first flea. Worst product ever."
4,Very surprised,I have to say this product really works. I will buy more to help protect the house. Well worth the price..
1,Garbage...,"These 'traps' were absolutely awful. They're an eyesore and inconvenient to have in anyones home. On top of their horrible appearance, they failed to catch a single flea. These are floor lamps outfitted with super sticky paper. Thats it. And the product even failed in that simple design. The paper comes curled up and maintains that shape when you attempt to lay it flat on the bottom of the trap as instructed. In the end these traps went in the trash and I ended up using an alternative from a pet store which did the job."
2,Flea trap not worth my money/,"Well, I either don't have any fleas in the house, which is great, or this simple little thing doesn't work. My main concern with it, however, is worrying that the cats will be curious and end up getting a paw stuck on the sticky pad. It's like fly paper. I'm having a deck built and so I guess I will try it outdoors; but, I think I really just wasted my money on a gimmic."
3,Not THE answer but it does help.,"Once your home gets infested with fleas it takes a multi step process to get rid of them. I don't know how pet or kid friendly it is. As long as the kids or pets don't touch it then I guess it is kid/pet safe. It is basicly a glue trap with a light. I didn't want to treat everything with toxic flea powder so I bought this. I also treated the pet with frontline and started vacuuming everyday. The flea trap along with the other steps helped to get rid of the problem. Don't expect to set it up one night, go to bed and wake up the next day with the entire glue disc is covered with fleas. The first night is caught only 6 fleas and a spider. After a week in the same spot it had 50-60 fleas on it. So it does work but it takes time."
1,Just didn't work...,We bought 2 and placed near our dog beds. We caught 1 flea in 2 weeks and our dogs still had fleas. The flea traps haven't made a bit of difference in our constant flea battle.
2,Caught everything but the fleas,"I bought 5 of these because we had a flea problem with the cat, and I did not want to use chemicals.A few days later, one trap had 1 flea, and another had 2. All 5 had in fact caught a bunch of other bugs, so thanks for that.Needless to say we still had flea bites on our ankles, but no fleas in the traps.That was it for us. After a week, these wastes of money ended up in the closet. I had high hopes, but alas, it gave poor results."
1,"Fleas right next to it, but it didn't catch them","This didn't work at all for us. We seem to have hundreds in the carpet, and I wanted to try the non-toxic solutions. But it didn't catch any fleas. I can see the fleas hanging out all around it, but they are not attracted to it at all. They do stick to it, when I catch them by hand and put them in...so it is sticky enough. It just doesn't attract them in any way. I think it may catch some fleas if the infestation is bad enough that they hop into it by chance. I would think our infestation is bad enough, as I caught 30 by hand one night! But the trap caught zero."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought two of these units, one for each carpeted area where my dogs hang out. A month later and I have yet to catch one flea. Lots of other flying critters,leaves etc but not one flea and my place was infested at that time.I have hanged onto both units and the refills as I will be having a party and these may work well hanging like a lamp on the patio and mebbe I'll trap a mosquito or two. (not kidding)"
3,"Got 2, light went out on 1 after a week","They work as advertised, but these traps alone will not cure your flea problem. Also, I would give it a higher review, except that one of the two I purchased only lasted a week before the bulb went out."
1,electrical problem?,"I really wanted this to work. I had tried the nightlite + a dish of water method and while it worked for a while, the water always got spilled or dried out.I plugged Flea Trap in, found it gave out a nice non-disturbing light, I thought, yeah, I can live with this in my bedroom. Within 2 hours, the bulb was burned out. Replaced the bulb with a new one, within an hour, that bulb burnt out. Tried with a third bulb, same result. Each time, the bulb burnt out dramatically, with a black cast on the glass. I'm not going to try again.Oh, and also, while it was set up near my pet's area (with a burned out bulb), his tail hair managed to get stuck on the adhesive. Scared him."
4,Good Product,I am amazed at how many fleas this trap catches! I placed it within 3 feet of my large dog's bed with great results. My only complaint was that the small light bulb burned out after a couple of weeks. I just replaced it with a night light type of bulb.
2,a great gnat trap,"My dog & I were both being attacked by fleas. It wasn't a bad infestation, judging by the fact that I only saw a couple, but it was very annoying. Both of us were very itchy.I bought 2 of these traps; put one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Left them on 24 hrs a day for a week. They caught about 30 gnats and 1 flea.I wanted to believe that maybe there just weren't any fleas, but my dog was obviously being bitten and was non-stop itching. So, I finally broke down and used frontline (I hate to use pesticides on her) and the problem was solved.Even with my bedroom door shut all day, with just the trap inside it still only caught 1 flea. Not really worth the $20."
2,Don't waste your money,"I liked the idea of a non-chemical solution to my flea infestation, and since many of the reviews here were positive, I thought I would give this a try. Well, I have used it in the most nfested areas for several weeks now, and have caught 1 flea, probably by sheer accident. I even set it overnight directly on the couch where the dogs like to lay, and nothing. I was disappointed that this had no effect on my flea problem."
2,Not sure!,Either this product does not actually attract fleas as advertised or I have no fleas in my house which is unlikely. I have used the trap continously for more than two weeks and not one flea has appeared in it. I have two dogs and one cat and though they are treated for fleas they often come in from outside with them.
1,Useless,This is a waste of time and money. All I caught was dust and some gnats. Flea spray works better.
2,Caught something with wings.,I bought two of these as well as two of the refill packs. I've had them running for 24 hours and the only thing I have caught is a gnat or something with wings. I added these to my arsenal after discovering fleas a couple of months ago. I first tried Frontline on my two cats...no good. I then moved to the carpet/upholstery spray...not much good. I then added Program for my cats and used Capstar to kill the adult fleas. Capstar works great but doesn't last. I then moved to a carpet/floor powder. I still had fleas so ordered these Victor Traps. I vacuumed and washed everything every single day for the past two months. Either the fleas are finally gone or these things don't work.Update: 02/23/13. Still have fleas and have two of these traps which have not caught 1 single flea since I've had them out.
1,"junk, make it yourself",This little device is the same as leaving a night light on and putting some tape on the floor. thats it. Yes bugs attact to light that is the truth but this did nothing for us.
3,Didn't work so well,"My apartment still have fleas and the light has already been broken, so whole kit will be waste,I want find more effective way."
2,Fleas were more attracted to us than these traps,"I was excited when I first set up my flea trap, as I had one flea immediately come out and inspect it. Unfortunately, he never jumped in. In fact, of the 100 fleas that ended up in the trap, 99 of them were ones I caught and put in there. For that purpose it was helpful, as even rinsing them down the drain wasn't a guarantee that the fleas would stay down (Some would climb back out!). At least they'd stay stuck to the sticky paper.I finally gave up this time and had Terminex come in and spray the carpet. That took care of the fleas. There was no odor within a short time. I wish I had done it from the start.I forgot to mention that one of the bulbs that came with my order didn't even work."
1,do not buy this,"I purchased two of these products, one for myself and one for a friend, after reading reviews. I had a bad flea infestation in my small house and all this trap caught was a spider. My friend had the same experience. Washing my dogs everyday gets rid of fleas more effectively and is more cost efficient."
4,Works as advertised,"The Victor Ultimate Flea Trap (M230) does, indeed, work. It's a simple and effective concept. Our cat lives outdoors (he adopted us) and there is fairly high traffic of feral cats, deer, squirrels and chipmunks, so we mainly have problems with fleas in the yard and garage. When we come into the house we'll always have a few 'passengers' come in with us. I've been using the Victor trap near the garage door and it usually gets a handful of fleas overnight. We have noticed a decrease in flea bites on ourselves, leading us to believe that the trap is a good supplementary defense. I do not, and would not, rely solely on the trap. I spray the garage, distribute granules on the yard and driveway, and use Advantage spot treatment for the cat.I have also found that a disposable plastic plate with a mix of a few drops of dish detergent in water, placed underneath a nightlight, is equally as effective as the Victor flea trap."
5,satisfied,"An earlier review of this product almost made me pass on the purchase, but I'm glad I didn't. I bought 2 and within the first ten hours 40-50 fleas were caught. Moving the traps periodically to new locations appears to be helpful. I plan to get additional traps for other problem areas."
5,It is the Ultimate!!,Victor Ultimate Flea Trap I bought 2 of them and within 48 hours one was full of dead and captured fleas!! I would highly recommend this item to anyone!
2,CHEAPLY MADE; BAD BULB,Victor M230 Ultimate Flea TrapI DON'T HAVE A FLEA INFESTATION. THE PRODUCT WORKS AS IT DID CATCH TWO FLEAS THE FIRST TWO DAYS. HOWEVER THE BULB BLEW OUT ON THE THIRD DAY; I GOT A NEW ONE. NOW IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE OF SOME PROBLEM IN CONNECTION. TOO BAD. IT IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO MAKE A WIRE TO A BULB THAT WORKS MORE THAN A DAY OR TWO
1,Failure to launch...,"Item did not work - we returned it. We live in N. Florida in a rural area. We have 7 well cared for cats that spent the mild winter in a small utility room of the garage. Floors are concrete and walls are metal. No heat or air. Fleas got especially bad in the spring in this little 14' x 15' room so we tried this. Left it on 1 week straight. Mostly caught a few spiders, some other flying insects and 1 or 2 fleas - most likely by accident! When you walk into the room - you instantly get 20 fleas on your feet - so obviously this did not work!!!"
3,Desk lamp and pie plate of soapy water works just as well,After 3 days I have caught 6 fleas. Animals are on frontline and I still see fleas on my pets. So is it that this really really works and I just don't have alot of fleas or is it that it just doesn't work as claimed? I am flea combing everyday and still finding 1 to 3 fleas per pet..so the fleas are coming from so where. I bought 2 of these and as previously mentioned only caught 6 fleas. I took an old desk lamp and set it up over a pie plate filled with soapy water and it is working just as well and was cheaper. My next step is to try diatomaceous earth. I so wanted this to be part of the cure..but alas it wasn't so.
2,"Cheaply made, marginally effective","Although easy to set-up, the trap was flimsy and cheaply made. Additionally, the adhesive pad did not lay flat on the bottom surface. I could forgive its faults if it functioned adequately, but after two weeks it has only captured a couple of fleas."
1,Gimmick that works moderately better than a glue trap,"The first night, I set up the Flea Trap in the main problem area and set up several Real-Kill 5"" glue boards, flat on the floor, in other areas. The cheap $1 apiece glue boards caught more fleas than the flea trap. That's pretty sad. After 48 hours, the trap caught maybe 30 fleas where I would say the glue boards caught 50+ each. Victor is charging $15 for a $2 light, a $1 plastic dome, and two $1-2 glue boards. Even an optimistic estimate means they're charging at least twice what this is worth. If this product had cost half the price, I would probably have given it a 3* rating."
2,"Wanted it to work, but caught no fleas whatsoever","Once I discovered fleas on my 7 year old dog, I immediately ordered this trap. I was excited to receive it, and its simple construction and setup were a breeze. The trap paper was incredibly sticky and tacky, but warped in such a way that it wouldn't lay flat on the bottom of the trap.I set up the trap next to my dog's bed area and the first few times I left the house, the trap's light was the only one left on. After several days, not a single flea was caught. The trap paper was still very sticky to the touch, and inspecting my dog revealed that he still had them!I bought monthly flea treatment instead, and noticed results within hours of application. My advice is to opt for a little extra expense for a more reliable solution."
2,Worked for 2 days till the bulb burnt out.,"MUST BE PLUGGED INTO ELECTRICAL OUTLET...simple cheap materials, with light bulb-that burnt out within 2 days and this was with me only plugging it in at night...Not worth what I paid for it...If not for such poor-quality components, it would be fine.Did catch around 20 fleas the time it was on...Now I can't use it WTH unless I go to the store and find a nother lightbulb myself, WHICH i will HOPE fits it."
1,Doesn't Work,"Save your money and buy Frontline, I tried this in many different rooms in my house at night, and nothing, no fleas on the sticky pad, but still in my couch and bed."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I ordered two of these, after being in use for over a week, the only thing that they've caught is a mosquito each. save your money and don't buy this. (if I could give this a 0 star review I would"
1,Great Night Light,"Well...so far, all it is doing is collecting dust. But it makes a great night light. I will be moving it to different location for testing and will update this post as results (or lack of) develop."
4,Good but...,"I have this flea trap and a different one. They both do what they're supposed to do except this one loses a star. The reason why is because the design is not pet-proof: my cat got too close to it and ended up getting stuck to him. I had to cut the sticky cat fur off of him. Other than that, it works well enough."
5,Ultimate Flea Trap,This is the best flea product I could have purchased. It was amazing how quickly and great it worked. It was a really bad flea season and I don't think without this product I wouldn't have stood a chance against them!!!
2,Ha!,"If you want to trap fleas this is not the device to buy! I am guessing a bowl of soapy water with a flashlight over it would work better than this, dont waste your money!"
3,flea trap,"I have a dog and a cat that were having some flea issues so I purchased this since I had tried everything under the sun to be rid of them. I really can't say how I liked it. You plug it in and the light is on which is fine.. and I'm not sure if I'm happy that I didn't see any fleas on it or not! However, I did get a couple fruit flies!"
4,it works,It does what it says. Just ordered another one to put in another room. Word recommend but have more than one for bigger houses
1,Seems like more of a gimmick than anything else,"I bought two of these because my dog picked up fleas when staying with some friends. While we have used numerous methods for our dogs, I wanted something that would help catch any fleas that were around in the house. I put one by the dogs bed downstairs and one by his crate and...nothing. After 2 weeks there was nothing on the traps but dust, despite the fact there were still fleas a foot away in his bedding.This is a normal light bulb that shines on a sticky pad. That's all. I was hoping for more based on the positive reviews, but I would recommend spending your money and efforts trying something else. Maybe the lightbulb and sticky pad will work for you, but it didn't for me."
1,Plastic piece of garbage.,"The trap is terrible, it doesn't work. I followed the instructions and left it plugged in but after three days the light stopped working, the bulb was fine, the actual electrical part was the thing that was broken. After about a full week of leaving it out, I had one flea. ONE FLEA.I decided to remove the dome because I thought maybe the fleas were jumping on top rather than in it. When I did I caught four more. I wouldn't suggest doing this if you have a kitten because they're small enough to get their whole body stuck on one of the discs.Unless your house is some disgusting hovel with fleas covering every surface you're probably not going to capture that many and you're wasting your money if you buy this."
2,Not effective,"The light attracted maybe 6 fleas, still plenty around the trap did not catch. I would not recommend to anyone."
4,The Flea Trap Seems to be Working,It's more than a night-light as it proved last night once we set it up. Took less than 15 minutes before a flea jumped in. This morning we checked the trap again and we counted 16 fleas! I didn't think I had a flea problem in the living room but this trap is proving me wrong. I'm on-line this afternoon ordering two more! Give it a try.
3,"Works, but keep away from pets!","This product seemed to work well. Within a couple hours of plugging it in I saw fleas stuck to the paper. However if you use this, make sure you put it in a place where your cats/dogs can't get to it. Our kittens were fascinated by the flea trap, and they got their paws stuck to the paper several times. Finally, after only a couple days, one of the kittens got stuck to the paper so badly that he pulled the paper out of the trap, broke the lightbulb, and when we finally got the paper off of him, lost a lot of fur. So just make sure your animals can't get to the trap. ...However, this is very inconvenient since the trap works best when placed on or near the floor."
1,Does not work...,I had this thing on for a week and was not able to catch even one flea. I resorted to flea bomb... which worked wonderfully.DO NOT BUY THIS. Useless.
5,Hassle Free!,"I know many people use a lamp and water with soap, this is much easier. This has been a wonderful addition to our home. It is easy to use and it really works. There is no hassle with dealing with water. But, if you do not wish to order the refill on the sticky pads, you can use water with soap in the little pan. If you have a problem with fleas this is a definite must."
1,Waste of Money,"Yes it did attract a few but doesn't have ANY impact on my home flea problem. Please don't be influenced by that fun review that usually is the first review here. As title says, it is a waste of money."
2,ultimate waste of time,"Very disappointed. Placed the product next to flea ridden pet bedding. Three days later, the only thing it caught was a moth and an ant."
1,"WASTE OF MONEY, DON'T BOTHER","We were having a abnormally high flea problem, even with the use of my usual monthly flea meds. We treated our dog, the yard and purchased this to work along with carpet/upholstery treatments.It never caught one flea! not one! The fleas were there, we saw them. But this trap is useless."
1,CHEAP! and BREAKS EASILY!,"Bought this product to attempt to get ahead of fleas in my house. I set it up, you need to set it up where the dog/cat is most often so it could be in the middle of your family room! --- had it for 1 week-the only thing it picked up was dog hair and lint---then the dog was running into the room and hit it and it was done--the entire thing EXPLODED! the bulb burts and the cheap plastic that keeps it ripped--NOT BROKE--RIPPED!DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK!"
1,Works better than I thought,Used this trap for one week and did not catch one flea. I know my dog has fleas because I can see them. This product is another example of claims that are not true. Since writing this review I gave the trap to my daughter. See used it for a week and caught 15 feas. I guess my dog had fewer fleas than I thought or I did not have it placed correctly. I felt obligated to correct my review to be fair to the manufacture. I can now recommend this product.
1,Garbage,"Lets see, I caught a total of 1............ MOTH !! Yet I still keep getting bit 5 times day by fleas. I guess I can keep it to catch moths. Are fleas even attracted to light??? Maybe my fleas are just handicapped and cant jump over the lip of the trap. Dont know."
5,Works,"Purchased the Victor and Springstar flea traps at the same time. They both catch fleas but the Victor caught a whole lot more. Probably about triple the amount the Springstar did. Just a word of advice for getting rid of fleas though. This trap alone will not solve your problem, but using this trap in conjuction with constant vacuuming should make a BIG difference. Atleast it did for me. I actually now own 5 of these traps and have them placed in strategic locations around my house. You may also want to buy some flea spray as the light on the trap attracts fleas that gather around the trap as well."
2,FLEAS!,It didn't work very well. We left it out for over a week and there were only 4 fleas in the trap. My husband was still getting bit. We used a non toxic flea carpet powder and that worked much better.
1,Faulty equipment,I bought this for a flea problem i had but i got it and it was not hard to put together but the bulb blew out the next day i put it on and it would turn off during the night not sure if that is what it is supposed to do but I was not happy with it. Hope it worked for everyone else who got it. All i did was get Hot Raid bombs from walmart and flea powder and took my cat to get a flea bath and the fleas are all gone.
2,Save your money,Have had this 3 weeks and caught 1 flea. Sorry I bought it. Use shallow dish with dish detergent. Works much better
4,Thinking about using water instead of sticky pad.,"This item seams to catch some fleas, not all of them though. Since I have no pets right now, I am thinking about filling the tray with water when I run out of sticky pads. The replacement pads cost way too much for what they are. I am hoping that the fleas will fall in the water and drown because they can not swim at all."
1,sticky night light : /,bought based on favorable reviews...$30 lesson learned: not all reviews are truthful &/or some people have SERIOUS flea issues! all we caught in 4 weeks was 2 spiders and my dog (she was playing near it and stepped on it)! ugh...
2,waiting,Have had this up and running for 3 days with no results yet seen. Will be moving it to a new location soon. Its use is bounded by the length of the cord powering the light.
3,Flea Trap Revies,"the animal has fleas we know, but the trap has not had one flea on it since we purchased it."
2,Don't waste your money,"The bulb that's included blew out within two days of use. But, even prior to that - I saw not results"
4,useful but not a solution,"I like the reviewer who described this as part of an ""arsenal"" of weapons. Our dogs are on Ivermec year-round, front lined year round, wear flea collars, get flea baths, get powdered with diatomaceous earth, and flea combed frequently but still have fleas. They live outside, but we still got fleas in the house and can't get rid of them. We tried bombing it twice with no noticeable impact. I try to vacuum everyday. We have tried sprays for both the animals and the surfaces. This sticky trap does catch quite a few fleas and other insects so it works, but so far it hasn't eliminated the problem. I would give it 5 stars instead of 4 except the light bulb that came with it burst the minute we first plugged the brand new unit in, and we found they don't sell the recommended 7watt nightlight bulb everywhere. Many stores only have them in 4watt which we tried but doesn't generate enough warmth to be attractive. I say give it a try but don't expect this one weapon to win the war."
4,Victor Ultimate Flea Trap,"I live in the country where we have a big problem with gnats, fruit flies and grass fleas. I was quite happy with this product. I put it on the floor and turned it on at night. The next morning there were 4 fleas and several gnats stuck to the sticky paper. I left it on from that point 24/7. The fleas were attracted to the heat from the lightbulb and got stuck to the paper, no problems. It is not unattractive and can be set up in a corner or out of the way place, but has to be near an outlet. I wish the cord was longer though. Also, the nightlight sized bulb burned out after just one week. Other than that, I will be ordering several more of these to put in other rooms. Unless you have a big flea outbreak, I think the sticky paper that goes in the light should last for quite awhile till its all filled up."
2,Did not really work,"This item did not really work for me. I put it near the dogs beds (where they sleep most of the time) and in about 3 days caught about 2 fleas in total.Also the lightbulb went out after one night (I left it on overnight).Overall, I would not recommend this product as it is also an eyesore and did not really work.I'd suggest getting some shampoo for your dogs and getting a flea comb and some house/dog spray and doing that method, albeit more laborious, much more effective."
3,Didn't work for me,"I was encouraged by the reviews and maybe expected to see more after setting this thing up near where my cats sleep for the night, but it didn't catch anything except some lint. i even moved it to where the cats sleep during the daytime (near my kids beds) expecting to ""lure"" the fleas off and more proximity exposure - nope, didn't work either. maybe this is for cats with more fleas, not just a few per cat, but didn't do what i expected."
3,Flea Trap,"For the price, I guess this isn't a bad product. Although it has trapped some fleas, It does not attract the fleas very well."
4,works only at night in a cool room,Got this product in the afternoon and used it in the bedroom as soon as i got it. Only snatched one flea. Put in in the living room over night(only light on in the room) picked up well over 30 fleas(didnt count just estimated).PROS:works and is cheapCons: doesnt work in a cool room when the sun is shinning in.
1,Did not work for me,"I used this product for 2 weeks and did not catch a single flea. I know I have a flea infestation because I've caught about 20 myself, and have over 50 flea bites. It did, however, catch a couple of other insects so I give it 1 star."
1,Flea Trap Holder,"It does attract the fleas, but the glue on the pad that is supposed to hold them does not work. Once they get on the pad, they are still able to move around and excape."
2,Bulb burnt out in 1 day,"The trap appeared to be working pretty well, until the bulb burnt out on the first day. Not worth the money."
2,Caught every other bug but no fleas,"I know we have fleas, I have seen them jump ship when I bathe the dogs and cats, but this product. which I left in the most infested area, did not work. It caught earwigs, lady bugs, even a bunch of ants, so it is a great ant catcher, but that is not what I bought this for. I have had better luck with flea powders and flea bathing products for my animals."
1,Ultimate waste of money,"I had an infest of fleas in my master bedroom and I tried the dawn soap mixed with water,lysol,salt and flea powder on the carpet, none of those worked so I bought this ultimate flea trap and it was plugged in for a little under a week. It did not catch a single thing. My co-worker suggested that I wear white long socks in the dark and turn off the light for about 15-20 seconds and the fleas would be attracted to my feet. She was right they hopped right onto my socks and that is how I caught 29 of them."
3,uncertain of how well it really works,"I bought two of these traps based on the mostly positive reviews of the Victor Ultimat Flea Trap. After a week of use my two traps caught a total of one flea. In fairness to the product I should note that we had already been vacuuming every day for 3-4 weeks. We had also treated our apartment with boric acid and our cats with Frontline. Thus, the Victor Trap may have literally caught our last flea! I think these traps would have been very useful in the early stages of eradicating our flea problem. I'd recommend getting one of these traps and using it in conjunction with intensive vacuuming of carpets, thorough washing and cleaning of things or place where your animals may have sat or slept, treatment with boric acid, and perhaps most importantly using something like Frontline on your cat or dog."
1,Didn't work for me!,"I really don't know what I was thinking when I purchased this product. Perhaps desperation? The photos from other customers seemed to suggest that this product actually worked but, after two weeks of usage, I never caught a single flea. (I placed this trap near my dog's bed.)"
3,Maybe too early to tell,"My dog got fleas for a second time in 2 months so I bathed him, treated him, washed all things he is near and used powder for the carpets - I was still paranoid about the fleas so I bought this product to further ease my mind that they were gone. I was very optimistic since all the positive reviews but I have been rotating this product throughout the house for the last couple of days - Only caught 1 flea and a few other misc bugs. . Not sure if its because I do not have a large flea issue or its not working.. I plan on continuing to use it until I am 100% certain."
2,flea trap,it did not catch anything.And it is so bright that at night you have to turn it off and its bright.
1,Does not work.,"We tried this when our dog got fleas and the first thing I noticed was that this is bad craftmanship, the products feels and looks incredibly cheap. We had it out for several days and did not catch a single flea, this product was a complete waste of money."
2,Didn't Work,"First off, the product arrived with a busted bulb. So I ran to the hardware store and got the same wattage bulb. I haven't caught any fleas at all. We have had to deal with the fleas through other methods. This product did not work for us."
2,buy a flea comb instead,"So I read the reviews for this product and thought I'd give it a try. My putty tat got fleas from my fiance's outdoor felines. I put the traps out and treated the cat with frontline. The trap caught one flea and 3 fruit flies!!! After a week, I purchased a flea comb and combed out a bunch of fleas on her. I recommend the comb over the traps..."
2,not really worth it,"its basiclly a lint roller sticky tape with a night light bulb. dont bother, just spray if you are having a problem and vacuume and clean well, don't waste money on this."
2,Really just for houses with LOTS of fleas,"It says inside the package that if you don't have a ridiculous number of fleas (and yes, I am paraphrasing here), then you may not catch any with this - they aren't kidding. Getting the sticky pad insert into the flea trap itself was a nightmare and the sticky pads were all warped and curved because they had been stored, rolled up, inside the trap during transit. I am not sure if that was something the seller did or something that the manufacturer did. Now, did this thing catch bugs? Yes! I had two little gnats stuck in there in about a week. But fleas? No. I have three dogs, all had fleas pretty seriously off and on during the summer, and the trap had nary a flea in there. If you have lots of animals with lots of fleas and a place to put this where it will be within a ten foot radius of them though, should be great."
2,Buy something else,2 problems1. The sticky pad was warped right out of the box making it useless. Fixed this problem by attaching double sided tape to the backside so it would lie flat2. The bulb burned out within a week.Buy something else
1,Use the money as kindling for the fireplace instead,One of the worst investments I have ever made. Did not catch a single flea--but there is a bright side--it makes a great night light.
1,Dont work at all,I read a lots reviews talking this is good but in 5 days i dont get any flea on this and isee them in a carpet and them not jump for a flea trap. dont spend you money and your time on THIS
1,Not for curious cats.,I have a cat who is into everything. This product lasted 2 days before my cat stuck his foot into the trap and got his paw stuck on the adhesive pad. He was not hurt but the trap was completely destroyed.
2,Not sticky enough,"The problem with this product, at least for me, was the sticky pad. Either the one I got was old or the pads are just not sticky enough. I actually watched a flea jump onto the trap, then jump right off. I'm going to spray the pad with Super77 spray mount, an aerosol adhesive and see if that works. If not, well, I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Because it didnt work properly like the instructions says,"Follwed all the instructions I saw only 2 fleas in 2 days, after the 5th day saw a few more, would not invest on it again."
2,soap and water are cheaper,Not only is soap on a dish and a flash light cheaper but the quality will be better and after your fleas are gone wash the dish and repurpose the flashlight.I gave tis 2 stars instead of 1 because technically it did the job just not as effective as above method.
1,My advice is not to buy this device,This device might have some beneficial application for someone somewhere but not so much for me. It is a very cheap plastic bowl with a small night light bulb that screws into the top. Adhesive paper is placed inside. Fleas are attracted to the light and the warmth. The fleas hop into the bowl and get stuck on the sticky paper.I caught between 30 and 50 fleas before the bulb burned out in my unit. The same amount of money could have been better spent on some permethrin based insecticide.This is more of a gimmick or a toy. I knew that ahead of time but I like gadgets so I bought one. I am disappointed that the manufacturer didn't at least use a higher quality bulb in the flea trap.My advice is not to buy this device. Your money will be better spent on some quality insecticide.
2,no,"this product didnt work it collected more dust then it did fleas or bugs ....very disapointed was really excited to purchase something that its not chemical possion to my dog i hate giving him his monthly advantage he gets itchy and dry skin from it i have try other kind and it still the same he dont have fleas but dont like putting that stuff on him,,,,cause if something that can harm me i definately dont wasnt to put it on him."
2,Doesn't seem to work,"After reading so many positive reviews I decided to buy three units and a bunch of refill pads and I really wish I would have tried just one. Apparently they work for some people, but I haven't caught a single thing.I have three cats in a one bedroom apartment in San Diego (the flea capital of the world). I have fleas. Even with Advantage I am combing them out of my cats daily. I know they are here. But not one of them has ended up in the trap. Given that I have three units in a rather small space, I'm sort of baffled that not one flea has even accidentally ended up in the trap.In addition to not catching any fleas, I'm not sure it's terribly pet friendly. I sure hope the glue is pet-safe since it's ended up on a few tails and paws.Apparently it works for some people. My recommendation is, at the very least, don't buy three units and a bunch of replacement pads upfront. Just try one."
2,Nothing,Sat there and caught nothing. The only fleas found on it were the ones we caught and put on it.
1,Waste of Money,"It's a light bulb and a piece of sticky paper - hasn't caught a single flea, bug, or other pest."
1,It did not work!,"I put the flea trap in 2 different places where my cats hang out, 2 days each. Not one flea. And the light is so bright that I can't sleep at night without turning it off. The glue sticks to my finger all right but not one flea on it. Meanwhile my daughter is getting more bug bites...Victor M230 Ultimate Flea Trap"
2,Have not seen a flea on it and it's been two days,"I'm not sure if this product works or not, I only saw 2 fleas in the past month or so, but I bought this because I wanted to catch the fleas that were not on my pets. In October I noticed a handful of fleas on 4 out of 6 of my cats, so I bought Frontline plus. On the 30 day mark I noticed 2 fleas, on two different cats. Since one of my cats had a horrible reaction to Frontline plus I had to go to the vet to get Revolution for them. So I am not sure if the revolution has killed all of the fleas, which could be the reason that I have not seen a single flea on this thing? I live in a tiny apartment, so I have this set up in my living room, where the cats hang out most of the time but so far I haven't seen a single flea..."
1,Don't bother,"Not worth the money, time or effort.From the time I set this up Friday evening to the time the bulb burned out Sunday afternoon, there were 8 fleas caught by the trap. I caught and killed many more in several minutes just by standing about a foot away from the trap and using Scotch tape to catch the buggers."
3,worked well for 2 days,"This was wonderful for the first two days, then the lightbulb died. I know I can get a replacement bulb, but I was hoping for more than 48 hours of activity before having to go shopping again. In the first two days, however, it was very effective, with fleas happily throwing themselves into the volcano of sticky death."
3,Not sure if it worked,I didn't see a big improvement with it....I ended up having an exterminator come and that nipped it in the bud right away.....
1,Did not work for us,"We live in a two family house in the second floor and I have just discovered my neighbor has fleas. I think we bring those upstairs when we come and go. I bought 2 of these traps, one to my living room and the other one to her emergency exit which opens to my stairway. Used 2 nights and caught nothing. I keep trying though."
4,It works for me!,I just received this yesterday. I set one up in my bedroom area where 4 cats sleep and play. It was amazing and shocking at the number of fleas it attracted. I experimented w/ the second one and used it in an aluminum foil pie pan filled w/ 1-2 inch depth of soapy water. It also caught some fleas and 2 moths. I think the refills are a bit overpriced but will keep on hand for one and continue to use soapy water for the second one. So simple but effective. I no longer wanted to continue using Advantage since 2 cats are getting elderly and one of my kittens had a reaction. So today I started using Little City Dogs CHICKEN FLAVORED Flea Killer Capsules for Cats - 12 Mg Nitenpyram Per Capsule and their equivalent Program capsules. Hopefully my household will be flea-free in a few days.
5,This WORKS!,"This seriously works! I have an indoor cat who never goes outside. I still managed to get fleas somehow in my home. Fleas are the worst thing ever I swear. This was my first experience with them so I did everything I could in my power to get rid of them. Besides vacuuming literally twice a day every day, I gave my cat a bath like 1-2 times a week with Dawn dish soap. I used various sprays and powders for my carpet. I even had the bug spray guy come bomb my home. Fleas everywhere still. So I found this product online. Within a few hours of it being on the trap was covered in fleas. This really helps get rid of the adult fleas. Plus no chemicals! I swear to this product, you wont be dissapointed."
5,Amazing product,"I wasn't sure if this would work but thought I would give it a try. I plugged the two of them in and within 5 days, the traps had caught over 100 fleas. The animals seem to be flea free and we are as happy as can be. Great product. Thank you"
4,Biting back,"Received order fast! Can't say I'm not satisfied. It is trapping the pest every day. Guess have a load of em to get rid of. Still receiving bites but seems like every time we move the traps to new locations, we get more. Only catches them at night when it's the only light available. I guess they go after the heat of the bulb. Been nearly two weeks and still catching 'em! I think the range is about 10 feet, not 30."
4,flea trap,"We had been inundated with fleas this year, had set off flea bombs twice, dog got shampood weekly, used sprays on furniture etc the fleas seemed to hide somewhere. The minute I plugged in the flea traps I was no longer a target for the fleas, have had them plugged in for a month and caught hundreds of fleas with only one change of the disc. Price was extremely reasonable, only wish I could have gotten them sooner."
2,Not very effective.,I used this item in conjunction with a spray treatment for the carpet / furniture as well as treating the cat's and it did not seem to work very well. The glue pads were also very painful to place inside the trap and I had to throw away 2 because they were stuck to each other out of the package. The product itself is very poorly and cheaply made and is not sturdy; if you happen to drop something on this or step on it accidentally it is game over.
4,Helping in the fight against fleas,"I was extremely skeptical of this product but got it anyway. It is helping in our fight against fleas but obviously not a cure all. We turn it on at night and the little buggers hop right towards it. I'm not going to agree with posts that make you almost expect a flea conga line into the light, but you can actually see what you caught the next morning. I also like that it's chemical free since I'm 6 months pregnant."
1,didn't catch a single one,"Perhaps we just didn't have the requisite infestation for this item to work. I tried this after my indoor cat got fleas this summer. I also treated her with Frontline, vacuumed every other day and did a Borax / salt treatment on all the rugs, so maybe my multi-pronged attack had just wiped out most of the population already."
1,Worst rating in ease of use: getting the sticky pad into the trap is a mess,"First of all it says in the product description that there are two sticky pads. There is only one. They flat out lied, and because of their lie, I don't get another chance in fitting in their horribly designed sticky pad into the trap. When I removed the sticky pad and its cover it was impossible to get it flat into the trap floor.If you look at the materials used in the trap, it is really simplistic and cheap. It is basically a plastic top and bottom and a tiny light bulb. The sticky pad is the main crucial ingredient to its success which is pitiful because of its difficulty in securing to the bottom of the trap. Unless the company offers to send me a set of replacement sticky pads I have to say this product is inferior to the competitor's flea trap product."
1,1 just 1,"Dog has fleas and I wanted to not resort to anything (besides give my dog flea baths) that could harm my 3y/o (bombs and other chemicals) thought this would work after reading reviews on it. The people who loved it must have had a real problem because in one week of use there has been 1 caught. Not only that the pads come rolled up and wont lay flat in the tray. if you try to adjust them they stick to your fingers, so I put some tape on the bottom to try to hold it down. Ill keep at it but so far not so good..."
1,Disappointed,"Hope springs eternal! Logically, I know that these will not do much; yet, I purchased two. Yes, they have collected a scattering of fleas in two weeks, but I could have collected far more with my vacuum cleaner. I consider this purchase a waste of money. In cases where they seem to work, there must be severe infestation with no warm animals to latch onto. (Yes, I do use Frontline every 3 weeks.)"
2,It almost works,I bought it because it was going cheap.The sticky parts that I received for the trap are not that sticky. Otherwise it seems to almost work fine.
1,Flea Trap,"After 5 days of continuous use right next to the dog's bed, nary a flea was stuck on the trap and my dog was still miserable."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!,I kept it on for about a week and nothing.I actually saw fleas in the house but there was nothing in the trap after about a week!I don't understand why there are so many reviews...I don't get it...maybe these positive reviews are fake ones posted by manufacturer??? really.....it doesn't do any good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Worked great while it lasted,"I received my order of three traps about Oct 2, 2012. They caught a lot of fleas and other bugs. This is Nov 7 and two have already stopped working. The first one that died only lasted about a week. I changed the bulb so I know it didn't just burn out."
3,It works with some help.,"+ Product works- Light lock nut arrived crossthreaded (requiring tools to correct)- Thin plastic- Light burnt out in first weekIf you are mechanicaly inclined build one yourself. All you need is a light, tupperware bowl, and carpet tape."
1,Light bulb stopped working the second night,"I got this trap two days ago. It worked fine the first night, got about 6-7 fleas and a small roach, but the light bulb got burned after the second night. Never used it daytime, only at night."
1,"Not effective, easily broke","I bought 2 of the traps because they were made by Victor, when we were having fleas problems on our animals. We treated the animals and set up the traps. The traps did an OK job the 1st night but then 1 of the traps the light stopped working the 2nd day. I was very disappointed."
1,Didn't Work,"We had a flea infestation at home and no fleas were found in trap after numerous nights of leaving it on. Also, the light is very bright so if you are going to leave it on at night, keep in mind that the light is bright and yo may lose some sleep!!! Fleas are attracted to heat, not the light directly, so if you have something the emits heat such as a human and/or animal, the fleas will likely jump on it. I would return it but I just don't want to go through the hassle of having to mail out the package."
3,It works good,"It came on time It worked for like an hour trapped 2 fleas then the light bulb died !So I went to Lowe's to get light bulbs ,I found some it is working good so far it came with extra sticky pad."
4,good,I'm pleased with this product. It does what it says it does! It has helped my flea problem.I would buy again!
1,Very sticky mess,"I am not happy with the device, the sticky pads are hard to open and do not lay flat but curl and any attempt to fix it gets your fingers stuck.And the small finger tab just makes it harder to set inside the tray.Poor design."
3,flea trap,Product works well just cheaply made and the refills cost more in shipping than they cost. Light bulb just sits not attached.
3,okay product,The product works okay but it's a little flimsy. You're better off putting some water in a shallow pan and add a little dish soap then place it on the floor with a low wattage lamp on top. It's like magic the bugs are attracted to it and they fall in and die. It's a lot cheaper and it works a lot better.
1,Don't bother,"It's a nightlight and tape. I used two of them in my small apartment on 24/7 and caught nothing. The dogs however needed flea baths, over and over. A complete waste of money."
3,Didn't work for me...,"The idea of this product seems to make sense, but it didn't work for me at all. I ordered it with refills and moved it around a few different places where I knew fleas would have been hiding, but nothing happened. I don't want to knock it down completely and I would rate it a 2.5 if I could. I think it's a smart contraption and if you have a big flea problem, it might work. I think it didn't work well for me, because I didn't have as big of a flea problem as I thought. Mine was a flea and bed bug problem combined. I didn't know about the bed bugs until recently and I can definitely tell the difference between a flea bite and a bed bug bite. Also, my cats had flea dirt and the vet confirmed they had fleas. Again, I just think my flea problem was minimal. So...this product didn't work for me at all, but it might work for someone else with a bigger flea problem."
5,Fleas Release Me Let Me Go...,I really didn't think this would work but I was pleasantly surprised that it does! Of course it isn't flea season here yet too cold but the strays that were around found the trap and are no more.
1,What a piece of junk,"Title of review about says it all. I wanted an eco-friendly flea control to use in one room while I clean in the other. This trap is sleazy, hard to put together, and ineffective. The other advertized flea-trap is a much better buy."
3,Not the best quality materials,"After ordering this product I did a thorough ""de-fleaing"" of my home, but when it arrived I set it up anyway. I never caught any fleas, but did catch some gnats and a small spider. My chief complaint about the product is that it is a bit flimsy in construction, but it does appear to be reasonably well designed to catch fleas. Overpriced for what you get."
5,Great item,"I just received the 3 traps I ordered. I set them up last night and within minutes, there were fleas stuck to all 3 traps. We'd already been diligently vacuuming and spraying to try and rid ourselves of these nasty pests but adding these traps to the battle has made me feel better about winning the war. I give these a ringing endorsement."
5,I ordered more flea traps...,"I got 2of these flea trap from last year.and This year there are alot more fleas are coming back and 2 flea traps are not good enough for my house with 5 rooms,so I ordered 3more for rest of the room.I set this one of the flea trap in my bedroom 2nights ago. and I see 30fleas in the trap so far. I bet alot more fleas will jump in it day by day..I love this flea trap!! I can wait to get the ones that I ordered last night.."
4,seems ok,I am not sure how bad my flea problem is but I have notices a couple fleas on the pad since I put it down
3,"Only has 2 glue discs, not 3 as description says",I haven't tried this yet. I bought two. I'll probably return one though. The text description says it comes with 3 glue discs but it actually only has 2. :( I literally picked this one because the price was good AND it said it came with 3 glue discs. Bummer.
3,Flea Trap captures two fleas,In Two weeks it has trapped two fleas. I used other flea control products on Cat and house at same time so there may not have been a lot of fleas left to trap.
2,Not very effective,"This product takes up a lot of floor space, is not attractive and works mediocre. Wouldn't waste my money again"
2,useless,Only caught a stink bug. Tried it in 2 different room near where the cats slept and nothing. Ended up bombing.
2,Who knows...,No way to know if it works well or not. The bulb died after ~48 hours. 2-3 fleas were on the sticky pad. Tired of companies pushing cheap Chinese crap on us. I know its just a bulb.. but I paid for the dang thing.
3,Doesn't not work,"Not really a fault of the product, but this won't really help if you have a flea problem. I caught tens of dozens of fleas with this, but when they number in the thousands, it's ineffective. Vectra (non-poisonous, unlike Frontline/Advantage) is what you really need."
5,"Traps cockroaches, too!","The bulb burnt out a few weeks in, most likely because I handled it roughly and have faulty outlets. However!! This magic light with sticky paper not inu kept my kitty happy while I was at work, because it was a warm, sunny glow, but it seemed to suck the fleas right out of my carpet and her fur! The bulbs are easy to replace, the sticky pads are cheap and work WONDERFULLY! I bought refills right away, because members of my family have ones in there houses :D"
1,Infested room...one single flea,"I followed the directions to a ""T"". In the most infested room, I caught one single flea. End Of Comment."
2,Victor Flea Trap,Didn't really lure in that many fleas. I used it as a night light for a while. Don't waste your money.
2,Did NOTHING.,"I know I have fleas in my carpet and cat beds. I bought 3 of these things and put them where the fleas are. ZERO. ZILCH. NADA. Left them out for several days and nights. Idiot that I am, I tossed the boxes and can't return them. I also bought some Diatomaceous Earth which MAY be helping."
2,Flea Trap,"Piece of junk. Very flimsy and didn't seem to work. After about two weeks it had trapped one flea. Maybe I didn't have more, but for the money expected a little better quality and results."
1,Not worth the money,"I have had this trap for over a week now, and it has not caught one flea. Waste of money."
2,DON'T WASTE $$,"NEVER SAW 1 FLEA IN TRAP,JUST CAUGHT A FEW STINK BUGS .DID NOT SEEM TO WORK MUCH .HAS TO STAY ON 24/7"
2,Doesn't Work Well,Only caught on flea due to the warmth of one small bulb. Then the bulb burned out. It's in the trash.
2,"Other bugs, but not fleas","Placed next to where the dog naps, the item was in the vicinity of fleas. The trap however, did not catch a single one. A couple different kinds of bugs, a lady bug and a beetle, but no fleas."
1,"Non Toxic, but does not work","We have a little flea infestation at my home, but we have children here often and we were looking for a non toxic alternative. This product seemed good enough, we put it together and set it up. It can act as a nice night light, but thats it. After 2 weeks of leaving it in various parts of our house where we had been bitten no fleas. I left it on my couch, because I knew there were fleas there, as I had been devoured by them an hour earlier. Left it there for a week and it caught nothing. I repeat NOTHING. I took off my couch cover and went over to a bathtub of water and shook it out, about 15 fleas fell into the water. So what this tells me is that this contraption can catch fleas that ""accidentally"" wander on to the paper, but it will NOT attract fleas. I was skeptical about how this ""trap"" was supposed to attract fleas in the first place. Now I know the answer is it doesn't."
1,Broke right away,I have no idea how well this works at trapping fleas because the bulb stopped working in less than 24 hours.
3,good night light,"My 2 cats & dog came down with a case of fleas.I figured it wouldn't hurt to try this out since it had many great reviews. I also sprayed the house with flea killer so maybe the spray just worked really well because not a single flea was on the trap.It did,however catch other flying bugs so it wasn't a waste of money.All in all,I really don't know if I would recommend this product.Although if you're sitting outside some evening and you have a place to plug it in,I'm sure it would be great!"
3,Still undecided,"We purchased this after our pug had an outbreak of fleas and thought that it would help with our problem after reading some of the reviews on here. After using it for a couple nights placing it where we thought fleas would be hiding and it only managed to catch 2 fleas. We followed the directions, placing it in unoccupied rooms with no lighting and it produced very little results. Now at the same time we were treating our dog with Frontline + and Novartis Capstar Flea Treatment as well as giving her baths to rid us and her of these vermin. This could have impeded the ability of this trap to work if all/most of the fleas were on our dog and died to the treatments and baths."
1,Complete waste of money,"I am shocked that a company with the well known name has such a misleading product. No fleas were ""trapped""; they would have wanted to get stuck on this trap. I am totally disgusted with the waste of money on this product."
1,Caught my dog instead!,"The only animal that this contraption caught was my poor miniature schnauzer! He managed to get his paw stuck in it, and we had to cut his fur to detach him from it! It didn't catch a single flea and that didn't surprise me. It was very cheaply made."
2,The blatant errors in this book are shocking!,"I am probably one of M & P's greatest fans and even I was shocked at how many typo's, complete paragraph errors, etc., that this book has. Hopefully in the second printing, (if there is going to be one) the mistakes will have been edited out. If they are, I am sure that the first edition printings will be a collector's item."
2,Did they even have an editor?,"I am used to finding typos in published books, but this one takes the cake. it's so horribly edited that it's laughable, and it makes one question the fact-checking."
1,worse than you can imagine,"The ""sloppy and disappointing"" reviewer has it right on. If anything, the book is worse than that review indicates. The tapes were either transcribed by a particularly backward sixth-grader or someone who simply didn't care. There are mistakes on virtually every page, there is no index and narrative flow is replaced with a patchwork of jumbled memories. This is truly a crass, opportunistic rip-off."
4,Great but...,"I really must say that I do really like this keyboard and think that it is great but, the shiny black strip at the top collects dust and fingerprints and smudges like no other. It drives me insane. If you are moderately OCD or a clean freak please keep this in mind."
5,"Soft, smooth, comfortable","Very easy to install (plug and play), just install the cd for customize the functions keys. Just keep in mind something the keyboard will be on all the time the pc is on... Amazing response. Buy it!"
1,Overpriced and Under-Lit: Avoid!,"I bought this as a gift for someone that uses one of those ""old fashioned"" keyboard trays. You know, from the days when a computer was a rarely used accessory in your home office. (it tucked away so nicely when you weren't using it.)Since the keyboard sits in the shade essentially under the desk, I thought a backlit keyboard would be worth the money. This one is definitely not worth the money. Maybe $20, nothing more.The blue backlight is very very dim. It will be useless for the reason I bought it. Since the letters on the keys are backlit too, they have to be translucent. That makes the letters less bright than had they been identified with white paint. That means they won't even reflect ambient light in a dim room. The programmable keys are very hard to figure out, too.If you're looking for a backlit keyboard to use in dim rooms, keep looking. This is a dud."
3,Red River D,"Eearly recordings as expected, but adds to ones collection, however, if you are a yodelling fan you may be surprised as I was, "" YODELLING Red River Dave"" does NOT yodel much......This is the third recording (LP/disc) that I have purchased of R/River Dave. In his era he was a nice singer with some good songs, BUT he should not be adverised as a Yodeller......he only yodels on a limited (small) number of songs...Sorry !"
4,its pretty awesome,"I got this as a Christmas present for my dad. My dad LOVES IT...It came right when it said it was going to. The grill cover is very durable. The grill cover in the picture and what I got varys in color a little bit. My dads grill cover is a little bit lighter blue and the one in the photo looks black/ dark blue...but it was fine with him. It also fits bigger grills, so it was the perfect christmas present!"
3,Looks nice but.......,"First of all the picture on this product shows that it's blue but it's not blue, it's black. So don't buy it thinking you're getting blue because you're not. But that was OK with me. My bigger problem is the construction. The velcro strips on each end intended to hold it tight around the grill and prevent it from blowing off aren't attached on good at all. The velcro attaches together fine like any velcro but the strips won't stay attached to the cover. I'm constantly trying to think of new ways to try to reattach them."
1,"50"" DLP nightmare","We bought the 50"" version of this tv in January and it worked for less than 60 days. Four months later we are still battling with Philips to repair, replace or give us a refund. It has been the worst experience having spent so much money for a TV and now being at the mercy of the manufacturer and the repair shops to do something with our set. I would not recommend this TV or any other TV from Philips because they are really awful to deal with and completely unsympathetic to our request for a refund so we can purchase a TV that works! Four months and counting..."
2,BEWARE,"Beware, this TV is expensive and won't last. Picture went out and only audio worked. The warranty is that so as soon as the warrant runs out, the TV will burn out!!! Philips won't help so don't bother. Get a lifetime warranty or you're SOL!!!"
1,Not worth the money,"I was given this camera as a gift for Christmas 2004. 2 weeks later, I had to send it into HP and have it replaced because it wouldn't turn on.I'm on camera number two. I have taken over 3,000 photos since I got the camera, and that was all within the first 2 months. It was great until then, and then it stopped working. I never had a problem with the batteries until April of 2005. Ever since then, the camera will turn on, take 3 pictures, and then I have to charge the batteries.Sometimes my camera decides to turn itself off suddenly with no warning. Othertimes, the LCD will turn bright pink, and it will shut down. No explaination. No warning.The folks at HP have been of zero help. I got this camera free and it's not worth it."
1,Useless and no support from HP,"As has been stated many times in other reviews, this camera simply DOES NOT WORK with batteries. You can put brand new AA batteries in it, and it will maybe take one or two photos. Often, it will only turn on for a few seconds and then abruptly cut off. I have emailed HP repeatedly with this information in addition to providing links to numerous message boards where many have stated the same problem. Their solution was to send me a long email with an update file for the camera. After going through the whole process, I realized my camera already had the suggested update on it. Bottom line is that this camera is garbage and a total waste of money. HP should have offered refunds or coupons off of future purchases in order to rectify this situation. As a result, I will never by another HP product again."
2,Battery-hog. Shuts off for no apparent reason.,"I bought this several years ago at Wal-Mart for about $130.00. It was cheap - then. In its price range, it was the ""best"" one with a video capture function (although the videos are very grainy). I used it extensively in Paris for a trip to museums, and such. Overall, I was pleased with the pictures ...for a 3.2MP camera, and the 3x optical zoom.But it eats batteries --any kind I threw at it, even after updating the firmware to v1.07.Also, it developed a habit of shutting off at I was reviewing/scrolling though pictures on the view-finder. It now shuts off while navigating, and I need to remove the batteries to reset it. VERY frustrating. If it weren't for that - and its appetite for energy - I'd be fine with it.As of now, I can't trust it to function as my camera."
1,"Power, forget it....","This is my second HP camera. The first one I purchased was a hp Photosmart 620. The 620 was great. I am extremely dissapointed with the M305. If you use the flash, be prepared to change the batteries out after just a few pictures. If you use rechargeables (even the 2500 amh), you will need to have the charger nearby and be prepared to take the two AAs out every minute or so. Even when using alkalines, the camera drains the power to quickly. I have also lost pictures in the camera due to losing power and having problems with the camera writing to memory.Stick to a camera that uses 4 AAs instead of two. Pass on the M305, I wish I had.The camera also crashes when you try to take subsequent photos. Forget it."
2,Defective- a total lemon,"when this little camera works, it works well. The pictures are acceptable quality, and it's a handy size to tote around anywhere.Unfortunately, HP totally missed the quality-control boat on this one. My first one had a defective shutter. The replacement eats batteries, I don't get even an hour's use on lithium batteries.The bundled software isn't much to write home about either- it's not well-organized, and takes too many steps to do simple tasks like sort and delete batches of photos, and select photos for editing."
2,Less than stellar picture quality.,"Bought this camera for a beginner camera for my fiance. She used it for about a year until we replaced it with a Sony DSC-W7(No comparison at all). While the camera was fairly easy to use and has a good design, the picture was generally poor with a grey tint to most photos. The flash was inadequite as well. Previous to this, she used an HP 635 2MP camera that didnt have the grey tint to it, could not take a clear picture to save its life. I have pretty much since given up on HP cameras mainly due to poor picture quality. Not too mention the ridiculous battery life."
1,Garbage,"I wish I had read the reviews on this before purchasing. While I did get a great price (around $50 new - it was a day after Thanksgiving sale) - it's not worth much more than the $50.Like the other reviewers mentioned, the picture quality isn't great - and I usually have to really tweak the white balance & EV compenstation in order to get a decent picture. But usually by the time I get those figured out, the brand new batteries I put in will only have enough juice to take about 10 more photos.This is definitely the last camera I'll purchase from HP."
4,FOR A FLAWLESS FINISH,"Ever look with envy at the flawless complexions featured on magazine covers? Their skin resembles fine porcelain. Oh, come on, we think, everyone has pores! I got pores, you got pores, all God's chillun got pores!But, why aren't theirs showing when ours may look plus-size? Maybe these silk skinned lovelies share a secret - Joey New York Pore Tightener and Filler Serum. This is a gel that is oil-free and serves as a primer, creating a pristine canvas first for moisturizer and then makeup.After cleansing in the morning simply apply a thin layer of Serum all over your face (avoiding eye area), and let dry - only takes a minute or two. Next comes moisturizer followed by makeup if you wish. Now, go and have your picture taken.- Gail Cooke"
1,I sold mine on eBay for .99 in the middle of winter,"I sold mine on eBay for .99 in the middle of winter - I guess I was the only one stupid enough to miss the design flow of this grate.When the fire is burning, all the coals run down to the bottom of the grate, so there's no way for the outer pieces to remain lit.WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP. lol. I lost $139 finding out the hard way."
1,Not for Fibromyalgia,"For those who may be tempted to use this for Fibro pain,do not use this product.The menthol in it will only cause an increase in your Fibromyalgia symptoms.Most Fibromyalgics have a salicylate and/or phenol sensitivity component. Please research the protocols to lessen your ingestion and/or use of these substances, and you will not need this product!Also, never use this type of product if you suspect you have the Flu."
4,"Good stuff, helpful for muscle aches","Believe it or not, this stuff does really help mild-moderate stiffness and aches. I've had neck issues for years after a mountain bike accident and car accident and this stuff is good for helping relieve stiffness in my neck that I get before/after sleeping. It has minimal odor, which is good if you want to use it during the day at work."
4,Arthritis helper,"Action does not heat as I thought it would. I have real hope for this product, but no real results yet."
1,Change the locks,"change the locks is quite a dull book, with little to no surprises, dull characters and an unimaginative storyline. the theme is the highlight of the book portraying the life of a boy hard done by, at the end of the book, it turns out stevens mum was a squatter who was questioned for one afternoon and fined, this is the climax of the entire book. simon french than tries to keep the ""excitement"" going with another cheesy twist just to finish with. so overall this book should be avoided."
1,awful,"terrible quality, and the box was beat to pieces when it arrived. one slat was broken in half, that looked like it was broken in production, not in shipping.awful all the way around."
4,Crazy about Beauford!,"Central Virginia loves Beauford Sloan, and NOT just because he lives here. The pudgy protagonist is a wee bit on the edgy side this time around, and you will be on the edge of your proverbial seat. Raymond Austin has given us another fine thriller in ""Your Turn to Die."""
5,NEW BEAUFORD SLOAN.....YOUR TURN TO DIE,"Like the first two. This is a touch better, great read. And sadly it could happen."
2,ONLY TEN?,"You could investigate any religon and find Ten good men. Of all the gays priests that have been exposed there are probably thousands more that have not been. Do you really believe the rest will confess?Tje Catholic church has always bee corrupt. From the casteration of the boys in the vatican boys choir to keep there voices high to the murder of John Paul the first. Read, ""In the name of God"""
4,real men......,"""Be not afraid""""Witnesses to Hope.""""Do not abandon yourselves to despair. We are the Easter people and hallelujah is our song.""""The future starts today, not tomorrow.""""The vow of celibacy is a matter of keeping one's word to Christ and the Church. a duty and a proof of the priest's inner maturity; it is the expression of his personal dignity."""
1,Take this book with you on your trip to Spain,"After struggling in the field using this guide, I almost gave up trying to identify mushrooms. Then I checked the publishing info and found it was written in Spain with photo credits from London, Milano, Paris....This is a European translation from the early 80's, don't make the mistake I did!I then randomly opened the book and ran a search on the mushroom on the page: Cortinarius Albovioceus My search led to a mushroom expert's site that said this mushroom is found in Scandinavia and no specimen to the expert's knowledge was ever been found in North America.But I should say that the book has great photos that could be used as a secondary verification of an identity."
2,Not a Guide for North America,"I bought this book after someone showed it to me. After quickly looking at it and seeing the format I thought I would really like it, but I don't! I was surprised to open the book to the Pleurotus ostreatus and seeing it in the photo as a very dark brown mushroom. My four other field guides (and the only way I have seen it in the field) show it as a very pretty whitish mushroom like the one this book describes as the Pleurotus cornucopiae. I wonder were the descriptions mixed up or is this how they are in Italy where the book was first written and published. A very disappointing book! I should have read the copy right page and then I would have known that it was not a field guide for North America. I will stick with Mushrooms Demystified by David Arora and the Audubon Field Guide."
2,Not the best field guide.,"This book has nice mushroom information. Some good photos. But it is difficult to use as a field guide and often does not have the mushrooms that I find in the forest. I live in the southeast US and many mushrooms I find simply aren't listed.Worth buying if you want to read about mushrooms. Serves as a ""decent"" but not ""great"" field guide.Don't expect to buy this, head into the woods, and start identifying mushrooms. Fungus is difficult to identify and I find it better to take my own photos and then use multiple, online sites to compare photos.Again-- a good read. A good book. Not a very useful field guide for the southeast US."
3,Not for beginners,"Execelent photos! However, the book tells you that it's o.k. to experiment with the amanita family-not a good idea when starting out or even for a pretty good mushroom hunter unless you want a one way trip through the great golden gates of heven!"
2,Not Particularly Helpful,"The book is slickly produced, with good photographs, and I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information. But, I find it really hard to use. Mushrooms are organized by general type, but you still pretty much have to flip through tons of pages scanning for pictures that look close. Some of this is no doubt owing to our lack of knowledge, but... My wife and I have used this book to try to identify some of the hundreds of species of mushrooms growing on our property. So far, we've found two: the chanterelle and the morel, which we could have identified on our own without the book."
3,Not for an Amateur Mushroom Watcher,"The sheer number of photographs is astounding, but I was disappointed to find that most entries listed only botanical names and not common names which would have been helpful. Also I wish the varieties had been categorized as to continent so I could orientate myself faster.I had wanted to use this guide as an easy reference to identifying fungi spotted on hikes in SC and NC, but I found it a bit bewildering to use for a brand new mushroom watcher. I found Mushrooming Without Fear more appropriate to my current knowledge.However once I know more, I still plan to use it as a resource since it is encyclopedic in scope."
4,I like this one,"This is a pretty good book, although it contains mushrooms not found in North America. So they say. I am sure I found one that isn't supposed to grow here. (No analyitacl proof, but it didn't kill me)"
2,stick to the 1960's version,Stick to the older version of this book. I wish who ever thinks it is okay to republishing books with inferior illustration would just STOP! Just because it's for children doesn't mean the pictures should be rendered so crudely.
5,My favorite childhood book,"This is the first book I bought with my own money, at a library sale one summer afternoon.Skorpen weaves a poetic tale of a group of siblings as they explore more exciting places to live than a house. They live in a tree, on a beach, in a cave and so on, gathering momentos of each place before something happens to make them move on. In the end, they find that a house is a good place for children. On the way, Skorpen's well-crafted words sing and Burn's beautiful two-tone drawings make this book a memorable place for children. It is a book that is ""...a particular friend."" The later editions replace Burn's art with cartoonish color-mad images that cutsie up the whole thing and ruin the oetic impact. Go with the 1969 version, it is endlessly more beautiful!"
4,A lesson well learned with fun,"This beautifully illustrated story brought back great memories of my own treehouse days and cool campout nights. Great for sparking the imagination of young ones today toward creating their own memories. I had only one problem. It was with the text going from ""...our roof in the autumn turned scarlet and gold"" on one page and three pages later ""And pond frogs sang with us on summer nights."" The emphasis in both illustration and text leans heavily on autumn color and flavor. Did I miss something with the interjection of summer? This could be a little confusing for young readers. Otherwise a wonderful, whimsical journey."
5,great story with marvelous illustrations,"This is a great story with marvelous illustrations, but it is even more than that --- it makes you think. The kids really liked this one!!!!!!!"
5,Fond Memories,"We just sold our home last week, and we're still searching for a new house to purchase. I guess that is why the words to this book (that I haven't read since childhood) popped into my mind. I loved this book, and hope to find one of the earlier versions to read to my own children. They will probably suggest that we forget the whole house thing and live in a tree!Wasn't this a weekly reader book?"
5,If you teach in Texas this is a great tool.,I used this book with a 2nd grade unit on Texas. I got the idea from a friend who teaches 7th grade Texas History. Readers follow Timmy on an adventure through the state. He visits several great places along the way. It was fun to use the illustrations and the clues to try and figure out what area we were in. My students and I enjoyed our field trip across Texas. Tumbelweed Tom on the Texas Trail is another great tool for teachers.
4,the very best of Roy Orbison,Kind of brings back the days when he was popular. Still good listening. Many younger people have not heard these.
3,sticky paws,"Sticky Paws is tricky to apply, but does stick to upholstery . Follow the directions. DOES NOT STICK to furniture that has been treated w/ a stain repellant such as Scotch Guard.My two cats are not constant scratchers, so I suspect it will be a few days before I actually see their reaction to the stickiness of the tape.I did get an interesting tip from another online review - use a clear plastic carpet runner, pointy side up, on countertops: the cats jump up but won't like the bumpy surface and will avoid the counter tops after a few tries. Might also work across the back of couch or chair. I am going to figure out how to keep a piece across the corner and back of my couch, where the Sticy Paws tape doesn't adhere due to the ScotchGuard.Couch is two weeks old and I can already see pulls from the cats. Fabric is a type of microfiber that is supposed to be cat proof - obviously is not. But that's another gripe."
4,What I expected,"Exactly what I thought it would be. Cheap, but well constructed, wouldn't hang it outside though. This is in a classroom."
2,Illustrations could frighten a toddler,"I should have heeded the review I read describing the little girl standing in the puddle before I bought the book. The illustrations were frankly, a bit scary, and the author missed the opportunity to reassure the child that everyone has accidents, and that it's OK. Instead, the book just ends, showing the sad and confused child in the puddle. hello! I sent the book back straightaway!"
1,Shows HUMILIATION,"I bought this book thinking it would be helpful. The princess theme was a good one. But, I am SO GLAD I READ this book BEFORE I gave it to my little one. While it does show the little princess asking for her potty (a good message), it does not show encouragement or making the child feel better after her ""accident"". It has the poor child standing in a puddle, redfaced, emabrrassed, and with sad eyes. It shows the humiliation a child may feel if it doesn't get to the potty in time. And, may, make her afraid to go without the diaper for fear of not getting there in time. I was appalled. So much that I will not even donate this book or give it away. It is going into the trash."
5,Untapped talent from Seattle via Japan,"If you want something that's unique and powerful, purchase this. Aiko Shimada comes from Japan, but has made Seattle her home in the last few years. I came to her from a magazine clipping, which said she was ""jazz with a Japanese voice"". While there are some jazz stylings, her music is much more than that. If anyone remembers a band from the early 90's called Ether, this is what BLUE MARBLE sounds like. Relaxing, soothing music with an edge not found in today's popular music, which is good because I don't think the world is ready for someone as bright as Shimada. DJ Olive appears on this as well."
4,4th graders GET this.,"I use this video primarily with fourth graders, but occasionally with third or fifth. I'm a school counselor and we watch it in ""Lunch Bunch."" Most fourth kids are mature enough to get the sarcasm and puns, but even those who don't quite will enjoy some of the visual jokes. Some fifth graders turn their noses up at it because it's too ""young"" for them, but for the most part it gets the message across about being true to themselves, rather than what others want to project on them."
4,Sweden,"Very early book on archeological finds and a good source. No color plates probably due to early publishing, would have been nice to see a color plate of textiles."
1,Disappointing...,"I saw Nathaniel Mayer play at the 9:30 club in D.C. in November 2005 and was blown away by his act. His vocals were over the top and his voice filled up the hall. The best way I can describe his sound would be that it was like hearing Howlin' Wolf backed by The Stooges. I raced out and bought everything he had in print. This disc contains many of the songs he played the night I saw him, and I REALLY wanted to like it, but after several listens I don't. Nathaniel Mayer's voice sounds shot on this disc, as opposed to the powerful delivery he possessed live. At times it's almost painful to listen to. Overall, the songs just seem to lack the energy of Mayer's live show. As an opening act on the night I saw him, Mayer literally stole the show and remains one of the most memorable performers I've ever seen in concert. However, this album didn't measure up to my expectations."
3,Good but not for the money,this jam pack is awesome. It comes with tons of new loops and instruments and the installation disc only takes up about 5 GB on your computer. Though I'm enjoying this product I feel that is not worth the amount of money that I paid for it. I only bought this to play around with other instruments but if you are one who actually takes time and wrights music this is a great purchase for you.
1,Aller-Zip duvet cover,"The delivery process was excellent! But, the product was not good. It was too heavy and the comforter kept sliding around in it. My son eventually thought a monster lived in it!!!!"
1,Luxury Divas,"Although the belt was pretty (the one star), the belt arrived damaged and I had to send it back for a replacement/refund at my own expense - as per their policy. Needless to say, shotty quality & poor customer service...I will not purchase from Luxury Divas again."
1,Why Oh Why...?,"Drivel. Nonsense. Why oh why did I buy this garbage? Written by a 9/11 conspiracy theorist (this fact should be printed on the cover as a warning to sane people everywhere) passing himself off as a legit journalist, this book can not stink enough. I'm sure we've all seen the old ""9/11 by the Numbers"" emails (9+1+1 = 11 so of course the Govt is responsible for 9/11), this clown actually uses this email in his appendix as some kind of evidence. Evidence of what, I'm not exactly sure.Save your time & save your money. This book is not worth the paper it's printed upon."
1,BIased Book,"I thought the book was very biased, not a true representation of the Grove. The author was obviously slanted to getting his own views across to the readers."

1,Don't even get me started...,"...oh, too late. You got me started. My cousins, in an attempt to get my family off of our collective classic rock/soul/jazz (...), got us this for Christmas. You'd expect me, your friendly neighborhood sarcastic teenager, to love this album.You are wrong, buddy. This is the very definition of bad music. People might argue, ""It embraces four styles of music!"" to which I say, phaw. The Beatles' White Album uses surf music, reggae, country/western, protometal, blues, folk, rock and avant-garde. That's eight styles right there.Avoid it like the plague, especially Hot In Herre, the Creed song, and the No Doubt song."
4,overall a good compilation,There's a few songs that I don't listen to but overall it has at least 10 that I play regularly.
3,this years chart topping hits?,"I compiled a list of the CDs with its peak chart position on the billboard hot 100. this one looks alot more ""hit-worthy"" than totally hits 2002.1.

2,NOW That's What I Call Generic Commercial Corporate Junk! 11,"The only thing that saves this album from falling into 1-star abyss is Coldplay, Kylie Minogue and No Doubt (even though ""Underneath it all"" is by far thier worst track to date). Every NOW release reminds us who listen to great artists (the likes of which MTV-addicted kids will probably never know about) exactly what we shouldn't be listening to. Most of this album consists of embarrasingly BAD artists/songs... most notibly NELLY's HOT IN HERRE (what a good example of what hip-hop SHOULDN'T be), the ever-annoying joke Bon Jovi, sadly generic rock band Creed and incubus ripoff Hoobastank. If you are addicted to the worst of the worst genre known as ""pop"", just save your money and get the albums of somewhat-talented groups Coldplay or No Doubt. Or better yet go explore the world beyond pop and find out what your missing."
2,Nothing really Stands out it's just ok,these Compilations can be Interesting if there is a Real Balance?but aside from Norah Jones&Kylie Minogue nothing else really comes between there Songs overall.alot of Catchy Songs but not a Song that you go oh that is GReat like you are Tony The Tiger.
3,Good muisc for young teens,"The NOW series has generaly safe music that is popular among young teens around 13-14 years old. This is pretty much ""Back Street Boyz"" type music - harmless and little kids love it. Some of the songs are even catchy (though honestly most of it wouldn't appeal to anyone who's been out in the world)."
3,I want it,I want it but i dont have it yet. It looks like a great album i own all of the other NOW albums and i strongly suggest you add all of them to your CD collection. Each CD is full of hits and it is really good to play these songs at partys and dances because they are songs that are easy enough to recognize. They really know how to get the party started.

2,"Better than 12 & 10, but still....","Glad they have stuff from Dirty Vegas, Coldplay, & Norah Jones... but I already have the 1st 2 cds, & Norah's gotten a little over-hyped now. If you don't have Coldplays 2002 release, there's something wrong with you!! ""Landslide"" is an awesome song & has gotten remade over & over. I still prefer the Smashing Pumpkins version, but the Dixie Chicks didn't do too bad a job. They at least attempted to include more rock acts here, but I lost interest in Creed a LONG time ago. And ""Hot in Here"" has gotten just a LITTLE too much overplay!! Overall, a better attempt, but nothing to get me excited about."
1,wrong wrong cd,they sent me the wrong cd in a case that was destroyed and broken... christina aguilera is not now 11 and does not work either
3,One question,"You may or may not think this song is annoying - but I have to ask where is J-Lo's Jenny from the Block? Maybe it's b/c I live in NY and it might have gotten more play here, but is this not one of the biggest pop songs of 2002? I know it came out late but still BARE NAKED made it and not J-lo?? Come ON. NOW is loosing their edge."
2,Poor beyond poor beyond poor beyond poor beyond poor...,"I remember Christmas a couple years back, when I saw a CD wrapped under the tree. Hoping it would either be by the Beatles or a computer game, I eagerly unwrapped it. I thought, oh no not pop music, but gave it a chance anyway.I'm sorry I did. The first three songs are all raps, and you know my feelings toward rap (If you don't, I hate it.) Hot In Herre is on my list of overrated songs, although Weird Al's parody, Trash, is hilarious. A bunch of boring songs, then Landslide, which is okay...more boring songs...No Doubt? Dear God, don't let them hurt me! More boring songs...hey, Hero, that's good, Don't Know Why is too. More boring songs...In My Place, that one's good...more boring songs...ONE LAST BREATH? MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!Don't buy this."
1,It isn't as good as the others . . .,All the other Now's are so much better than this one. Really don't waste your money on it.
4,Songs that are hits!,"Well, I don't own this album, but I've heard most of the songs. Most of the time I am dissapointed by Now albums because of the fact that they usually are half major hits and half mediocre hits. This time I've heard most of them. The songs I haven't heard are ""Feel It Boy"" by Beenie Man, ""Days Go By"" by Dirty Vegas, ""Love At First Sight"" by Kylie Minogue, ""Ordinary Day"" by Vanessa Carlton, ""Somewhere Out There"" by Our Lady Peace, and ""Everyday"" by Bon Jovi. However, the hits they picked aren't the best. I liked ""One Last Breath"" by Creed, ""Hot In Herre"" by Nelly, ""Nothin"" by Noreaga, ""Gangsta Lovin"" by Eve, ""Bare Naked"" by Jennifer Love Hewitt, ""Hero"" by Chad Kroeger and Josey Scott, and ""Running Away"" by Hoobastank. However, ""Objection"" by Shakira, ""Underneath It All"" by No Doubt, ""Landslide"" by the Dixie Chicks, ""I Care 4 U"" by Aalyiah, ""Stingy"" by Ginuwine, ""Don't Know Why"" by Norah Jones, and ""In My Place"" by Coldplay all range from mediocre to horrible."

3,Brem review,"I thought the book was meant for women who do not know their identity. I felt that the majority of the book dealt with things women should obviously know. I understand Brem's purpose and why one must understand their strengths to succeed in a business world. It is a great book, however, the book was not for me."
3,Good as can be for subject,Obviously dry subject. Good as you can ask for for a constitutional law textbook. Very clear and easy to follow and a textbook you should hope your professor uses for the subject matter.
3,not that good of book,"i didnt care for this book, Charlotte got on my nerves from the start, she was a preachers daughter and she was annoying as hell, will was okay but he put up with to much from her,and if your a avid book reader who enjoys romance in your books its not for you, it has sex in it about 200pages into a 296 page book, and wasnt even worth putting into the book, just skims over it, this was my first time reading a book from this author and i think i will pass on trying anymore, the plot was good, he is willing to take her to her destination after her wagon trail is burned out and she is kidnapped by Indianans and he rescues her. it sounds better than what it was."
2,missing some very important things.,"this book is better than others on this topic. however, it missed some very important things such as what components should be downloaded and how to set tem up to test the examples. all programs in this book are missing the packages needed to be imported.is this book written to impress colleages of the authors? if the intension is to help the mess understand and use Javaspace, then i would like to ask the author to fill in the missing parts! reading this edition of the book, i felt as if i was admiring the world's tallest building, but as soon as i went inside, i found the builder had forgotten to put in the elavators!"
4,Good book,This is a good book. It's simple and easy to read. Cover a lot of details about JavaSpaces.
1,"Nice theory, no practice!","You know, this is a great idea/science project...but wait, it does not work...Examples don't compile, classes are not found, the technology is immature and the people on the sun archives for Javaspace are unable to get this stuff working too. Um, This reminds me of the Rome and Gehani Concurrent C and Concurrent C++ projects... great ideas, bad execution!"
2,Outdated,"Upon opening this book I was excited. Until I try to work with the examples and found that the examples were based on jini 1.0.The current jini release is 1.2.1 and some of the packages are different. I guess if I knew jini and javaspaces I could modify the examples to work with the new jini version, but then I wouldn't need the book."
4,FG,Very helpful especially if you don't have any instructions at all! Fun game. Wish there was a 32 bit version of this and Panzer General
2,Not bad if you've never seen a good game guide.,"This was the third game strategy book I got (after Master of Magic and Master of Orion II). I was seriously disappointed. In other Prima books there is a wealth of material about how the game resolves conflicts/battles, conducts it's turn, etc. Tables of data and statistics, which while sometimes dry, were often useful and insightful. In this one there was a ""walk-through"" (and a few tables) with little material about what was happening behind the scenes and what strategies there were to deal with it. It was almost like an Adventure or RPG guide rather than a strategy guide. Very disappointing especially given some of the other (very good) work Terry Coleman has done."
5,My Favorite Metal Pedal,Originally I bought this & did not realize it was merely a module & requires the Tone Dock pedal to operate. What honked me off was that Amazon doesn't have the Tone Dock in stock & there's nothing stating when & if they'll get anymore in. SO I went online looking for one & found a place that had some Tone Docks left in stock.Plugging them in worked great & the tone? OMG! Balls to the wall! There's three settings the first is like gives you more of a Hair Metal Band sound. It's reminiscent of my Ibanez LA Metal pedal. The second setting is very much like the Boss Metal Zone sound because it's right in your face. The last setting is what they label 'insane' but really it's just a tweaked up bit of the second setting.The equalizer works nice & gives you a lot of varying tones to play with.I give this pedal a 5 out of 5 rating because it delivers.
4,A Glorious Collection of Songs,"A fiery blast of praise and worship sings out on this 1988 album. The title track is a fresh version of Psalm 150. ""Love Will Be Our Home,"" written by Steven Curtis Chapman, is a wonderful celebration of family and inclusivity. Not only is this a great listening album, but all of the songs are possible numbers for local worship service consideration. ""In Majesty He Will Come"" is a thrilling follow-up to ""We Shall Behold Him.""Songs for the JourneyA Morning Like This"
4,Spinneret republished!,"I didn't realize this book was first published in 1985! I really enjoyed this book. It never feels dated, and I kept thinking I knew where it was going, and that I was close to the end. Then it kept going places I didn't expect it to go! That, to me, is the mark of a good book - at least, if the story goes to unexpected places in a good way. Spinneret definitely did."
2,You spin me right 'round...,"Length:: 4:41 Minsyoutube.com/eloiseinparisThis is a rerelease of the 1985 novel for old and new fans alike. I had never read any of the author's work before, and found this an interesting introduction. I liked the retro, 80's cold war feel to the book. While it was well written but I didn't connect to any of the character's, and some ""issue's"" seemed to be a bit to easily solved. The main problem was after all the build up, the ending was lackluster. Zahn is a loved author, fan's of his who have never read this may find yourselves a bit disappointed, and if you're like me and are new to his work this probably isn't the place to start."
2,Huge disappointment,"The cookie recipes are disappointing. Some are for cookies that are not sturdy enough for cookie decorating. I found the proportions of ingredients in many of the recipes off, to the point where either they were too greasy or the cookie dough couldn't hold together. However, the instructions for how to decorate using different types of icing were helpful. I think this is a good book for ideas or design inspiration, but skip the recipes."
5,Learn why E.T. isn't going to phone us,"Basalla has produced an absolutely fantastic overview of the history of speculation about life on other worlds and the scientific quest to communicate with intelligent aliens. He manages to top himself by collecting a series of devastating arguments that reveal the anthropomorphism that has always tainted, and continues to taint, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. (Aliens are trying to reach us with radio telescope technology? Really? Why, what a convenient coincidence-that's same technology we're using to try to talk to them!) In a scant 200 pages, Basalla manages to place the search for E.T. in unvarnished perspective as the quasi-theological longing it is. This book should be required reading for all SETI buffs."
3,"Perhaps a necessary corrective, but ...","The author, a professor of history, makes a valid complaint about pro-SETI astronomers and biochemists who are ignorant of evolution and social science, but he shows his own lack of physical science background in such oxymoronic terms as ""high resolution microwaves."" He finds SETI's proponents -- notably Percival Lowell (who insisted on a Mars populated with canal-builders) and his ""successor"" Carl Sagan -- guilty of parochial if not delusional thinking. While perhaps a necessary corrective to Sagan's over-enthusiasm, this book swings the pendulum to the other side with its insistence that even if ""they"" were ""out there,"" we would never be able to communicate with them. How can we know for sure without a thorough search?"
1,gunk junk,"Impossible to clean thoroughly.I tried many different methods,but the gunk won't come off.A waste of money.going back to my lightweight Teflon grill pan."
2,Not Linda Chaikin's best,"Linda Chaikin is my favorite author, but this is definitely not her best book. It is pretty boring, and the characters are frustrating. If you read this book, don't decide to not read her other books! Monday's Child and Tuesday's Child are far better. So is Arabian Winds, Lions of the Desert, and Valiant Hearts."
1,tiny! useless! garbage!,I was not happy upon reception of the product. I feel that I wasted my money. The holder is tiny. Paid $15 for it and can't give it away!
2,only for beginners,"this is a WONDERFUL book for rookies to the spa world, but a waste of time and money for anyone who has ever even worked as a spa receptionist. for $50 i expected a little more substance and strategic advice (as the title hints to) as opposed to hand-holding spa 101. and don't you think for $50 it should be hardcover and have color pictures? grossly over-priced in my opinion. i had it packaged and ready for return within 15 minutes of receiving it."
4,"COMPREHENSIVE, VERY DETAILED BUT A BIT DRY",If you are an Alfred Hitchcock fan this book is definitely a must. It provides incredible detail on each one of his movies. Much of the information has been previously published but it does provide some new information including a comprehensive step by step review of each movie's production. The book also includes details of his personal life - however these parts tended to be less detailed.Two criticisms - I found the pre-production details of some of the movies to be too much -- tedious and dull (i.e. the convoluted succession of writers) while the actual and post production details (which would be more interesting) to be sketchier. Also lacking was the author's input - he very rarely gave his opinion. Obviously after so much research and interviewing he could have provided more insights!
3,Hitch Behind the Scenes,"As a syndicated film critic, I read a lot of books about movie stars, old films, and notable directors. And it would be no surprise that Alfred Hitchcock -- in all his twisted, petty glory -- is one of my favorite filmmakers. From ""The 39 Steps"" and ""The Lady Vanishes"" to ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window,"" Hitch was to become one of the world's most influential directors. This volume takes a look at the man, his relationships, his movie themes driven by his own psychological makeup -- from innocent men persecuted to icy blondes. Add it to your bookshelf. Then watch the movies again."
5,Is there a more revered director in movie history?,"Almost a quarter century has passed since Sir Alfred Hitchcock went to that great movie studio in the sky and the legacy that he left behind remains unsurpassed by any of his contemporaries or those that followed him. Hitchcock understood all aspects of film: story and plot elements, character development, set design, music, pacing, and audience reaction. Possibly his greatest attribute was his skill at self-promotion and marketing.He surrounded himself with the best writers and artisans in order to bring to life some of the cinema's most memorable works of art.This most exhaustive biography of the legend covers the entirety of the filmmaker's life, beginning with a brief glimpse of his ancestors to his death at the age of eighty in 1980.Fans of the director will consider this book a godsend and savor every page. Aspiring film craftsman will find the book as the definitive ""how-to"" text on becoming a success!"
1,Can I get my money back?,"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Chick Corea. I picked up this DVD hoping to get some insight into his playing, soloing, comping. I got none of that. The first part is dedicated to L. Ron Hubbard quotes, and then he spends 20 minutes reading sheet music. He does some amazing sols at times, but does not slow it down or explain any theory behind it. I paid $40 to see him read music, solo a couple of times for no reason, and preach dianetics. I did not learn one thing.The only cool part is the jam with Patitucci and Brechtlein."
2,Misleading Title,"Chick starts with an impressive performance of 1950's jazz standards on an acoustic piano. Then he lazily combines several factory preset sounds on synthesizers. Finally he gets his drummer and bass player to join his own odd angular set of chords. I feel sorry for Chick's musicians, who are basically micromanaged by him into unnecessarily tedious and difficult patterns."
2,not educational,"if you want to see chick talk about music, play some jams, and vaguely describe what's going on, buy this. if you're looking for instruction look elsewhere as there is literally none to be found here"
1,This is horrible...Buy the CD with Pavarotti and Freni,"This CD was horrible. It was not worth the money to buy. If you are looking for amazing singing, purchase the London version starring Lucciano Pavarotti and Mirella Freni. Also, if you want to see a performace of La Boheme in New York, don't go to La Boheme on Broadway. See La Boheme at the Metropolitan Opera House. It is worth the money. The set is beautifully done by Franco Zefferelli and the singing is much better than the Broadway production. The chlidren in the produciton at the Met are also extroadinay and very talented for their ages."
1,WHOOPS........!,"More than five stars for the CD cover and the tiny, tiny, tiny libretto with dy-no-mite photos circa 1957 ..... but in all fairness to the Young, Young Young cast ... this one's quite terrible.One has to in all fairness {or unfairness} compare this version to the original 1993 Australian version WITH SINGERS, and there really is no comparision. David Hobson set the bar way, way high for any future Rodolfo as did Cheryl Barker's unforgettable Mimi. This present version just does not work on CD due to the confusion of the mixed cast - especially the highly 'indicated' theatricality of one of the Mimis - great in the looks department - but the emoting .....!The original version tends to be a 'Method' Puccini - AND it works.Try to get that [imported] CD instead - besides the original was recorded 'live' so the stakes were higher ....."
4,Alfie Boe singing opera.,No need to say anything else really. Alfie Boe singing opera will be great everytime. The rest of the performers are also very good and it is a pleasure to listen to this over and over again.
5,On time,"I love this soundtrack! I bought this CD after watching the movie! In 5 days I will be performing in RENT at the Janesville Performing Arts Center in Janesville, WI! I have learned more about these characters from watching and listening to LA BOHEME!!Thanks!! I received it on time!!"
4,Good Display Item,"I bought this, with several other flags to show my heritage at my wedding. They are now exhibited in my den, adding to the atmosphere. They would work well for outdoor display, too, but would not hold up well in the long run."
5,Great movie!,"This is a great movie! I'm glad I own it on blu ray. Edward Norton does an excellent job playing twins. The movie is funny, sad, quirky but certainly not dull!"
2,I wish I could have the time back!,"I think Edward Norton is an underrated actor. The problem with this movie is the script. Boring to say the least, I should not have relied on the 4 star average. Some wrote about the comedy of it all...where? This movie downright SUCKED!"
3,Eh,I bought this movie because I am big fan of Ed Norton. Mr. Norton didn't disappoint but I feel the movie's plot is lacking something. Rent it.
2,Didn't watch,"Haven't even been able to get into this movie, so have set aside for some other viewing day. May give away."
2,very poor dull movie,It another one of those movies where twins are played by the same actor.This tired old trick was cute years ago with the Parent Trap.But now it's dull now matter what type of plot they try.This one is about a pot grower and a school teacher.Maybe this might of been interesting if they had used real twinsas the actors.Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents andpretending to look at himself as a twin.This very old visual trick never works.You can tell when people do not make real eye contact witheach other.This film might have even been interesting if they had usedtwo different actors who look kind of alike.But overall it's not funny or full of action like Pinapple Express.Don't waste your time.
2,Smothered Brothers (2.5 stars),"Stacking the plates and glasses of broad comedy, culture clash, intellectual and existential concerns, and extreme violence onto a single tray is a delicate balance. Tim Blake Nelson's shaggy dog caper spills them all on the dining room floor. He's clearly shooting for the humor, dread and sudden jolts of the Coen Brothers (right down to the extremely Carter Burwell-esque score), but like a fair number of the characters in this film, his aim is askew. The tone is all over the place and in the end, none of it really adds up to anything substantial. Edward Norton plays twin brothers who are polar opposites -- a feat that once again proves dual roles are rarely a good idea."
1,Thoroughly disappointed.... (spoiler alert),"I'm sorry - - but I have to say that this was a painful movie to watch till the end. The plot was not very believable to begin with and then the logical leaps just added to the dissatisfaction. For example, it's just not plausible for the orthodontist to run back home after hearing on the radio that Pug Rothbaum had been killed - and then do an internet search on Bill Kincaid whom he had met very briefly on the plane - and put two and two together that somehow the person he saw at the Synagogue was the identical twin brother of Bill - and that this brother had killed Pug and was using Bill as an alibi... Sound confusing? Well, it was. Ed Norton delivers on his acting but even that felt over-the-top and just not believable. Maybe I was expecting a little more from the cast and the effort is evident - but this movie was not my cup of tea."
1,Resealed = new to seller,"Length:: 0:21 MinsThis seller claimed to be selling a new bluray but product I received was a poorly resealed used copy. Removed shrinkwrap after video and pieces of factory packaging were still attached. Small strips near opening that often stay attached to blurays when opening older discs .. Disc has two small marks. Cracked case etc dont buy not worth savings if you want new or trustworthy dont shop with this seller.Update: Sellers response was that they reseal some discs if the disc is loose within the case. If that is the case that should be in the product description, leaving that out is only further evidence of trying to conceal what would obviously lower the selling value."
3,IT'S DOPE!,"LEAVES OF GRASS is not a film adaptation of Walt Whitman's poetic celebration of our common humanity, although it plays with some of the same key elements of life's simple pleasures as well as its sudden brutality.Ed Norton delivers one of his best performances in this little-seen film about twin brothers: one an Ivy League classics professor and the other an Oklahoma redneck dope dealer. When the two worlds collide, the philosophical tenets of higher civilization are tested in the real world of criminal aspirations. Not many films mix Aristotle, catfish noodling, Oklahoma synagogues and crossbow killings. It all begins when the insulated professor gets word his twin has been murdered. But when he arrives in Oklahoma, he realizes he's been hoodwinked into a dangerous scheme that he can't easily avoid.Writer Tim Blake Nelson is great in front of an behind the camera and Keri Russell charms as a love interest who channels Whitman's spirit."
4,"Good, but grim","I enjoyed this move. I thought it had character and realism. That said, I think it is wrong to call it a comedy. It is a fairly hard hitting movie that has very graphic violence and a gritty taste. The comedy is almost all based on tragedy.I don't recommend it for folks that aren't ready for movie that is rated R based on violence and needs to be.Good movie, but don't be fooled by characterizations you may read."
4,Another great Norton film,This is an off beat film with a strong indie vibe. The cast was really good and the plot was a little weird but in a good way.It is a film that grows on you more and more as the film progresses. I strongly recommend watching this if you like films where dialouge makes the film not action.
3,"Ok movie, nice bluray",The movie is cool to watch. Nothing special but worth buying if you are a Norton fan. I am Jack's Medula Oblongata.
1,Piece of Junk!,"At the beginning, the keyboard and mouse worked fine. After less than one year however, after the second battery change on the mouse, the entire thing quit working. Logitec support told me they would replace if I still had the original receipt and if it was still under warranty, but it was not a receipt I kept. Many internet sites mention the same problem with their products. So take note, if you buy a Logitec item, keep your receipt and your warranty, as they obviously produce junk and sell it to the public."
4,If you like black licorice ......,"you'll like the way this tea tastes. I don't particularly care for black licorice but it is subtle enough in this tea that I can handle it. Recently I ran out of Yogi Kava Stress Relief (tastes like chocolate and it's sweet) to which I did not notice anything. I wanted to give this St. Johns Wort a try and see if it does the job.I just steeped two teabags and put in some blue agave nectar. I'll report back with an update soon to see if my ""blues"" have gone away.UPDATE: Been more than a week and well......don't notice anything really. Used two tea bags a day so they were gone in 8 days (16 tea bags in the box)."
4,Excellent Quality Ingredients,"The ingredients are fresh and wholesome. However, the taste is in my opinion, bland. It is effective but you must be consistent in its use. Use it daily and be patient. After several weeks, you will notice that you are feeling much better. I have to brew it with another flavor of the Yogi tea because I do not like the taste. It does not taste nasty, just very bland. The results are worth it."
3,It does work but...,"I bought this tea because i have used st.johns wort in tincture form and know that it works. This tea does work for depression and a general blue feeling...but it does not taste good. I love drinking tea; most of what I drink is tea and I drink a multitude of different types from matcha, chai, red zinger, etc, But this tea just taste god awful. It isn't vomit inducing awful (excuse the mental picture) but it is not pleasant at all. This doesn't mean someone else won't like it, but I don't. Someone said it taste like black licorice, and that may be, but I couldn't say as I have never had black licorice. I don't like licorice of any kind though, so it probably does taste like that. At any rate, I would recommend buying 1 box first, just in case."
4,Max Relax vice Sleepy & Dozing,"I am 45 years 'young' and I know stress intimately. I am a disabled veteran with stress related injuries and this product has helped keep stress at bay. Dealing with irritable people, you know the people who know how to push our buttons, the ones who don't go away. Drinking this tea will help you as it has helped me. The taste is okay, doable especially since it works so well for me."
2,Ugggg. The taste...,"I saw the rave reviews for this tea, and I decided to do an experiment and try this tea along with the Traditional Medicinals St. John's Wort Good Mood tea. They should have been similar, although it looks like the Yogi tea has more St. John's Wort in it. I've had several cups of both now, and without a doubt the Yogi tea tastes way too licoricey and like it has a fake sweetener in it. The Traditional Medicinals tastes WAY better to me, with a more subtle licorice flavor and no weird fake sweetener taste. Also, it makes me feel better than the Yogi tea. It gives me a little boost, which I'm not feeling with Yogi. Sorry, but I tried it a few times to make sure! If anyone else wants to try the same experiment, I'd be interested in your opinion as well!!!"
4,great for those smart people in your life,only took my dad about 3 hours to complete. Ive had one for about 3 months and have yet to solve it.
5,The One To Get,"This album has melody, charm, wisdom and everything ui want in a good album. This album is mu favorit so far of 2001.Everyone get if.if u dont ahve it already"
2,Gets very annoying very fast,"I changed my mind about this band. I don't know what I was on the day I gave them five stars, but I literally must have been intoxicated when I heard this and called it ""amazing"". After about two listens they get really annoying. And I've seen the ""I'm a Cloud"" video way too many times on Mtv Rock and I even change the channel to Much Music when they come on now (which shows you just how irritating this band is if I'd rather watch Much Music then them). I hate it when bands choose their worst song as the single. I really don't know what song would be better though, as they are all pretty bad. The only reason I'm not giving this 1 star is because I reserve that for the truly horrible scum of the musical world (such as Drowning Pool, Blink 182, Limp Bizkit, and 'Nsync)."
3,pretty good,"I like many of the songs on this album, although people keep banging on about how it's 'new', 'never been done before', but personally I think it sounds quite similar to Incubus and sounds VERY similar to Silverchair, which was done in 1995. Silverchair's Frogstomp sounds more orginal in my opinion."
2,"A few interesting songs, but mostly cliched","I used to love this CD. I thought it was the best debut of 2001, and completely original. Then I realized that if you take away the twelve - string guitar, Boy Hits Car is just an ordinary hard rock band. I mean, look at ""The Rebirth."" The riffs are very tired, because the only thing supporting the song is the twelve stringed guitar. The first nine tracks are all like that, even the supposedly original ""Going to India."" The last two tracks save the CD, however. ""Benkei"" is the only place in the CD where Boy Hits Car feels comfortable enough to lose the twelve string acoustic, and do a real rock tune. ""Before We Die"" is a great soft rock song with flute solos dispersed throughout. If those songs weren't on the CD, I would have given it 1 star.Boy Hits Car is definatly an average band. If you don't want to waste your money, download the last two tracks, and get ANThology by Alien Ant Farm instead. That is the only good debut of 2001, so far."
2,powerful cd and a powerful live performance,"I actually first heard of 'Boy Hits Car'when i went to the snocore tour in Providence. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but oh my ..... god, they blew me away. A bare foot, curly haired, acoustic guitar playing lead singer (the acoustic actually sounds cool, go figure), and a powerful guitarist, drummer and bassist pulled off an amazing and emotional performance. Unlike other bands they were appreciative of any positive feed back and thanked us for having so much energy, which i thought was really nice. after the concert i imediatley went out and bought their cd and it is as bad ass as their performance, emotional and powerful..... i tell you. Love core is my favorite song on this cd, i don't know why, it just is. But to Boy Hits Car, your sticker is on my door, your cd on my shelf and i'm definatley comming to your next show! p.s continue to rock on"
5,"Boy Hits Car, the rebirth of Rage Against The Machine.","When I picked up their sampler from a concert for the Deftones and heard it, I was impressed. But when I downloaded a few of the songs on this album, I had to buy the CD. After having done so, I can tell you that I don't regret it. The lead singer (an 12 string acoustic guitarist!) sounds like Serj Tankian (SoaD) and Zack De La Rocha (RaTM) into one human powder keg! The bass is in full form and I am drawn into to the melody they use. Loud as hell and soft as heaven, I am a BIG fan of this band. Get this CD. Trust me."
5,An excellent CD,"Boy Hits Car has some of the most amazing lyrics and instrumentals. One of the great things about this CD is that every song is excellent not just a few. This is one of those CDs you just stick in and let play, instead of flipping through the songs."
5,Very Surprising...,"I have to say that I , in the beggining, was not really interested in this ecause it seemed like just some more nu-metal. Well, I heard ""Man Without Skin"" on the radio and had to get this album. I was very (yet pleasently) surprised by the C.D. itself. It was kind of wierd to hear the vocalist (during a somewhat mellow background) to spew out cusses like rain. No I'm not oddended, but it was pretty cool to get that mixture of rage and melody at once. This album is a must have for people who like stuff that is different than most. This gets the seal.-FM"
4,Better Than Other Nu Metal,"From someone who HATES nu metal, this is a really cool album. I think, if so many reviewers weren't so bloody ignorant to GOOD music, there'd be more comparisons to Rush here. Musicaly it pales in comparison, but that vocal comparison you all have been searching for is Rush. It's crazy how much ""man without skin"" sounds like a Rush song. With shouting. And lack of intelegence. But hey, it's better than Adema."
2,Sell-outs,"Dude, man, I used to be a big fan of BoyHitsCar (henceforth referred to as Blue Oyster Cult (or BOC)) when they released The Day the Sun Went Out and After the Eulogy, which I thought were both great albums. Then they went and changed record labels from Victory to Wind-up, where they end up with bands like Creed (bleggh, Christian metal), Drowning Pool (yay!), and Finger Eleven (Chuck Chuck Chuck *and/or Chick Chick Chick or !!!*). That's not cool man. They sold out their indie roots for a buck. I give BOC one extra star because they remind me of the Nerve Agents. Yeah bro!"
2,2 stars,"2 stars, no more, no less. 2 stars because this stinks. 2 stars because it has some melody. 2 stars because I don't like music like this. 2 stars because the cd is only shouting."
1,don't waste time or money,"I bought this album on the recommendation of The Pit magazine, which said that the album was brilliant, unique, innovative and that the vocals resembled those of System of a Down's. I was let down on all counts. the album is a repetive and dull pile of waste. The musicianship was mediocre, like many of their fellow nu-metal bands. The acoustic twelve string guitar that was supposed to be a significant element of the album was underemphasized and played unintelligently. Each song sounded the same, with Craig's obnoxious, whiny vocals unrelenting over the monotonous background noise of the same wimpy riffs. I tried to listen to it several times, but it was simply unbearable and I couldn't make it through. For anyone one considering buying this album I can't urge you enough not to do so. It is by far the worst album I have bought in along time. I only wish I could give it less stars."
5,Huh... puzzling,I'm in quite a cunundrum... i hate modern rock... but i love this cd... hm perplexing... buy this cd for it is good
4,So Damn Refreshing,"I knew nothing of the band before purchasing the album other than they were a little different. Anyone sick of the rap-metal scene should look at boy hits car, its strange that i did not hit the next track button on my remote as usally one song seems to always do that to you but i found with the great vocals and diverse sounds ( that will no-dought be linked to nu-metal)left me listening to the whole 45 minutes begging for more......"
5,Amazing and Mesmerizing,Boy Hits Car is one of those bands that will definatly make it big. Their music is very unique and the lyrical style is amazing too. I saw them on Snocore and they were an awesome band. They performed live very well. And they are very much in tune with their audience. Be ready to hear a lot from this new band in the future.
4,good,"Boy Hits Home with this debut disk. Introducing sitar, tabla, and other middle eastren instruments is not commen in todays nu metal world. Although boy hits car is a little off center music/lyric wise to be put under the catacory nu metal, there is a certain commercailism about them. The singer for this band is very emotional, blending to gether high and low ranges seamlessly. the other three musicians could easily be replaced, though.-Dan"
5,a brilliant band!,"I first heard of this band when the Ozzfest line-up was announced. I was curious to say the least! I saw a short interview with Boy Hits Car soon after on MuchMusic. Then I heard the sound...the sound that 4 gifted musicians make when slammed together! These guys have such a refreshing sound for the growing world of hard rock! Flutes, sitars, bongos...freakin' brilliant! Soulfly and Boy Hits Car seem to be the only guys around that figured that intense sound can be brought forward with more than guitars. BHC gives you a new alternative to the rap/rock thing that's busy being stale right now...just ask Fred Durst... I am convinced that Boy Hits Car are going to make quite a mark in the world of music, if you don't have this album yet...trust me it's worth it!"
4,SEE THE LIVE SHOW,i went to see a show and these guys happned to be on the Bill. ONE WORD AWESOME... great presence on stage. you cant go wrong BUY the CD its 10 bucks and well worth every penny...
5,one hell of a good buy,i first heard about these guys when i found their cd sampler on the street on my way home from a (hed) p.e. concert. I didnt pay any attention to it til about 3 weeks ago when I was bored so I popped it in my cd player. and i can say that these guys have something really good going on. I hope i can see them live some day. so if you wanna get a good cd get this one
2,Be Sure You Get What You Ordered,"These are lovely, which is why I ordered them - too bad I didn't get them! I ordered these Antique Initial Monogram from Craftersnet to go with some gold foil embossed invitations. My invoice from Craftersnet reflects that this product is the product I ordered. However, what I received is not what is pictured here, but rather a silver seal with a black monogram on it. Those seals are nice as well, but obviously aren't going to work on the gold embossed invitations. These are pretty cheap, and I figured it didn't make sense to spend the money on postage to return them, so I'll keep them and probably use them on another occasion. However, I'm not too happy about ordering one thing & getting something completely different. I've learned my lesson - go to a stationary store to be sure you get what you want."
3,For Beginning Finger Pickers Only,"I hate to lessen the 5 star avg here, but I bought the digital copy and wish I could get a refund. I did not realize that this video was solely for learning the absolute basics of finger picking. If you already have a foundation for using your thumb and 1st 3 fingers to pick, you will gain little from this video. The first 40 minutes explain how to arch your fingers and to properly pluck. The later half, how to squeeze your hand properly on the neck and groom your finger nails. I agree that this video would be ideal for somebody just learning guitar or finger picking. However, if you are interested in learning advanced finger picking styles or exercises, this is not for you.The instructor does intro each lesson with amazingly technical pieces, but never breaks them down. It is such a tease!"
5,Nice portable worktable!,"Picked this up from Amazon when it was on sale for fathers day which made this an amazing deal. Had I had to pay the regular price, this would still be an excellent addition to any shop. I purchased this blind as I'd never seen one in person and there weren't any reviews here.(which I rely on heavily when buying items)This is one sturdy little table.I had wanted to purchase the Black and Decker WM425 but I'm glad I held out and waited. This table is more versatile.The dolly feature works well. I've hauled planters weighing over 150lbs on the dolly and it worked well.The vise feature works well.The table is sturdy and the overall quality of the item is very high. It should last forever. There is a 5-10 minute setup out of the box which is very easy.I'm glad I own this item."
2,Barely useful for woodworking,Bought it with high hopes based on good reviews. It was easy to setup. It shakes a lot when I used it for cross cutting 1 X 12 pine. As a result I could not cut in a straight line. I needed to bevel one of the edges at 45 degrees using a chisel and the shaking was even worse. The dogs are pathetic pieces of plastic. Overall not very useful if you plan to use it for woodworking with hand-tools. good luck.. caveat emptor!
3,Better than average for this type of tool,"Overall this is well built and sturdy. Pretty heavy though. The table is good and the vice usable. The indoors only is due to a dubious electrical one plug to 3 gadget, that frankly I would not use indoors. A simple clip to hold a heavy duty cable or GFI cable would be much more useful. I could not get the cotter pin into the axle hole even with considerable pressure from some very large vice grips so IMHO with the cranks on handles not lining up I can't give this really high build quality rating--not bad at all though.Where this is most useful is for an occasional set of tools like a cordless drill/saw/etc. set which can be stored on the dolly and then wheeled into position for use. Overall this is to heavy for the dolly feature to be really useful. Pretty good but doesn't knock my socks off."
5,A Great Value!,"I used to have a Black & Decker WorkMate, but gave it away when I moved across country. When I needed another similar portable work-stand, I saw this on Amazon, bought it and have been very pleased. It's easy to assemble, rugged and a solid work-station. At first I thought that I'd prefer the laminated wood (separable) top that the B & D had, but these plastic ones on the Stanley are plenty-tough (and well reinforced). And I don't miss the ""feet"" always falling out of the legs on the B & D. I don't think I'll use it as a hand truck, but the wheels make it so much easier to move around (when in folded position), rather than carrying it.One thing I's like to see, an accessory that would allow a wider ""grip"", like when I want to work on a larger item (such as a large picture frame). I've made one up, but I'm sure Stanley could do better! (Are you listening, Stanley?... I'll provide a design suggestion for much less than an AIG exec's bonus!)"
2,Poorly made,This item was very poorly made. It works but not as smoothly as advertised. Not to mention if you want to use the hand truck watch out for the pins/ screws coming out.
4,Square and yellow,"NIce looking watch, but a bit on the thick side, almost 1/2 inch. Nice watchband quality. Very pleased with this product, even considering the modest price. Nice curved face and case profile"
5,"pure, sweet music","You will find here early versions of many of Bob Marley's songs that he later re-recorded for big hits. Perry and his band The Upsetters join reggae music's greatest vocal trio ever in my opinion: Bob, Peter and Bunny . The songs are quite stripped down in fact and do not showcase Perry's later technical wizardry. However, I have read that Perry was a great influence on Marley and in particular his signature vocal style. Worth checking out although I suppose they are going to have to reissue the disc if you want to avoid paying the exorbitant used price listed above (over $100). BTW: that imported 2002 CD up there appears to be different than the box set of the Complete Upsetter Collection which is what I reviewed."
5,"no miracles, good tea","this is not going to make anything strong unless it was strong anyway.but it is a nice tea, and you increase energy a little bit."
3,Doesn't work like a wok,"Heat is evenly distributed and it heats up quickly. However, meat and vegetables don't sear the same way as in a regular wok without a non-stick coating. The vegetables don't get cooked up with some crispy texture left in them. There is definitely a lack of sizzle factor--the moisture of the meat and vegetables is seared in a non-stick wok as the food hits the wok. In this non-stick wok, the moisture just becomes juice in the wok. I find it doesn't give the same results although clean-up is a snap and there is no scrubbing and soaking the wok when you're done. I am back to using a regular non-stick wok."
5,Everybody gets involved,The thrill of a lifetime: We skype our 20 month old grandchild. He sits alongside his dad who guides the toddler's hand to play the melody while (dad) plays the accompaniment. We all sing along to the songs we learned as children. The next joy will come when the grandson is able to play and sing all by himself - - - which may not be too long since the arrangements are pretty simple. A nice assortment of music and lyrics we had long forgotten.
5,100 Songs for Kids,"This book includes nearly all the old nursery rhymes plus many other songs children like, plus the accompaniment is very simple for any beginning pianist. A great find - it was just what I was looking for."
2,CD started skipping after played only onces,The cd that was purchased started skipping and it had some small scratches on it I wanted to returned it but my mother said she would just keep it. I bought it for her for only 88cents no great loss but I was unhappy with the product. Maybe next time I should purchase it new.
3,Sterling Silver 8 Row Necklace,Item looks wonderful...but does not lay flat on the neck. Had a couple of kinks..I am returning the product.
4,Poor instructions.,"But for the poor instructions, I would rate the product a 5 star. I still have parts left over that I don't know what to do with."
3,not like the pic,I thought this was so cute - and even though I can make it work - what I got does not look this picture. I wish the picture was more accurate
1,CONSCIOUSNESS SQUEAKS,"Ramesh S. Balsekar is still a young student of Self discovery at the time of these conversations. This book is the result of westeners longing for Ramana Maharshi and Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. Mr. Balsekar's thought is not well enough developed to be placed in a book and presented to the public, especially at a cost. Mr. Balsekar spoke of not being a parrot of his guru, well being a parrot would have made a better book and perhaps helped lead him to the understanding that it is I that AM and it cannot be any other way. A rose is a rose - is a rose. Awareness is Awareness and it parrots itself through illusive expressions(Ramana, Maharshi,Me). If a guru helps you to understand that the color of grass is green, what else can you say about the color of grass otherthan to parrot the guru and say that it is green. Awareness cannot be different from Awareness."
5,Excellent quality!,I looked around for covers for my outdoor furniture and decided on these because of other reviews. I was tired of having to buy new covers every other year because they ripped. These are thick and fasten with velcro for windy days. I am very happy with them and I feel they are worth the extra money.
1,Terrible!,"I am writing this review of Amazons Chaise covers about one year from the day of purchase, last June 2011. Considering the fact that I live on the East Coast these chaise covers were in use from June through Sept 2011. Then, they were stored inside for the Winter. In the late Spring of 2012 ( April / May) they were broken out and used again. Today is July 25, 2012 and they are literally falling apart. The fabric ( or whatever it is) is disentegrating and the holes are covered in duct tape. Considering the fact that these covers were not cheap, and provided adequate use for a period of approximately 7 months, I would have to rate their quality as one step up from a 4 cent plastic bag. These covers are dogs....stay far away!!!!Amazon.com: Protective Covers 1160 Weatherproof Cover for Chaise Lounge: Patio, Lawn & Garden"

1,I Bought FIVE! @#@%!!,The vinyl cracked and peeled off after only a couple months use. Complete JUNK! Please save yourself some money and DO NOT BUY this item....
1,You Get what you pay for!!!,I purchased 3 of these covers for my teakwood pool chairs I knew the minute I opened the box that these covers were going straight back to Amazon. The quailty of these covers are very poor I ate $12.00 in shipping charges but I sent them back the next day.
1,Outdated,"Too outdated and ""hokey"" for my liking. Paper covered suitcases, doilies, carousel horses, china with buttons and ribbons glued on and tole painted baby cribs .... lots of victorian styles and silk flowers. I'm sure someone more creative could use the ideas and add a more updated or trendier twist on some of the projects, but it's just not for me."
1,out of date,This book was published in 1996. It is so out of date to current trends. If you like vintage with a victorian look you might enjoy the book. I would like my money back.
3,NOT GREAT FOR FSX,"hey this is a good graphics card but not if you are playing hardcore PC games. i got mine for flight simulator x and it still cant be played on high settings. its great for the price but if i could do it again i would save up a little more and go with either a GeForce 7900 with 512MB or a GeForce 8800 with 512 mb, you'll be happier!"
3,Good Card But Outdated - Get a 9500,"The GeForce 8500GT 512MB is a good little graphics card. If you can get one for under 50 bucks for a low to mid range system and don't plan on playing the latest 3D intensive games, then it is a good choice. I recently put one in my son's home-built system and it runs everything really well. Great clarity, very responsive, quiet. It doesn't have problems running video and games for hours on end though it can get a bit warm if you don't have a well ventilated case. Luckily we do.However, this is now an obsolete card. The much more powerful GeForce 9500 1GB is right now selling for less than the 8500GT so unless your computer is older and has a compatibility issue with it, the 9500 is currently the ""value for performance"" card to get."
2,Worked well for a while,"This card worked well for quite a while, but eventually, the fan failed which caused the board to overheat and die. I keep my computer VERY clean, so dirt should not have been the culprit. I clean it regularly with compressed air.I replaced it with a fanless ATI HD4350 and have not looked back. My new card works much better, and was cheaper."
5,love it.,"what else can i say about this product it works great, han an affordable price, and i like what this card has done for my pc."
5,more for less money,"i'm very happpy, even more than with my ATI Radeon X1600 Pro 512 MB PCI Express. The best thing in this pny verto video card, is the price, and the option of precise resolution setup."
5,Economical and efficient,Best bang for the buck. Inexpensive and handles very well. No problems that I have had whatsoever and even overclocks nicely.
5,Graphic Card,"PNY Verto GeForce 8500GT 512MB Video Cardwith the low price at Amazon, you can't go wrong with a 512MB Nvidia card.Low price, uses DX10, easy to install, plenty of memory, great graphics."
1,The noise of the fan is unbearable,"It was fine at first, but after a few months the noise is so loud I was losing my mind. I had to take it out and throw it away. Lost money. Avoid this card."
3,Plays all the games but noisy fan!,"My only complaint is that the fan can sometimes start to make a loud buzzing sound. I have a Dell Dimension 9100 so it's rather easy for me to open it and tap on the fan, and surprisingly it isn't chronic so I haven't yet thrown it out the window.Plays all the games though. Was really inexpensive... for about $50 it does the job."
5,Pleased,"This card is great product and at a good price ,thinking of buying another for the SLI experience"
4,Outstanding,Got the card. Inserted into my Compaq Presario 2008 model. Vista recognized it automatically. Did not use windows setup. Downloaded drivers from nVidea & installed. Been kicking butt ever since. No problems what so ever with Compaq system. Works well with Xonar Dx sound card on intel boards. You may want to invest in a 400+ power supply box as these devices generate heat and demand more power to run.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"BLADES WERE OBVIOUSLY OLD, USED, RECONDITIONED BLADES. I THOUGHT THE PACKAGING LOOKED FAKE WHEN I SAW IT, AND WHEN I TRIED THE BLADES I KNEW I'D BEEN CHEATED. SAME THING HAPPENED A FEW YRS AGO ON E-BAY. YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE TO BE HONEST ANYMORE...."
1,Use-less crap,The blades pull your hair more than they cut it. They cause irritation and hurt when using. Now I am stuck with 40 blades worth nothing.
1,"The real thing is fantastic, but the fakes are awful","These razor blades are really great but really expensive too. So, I shopped online for""cheaper"" ones. What I got were counterfeit copies that were very hard on my face with lotsof cuts.Fortunately, the seller didn't know they were fakes and promptly refunded my money."
1,Not Good Quality,Gillette Mach 3 Turbo Refills - 40 CartridgesThese are NASTY. Pulled skin and irritated face. Can't be factory firsts.
3,venetian plaster,the best synthetic plaster in the area of new york city you can make a very reflective marble like surface with this materialI would say not for do it yourself doers and if you do it yourself practice a lot on a wallboard before you try on a wall.if you burnish it over too wet spots it may crack or peel so the trick is to go in thin layers so it can dry fast and uniformlyhave fun with it.
5,"Just discovered, now my favorite Dancing Cat album","I discovered Dancing Cat albums when I was stationed in Hawaii in the 1990s.A few years later, when I created a ""Deserted Island Music"" website to share my love of music, Dancing Cat albums were on the list: Ozzie Kotani, George Kuo, Ray Kane, Sonny Chillingworth....This album has become my favorite of them all.It shouldn't have taken so long. It's ten years since this album came out. I had Led Kaapana's ""...and Friends"" album, and it was also wonderful, but I'd never heard of Brozman. Then Netflix recommended a video of Brozman. While the concert left me cold, there was no doubt about Brozman's immense talent.I've made a copy of this CD for the work commute, where it's played over and over, each time some new delight discovered.It's been a few years (2006, Harris-Knopfler) since music has so stirred me up. Am happy to see music can still get me excited."
4,excellent book,"it is a very good daily devotional, Eugene Peterson puts a lot of thought in to the daily devotionals, it is worth reading."
5,Great Meetings is a Great Resource,"For the past 22 years, I've been designing and conducting experiential training events. I have also been teaching and coaching others in this work. I have found Great Meetings!to be an invaluable resource. Dee Kelsey and Pam Plumb have managed to present the most important concepts of facilitation in a straight-forward and engaging way. I frequently turn to Great Meetings! as a reference in my work, I recommend it to others, and I give it as a gift to colleagues and friends. Great Meetings! filled a void and I am grateful to the authors for knowing it was neededand for bringing it into being."
3,Facilitation,I am a facilitator. This book was used as a text/guide in a course to teach people just learning facilitation. It's just fine. Not really terrific or particularly poor but perfectly adequate.
4,Help for Meetings,"A good read for those looking who want to go get more results out of meetings. If anyone is leading your meetings and is doing it in a dysfunctional way, give this to them. It will help. The bookLeading Groups to Solutions: A Practical Guide for Facilitators and Team Membersis also good to give to those who need help. It is a little different this one, but helps with groups and team meetings. Overall a good solid 4 stars!"
4,It truly was a memorable dinner.,"I was happy to find my four dinner guests at the door so early, all huddled together, dressed alike (to wonder who had planned that one!). They didn't speak a word, although one tried to cut off my thumb after I attempted to remove his rubberband. The manners of some...The pork chops were a little dry, but other than that, all five of us enjoyed our dinner."
1,not worth the wait,"After finally recieving this product,it dosn't work! and after contacting seller still have yet to recieve replacement or anything else. I don't advise buying from this seller!!"
5,"Finally, I get it!","It's about...time! Someone has finally put object-oriented programming into language that I can understand! It's not dumbed down by any standard, but easy-to-read, easy-to-understand, and and incredibly informative. I don't think I've seen any other books by this author, (maybe it's her first), but I sure would like to. A+++"
3,Good text but the,"Well the book isn't bad at all, the code samples aren't explained enought, some OOP basics are there but I would recommend other readings. For sure this isn't a book for beginners, you must have some background in OOP programming to get it. Mainly the Interface chapters, very confusing."
1,Very disappointed,"Very ambiguous and confusing in places. Heck, page 1, paragraph 1, the author decided to use an example to illustrate what a ""class"" (as in the blueprint for objects) is. Unfortunately, she chooses to use a college registration illustration, which includes ""classes"" (as in a college classroom). She then goes on to talk about a ""class"" a dozen times or more, quite often not being clear if she's talking about the OOP class or the thing the student goes to. Does ""class registration"" mean when the student goes to sign-up for his class, or when you're initializing the class to create student objects in your code? Again, all this is page 1, paragraph 1.More examples of confusion and ambiguity show up frequently. I am disappointed."
5,An organized approach to gaining a foundation upon which to learn VB.net,"I'm 53 years old and have been programming for 40 years. I picked up Robin's book about 2 years ago. Prior to that my most recent experience was with VBA and Access Basic. 15 years before that I had done some mainframe work in PL/I, SAS and older Basics. I had never done any OOP and my UI was limited to VBA.This book is an excellent tutorial. You can go through it, chapter by chapter. Don't use the CD -- type in the examples and then alter them little by little and you will learn how this stuff works. I think that if had started with a larger book I would have spent too much time wandering about, and would not have gained a solid foundation.I hope Robin decides to write a 2005 version."
4,Good could be better,"Overall a good book.I like the hands-on style of explaining things. The author does not give you wooden definitions but talks in a practical manner. e.g. ""A constructor is block of code that executes when you use the new keyword to create an instance of a class."" I ve never read such a clear and to the point explanation of a constructor before. The text is full of tips and established practices that I found particularly helpfull.The negative is that lots of things are not explained. The logic and whys behind some of the code are simply missing, which is a shame since the author is a skillful one. This book could easily get a 5 star rating if it were not for this. I d actually give 3,5.I haven't read other books on OOP and .NET but I think this one is worth its money."
1,Not worth the Time,"As an experienced VB6 programmer, I found this book rather [useless], the examples primitive and not worth my time. And, occassionally, the code as written in the book would not compile."
1,OOP with Microsoft Visual Basic .NET and Microsoft Visual C#,I was so disappointed. This book will get you NOWHERE.Simply waste of money.
1,A Fantasy Bait-and-Switch,"A one-trick pony of a novel, this book is a simple transposition of the American Civil War to a fantasy setting. Calvalry ride unicorns, the cannons become wizzards, trains become flying crapets, etc. Now, while this may sound interesting, the novel in execution is as dry, boring, overblown, and obsessed with pointless uninteristing detail as the most crustily written Civil War history.If you've got the PhD in history with specialization in the Civil War required to get all the in-jokes, then this book might be for you. Beyond that, Turtledove, for all his usual creativity and flair, offers absolutely nothing."
2,A Blonde Joke Overdone,"I consider myself a big fan of Harry Turtledove's and have all of his books in my library, using some in my teaching. The first in this series, Sentry Peak, was more humorous than serious and I did enjoy it to a point. In a review of that book I described it as the longest blonde joke I had ever read, a good satire. However Marching Through Peachtree belabors the point without the fun and the author even has to explain at the end how he used Sherman's march through Georgia during the Civil War to make up his alternate world plot. Really unforgivable is a slapstick scene from Gone With The Wind which in itself has been considered by some as an alternate history. I will still buy everything Turtledove writes and hope it will have better results for me as a reader and a teacher."
3,Good but not great,"The second in a seres analogous to the American Civil War, where the North of Detina rebels against King Avram for trying to emancipate the blond serfs. Fantasy solutions replace technology, such as magic carpets replacing railways. This book covers the southern army's fight north to cut the north in two.I found this book to be more entertaining than the first one in the seres,Sentry Peak, as if Turtledove had gotten a better feel for his characters. However, this is not one of his best stories, as the story never really takes off. I recommend this book to Turtledove completests, but not to someone who is looking for a place to start Turtledove."
2,Not up to Par,"This re-telling of Sherman's Georgia campaign is not up to Harry's usual high standards. His use of the real characters middle names,I.E. Lt Gen Bell for John Bell Hood, and cute substitutions for places, I.E. ""Fat Mama"" for Cass,GA do not carry the story. One would do better to read the 3rd Vol of Shelby Foote's Civil War History."
5,Out of this world,"Great music! AN epic album, best listened to in its entirety. Space Walk is a timeless masterpiece. I would love to see this with some kind of laser light show."
1,How about some samples?,Put some samples up there for us good little consumers to listen to. Obviously this album has enough interest from people to justify at least the first five songs. Are ya lazy or what?
4,(ORB + Cafe del Mar CD + Layo & Bushwacka) /3,"To me, this CD is like a newer version of the ORB with a bit of house music essence and ibiza taste. For some reason, though, I feel this CD is more of a hiking type, rather than the beach mood...I like it very much, and I still listen to it after several times.To be really honest, I think nowadays, it is getting quite hard to listen through an artist's album. After a few tracks, you get the idea how the whole thing goes. You've been there, done that, seen them, listened to them.But this album has passed that criteria.Smoothly and carefully arranged with decent sound quality.Quite nice to listen to it, after some hard night out, or getting up and having a nice cup of coffee in a sunny Sunday morning.I estimate that I can listen ot it six months more, if not 10."
3,Could this album sound the way that prozac feels?,"On the surface Lost Horizons has the blase character of an overproduced glee club medley. While I have never used Prozac, I suspect that the effervescent orchestration and utopian vocalizations found here are morally equivalent to the preternatural emotional equilibrium that the drug is purported to provide. Still, it is clear that something darker is probing the periphery. I mean, nobody can be this upbeat, and no drug can fend off every last tendril of panic, right?Many reviewers find Lost Horizons impossible to resist. Despite the palpable edginess of the album, I cannot endure its ceaseless melodic boosterism."
4,Excellent Silver Product!,"I love the Aurthur Court Grape Collection; it is as ornate as you see in the pictures. I had expected this product to be a little larger than what it is, however, it is still a reasonable size for a spoon rest."
5,Count St Germain remains one of the best vampires in fiction,"After more than a dozen novels of the life and times of Count Saint Germain, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro still manages to make his story both relevant and spellbinding. Her beautifully written stories are masterpieces of historical fiction -- being meticulously researched and finely told -- and I never fail to learn something new about the world, and about St. Germain.In this newest adventure, the Count is a trader in Yang-Chau (Shanghai) China in 535 A.D., a year known as the Year of the Dark Sun. It was named this due to the eruption of Krakatoa -- a rare, once in a millenium scale event that blocked the sun to varying degrees around the world, and caused starvation and panic where ever the clouds of ash prevailed. A fine novel, full of energized plotlines and well rounded characters. Highly recommended."
1,There were some scenes .....,that I found interesting but on the whole this is a book I should have returned....It's probably a high for those of us that into submission to the point of mental not physical pain .....Its not the humiliation of the young hero of this book that bother me I guess its his stupidity ....Who says a sadist would never hit a masochist ... this is abt as close as it gets
3,Pseudo-porn,"Maybe I thought this was a more clinical type book, but it actually is quite pornographic. If that's your cup of tea, then go for it. In that way, it's well written. I think it's just that I was expecting something else so I was disappointed."
4,Good action adventure - a heroine one can identify with.,"By the Sword has a strong heroine who carves her own way in a world that would rather gently shelter and support her - if she would let it. Anyone who has ever chafed at the restrictive roles society tries to place over us will empathise with this lady! This is a action adventure tale with a strong, smart and sexy lady who keeps rolling with the punches, and believe me, the punches never seem to stop"
5,I loved this book!!!!,"I love all of Lackey's books but it was Kerowyn's character that really made this book worth wild. When everyone in her keep was wounded she went out to try to save her brothers bride, not for honor or bravery but because the girl needed help. I'd already read the Tarma & Kethery books and was looking forward to more books with Need in them. I can't say how much I enjoyed this book."
5,Great,This was the first Mercedes Lackey book I'd read that she hadn't co-authored with one of my other favourite authors. It is a wonderful read and I recommend it. It hooked me on the Heralds of Valdemar and I've read all of those books that I've been able to get my hands on!
5,Loved it,"Merecedes gives us a new spell binding book of a girl out of place in her fathers home.When her family is slaughtered and her brothers fiance is taken, she goes on a ride that begins her destiny. Training with Tamra and warle she goes to seek her fortuned in the mercenary bussiness. Absolutely loved it. Spell binding and captavating. Could not have done better."
3,I guess I'm alone in thinking this is not her best work....,"I absolutely loved the first two books in this cycle, ""Oathbound"" and ""Oathbreakers,"" but I thought this one fell far short of the mark. Endlessly repetitious and filled with obvious observations, I found myself impatiently skimming through just to get to the end to discover how it all turns out, without getting bogged down in repetitive detail. I never really bought the central love story and the opportunities to deal with Kero's hesitancy about her magic were not explored nearly as much as they could have been.I see from the other reviews that I am obviously in the minority here, so take my review with a grain of salt. I just wanted someone to put out a warning that this may not be up to the Lackey standards you expect. My advice is to go back and read the first two books instead."
4,A good Valdemar novel,"Fans of Tarma and Kethry will enjoy this. (I have not been able to 'get into' their stories.) It is an enjoyable read. I was engrossed in it, but at the same time, I didn't like it as much as the Herald-Mage trilogy.It is definitely worth reading for any Misty fan."
2,"Another dismal attempt to make fantasy more ""correct. . . ""","It is fairly well written. . . but suffers from the syndrome inflicting modern fantasy that makes them look for a politically correct ""lesson"" to teach us all. If you like to be hectored by a writer, then by all means buy this book. If you think women could survive in a sword fighting culture as warriors for very long, then by all means get this book. Otherwise, reread ""Lord of the Rings."""
5,A Book On Watt Pottery,This book is very informative. It gives one an idea of the value of a particular piece of Watt Ware. It lists all the different styles that were created. I keep it in my car in case I find a piece of Watt Ware in an antique store and wish to see how the store's price compares with the value listed in the book. It is a very good resource to have on hand.
5,Great tie for bicycle fans!,"This 100% silk tie is great for bicycle fans. The pattern is full of colors, making it easy for even a color-blind guy to match a shirt and pants. The quality is good, as well. The background color is navy blue."
3,Looking for mood music?,Not exactly what I wanted but it is fine for setting a Hawaiian mood for parties for 2. Pretend you're on the beach at Waikiki with the sun shining down.
4,New bio of Sheridan,"Drake delivers a well-written biography of Sheridan using family information as well as primary source information. The book encompasses Sheridan's life, not just his military career. Includes his efforts in preserving Yellowstone and establishing our national park system. GREAT READ!"
2,Needed help,"I sat through the whole movie though there were a number of times my mind just wandered without missing anything. Battle scenes were OK, but the direction wasn't tight and the film sorely needed a good editor. A decent effort, but in addition to some of the dialogue not being able to be heard (as noted in another review) there were also scenes that went too long and honestly the ""900"" only went into action the last 30 minutes or so of the movie. With editing and clearer audio, it would have been a four star in my view. I'd say a potentially great story that took too long to tell here."
4,Great movie,"sword fights and hand to hand combat. It's not a drone flying overhead dropping a bomb that the pilot is flying from a thousand miles away, this is face to face ruthless war. It both demonizes the art of war and yet brings a tone of nostalgia. The sword has been used for war for Thousands of years and it's only recently that projectiles have been used to cause harm. Anybody can pull a trigger but not everybody can wield a sword."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Save your money. Very, very cheap production. Fighting scene are terrible, they're movement are like numbered. A lot of scene showing the feet of horses running to show a lot of horsemen, it's not. Its the worst movie I ever bought."
2,New Zealand Flag,"It is a nice flag. The reason why I bought the flag was due to the logo and that is said ""New Zealand,"" yet it dosent say New Zealand. It just has the feather on it. Disappointed that the name is missing."
5,Great music fom the Prima,Every track on it has 1st rate playing by Roby and accompanyment by his group - his pianist in particular.
2,Book is fine but you need to have a source of jobs.,"The book may tell you how to become a security guard but it does not point to available jobs. There are many websites that claim to offer jobs but it often remains difficult. At, http://www.physicalsecuritycrossing.com you can find jobs dealing with this specific career field. At http://www.physicalsecuritycrossing.com/ , they only have jobs from employer websites and offer far more jobs than other job boards."
3,Only good when stacked,"""This is the kind of supplement that was made to be stacked.""quoted from Taylor CoelamnI agree to this as I had two bottles that I have used. The first bottle I took alone and only noticed a mild increase in sleeping and it seemed to have had me in a better mood through out the time on product. The second time I used the product at least 3 months after my first try as I forgot I had purchased two bottles. This time I stacked with xtest and I'm not sure if was just the fact of these two products working in perfect synergy, but I lost some body fat, improved sleeping patterns and had a nice re-comp. So I would agree with Taylor as I didn't notice much until I stacked it.Would I purchase again or suggest to a friend?No I absolutely would not, I've tried all of this companies products and I'm not impressed at all please just shop around as these products seem under-dosed or mild. I'm 510 190 pounds just in case your wondering."
1,Doesn't Work,"Not sure if I just got a bad copy or not. It installs fine, but when I try to use the character generator, it crashes. I tried on a laptop running Vista and a desktop running Windows 7. The only other review was from 2010, so even though this was manufactured in the early 2000's didn't think there would be any problem with newer windows versions. If someone knows of a solution, please let me know :)"
3,Disappointed :( SO SMALL,"When I ordered this I really expected it to be big like the other Bruder toys. It's VERY small. And in my opinion, for the price, it's NOT worth it. It's a great idea and would have been wonderful if it was at least twice the size."
5,Just like I was there,"My mother grew up in South Dakota and the stories she told me about the little school house, walking to school, weather, the people, and more are recreated in this wonderful book. It feels like I get to relive a part of her life. It is well written and the author pulled me into the story making wish I didn't have to close the cover."
1,Dear God Get this Woman an Editor,"I'm sure much of the content is very helpful, but it's hard to fully get the effect because the book is so unprofessionally put together I was astounded. It's not only highly disorganized (no chapters -- just one loooooong one with strange subheads which are designed to help people find the content they need but they don't make sense). The index doesn't match the pages where the content is. No joke, every single page is riddled with typos -- sentences filled with gibberish words, sentences which don't finish, misspelled words....aaagh what a mess. It looks like someone's first rough manuscript and no one bothered to read it and fix the typos. If she wants people to take this book seriously, she really needs to clean it up."
2,One good band,"To me the 90's were deffined by one simple name... Nirvana. Dont get me wrong. The 90's had some great bands (REM, Chilie Peppers, Pearl Jam). But still, you cannot deeny how much Nirvana carried the music world in the 90's. When Cobain commited suicide in '94 (RIP), the music world was lost,and was carried by only 2 or 3 good bands."
3,A Struggle for the Constitution,"Brennan vs. Rehnquist is a very interesting study into the careers of two justices who, for the eighteen years during which they each served on the Supreme Court, presenting two very differing views of the Constitution, battled over the meaning of that most essential document. Peter Irons, at the start, admits his preference for the Brennan approach. Despite this, he does a fairly good job at presenting both sides fairly evenhandedly. The reading of this book does convey an understanding of two approaches to the interpretation of the Constitution which underlie many of the cases which we see reported in the press. Irons' writing style bridges the gap between the needs of the lawyer and those of the layman. While presenting the arguments with sufficient depth to interest the lawyer, he avoids the technical jargon which could bore the lay reader."
3,"Great premise, but fails to deliver insight","In the 1970's and 1980's, an epic battle took place in the United States of America. Although it was not often recognized, the ideological disputes between the judicial conversatives of the Supreme Court (led by Justice William Rehnquist)and the judicial activists (led by William Brennan) profoundly shaped American society. In retrospect, the Brennan camp did a healthy job of holding off the conservatives for a number of years. Individual liberties expanded at the expense of governmental control. Professor Irons does a good job of setting forth the battleground and tallying the score for each camp. What he fails to do, however, is provide the reader with any insight to the nuances of the battle. I would have been happier with this book if it would have attempted to provide some additional legal analysis that described how the Brennan v. Rehnquist battle established new ways of thinking about Constitututional law."
2,Left it for the next campers,"So, I figured I'd give this a shot and I bought one. I was a little disappointed at the size, but I'll accept that it says the size and I could have payed closer attention to that. It also didn't do well with the fire. One side started to melt fairly quickly after starting using it. I definitely would not recommend this. Pay the extra $$ and get something that will work better."
3,Good product but short,It's very sturdy but it's hard to put it over a fire to cook with because it's so short. The wire mesh is nice.
5,Brilliant camp stove for small group up to 6 people.,"This is not the biggest campfire grill, but it's perfect for a small group and the legs fold down flat to make it easier to store and to transport to your campsite too. It is a little heavy, but a quality grill should be. It's easy to clean and sits nicely over a campfire - I don't know how long it will hold up to camping trips, but so far, so good!"
4,A Classic English Village Mystery!,"Ann Granger's Markby and Mitchell series is a very satisfying one. She has the genre of the English village mystery down to a tee. In this book Meredith and Alan are on vacation in the Cotswolds, and even there they can't get away from strange happenings and murder. They discover a witch's coven, the village Romeo and even the village young man who has a lot of psychological problems. I really enjoy the way the Meredith and Alan's relationship is progressing. They are are good complimentary sleuthing duo. I enjoy a book that takes me to where the book is written, and one that feels like an old friend. Granger's series is this for me. Once I begin one of her books, I'm taken away from everything else in my life."
1,description,who ever is selling this item needs to learn about cars because this UNIVERSAL wiring harness does not fit my 2002 import car stereo.
1,Mixed Reviews,"After reading the reviews on this book, both negative and positive I decided to head out to Barnes and Noble and take a look myself. I spent three hours reading through this book at the cafe before finally giving up from frustration. I can see what other reviewers mean when they say this book is informative and full of information, but I approached the book looking for hoodoo specific knowledge and found little to none. I do agree with the reviewer who wrote in saying that Hyatts and Yronwodes works are far better when one is looking for hoodoo, where this book falls short, however if you are looking for a collection of information, not hoodoo specific, then this is probably a good book for you, unfortuenantly I didnt find it necessary to buy."
1,Yeah Right.,"Sorry Ms Bird, this is just as bad as your first ""book"". Seems like you are just like Ray Malbrough, Had a contract with Llewyllyn and decided to publish more nonsense. Like I said, you want hoodoo, read Yronwode."
5,The beauty in all religions...,"I have really enjoyed reading ""Four Seasons of Mojo"" by Stephanie Rose Bird. She is able to share her unique knowledge of her chosen path while showing me the beauty of a different tradition. As a Universalist, the book gives me the opportunity to stay open to many different paths and walks of life as well as being able to experience many different cultural expression in the African Tradition. Everyone has their own chosen paths, traditions, and beliefs; Stephanie Rose Bird's brand of Hoodoo is just one of many paths traveled in the world today. All knowledge is power, there is no right or wrong. My students are now reading her book, and they are really enjoying the information presented in her book. I found this book extremely helpful in my spiritual journey."
3,nice book,It was okay for me . I thought it was going to show hoodoo spells but i misread the description. Over all it is an okay book for wanting to know how to cook and clean and create things natuarlly for your house hold.
2,Don't use in stainless steel dishwasher,"This product actually worked pretty well at cleaning the inside of my dishwasher. The water we had was pretty hard. It just caked the dishes. After using Glisten, my glassware that looked so dingy once again sparkled.The problem I had was it instructs us not to use this product on stainless steel utensils. Well, my dishwasher was stainless steel inside. I ran the Glisten anyway, and although it was very clean afterwards, it looked like it was also beginning to rust. The rust streak ran from the detergent cup. It wasn't extremely bad, but it discolored my dishwasher and I didn't want to make it worse, so I had to stop using Glisten."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,"The Story of Us is one of those movies, where the title tells you everything you need to know about the movie. I am by no means a fan of these sappy romantic comedies, however I do sometimes go out of my comfort zone for a movie that has a great cast. Bruce Willis is easily one of my favorite actors and having seen almost everything he's done, I rented this. What can I say? It's the story about meeting your soul mate, getting married, and the ups & downs associated with family life. There are no surprises and there is nothing special here. I didn't find the movie particularly funny and even at 96 minutes, it still felt very long. If you're into these sappy romantic comedies, you might like it, you might not. I was just indifferent too it. The Story of Us didn't impress me, but I didn't hate it either."
2,Had potential but.......,If they took out all of the bad language and sexual discussion and content from the movie it would only be about 30 minutes long..........had a lot of potential in the plot but was overkill and not something I would watch with any of my friends.......
3,"ummm, well its a matter of opinion really...........","I have to say, i found his brand of humor to be rather crude and silly, obviously i am in the minority here. But somehow i just couldn't ""get"" this kind of humor, where he just goes about cussing and cussing and makes rather dated and stale jokes.I have to say, Jim Norton's description of this buy being a ""Tall Dwarf"" is funny as hell, he should have added 'pathetic jerk' as well.imo, a very generous 3 stars"
1,The worst.,"It must take real talent to stand up on a stage and curse. That is all that you will get here. Not funny at all. A waste of not only money, but time."
1,Is it real???,"Last year I bought the Eau de Toilette Rive Gauche and like it a lot! Thus I decided to buy a 2-Piece set of Rive Gauche Eau de Toilette and Vitalazing Body Emulsion through Amazon. What I received does not at all smell like the one I had, and glasses' cover don't look like the real thing. The only reason i din't return it was because I was out of the country when I found out the ""mistake""."
4,Get Me to the Race Alive,"RAT RACE is the second Dick Frances that explores his love of flying light aircraft. Matt Shore has a air taxi service which he uses to transport race goers and jockeys from track to track. He has his competetors in this lucrative business who will stop at nothing to put Matt out of business.Bombs and evil have become more sophisticated since this 1971 entry in mystery fiction, but that doesn't cloud the enjoyment of Matt's romance with the sister of a champion jockey, his resourcefullness in solving his problems and the excitement of his efforts to guide a cripple plane to a safe a landing.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
5,Great Shoes!,I really enjoy these shoes! I made sure to get wide and they wear very well. The heel is perfect for all day at the office and the neutral color is perfect for many wardrobe combinations. I love the detailing by the peep-toe as it adds just enough flair.
4,Cool ring,I love this ring but i noticed that it has started turning a rust color. not like rust on the side of a car like a tarnished look. not sure if that is from washing my hands with it on.
5,great product,"This irrigator is a great product. Its surprisingly strong and a great thing to have around as an oral hygiene aid. Helps get the particles out that you have brushed out. I would recommend it, especially those people with ""food traps"" in their mouths, or braces."
4,Panasonic EW1270AC,"Works as advertised. It runs out of water quickly, but it is easy to refill. I use rechargeable batteries because it would cost too much money to use regular AA batteries. It works fine with NiMH batteries."
4,good one,"so i wanted to get one of those portable picker, and my dentist said i should get the waterpik . but after reading lots of reviews i decided to get the Panasonic. sine i never used the other one i can only write my experience with his one.the picker works grate. it does the job very good, and i can see all the food that left in between my teeth going down the drain every time i use it. i just wish it would had more power. overall i am very satisfied."
2,"Just too weak, there are better options","their are 2 choices for the rechargables 1. this one2. the WATERPIK ""Ultra""the Panasonic has a 10x better battery because it holds a charge for much longer. If you buy the Ultra by WATERPIK you can rely on one thing if you use it continually, replacing it every 3-6 months. Too bad the Panasonic is so much weaker than the WATERPIK brand rival. The answer is there is no good answer for rechargables. I went with the best choice I believe which isShowerBreeze w/ 3' hose Oral IrrigatorMore powerful, no dead battrries EEVVEERR, and best of all no freakin mess. NO CONTEST."
1,Don't buy this!,"In short, it's a toy... with a water stream that's weak. It was a great disappointment."
1,panasonia oral irrigator,This product is not nearly as good as the Waterpic which I have in another bathroom of my house.
4,Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator,"Does a good job, but you need to hurry, as the water reservoir holds just enough to complete the cleaning process. Don't expect the power of a non-portable unit. Convenient for traveling."
2,This is one messy little apparatus!!,"I can't help but laugh hysterically everytime I try to use this with my 10 year old. First of all, you MUST be directly over the sink when planning on using this irrigator. Second, plan on gagging over the amount of water that is shot into your mouth. Third, you WILL be wiping down your entire bathroom after the shower that takes place from the water splattering out of your mouth. WOW!! Now the good news is that it does in fact work. We bought this for our 10 year old that needed something to help clear out his orthodontic equipement and it has helped. But WHOA it is a mess! Beware..."
2,Better Than Nothing,Not much water. Difficlult to navigate in my mouth. Water Pic is much better but Water Pic's quality has declined a lot over the years and they don't offer much repair on many units.
2,refills,Works okay but needs a refill to complete the job. Needs a speed control. It is bulky to handle and difficult to turn off while manipulating. Would not buy another one.
3,"not the best, but serves a purpose","I bought this at the same time as the waterpik ultra. I love the waterpik, but am not such a big fan of this item. It is a bit awkward to handle. It doesn't seem as sanitary, since the water canal doesn't dry out all that easily, and it isn't quite powerful enough. My mouth just doesn't seem as clean afterwards.That being said, it is probably not a bad choice for travel, when you don't want to lug around your waterpik. I have braces, so need to get the gums and between my teeth clean, so I will use it for this purpose. I definitely would not use it to replace flossing, more as an addition to flossing.It is easy to fill, and would be useful in a bathroom that doesn't have an outlet available (i.e. my parents have such an ancient bathroom that it does not).Overall, I can only give it a fair rating. I am not overly impressed."
5,Good buy.,"I like this oral irrigator. It doesn't hold much water (you have to fill it up at least two times during use), but it really does the job, it's easy to use and I can be quick about it."
4,reliable for travel,"I just got back from 16 days in the UK. I bought the Panasonic EW 1270 for this and other upcoming trips after reading the reviews and deciding against the Waterpik portable (because of reports of battery usage).I never had to change batteries during my trip. This product was completely reliable and performed well. Yes, you will run out of water if you are not quick and what's the big deal about filling the well again? One point: the pictures are taken from a side angle so it looks smaller than it really is - 2.5x6x1.5 or so. It also has enough weight to make a backpacker think twice about carrying it on a trek.If you are looking for something to take with you traveling, I recommend this item. - Kathy in CA"
2,Ok but not great,"Cannot say that this is great, the water pressure is weak and the tank too small and after taking it with me on a few trips, it stopped working."
4,wonderful portability,"Have three of three in the last 2 years; It is great (but one has to keep fresh batteries in it,obviously,or the water pressure can be limited after the battery powers down); I wish there were some method to chemically clean the inside as depending on the state of ones water (I live in NYC where the water is Good, actually) but probably with a fair amount of chem's and I suspect ,over a shorter period than I would like-that the Interior gets a bit of'brown stuff' (don't ask me what it is) but to try to avoid this, I leave the little cover open and this helps dry out the inner water chamber and its parts.I have NEVER had a good experience with the corded Water Pics which are awkward and so on so THIS IS IT.Good product, but one has to dispose of it when the interior (which I'd love to figure out how to effectivey clean!)"
4,Very good,I am very happy with this product. It is small and easy to travel with. It works well. You do need to fill it twice to get a good cleaning job.
4,After first use..........,"After the first use with the Panasonic Oral Irrigator my mouth felt refreshed! I used this before going to bed and my mouth still felt completely clean when I woke up. It is very powerfull, but the water doesn't last very long. The Panasonice Oral Irrigator can be compacted down and stored easily.Only downfall......this must be used in the shower or outside. It WILL MAKE A COMPLETE MESS. I will use mine in the shower from now on. My mirror got a nice bath afterwards!"
5,I love it!,"It's very easy to use and so far I haven't had to change a battery. It is very gentle but removes food between brushings. I use in between brushings and flossings, and it just feels good!"
4,Very handy,I've only had a chance to use this a few times. It's a little messy (as all of them are). It's very handy and portable. It doesn't take up much room and it's easy to use. I like it so far.
4,Good for travelling,"Clever design makes for a compact unit which worked well for me on a recent two week trip.It would be nice if a second head could be included since I travel with my wife, and we had to keep cleaning the head for individual use.Also there is no pressure regulator. The pressure on full battery charge too strong for us. I managed to reduce this by using slightly used batteries.I would buy this unit again."
4,Panasonic Oral Irrigator,"Bought this to replace a bigger oral irrigator that had to be plugged in. This is alot easier to use and clean. The only thing, I usually have to fill it twice when using. Would buy it again."
3,Rate Average,"Not as powerful as a plug-in electric. Must be filled several times each use, an inconvenience. Water comes out freely in other ways than through spout. Cover of fill hole keeps popping off, a nuisance. Cannot rate it against other battery operated units, as only used a plug-in electric before."
3,Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator,"For the price it does a very good job. It is a bit tedious to have to refill water after about 30-40 seconds, but not having to have a cumbersome unit makes it worth the hassle. Does a good job cleaning and massaging - definitely good for travel."
3,"Not that helpful, for non brace user.","Wish I got his when I wear braces a decade ago.. I don't think is that helpful for non braces user.. Floss does better job overall over this, mainly because the hardest part of the teeth only floss can take it out not this, it doesn't had enought water so you had to refill water often. It might hard to use it, travel is good but careful not make a mess lol"
4,portabale water pik,"I purchased this Panasonic unit to take on an upcoming trip - versus lugging the large water pik I use in my bathroom. I have only used it a few times but it appears it will certainly do the job. Filling with water is an extra step but due to it's compactness and light weight it certainly ""outweighs"" taking the large version. Yes, so far I like it for a trip or maybe staying overnight at a friends house. I would recommend it.George Morrison"
4,Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator,"THIS ITEM IS WORKING GOOD, BUT YOU NEED TO FILLED WATER SO SOON BECAUSE THE RESERVOIR IS SMALL AND ALSO THE TIP IS MOVING KEEP MOVING WHILE USING IT.BUT ITS CONVENIENT TO USE WHEN YOU TRAVEL.I RATE IT NO 4.DANNY CRUZ OF CALIFORNIA, USA"
2,panasonic EW1270AC irrigator,"I have used this product on my vacation in Egypt for two weeks, it work great, power is adequated with rechargeable batteries, I wish the unit should came with two picks, one pick is wrong for over all classes, indicated so cheap in everyway, I gave it 2 stars because for that, if come with 2-picks, it should be in the 4-stars categories, because for travel peoples normally at least two peoples involved. Panasonic, don't be so cheap! show some class!!"
2,"Good, when it works....","I purchased the Panasonic irrigator 2 years ago. It is a good product when it works. Mine stopped working some months ago. I could not repair it. As I needed it urgently, I now bought a second one - as I found no alternative. Per se not a good policy, I admit."
5,Wonderful,"Great product! Works wonderfully. Just enough water to do your whole mouth. Terrific size, takes up hardly any space."
4,Nice design,"I love the size and the design. It works very well. The directions say not to use with mouthwash. Many of the reviews recommended rechargeable batteries, so that's what I started with."
2,Panasonic Oral Irrigator - 1 year and going strong,"I bought the Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator about a year ago. Some have expressed concern about the battery life, but if you use rechargable NiMH batteries, you'll get lots of use before you need to recharge them.I have fairly large spaces between my teeth due to gum disease, and while I like to floss, it is just too inefficient to floss after every meal. And with the spaces like that, there are lots of places for food to hide. With the Oral Irrigator, its a breeze to clean up between the teeth. Gets the darn food out of there.I have tried things like the water pik, and its too harsh. Besides that, the cord presents a hassle.The Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator does a great job, and eliminates the hassle you'd have with a water pik.I waited a year before writing this, and it goes to show, that I really like the product. If it didn't cut it, I wouldn't still be pleased with it a year later."
5,compact oral care,"Perfect travel companion, lightweight and has good cleaning power. Highly recommended for use.Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator"
3,"Acceptable, but...","This one is acceptable, however, do not buy it if you are expecting it to be anything like a trip to the dentist. It is not powerful enough for my tastes. Expect to fill it a few times before you finish."
2,A disappointment!,"We have had many Panasonic products over the years and have always been pleased with their performance. This one falls way short. It works pretty well with fresh batteries for the first 3-4 cleanings, but the power diminishes greatly thereafter. Taken on a trip of several days I must carry a supply of batteries to keep it going with any effectiveness. I would like to return it if it isn't too late."
3,"Works better than a Water Pik, but...",The Panasonic Oral Irrigator performs better and is easier to use than the Water Pik. The problem is that the rubber gasket in the water chambershredded after about a month and a half and now leaks when it is full. I may have to replace it soon.
4,A Happy Consumer,"This product gets an A+. Found it to be very portable for travel. Tank wholes plenty of water. Battery seem to last, been on 3 trips an still same battery. Easy to handle. Although i tried to think of something negitive, I just cant find anything. Worth every Dollar."
3,"emphasis on ""travel""","This unit is good for traveling, but not for home use. The whole unit is what you see here -- the resevoir is the blue bottom. The white top houses the battery. Yes, it is battery operated and the resevoir is very small. I returned it to get the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet instead."
4,water pick review,"I bought this for my son after he got his braces. He loves it.It's easy to use, compact enough to fit in the small cabinet in his bathroom and fits in a Zip-Loc bag for traveling.I have had 3 of the portable Water-Pik brand versions but all lost battery power in only a few months even though they were supposed to be rechargeable (which seemed more 'green' to me). However, this one has as much power and has held it's charge for 2 months now with no trouble.While I liked the interchangeable picks on the Water-Pic brand this one seems to be a much better value if you are looking for a small, portable version."
3,"Good, but","I will use this oral irrigator almost every day, but control of this product is a bit iffy. You are not supposed to irrigate your tongue or throat, but the irrigator seems to have a mind of its own. Still, for the price, this product has real value and I would buy it again."
4,Improved but can do better,"The new Panasonic oral irrigator is a vast improvement over the old one. It has a significantly largerwater reservoir and a much better ""holding-pen"" for the irrigator tip when not in use. However, the little latch-door over the water-filling hole came off almost immediately - as did the one on my old Panasonic and only the fact that it came off where I could find it keeps the implement usable. I had to get rid of the old one when I lost the latch. Batteries never last as long as one might wish but that's a minor cavil. And it's a bit heavy, but one of the few portable irrigators available and better than its few competitors. Overall, at the price, it's a good tool."
3,cnp,"I try for about a week, and I don't like that much. If the company makes a tip with smaller opening where it doesn't shoot out that much water (less messy job) and thus will also increase the pressure, I don't mind to invest in the new tip and give it a try again.... That's just give me an idea; I'm going to reduce the opening of the tip with ""crazy glue"" and see how it works."
1,Panasonic Oral Irritator,"Yes, I know. It says irritator and not irrigator. This was intentional. While the unit worked well for a time, it exploded during use and caused me eye and facial damage. The pieces of the device were scattered throughout the bathroom. I am contacting Panasonic to seek compensation."
1,Panasonic Portable Irrigator - Save Your Money,"The portable irrigator is difficult to use. Water sprays all over - outside your mouth. You have to refill it with water several times during one cleaning. And it doesn't effectively clean the food in your mouth. At times, it irritates your gums. Save your money and wait for a better product!!!"
1,KEEP AWAY,The device fell off the sink onto the bathroom floor AND BROKE!!!!! The plastic is so brittle it can't take a simple spill. I am very disappointed. My suggestion: KEEP AWAY from this product.
1,I wish I could get my money back,"It was very powerful, but very uneven. And seriously my bathroom mirror kept getting soaked. PLUS there should be two speeds. Not just one long stream which you can't control. Grrrrrrrrrr, wish I would get my money back."
1,Broke before I could use it.,"Worked when I first put the batteries in -- but when I tried to use it the first time, it didn't work. Tried three sets of batteries - still didn't wor!!"
5,Power washer for your teeth,"I have had a lot of trouble keeping food out of the space between two crowns, as well as other cracks and crevases in my mouth. This product was very easy to use, and worked very well. I was afraid when the label said ""bleeding"", but I suffered no ill effects whatsoever. It can shoot water all over if you are not careful, and you need to refill it after cleaning two or three teeth, but it is worth it. I highly recommend it."
1,Poor Design,"There is only one speed, which is really strong and empties the water tank way too quick. Basically the tank holds enough water to last about 5 seconds. If you accidentally push on the top half of the item while holding it water spills out at the center of the device. In addition the product is too big and bulky for the average woman's hand. It is hard to direct the water flow in your mouth and hold it at the same time. What a mess it can make, water was everywhere."
4,Wife uses it,"I hardly ever use it but my wife seems to like it. Blasts the crud loose (talking about my own mouth, don't know about hers.) OK, the 20-word requirement is done, Submit. Or, quit before the hole gets deeper."
1,Junk!,Device worked for a few months then something clogged the water intake. Dead! Can't get into the thing (of course) so there it sits. This is not to mention the miniscule capacity of the water supply. OK. Lesson learned. Went and bought a full fledged Waterpik.
4,still working after 2 years,"I've used this device after lunch and when travelling for two years, and it is still working. This device is not as strong as an electric one that you might use at home, but for situations like travelling or work this is a great device for continuing your dental hygiene. This was one purchase that was worth the cost of the device."
4,Quite Happy considering Price and Size,"Althouhg this is not a substitute for Flossing, but is quite effective in cleaning in-between the teeth.Althouhg some people have commented about low battery life and need to refill the same several times during a single use, I am qwite satisfied with both these parameters.Good Buy"
1,Sandblaster for the mouth,"I was expecting the force of the spray to be adjustible, as it is for my standard waterpik. I was stunned when I first turned it on and found that it could shoot water 10 feet across the room.Great for terrorizing my cats. Completely useless for my mouth."
4,Great little machine,"At 63 and just NOW getting braces, I was desperate for a way to clean my teeth (since flossing is all but impossible now, even with that silly little needle threading device they give you to pull floss between your teeth). I read tons of reviews here and other places and settled on this Panasonic unit. I'm on the road a lot so portability was paramount.It's been two weeks now and I use this thing almost to excess. I HATE all that chow that wedges itself in and around the metal-works. In fact, I find that I eat less often now simply because it's such a pain in the butt to clean up and look civilized afterwords. I do have to make sure I keep replacement batteries around because they don't last forever. And I usually have to fill the tank twice for a thorough cleaning. But hey, it's portable, so you can't expect a canteen with a hose.All in all, I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone who needs this type of cleaning (ESPECIALLY if you're wearing braces - ha)."
1,Keeps collapsing,"I would give this a 5 because it is very portable & works well, but it keeps collapsing while using it. You have to stop, open the door & dry it off so you can pull it out again. I was also disappointed that the instructions say not to use a mouthwash in it."
5,Terrific Product,"I'm delighted with this product. To be sure, it doesn't perform at the level of, say, the Hyrdo Floss stationary model. That's just not realistic for a battery-operated portable. It does, however, perform quite well, certainly well enough to be valued for travel use. I recommend this highly."
2,Not enough power,This one has a great design for travel but I found two issues1) Not enough power2) Water tank i too smallI returned mine.
3,panasonic portable oral irrigator,"Not much power, but it does the job. Tip seems to be a flimsy. Used it for 18 day trip to China with wife on one set of batteries."
4,Does what's supposed to do,I was looking for something in addition to regular teeth. So it's a nicely add-on. The water container sure is small and I usally need 2nd refill. However the machine itself is small and handy too and not very noisy compared to the larger water piks.
4,Great on the go oral irrigator.,"I bought 4 Portable Oral Irrigators for my family for stocking stuffers. I am not a dental hygienist, but believe that after having my gums scraped once that you cannot floss enough. My 7-year-old son uses the product twice a day, when before flossing was a bowl of tears and rarely occuring. It is simple to use, and does what it needs to do. I wish they made the unit or the ""pik"" in different colors so you can differentiate users. We solved the problem with a Sharpie. Also it has no power adjustment like the electric ones do, so if you are ultra sensitive, it may take a while to get used to. Keep in mind you are buying a ""portable"" irrigator, so those things should not be expected. Good price point too."
3,"Works good, but - - - -","My wife and I use a 110 VAC WaterPik daily. We purchased this Panasonic battery-powered device to accompany us on a recent cruise because it is smaller and more compact than the WaterPik. The unit works well, but it is not as powerful as our 110 VAC unit. It take two, or three, fillings to complete its job, but that's certainly not a real drawback. We find it very useful as a travel companion, but I wouldn't want to use it as a replacement for our more powerful WaterPik."
4,Compact and easy to use.,"I have now been using the Panasonic EW1270AC for over three months on a daily basis and find it to be a great purchase. It is not as powerful as my AC powered reservoir tank Water-Pik, but it is far more convenient to use and does a good job. So, instead of using the AC powered once a week, I use the Panasonic every night and my gums and teeth are clearly in better condition. It is small enough to keep it near my sink without it being very intrusive, thus making it very convenient to pick up and use at any time.I use rechargeable AA batteries so am not very concerned about battery life which appears to be about 30 uses on non-rechargeable alkaline.The Panasonic is great for traveling, easily fitting into my toiletries case. I originally bought it for traveling, but am so pleased with it that I now use it every day.Strongly recommended."
3,Oral Irrigator,"Unit arrived in excellent condition & functions as advertised, however, will upgrade in the future to a unit that develops higher stream pressure."
3,Good Portable Unit,"This Irrigator performs fairly well, but not great. I bought it as a replacement for my WaterPik that unfortunately died after one year of use. The WaterPik was cordless with a rechargeable battery and it was somewhat more powerful. You could not, however, travel with it unless you brought along its base unit. This unit (Panasonic) uses disposable batteries that require replacement each month if used daily. It is, however, therefore better for travel than the WaterPik. I think while the Panasonic is not quite as powerful it probably does an adequate job of cleaning the gum pockets; which my dentist says is the real benefit of using an Irrigator. I use it everyday after brushing and my dentist says he sees an improvement in my dental hygiene and, more specifically, health of gums."
5,Three Outsiders,"The three outsiders are Blaise Pascal, Soren Kierkegaard, and Simone Weil. They were outsiders, because they distanced themselves from the institutional church of their respective eras. They felt that the Church failed to take seriously the profound and disturbing relationship with God which is in Christ Jesus. From their position ""outside"" they questioned the assumptions and understanding of their contemporaries. As creative theologians, these three each produced original but dificult writings which professor Allen has synthesized and interpreted for anyone who asks the question, ""How am I to be a Christian?""--- from book's back cover"
5,Book has gone through 2 kids and still great!,"Both of my kids love this book. My daughter at 4 1/2 still loves it. It's been a staple baby shower gift for us and so far we've gotten nothing but huge ""thank you's"" for giving it. It's truely a book that the child loves and the parent loves reading."
3,doesn't absorb water,"It's small and packs well. And keeps your hair from dripping all over you. But it doesn't absorb water well so when I take my hair out of it, it is practically just as wet as when I got out of the shower."
1,Not for Java logs,"This grate does not work with Java logs. It has so much iron in it that it sucks too much heat away and does not let the log burn to completion, leaving glowing embers for many, many hours."
4,Nothing new under the sun!,"Ancient History of Universalism (1885). This book presents an excellent overview of ancient writers and key figures in church history who have defended the view that all men (or all intelligent creatures) will ultimately be saved, healed and reconciled with God. Although the period ranging from AD 100 to AD 550 is the main subject of the book, AD 550 to AD 1500 is discussed in an Appendix. In passing, Dr.Ballou shows that many opinions defended in (Ultra)-Dispensationalism were already propagated in mediaeval times (e.g., the view that water baptism and all other rites and ceremonies should have ceased after Messiah died on the cross and was raised from the dead). It was sobering to discover that there is nothing new under the sun!"
3,Informative and mind-opening!,"Very valuable in understanding how to understand and communicate with a mormon. The section on Contrasting LDS teachings with the Word of God, is very amazing. It is put in simple and easy to follow format."
5,All geologists should read this,"Great book about the May 18, 1980 volcanic eruption at Mount St. Helens in Washington State. The evidence gathered from this catastrophe has converted many secular scientists away from uniformitarianism. Mount St. Helen's eruption essentially carved out a mini-Grand Canyon through mudslides, pyroclastic flows, steam explosions and air fall tephra in a very short period of time. Lots of stupendous photographs."
2,"cd overproduced, voice underproducing","I absolutely love Mr.Mitchell's voicein it's full, rich, vibrant force; sadly, I did not get to experience it on this cd. I am sure I was one of many many fans who eagerly awaited his first cd. It is so sad he decided to try to corral his beautiful voice to become a lounge-jazz singer and whisper his way through most of this effort. Most singers today HAVE to whisper through their songs, as they have no real power. How ironic, Mr. Mitchell Elects to to do this!! He should have let someone else produce this cd and really let his voice shine. Further, as is true of so many performers today, he has chosen to Over Embelish this cd with so much Nonsense background sound. This cd is ridiculously over produced. His voice is ALL that is necessary. I hope he makes another cd soon giving us what we hoped for in this one. SG"
3,The Jazzier Stokes,"SO...I am a huge fan of the work of the amazingly talented Brian Stokes Mitchell. While this album does not dip into his hearty lower register which so many of his fans have come to love him for, it does show that he is a beautiful jazz singer. His riffs on ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" are soulful and inspired. I also fully enjoy ""Another Hundred People/Take the A Train"" and ""How Glory Goes"", as well as the gospel styled ""Grateful"". While some songs are a bit too airy for my taste, I still feel like the overall album is a success for Mr.Mitchell yet again. I think he is trying to reach a broader audience and get into a style of music that he hasn't been able to sing in his Broadway performances. This album just shows how talented he is and how amazing his range can be. Perhaps in the future, he will release another solo record that gives us that thunderous voice that we all love. For now, this debut cd will be well worn out in my player!"
1,a dissapointment,"Don't get me wrong, I love Brian Stokes Mitchell. His deep voice is intoxicating and beautiful, which was why this CD was such a dissapointment. All his songs are high and do not show off his wonderful low voice. Mitchell should stick to what he does best and it is not covers of songs made for tenors. I hope his next album will be more fit for his voice, I'll be the first in line!"
2,Disapointed,"Guess I expected too much. I thought I'd be hearing the same powerful, wonderful, magical voice I heard on the Carnagie Hall production of South Pacific. It didn't happen. Of course I only heard this man that one time, but beleive me this CD doesn't sound like the same guy. I think Bryan Stokes is just trying too hard to be innovative and it bombed. Far too many jazz singers out there that can do it better."
5,I can't understand the negative comments....,"I think that Stokes Mitchell's Cd shows the astounding talent that this man possesses. I saw him first on the public TV concert version of South Pacific and couldn't wait to order everything that he has done. While I was surprised to hear his arrangements of many of my favorites, I was impressed with the depth and versatility and the range of his very beautiful voice on this very personal and well thought out work. He puts many of the jazz greats to shame and even though some of the songs are hardly new, he makes them seem that way. For those who criticize, listen again...at full blast of sound and realize that this entertainer is a national treasure. Keep up the good work Stokes...."
2,Disappointing,"After watching the PBS production of South Pacific, I thought getting this Brian Stokes Mitchell CD would be a no-brainer. I anticipated hearing a series of top-rate songs with that glorious bass-baritone voice pouring out of my system. Mr. Mitchell chose, however, to record his material in a light breathy voice that left me constantly asking, ""Where's the beef?"" I've seen Mr. Mitchell on television quite a few times, and I've always been impressed by his singing. With great regret I have to say this CD just doesn't work for me."
2,Not What I Expected,Was really looking forward to this disc and was sadly disappointed. It is not the voice I know and had hoped to hear. Alas!!
2,"Two stars, only out of pity...","...this CD deserves one star if any at all!When I first heard there would be a Stokes Mitchell CD, with great anticipation, I was looking forward to the rich deep Broadway voice. I have admired all of his Broadway work from center orchestra and have never been disappointed.Unfortunately on this CD, ""Stokes"" tries to broaden his horizons, and tries, very successfully, to become a bad lounge singer. This makes for an awful waste of a disc. Perhaps that is why over thirty people are trying to sell theirs here at what, perhaps five bucks?Wouldn't it have been great if this CD captured the typically fantastic ""Stokes Mitchell"" Broadway voice that we know and love."
1,This is absolutely the worst CD someone with his talent could make.,"If he took this effort to American Idol, he wouldn't make it past the first audition. I've been waiting for him to make a CD by himself, but this is so disappointing that I don't know why he bothered. I wish I could give this CD a negative 5 stars. A great talent completely wasted...what a shame..."
2,Did someone try to clone Michael Feinstein?,"I was also eagerly looking forward to this CD as I have been known to swoon at Brian Stokes Mitchell's powerful yet nuanced performances. Instead, this collection of over produced and over stylized songs left me queasy. I supposed if you like Michael Feinstein's breathy, highly emotive ""singing"" then you'd like this too, but I'd have preferred to have someone with a strong voice actually singing rather than ""styling."" It seemed like you could just see the label folks sitting around a table suggesting that a talent like BSM try being less talented like some other ""lounge/jazz"" singers today who are selling disks. Oh well, I'll go back to listening to South Pacific for that true BSM talent."
1,The Ultimate Disappointment,"Dreadful recordings of some of the finest songs ever written for the Broadway stage. Stephen Sondheim must be livid over the treatment his classics received here. It appears Mr. Stokes Mitchell longs to be a jazz singer, and I'm sure will please hardcore jazz fans who appreciate innovative interpretations. But for those of us who favor the Broadway stylings we've come to appreciate from this great artist this first solo album that we've waited so long for is the ultimate disappointment. This is the last time I'll pre-order a recording without benefit of being able to sample selections before purchasing."
1,What a Waste of a Voice!,"Having heard Mr. Mitchel's robust and beautiful stage voice, this CD came as quite a shock! He sings in a panty, breathy style that is mediocre (if not worse). There is virtually nothing unique about his interpretations. There is not a hint of his extraordinary range and operatic voice. Nothing in this CD sets him apart from your average ""pop"" style. What an utter dissapointment! What a waste of an exceptional talent!"
4,"Not what I expected, but not bad!","I was expecting that powerful voice we've all come to know and love , but I find myself quite liking this new Stokes. ""Life is Sweet"" comes closer to what I'm used to, but his loungy sound is still just as gorgeous and rich as can be. If you're a true fan of this great performer, by the CD now, and if you don't want to hear him trying on a new sound, stick to the Man of La Mancha OBRC. I quite enjoyed this, overall."
3,Less would have been so much more...,"I adore BSN and I'll pretty much take him any way I can get him, but this recording has too many frills, flourishes and swooping, swooning strings. This is a voice that needs nothing, and the overproduction here is a distraction and a shame. The greatest strength of this wonderful artist, beyond his glorious voice, is his ability to transform a piece of music by inhabiting it, and it's a wonderful thing indeed. These arrangements are over-embellished the singer is lost in the uproar, and the songs somehow lose their meaning. The highlight on this cd is ""Just In Time"" which is, for the most part, a straight-ahead swing arrangement and Stokes sounds natural, easy, and great."
2,Stokes Searches for His Inner Luther Vandross,"I am a huge--HUGE--fan of BSM so I got this CD as early as I possibly could by directly ordering from Playbill Records. The first arrangement of Something's Coming is very nice indeed but the CD goes downhill fast. I wanted to hear the Stokes I've enjoyed in so many stage shows and concerts with that rich baritone voice that is so rare nowadays. Instead what I got was a lackluster track listing and I don't think he goes below middle C in the whole album. The medley of Take the A Train/Another Hundred People is nice and Being Alive finally gets pretty good halfway through. But all this breathy, panting, gasping soul singer/Motown style proves to be annoying because, and I'll state this simply: YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE THE SINGER!!! This CD is finding its way to eBay pretty quickly!"
1,Brian Stokes Mitchell,"This CD was a terrific disappointment! The up tempo arrangements do nothing to showcase Mitchell's excellent voice. He comes across very shallow and flat. A second-rate Mel Torme or Bobby Short. Having seen him on Broadway, I looked forward to this album, only to now consider it a waste of money. There were two songs that gave some credence to his being a vocalist of great quality, but just barely. If you loved his Broadway performances, look elsewhere."
2,"Stokes, I want my money back",I saw Brian Stokes Mitchell perform on-stage in Ragtime and Kiss Me Kate. He performs with charisma and a beautiful baritone voice...both of which are missing from this recording. The songs here are over-produced and under-sung....mostly in Claudine Longet-style breathiness that quickly grows monotonous. A real mis-fire.
2,Is this really Brian Stokes Mitchell singing?,"I eagerly awaited this album, ever since hearing Mr. Mitchell sing in the Kiss Me Kate CD. His singing in Kiss Me Kate is unbelievably gorgeous, with his lustrous baritone nuancing every phrase and word. The singer on this CD is hardly recognizable as the same singer. The timbre of the voice is not the same, Mr. Mitchell is trying to sound like a lounge singer, not the magnificent Broadway star he is.I hope he does another album, the next time bringing to life great Broadway songs in the style of his Kiss Me Kate and Man Of La Mancha performances."
1,Hugely disappointing,"This album doesn't come near doing justice to Stoke's talent. The arrangements are awful... some of the song choices are uninspired, and Stokes is so determined to make each of these songs ""his own"" that I found myself repeating ""just sing the damn song"" repeatedly as I skipped through the CD.I fell in love with Stoke's voice in Ragtime, and even traveled from LA to DC to see him do Sweeney Todd.. .so I was pre-disposed to like this CD. Instead, I found it to be one of the most disappointing cds I've ever purchased.It's hard to believe, but Stokes doesn't seem to trust or understand his magnificent baritone, and really seems to need the guidance of a Director (or in the case of a CD, a Producer) to reassure him and guide him away from career-damaging projects like this self-indulgent CD."
1,I agree...it's a disappointment,"I agree with those who gave this CD a big thumb's down. Where, oh where is that glorious voice that we love? He's singing out of his range and I think he sounds a bit like Nina Simone. Hope the next CD is better!"
1,"If you loved him in the ""South Pacific"" concert, don't buy this!","I ordered this because of Brian Stokes Mitchell's incredible performance in the concert version of ""South Pacific."" What a terrible disappointment this CD was. It is almost impossible to believe that this is the same artist I so enjoyed in ""South Pacific"" and the great mystery to me is how he ever came to be cast in that amazing special. As far as I am concerned, the purchase of the ""Brian Stokes Mitchell""CD was money down the drain; but if he ever decides to record an album in his ""South Pacific"" voice, I might buy it."
2,"I don't like his music style, however love his voice.",I saw him perform in South Pacific and bot his CD because of his voice. Voice is wonderful...style is not for me.
1,Brian Stokes Mitchell's first CD,"Shame on me for thinking that if I bought this long awaited CD, I'd recognize the artist. What a shock and disappointment this CD is. You have to listen long and hard to find evidence of that gorgeous baritone voice. Most of the songs are so tedious that it is difficult to make it to the end. I've listened to this CD once and will soon be listing it for sell on Amazon. Such a shame that his beautiful voice is not displayed in a manner that compliments his many talents. Oh well, maybe the next one will be better !!!!"
2,"Very disappointed, don't care for the arrangements","I had seen Mr. Mitchell on Broadway in Kiss Me Kate and Man of La Mancha and fell in love with his voice. I have been listening to the Broadway cast albums over and over and had been hoping that one day there would be a solo CD of his. When the CD was finally announced I saw all my prayers answered and ordered it the first day it was released. All I can say, it may be Brian Stokes Mitchell but it's not the voice I know and love and while I know many of the songs on the CD by name they surely sound different. Others might like it but it's not at all what I had expected."
2,What a waste of a fine voice,Very disapointed. We expected a nice baritone voice with a pleasure to listen to. Not at all what we expected
1,Only for die-hard Petra Fans who owned this album before,"I'm in my 40s and bought this album as a kid. It's not that good. However, the song ""Lucas McGraw"" is fantastic. Petra is one of my favorite groups and I want this CD to complete my collection. However, for most people I would recommend any of their other CDs, but skip this one. Bob Hartman sings on this CD and his voice isn't that good. Some of the songs aren't that good at all. Another 70s CD is ""Come & Join US."" It is pretty old, but a much better CD. Greg Voltz also sings some of the songs on it. I would recommend this CD for old timers before getting their first one (""Petra"")."
5,Hear Petra's versatility on their First Album - again,"This CD is a re-release of Petra's first album - digitally remastered for CD. This was a landmark album, in that it was done at a time when rock music was not considered a medium for Christian Music.Even so, the music is great! Their musical variety is shown in various tracks - from the straight ahead 'Walkin' in the Light' to the ballad 'Mountains and Valleys', a country & western rockabilly 'Lucas McGraw' (a must hear), to the 'Backsliding Blues'No Petra collection would be complete without this album as few, if any, of these songs have ever been re-released on any Petra compilation (War & Remembrance, Petra means Rock, Petrafied, etc.)Petra fan"
3,Good for the die hard Petra fan.,"With this being for the die harders, the music is not what we have come to execpt. The track GONNA FLY AWAY is a great track. WAKE UP is also a good track. This album has a flare of its own. No where near the caliber of Beyond Belief or More Power To Ya, but worth the money none the less. It has a distinct 70's flare, and remindes me at time of the early Eagles. Definetly a must have for the true Petra fan"
3,Nice CD Set,I got this CD set at a sale price and I like it. Has some of the Muddy greats as well as a few I haven't heard. Keep in mind that most of the songs are live so don't expect that studio sound. Also fits Nicely in my LP collection.
4,Rubber Grip For Your Glock,"I installed this grip on a Glock 17C. I found the standard plastic grip on the Glock lack a certain positive response to my hand. As a large fat rubber cylinder (akin to car inner tubing) its a bit of struggle to get these up on and over the hand ripples on the grip. The good news is these are tough rubber and can take alot of pulling, rolling, etc. Once on I found the feel of the gun in my hand is very tight. Along with this tightness in your hand also comes a noticeable increase in the feel of the kick. I would recommend these for what they are: away to cover the handle of your gun with rubber that is far gripper than plastic."
4,Pachmyer large grip with finger groves,Bought for keltec Sub2000 fit fine. Just had to cut a little bit off the bottom. Improved the grip and feel.
2,pinacle studio 10 little help,"The book does little that the owners manual doesn't already do. No tutorial, just description of functions. A big disappointment because I need some coaching."
4,Brush works but the other side doesn't verywell,The brush cleans the tongue very well. I just don't like the other side as it doesn't work as well as a flat end. I have a tongue cleaner without a brush and it's just flat which works a lot better and doesn't cause bleeding.
1,Eh,"I agree with the person who rated it a 3. I wanted it to get all the gook at the back of my tongue. The stuff that I could literally see back there but could never reach.*I used the brush side and started making gag noises.*Yeah it's just like a toothbrush, but I can get more done with a regular brush.*Like another person said, it caused me some tongue bleeding, so I had to scrub softer and still didn't get much off.*& lastly, it um, didn't reach back there and get any of the junk, b/c I kept gagging and it just couldn't reeach. Waste of my money."
3,it cleans tongues.,"my son asked me for it and i got it. it did not come with whatever tube of whatever is shown on the picture posted here, but in the posting i ordered from it didn't have that anyway."
3,"Good writing, yet annoying","I like Dara Joy's stuff, but this book didn't really appeal to me. It read like a regency romance with the male and female roles switched and then she added on a lot of terms and phrases to makes it futuristic. I liked the main characters, but I had a hard time keeping their supposed social roles in mind (male is weak, female has control over him). Add to that the fact that skipping to the glossary is occaisionally neccessary, and the book gets kind of awkward. It wasn't a bad book, but I didn't like it as much as her Matrix of Destiny books."
1,The Worst Dara Joy Book Ever,"...This book is the worse Joy has ever produced. The science and social stucture are cumbersome to describe and Joy's description of them lack imagination.She produced a society of women have developed very sexist and elitist atitudes. What a disappointment, I was hoping that the women would be more gentle leaders. Also her terms describing the various titles was confusing. She should have just stuck to the feminine version of a title e.g., ""duchess"" and labeled the male as ""ducal consort"" or something simple. She calls Claudine a ""she-Count"" and refers to another Top Slice member as an ""Earlene"". To my knowledge, both count and earl are equal titles. Call me a nit-picker but the title usage did bother me somewhat. Hopefully her next book will be an improvement."
2,Role reversal rubbush!,"The story is a basic historical romance with the roles reversed - The man is the young, (in his 20s) unmarried, spirited character, and the woman is a sophisticated ""marquelle"" (get it?)in her mid-30s. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. Men and women are not interchangeable when it comes to roles, however inequitable they are. I could deal with the females being the actual power and brains of the society, if the men had to defer to them because of some perceived weakness in their macho natures. To have them actually submissive and somewhat maidenly killed any sex appeal as far as I was concerned. There is the typical ballroom scene where the heroine, Green, sees the hero, Jorlan, and remembers him as a young spirited boy and decides he's grown up to be sexually interesting. I just couldn't buy into these two people. I gave the book back to the library, happy I didn't pay for it. Save yourselves."
1,Everything I expected. And that's bad.,"Unoriginal characters, rubbish dialogue and freakishly stupid 'descriptive' paragraphs. In some places, the gender roles are just reversed completely with no thought of logic. In other places, they aren't reversed far enough for logical thought.I consider this story to be Dara Joy's fantasies of controlling men, cunningly hidden behind a smokescreen of a struggle for equality. I mean, what other explanation is there for a story where the male protagonist is forced to all but swallow his own juices? By his new WIFE, no less!Either that, or it's one of those cunningly hidden feminist dogma things. By being billed as a reversal of the battle of the sexes, it's implanting into the minds of the readers that whatever men suffer in the book, women suffer in real life.Thus, more people are conditioned into railing against what women 'suffer'.Either way, this book belongs in the bin. Even as a parody, it doesn't even work right."
1,Let's hope this isn't a trend.,"I bought this book because I love Dara Joy's writing and was very excited to see that she had a new one out. This was a horrible disappointment. It's a complete role reversal between male and female roles and comes across as ridiculous. If a man had done the things the heroine did in this book to the hero women readers would be crying foul. I hope this is not a sign of a new trend of stories.I would love to see Dara continue with the Matrix series as well as her High Energy and High Intensity series. Anything at all except for another one of these. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their money on this book, try the library first."
1,Left me feeling icky,"I've only mildly enjoyed most of Ms Joy's previous novels except for ""Mine To Take"" which I loved (easily 5 out of 5), but this story kind of grossed me out. The fantasy world is kind of a Regency with male-female role reversal...the women are 'rakes' and the men should be virgins. But while I read the story, I couldn't help feeling it was like a 35 year old woman sleeping with an 17 year old boy. It kind of grossed me out. I can't remember what their actual ages were, but this is how it was reading to me. Don't get me wrong, it icks me out when its the other way as well...I don't like reading about guys in their 30s & 40s sleeping with teenage girls either. I couldn't get beyond that impression so I couldn't like the book. To each their own. Some people seem to have loved the story."
3,"Okay, but......","It's not the situation, it's not the characters, it's the freaking vocabulary errors. Joy and her editors need to get on the ball here: this is not the first time this author has derailed me from an otherwise good story with misused homonyms and tortured syntax. The concept of a role-reversed victorian romance is engaging though."
4,"Interesting, but not enthralling.","Not as bad as this Regency style gender switch story could have been. Unfortunately, not as good as I expected from Dara Joy. In her talented hands, the story kept my interest throughout. However...there were too many loose threads and the characterizations of everyday men and women too rigid. Even in Regencies, you have all types among the ""weaker sex"", from the rule-follower to the rule-breaker. The language devised by Joy was the best of all, keeping me guessing how she came up with the particular phrase."
5,"Jorlan, Jorlan, Jorlan","What a character, in more ways than one. To fully experience this book, you have to read this book. That is all I am going to say. A must read."
1,sadly disappointed,I am a huge Dara Joy fan and I have all of her books but I wish I had saved my money and left this on the shelf. The book was simply not up to the standard that I have come to expect from her. The story was ludicrous and itshould never have made it past the editors. I have no idea what anyone could find in this book to like.
2,A mis-step or a glimpse into the future?,"To begin, I enjoy the Matrix of Destiny series, and hope Dara Joy's problems with her publisher are resolved soon ... I want to read the rest of the series.But as to Ritual of Proof, I spent the entire reading experience waiting for the story to improve. However, it started out poorly and ended that way. I found it tedious, boring, and lacking imagination.She sets the book up as if it is a beginning to a series, but doesn't leave me wanting more.Following MOD, perhaps I expected too much. Would I have been as disappointed had another author written it?"
2,ROP falls short of Matrix Series,"Dara Joy is a very gifted and imaginative author. I have really enjoyed her previous novels, especially the Matrix Series. I was very excited to learn that she had her first hardcover novel out. ROP definitely had a new twist on the male/female relationship. I give her an A+ for creativity. But I found all the new vocabulary rather tedious. At least for me, the story and characters did not measure up to previous novels. I was disappointed in that. I hope that this novel is not a springboard for more of this same genre. She pretty much covered the role reversal idea---any more would be redundant. Please, Dara, return to the Matrix Series!"
3,Why not?,"This book starts off a bit inane, and Ms Joy should be forbid to use the word ""rare"" in her works from now on, but gets more exicting about 100 pages in (it's a very fast read). There are some very goofy characters in the novel, as well as some very silly-sounding dialogue. However, the last 100 pages contain not only beautiful love scenes, but beautiful relationships between the couple (Green and Jorlan), between parents and child, and between (hu)man and nature."
4,I liked it.,"I am suprised at the negative reviews of this book. This was the first Dara Joy book i ever picked up and i loved it, I have defentaly read books by her that were far worse. I thought this book was unique."
2,Fell Flat,"I love Dara Joy, but ROP fell flat. Ms. Joy is capable of much better writing than this. I felt the book was rushed and very shallow. Hopefully, her next offering will return to her usual fantastic style."
1,If you prefer alpha males do not bother,I did not enjoy this book as I truly prefer alpha males. Even though the man in this book is trying to become more dominant there just wasn't enough testosterone in this book for me. I much prefer Dara Joy's other books.
2,Tedious,"Dara Joy is one of my very favorite authors. I expected to like this books as much as the others.I was wrong. It was slow and the characters were boring. The book dragged. I could find no interest as to whether these two people ever got together. I did not like the setting of the book. I will pretend she didn't write this, and wait for the next one.I await more of the matrix series. More perhaps with some of the other characters in her books that beg for additional adventures.I look forward to the adventures of the Rose."
2,I was really disappointed.,"When I saw this book I couldn't wait to read it. Dara Joy did such a good job on ""Night of a Trillion Stars"" and ""Rejar"" I really thought I would enjoy this one too. But I really don't like week men, and that is how Jorlan came off to me. I guess I am old fashion when it comes to reading romances.I will definitely read more of Dara Joys books. I just didn't like this story. I still hope she will be coming out with a story for Traed from ""Night of a Trillion Stars""."
3,A Fresh Idea Got Old Fast!,"I have loved most of Dara Joy's books - particularly the Matrix Series (not fond of the modern novels, though). I ordered this one without knowing much of its basic premise. While finding it refreshing for the first 50 pages or so, the entire premise got old fast. So much of it is ridiculous on its face that I lost interest in it. Emasculating a hero does not still leave a hero, in my eyes. And personal preference, of course - but I did not enjoy most of the love scenes, particularly the first one. I am with some of the other readers who have asked - please do NOT make this a series start. I will not read another one in such a series."
1,A waste of time and money,"I was really disappointed. For all of you who thought MOD, or even the ""High"" series, this comes nowhere near. The characters are flat. The story line had a lot of potential, but its one disjointed paragraph after the next. I am really looking forward to the next MOD book, but I hope that the writing improves substantially before that."
1,Couldn't even finish the book,"This book was a huge disappointment! All in all, it was just too boring to bother finishing. The characters didn't interest me at all, and the story line was entirely too predictable after a few pages. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,TOTALLY SHOCKED & TOTALLY WEIRD,I HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING A BOOK BY DARA JOY AND THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. WOMEN IN CHARGE OF THE WORLD! NICE BUT IT IS A LITTLE WEIRD FOR MY TASTE. IT WAS A WONDERFUL BOOK JUST LIKE ALL OF DARA'S BOOKS. IT JUST HAD SOME SERIOUS ROLE REVERSALS GOING ON. SENSUAL AND SEXY BUT NOT A KEEPER. WE NEED MORE ON TRAED AND THE BUNCH LETS LEAVE THESE GUYS WHERE THEY BELONG OUT IN SPACE.
1,Give this one a skip !,"I normally look forward to Dara Joy's books. The characters and location are usually fantastic, BUT, what happened here? This story was just too much for me. Ms. Joy swings from women being totally in charge (read domininering) and the men as total wimps. Oh, except for this one - who later has to be so gifted as to make the story even more unbelievable. I should have stopped in the first few chapters, but bravely made it through the whole thing. Next time I'll stop."
2,Role Reversal Romance? Too Extreme,"I have been a great fan of Dara Joy and was eagerly awaiting the release of Ritual of Proof. What a disappointment! I was kind of hoping she would continue her previous series with Traed as the hero. I love her futuristic and/or paranormal stories. Ritual Of Proof is a backwards romance with very strong woman. OK, I dont have a problem with strong heriones. Making men the weaker sex does have some appeal, but it was too extreme. Making the men prove they are virgins! Kind of a backwards victorian historical. I really believe woman are the stronger sex mentally and emotionally, but physically, not really.True romance readers want strong heriones but even stronger heros. Atleast I do. Don't be discouraged by reading her other books. ie Knight of a Trillion Stars, Rejar, and others. They were great reads."
2,a disappointment!,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer who was hunting for some missed creativity in this book. I couldnt find it either. The idea of a race where men are the subjugated ones was definitely interesting but I found that the book kept falling back to the old formula of ""Big strong man in charge"". An intriguing idea but not developed well."
1,I tried very hard to finish this book...,"alas, I could not. I adored Dara Joy's ""Matrix of Destiny"" series and was looking forward to ""Ritual of Proof"". However, I will have to agree with most of the reviews stated here. Not worth reading. I read many, many romances (as well as other genres) and often find good things to say about even the most horrid of books. That is not the case here. The main characters were flat and uninteresting. The entire idea of the male being 'breached' in a painful ritual just did nothing for me. I really tried to finish this book, but just couldn't. I won't recap the plot here, as many reviewers already have. I just felt so strongly about NOT liking this book, I had to put in my two cents."
2,The publisher had a hand in this one,"This book is obviously not a true Dara Joy book. From it's poor character development to the sketchy history, it's easy to tell the publisher had a hand in this one. It is not written with Dara's typical wit and attention to detail. Everything in this piece is a failure when compared to her other works. Compared to the average author, it rates slightly higher but I've come to expect a certain standard from Dara and this one falls far short, especially for hard cover. Shame on this publisher. Go away and let the authors write without hinderance so we can enjoy what they write."
3,Not too original.,"I liked the book, and the concept is interesting . . . however, it was just a little disappointing. The problem is that her society mirrors Regency England, just with the women in men's roles. This reversal would be interesting, but it was just the EXACT opposite of the old sex roles. In her book, the men are the weaker sex, abused and taken advantage of by women. It just wasn't very imaginative.After reading her other books, I expected more originality from her work. I really enjoyed the new world she brought to life in books like, ""Knight of a Trillion Stars,"" and ""Mine to Take."" Thus, if you expect this new book to be in line with her past book, you may be disappointed.However, this is Dara Joy book so it is still a decent read."
1,An unfortunate disappointment,"I enjoy Dara Joy's writing but this book was a disappointment. This is the first book of hers that read slow for me and while this book was touted as a highly original turn-about of the gender roles, I have read this theme in many other books. (Marilyn Campbell comes to mind.)"
1,An insult to the intelligence,"Where to start... I felt personally offended and affronted by this book. The plot, while hailed by some as terribly inventive and clever was dull, trite, and not the least bit compelling. The 'role reversal' of the sexes was done in such a way I often wondered if it was written by a five year-old. Books like this are the reason women are still oppressed in half the world. Please, God, do not waste your money on this frivilous romp of fantasty garbage."
2,Role Reversal Romance? Too Extreme,"I have been a great fan of Dara Joy and was eagerly awaiting the release of Ritual of Proof. What a disappointment! I love her futuristic and/or paranormal stories. Ritual Of Proof is a backwards romance with very strong women. OK, I dont have a problem with strong heriones. Making men the weaker sex does have some appeal, but it was too extreme. I really believe woman are the stronger sex mentally and emotionally, but physically, not really.True romance readers want strong heriones but even stronger heros. Atleast I do. Don't be discouraged by reading her other books. ie Knight of a Trillion Stars, Rejar, and others. They were great reads.Ritual of proof was a waste of money in my opinion."
5,Beneath the surface....,"Ritual of Proof, on the surface, creates a complex world where gender roles are switched. Males are ""fastened"" to the females and in the high society the lead character, Green Tamryn, lives in, the males must be pure to be fastened. Females are the leaders of the society, males are protected. Green Tamryn chooses to fasten Jorlan, against his will. Their meeting, her wooing of Jorlan and the consequent battle of wills has the common Dara Joy sensual threads throughout. But, what will keep me coming back again and again to read this book are the themes that are developed underneath the masks the main characters show to their world. The characters are multi-layered, and the layers are revealed slowly and perfectly throughout the book. ....and the layers themselves are complex and interwoven. This is a book that has depth. Not in her usual manner but incorporating the best romantic, sensual touches of her previous works with a brand new world to explore!"
3,Not my Cup of Romance...,"As ever, Ms. Joy's story is well-written, the plot moves right along, and there are some entertaining bits of humor to leaven the yeast. BUT, a world where the women have taken on the worst aspects of upper class British men during the Regency of the early 19th century? Eeeuuuuw!!!I prefer to have a fantasy/scifi world where people have evolved to something better than reverting back to such terrible habits. This book really bummed me because of that.It was an ok read, but it will not remain in my library."
1,Horrible,"Where do I begin! This book was so bad I could barely finish it. I read each of the Matrix of Destiny books on pins and needles. I love them so much I own two copies of each, yet this book was something else entirely. Unfortunately I can't state it quite the way I would like to because I doubt if Amazon[.com] would post my comments then. The characters were flat and uninspiring, especially the main characters. The concept of the story is interesting, but I find it hard to feel any sexual tension with a male character who is completely dominated by women. I mean lets keep it real here. We read romance novels for the men. If there aren't hot then the story isn't going to work. Jorlan was cute, but he seemed more like a boy then a man and I simply do not get off on boys. I give this book one star because as a few have suggested there seems to be a veiled reference to the Matrix of Destiny series."
2,A Sad Parody of Romance,"I was more than disappointed with this book. I have come to expect only the highest quality story from Dara Joy but this book seems to have been written to meet a deadline. The characters were poorly developed. The whole ""women rule the world"" premise came off as a parody and all the other-world slang was distracting. If I did not know any better I would think this was someone's first novel and certainly not worthy of being a hard back. Don't bother to buy it. If you have to read it, check it out from your local library."
2,Disappointing after all the hype...,"I loved the premise of this book but the actual book did not stand up to all it's pre-release hype. I was disappointed that the story was not fully developed and seemed to be rushed. The vocabulary that was invented was distracting as everytime I came across a new term (and there were lots of them) I had to go to the back of the book and look it up, it would have been easier to just use the standard lingo. I just wish there had been more ""meat"" to this story. If you must read it then wait for it in paperback, buy it used or borrow it from the library. It wasn't worthy of being HB in my opinion."
1,Stupid!!,"I cannot believe that I wasted money on this book.It is poorly written and incredibly stupid.If you feel you must read it, just check it out of the Library.Yuck."
2,Totally unforgiveable,"After the captivating success of ""Rejar"" and ""Mine To Take"", this book was a real let-down. I have no problems letting my imagination run wild (read Mine to Take, and you'll see what I mean), but this is ridiculous!A man whose first introduction to sex is painful because of the ""breaching"" - his! A woman who owns the man, and a planet ruled by women where men are subservient and play the traditional role of the women. That is going too far. Call me old-fashioned, but I hate it when the man is weak, and the woman ""breaches"" the man, not the other way around. And to top it off, they have to go to a court-type trial to prove that the man was a untouched when she first breached him, or there would be a scandal!I expected better from Dara Joy."
1,A Disappointed Fan!!,"I am a huge fan of Dara Joy. I cannot put into words my disappointment with this book. The concept of a female dominant society was very interesting. Unfortunately, this story was ridiculous. The portrayal of men in this book left a LOT to be desired. I could not think of them as men. Which, I guess, was the purpose of this book;they were definitely a new breed of men. There was nothing appealing about the characters. In addition, the futuristic terminology used was hideous. In one sentence, you have the everyday word ""sheets"". In another you have the word ""tasteslikerooster""???? I wish I had checked this out of the library instead of buying it based upon Ms. Joy's reputation. I will not make that mistake again."
4,Eighties Music Requirement,"I don't know what the fanbase of Paul Young is these days, but I doubt anyone who lived through the eighties (or early nineties, for that matter) didn't hear the song ""Every Time You Go Away"" enough times to know the lyrics subconsciously.The haunting melodies and smooth vocals that made Paul Young the revolutionary that he was are all gathered into this soulful collection of his greatest hits- topped off with that (perhaps somewhat pesky) aforementioned timeless #1 hit. All his songs have a quality of simple, refreshing pleasure. One listen is simply never enough to satisfy the taste of the album. You need listen after listen... and before long, I think you'll find this one in -*gasp!*- your car! Yes.. it's that addictive. From the rich sounds of drums and electricly-amped guitars right up to the soft, seamless vocals, any 80s music fan will find this a necessary addition to their collection."
4,good disc,i first became aware of Paul Young in 85 with the great remake of Hall&oats's everytime you go away.i dug the vocals.it had a soulful feel to it.other songs i dig by him are i'm gonna tear your playhouse down and a solid remake of the great Marvin Gaye's whereever i lay my hat(that's my home.Michael Bolten should take notes.Paul Young didn't have to brag about singing soulful cuz he can unlike strain Man Bolten.this is a good solid disc.
5,The best of the previous and the heat of his new soul,"There is a staggering combination of music here that lends itself to nearly every aspect of one's life. The re-releasing of his earlier hits reminds me of my innocence in the 80's. The ""new stuff"" are warm, wonderful jewels that warm, inspire, and fill the soul. Mr Young has an incredible voice and can find any hole in a soul's barriers and leak into so there is not one lonely space left. This is truly wonderful music."
3,Sometimes singles are the best way to go....,"Don't get me wrong - Paul Young has a great voice - and his hit songs were the reason why I wanted this CD. Outside of his radio hits, there are only about two or three other songs that are worth listening to on this CD."
2,HESOUNDS LIKE FRANK SINATRA,"I only like one song on this CD. The vocalist sounds like Frank Sinatra, and it is not the artist I thought it was, but we kept it because my husband likes to hear his music."
4,This is a great CD,"Truthfully, I had never heard of Paul Young, until I heard one of his songs on the radio. I did a search and found out who recorded it and went from there. I am very happy with the collection of songs on this CD."
1,Where's the Book?,"I paid for this thinking it would be a brief biography or summary of Estrin. It's not. It's a one-page list of his awards and books, data that could be picked up almost anywhere. What a disappointment. I will never buy from this service again."
5,Simply Hilarious!,"Alright, I too am American, and I absolutely love this show! I mean, it is just sooooo funny! I first saw it on Game Show Network when I couldn't sleep one night and now I'm hooked. My brother and I Tivo it every week and watch it together! My favorite episode may be who can cook better because Spenny finally decides to cheat...but still loses! Ha! It's hilarius. At first, you hate Kenny's deceiving ways, but now I look forward to him winning the competitions!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Actually, the Knight is no Saint.I will disagree there with the blurb on the inside of the hardcover.This insouciant adventure isn't a patch on Leslie Charteris' creation.This is supposed to be rather lighthearted, it would seem, but I didn't find it that amusing. There are several bad jokes and puns to be found here, so your mileage may very.The most interesting character was the supposedly telepathic mongrel doberman-labrador cross Guinness. Not enough book time for him. :)"
3,Not that good,"At first I started reading this book and I was impressed.I was quickly dissenchanted.The guy spends forever talking on each individual topic, and for each topic he talks only about one player. He spends time talking about defense, but instead of actually talking about schemes, strategies, etc., he only talks about Mike Strahan. He spends about fifty pages on Mike Strahan. He also spends sixty-five pages talking about John Gruden. Because of all this, this book is already outdated. I don't really recommend it."
2,Great Topics Boring Writer,"I could only make it halfway through this boring book. It's too bad too because it had potential.Recommendation to the author, try an write like a writer not a sports columnist.The style gets old very fast and takes away from the substance of what should be a great look into the NFL."
4,Great book please read,"Bloody Sundays is Just a book manly about a bunch of NFL football stories. It also talks about a bunch of good football players and how they got into the football business. Some of the reasons I liked this book is because it has a big chapter about one of the best halfbacks Emitte Smith, and the reason I liked that part of the book is because I really like Emitte Smith there for I liked reading and leaning about him. But with all the good things they were a couple things that I did not like. Some of the things I did not like are it left out a lot of the great football legends Like OJ Simpson, Joe Namath, Bart Star and, Barry Sanders. The reason that made me not like it is because they are football players I really liked and wanted to learn about so that made me made. That is my likes and dislikes of the book."
3,"Not Chaikin's best, but decent","I found the characters rather flat, even for romantic/historical fiction. The plot was slow and cumbersome. The questions being asked seemed repetitive, and the love story was frankly poorly done (I know Chaikin can do better!).All that said, the ending had some excitement and a really delicious twist, so I'm dead-neutral on this book. Read it if you will."
3,Disappointing,"i thought this was ok. i thought it was going to be more of an informational guide to japanese prejudices, but it was like a stupid round about mystery with situations that would never happen(letting an old guy sleep over your house by accident(that you had met that day!) and then divulge your horrendous secrets to him, letting him pose as your husbad for your surgery within a week of knowing him?) i tried to understand her japanese that she wrote, but it didn't make sense because she sucked at romaji. i could get the general idea though.PS: the ending sucked."
4,a good entertaining story,"This story, if not wildly exaggerated, paints a vivid albeit gloomy picture of japan. Although an entertaining read, I could not help but wonder if the author was slightly overexaggerating some of the reactions of the japanese to gaijin...But all in all, a pleasant read, and definitely worth the time to pick up! plus, you learn some japanese along the way..."
1,Double priced kindle book??,"I've been wanting to read this book (it's been on my wishlist for over a year), but how can the Kindle price be double that of the print price. I no longer purchase print media, excepting textbook format non-fiction.Don't penalize your readers."
5,Read this before working in Japan,"This is an excellent taste, encapsulated in an easily digested and entertaining storyline, of what it's like for a foreign woman working in Japan (for a Japanese company). I have lived and worked as an expat in Japan for nine months now and it's clear that Sara Backer did her homework and did it well. The storyline is engaging and believable and the humor works like a charm to bring the reader closer to the culture than any travel log. I can't recommend it more highly for anyone who loves Japanese culture, or who depends on a good story to transport them far away."
5,Loved it -- couldn't stop reading!,"American Fuji is funny, touching, charming and thought-provoking. It gives a quirky, entertaining (and at times hilarious!) picture of the American expatriate experience in Japan, but it also captures that peculiar struggle of modern times, where the things we care deeply about are not so much threatened by a grand and glorious evil, but chipped away by the petty, the absurd, and the banal. Loved the characters -- I stayed up too late reading because I couldn't stop until I'd found out how it ended for them. A great read!"
5,A fresh view of Japan and a fun read too.,"Although I've never been to Japan, this book took me there. It made me feel what it would be like to live in a culture that is truly ""inscrutable"" to the average American. The characters are likable, interesting and well-developed. The plot moves along swiftly with surprises at just the right places. It reminds me a little of some of Barbara Kingsolver's books. Both authors write in a fresh way about believable people whose lives manage to work out okay...not happily ever after, just okay. This was a very satisfying read. I was short on sleep several nights because I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to see what Ms Backer writes next!"
2,An introduction to leadership,"Having read various books on leadership over some period of time now, it is hard to draw conclusions that this book is of some what solid value to someone who has read other literature on the matter.Its style is simplistic and probably a good starting point for anyone interested in the topic of leadership. I feel this may be part due to the publisher of the title who publishes many other introductory books on various other topics for undergraduate usage. Whilst saying this, this book some may find ideal for high school graduates heading into higher education to complete a business degree for the first time and want to know what leadership is.Overall a good introduction to leadership, but for those who are looking for a more serious book on the topic, prehaps ""The Leadership Challenge"" by Kouzes & Posner will be found useful."
2,Average book,"This is an average book at best. I would not recommend it to anyone. If you think you would like it, you should read the book Powell wrote himself. It will help you understand this book."
4,Great book for aspiring leaders,I found this to be a great read in regard to management and leadership from one of the countries most admired men.
4,It Sucks..... But That's What It's Made To Do!!!!,"We have a Dyson for the carpets, but it's actually heavy and not easily used on stairs. The Constellation actually fulfills quite a niche. It's quiet, has very good power, well made components; and floats easily from Pergo/Wooden floors to carpet.The Constellation is well made and is not like most cheap plastic models on sale in large box stores.I highly recommend it!"
2,Interesting design but. . . .,"We purchased the Constellation because we have always had reliable service from our Hoover appliances and wanted to try the Constellation's novel ""floating"" feature, but this did not make up for its heavy weight and awkward shape. It is especially difficult to rewind the long cord around the base for storage; a retractable cord is almost a necessity with this design. The machine does have good suction and the metal parts will probably last forever, but if the floating capacity ever gives out it will be like dragging around a canon ball. We had to return it. We finally settled on a Panasonic MC-3920 which is tiny and lightweight and does a good job on our hard-finish floors. For carpets we use a Eureka upright."
2,"Cool in theory, but dumb in real life","Like others, we had one of these when I was a kid. It was fun to play with but miserable for vacuuming.Its suction is not impressive--too much of that 12 amps go into keeping the thing aloft (and scattering dust).Worse, the hovercraft action only works well on a perfectly flat (and preferably hard) floor. Too easily, the base gets hung up on any change of level--tile-to-carpet, wood-to-rug, its own cord--and, as often as not, the machine tips over. You either have to go back and free or right the thing, or--out of exasperation--drag it across the floor on its side. It isn't especially good about moving around furniture and gets hung up or tips over, which is especially annoying in small rooms.There's a good reason this design never took off."
4,Have patience,"Just got the Hoover Constellation, mainly for the floors and dusting. Love the little guy, but agree about the cord winding problem. Figured it out! Turn it off, tilt the canister on its side and it'll wind around in no time. Also takes patience learning to maneuver thresholds and it coming up behind you too fast on floors. The trick is to take advantage of the great length on the hose and not yank it too fast. Would appreciate ANY and ALL suggestions on use! Overall, it does what I want am quite happy with the product."
4,Hoover Constelation vacuum,"We had these cannister vacs years ago and I was looking for another because it floats and I do not have to keep pulling it behind me all the time I am cleaning my floors, etc."
2,Constellation,When we recieved the vacuum it was all scratched up. Overall it is a good vacuum. It wasn't worth returning for all the scratches.
1,Whack!,"No way, Bra!Tim and Eric is a whack rip off of the Jim and Derrick show, fool. Let me break it down for you, yo. Jim and Derrick be hella tight , yo. And stuff. Like hot chicks and hella mad whacks! Suck, swallow, release! Beahhtch! I saw Derrick Whipple in da flesh at Turbo Fuel Skatepark in Frisco, yo. He was doing mad tricks and hos, yo. That skit with the bunny and the honey had me cryin', yo. Fools always be tryin to git out of payin up, you know, yo. Bra. Anyway, I gotta run dawgs. I gotta go smoke outta my new pipe I just got for my 13th birfday. Me and my boy, tony, are gonna head down to brown town and find some herb and rolos. Peace, bra. Oh no you didn't! ha ha! Peace. You just got reviewed!"
1,It would be hard to get less for your money,"Least funny show ever. This is worse than the present day Saturday Night Live, which is awful. The skits just aren't funny."
5,Trying to get a hold of him for two weeks...,"Hi, Steve. I hope you read this. Have you talked to Jerry lately? I can't get a hold of him on the phone and I think he might have left to go out of town. He didn't tell anyone if he did, but his TV is on but I think he just left it on so no one would realize he really had left. If you see Janice, or Sherry, or Carmen, I need you to ask them to call me. They'll know why when you tell them. It's a really long story and I think a partially-nude, latex-fetish chatroom isn't probably the place to get into that. I'm... I'm just not ready. (heavy sigh)Anyway. Hope you enjoy those DVDs I sent you.Best regards,Carmine"
5,5 stars? Bump it up to 6,"5 stars doesn't even equate to the greatness that this show brings, I think it would be fair to say that we should remove the star system and leave it up to the masterminds at Cinco."
1,Why won't these guys go away?,"They aren't funny at all. They get the occasional good guest star for a cameo, but after 4 or 5 min. of these guys, I am bored and nauseous. I cannot for the life of my figure out who or what keeps these guys on the air on TV or on DVD. I can't stand them or their ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" show either!"
4,Another trippy outing from Tim and Eric!,"This is another great season for the Tim and Eric Show, Great Job! Mind you, that is if you like crazy, nonsensical, scary, and trippy images in your comedy show. Almost every character from the first season and some new ones appear over the episodes. Their are also some great guest appearances by other actors and comedians such as John C. Reilly as the know-it-all but really doesn't know anything Dr. Steve Brule and Zach Galifianakis as ""The Snuggler"". Another Great Job!"
5,Buy this DVD... For your Health!,"I don't even like wine, but guess what- you're gonna like it. SWEET BERRY WINE! You're supposed to spit it out, but no way Jose am I spittin' this stuff out, it tastes like fruit! Wine was invented by the Romans for orgies and orgies are not too much fun if no one wants to do it with you. Tell 'em how it tastes, Steve! All right, let's do it! There's all kinds of other wines, Peanut Nore, you got all different kinds, and that's all she wrote! I'm Dr. Steve Brule, for your wine.Please buy this DVD, and a backup copy just in case. In fact, this DVD is best viewed with an extra copy in each hand, so buy 3."
5,Excellent footage and interviews. A cautionary tale.,Very compelling. Great to watch with adult children; brings home the circumstances existing at the time in a way written material cannot. Combine with Angels in America (re: Roy Cohen) for even more context.Angels in America
5,"Puts Today's ""Newscasters"" To Shame!","Edward R. Murrow, unlike today's Media Meat Puppets, earned the world's respect via fair analysis of world events. This brilliant and historic DVD proves just that! Brave and unflagging, Murrow faced opposition from a dangerous source; Joe McCarthy during a sordid chapter in our history. So sad, that today's so-called newscasters lack the same courage to not only take on tough assignments, but to tell the truth."
5,McCarthy Years,An amazing revue into absolute power corrupting absolutely and one despot taking full advantage of period paranoia.Documentary can be slow but is still an amazing glimpse into and amazing period of American History and well worth seeing.
4,Stalin's War reveals the horror of the Soviet Union,As a WW II history buff I had never come across any data on the USSR except for the meetings with Churchill and Roosevelt. I have now changed my perspective after reading this book. Although nota primer anyone with a basic knowledge of WW II names and places is a suitable audience. This is not an accounting of the battles or any other detail. I had never known Stalin as the monster that he was. At times I found myself rooting for the Germans. Not because they were the good guys but because Stalin and companywere so much worse. What the Communist leaders did to their own military men to get them to fight is nearly unbelievable.You will also learn their mass murdering and butchering started long before the Germans. Read and you decide.
1,Avoid,"Prospective purchasers should note that the publisher, Theses & Dissertations Press, is an anti-Semitic Holocaust revisionist publishing firm."
1,Good for showing how pathetic humanity is.,"The Nazis and Stalinists are like two tribes of psychopathic monkeys, jumping up and down and pointing at the other side screaming ""They're even worse than us."" This book presents the official line of the nazi monkeys. It's interesting in the sense that the old WW2 propaganda battle is still going strong in some quarters."
4,A good mystery,I would give it a 3 1/2 star if that were available. I really enjoyed reading the story. It is one of those books where the ending saves the book (whereas for some books the ending kills the book) I thought it was well told. A mysterious woman tells Celia the man she is about to marry is a serial killer and she runs for her life onto a boat and into a terrible storm. She becomes shipwrecked on an island with two men and a house keeper all with secrets of their own.
2,Didn't seem to reach its potential ....,"The Bride's Rescuer by Charlotte DouglasHarlequin Intrigue # 691 - December 2002Celia's about to walk down the aisle when a mysterious woman tells her an amazing story. Celia can't face the groom so she leaves him in his tuxedo at the yacht club. Sailing away in her father's boat, a storm over takes her, throwing her into the sea. Cameron's been living as a recluse on his island for 6 years and he's not pleased at all when Celia washes up on his beach. He can't let her leave for fear she'll reveal his whereabouts, but he can't let her stay either for fear of his heart.I thought the story line was excellent, though for some reason the book didn't seem to reach its potential. I did enjoy it though."
2,From Back Cover,"Unconscious and wearing a torn wedding dress, Celia Stevens washed up on the shores of Solitare and threw Cameron Alexander's peaceful seclusion into complete chaos. Not only did her presence force him to reecamin his reasons for hiding out, but within days the walls around Cameron's hardenedheart slowly began to crumble...Celia sensed her enigmatic captor has a dangerous past, one she'd be better off not learning. And yet, it was Cameron's tough exterior as well as his tortured sould that made Celia long to spend a lifetime wrapped in his arms. But just as a future together looked possible, the evil that Cameron had feared for six years reared its ugly head, threatening the dreams they had dared to dream..."
3,Playing Games,"Who needs a love that only brings hurt, sadness, pain and sorrow? Where are the joy, excitement, smiles, giggles, fun and love? Not in ARE YOU SATISFIED, YET? by M. Bridges.Betty Jean , Ezekiel Johnson, (Zeke) and Carla are running on the same track, in the same lane, at the same speed with no reguards to any one but thenselves. Each one of them is so concerned about what they want, who hurt them, and I can not believe he or she did that to me.Not being a selfish person, I could garner no love, repect , nor feelings of sympathy for the main characters. At one point I was so disgusted with Carla, Betty Jean and Zeke, I put the book down. The secondary characters Sheila and Thomas were the strong ones who showed feelings for others and live in th real world.A superbly written book ARE YOU SATISFIED, YET is the first in a series of books about Betty Jean. I hope in the return of Betty Jean in GETTING UP AND GETTING ON, Betty Jean becomes a character that can be identified with."
5,"are you satisfied, yet?","this book is a must read for all women. betty-jean learn what all women should learn when your, fed up with crap, you are fed up. move out and move on. Men should read it and understand that like the old saying go, you don't miss your well till it run dry. very good book"
4,A Page Turner,This was a very good debut novel -0 Kept the reader interested. Waiting for the sequel
3,+1/2 Little-known pop vocals-era big band,"These late '40s, early '50s transcript recordings, made for Standard Radio Transcription Sevices, are a perfect snapshot of the searching, experimental efforts of the big band scene as it groped its way into the pop vocals era. Gray was a former arranger in the Artie Shaw and Glenn Miller bands, and many of these tunes nakedly refashion the old Miller sound -- big, muscular, melodic juggernauts, with an added brassiness that reflected the toughened machismo of the '50s arrangers. There are also some goofy, glitzy, softer tunes that feel more like movie music or show tunes, as well as several vocal numbers, featuring Tommy Traynor and the Crew Chiefs. It's the vocal tracks that save this disc for me, as well as the quaint spoken introductions that speckle the disc. For the most part this set is too brusque and too square for me -- more like Ray Anthony or Stan Kenton than Benny Goodman -- but there are some sweet moments worth checking out."
1,don't bother,Listen I'm not the first person to complain the focusing adjustment has lots of play in it. It's really aggravating to get it in focus. They look nice but perform awful. The left eye on the one I got was unable to be fully focused. I'm not sure if that was just my set. I sent them back.
2,Double Vision,I bought these binoculars for use at work. When I first used them I found that everything I viewed through them was in double as if each side was slightly off set from the other. I tried to adjust the focus hoping that would fix the issue but it did not. The size of these binoculars are perfect for carrying around but unfortunately they seem to be poor quality.
2,Not the best fit,Not the best fit but at least it does the job. I just didn't like the gap above the deck. Fixed this problem by spray painting the sleave with flat black paint.
3,not made from better material,service was excellent from order to receipt and i would order from seller in future. more cotton?
3,"Cool shirt.. Not bad..Decent, but not Great","I am wearing this shirt as I write this review. The shirt is sort of thin, and to me runs 1/2 a size small or I possibly run 1/2 a size large :). The producer of the shirt was looking for a vintage feel and does ok at achieving that. If you look closely you can see the missing pieces are printed to look worn and faded.. Nice idea, but sort of falls short...Not horrible, not great either.Good shirt to wear under your faded Field coat or to show off your military service..."
5,Great product and prompt delivery!,"It's a great gift for someone whose parent or grandparent served in the Army Air Force (or for the person who served). Nice quality, too."
2,Not that cool,"T/shirt sleeves way too big for a small, length of tshirt way too long as well. Fits terrible! Good for a super tall skinny person with big arms.."
3,sleeves too large,"Overall not too happy about the purchase. The quality is good, but the sleeves are too big in comparison to the rest of the body...the pic looks better than the actual shirt."
4,Yummy,"Bought this for my daughter to use tanning. She loves it. Smells nice and is super moisturizing. She won't go tanning without it! Also, much cheaper than what the salon sells."
4,good CD but could be cheaper,"This CD has all the songs from the TV show, but also has several from artists other than Hannah/Miley that I'd never heard before. Some of those I don't like as much. I'm glad I have it, but now that I know what's on it, I think the price could be lower."
4,True to form Hannah,I bought this sound track w/ DVD for my daughters 6th birthday. She LOVES it! I find myself dancing around to it whenever it is being played (which is alot). I think any girl who loves Hannah Montana will love this cd/dvd combo.
3,Solid pop songs that any kid would enjoy.,"I'm not a particularly big fan of Miley Cirus, but kids seem to love her. Even my kin have taken a liking to her. She doesn't have a spectacular voice, but I would accredit her on the fact that hers is much more impressive than many other teeny boppers of today, like Vanessa Hudgens for example. I would recommend this CD for young children who love Disney Channel or Hannah Montana, that's all folks."
5,BEST CD EVER!,"This is the best cd ever!I mean, It's soooooooooooo cheap for cd and dvd!I just got it today(the day it came out) and I just finished watching the dvd, 5 music videos!And the cd, she does great!I recamend this to EVERY ONE!Miley Cyrus ROCKS!She gets her talent from her dad!(Billy Ray Cyrus)And track 13, she sings with her dad!I LUV MILEY!"
3,One Vietnam Veteran's journey to healing.,"Reading Veterans will find much to think about in this novel from a different time & a different America. What Daniel Schubert has to work out is mirrored in many a Veteran's life.PERSONAL WARS is based upon Richard Siebert, MD's own memories of his tour of duty as a military doctor in the Vietnamese Highlands, & he ncludes several of his own illustrations, which add authenticity to his novel. While an important addition to the library of fictional personal journeys, it did seem to go on for ever."
5,Real Jewelry Making Techniques Book,"This is the book I looked for. It has large color photos and detailed step-by-step instructions. It is not only for beginners but also covers challenging techniques. Although the book concentrates on making techniques, it gives very nice examples to apply the techniques."
1,Not much use,"This is one of those books that promises a lot but fails to deliver: The procedures are incomplete; with missing steps and vague descriptions. There are lots of photos, but many of them are too small to clearly demonstrate what's being done. Beginners -- even intermediate jewelers -- will have a hard time puzzling their way through the instructions, and experienced jewelers will find nothing new or useful here. There are many well-written, helpful jewelry-making books out there. This isn't one of them."
2,The world's best _______ is back for more,"Kathleen O'Reilly Haley Taylor is back for more hot nookie and swordplay on the high seas. Like the first book, there's not exactly anything shocking or surprising here: just from reading the back cover teaser you can easily (and correctly) surmise that Captain Reed is not dead and has taken on a lover in his wife's year-long absence from his life. Truthfully, I found the story from the point Reed and Kathleen are reunited to be a little more than boring: it's a rehash of the first book. He's a total *** and slowly comes to the realization that he loves Kathleen more than anything. This ephiphany apparently neatly wraps up over 100 pages of acrimony in about 5 pages.Still, the book was engrossing enough to finish. I think the first book is better, though."
3,Watch the cables,"The price on this Coleman line is decent; it doesn't seem to get as many positive reviews as other inverters. I was having trouble with mine powering some power tools off my truck's 12v batt, tools in the 7-8Amp range (900-960 watts). The alarm would go off and the unit would shut down. I was sure the inverter was a dud until I started experimenting with the cables. I ended up using the biggest, fattest cable I could find to connect it to the battery--and keeping it as short of a cable run as possible--and that solved the problem. The 13.5A (1620watt) circular saw still wouldn't work, but it isn't fair to expect that from a unit rated at only 1000watts continuous. If you're triggering that alarm frequently, upgrade to the heaviest gauge cable you can and see if that does the trick..."
1,Disappointing,"Almost all of the content of this book is explained in much greater detail in any good text on cell biology. Readers who are familiar with that content and expecting something new about ""bionanotechnology"" will be disappointed. Readers who are not familiar with that content will be mystified by the poor summary. The acclaimed artwork is not very helpful at all. This book is way too expensive for what the reader gets in return."
4,Outer Limits Companion,This volume is a treasury of info on the classic 60's show. Some of the background info is abit boring. More details on the newer series could have been included. The book is a great deal and is a great companion to the DVD sets.
3,"interesting, bu not much more","The basic idea is great: play zappa on early instruments. Some numbners are extremely effective. Overall, however, the result does not live up to expectations. An excesive use of the harpsichord (which was very present in early zappa) tends to spoil the idea and make it routine ...."
3,"WARNING - all words, no pictures","Dang, I thought this was going to be an instructional book on how Robert Genn paints. Nope, just a discussion. A very interesting discussion, but no pictures."
4,"A Little Strange, but entertaining","I bought this book as a result of receiving Robert Genn's newsletters, which I love. The book was okay, but a little random and disjointed. Genn made it good - his workshop audience did not. I think better editing of the material would have helped. I am looking forward to Genn just writing a book himself, without a workshop format."
5,Great Product,"Buy this product as a gift for my sister and has given much use on the beach and pool, you think of great"
1,"Every Drop For Sale, a ""colorful"" novel","I was prepared to like this book and be convinced of its premise, but was sorely disappointed. It is mostly undocumented and seems to reflect only the author's opinion.I call it a ""colorful"" read since the writing consists of yellow journalism, purple prose, and white lies.I compared it most unfavorably with ""A River Lost"" a wonderfully researched and well written book on the Columbia River. Mr. Rothfeder simply pushes his own ideas and bends the facts to fit his views."
2,little empirical data,"very few statistics or physical information cited.Instead, author constantly uses turns of phrase like ""drastically reduced flow"" or ""substantially curbed drinking supply"" while providing little of the numbers which should come rushing forth to defend his premise.I checked this book out from the library expecting compelling documentation of the perils of water privatization, instead the book is a meandering attempt at a poetic defense of the public claim to water- a message with which I agree but for I find little justification in this book. It does contain a number of at least entertaining anecdotes and some worthwhile philosophizing on the problem of over-development, it might serve as a good general introduction to the genre of books bashing corporate and private malefeasance, and therefore make okay reading on a plane, as it's not very demanding reading."
2,Kind Of A Slow Moving SHTF Novel.,"The title for this says it all.I guess it's worth it to buy it if you have everything else on the subject, but it's not that great and I wouldn't expect too much out of it.If there were more books on the subject then I'd just say to skip it altogether.It's predictable and it follows a set pattern.If you can get it for cheap, then get it.If not, then don't buy it."
4,A good read,"A good story packed with survival ideas and skills. Heiser approached the issue of catastrophic failure of government following a terrorist act from a different angle from some other similar books. His heroes are far from perfect, and have problems and foibles of their own. And yet, in the end, they turn out to be the type of leader that was needed all along. A good read."
3,Good story but could have used a professional editor.,The story was good and flowed well but the book certainly could have used a professional editor to take care of the spelling and grammatical errors.
5,Quest Into Libary Island!!!!!,"Negi is once again put to the test as he must rush the 2A class into studing (normally they wouldnt ever do work!) and if they fail a test to see what grade group is the smartest, that means no job for Negi! Fun and detailed graphic novel! I thought this book was exciting and funny. I liked this novel the best of the first three Negimas so far! Have fun!"
1,Rubber Stamp Carving,"I was very dissappointed with the product condition. It looked fine on the surface but when I opened all the pages they had been wet sometime in the book's history and they were stuck together. Some came apart fairly easily, others didn't come apart at all. It was almost a useless purchase."
1,Not very helpful,"I should have been suspicious when I saw that the ""book"" was really a ring bound notebook about 1/4"" thick. The information inside was of similar quality. The author told me little more than books and articles that provide tips for buying automobiles. One of the most elusive pieces of information, when shopping for an RV, is the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price and the price of individual options. Many dealers and manufacturers are reluctant to provide this data or do not provide it at all. And how accurate is the MSRP when is is available? The author never addresses these issues. What about add-ons, such as dealer prep and other miscellaneous fees. Are these legitimate fees? The author does not say. For me, this book was useless."
2,The RV Buyers Survival Guide,"I purchased this book expecting to be enlightened. I am an accomplished vehicle buyer and wanted basic facts on RV pricing. The book has some good information, if you never bought a car or RV before, but cost figures are generic. The quality of the book was poor (basically copier pages, not all printed straight, with a plastic binding. Not worth the price .... I guess it would be OK is it was the only game in town. A better buy is ""How to Buy an RV and Save"" by Don Wright. ..."
3,RV Buyers guide misses target,This guide missed the mark by not providing enough detail to allow a purchaser to identify the bottom line price of a new RV.
2,The RV Buyers Survival Guide,"I found the book overpriced for the value received. After buying and reading the book, I discussed with a friend who is also shopping for an RV. He purchased a similar book, with the same number of pages and content, for less than 1/2 the cover price. I found 2/3rd's of the book ""fluff"" and common sense, with 1/3 of marginal value."
3,RV buyer's survival guide 3rd edition,This book had a lot of info for buying a new RV but I was in the market to buy a used one so this book was not helpful to me. They talked about hagling strategies for when you purchase a rig which I thought is helpful.
5,Mean fairies can be interesting.,"There is something interesting about a fairy with attitude. Vidia is not one of the nicest fairies but she is still interesting. In fact she seems to make an appearance in every book. Also, Vidia's conflict with the Queen sort of humorous. This was a good mini quest."
4,Perfect for Girls Seven to ???,"Girls who read voraciously often run out of books that are adventurous and not 'edgy', but this series will keep them going for quite a while! Color pictures, large print, short chapters, bright white paper all combine to make these titles easy on the eyes, attractive to the reader. Also try Trouble With Tink, Lily's Pesky Plant and Beck and the Great Berry Battle."
4,Blues as it was meant to be played,"These guys know what they're doing and their songwriting is outstanding. If only Kid Jonny Lang was old enough to understand what they're saying on this record he might be able to emulate their sound. I wish more people listened to real music like this. Kid Rock it ain't--this stuff's legitimate. And if you ever need some refreshment when you're checking these guys out at finer establishments all across the upper midwest, reach for an ice-cold Summit beer--the bass player bottles the stuff during the daytime and boy is it good! Later."
5,Two in a Row,"Bravo Mr. Paolicelli. You've penned another great, informative, unique book on Italy that too few will discover and savor.If you want to learn about the other Italy, as well as its gift to the United States through generations of creative imigrants who brought not only their talents, but their values as well, this is the book for you.Paolicelli's writing continues to be wonderful (as it was in Dances), his research thorough, and his point of view unprecedented. Those who have journeyed to Southern Italy will want to go back with a fresh set of eyes; those who haven't been will be changing their itinerary to include a southern swing."
2,Where is Abruzzo????,"Mr Paolicelli needs to understand the geographical location and history of Italy before he ventures to write another book on the subject. Although, the region of Abruzzo has had political connections to the South of Italy, its location is in the CENTRAL PART OF ITALY. In fact Abruzzo during and after WWII has has had stronger ties to the North and Central part of Italy then the South. Thank You."
2,Good... but be warned!,"This is quite an amazing rhyming dictionary. My only problem with it is that it's based on British English pronunciations. While most words are pronounced similarly between the Brits and the Yanks, it can be very frustrating to have to sift through the results and the entries themselves to find the rhymes that match our pronunciations. Ultimately, I plan to replace this one with something more... American."
5,Rhyme Time Is not Scary with this Dictionary,"Of the many rhymning dictioaries I own, The Oxford is among the best.Not only end rhymes with one or two-syllables, but a decmil system for finding words with three syllables and beyond that rhyme.A flexibility aiding the aspiring poet and more than that:It is literally at my right hand during times of creativity. A definitenecessary writer's tool.Oxford Rhyming Dictionary"
3,Dz,Great value. I would buy again for a friend that wants a vintage Marlin shirt.Size. Color and logo was accurate.
2,Don't Be Fooled By The Speed Limit title,"A word of caution: if you are expecting the Drum N Bass/Jungle/Breakbeat type of music you have come to expect from the Speed Limit 140 BPM+ volumes, you will be extremely disappointed, as I am. Moonshine should have done better than this. The entire CD is Hard House. It's good if you like House. Moonshine should not have put this music under this title. I seriously doubt if any of these songs ever get over 120 bpms."
5,Bob the Builder jigsaw puzzle,"The grandchildren just loved this puzzle....... enough pieces for the 4 yr old to allow her 7 yr old brothers help her a little bit......excellent colors, cardboard..........loved it"
3,Accurate saw with some minor nuisances,"I found the Makita LS1221 to be very accurate and powerful. The miter table to the base were near perfect alignment and the fences were very square to the table. The saw is in no way flimsy. Adjusting the bevel and the miter angles are fairly easy. The miter gage is very easy to read. The bevel gage however does not offer enough contrast, especially after the smallest amount of saw dust gathers on it. The lever for locking the bevel gage should be in the front of the saw. The motor makes an annoying sound when it is first started and is positioned directly on the right side of the saw making it difficult to see what you are cutting as the cut proceeds through the wood. Changing the blade is very difficult because there is no way to support the blade fence out of the way to clear the arbor nut.This however, should not be a problem for anyone who has three hands."
5,"MIKITA 12"" COMPOUND MITRE SAW","First saw arrived with a cracked base. I found this a bit shocking since it was very solidly built. I attributed this to a lousy packing job which could not tolerate a drop from a truck ( I assume this happened)....Replacement was fast and no hassle -LOVE AMAZON !!! SAW IS INCREDIBLE...cuts wood like butter, accurate scale of degrees, easy to adjust, heavy but not too heavy to move to site of cutting. Manual is not detailed enought you will need to get a wood trim book.All in All a great saw and great value....David - Interior Designer"
3,not bad but could be better,"The language is a bit weird, like that of the 18th or 19th century European travellers. The information is sufficient but is not as academic as one would expect, if you are looking for a scholarly source.However, the visual part (pictures, figures) is very extensive and helpful."
2,Beautiful drawings,"This book has beautiful drawings, however, there are no photos in this book so we can't tell what is the artist's assumtion and what isn't. It's like having something third-hand. Someone made an outfit, an artist drew or painted it, the author drew it, and now I'm trying to interpret what the original garment looked like.I really loved some of the ideas I got from this book, however, I don't know how accurate it is."
3,Pretty fun & believable...,"...but if you want a good lesbian book that will absorb you into someone else's life and make you feel something, try Bett Williams' _Girl Walking Backwards_ instead. I read this one quickly but it didn't really stay with me. I thought from the reviews here that it would be better than it was."
3,ok,It was an okay book i thought it could of had a better endingBut overall okay i wouldn't re read though
5,Heatwarming and eye openeing,Dare Truth Or Promise took be no mroe than 2 days to read...I couldnt put it down. It touched me on so many levels; through the two girls meeting to their falling in love to every other aspect of the book. It was beautifully written and had me either smilijng or in tears for most of it depending on the part. well worht the money and deffinatly worth the time to read.
2,So bad,I can't believed this book got so many good reviews.....the story development is very confusing....the auditing is awful.....honestly try to borrow a copy...don't wast your money....If u want to read a well written story about the awakening to true love try hearts n flowers border by L. T Smith...u will love it!
4,Non-linear murder story dredges up buried skeletons,"I liked this novel a lot. An American documentary film-maker goes to the Republic of Ireland on a project, and unwittingly steps on a rake, as his subject matter and associates have ties to events in early 20th C Ireland. The plot lines weave and swoop in different times, and it all builds to a climactic closing. You should check this out."
2,Did not work,"Taste ok, but doesnt not work if you want to use it for slimming. However dont mind the taste, just for the sake of drinking healthy tea."
2,"Don't be fooled, its just plain tea, not very good at that","I bought this for the Blueberry, not for the ""slim"" claim. If it is supposed to do anything to your appetite it did not do anything to change mine. It just isn't very flavorful tea, especially if you are looking for blueberry. I can't tell what it tastes like and I drink tea twice a day."
2,Not their best!,"I love blueberries, green tea and Yogi Teas but I do not like this! It has an orange spice taste up front like the only flavored tea around when I was a kid, didn't like it then, don't like it now. Then it finishes with a Stevia after taste! Yuck. I like my teas plain and would prefer to add my own sweetener if I feel it's needed. This is a miss in my book and it's not surprising when the ingredients list 'natural orange flavor' before 'natural blueberry flavor' in the line up. Why not something more natural like actual blueberry? Right? Silly me. It doesn't taste like a berry of any kind by my standards. So, if berry and green tea are the taste you're looking for AND you like the multifaceted herbal taste of Yogi brand teas then try their Goji Berry instead, it's wonderful w/ no weird sweetener after taste and no orange spice! Goji Berry is 5 stars in my book!"
2,WOW,"My Doctor told me to drink this green tea for weight lost. It was hard to find and when you did it cost at least $5.50. Being as I have used amazon for other purchases I checked on my tea, Wow less than $3.00 a box, and it comes every month to my door."
5,Super Yummy,"I bought this tea because I really wanted to try a green tea and was afraid I wouldn't like the taste. Blueberry sounded good, so I picked it up. I've bought at least 10 boxes since! It's wonderful...very flavorful without being overpowering or too sweet. I even like to steep it and drink it room temperature. I gave some to my mother when she was over and now she's hooked. Very recommended"
5,Excellent green tea with a hint of blueberry!,"Yogi tea is an excellent purchase and enjoyable tea for this price range. The blueberry slim and kombucha quickly became my favorite flavors to date.As for this specific tea, it is your standard green tea but with a hint of blueberry. The water actually turns to a purple/blue tint, and the aroma itself is delicious. The aftertaste is a mild fruitful blueberry taste. If you are looking for the benefits of green tea but with an interesting change of things, I highly suggest you give this flavor a try."
3,everyone has a different taste...,It wasn't for me..i should have bought a single box and tried it first but i saw so many great reviews that i just jumped on it...and when i tried it i just disliked the flavor so much...it really reminded me of the herbalife tea the raspberry one.it leaves an after flavor in my mouth kinda like a splenda sugar would..anyways my sister and my friend loved it...the flavor and they said it works good to keep their cravings under control..it just wasn't for me. but i recomend you buy the single box first if its your first time!
5,So delicious!,"This tea is absolutely delicious - I'm so glad I ordered more than one box! At first, I was surprised when I opened the package and there were six boxes of teabags, because I thought I'd ordered just one - but now I'm glad I have a bigger supply! This tea tastes so, so good - even my boyfriend, who usually hates green tea, keeps asking me to make this tea. I boil it in my teapot according the instructions, then let it cool off, and stick it in the fridge. Sometimes I'll add half a lemon as well for extra flavor. It's so refreshing when it's cold!! I'd recommend this tea to anyone!"
4,Yumm-O!,"I love the taste of this. It's the only tea that I've been able to drink without honey. The lingering blueberry flavor is delicious! I'm not sold on it as an appetite suppressant though. That effect doesn't really come till after the second cup of tea, and there are just other things I'd rather be drinking. Still, it's a very delighful green tea."
5,Really works!,"Delicious and effective! I have a job where I often have to go a couple of hours past mealtime without food. Drinking this tea beforehand, I don't even notice it's dinnertime!"
5,Our Favorite Tea,"This is the most delicious green tea ever! We like to make big brews of it and then chill it in pitchers and drink it cold. I love the subtle hint of blueberry. It's not going to make you lose weight, though.. come on now, it's just tea. It might increase your metabolism a little because it has some herbs and caffeine in it, but it's not a miracle, people! There's no such thing."
5,One of my favorite Yogi teas!,"I was initially skeptical about a blueberry-flavored tea, as I've had some in the past by other brands that just tasted odd to me. This one's a keeper though! I can't personally vouch for it's ""slimming"" abilities, but I do know it's a great tea to kick off your day with, just the right amount of caffeine, the flavor is just right, and doesn't need any added sweetener. Even if you do overbrew, it doesn't get bitter like other green teas. Amazon has the best price I've found anywhere for Yogi teas."
2,Did not feel energized...,I was soooo excited to get this as I have morning classes as 8 in the morning...but after I brewed an full cup with 2 tea bags I did not feel energized at all!!! As a matter of fact I felt drossy...It does have a pretty good taste though...
5,It really works,"This tea not only helps control my appetite but helps me to bounce around all day with out getting tired. I just drink two cups a day , because it is all I need. It tastes good too. I am 82 years old and have been drinking this tea for many years now."
5,"taste great,stilling waiting for the effect","taste great, don't know about the effect yet. It may take a month to see if I can lose weight. Still waiting"
4,DELICIOUS TEA - BUT NOT FOR WEIGHT LOSS.,"I finished my 1st box this week and let me just say ... This is by far one of my MOST favorite teas. The flavor is extravagant !! Its very light and is very tasty -- not too sweet.If your looking for weight-loss tea, this is a no-go but its still worth buying because it tastes so good.Great deal for the amount you receive !"
4,A Nice Way to Relax During the Day,A cup of Yogi green tea is a great way to take a break during the day and just take a moment to relax. The blueberry tea is supposed to help with detoxing your body (which is essential to a healthy inside and outside) and it helps give you energy so you will feel invigorated when you are working out (be it at the gym or yoga studio).In a word: Yum! A delicious tea to enjoy anytime :)
2,I Really Wanted to Like this Tea :-(,"I love all kinds of teas, I drink some every day. I saw that so many people like this blueberry variety, so I decided to try it. I am a big believer in the ""groupthink"" of customer reviews. And I am rarely disappointed in anything Amazon. I didn't see that stevia is an ingredient. Stevia creates a very bitter taste in my mouth. So I will be sharing this shipment with my friends who don't mind stevia. I'm going to look at other Yogi teas and check on the ingredients closely."
5,Wonderful show for everyone,"Secret Garden is a wonderful show for the entire family. Rebecca Luker, Daisy Egan and Mandy Patinkin give amazing performances on this CD. I've seen the Broadway production and two local productions of the show and have been blown away by each production in a different way. Rebecca Luker's voice in both the Broadway production and on this album is just wonderful. Her crystaline soprano just sends chills down my back everytime I hear her singing that opening. Her duet with Patinkin on ""How could I know"" is just absolutely heart breaking. Get this CD!!!!"
5,Secret Garden is Fantastic,"This musical is one of my very favourites and I highly reccommend this recording both to lovers of the show or anyone looking to enjoy a new musical. The song selection provides a good picture of the story, with several bits of scenes and libretto. Beautiful cd."
5,fantastic CD,"Even though this is a cast recording from the 90's,it's absolutely wonderful. I love it and play it a lot.After I bought mine, I lent it to my sister who asked me if Icould order 2 for her, because she wants to give one as a gift.I highly recommend it to everyone."
3,Alright...eh,"Although Rebecca Luker is fabulous ()as usual) that's about it. The music is so-so, and the rest of the cast is alright. Daisy Eagan is a great actress, although i'm not sure she deserved that tony. The boy who plays Colin for the most part is too breathy, and dickon sounds mor elike a grown man than a boy. The boy who sings Lift Me Up would be great if he didn't have to go so high. But, at least he was allowed to be on the cd. He was the original Colin, but his voice started to change, so the othe rboy took over. But, the director allowed the original boy to sing one song on the cd...which is VERY nice!!!!! I would recommend previewing this cd before buying it."
1,Just awful,"Lousy musicals like this is why Broadway keeps having revivals, because, quite frankly, the worst song in a classic musical like ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Cabaret"" or any Rodgers/Hammerstein musical is far better than any tune in this dreary show, which consists of atonal songs with mostly banal lyrics. I defy anyone to find anything in here that's remotely hummable.Many of the performers have excellent voices, but even talented singers like Mandy Patinkin will fall short if he's got nothing to work with. And there's nothing here.If this musical deserves 4 or 5 stars, ask yourself why no one has given the composer and lyricist another crack at a Broadway show. Once was more than enough."
3,A charming cast recording,"I listened to this album after hearing the London cast. The best part about this album is that lots of the dialogue is intact. The singing is superb, unfortunately some of the actors have a problem with the Yorkshire accent and it sounds forced. Saying that it's a great addition to any collection of musicals, but buy the new London cast album too."
3,Artists Outshine Material,"This was my favorite book as a child and I had some trepidation when I saw the show. It was more fun than I imagined and a friend bought the CD for me. I have to say that every voice is a delight: particularly Mandy Patinkin (Lily's Eyes), although I think the actual music is a bit simple. It takes voices as good as these to keep you interested after the first time or two. The women shine, Daisy is a delight, and Mandy is always the best in any musical project. I would say if you like Andrew Lloyd Webber better than Sondheim, this is for you. Upbeat but tender: a nice listen."
3,Australian Recording Better,"The professional Australian recording of ""The Secret Garden"" (Polydor 1995) though featuring highlights of the show, allows the leading two men, Phillip Quast (recently seen in Melbourne Theatre Company's production of ""The Goat, or Who is Syliva?"" by Edward Albee) and Anthony Warlow to capably shine. The watery role of Lily is portrayed by the divine Marina Prior (recently seen in ""Noises Off"" at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne).As part of an Australian tour, the production played to capacity in Melbourne at the State Theatre, Victorian Arts Centre."
5,The Secret Garden on CD,"While the music from The Secret Garden is not of the variety that you'll leave the theater singing, it is a truly moving experience to see the show and listen to the music over and over on CD. It's one of those Broadway shows you'll want to listen to repeatedly, each time discovering new revelations about the music."
5,This musical is magical!!,"I adore the musical ""The Secret Garden."" I cannot say enough good things about it. The music is so good it's almost... magic. It just sparkles. It wavers back and forth between heatbreaking (How Could I Ever Know) and joyful (Wick) and pretty much includes every emotion in between. The lyrics are unusally natural and easy. The performance of Mandy Patinkin is amazing (big surprise) and the rest of the performances are fantastic too. It is easily one of the best musicals ever written, and that's all I have to say."
4,One Fault,"That fault is the utterly disturbing operatic vocal talents of Mandy Patinkin. He is a wonderful performer, but for some reason I prefer Anthony Warlow ( Australian Cast ) to him. Oh well, get it anyway. Great score."
4,Very good! I love this music!,"This is a very lovely musical with some beautiful songs in it. I very much like the singer of Archibald, Lily, Mary, and Neville! Beautiful acting, singing and music! I have to say that Dickon gets on my nerves a lot, (maybe something about the accent?) but most of the singers I like. I would suggest this one for any musicals lover."
2,NOT for kids,"Yes, this book is amusing. Yes, the art is entertaining. Yes, I enjoyed it. If I were rating it for an older child (13+) or an adult, I probably would've given it four stars.The reason I gave it two stars is because it is wholly inappropriate for its intended audience. The book is dripping with sarcasm, rudeness and for a children's book, it's pretty darned impertinent.What really convinced me not to allow my 4-year old to have this book (after I purchased it at a going out of business sale with no returns) was the story entitled, ""Henry's Bedtime Story."" If you want your children to have the fear of God instilled in them, by all means, read them this portion of the book. It begins, ""...do you know the story of the MONSTER who comes to STEAL little children in the night?""This book is amusing- for the 13- and older crowed. Don't buy this for a young child. I feel safe in saying you'll likely regret it."
2,disappointed,"I don't like this book. I ordered it based on customers' reviews and ended up giving it away to a book sale. Too bad. If you like ""Stinky Cheese Man"" you'll like this one. It's got a similar sense of humor. I see that sense of humor as a deadpan fascination with violence. The verbal style is flat ""Dick and Jane."" But this verbal spoof is purely for adults. What kid reads ""Dick and Jane"" any more? The visual style is cute: humans have round heads with smily faces. It's hip. It's nasty. Hip and nasty. A grown-up version might be early Brett Easton Ellis. Yuck."
1,A recipe for insolence and irony,"This is a funny book as a parody of dopey children's literature. But as a book for actual children, I find it pernicious. If you want your kids to be sassy, caustic and sarcastic, why not just let them watch a lot of television? This book will teach children that it is okay to be obnoxious."
5,This book is one that the whole family will love.,We have never read a funnier childrens book as this one. You and your whole family will laugh out loud together.
5,Lane Smith rules!,"My name is Carolyn Garcia, and I have a book coming out called Moonboy.Lane Smith is someone who has greatly inspired me and I think he is the best children's book illustrator/author out there."
5,The happy Hocky Family,"My grandson introduced this book to his mother (he got it from his school library) who in turn shared it with me. She and I laughed throughout the reading of it. I love this book and have purchased 4 of them for the grandchildren and then purchased The Happy Hocky Family Moves to the Country which is also hysterical. My family in other parts of the country are sick of me reading this book to them over the phone. Earlier this week grandson Henry, who is 5 years old and in kndergarten, read it to me by himself and also laughed. Kids need to read books that are fun, but that also have a more subtle sense of humor. Buy this one!"
1,Does NOT live up to it's title.,"The contents of this activity book do not live up to the title. Many are not ""on the go"" activities, let alone easy for little kids to follow without supervision. As a teacher, this proved to be a poor investment of my time and money. You would be best to not make the same mistake."
3,Misleading,"This Columbia CD says ""Best Of Big Bands"" , but that's a far cry from the truth. This is one of Miller's early bands where he was still searching and developing that special ""sound"" he wanted. The cd has some interesting music on it, but it does not contain any of Glenn's well known hit songs, which can be found on the RCA/BMG record label. This Columbia cd is primarily for Miller completists only."
1,Sucks!,"All though the actors were cast well, except for Nancy,the acting was ok, I hated this version of a classic Charles Dickens novel. There were too many liberites taken with the story line and the music was quite awful and distracting. I should have read more about the discription of who directed and produced this version. If you are a diehard Dickens fan you will be greatly disappointed with this film."
2,If only . . .,"The item ordered (Oliver Twist) was great. However, it is such a shame I am forced to order it from Amazon.com. If only there were a better user friendly service to deal with."
1,i have lost faith in WGBH productions...,...and i must admit that my view of the quality of the BBC brand is more than a bit tarnished by this version of Oliver Twist.
1,Did they read the book?,"The other reviewers have already listed some of the MANY liberties that this production has taken with Dickens' great work. Rather than elaborate, let me just say that it's what you might call the ""Oliver Stone version"" of Oliver Twist. Compared to many of Dickens' other works, Oliver Twist is not a particularly long or complex tale, and there's no excuse for the distortions and omissions in this latest Masterpiece Theater version. And as for casting the cheerful and enigmatic Spuds McKenzie as the evil Bullseye, gimme a break!"
1,Parts are specifically intended to put Christians in a bad light. IMO,I enjoyed this version up until the end when it was apparent that someone at the BBC specifically decided to portray Christians in a very poor light by adding dialog to the court scene and a jail scene that were not in the book. The Judge asks Fagan if he would like mercy. He then asks Fagan to accept Jesus as his Savior and Fagan says he cannot. So the Judge condemns him to death. No where in the book does this dialog exist.In an earlier scene the Dodger comes to visit Fagan and Fagan says the Jailors are feeding him bread soaked in Bacon. Again not in the book. Why add this kind of crap unless you have an agenda to denigrate Christians.
1,Aaaarrrrgggghhhh,"I'm wondering if the script writer read the novel. This was a mishmash of a story. I kept watching because I thought it would get better, but it didn't. The most stupid rewrite--the end of Bill Sykes. Dickens gave us a wonderfully ironic scene which was eliminated for one that was emotionally sterile.It's just bad."
1,This Movie Does Disservice to Charles Dickens' Work,"If you are expecting a recreation of Charles Dickens' classic story, you are in for a surprise! The screenwriter (Sarah Phelps?)almost created her own story while using the classic Oliver Twist as a template. Although bearing the same names, the characters in this movie were not ones created by Charles Dickens. They looked like someone born in the wrong century. It's bad! I wonder how such a script got made into a movie by BBC. There was no artistic value here. A total waste of public money!!!"
5,Laugh Hard at some Dark Comedy,"Puppets Who Kill is one of the greatest series to hit Canadian television. We were on a trip when we caught it on television. We looked it up and found season 1 & 2. If you like TV shows like South Park, or The Family Guy, you are right in step to like this one as well. It is irreverent, sadistic, and really off color, and I loved every minute of it. Must see for everyone over 18."
1,Absolutely Horrible and Out of Date,"I rented this video expecting it to be from 2010 since that was release date, most of the stuff in the video is from 2004. The guy talking in the video spends 5-10 minutes on extremely stupid stuff. He spent that much time right away showing us how to change the ""code"" to make the first letter in your sales page bigger than the rest of the text. I didn't even finish the video but at the rate he was going there would have been very few tips and the things he was showing were almost completely worthless in the present. I wish there was an index of all the points he was going to cover somewhere so I could have decided if I would have been interested, ie, ""Chapter 1: Increase first letter of your starting paragraph"""
1,Waste of money,I got sold on the subject and rented this - it was bad from the very beginning - I could not watch for more than 10 mins. Please do not waste money on this.
3,Not for aggressive chewers!,"I bought this for my basset-mix boy to replace a beloved ""fuzzy man"". I should have paid more attention to the dimensions, because it's WAY smaller than I anticipated...his old ""fuzzy man"" was twice the size of this guy! Anyway, he tore it apart in less than ten minutes. This toy is really more suitable for less aggressive chewers and probably more appropriate for toy/small dogs. It simply won't last long otherwise."
3,HUGE!,"I generally wear an XL as I am 6'3"". This sweatshirt SWALLOWED me and went down to my knees. I loved the feel and look of it, but I had to send it back. When I did, they no longer had any larges. I loved the sweatshirt, but the sizing is way off."
4,Tolerant and Adopted?,Where is tolerance? When he came back from England at the age of twenty-seven he had 285 slaves. In ten years the number grew to 386. And he and his father did not think twice about breaking up families.Where is adoption? His father is his father and his mother is his mother. He was a bastard but it took 27 years for his father to marry his mother although they lived together the entire time. Is that called an adoption?
3,Weird,This is a very weird work out. A lot of hair tossing. Very amusing if you're in for some entertainment.
2,A joke,"I was looking for more of a striptease workout than being entertained... I could only get through the first 10 min of Carmen close-ups, giggles and cutesy smirks. I found myself rolling my eyes far too much. I dunno, I may try it again, and see if I can get through it to focus on the actual routine."
2,The DVD Skipped after like 10 min,"I popped in the DVD and it started skipping over and over and eventually just turned off and went to the menu screen... The seller DID say that if it skipped he would refund it, but I feel like you would know if an item skipped and you shouldn't sell something if you know its busted... It only cost $5 total so I feel like sending it back would cost me more than just keeping it"
4,Great toning workout,"Overall, this DVD is fantastic for beginner to intermediate. (If you are already very toned, then this might be too easy for you.) It's a good mix of legs, abs, upper body, and rear end, with a little bit of cardio. I get the best results from the exercises for the rear and thighs. I'm working on making the abs section more difficult for myself because I don't usually feel sore in the midsection the next day. I supplement this with other cardio routines because there are only about 5-6 minutes of cardio at the beginning. The arms portion could be more difficult, but I sometimes add my own weights to get better results. I'm very happy with Michael's explanations of the exercises, and all of the moves are very safe. I usually do all five sections (about 55 minutes total) for a good full body toning workout."
5,Fun and Effective workout,"I had a baby recently and after dropping most of the weight I had gained, I needed to tone up. This is the BEST workout. It's really toning my body everywhere and tightening up my abdominal area (that whole ""love handle"" area) that became really soft during pregnancy. If you can commit to it, it is GREAT and takes under an hour to do!"
4,Good starting point,this series got me interested in working out ive since moved on to more advanced work and because i could do the whole video without watching it. I noticed that some people are have issues with routines 6-9 the reason why it goes back to warmup is because these ar compilations of the moves featured in routines 1-5 for example routine 7 is warmup/isolation upper body/isolation abs and routine 9 is warmup/floorwork hope this helps
5,Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip REALLY does make you fit!,I've tried my moms excersise videos from the 80's and they were nothing like this! I did the whole video last night and my leg muscles and belly are so sore... which means something worked. I recommend everyone to buy this video to get into shape! I LOVE IT!
2,not really worth the 50,it was kinda boring and the same stuff over and over.the moves werent that hard and didnt seem like much of a work out
3,Second Try,"To be honest, I'm going to give this a second try after I work out elsewhere first. However, as it now sits on my DVD shelf, I'll give it a partial review:Pros:1) I realized that even though I feel ridiculous, it can actually look ok.2) I've loosened up and enjoyed dancing for my boyfriend.Cons:1) I popped my neck wrong following her stretches. The other exercise program I use now says that stretching your neck back strains it. Great to know now.2) I wasn't flexible enough for the intro routine, so it was hard for me to understand how to do what she was showing. I gave up after the third thing that I didn't understand and she didn't explain."
4,Great workout video,This is a great workout DVD and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to workout and have fun too!
3,Not for the advanced...,"I've been working out for 4 years... most of that time with personal trainers. I bought the Carmen Electra series after a friend and I did the cardio hip hop disc one day just for fun. And that's what it was...fun. I do the Fit to Strip DVD on days when I don't feel like going to the gym or just need a quick workout. Because my fitness level is already a bit higher than someone not working out at all, I don't expect great results from the fit to strip dvd, but do enjoy it as an occasional break from the gym."
4,"Not enough, but good for what they are","I have 4 of the videos: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Of the four, I've only watched 1, 2, and 3.So far the first two are the best. In 1, the warm up is good and the two dances are really cute and easy to learn. The exercises in 2 are good, some I'd never seen before. Number 3 is ok, but a bit of a waste. All of these could have been put on 3 DVDs and been more full of information.I like that Carmen encourages you to make the dances ""yours"" and as I said, they're not terribly difficult. Maybe I was looking for more.An interview with Robin Antin the founder of the Pussycat Dolls and sister to Jonathan Antin of Blown Out is featured on #1 and an interview with the trainer is on #2.Enjoy."
3,3 DVDs of content on 5 DVD's,"I bought the set for my wife, and then watched then all. DVD 2 is a good workout even for men, the rest of them are basically for women. I was surprised to see how lacking in content some of the DVDs had. Some content was repeated from other DVD's too. If you are looking for a good workout - DVD 2 is the one to get and the only DVD that is packed with content. The others were more fluff such as learning one dance on DVD 5. DVD 4 is useful to learn the ins and outs of stripping. The set wasn't a very good value, because you think you're getting 5 DVD's, but it is really about 3 DVD's worth of content. There wasn't much variety."
5,Great DVD for those who want to be sexier,"I did this DVD last night for the first time and thought it was great. I really don't feel all that sensuous anymore and this was great with some beginner, basic steps to help you learn how to move in a sexy manner. It also left me sore in areas like my lower back. I work out and run and mountain bike but this DVD uses unusual muscles. I bought the second one too and can't wait to try that out (eventually.... after I can do the routines in the first DVD). Great for a woman that is so busy and distracted on a daily basis and does not have time to think about being sexy. I equivilate this DVD to a bubble bath but in the fitness aspect for a woman."
2,Disappointing,"The collection consists of 5 DVD's. The material on the DVD's is presented in a very clear, easy to learn manner. So people with two left feet can easily learn to do the routines. The first DVD teaches a warm-up routine. DVD's 3-5 each teach a different type of routine with the warm-up of DVD 1 repeated. My biggest complaint is that each routine on DVD is only 3-4 minutes long. So you have to perform it over and over in order to get any kind of benefit from the exercise. DVD 2 is the best of the group in my opinion because it has a very good exercise routine that is 30 minutes in length. It combines elements of Pilates, low-impact aerobics, and general body toning routines. There needs to be a single DVD with all the material on it. You cannot use a single DVD (with the exception of DVD 2) and expect to get a decent workout without constantly playing with your DVD player and replaying one of the chapters."
3,Good way to mix up workout,"I use this as a warm up before I hit the cardio machine at home. I think its fun and easy to do. I am not sure if I am getting much of a workout though. I would recommend this for fun and to add to a routine, but it is not enough to just do the video and expect a great sweat!"
4,Good workout,"The second video in the series is a good workout. I can feel it the next day. I haven't been doing it long enough to see any results, but it does work the muscles. It is also fun and easy to do. Each section has about 5 little workouts. You can do all of them or just pick and choose. I'd say it was worth getting."
5,TRUST ME IT WORKS!,"Wow, I've tried every workout every fab workout known to man and this has to be the greatest. Most workouts are filled with high energetic skinny people you just want to punch in their face, or workouts that just get too boring or make you go crazy (like billy blank's boot camp he just never shuts up). I loved this because even though Carmen is just following along I can look at her and be like, ""Move over, I'm about to have that body"" I've woken up with sore muscles that I never knew exsisted. I've been doing this for a while and OH MAN! I lost so many inches...my arms are so toned and my butt, wow, is just rock hard lol. I definitely recommend this. I know other reviewers have stated that there is not a high intensity factor but you don't need that for it to work. Do it everyday..it gets your body going..you'll be twsiting and turning and just having fun. I love every video. It just makes you feel sexy and like a woman no matter your age or weight."
3,A Workout My Husband Wants to Watch,"Never thought my husband would be joining me for my workout sessions! But let me answer that first thought of yours: when he watches, he's watching ME, not Carmen!Don't get me wrong, she's hot - even I can appreciate that. But while I'm moving and gyrating and working it as she instucts on this fun alternative workout, my hubby's watching MY bottom lose calories, tone-up and perfect moves I didn't even know I had in me!"
4,Striptease Aerobics,This video is not for the average person; unfortunately the workouts are not instructed like traditional workouts and you do have to be able to catchon pretty quickly. However I LOVE the workout with Carmen's trainer. He pushes you to really work your body to the max.
5,Kicks you,There is not dancing on here just aerobics which is great. I was impressed at how sore I am feeling. Good work out. The best part is that Carmen looks like shes in pain too as the instructor pushes her on.
3,Slow paced but fun,"I had hoped when purchasing this DVD that the workouts included would have a great aerobic benefit and add a little variety to my workout regimen. They are fun, but surely not aerobic. The routines are simple to learn (I have very little dance experience) but are very slow-paced. This is a fun addition to my workout regimen when I am bored of my regular workouts but is most definitely for a light workout day."
2,not what I was expecting,It came as advertised but I was expecting a few more dances and longer dances than the disc had on them. They were still fun to learn but I am glad I didn't buy these at full price else where.
2,Aerobic--uh I don't think so,"The title of this DVD makes it sound like it's something really advanced (and aerobic). But actually the first two DVDs in Carmen's set are much more physically challenging than this one. This DVD is kind of a cheesy joke. It consists of two 10 minute strip routines which require dressing up. The first one is a ""sexy librarian."" To do the routine as Carmen demonstrates you need some glasses and a scarf. The next routine is wearing men's clothing--a big button shirt, a tie, and a really stupid hat. Taking these items off is an integral part of the routine, although there is no actual nudity involved.The routines are too slow and short to actually count as aerobic. So this DVD is useful for one thing...learning some strip routines to act out for your significant other. Although I think I could make some up that wouldn't seem as embarassingly silly as parts of this DVD.I was looking for a fun dance routine that would get my heart pumping but this is definately not it!"
1,WHAT WAS I THINKING???,Why didn't I read the reviews before making this purchase? Carefully read the reviews below. Read very carefully. And unless you are a big Carmen Electra fanand want to see ANYTHING she does. Pass this one up.Zero% cardio. 100% boring
5,Love it!!!,"I love this workout, I liked it so well that I went out the day after the I bought the first one and bought the second one! She isn't trampy in this DVD, she is very professional through out the video. Before I couldn't stand her, now I am a new fan of her. I am not in shape what so ever and she makes even me feel great about my self! Thanks Carmen!!!"
2,Not really a workout,I am of average fitness and have done a few dancing classes - and I didn't find this to be much of a workout at all. I also found that Carmen doesn't always explain the moves properly and there is a lot of focus on her looking sexy but not a lot on teaching you the moves. I bought the discs separately but I really wish that I had purchased the box set because some of the discs' aren't worth it. It's fun to watch and it's not bad for you but not worth it if you are looking for an actual workout.
1,not a workout,"This dvd does not provide any kind of aerobic workout whatsoever, only a couple of short routines that I will never use. I was very disappointed."
4,Great for beginners,"As another reviewer mentioned, this DVD is more for dance beginners. If you're more experienced, you might want to try the other DVDs in her collection (I have the entire set of 5 and would reccomend those as well).Everything is done slowly and repeated often so that you can catch on and learn the routine quite quickly.I thought that the video might be a bit over-sexed, but was pleased to find that it wasn't. It is easy to feel sexy following the routines in this video and it's really fun."
5,WOW,"So the first one was fun and got my heart rate up to the target area, no problem! But this one...yikes! I just finished it and it is a really good workout, it starts out fast and fun, then slows down moves down to the floor to isolate certain problem areas. I like this set because it can fit into ANY time frame and leaves you wanting more, I was tired and just didn't want to stop. I know that there a lot more in the series but I am not sure where to get them, that may be the only let down to the set!!!"
4,"good workout, love the clock!","This workout was actually somewhat difficult, much to my surprise. My legs are wobbly from exertion, but not so much that I'm scared to do the workouts again. One really nice thing that no one else has mentioned is that there is a clock for each segment on the screen, counting down til the end of each set of routines. This makes the harder exercises easier to endure.All in all, I would reccomend this dvd (but, like others have warned, there is no actual dancing.) but get your own music once you are used to the sequence and moves. Even the music choices on here are repetitive and annoying after a short time. We all know what music motivates us, so use that instead of this canned stuff."
2,Jury's still out...,"Compared to Carmen's first installment in this series, Fit to Strip is slightly less of a disappointment. The workouts are decent, the ""quick fixes"" are definitely good since the fact that they're only 5 minutes long makes it easier to go through. However, some of the exercises repeat themselves and the ab exercises could be much more intense. One thing I did not like was the fact that the cardio warm up and legs workout were edited very badly and in some sections you're doing one exercise on one leg and then without notice you're finishing a set on the other leg. I don't know whether I like it or not, but I know I definitely don't love it."
5,Super Fun & Great Workout!,I love the workout! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun while working out!
2,Definately not a workout,"I tried these looking for a fun workout. I'm sad to say I didn't enjoy these at all. The only reason I gave it 2 verses 1 star is 1 star says you ""hated"" it, which just sounds so harsh...therefore, I'd give it 1.5 stars. Why? Well, I didn't get a good workout either aerobic or anerobic :-( and the ""stripdance"" aspect was weak and rather silly. I enjoy dancing and am comfortable with my sexuality, so it's not that. Basically, it didn't work as a workout video or dance video, so I'm not sure what it's good for :-(. If anything, it's good to give a single guy who wants to drool over Carmen Eletra and/or get a good laugh."
2,So so...,I run every other day and I was looking for something to do in-between running days. Carmen Electra's trainer gives you moves and tips throughout the whole DVD. This DVD just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't as intense as I had hoped. The moves are slow and brief. I'll probably pass it on to my mom since she's been looking to start a workout regimen herself.
5,Who would have thought?,This is a great workout dvd. I have been woking out reigiously for about 3 years now and this dvd was challenging. There are interesting ways that your body is used as resistance in this workout. I really enjoy it and find myself feeling stronger afterwards.
1,hated it,"shes not very camera friendly, and she wears ridiculous outfits, and overall i could not get into this dvd... went in the garage sale pile!"
2,Not what I was hoping,I was hoping this item would teach striptease moves. It only is a boring exercise video. I am getting rid of mine and I am very disappointed.
1,"Ok workout, Carmen is just too dumb","The workout is pretty good, but at times the camera show her doing the wrong thing or once, in the middle of the workout it pans to her just standing there, so it throws off your own count.To me it is just annoying and not worth my money"
2,what's this got to do with stripping?,"I am truely dispointed in this DVD. This is a plain, ok workout. It has absolutly nothing to do with any kind of dancing. And this is not a Carmen Electra DVD. Michael Carson is the instructor. Carmen is just there, doing the routine. The exercices are ok, especially for someone who is not in great shape, but this DVD will not show you anything that has to do with erotic dancing. This is just a workout."
1,i need an opinion!,"i just recently ordered the 5 disc set on the internet, i was reading some of the comments everyone wrote. i am about 30 pounds over weight and want to change it. did this work for anyone that wanted to loose weight? most of the comments i read it sounded like they were already in shape, was anyone not and this actually helped them loose pounds? please let me know, cause now i am starting to feel stupid by ordering this."
4,CARMEN can help mommies feel sexy again.,"I used to dance - ALL THE TIME, all styles, where ever I was, at any time! Now I have become a mommy and 2 years later, I barely have the energy to make it through the day with this toddler, much less pretty up and go dancing. SO when my little guy naps, I put on the dvd and dance again! It's great excercise (granted she's a bit cheesy on the video and you just have to laugh), and it taps into the woman inside you that still feels sexy and bring her out. Great fun!"
1,No NO NO,"This workout sucks. It is NOT a workout, it just teaches you how to striptease...sort of. How are you going to do a striptease when you have all that fat hanging off you???? This DVD is a waste in fact the only DVD in the series that is actually worth buying is disc 2. It gets your heart rate up and is a great toner. I recommend Disc 2 ""Fit to Strip"" but SKIP the rest."
2,What workout?,"Ok, Here's my beef with this video:1. Not even a workout (didn't even sweat an ounce)2. They hardly show the exercise moves! They zoom in on Carmen's face,[...] or her two stripper friends.3. Most of the video is ""practicing"" for the dance moves. You go over the dance moves a ton of times before you can actually start moving. There is no constant workout pace in this video, so therefore, whoever is doing it is not getting a workout because you are not keeping a constant pace. You dance and stop, dance and stop. So if you think this is a 55 minute workout, your sadly mistaken....maybe about a 20 minute at the most!If you want a REAL workout video, go with the CRUNCH videos...They always make you break a sweat and keep you constantly moving."
3,1 for the price of 5,"There was no question that I was so excited to get this set. The question is is it worth it? Uh... it really depends on what you want. For me, no. If you're wanting to work out to try to get toned, #2 is great. I felt this all day and the next. There are a lot of isometrics. I would recommend this singular video hands down. The rest of them... eh. They were ok. I have been using Turbo Jam for my aerobics, and I was looking for a set of dvds with the same uptempo workout to substitute for the days I want a change. There is no comparison. I found the strip routines as a whole, short and boring. You may pick up a few moves to add to your repritoire, but that's about it.Now, the videos might suck, but Carmen is a good teacher and motivator. She's not overly sexual, so it's not uncomfortable watching her and learning the moves. I gave this set 3 stars simply for video #2. If I could, I would go back and just buy that one."
2,Thought it was better,"I read all the comments on this product and was very optimistic about it. I've done ballet, sports, body workouts, swimming, etc and wanted to give it a try on other kind/amusing workouts but these videos are just like choreographies that you have to learn (although you can mix those steps if you want to dance for example) but there's no training per sé part. I was really disappointed... I expected more of this video after all the reading. Anyway, I guess you can use it just to learn sexy/lap dance."
4,It'll make you sweat!,"Out of all the aerobic DVDs I own (10-minute pilates, the Bar Method, etc.) I feel this video (Fit To Strip - disc 2 in the set) has given me the best results. After doing at least 5 days a week for about a month and a half, I have really noticed my legs changing. I have lost nearly all excess on the back of my legs (hamstring area) and even the thigh area is becoming more defined. This DVD combines cardio work with strength training which uses your own body weight and gravity against you. There are lots of squat-type exercises that focus on the legs. I recommend this DVD by itself for anyone looking to tone up for the summer!"
4,great workout!,It's a great workout video that really does get you sweating! And it builds confidence once you learn the steps and put them together! So much fun alone or with girlfriends~!
3,Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease,"I love dance and unique ways to stay fit, so I thought I'd give this a shot. It's a fun, light way to get moving, but not really a hard work out. As noted earlier, the possibility for neck and knee strain is high, so don't do anything you aren't comfortable with. Personally I don't rotate my head all the way back, for example. If you want a fun way to get moving without the aches and pains this is just the thing, but if you want a hard workout, go with DVD 2."
2,I should have listened to everyone else's review,"I recently bought this DVD and I would have to say that I should have listened to all the other reviews when I bought it. This DVD is VERY short. It's not very aroebic, and it's almost the same dance as the ""lap dance"" video on disc #5. The only difference really is it shows you how to take your clothes off while you're doing it, which I think most people could figure out anyway.So my advice is not to buy this DVD unless you get the entire set. There is no point, and you can learn almost the same dance in disc 5. You also barely get any exercise. They really messed up by calling this one ""advanced""."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"This is a complete waste of money. You can have mine!! It is not a decent workout nor will it teach you anything helpful. Your best bet is to find a class that teaches this type of stuff. I found one local in Long Beach, CA where I learned more in one class than this entire set could teach me. Save your money - buy something else!!"
4,Love Disc #2,"As a person who isn't coordinated enough to take a group aerobics class, this has been a great workout for me. I feel adequately instructed and challenged, and I like the pacing of the routine. There's no strip technique in this video, so I feel comfortable having my kids work out alongside me (for as long as their attention spans allow). Now that I'm used to the video's dialogue, I turn down the sound and play my own tunes."
2,Disappointing Contents,"This video was not what I had expected...I was hoping to learn some great Striptease dances...the dances that Carmen Electra demostrates are just choreographed dances that you see cheerleaders perform...they are sexy dances, but are not really for stripping..I was disappointed in the content of this video.."
2,Striptease for dummies,"This DVD is great for beginers. If you have any experience in dance (ballet, jazz, hip hop), you will find this DVD to be a joke. The routines are really easy, and they are repeated several times. If you've never done anything like this, get it, if you've danced, skip to Dvd #2"
3,Great for stretching,"I have had this for a few years & I find that it is great for stretching exercises. It's not one of those videos that will have your heart rate going through the roof, but is a great way to get off of the couch and move. I think it motivates people who might otherwise not be interested in physical activity to do try something different than traditional exercise. Very good for sedentary people or those who are just looking for something extra to do to break up the boredom. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not as aerobic as it could be."
3,Fun dance but not a good workout,"I don't like the way the dvd was setup I would have preferred it to be a dance and workout together rather than just an instructional video on how to perform a dance.It is also way too long to get a good aerobic workout, I just don't understand how it can be used effectively."
5,"Fun, effective, fast!","My boyfriend bought me this DVD for our six month anniversary, because I really enjoyed the first DVD in the set. Now, I do this video so often that my boyfriend (who I've now been dating for over two years) knows every word. I love it! It's absolutely the most effective at-home workout DVD I've owned (and I've owned a LOT...). Just half an hour of this every day keeps me feeling toned, and significantly slimmed my thighs. And I love that there are several routines on this disc that you can mix and match... Whether you only do 10 minutes of it, or if you do the entire thing (about an hour), you will see results. After doing this video most weekdays for about three weeks, my pants were fitting much better! I cannot stress enough that I've yet to find a more effective workout. It helps that the trainer Michael is so positive, and Carmen is so sweet that you'll feel motivated to push yourself and complete the workout. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD!"
3,A bit of fun,"This is just a bit of fun really.she giggles too much, there is no cool down, and the explanations for some of the moves are severely lacking, but when you run the warm up and 2 routines together you get a mildly cardio 15 minute routine. personally I liked the floorwork in the third routine.don't get this thinking it is sexy. It isn't. It just isn't. I use it as a warm up DVD before I do something else."
4,love it,"i did this dvd last night, it was easy to follow the steps, as i have a hard time coordinatnig steps sometimes, it wasn't to hard but not to easy either, it was just right, i definitely felt it afterwards. this is a great starter video for anyone just beginning to work out or returning to work out as myself. i will definitely be ordering the next dvd in this series after i am done toning w/this one."
3,Okay,"This workout video was more like a dance class. You learn three routines. It was fun, but it didn't feel like a great workout."
2,strip to fitness,I found the strip lap danse video to be fun and easy but the hip hop routine on the next tape was hard to follow and overall if you can run in place in your own living room well you'll get more of a workout than on that tape. If you're just looking to learn fun strip moves the strip tape good but dont count on getting a workout from that set of tapes unless youre really a beginner at fitness i mean the routine you learn overall takes like less than 5 min once you put it together.
1,PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I should have listened to the poor reviews and avoided this useless cd set. Watch MTV for 5 minutes and you can pick up these moves. Total waste.
2,Striptease ?,"a bit disappointed as I found ... no stripteaseThe ""NOT RATED' spiel ... is a ruse of course.Yes, she is beautiful, she can dance ... but ..."
1,This is not a work out video,"I can't believe all the good reviews this DVD got. This is in no way a workout video. There's no way you can break a sweat. And the cameraman is terrible, you can't even see her feet and what she's doing. therefore i am lost at times not knowing what to do (I've never taking any dancing classes, so I might need more instruction than most). I do not recommend this at all."
2,Not a workout. Good to learn moves.,Not much a workout at all. It is a video for you if you want to learn the moves only. Good step by step instruction by Carmen though.
1,Not even ONE star!,"CHEESE! Absolute CHEESE! I wouldn't give this ONE star, but there was no option for zero stars. This has to be THE CHEESIEST production ever made. Granted, she's no fitness guru, but come on! If you're absolutely clueless as to the art of striptease, it's a good introduction. But, it's NO workout and is so basic that it's almost insulting to those who can actually do a lap dance. Oh well, you live and learn. Anyone wanna buy mine? I have the 2nd video too. :("
2,What a let down,"Don't let the DVD title fool you, this has absolutly nothing to do with stripping. There are no sexy moves or routines to learn. It's not even that good of a work out. This is just about marketing. Carmen Electra acts fairly ditzy and she isn't even leading the video. Save your money"
3,if you're looking for a good workout....,"this is not for you.however, if you are a VERY inexperienced dancer and want to learn some basic moves this might be for you. carmen electra does a good job at teaching the moves and she also does make you feel comfortable doing something which most of us would probably feel really uncomfortable doing. she makes it easy but you wont break a sweat...well unless your idea of working out for the past 3 years has been walking from your TV to the fridge."
1,"deserves a ZERO rating, pathetic","what a crime, to use your name to say a video is a workout....this is absolutely a PATHETIC video and is in no way a workout, you would carmen would hvae a clue about the quality of this video, it is terrible, don't waste a penny."
2,the basics,"Though the moves were slow and easy to learn, they were very basic. I reccomend this video for those who like aerobics and want easy moves in addition to a workout. As for me, I am looking for a video with a lot more moves that dive deeper into exotic dancing. It was also frustrating when the camera was closed in on Carmen's face, which doesn't help when trying to watch a move."
3,Good but...,"I enjoyed the videos but I don't feel like I got much of a workout from them. They are fun and have some challenging moves but overall, not very strenuous."
3,Difficult to see,"This video is okay - it is difficult to get the moves down, especially when the just shoot the instructors' faces during difficult moves. Be ready - the video is definitely low impact - lower than I was expecting."
3,Ehhh,"It's okay, doesn't really make you sweat but more how to be sexy while working out. Workouts were slow but they were fun doing."
1,So dissappointing,"I thought this would be a fun way to workout, but its very slow paced, and there is no challenge involved. All the moves are nothing I havent seen before. Complete waste of money."
1,didn't recieve item,"I would never buy from amazon again, i never recieved my item, i ordered in may it was supposed to be here by may 18th and i emailed amazon about this to let them know that i hadn't gotten the package,they were supposed to look into it, when i was emailed back they told me that the package had been delivered, funny thing is thati'm still waiting on it to get here,however amazon didn't waste anytime getting the money out of my account, if they had just gotten my item to me as soon as they took my money then i would be happy with that, i will never order anything from them again. use e-bay i've never had this problem when using e-bay.hope they enjoyed my 40 bucks, and if i ever get my workout dvds i'm sure i'll enjoy them as they've enjoyed taking my money."
2,You call this dancing?? SEXY??? um....,"How about Spastic Saturday Night Live Cheerleader...I didn't like this DVD set...If, you are looking to learn to dance and you have absolutely no rhythm of your own.. no idea how to find your own sexy style.. you don't go clubbing at all (or you do but you don't dance) .. maybe this is a good **Start**But.. if you already know how to dance -- you already have a natural sex appeal-- this is a little strange. The dances are kinda cheesy (Definitely nothing I'd do out anywhere)..And in regards to a workout.... Oh... theres no workout here. My favorite Dance workout so far is Zumba -- and even still-- I have to do it after a good cardio workout. There also isn't much variety here. I work out daily and try to work out a combination of muscle groups. This tape... nothing... absolutely nothing."
4,good workout,great dvd's and brand new; a really good deal for the price shipping took longer than usual but they sent an email to me about it ahead of time to notify me
1,Zero star! for this item!,ok! Amazon should have the option to rate the item with a 0 star when is sooo bad like this one!What a way to waste money..carmen electra has a -1 whit this DVD!Bad Bad Bad!
3,Not To bad,I have used this DVD a few times now since i ordered it. I must say that the DVD was in perfect condition upon recieving it from Amazon.
2,Not what I expected,"I didn't realize there were no stripteases on this DVD - it's just about getting you into shape for one. I ended up buying the first DVD in the series (Aerobic Striptease) afterward, which is actually worth the money."
3,Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease,"Ordered this for the laughs - did not expect to actually exercise to this. I tried it and it made me pretty sore, so it is probably okay for a lot of people who are already in shape and want something different. Pretty good for laughs though."
1,Totally worthless...,"Save your money and buy a different workout. The whole set was pretty much worthless. I thought there would be a LOT more cardio than what it was. I didn't even work up a single bead of sweat. It may be good if you are a newbie to the exercise world, but if you are even intermediate in fitness, I would skip this. Come on, Carmen! Dancers have more moves than that!"
2,"UM, SKIP IT!","OK, I guess if you get motivated by watching a thin beautiful girl to lose weight, then you will like this video, I have not touched the video in months, it's not worth much to me, it HARDLY has anything that would count as exercise, this woman is very narcissistic and loves being in front of the camera, she looks good, but that is the best part and all you will get from this, do some in place jogging and you will get ALOT more of a work out than this."
3,not very advanced,"Disk 1 - 4 starsDisk 2 - 5 starsDisk 3 - 3 starsDisk 4 - 2 starsDisk 5 - 1 star (have no attach to striptease)Really, i expected much from from last 3 parts. Disk 3 is the best from last three one. It has only one dance that is ok. Not the worse that could be. It have very nice element and if you will put a bit of fantasy - you can make your own nice strip-dance.Just be yourself, feel sexy and take a bit of instructions. They everything work out perfect."
2,No stripping here,"I just finished doing this workout video. If I had wanted a purely aerobic video, there are many much better ones I could have chosen. There were many distractions in this video. The music is an annoying elevator boppity-bop sound. Carmen Electra spends a lot of time watching the instructor as if she doesn't know the routines, and often she's slightly off tempo from him.I fell prey to marketing with this video. I guess I didn't read the reviews thoroughly, but I thought I would learn something about strip tease. Instead, I was just watching Carmen giggling at her balding, sleazy trainer. The only thing that impressed me: boy, is she in shape!"
3,THERE IS NO STRIPPING IN THIS VIDEO,"The workout is really fun and very effective but is not what I expected. I should have read the reviews more carefully. Carmen is a little bit annoying, her trainer is a better motivator. Some of the moves are not filmed as well as they could be. Sometimes you have to guess how to start out on a move because the camera is focusing in too long on Carmens mug. Overall a good workout video that I would recommend to anyone just starting to get into shape."
1,I'm Dissappointed,This video was worthless. Carmen doesn't do a lot of the exercises correctly and she looks really bored. I could not get into this video as much as I tried. I will not buy another one of her workout videos.
3,Only Worth it as a Set,"It's definitely better to buy the five-disc set, as each dvd is relatively short and focuses on different things. All together, however, it's a pretty well-rounded workout, with cardio routines on the first disc, isolations on the second, two (kind of lame) stripteases on the third, a hip-hop and lapdance routines on the fourth and fifth. Alone the discs would not be worth the $$, but as a set they're fun, keep things moving and varied, and will get your heart rate up a bit."
3,A little disappointing.,"First I must confess that I have only used the first DVD in this set. That said, I was very enthusiastic about using it and was prepared for a great, sexy workout. Instead I found myself mainly standing there watching Carmen bat her eyelashes and giggle for the camera. The routine is fun but this hardly qualifies as an aerobic workout, and she doesn't cue right and left very well for the viewer. Probably the best thing I can say about this video is that all the hip rolls, hip thrusts and back arching force me to use and stretch out muscles that often stiffen up from more conventional workouts, which feels good, but the presentation on this video hardly qualifies it as an actual workout. Have fun with it, but don't expect too much."
3,not what i expected,"I ordered this workout video for some fun and differet workouts. I have only tried the first dvd, and it was not what i expected. It was extremely slow and not much of a work out. It takes so long to learn the steps, that there isn't time for a workout. Also, the workout is about an hour long. I was looking for something shorter and that would keep my heart rate up."
5,it's hott!!!,This product features a fun and fast way to get in shape. There are workouts designed for various levels of fitness and they provide a creative way to learn dancing. I highly recommend this because girls just wanna have fun!!
3,cheesy but fun,"I was recommended this product by a friend because the workout itself is a good one, however if you are trying to spice things up with the additional strip instructions I wouldn't say this would meet your expectations. The whole thing is a bit cheesy and not very sexy. Sure Carmen looks good doing this but I would say stick to her workout and you'll be happy."
3,"Fun but not a ""work"" out","I have had the whole series for about a year and although it's fun to do and does give you some great moves to try in the bedroom, as far as a cardio workout. Well, it's not. I dont even sweat to it anymore, I kept buying the next one in the series thinking they would increase in intensity. They don't.. I havent touched it in months."
2,None,I feel like Carmen Electra has no knowledge of teaching classes whatsoever. This video was not intended as a work out but marketed that way to make more money. This was upposed to be a beginning level arobics and instead it was the complete opposite
4,carmen electra's aerobic striptease,Really fun fun fun workout makes every women feel sexual and happy with her body. The one thing I didn't like is that the dvd really has only 3 routines and one routine repeats itself 5 times!!! I don't think it is fair to say the DVD has a one hour workout when the same routine fill over than a half of the DVD! THANKS.
5,Excellent,"I got this set about a year ago. I needed to lose extra weight from giving birth to two children, but I hate regular workouts, because they feel so much like work. I'd heard about this set, and thought it was worth a try. I love it! With 5 different discs, I can incorporate variety into what I do. Disc 2 alone allows for variety. I get up in the mornings, before my kids get up and before I go to work, but since I hate to get up too early, I only have about 30 minutes. I can pick and choose which workout to do that day, just from disc 2, or I can do the whole thing if I happen to wake up even earlier, a rare but possible occurrence.I think that this set is well worth the money. Anyone looking to lose a little weight, get in shape, have fun, not be bored, and learn some interesting dance moves should give this set a shot."
5,Awesome!,"This Dvd is awesome becuase it gets you toned and in shape...and the title cleary states fit to strip, so if your just looking to strip this may not be the dvd for you....the other four dvds in the series allow you to do the stripping routines...I have fit to strip and aerobic striptease both are easy to follow and they walk you through each step. The fit to strip diffentely works you into a sweat, but it isn't so hard that your left behind. Plus you can pause it at anything to say grab a chair or get a glass of water..."
1,THIS IS NOT A WORKOUT -- IT'S A JOKE,"DON'T BUY THIS. Yes, Carmen Electra is sexy, but she has nothing to offer. There is NO content in this video. It's not a workout and it certainly has no right to use the word ADVANCED. I'm totally disappointed. I was looking forward to a sexy, fun aerobic workout and I got nothing. I really should have read the reviews before buying. Lesson learned."
3,Missing the 20 Minute Toning Workout,"The workout ""20 Minute Toning"" is the same as the ""Isolation: Lower Body"" workout. There is no 20 Minute Toning workout as stated on the routine screen. Other then that, the workout is fun."
1,Didn't even sweat...,"Perhaps others will disagree but this video isn't all that great. As a dancer, I thought I'd try this video since the title is ""fit to strip,"" I assumed it would incorporate strengthening and a good workout. I was wrong. If you're wanting a very basic workout video then this may work for you. Also, some may not know that this doesn't have any ""stripping,"" in it--and Carmen isn't really the main focus of the video either. She and her trainer are walking you through the moves. To be honest, it's more like watching Carmen during a personal training session. For me it wasn't worth the time or money which is why I only gave it 1 star."
2,A disappointment,"I am in agreement with previous reviewers who didn't appreciate the constant headshots of Carmen. It's hard to follow a routine where you can't see the moves.Two other negatives: 1st: Carmen doesn't seem to be on beat with the music part of the time. Initially I thought it was a soundtrack issue, but her assistants do keep the rhythm well.The ""warm-up"" routines were fair (hence the 2 stars), and I could pretty well figure out the steps. Slower-paced and cued, they made learning the steps tolerable.The second problem: Once you get past that 10 minute warm-up, it's assumed you remember all the moves. The music kicks in, the routine is at full speed, and Carmen's only cue is at the beginning: ""5, 6, 7, 8!"" Perhaps it's my own weakness I can't remember how many pliés to do before the relevés. Craning my head to see what step we were on was just too much for me.Not recommended for non-dancers, people with neck trouble, or individuals seriously looking to learn some exotic moves."
3,Be careful of bulking up...,"I'm a naturally muscular person and found that the exercizes really bulked me up in only 2 weeks! It did an awesome job of toning but my pants were tighter than before I started the dvd :( . If you are in need of toning and are not naturally muscular, get this dvd - it totally works and the instructor is a great motivator. However, if you are looking to slim down and lengthen your muscles, I'd probably stick with something like pilates or yoga."
3,Only For Beginners,"I work out at home with videos 5 days a week and while this video was great for a beginner, once you hit mid or high level workouts it's kind of useless. I will say that if you are just starting to work out at home and whatnot it's a great way to get started, it's relatively slow paced and not too challenging. It's also good if you've been sick or injured and are easing your way back into exercising. Beware that the editing isn't great - the instructor does not do the same # of reps per side and at one point didn't even do the other ""half"" of one of the exercises.Once you are ready for something more challenging I would suggest Jillian Michaels No More Trouble Zones, 30 Day Shred, and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism!"
2,disappointed,I was expecting more of an aerobic work out from this video. I found that the camera focussed on Carmen's face when it should have been focussing on her body. I couldn't tell which way her body was moving so for the most part I was completely lost when it came time to putting the moves together. There's a lot more talking than workout time. The video started out fun however it became frustrating when I couldn't tell which way her body was moving and all I saw was her head bobbing up and down to the music. I was disappointed.
1,no workout,"The workout in this is non existant, and the dance routine soon becomes boring and the same thing over and over again. And Carmens dumbness gets really annoying."
4,Worth the workout!,"To me it sounds like people wanted this to be a ""How To Strip 101"" DVD, but thats not what it is suppose to be. It is a workout video in a fun way, unlike the usual just to these routine videos. If anyone is looking for just a good workout with a little difference to it then its a good buy. If you are looking to learn how to strip, then go to a class or something."
4,A good workout... but it doesn't involve stripping,"If you're looking to learn how to do a striptease, this volume is not the one you want (get volume 1). But if you're looking to tone up your body, then this is the DVD for you. I like that there are so many different programs to choose from--it prevents boredom, and you can target certain areas or combine your favorite workouts together. Also, you don't need any equipment except a chair to do all the routines. If you're already in great shape, it probably won't do too much except help maintain your fitness level, but if you're trying to get back into exercising regularly, this is a great segueway. Additionally, the instructor and Carmen are very low-key and unannoying compared to most workout programs where you are assaulted by ""upbeat"", overly cheerful exhortations."
1,Even My Husband Hates It!,"I bought this series expecting something that would be a fun work out. Carmen as a teacher she needs a lot to be desired... Counting the steps while learning is important but don't get crazy either! She basically non-stop counted during 90-95% of the steps, it got to where it was difficult to concentrate on what you were doing even. This is great if you have kids, or a parrot, needing to learn to count to 8 however. The Fit to Strip is taught by an instructor with her as a student and it is excellent however. I was very disappointed basically with this purchase overall."
4,Not so bad,"Think 2nd disk (from all five) is the best disk. It have the most information, exercises and stress on your entire body. You can take it as basic of trainings.First disk is also pretty nice. Nice 40 minutes of warming up and some nice moves that you can use as basic for your own striptease-dance.Disk 3,4 and 5 are almost the same. Every of them have 1 (maximum 2) very typical dance. Dance itself is about 4-6 minutes and other 35 minutes goes repeat of movements to make it perfect. But think dance (with hat and tie) will be useful for many ladies, cause it's really nice and exiting :)DVD's very nice build for people who just wanna stretch their body or people who wanna serious training. Anyway, strongly recommended for everybody!"
4,Good Workout,"I only bought the fit to strip DVD and found it very useful. I thought the warm up was very good, there are a lot of exercises done in a short amount of time. I really felt the burn after the first couple times. I think Carmen's attitude is great. She confesses she doesn't breath while exercising and other problems she has, which I found comforting. The menu is great, allowing you to pick which mix of the routines you want, or just pick one routine. I like this DVD and will continue to use it over some of my other workout DVDs."
3,A Good Start,"Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease is a fine product, with high production values, clear instruction, and a motivating host. Further, this DVD collection gives the purchaser all of the aerobic striptease videos which Carmen Electra has made, saving a lot of time, effort, and money on building the collection.It is an excellent start. However, it doesn't go far enough. If the viewer wants to master the skills of exotic dancing, then this collection is only an introduction - a very good one, but not a source of in depth instruction. Likewise, if the viewer's goal is to build aerobic fitness and/or flexibility, then these DVDs will get you started, but you'll soon have to move on to more vigorous exercise to build your fitness.If you want to get started, then there is no better place to begin than with these videos. They will help you identify your fitness goals and problem areas, so that you can use other fitness techniques to address those goals and ""tough spots""."
5,Lots of fun,"This is not only a great workout, but is accessible to lots of levels of fitness. It's fun and makes any woman feel sexy. I totally recommend it."
3,Fun Workout,"I have never really liked Carmen Electra all that much, but I wanted to get away from the same old workouts I had always done, and this seemed like something new and fun. The workout itself was fun, although the entire DVD is dedicated to teaching you the moves which really doesn't feel like you're getting a good workout (although I was sweating by the end!) You have the option of programming the routines to play up to three times in a row at full tempo though, so thats not too bad, just repeat that several times, and that would probably be a good workout. Even after learning the routine, I still felt somewhat inferior, just because compared to Carmen and the dancers, I felt like a COW! :-) But, it IS fun, and if nothing else, you'll get a good laugh while you try to look as sexy as she does!"
2,Not as advertised,"I bought this video specifically because it stated it had Spanish dubbing and Spanish subtitles, but it had neither.I give it 2 stars because the content in English was fine."
4,Chris Hartman Forever Fit II,"This is a good update on her earlier Forever Fit, with new music and new moves, very good"
3,More for when your little one is taller,My little 14 month old bumps his head into the head of the Dino Rocker when he rides on it so I keep my hand in front of his head as a sheild. But he loves the rocking action so maybe when he is a little taller he can enjoy it on his own.
3,"Good choice, but not really grill-friendly/heat-proof","I have used a lot of grill skewers and these are great because they are strong and the metal end works well for piercing tough meat and vegetables without being sharp enough to cause the occasional finger cut. However, the only caveat is that you must keep the handles away from the flame and sticking out of the grill by several inches (thereby making the meat closest to the handle usually undercooked). If you don't, the rubber melts (why is there rubber on something meant for the grill?) and the slider will be stuck in place. If this happens (it did with mine) it really doesn't decrease the utility of the item, but you can't use the slider portion anymore. I bought these and will buy again though."
5,VERY Impressive for Moonshine............,"Ah yes, the mixed live series has been some of their benchmark releases, but with Tall Paul on the decks, Moonshine has outdone theirselves. One of the greatest UK djs, in command in LA....need i say more. The opening track (Mauro Picotto-""Like this Like That""), grabs you and holds you throughout this compilation. Pauls mixing skills are seamless, too, no trainwrecks on a live CD is very very impressive. He starts his set off with a couple of bangers then brings it on home trancing ur arse away using several anthems, one being his own track Tall Paul vs INXS....""Precious Heart""..which is a beautifully constructed track. Then he feeds more life in with the the Goodfellas ""Soulheaven""...arguably one of the most played tracks at the time!!!!5 stars are not enough, yet all we have so check it out!!!!!"
4,A Giant nitro blast,"Mixed live at the infamous grand opening of Giant at the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. Thousands tried to get into the club and were turned away. Hundreds tried to get into the Platnium Room to see Tall Paul and were told the room had reached capacity. If you were lucky enough to be there, Tall Paul threw down an amazing set that had the crowd jumping on their feet, soaking in the blasts of nitro air. If you weren't so lucky, here's a chance to experience that magical night."
2,Disappointed,I'm a big fan of the original film and was excited to learn of this digitized remake. The computer imaging and music were exceptional and fully satisfied my expectations for this type of film but the script and acting all but ruined the experience for me. The dialogue and plot seemed forced and fake. Daamen Krall (Caligari) and Doug Jones (Cesare) were wonderful in their roles yet I felt as if their talent was wasted on the weak script. The remaining actors were amateur at best seemed to be drowning in each other's over exaggerated dialogue and motions.Overall The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Remix) was a big disappointment.
1,Rubbish,Lame. Laughable really. Stick with the original film. The digital backgrounds look like a bad soap opera. Cinematic feces for the easily amused.
2,AFRICAN SUNRISE/MANHATTAN RAVE,THIS IS A COMPLAINT-not a review. Heard this CD on PBS and am trying to listen to it here. I find no listing of the songs on the cd to check to listen. HELP!
2,It has its moments but enjoy the original,"I want to revise my original review of this CD. Nothing compares to the original music from the motion picture soundtrack and Oscar Promo as it is so beautiful and touching. The short story, film, and the music have touched me deeply. I listened to this version today and I now have a kinder opinion. The music has a beautiful, haunting quality. Almost like the memories of Ennis of his happier days on Brokeback Mountain and when Jack was alive. The vocals are still pretty awful except for Willie, and Cline."
4,Happy Cowboy...,"Am very happy with the CD... I was a little aprehensive about the order after reading some of the reviews, but am so glad i did."
1,Out of phase!,"As the title of this review implies. The music of the soundtrack, sounds as if it's being performed a quarter or a half step out of phase.It sounds terrible! I thought that this would be an orchestral version ofGustabal Santollala's wonderful film score.And the bonus tracks are taken from live recording, rather than studio tracks. A bad buy. Skip this one!"
4,Cute charm.,"I bought this charm in sterling silver. I was trying to find a tour bus, but this is the closest thing I could find. It has nice detail, including headlights, rim spokes and bumpers. The only thing I don't like about it is that the underside is hollow. It does look great on my charm bracelet."
5,Make me move.,"The most fun I've had wile still standing. If you can call dancing around in a sweaty crazed state of giddy glee ""still standing"". At any rate this is not music to stand still to, it's music to make your soul happy.Glad to see it hit amazon, fill the world with glee."
3,It pays off its price,"This white jian is a nice tool for practicing your martial art form, but don't try to have contact with the blade.It's nothing marvellous or imppeccable, but what were you expecting anyway? It's really cheap.Personally I have it for more than a year and it looks just fine, except for the yin-yang part which is starting to fade away.If what you look for is a nice pretty beginner's sword that will drop the jaws of your kung fu fellows, here it is. But don't except anything else than that, obviously."
3,"First, a Lady","Tish Baldridge is a special lady and a heroine who has made a real difference to our country's culture. As a secretary (with three degrees) and a person who loves to read about the best in society, I really got involved with her social secretarial positions. I loved to read about the inside operations of the French and Italian embassies. I am old enough to remember the David Bruce's and Clare Booth Luce from VOGUE magazine, and reading about her adventures in Paris and Rome back then was such a treat. Of course, I enjoyed inside information on the Kennedy White House too. Her public relations business and personal triumphs were inspiring and always stimulating too. This is a wonderful read."
2,Breezy and self-absorbed.,"Mrs. Baldrige wrote this in a light, 'skipping the surface' style that presented the events of her life in the Kennedy White House and the embassies of Paris and Rome without seriousness or substance. Surely Mrs. Baldrige has experienced more than being in the company of the 'best' people being served 'top notch' food and wine. Surely her life has held more interesting moments than the time she seated people incorrectly at an embassy dinner. Surely Mrs. Kennedy had more on her mind than being irritated that others thought she was 'so lucky to have Tish!' This book is only for those who are fascinated with titbits like the above. For others, don't bother."
3,Met expections,"A bit overpowered for a small bathroom remodel, perhaps, but it's hard to find fan/heater/light combinations that look half-way decent.Looks good. Fan is too loud, but it very powerful. The heater rocks."
2,We are disappointed.,"Very nice looking fan. We like the glass light cover, and the fact that it takes a 100watt bulb. But it is loud. It does clear the air fast. We hate the difficulty in changing the light bulb. It doesn't look secure and it is not easy."
3,A Funny Satire,"A friend recommended me this book because she believed it was simply a satirical look at the crazy world of sports. She was right. And sadly, that's all it is.Lupica's modernistic approach to writing is at some times refreshing but for at least most of this book, takes away from potentially what could have been a better plot with funnier characters.This book is an excellent weekend read for anyone looking for a few chuckles, but is certainly not worth the investment at face value. (However, I would recommend buying the bargain price now offered.)"
4,summer read,"This was a good book if you do not take it too serious.It will be a good read sitting on the beach during the summer to help settle your football fix until next fall.There is some truth mixed in with fiction.The main character ""Jammer"" is someone that you would want on your side.Lots of T&A references to all the parties and drinking from ballpayers."
4,The NFL According to Lupica,"Professional sports at the NFL level are so full of people as are depicted in this book that I was tempted to look at it as a very funny work of non-fiction. It is populated with characters - funny ones - serious ones - dangerous ones - stupid ones and many very curvy ones. As usual, Mike has an ear for how people in this genre carry themselves and while the plot of the story - whether or not Jammer Molloy, son of the owner of the New York Hawks will be allowed to become an owner of the team after his daddy dies and leaves it to him, is never in serious doubt, it is the ""how"" of making this happen that is entertaining and not ""whether."". No one writes this kind of book better than Mike Lupica. At least not yet!"
3,"Enjoyable, But No DanJenkins","In Bump & Run, author Mike Lupica, out of the NY Daily News, tries real hard at being Dan Jenkins but, like everyone else, has come up just shy of the first down marker.Sometime, you gotta play hurt, and other times, you should stay in the trainer's room."
3,So it's not great literature. . . .,"Mike Lupica has always been my favorite reporter on the Sports Reporters and I have read some of his newspaper articles as I come across them. I've never read any of his books, but I thought I would give it a try.The plot of the book has been well covered in the reviews. Jack ""Jammer"" Molloy inherits half of father's NFL team. Having master the world of Las Vegas, Jammer figures he can master the world of NFL.The characters come off as one dimensional, but so what, it just makes the book funnier. The interested point is how the characters in the NFL world can make Las Vegas seem tame. If you look hard enough, you will many modern day sports stars lurking in the book.Bump and Run is quick reading and won't win any awards, but it is a perfect book for a sports fan to read in between more ""serious"" subjects. The thing to remember is that it's a fun read. I recommend the book if you keep this in mind."
2,Too vulgar,"I thought it was kinda funny, but i think that there was too much profanity and vulgarity. Is it possible to write something funny and entertaining without lossing your integrity? It might be, but not for luppica."
5,A GREAT BOOK,"Once again Ann Rule has written another book that is so engrossing you can't put it down. She keeps you on the edge of your seat with this book, I continuously buy her books everytime a new one comes out because she can tell a horrific story with all the details and makes you feel like you were there. I recommend Ann Rule books to all my family and friends. Great book, worth every dime!"
3,Not her best work,I'm sorry but I can't give this book a 5 star rating. Ann is very talented but this project was lackluster and clearly biased. There was nothing new in her retelling of this story that hadn't already been reported on late night crime TV or internet news articles. Ann has a great reputation as a true crime writer but leaves her real talent at the door on this one.
3,"Too obviously ""abridged.""",Why can't Ann Rule's books EVER come out on audio UNABRIDGED??I would pay the extra price for them.
2,average crime fare,"I read Ann Rule occasionally because I like true crime. This is not her best or her worst, but as usual I pick out a few errors. Here is the biggest faux pas: (pg 354) MOST MEN IN JAIL AND PRISON DON'T HURT WOMEN AND TAKE A HARSH VIEW OF PRISONERS ACCUSED OF KILLING THEM. INMATES CHARGE WITH CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN OR CHILDREN WHO ARE HOUSED IN THE GENERAL POPULATION ARE PRONE TO ACCIDENTS FOR WHICH NO WITNESSES COME FORWARD. Where was Ann's editor when she submitted this? I worked at Montana State Prison and it is full of domestic offenders who have repeatedly hurt, abused and/or killed women. No that is not correct, a very LARGE percentage of men in prison hurt women. Typically other inmates don't like child molesters and target them, but so many inmates are guilty/convicted of domestic violence that those people are not typically a target. Give me a break, you have been writing crime novels for years, how could you have made such an ignorant statement?"
5,Excellent!,"Bart Corbin is one of the strangest individuals Rule has written about to date, and the tale is engrossing and compelling. Ms. Rule writes with her trademark empathy for the victims and attention to the details of the investigation. One of her best yet!"
1,Not for me. one dimensional characters.,"Nearly perfect wife-victim and suspect-husband-dentist with no redeeming qualities other than being tall, good looking, and witty are the main characters! No big surprises nor twists once the plot has been revealed. Story veered off track, like gossip, in a couple chapters explaining how each set of parents met and married. Like a bad movie, I finished it anyway, but it never improved. I'm surprised, disappointed, and misled by so many high star rankings. Not in my book!"
5,Good Ann Rule,"Ann Rule is one of my favorite authors, I have every book she has written. While I enjoyed this book it isn't one of my favorites..I still get a chill when I think of ""The Stranger Beside Me"" and ""Green River Running Red"" For anyone who likes true crime Ann is a MUST read."
4,An Intriguing Read!,I enjoyed this book or as much as a book can be enjoyed that is about someone being murdered by their allegedly loving husband. I'm so thankful there is someone such as the author that gives the victim a voice & makes readers aware of what the victims had to endure. I'm glad justice prevailed & the so called loving husband was found guilty. It never ceases to amaze me how many people murder their spouses instead of simply divorcing them. And how many people are actually capable of murder when it comes to money. Another great read by the queen of true crime.
3,"So many twists & turns, you couldn't make it up!","This tale of two murders is truly amazing. I didn't know anything about this case before I picked this book up, and there were a couple of plot developments that almost took my breath away. But while the saga is spellbinding, the storytelling is just so-so. Every aspect of the lives of those involved are explained in great detail. Much of the investigative process is examined closely, too. Then, it seems, once Dr. Bart is put in jail, boom-boom-boom, time is telescoped, everything happens in a matter of pages, and The End. As workmanlike as Ann Rule's work is here, she deserves applause for the careful way she depicts Dolly and Jenn. It would have been easy to sensationalize certain aspects of both women's lives, but Ms. Rule instead chooses respect and compassion."
3,I'd call it 3-1/2 stars,This was a pretty good true crime story - one where you can't believe people think they can get away with anything. It also shows you how much some people can be concerned with themselves only - and if anything interferes with that ...watch out! It wasn't the best true crime I have ever read but the pages went by fairly rapidly.
2,"Not her worst, but certainly not her best","Years back I read one Ann Rule book which I thought was good. Since then I've read more of hers but they haven't been as good as that first one. With this book I found the writing wasn't very clear in telling the story of this case, nor in making it interesting to me. To tell you the truth, I couldn't get myself to finish it."
4,Too Late to Say Goodbye,"Have not read book yet, but I am sure I will since I enjoyed In the Still of The Night so much. She is a new author for me and I'm looking forward to ordering more books from your company."
3,Ann Rule knows her subject well and does not disappoint!,"Read it while on an extended hospital stay and it made the time pass quickly. Another good Ann Rule yarn...however, someday I'd like to read a story by her where the husband loves the wife and isn't some obsessive killer! : )"
3,Rule is the Rule but not this time,"Please hear me, Ann Rule is my favorite author bar none. However, this book was really one of my least favorites and I bought it before it even came out and savored the joy of opening it only to find kind of an empty story. The Ann Rule I have come to know has more details and insight into crime than any other T.C. author out there but this one just falls short. It just seemed like she was simply reporting facts instead of going deep inside a story as she usually does. I was left thinking, okay, so what?"
5,Too Late to Say goodbye,"Awesome book it is good to see all concepts regarding cases like this. It is not an one dimensional, great read can't put it down"
2,it's ok,I've read a lot of true crime novels and this one just seemed flat. It seemed more like a report than a story. And I was looking more for a story
4,Good,"All Anne Rule books are well researched, written, and interesting. Name one that took you longer than 3 days. This one is no different. While it is great, and the story deserved to be told for the purpose of the memories of the victims, it is not the same intensity as Death By Sunset, 'Stranger.."", or Everything She Ever Wanted. This is not due to the writing or research, merely due to the fact that Bart Corbin was just not a very interesting person. He was an egotisical, self-centered man, who thought he could get away with anything. This profile is not rare in true crime novels. Nevertheless, the story is interesting and worth reading."
3,Adequate,"A fairly interesting story told by a less-than-talented writer. Sorry, she may be called the queen of true crime but she's just not that skilled in the craft of writing. Lots of fluff and redundant information presented in simpleton writing that she fails to spice up with a few oddly-placed vocabulary words."
4,The Deadly Dentist and the Desperate Housewife,"Ann Rule's atmospheric writing and character portraits make you think you're reading one of Elmore Leonard's crime dramas. This well written riveting story is real however and brings you deep inside the life and times of a deadly dentist and a desperate housewife. Review by Robert Betancourt, author and screenwriter ofMost Favored Nation"
1,1st and last Ann Rule I will ever read,"What a mess to read. Desperately in need of an editor and/or proofreader. Maybe 'true-crime' has lower standards for writing ability, but this book was a real chore. Extremely repetitive, excessively flowery and descriptive. Minimal suspense or insight. Why is this a story we need to read? Smacks of exploitation. According to the other reviewers not one of her best, but I will not give her a second chance."
5,Another Ann Rule Winner!,"As usual Ann Rule keeps you glued to the book and unable to put it down. I am an avid reader of her books and always look forward to her next book release. Thanks Ann for another one of your ""winners."""
4,Ann Rule never disappoints!,"Another page turner. I will always purchase her books as they become available! If you are interested in true crime stories, she is the master story teller."
2,The victim is an angel,"I have read several of Ann Rule's books, but i think this is the last one. I got hooked when I read Stranger Beside Me, that was a cool book, this is not so. In her books, there are two kind of characters: the victim is always like an angel like creature, always smiling, always welcoming, always active in the church. The criminal is always bad, coming from broken families, doing all sort of bad things. Everybody, even the most savage killer has a good side, and even the most angelic victim has a bad side, this is not the case anymore in this book. I went through it within few days, not even a week, scanning pages. Now, I have to look for other true crime writers."
2,Poor Casebook,"zanandjayna's review sums up much about how I feel about this casebook.Other complaints that I had is that the notes/comments sections are quite poor and are usually of little relevance to the case and/or concept you just studied. Also many of the cases have been poorly edited, leaving out key concepts that most prof's expect you to know.All in all, this is a poor casebook. If you use it i recommend a good supplement.Review pertains to 5th edition"
3,Ugh...,"This book is extremely tedious. The authors use extensive language, commentary, and notes which further confuse and do not explain the already-difficult concepts presented in the cases.Not for pleasure reading. This book is used in Contracts Law classes; if your professor is not one who likes explaining things to any great extent I highly suggest purchasing a supplement or two to help you understand on your own."
1,Dissapointed,In first place this sliding short doesn't have pouch for the hard cup as it is announced. In second term it neither has padding. So it is a fake
1,What a Stinker!!!,"Seems that nearly everyone is self-publishing these days. I guess Scott Shechter decided to join the bandwagon. Not only does this book show a remarkable lack of any visual ingenuity, but the contents are dissmal. I guess every fan who can put two words together and form a publishing company can now grab a few well worn pictures and slap together a book.This book does not contain any new information that has not been previously presented in better form by biographers such as John Fricke or Gerald Frank. A new reader does well to stick to biographers who have actually done their homework."
3,Hmmm....,"While I did not find this book overwhelmingly wonderful, it does not deserve the comments being thrust upon it. There is indeed, NOT any new information, but it is a different type of a format.The photos are disappointing in that they have been seen many times elsewhere and I would not consider this author to be ""the world's premiere Judy Garland authority."" He has not turned up any new info, he seems to prefer the tragic image of Judy Garland, even using several unproved theories and stories, and has not pursued any new avenues of research.<..."
1,Ugh,"How anyone could even call this a good biography, let alone a great one or best one is beyond me. It tanked in sales and landed in the ramainder bins almost overnight. The pictures were overused, seen hundreds of times before. No perspective, no history, just boring, stupid inane dates, times, etc.And the reprinting of the woman's will? How low can you go!"
2,Ok as an extra,"This book is OK as an extra little book on Judy Garland, but there are several others out there that out do it by a long ways. Most of the entries are tedious, boring, dull and sometimes just plain silly. Also, every bit of info has been previously published many times. Schechter does not provide one single bit of new information or show that he has don any new research other than to look through previously exposed Garland books and materials.Schechter seems to like the idea of a victimized Judy Garland and repeats several of those old time myths and legends that have since been show in a new a proper light.The worst part are the photos. Nearly all, and I mean about 99% of them, have been seen many times over.I also take great exception to Schechter's or anyone else billing themselves as the ""premier Garland historian."" This guy's work on Garland is, at best, mediocre."
2,TOO FAR OVER THE RAINBOW,"It's all here ... except, perhaps, for the days and times of Judy's bowel movements and pill popping. And where are the details of life in Scarsdale? Hyannis? Too much is too much. And not enough is too little."

4,Tom Ford Philosophy,"The book is in the middle of something. Great interview, where you understand why the designs, not in a very deep way. And on the other hand, i think not only artistical and publicity photographs are required to understand what the collections where about. Where are the sketches, where are the muses and the inspiration came from. If you like fashion, and you love Tom Ford's designs, you should buy the book. Great photographs."
4,Just Tom Ford,"All of the necessary information about tom fords work with Gucci, simple, chic and grand. Great for people who are in fashion business."
5,FORD,"This really is the complete Tom Ford. It is hella expensive, but if you are someone who is a fan of Ford, then I can't imagine you being disappointed. Tom Ford has had an amazing career, he rivived two legendary fashion houses and made himself a star, now he says he wants to direct, uh you go girl, I mean who is going to bet against Tom Ford? I always found it funny that this man who designed so many fabulous clothes, always wore the same thing, but honestly how can you go wrong with a black suit and a white bespoke oxford shirt, and has anyone looked better wearing it?"
3,Aliens: Harvest is mixed bag,"Aliens: Harvest Graphic Novel ReviewGrade: CAliens: Harvest is a mixed bag, depending on what you want in an Aliens comic. If you want action(like Genocide, Rogue, Salvation) this ones not for you. If you like the more phychological Aliens comics(like Sacrifice, Labyrinth) this ones for you. I only give it 3 stars because there are some good scenes in it, but at times it gets boring and often confusing. It collects a four-issue arc, and at times feels to long, with boring dialogue. The dog was pretty cool though the way it interacted with the robotic Alien.(Yes, a robitic Alien, and yes, it does play fetch with a dog!) Overall, it's worth it for some cool scenes, otherwise only for die-hard Aliens fans only. Or you can get it in the Aliens Omnibus volume 2."
2,Aliens fans: you might want to skip this one!,"After reading practically all other Aliens novels and comics, I find this one too drawn out, too much unnecessary plot and not enough involvement of the aliens themselves. The book delves too far into the woman thief's past and the feelings of the main character, Stanislaw. I was too bored three quarters into the book and couldn't even bear to finish it."
4,Brilliant Music!!!,"This set has been re-released by EMI (deleting two songs from the previous issue, neither of which Jeff Lynne wrote or sang). These CDs feature the same mastering as before so if you were lucky enough to to have bought it there's no need to get it again. The mastering isn't great but it's not as bad as we've come to expect from Abbey Road. The digital tape hiss removal (NR) isn't as artifact laden as I anticipated. This CD is quite listenable though the mastering would've been better without the NR and heavy handed EQ."
3,Interesting,"Wise, witty account of various people having affairs, forming a chain that eventually comes full circle, all held together by sarcastic Walbrook. A film of style and charm, based on an Arthur Schnitzler play. Screenplay by Jacques Natanson and director Ophuls. Remade as CIRCLE OF LOVE and CHAIN OF DESIRE."
4,"The ""Wild Hoss of the Osage"" comes to life!","This is an excellent biography of one of baseball's truly remarkable characters. Although names like Dizzy Dean, Frankie Frisch and Leo Durocher are more reknowned, Pepper Martin was the true heart and soul of the legendary ""Gashouse Gang"" Cardinals team of the 1930's and Barthel leaves no stone unturned in detailing the life of this unique and talented ballplayer from yesteryear. News article references chronicling his World Series exploits are included and serve as a glimpse back to a time when a signing bonus consisted of a couple of hunting dogs and a Winchester rifle.Also included are numerous AP and never before seen photographs and illustrations.Pepper Martin was truly one of a kind and this book captures the essence of his life and character."
5,beats cable boxes hands down!,"I went through 2 cable boxes. First box had bad response time just to change channels on the guide. Next box responded fine, but after a few months starting randomly loosing audio (we recorded one of our favorite shows with no sound!). Cable companies put the cheapest processors and electronics in these boxes to maximize profits, so don't ever expect the performance to be anything above fair.With Tivo, they size the processor to handle the commands quickly and with very little response problems. I have a series 2 Tivo and not once did it give me any problems (going on 4 years old now). I expect the same from the series 3 and know that Tivo will take care of me if something comes up.Cable companies will never compete with Tivo for the best DVR available !!"
1,"Tivo Series3, $1000 price tag, 200x too much, BEWARE","The only thing Tivo's done right (besides allowing you to share your media with your networked computers) is additional storage via eSATA external harddrives.My Wireless G USB Tivo adapter didn't work without a software upgrade to my Tivo DVR (it came with software that was 2 years out of date). My Tivo DVR had out of date software, the cable card you are required to get to make it work is not compatible with ONDEMAND, and it costs about 200x as much as just renting a Comcast DVR.If not for the ability to add the additional storage and export media to my computer, my Tivo DVR would have been a complete rip off. As it is, I still feel cheated.If I had it to do all over again, I would have just gone with a DVR from my cable company."
4,No complaints,"After owning a Series 1 SVR2000 for over 9 years that still works great (and regretting not having purchased the lifetime membership) I finally decided to buy this Series 3 to be able to record HD programming. It delivers the same straightforward experience I was used to with my Series 1, and the universal remote now has more features. My big concern was getting the 2 cablecards working since I had read many online horror stories before getting the Tivo and was bracing myself, but either the cable compaines have improved or I got lucky because the dual cablecard setup was painless and took under 15 minutes. IMO, the Tivo Series 3 is not a device you can't live without, so I'd wait until there's a special price for either the device, the lifetime membership service or both."
5,Excellent,This TiVo TCD648250B Series3 HD Digital Media Recorder exceeded my expectations. Picture quality on HD is outstanding. Only problem I had was with Comcast trying to get a video card to work. Tivo support staff helped Comcast solve the problem after three trips to the house.
5,"If there is something good on TV any time of the day or night, TiVo will find it.","My daughter and her husband got my first TiVo for me when I went back to college in my 50's. I had very little time to watch TV and the TiVo allowed me to save up shows to watch between semesters and on spring break. I am a total addict now. That original TiVo died, but I have two newer ones now. I especially like the ability to save programs to the iPad and get video on demand off Amazon and NetFlix."
